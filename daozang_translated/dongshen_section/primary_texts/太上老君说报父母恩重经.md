# 太上老君说报父母恩重经

The *Sutra on the Profound Debt of Parental Kindness Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao*

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao was in the Yuli Mountains of the Western Kingdom of Yuna, expounding the Dao and virtue, proclaiming precepts and commandments, and broadly discoursing on the causes and conditions of the ten directions. At that moment, fifty thousand followers accompanied him to that place, reverently attending the assembly. With raised fists and crossed hands, they paid homage to the honored countenances and exchanged greetings in full.

Then, from among the assembly, a perfected one named Haikong Zhizang stepped forward, knelt at length, and addressed the Most High, saying: "We have received our bodies and skin from our parents. The kindness of parents runs deep, yet we have no means to repay it. We only hope that the Great Compassion will take pity on all beings. If we might receive your instruction, we would bear this grace in life and death."

Thereupon, the Most High was moved for a long while before speaking to Haikong Zhizang: "Excellent, excellent! Your question is most profound. Listen carefully, and I shall explain.

When the form is straight, its shadow is surely upright; when the form is crooked, its shadow is surely slanted. When the sound is clear, its echo is surely pure; when the sound is impure, its echo is surely muddied. Filial piety and its absence are just like this.

If one is filial and fraternal, within a single household, young and old live in peace and joy. Heavenly beings and humans revere them, divine spirits protect them, and their descendants inherit this virtue without cease. They attract filial children to themselves.

If one is unfilial, generation after generation, the entire household becomes a nest of enemies. Though they are father and son, they are more hostile than foes. They beget the five rebellions as their children. Father and son, brothers keep separate accounts, eat different meals, share fields but divide the grain, hide delicacies, and eat in secret like thieves. Though they bear human form, they are worse than beasts. Divine spirits do not protect them; the world despises them. All their deeds in life are inauspicious. After death, they fall into hell, enduring every torment. Once their punishment is complete, they are reborn as shrikes. When their offspring can fly, they devour their mother. After a hundred kalpas, they are reborn among humans, gathering the five rebellions and all unfilial causes, becoming father and son only to harm one another. In life and death, they suffer endlessly, cycling without cease. No suffering in the world exceeds this.

When a person is born into the world, parents are their closest kin. Without a father, there is no birth; without a mother, there is no nurture. Thus, under the shelter of heaven and earth, the mother’s womb is entrusted. Qi and consciousness coalesce, and for ten months, she carries the burden of pregnancy. Her rest and movement become irregular. When the time is full, the moment of birth arrives.

The mother fears for her life, her heart filled with sorrow and distress. Her spirit is troubled. On the day of delivery, she suffers both internal and external pain, agony pressing upon her. She cries out in anguish, enduring great torment. Trembling and terrified, she is struck with dread and lamentation.

Once born, the child is placed upon the grass, wailing. For three months, it lies on its side, constantly fearing the harm of malevolent spirits. When hungry, it needs food—only its mother feeds it. When thirsty, it needs drink—only its mother nurses it. It drinks eighty-four *sheng* of its mother’s milk. For a thousand days, she carries it, shielding it from dust and filth, placing it on dry ground while she lies in the wet. She swallows bitterness and offers sweetness. Without righteousness, no one draws near; without a mother, no one nurtures.

When it leaves the cradle and crawls upon the ground, its ten fingernails are unclean, yet it eats without care. If the mother goes east or west, grinds grain at the mill, or attends to official or private matters in haste, she cannot return in time. Yet she knows her child cries at home. The bond between mother and child is innate, their hearts and natures attuned.

The mother’s hundred bones divide to form two bodies, yet their qi and blood remain one, their two forms inseparable. When the child thinks of its mother, her heart stirs in response. She rushes home, her breasts overflowing with milk. Arriving at the gate, she sees her child in the courtyard—perhaps in the cradle, by the door, in someone’s arms, or alone, on the bed or the floor. Sometimes it sits in its own filth, sometimes it grasps mud or grass. Sometimes it cries, sometimes it nearly stops. When it lifts its eyes and sees its mother, it wails and laughs, shakes its head, and crawls toward her, dragging its belly.

Alas! It turns to its mother in sorrow. The mother bends down, stretches out her hands, wipes away the filth, blows on its mouth, and offers her breast. The child nurses, gazing at her, cooing softly. The mother rejoices at the sight of her child; the child rejoices at the sight of its mother. Their mutual affection and love are profound. No bond is closer than this.

At two or three years old, the child begins to walk and play. Cold or heat, excrement or urine—only the mother knows. When it smiles, she is happy; when it cries, she is vexed. It delights only in food, desiring nothing else. When parents return from their travels and encounter a feast, if they receive cakes or meat, they dare not eat them but carry them home to give to their child. Nine times out of ten, the child is overjoyed. If once it does not receive something, it feigns tears in a spoiled voice. This becomes its habit.

A spoiled child is unfilial; a filial child is not spoiled. There must be kindness and obedience.

As the child grows older, it follows its friends. In the prime of youth, it indulges in play and pleasure. It combs its hair, seeking fine clothes. The parents select the finest garments for their child, while they themselves wear coarse and worn-out clothes. If they lack clothing, they seek it far and wide, exhausting their efforts north and south, east and west, even selling their hairpins to arrange a marriage for their child.

Yet as the child’s affection grows stronger, the mother becomes more distant. In private chambers, they laugh and speak together."

As parents grow old, their strength wanes. From dawn to dusk, the child does not come to inquire after them. Left alone in an empty chamber, they are treated like strangers. Clothing and food are scarce; hunger and cold press upon their bodies. Their hands and feet are calloused, their ears grow deaf, their eyes dim. Their bed is thin and cold, each day stretching long as a year. Frail and emaciated, their bodies teem with lice and nits. Mosquitoes and horseflies bite their flesh, keeping them awake through the night. They sigh and lament: *"What sin have we committed to bear such an unfilial child?"* Leaning on a staff, they shuffle to call out, bowing their heads in humility. Before they can finish speaking, their child raises their voice in anger, eyes glaring, hurling curses. Turning away, the child retreats, leaning against the wall to return. The parents beat their chests in self-reproach, their eyes swelling with tears. They wail in sorrow, *"Better to have died sooner!"*

The mother says to her child: *"When you were small, had I not nurtured you, you would not have lived. Had I not fed and sheltered you, you would not have grown. I carried you for ten months, as if bearing a heavy burden. My breath came in gasps, more labored than running. At times, fever and chills left me restless, unable to sit or lie still. My belly split, my chest felt full to bursting. My hair fell out, my body wasted away—I could not eat. In the month before your birth, I was constantly fearful, dreading that we might not part. Some days were peaceful, others full of suffering. On the day of your birth, my life hung by a thread. My limbs, veins, and five organs felt as if pierced by knives, pulled by hooks, burned by fire, or chilled by ice. In that moment of separation, whether I lived or died, I endured all the sufferings of the world—words cannot describe them. Once you were born, joy and fear mingled. The pains were unbearable. For three years, I carried you day and night, never apart. I sat and slept in filth, my rest and meals untimely. I watched your every breath, tending to your hunger and thirst. When you fell ill, my heart ached. Hearing your cries of pain, I could not eat; my mouth and throat grew parched. I sought every blessing for you—gold and silver, clothing and toys—thinking only of your well-being, sparing nothing. When you were small, you followed me everywhere, never leaving my side. You ate when I ate, slept when I slept. A day without me, and you would not eat; a night without me, and you would cry without cease. How have you grown so quickly into an enemy? Now that I have you, it would have been better had I never borne you at all. I entrust this to Heaven; the unseen realm will bear witness. I only wish to pass swiftly, to be parted from you. Alas! What else can I do?"*

Then, the Most High spoke these words and manifested a divine transformation, causing the great earth to tremble. Amid the quaking, the hells of this realm were suddenly revealed. Countless beings trod upon mountains of knives, their hands pierced by trees of swords. Their tongues were torn out and impaled upon iron pillars. In agony, they wailed, their bodies festering, pus and blood oozing from every pore, their flesh torn and mangled, suffering unspeakable torment.

At this, Haikong Zhizang’s hair stood on end in terror. Tears streaming, he sobbed and addressed the Most High: *"What sins have these souls committed to endure such suffering?"*

The Most High replied: *"These are the wicked who, in life, were unfilial and unkind, who abandoned their mothers, slandered the Three Treasures, and insulted those who had left the household. Now they receive their retribution—how endless their torment! Day by day, it stretches on without end. There is no escape."*

Then the Most High spoke this verse:
*"Good naturally meets with good,
Evil returns to its evil root.
Those who in life were unfilial—
What gratitude do they repay in death?
Woe to the pain that binds them,
Passing through the eighteen gates.
Not on the Three Pardons’ days
May they ever find brief reprieve."*

When the Most High had spoken this verse, the assembly wept in sorrow, their grief unceasing. They raised their hands and snapped their fingers. In that instant, the multitude turned to gaze southward, where they beheld the Heavenly Palace of the Southern Quarters. There, good men and women moved with dignified grace, their faces radiant. Heavenly feasts of a hundred flavors and endless treasures surrounded them. In perfect beauty and freedom, they enjoyed boundless bliss.

Overjoyed, Zhizang addressed the Dao once more: *"By what merit have these beings earned such reward, dwelling in Heaven, clothed and fed by nature, enjoying such happiness?"*

The Most High replied: *"In life, they were truly filial and kind, serving their parents with devotion. They revered the Three Treasures, practiced generosity and upheld the precepts, and honored those who had left the household. Now they receive their blessed reward, its fruits without end."*

Then the Most High spoke this verse:
*"By past causes of utmost filial piety,
They served without fail, offering reverence.
With faith and respect for the Three Treasures,
Their boundless blessings now return.
In Heaven’s halls, they roam in splendor,
Their fortune towering, lofty and vast.
This joy knows no limit,
For blessings ever follow."*

When the Most High had spoken this verse, he sighed deeply and said to Haikong Zhizang: *"Excellent, excellent! The kindness of parents is as boundless as the vast heavens. Alas, O compassionate mother! How can it ever be repaid? I recall my past life, when I gestated in the womb of the Hong clan, my spirit congealing in the palace of the jade embryo for three thousand seven hundred years. Later, in the era of the Supreme Emperor, I was reborn in the womb of Mother Li, the yin and yang cycles completing their course over eighty-one years. Even now, after eons, I still fear I have not repaid her kindness. How much less can you, ordinary beings, fail to repay your debt? To exhaust all your strength and heart in devotion would still fall short of proper reverence—how much worse to transgress against them! In all the teachings and precepts, this is never left unspoken. Among the thirty-six scriptures, none omits these words. All the sages, past and present, have followed this teaching—how much more should you, who study the Dao, fail to repay your debt? All of you here must resolve deeply: outwardly, honor and serve your parents; inwardly, cultivate great kindness. Even if you ground your bones to dust and melted your flesh, you could not fully repay them. If any being can copy this scripture for their parents, recite and uphold it, burn incense and bow in reverence, and on the Zhongyuan Festival hold a grand offering, prepare fine incense, gather blossoms from the mountains, and arrange pure offerings with diligent devotion, praying for blessings and beseeching grace to deliver their ancestors—this is how to repay the kindness of parents’ nurturing. The sins of the five rebellions and ten evils will be extinguished."*

If on the first day of each month at noon, one observes a pure fast, burns incense, practices the Dao, bows in reverence, and recites this sutra, sins will also be extinguished—this is how to repay one’s parents. Moreover, on this day, one should invite a master of the highest purity and virtue to expound this sutra, elucidate its wondrous meaning, and exhort all beings to awaken hearts of kindness and filial piety. Such merit is supreme and foremost, beyond all conception. Ten thousand merits cannot compare to the act of encouraging others to lecture, recite, and repay their debt of gratitude. Among those who hear this sutra, should even one suddenly awaken a filial heart and serve their parents, their blessings and virtue will be boundless. Above, this moves all the great sages of the heavens; in the middle, it stirs the spirits of the hidden realms; below, it flows to descendants of later generations, who will all be filial and reverent without cease.

At that time, the great assembly and the Perfected of Vast Empty Wisdom Treasury, having heard the Most High expound the *Sutra on the Weight of Repaying Parents’ Kindness*, were each moved to tears. Having received these words, their filial devotion deepened, engraved in their bones and never forgotten. With profound reverence, they returned to their native lands and respectfully put the teachings into practice.

Here ends the *Sutra on the Weight of Repaying Parents’ Kindness*, spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.
