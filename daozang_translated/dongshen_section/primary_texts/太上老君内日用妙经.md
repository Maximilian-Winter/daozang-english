**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Wondrous Scripture of Internal Daily Practice**

In daily practice, when eating and drinking, maintain stillness. Sit alone in silence, allowing no single thought to arise. Forget all affairs, preserve the spirit, and stabilize the mind. Press the lips together, let the teeth gently meet, neither seeing with the eyes nor hearing with the ears. Guard the heart within, regulate the breath in an unbroken stream—subtly, lightly exhaling, as if present yet absent, never allowing interruption. Naturally, the heart’s fire descends, the kidneys’ water ascends, and the mouth fills with sweet fluid. The numinous essence enters the body, and one knows the path to longevity.

For one *shichen* each day, maintain purity and tranquility. The *lingtai* (spirit terrace) is pure when empty of things; it is tranquil when no thought arises. The body is the dwelling of *qi*, the heart the abode of spirit. Where intention moves, spirit moves; where spirit moves, *qi* disperses. Where intention rests, spirit rests; where spirit rests, *qi* gathers. The true *qi* of the Five Phases coalesces into the *daogui* (elixir knife). Naturally, sounds arise within the body—whether walking or sitting, one constantly feels the body moving like the wind, the abdomen resounding like thunder. Harmonious *qi* permeates, brewing and pouring over the crown. One drinks the *daogui* of one’s own making.

Listen to the immortal’s music of the stringless zither—unplucked, it sounds; unstruck, it resonates. Spirit and *qi* unite, like a man with child. One perceives the inner realm, and the spirit speaks of itself. This is the dwelling of emptiness and nonbeing, where one resides with the sages. After refining the Nine Cycles, the Great Elixir forms. The spirit moves freely, attaining the same lifespan as heaven and earth, the same radiance as sun and moon, transcending birth and death.

Each day, avoid all loss. In all twelve *shichen*, maintain purity and tranquility. *Qi* is the mother of spirit; spirit is the child of *qi*. Like a parrot brooding its egg, one must preserve spirit and nurture *qi*—how could they ever part?

Wondrous! Profound beyond profundity.

Within the human body lie seven treasures, which enrich the nation and pacify the people: essence, *qi*, blood, and fullness. Essence is mercury, blood is gold, *qi* is fine jade, marrow is crystal, the brain is cinnabar, the kidneys are *qiucan* (precious stone), and the heart is coral. These are the seven treasures. When they return to the body and do not scatter, the Great Medicine is refined, and all spirits ascend to immortality.
