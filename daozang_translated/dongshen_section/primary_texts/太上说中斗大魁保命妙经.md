**The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Central Dipper’s Great Culmen for Protecting Life**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Central Dipper’s Great Culmen for Protecting Life*. The author is unknown, but it likely emerged in the early Northern Song dynasty. It falsely attributes its transmission to the Supreme Venerable Lord (Laozi), who bestowed it upon the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master, expounding the rites of offering to the Great Saints of the Central Dipper to atone for sins and prolong life.

At that time, during the Yongshou era, the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Grand Clarity Realm met repeatedly with the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master Zhang in the capital of Shu. He conferred upon him the sacred writ of the Western Dipper, for the master had cultivated and reverently practiced it. Thereupon, the Supreme Venerable Lord manifested his golden body, ascending the Jade Bureau Seat amidst the Void of Purity. He proclaimed the Orthodox Teaching and uttered these words:

*"Before the golden axe falls, the mighty Queen of Heaven metes out punishment. Demons and specters are subdued—who dares disobey? Holding registers and grasping talismans, Jade Maidens and Golden Lads extend life and preserve destiny. Riding clouds and driving winds, the body undergoes refinement, transcending the world without end."*

Then the Venerable Lord intoned this incantation:

*"Behold the Central Realm, governing the Four Quarters,
Upholding the myriad forms, surpassing all norms.
Manifesting good and punishing evil, its jade chapters gleam bright,
Sweeping away ten thousand ghosts, shattering blades in their flight.
Transcending worlds without measure, its name resounds on high.
Honor and veneration dispel misfortune’s blight.
With devoted heart receive it, soaring to heaven’s height.
Hasten! As the statutes decree!"*

**First of the Central Dipper:** The Radiant and Numinous Perfected Lord Who Delivers the World
**Second of the Central Dipper:** The Revolving and Transformative Supreme Sage Perfected Lord
**Third of the Central Dipper:** The Harmonious and Perfectly Virtuous Perfected Lord

The Supreme Venerable Lord said: *"Whoever recites this scripture must purify their heart and reverently bow, closing their eyes and focusing their mind. With a single thought, they wander the vast expanse, meeting those who are delivered. They rescue the world and prolong life, dissolving calamitous karma, cleansing demonic miasmas. Through kalpas unending, their influence flows boundlessly."*

The Supreme Venerable Lord said: *"The Central Dipper alone resides at the center of the Five Heavens, with the Four Quarters arrayed in homage. Its majesty is boundless, presiding over the primordial qi of Heaven and governing all heavens. Its secret writs and luminous chapters are treasured by gods and humans. I now solemnly instruct and entrust this to be transmitted to the world below, to deliver the deluded masses and serve as a bridge for the age. If transmitted to the unworthy, should negligence arise, the Heavenly Perfected will not permit it, and misfortune will befall generations. Yet I see that you have purified your heart and stilled your thoughts, upholding reverence with unwavering diligence, steadfast from beginning to end. Thus, I shall expound for you the profound mysteries of the Central Dipper."*

The Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master then bowed his head in obeisance, listening attentively and receiving the teaching with reverence.

The Venerable Lord addressed the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master: *"Behold the vault of heaven, positioned at the center, serene and secluded. It unfolds amidst the primordial chaos, with the Four Poles as its wings. Radiant and majestic, its light shines resplendently. The Seven Governors and the Jade Mechanism revolve, the Two Luminaries submit and serve. It governs the myriad forms, upholds the cosmic order, and strictly oversees all heavens—the boundless divine realms. The Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, Twelve River Sources, Twenty-Eight Constellations, and Thirty-Two Heavens all receive its protection, bestowing blessings without calamity. It erases the ledgers of sin and extirpates the roots of evil.*

*The Eastern Dipper governs fate, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper grants life. The Great Culmen of the Central Dipper stands majestically supreme. Gods and humans receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas without end. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties and Three Obstructions—all who uphold this Orthodox Teaching ascend through the Golden Gate."*

The Venerable Lord said to the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master: *"The qi of the Central Dipper arises from the Four Dippers, completing beginnings and endings as the source of creation. The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center. No spirit transcends their dominion.*

*The Azure Heavenly Demon King, Bayuan Choubo;
The Red Heavenly Demon King, who bears the sky upon stone;
The White Heavenly Demon King, with six eyes reversed upon the mountain;
The Black Heavenly Demon King, Jianshou Langfu;
The Yellow Heavenly Demon King, who shoulders the sky’s weight—
These Five Great Demon Emperors, lords of all spirits,
Command ghostly legions to suppress and expel all malevolence.
Banners and precious weapons arrayed, their mounts are dragons of thunder,
Driving lightning and wielding thunder, they traverse the vast heavens.
The golden axe strikes first, and the Four Poles return to truth.*

*The exalted image of the Imperial Lord of Soaring Numinosity,
The Perfected Great Sage, sits in solemn dignity, encircled by spirits.
With focused mind and sincere prayer, if one’s destiny is overseen,
Blessings and longevity extend. Simply follow the scripture’s methods,
Reverently offering worship. On days of impending disaster,
Or on one’s natal day, or during the Three Primes and Eight Assemblies,
Prepare a pure altar, adorned with seasonal fruits, rare flowers, precious incense,
And proclaim the liturgical rites. Purify body and mind,
Invoke the Perfected Saints, and offer libations to atone for sins.
The Perfected Saints, rejoicing, will lengthen your years and increase your fate.
No wish will go unfulfilled; nine generations ascend to heaven,
Their names inscribed in the Immortal Capital, roaming carefree in the Supreme Clarity."*

The Venerable Lord addressed the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master: *"The sacred sounds concealed in the Five Quarters, which I once transmitted to the world below, deliver sentient beings and forever free them from sinking. They are the world’s treasure—no merit surpasses them."*

The Venerable Lord further instructed the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master: *"The talismanic writs and sacred texts of the Five Dippers, the names of the Five Dipper Perfected Lords—only those with karmic affinity with the Dao may encounter them. Offering reverence and veneration, their awe-inspiring efficacy is manifest. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune respond like echoes and shadows. You must concentrate your mind and never treat them lightly. Hold fast to devotion and reverence, heed and guard this teaching, and never forget to propagate it."*

Having entrusted these words, the Venerable Lord ascended to heaven and departed.

The Heavenly Master bowed in gratitude, transmitted the teaching to the world, and concealed it in a golden casket, delivering countless beings without end.
