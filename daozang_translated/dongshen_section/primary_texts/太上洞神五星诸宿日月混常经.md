The stars of the Northern Dipper are the essence of the Great One. On the first day of each of the four *meng* months, they descend to divine for humanity, wandering among settlements. Their discernment and discourse differ from ordinary people. Those who sincerely seek and inquire shall never go unanswered.

**Wood** is the essence of Jupiter, its nature benevolent. On *jia* or *yi* days after the Beginning of Spring, it wanders among temples and monasteries, appearing as a dignified figure of medium build with sparse whiskers, clad in green robes. It engages monks in debate on profound principles, its reasoning unmatched. Reverent and refined, its demeanor stands apart from the crowd—its eyes bright and clear, its teeth and speech fine, its responses gracious. Those who recognize it and inquire with propriety may present their heart’s desires, and all shall be granted. If one seeks wealth, it responds with benevolence, often secluding itself on *chen* days at the Eastern Marchmount.

**Fire** is the essence of Mars, its nature ritual propriety. After the Beginning of Summer, on *bing* or *ding* days, it appears as a vermilion-clad youth, fair of complexion and dignified in form, robed in brocade of rare hues and damask of exotic patterns. Keen of ear and sharp of eye, it is rich in decorum—its bows, advances, and retreats all in accord with etiquette, its speech articulate. It delights in mingling with young boys, singing and chanting in the villages, foreseeing events with uncanny clarity.

At times, it appears as an elder riding a white horse, or bearing musical instruments, ever willing to grant the requests of others. It often secludes itself on *xu* days at Mount Hua.

**Water** is the essence of Mercury, its nature wisdom.

It often secludes itself on *wu* or *ji* days at Mount Heng.

**The Sun** is the essence of the Great Yang. On *ding* or *si* days of the four *meng* months, it wanders in great marshes, clad in yellow-red robes, riding a dappled horse. It travels alone, singing and chanting for its own amusement, a satchel of texts slung upon its horse. Those who recognize it and seek it in the marshes on these days shall be taught the arts of ritual propriety, righteousness, and the scriptures of immortality. It frequents the households of noble women in great commanderies. Those who encounter it shall surely attain the arts of transcendence.

Those who seek shall attain all without obstruction, and they delight in wondrous skills displayed outwardly, so that others make no further demands of them.

The essences of **Extended Net, Wings, and Chariot** appear together as old men, dressed in yellow, riding yellow oxen and bearing wine vessels. They wander among great estates and villages. Those who seek them are often gifted wine; those who drink it shall become earthbound immortals and never die. If one speaks ill or slanders them, they shall bear deformed children and suffer the ruin of their households within three years. If one reveres them, they shall bear noble sons, and wealth shall grow of its own accord.

Whenever one encounters the divine essences of these seven stars, they shall become either a high minister or a master of the arts in their time. Within a month, they shall grow plump and fair, wealth shall come unbidden, and the wise and sagacious shall arrive without seeking. All shall meet with good fortune.

Those who encounter and seek them shall attain all their desires: naturally gaining fine official posts, beautiful wives and concubines, and splendid garments. Others shall bestow gifts upon them unbidden, for it is no feat of their own effort.

Wherever the essences of these seven stars arrive, the household shall know no poverty for generations. Those who recognize them shall not die, and all their desires shall be fulfilled.

The essences of **Dipper and Ox** often appear on *ren-zi* days as old women, fair of complexion, clad in dark green-black robes. They are eloquent and witty, carrying fine garments to sell. They favor the homes of the virtuous and the charitable, and those who receive their offerings shall honor them. If one wears their garments to court, the Son of Heaven shall favor them, and official posts shall come unbidden. If a woman wears them, she shall bear noble sons, wise and skilled in many arts, and gold and silver from the earth shall come to her without seeking.

Daily encounters shall bring ever-increasing prosperity, bearing noble sons who are destined to become high ministers. Great wealth and nobility shall come unbidden, and their beards and hair shall never whiten. Should one harbor desires yet find them unfulfilled, within a year their household shall be ruined, their kin perish, and they shall bear sightless children. Of the first seven stars, those who encounter them shall earn universal reverence—whatever they desire shall come to pass without seeking, and the aged shall regain their youth.
