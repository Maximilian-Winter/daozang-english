**The Most High Lord Lao Spoke the Heart Sutra**

In cultivating the Dao, first observe the heart-mind.
The heart-mind governs the spirit; movement and stillness follow the heart-mind.
When the heart-mind moves, there is no stillness; when it does not move, one attains the true.
The heart-mind is the root of misfortune, the heart-mind is the origin of the Dao.
Neither moving nor still, neither conceiving nor abiding.
Without heart-mind, without movement—yet if there is movement, it arises from the heart-mind.
Understanding the heart-mind’s true nature, understanding the nature’s true heart-mind.
The heart-mind abides nowhere; where there is abiding, there is no heart-mind.
Understanding non-attachment, non-attachment turns to the true.
Emptiness, the emptiness of emptiness—emptiness itself attains the true.

Lord Lao said: From kalpas without measure, I observed the heart-mind and attained the Dao, reaching even to emptiness and nothingness—what was there to gain? For the sake of all sentient beings, I reluctantly name it "attaining the Dao."

Lord Lao said: I observe that sentient beings, not understanding their heart-minds, labor in vain through endless kalpas, exhausting their spirits in futility. Without understanding the heart-mind, they sink into eternal perdition. Follow my sacred teachings and roam freely, embracing the true.
