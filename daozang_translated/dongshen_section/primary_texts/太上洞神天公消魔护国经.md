### *The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State, Scroll One*

#### **Chapter One: The Liberation of Beings**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, together with the Heavenly Emperors of the myriad heavens, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Sages of the Limitless, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, jade lads and jasper maidens, the Three Supreme Masters, and the attendant hosts of perfected beings, were expounding the Dao within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Mysterious Metropolis, broadly liberating all beings.

At that moment, the radiance of the sun and moon illuminated the world, and heaven and earth were at peace. The Celestial Worthy emitted a five-colored light that suffused the limitless worlds of the myriad heavens, reaching upward to the Thirty-Two Heavens and downward to the dark hells of the netherworld. The divine radiance shone universally, aiding boundless beings, causing those in darkness and light alike to attain tranquility, receive manifold joys, and suffer no illness or harm. Heavenly incense wafted everywhere, and auspicious winds spread far and wide. The hungry feasted on golden rice, the thirsty drank jade nectar, and starving ghosts and destitute souls were all sated. Their spirit-souls transcended their karmic retribution, hells were pacified, and the ranks of immortals gradually ascended. Swiftly they escaped suffering, beheld the Celestial Worthy face-to-face, and ascended to the Land of Florescence, dwelling eternally in the Dharma assembly.

At that time, among the assembly was a perfected being named Limitless, who rose from his seat, draped in a cloud-embroidered robe, holding a jade blossom. Having adjusted his attire and cap, he respectfully performed the rites. When the rites were complete, he knelt in profound reverence and, bowing his head, addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:

“By the fortune of past blessings, your servant has been permitted to attend this assembly. I have heard the golden words of the Celestial Worthy unfolding the wondrous gate, causing all beings in the great earth—both hidden and manifest—to attain peace. Yet I now observe that in the lands below, the people suffer myriad evils: some are afflicted by floods, some by fires, some by famine, some by bandits, some by epidemics, some by great droughts. The five grains do not ripen, grasses and trees wither and die, the borders of the state are unsettled, and the people live in fear. The weight of these karmic burdens grieves my heart. I wish to save them, but lack the means. Thus, I now vow to deliver and govern all beings. I implore the lofty perfected ones to graciously bestow their methods, for the utility of the Dao begins with nurturing life. I beg to aid all beings and free them from these calamities.”

Then the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:

“Excellent! Excellent! You now can make a great vow for all beings in the great earth, undertaking vast beneficence. With utmost sincerity, you seek to deliver and protect them, freeing them from calamities. The merit of benefiting beings is profound and far-reaching!

I now command the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, the Perfected of Jade Purity, the Perfected of the Cavern Sovereign, the hosts of hundreds of millions, the twenty myriad Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Heavenly Numinous Red Officials, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the eight million hosts of Lord Han the Elder, the thirty myriad hosts of heavenly and earthly immortals, the myriad hosts of the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Subduer of Poisons, the Dispeller of Demons, the Devourer of Evils, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, and the gods of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—to traverse the world and deliver beings from all calamities.

For all beings who encounter the perils of water or fire, if they but concentrate their minds and sincerely pray, reciting this scripture, they shall be saved. If they encounter bandits or thieves, let them recite this scripture. If they suffer epidemics, let them recite this scripture. If they face great droughts, let them recite this scripture. If the state’s borders are unsettled, let them recite this scripture. If the five grains do not ripen, let them recite this scripture. If ten thousand affairs are discordant, let them recite this scripture.

Those who transcribe and venerate this scripture shall naturally attract the Nine Heavens’ Generalissimo of the Three Realms, the Generals of the Three and Five, the Divine Generals of the Six Jia, the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Perfected of Compassion, Jade Purity, and the Cavern Sovereign, the Jade Purity Divine Lads, the Merit Officers and Registrars, the Longevity Marshals, the heavenly and earthly immortals, the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword, the Dispeller of Demons, the Subduer of Poisons, the Devourer of Evils and Ghosts, the Vanquisher of Demons, the Collector of Pestilences, the Flying Immortal Divine Kings, the Three Masters of Precepts, the Lords of Wind and Rain, and the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they shall descend from the void, gathering at the place where the scripture is recited, bestowing boundless blessings.

All malign poisons shall be dispelled, all evil bandits shall scatter and disperse, all epidemic toxins shall naturally vanish, floods and fires shall spontaneously cease, unsettled borders shall attain peace, the four barbarians shall submit, foreign states shall come to pay tribute, epidemics and illnesses shall be cured, quarrels and disputes shall end, official oppression and fetters shall swiftly be undone, and the bonds of karmic retribution shall be severed. Demons and evils shall not arise.”

Then the Perfected Limitless again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying:

“Within the world, all beings frequently suffer from scorching droughts and such tormenting heat. What methods may be employed to bring harmonious winds and rains, ensuring the abundant ripening of the five grains?”

The Celestial Worthy spoke to the Perfected Limitless, saying:

“You must now receive my teachings and practice them diligently. You may establish an altar on a high mountain, by a riverbank, before a cavern or cliff, in a pure and secluded place, within a Daoist abbey, or in a household. Install the honored images, hang banners and canopies, five-colored pennants, and variegated jeweled parasols. Light lamps, burn incense, bathe, and observe the fast. Offer various flowers and fruits, widely expound the teachings, and establish the altar. Recite the scripture and perform the ritual circumambulation, making grand offerings to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Sages, the Great Heavenly Emperor of Jade Purity, the Limitless Celestial Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the Ten Directions, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Heavens and Five Bushels, the Nine Luminaries and hosts of stars, and all the immortals and numinous officials, along with the dragon spirits.

By undertaking such vast beneficence, the Celestial Worthy shall dispatch the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Great Demons of the Five Directions, the Lords of Wind and Rain, to stir thunder and move mists, circling the world. In an instant, winds and rains shall answer the prayers, and rivers, streams, and gullies—both high and low fields—shall be universally moistened. Grasses, trees, and forests, all flowers, fruits, and grains shall flourish, their branches and leaves luxuriant.”

The Primordial Celestial Worthy then proclaimed this hymn of praise:

The northern winds drift and sigh,
The western clouds gather in solemn array.
The southern vermilion phoenix takes flight,
The eastern nine dragons hover and sway.

True persons bear the celestial talismans,
Commanding the rains and thunders of heaven.
They descend to shield the peaks of Kunlun,
Universally moistening all suffering sprouts.

At that time, the Boundless Perfected One again addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: "From kalpas without measure, I have rarely encountered such an occasion. Today, I have heard this wondrous and subtle scripture, and witnessed the salvation of all beings through transformations beyond conception. By what name should this sutra be called, and how should we, your disciples, receive and uphold it?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "This sutra shall be named *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm: The Chapter of Liberation*. You should diligently propagate it, reverently receive it upon your crown, and hold it in utmost esteem. Should any foolish person treat it with disdain, they shall fall into the evil destinies and suffer in the long night."

At that moment, the assembled hosts of heavenly beings and immortals all received the scripture, paid homage, and departed.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm*.
Here begins the second scroll of *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Celestial Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the Realm*.

**Chapter Two: Responding to the Moment**

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao sat in the Numinous Treasure Hall of the Great Clarity’s immortal realm, leaning upon his armrest and holding a jade whisk, expounding the Dao to deliver humankind. The Perfected One Yin Xi, the immortals of the ten directions, and jade maidens with golden lads bearing tablets and incense stood in attendance to his left and right.

Then, the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate at the Crown led forth a numinous official, who bore a vermilion text in a blue-green case. Before the Jasper Pool, they presented their memorial, and upon its completion, offered up the case before withdrawing in reverent haste.

Thereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi stepped forward, made obeisance, and addressed Lord Lao, saying: "I, Xi, have attended upon the Most High to this day, and at every assembly of the immortals, when the hosts of heaven present their memorials, there are always true portents. Yet just now, I saw the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate lead a numinous official to the Jasper Pool, where they presented their memorial and offered up a case before withdrawing in haste. I, dull and slow of wit, humbly beseech your sagely compassion to deign to explain this."

Lord Lao replied: "You have asked well, and I shall respond to the moment. This concerns Wang Fajin, a disciple of the Golden Elixir from Linjin County in Jianzhou, who wears the registers and practices the Dao. He performed the Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s ritual fast, reciting scriptures and bowing in homage day and night, his merits and memorials borne aloft by flying dragon couriers to reach the Crown Gate. Thus did the Chamberlain of the Golden Gate follow protocol to present him."

Lord Lao continued: "The Celestial Lord’s fast originates from the nine grades of ritual fasts for petitions and thanksgiving. It is through this that faithful men and women in the world awaken to the great Dao’s generation and transformation, moved by the heavens’ covering and the earth’s bearing. The Three Primes illumine above, the Five Phases nourish below; cold and heat alternate, water and fire harmonize. The benefits of the five soils are apportioned, the seasons’ rhythms followed. Above, the celestial perfected are revered; below, the young and old are nurtured. The household prospers in joy, all things follow their will; divine spirits guard the gates, and malevolent spirits hide in retreat.

On the six fast days and ten auspicious months, an auspicious time is chosen, the dwelling purified, and the ritual space arranged to mirror heaven and earth. Images are hung, banners displayed, and the altar established. At its center are the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor; next, the perfected of the ten directions, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the Three Primes and Three Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Heavenly Sovereign and Earthly Queen, the hosts of heaven and constellations, the immortals of the Three Realms, the Lords of Wind and Rain, the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, the Year-Star Spirit of Void-Space Surveillance, the Celestial Worthies, Fuxi and Shennong, the Gods of Soil and Grain, the Treasuries of Wealth, the Guardians of Life and Longevity, the great mountains and rivers, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Four Duty Envoys, the local earth spirits and numinous officials, the Memorial-Supervising Officers, and the guardians of the ritual space.

The household purifies itself, and with utmost sincerity, they invite Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters—three, five, or seven in number—for one or three days. Seasonal fruits, tea, wine, incense, flowers, aquatic plants, and pure offerings are prepared, along with ritual cloths, silver coins, cloud-horses, life-grain, and patterned silks. Lamps are lit, incense burned, and the Dao is practiced according to the rites. When the altar rites conclude, merits are proclaimed, and the perfected are rewarded. Memorials and petitions are presented, beseeching blessings. These are entrusted to the Four Duty Envoys, who convey the petitions, while the numinous officials, memorial-supervising officers, and courier dragon riders transmit the documents aloft to the Three Clarities. The Three Clarities record the merits, promote goodness, and issue edicts to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the local immortal officials, the city gods and earth spirits, the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, and the local earth gods. All receive the celestial talismans and surround the site of the fast, and for this reason, such manifestations occur."

The Perfected One Yin Xi and the assembled immortals bowed in gratitude and again addressed Lord Lao, saying: "The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord’s fast indeed evokes wondrous responses, profound beyond measure. Yet we remain ignorant of its origins—how did this fast come to be? We, dull and unenlightened, wish to hear your sagely words."

Lord Lao replied: "Long ago, while dwelling in the realm of the Three Clarities, I observed that all beings in the world had grown dissolute with the times, the great simplicity gradually scattering. The common people had lost the Dao, and perverse winds flourished. They disrespected the Two Modes, despised wind and rain, scorned the hundred grains, and squandered silk and cotton. They were unfilial and unkind, unbenevolent and unjust, devoted to heterodox teachings, and wantonly sacrificed to ghosts and spirits. They envied the worthy and resented the capable, were miserly, greedy, and lustful, failed to honor the great Dao, and harmed creatures, injuring life. Thus did ghosts and spirits grow harmful in their excess, heaven and earth send down calamities, floods and fires follow one another, the five grains fail to flourish, pestilence spread, and plague demons arise in competition. The myriad people suffered in misery, blaming heaven and resenting earth. Moved by compassion for beings who did not comprehend sin and fortune, I expounded the thirty-six revered scriptures, unfolded the Three Caverns’ numinous talismans, established the nine grades of ritual fasts, and set forth the nine-cycled elixir formulas, enabling all beings to awaken to the Dao through the scriptures, dispel evil by wearing the registers, summon the perfected through fasting, cultivate truth and refine conduct, return to the true, attain the Dao, and thereby attain long life.

The thirty-six revered scriptures comprise the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Truth, the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Mystery, and the Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern of Spirit—thirty-six divisions in all, totaling 1,884,220 scrolls.

The Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Truth expound the Dao of heaven and earth’s creation, the ebb and flow of yin and yang, the nine-cycled return of the elixir, the golden liquid’s refinement of form, and the flight of immortals.

The Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Mystery expound the Dao of dispelling calamities, curing illnesses, repenting transgressions, and praying for exorcism, delivering and uplifting the living and the dead.

The Twelve Divisions of the Cavern of Spirit expound the Dao of governing the state, managing the household, and cultivating the self.

The Three Caverns’ numinous talismans are those of the Highest Clarity, the Middle Methods, and the Orthodox Unity.

The nine grades of ritual fasts comprise twenty-seven types: the Grand Perfected Fast, the Golden Register Fast, the Jade Register Fast, the Illuminating Truth Fast, the Natural Fast, the Yellow Register Fast, the Three Primes Fast, the Suffering Fast, the Cavern of Spirit Fast, the Divine Incantation Fast, the Nine Heavens Fast, the Instruction Fast, the Orthodox Unity Fast, the Celestial Treasure Fast, the Nine Dark Realms Fast, the Five Refinements Fast, the Great Peace Fast, the Great One Fast, the Eight Emperors Fast, the Three Sovereigns Fast, the Highest Clarity Fast, the Great Cavern Fast, the Golden Chamber Fast, the Northern Emperor Fast, the Five Emperors Fast, the Huahua Fast, the Numinous Treasure Fast, and the Celestial Lord Fast—each practiced in accordance with the occasion."

The Golden Register, Jade Register, and Nine Heavens Fasts are the fasts of emperors and kings, not to be practiced by ministers or commoners. The Yellow Register Fast broadly delivers the three paths of suffering, extending its blessings to all beings, and aids both the living and the deceased. The Numinous Treasure Celestial Lord Fast bears the great Dao’s generative power, repays the heavens and earth for their nurturing embrace, resolves the transgressions of all living beings, invokes future blessings and felicity, prays for timely winds and rains, abundant harvests of the hundred grains, the elimination of plagues and poisons, and the bestowal of fortune and longevity. Those who undertake this fast must purify their thoughts and concentrate their spirit, offering sincere devotion—then blessings and virtue will descend as swiftly as an echo answers sound.

At that time, Lord Lao addressed Yin Xi again, saying: "Formerly, our ancestral master, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, dwelled in the Three Clarities with the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. Observing the eighty-one kingdoms of the Western Regions, such as Khotan, which partake of the qi of western metal essence—foul in odor, fierce in nature, indulging in lust and delighting in slaughter, wantonly harming living beings, neither rulers nor ministers, neither fathers nor sons—their cruelty was boundless, their karmic transgressions ever deepening. I received the golden words of the Primordial Great Dao, commanding me to transform the Hu in the Western Regions. Arriving at the Hangu Pass, where you served as the pass officer, I saw that your nature and destiny aligned with the Dao, and your devotion to the true was unwavering. Thus, I bestowed upon you the Golden Elixir. After a thousand days of cultivation, we were to meet at the Green Sheep Market in Great Shu, where you would ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Traversing the Nine Heavens, you would pay homage to the Jade Emperor. Though you attained the Dao, you have yet to comprehend the subtle and wondrous transformations of the Primordial Great Dao. You must now listen with utmost sincerity, for I shall explain it to you.

Before heaven and earth divided, before the sun and moon shone, before the stars spread forth, before the myriad things took form—vast and boundless, chaotic and obscure—there was the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, born before heaven and earth, without ancestor or lineage, coalescing alone, nameless and formless, subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, endlessly transforming, fathomless in depth. He then generated the primordial qi, which nurtured the Five Agents. The Five Agents gave rise to one another, and thus heaven and earth came into being. Once heaven and earth were separated, movement and stillness took shape. Thus, heaven received the pure qi, ascending and congealing above; earth received the turbid qi, descending and solidifying below; the harmonious qi in between transformed and gave birth to the myriad spirits.

The sun arose from yang essence, the moon from yin spirit. The Eastern Dipper was established in the east, where the Five Agents correspond to wood, governing the spring’s generation. The Southern Dipper was set in the south, where the Five Agents correspond to fire, governing the summer’s growth and nourishment. The Western Dipper was arrayed in the west, where the Five Agents correspond to metal, governing the autumn’s harvest and ripening. The Northern Dipper was erected in the north, where the Five Agents correspond to water, governing the winter’s storage and preservation. The Central Dipper was arranged in the center, where the Five Agents correspond to earth, governing the four seasons, for all things depend on earth to transform and generate naturally. Once the Five Dippers were arrayed, the stars took their positions. How could the celestial patterns be mere ornament? They manifest the Dao of water, fire, metal, and the Golden Elixir—those who perceive it flourish."

Then Lord Lao offered this hymn of praise:
"Before heaven and earth,
The Primordial Supreme Immortal.
Without lineage or ancestor,
Alone he coalesced.
Nurturing the primordial qi,
The Five Agents came first.
Turbid qi became earth,
Pure qi became heaven.
Harmonious qi became humankind,
Scattered as mountains and rivers.
Stars arrayed in order,
Sun and moon hung on high.
Wood Star in the east,
Metal Star in the west.
Northern Dipper in the Kan position,
Southern Dipper in the Li.
Spring, summer, autumn, winter,
Sequentially they shift.
Metal born of water,
Linked with wood.
Fire gives rise to earth,
Mutually opposing, mutually cherishing.
Nine returns, seven reversals,
Matched in the heavens.
Those who perceive it flourish,
Those who refine it become immortals.
The profound Dao is wondrous,
Mysterious and ever more mysterious."

Lord Lao said: "The Primordial Heavenly Worthy generated the Three Qi from the One Qi, and the Three Qi generated the Nine Qi. The Three Qi are the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Originative. From the qi of the Mysterious One, the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm of the Great Luo Heaven was transformed—its jasper towers and jeweled halls, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy resides, known as the Dragon Han Kalpa. From the qi of the Primordial One, the Upper Clarity True Realm of the Yu Yu Heaven was transformed—its jade towers and jeweled halls, forests of treasure trees, where the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord resides, known as the Red Brightness Middle Kalpa. At that time, the Most High Dao Lord was the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Beginning Azure Heaven, summoned the boundless sacred hosts of the ten directions to the Treasure Grove, where they received the transmission of the Dao and its teachings.

From the qi of the Originative One, the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm was transformed—its pearl towers and golden palaces, halls of the seven treasures, where I reside, known as the Kaihuang Present Kalpa. I, in turn, was the disciple of the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. These Three Clarities and Three Sages each arose through the transformation of a kalpa, known as the Three Clarities’ Upper Realm, the Great Luo Heaven’s Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis.

Moreover, the Three Qi each generated Three Qi, transforming into Nine Qi, which formed the Nine Heavens. Beyond the Three Clarities, the Nine Heavens were arrayed, where the Nine Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Nine Heavenly Immortals are:
First, the Boundless Joy Heaven of Yudan;
Second, the Upper Superior Meditation Heaven of Endless Life;
Third, the Brahma Supervisor Heaven of Xuyan;
Fourth, the Serene and Silent Heaven of Doushu;
Fifth, the Joyous and Unarrogant Heaven of Pāramitā;
Sixth, the Responsive Transformation Heaven of Dongyuan;
Seventh, the Numinous Transformation Heaven of Brahma’s Assistants;
Eighth, the Lofty and Void Heaven of Clarity;
Ninth, the Heaven of No Thought, No Attachment, No Desire.

Beyond the Nine Heavens lie the Thirty-Two Heavens, where the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords reside. The titles of the Eight Eastern Heavens are:
Great August Yellow Radiance Heaven,
Great Brightness Jade Perfection Heaven,
Clarity and Brightness Haotong Heaven,
Mysterious Womb Level Nurturing Heaven,
Void Transcending Heng Heaven,
Great Ultimate Veiled Heaven,
Primordial Brightness Wenju Heaven,
Upper Brightness Seven Luminaries Ma Yi Heaven.

The titles of the Eight Southern Heavens are:
Vermilion Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven,
Mysterious Brightness Reverent Splendor Heaven,
Radiant Brightness Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven,
Zhuoluo August Reed Heaven,
Void Brightness Hall of Luminaries Heaven,
Observing Brightness Upright Serenity Heaven,
Mysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven,
Great Resplendence Ultimate Jade Heaven."

The titles of the Eight Western Heavens are:
Primordial Ascent Kongsheng Heaven,
Great Peace August Cliff Heaven,
Manifest Destiny Ultimate Wind Heaven,
First August Filial Mang Heaven,
Great August Wengchong Furong Heaven,
No-Thought Jiangyou Heaven,
Upper Divination Ruanle Heaven,
Ultimate Non-Being Tanshi Heaven.

The titles of the Eight Northern Heavens are:
Luminous Court Xiaodu Heaven,
Abyssal Passage Wudong Heaven,
Great Literature Hanchong Miaocheng Heaven,
Great Simplicity Xiule Jin Shang Heaven,
Great Void Supreme Constant Fusion Heaven,
Great Release Jade Dragon Ascendant Victory Heaven,
Dragon Transformation Brahman Passage Heaven,
Great Ultimate Level Nurturing Jiayi Heaven.

Though these heavens exist, they remain bound by kalpic fate. Thereupon, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord composed the *Four Scrolls of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, condensing clouds into seal-script, each character a full ten feet in breadth, its eight corners trailing radiance. One scroll was placed to guard the Eight Eastern Heavens, one the Eight Southern Heavens, one the Eight Western Heavens, and one the Eight Northern Heavens, thereby preserving and restraining kalpic fate to ensure the heavens endure forever.

The Numinous Writ for the Eight Eastern Heavens reads:
Danlou Ahui, Wuhe Guanyin.
Xuyan Mingshou, Falan Putan.
Jiana Ayu, Huhu Liuyin.
Huadu Quli, Xianpu Yuzhen.
Tailuo Dafan, Sanyan Qingyun.
Feisa Yudu, Mingmo Shangmen.
Wuxing Shangshou, Huizhi Liuxuan.
Atuo Longluo, Sixiang Xuyuan.

The Numinous Writ for the Eight Southern Heavens reads:
Nanyan Dongfu, Yumou Shenxian.
Fanxing Luokong, Jiuling Weiqian.
Zeluo Puti, Lüluo Daqian.
Miaomang Jiuchou, Shaoyao Yuanzhan.
Yunshang Jiudu, Feisheng Ziqian.
Nayu Yufu, Moluo Falun.
Hongchi Wujing, Lanzi Yunrong.
Fulang Kuoyi, Shenying Zigong.

The Numinous Writ for the Eight Western Heavens reads:
Daoli Chanyou, Poni Joutong.
Wansou Dishe, Taimiao Zhitang.
Liuluo Fanmeng, Jingwei Xiaoyu.
Yimiao Wuji, Wanshou Shaodu.
Alan Yuzhu, Huamo Yanyou.
Jiukai Zibian, Anapin Shou.
Wuliang Fugai, Fuluo Heshen.
Yudan Changsang, Bokong Duxian.

The Numinous Writ for the Eight Northern Heavens reads:
Juewu Ziyu, Jiuri Daoqian.
Kunmu Dongfu, Xingshe Shangxuan.
Tuoluo Yumiao, Miaogi Heyun.
Feitian Dashou, Zongjian Shangtian.
Shatuo Jieliang, Longhan Yingxian.
Biluo Fuli, Kongge Baozhen.
Eyi Wupin, Dongmiao Zizhen.
Yuanfan Huimo, Youji Duren.

Thus the sun and moon course through their orbits, the stars array their radiance, the Five Phases alternate in function, the Four Seasons flow in harmony. Day and night, cold and heat, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, the Wind Earl and Rain Master—all ascend to follow the celestial constants, each attending to its appointed office.

The Eulogy states:
The Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin
Arises from the Dao and takes form.
The Three Qi transform and evolve,
Giving birth to the Jade Capital.
Jewel palaces and jade halls,
Precious trees towering and grand.
The Lord of the Great Luo Heaven,
Dwells in the Three Clarities’ realm.
The Three Clarities’ ministers,
Complete their work in three kalpas.
The Three Qi still extend,
Giving rise to the Nine Heavens.
The Nine Heavens respond to change,
And the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Palaces of seven treasures,
Guarded by jade scrolls.
Preserving and restraining kalpic fate,
Ensuring the heavens endure forever.
The sun and moon revolve,
The constellations stretch in sequence.
The Five Phases without flaw,
The Four Seasons proclaim their course.
Day and night,
Impartial and unbiased.
The Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother,
The Wind Earl and Rain Master,
Reverently obey Heaven’s mandate,
Each attending to its office.
When the Jade Candle is harmonized,
All things flourish.
The Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Its merit profound and selfless.

Here ends the *Central Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*.

The *Lower Scroll of the Most High Cavern Spirit Heavenly Lord’s Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*
**Chapter Three: The Governance of All Under Heaven**

The Lord Lao said: The Heavenly Lord embodies the Heavenly Dao—impartial and selfless. The Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother are the Great Jade Emperor of Heaven. Once Heaven and Earth and the myriad things were complete, the Primordial Beginning Great Dao withdrew into non-action, and thus commanded the Jade Emperor to govern the Three Realms, to shelter and nurture all living beings with impartiality and selflessness.

He appointed the Earthly Mother as the Earthly Empress, charged the Heavenly Officials with the Celestial Bureau, the Earthly Officials with the Earthly Courts, and the Water Officials with the Watery Realms. He arrayed the Four Seas and Five Peaks, the famous mountains and great rivers, the cavern grottoes and blessed lands, each assigned to immortal officials for governance.

He further dispatched the Directors of Destiny and Registrars, the Day Patrols and Moon Circuits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Attendants, the Four Duty Envoys, the Void Observers, and the local Earth Gods and Mountain Spirits—all divided into offices and ranks, patrolling the world to investigate right and wrong. Thus the Son of Heaven in the human realm, emulating Heaven and Earth, established a capital in the Central Plains and distributed the Nine Provinces and Hundred Prefectures, the Four Barbarians and Eight Wild Tribes.

He appointed officials for the Four Seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—along with the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, civil and military officials, each assigned to their offices to govern all under Heaven.

The Son of Heaven is no ordinary mortal; he is endowed with the true primordial essence of the One Qi. Through successive generations, he descends to be born, as an Upper Immortal in the celestial realms or an Upper Constellation in the heavens. All receive the mandate of the Great Dao and Jade Emperor, descending in accordance with the cosmic cycles and ascending in turn—such is the celestial reckoning.

Therefore, the Northern Asterism stands above while the host of stars pay homage. In the heavens, there are the Emperor’s Seat Star, the Empress and Consort Stars, the Crown Prince Star, the Princes’ Stars, the Three Terraces Stars, the Four Inner Assistants Stars, the Feudal Lords’ Stars, the Lord’s Foundation Star, the Minister’s Foundation Star, the People’s Foundation Star, the Literary Star, and the Martial Star. Below, the myriad things correspond to the myriad stars above.

Heaven and Earth are truly the children of the Great Dao, and the myriad things are the grandchildren of the Great Dao. The Great Dao is the origin of Heaven and Earth, and the Two Modes are the root of the myriad things. Yin and yang ascend and descend, Heaven and Earth’s qi intermingle, and then the hundred grains are sown to universally succor all living beings. The Great Dao’s work in the cosmos is profound beyond measure, silently nurturing the myriad things without claiming virtue or benevolence. The myriad things naturally return to it, yet its merit does not presume to govern. Thus, through fasting and uprightness, one repays the grace of the Great Dao, Heaven, and Earth.

Praise says:
Heaven the Father, Earth the Mother,
Hou Tu and the Jade Emperor.
Once Heaven and Earth were established,
the Three Pure Ones withdrew and concealed themselves.
The Jade Emperor received the mandate,
governing all directions.
The celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic domains—
the Three Officials preside over them.
The sacred peaks, rivers, and grotto-palaces
are the chambers of the host of immortals.
The Controllers of Destiny and Record-Keepers,
the Sun’s procession and the Moon’s course.
Years, months, days, and hours—
the Four Vigilant Deva-Kings.
They patrol the world below,
rectifying and investigating inauspicious signs.

The Son of Heaven among men
founds states and establishes domains.
Gazing up and looking down,
he constructs the Hall of Light.
Modeling Heaven and emulating Earth,
he turns from yin and faces yang.
The Nine Provinces and ten thousand states,
the distant wilds of the Four Barbarians.
The Three Terraces and Four Assistants,
the civil and military officials.
They divide offices and array duties,
thereby gathering all under Heaven.
Without action, without affairs,
he dons the crown and lets his robes hang loose.

The highest immortals and stellar lodges,
below they become emperors and kings.
Receiving Heaven’s calendar,
above and below know no constancy.
The Northern Asterism stands above,
the Three Terraces at its side.
Empresses, consorts, and crown princes,
the feudal lords and hundred kings.
The Son of Heaven, august and solemn,
the feudal lords, resplendent and grand.
Below, they nurture the myriad kinds;
above, they serve the azure vault.
Their merit reaches Heaven and Earth,
bestowing blessings and felicity.
Clouds move and rain descends,
universally moistening without bound.
The hundred grains yield harvest,
the myriad things suffer no harm.
Greatly aiding all living beings,
granaries fill a thousandfold.
The Great Dao and Heaven and Earth—
their mysterious work is measureless.

Thus, celestial fasts are established
to celebrate peace and well-being.

Laozi says: All people
are born bearing the wondrous qi of the Dao and Heaven and Earth.
Thus, the head is round, emulating Heaven;
the feet are square, emulating Earth.
Flesh resembles soil,
bones resemble stone,
qi resembles wind,
blood resembles water.
The eyes resemble the sun and moon,
hair resembles grasses and trees.
Hearing resembles the primordial caverns,
speech resembles thunder’s roar.
Waking resembles day,
sleep resembles night.
Walking resembles clouds,
sitting resembles mountains.
Joy resembles clear skies,
anger resembles rain.
The five viscera resemble the Five Phases,
the four limbs resemble the Four Qi.
The nine orifices resemble grottoes,
corresponding to the number of yang.

Moreover, the four limbs, five viscera, six bowels,
movement and stillness, joy and anger—
all emulate Heaven and Earth.
Are they not born of the wondrous qi of the Dao and Heaven and Earth?

Laozi says: When any being is conceived,
Heaven sends the Controllers of Destiny and Record-Keepers
to constantly protect and shield them.
If a male is born, the myriad spirits proclaim goodness;
if a female is born, the myriad spirits chant reverence.
Their names are registered in the Three Origins,
recorded in the Supreme Emperor’s ledgers.
The Eastern Dipper inscribes their lifespan,
the Western Dipper records their name.
The Northern Dipper marks their death,
the Southern Dipper bestows life.
The Original Chronogram guards their destiny,
the Central Dipper extends their years.
The Great Dao gives them life,
the utmost virtue nurtures them.
The Five Phases complete them,
High Heaven covers them,
Earth’s depths bear them,
the sun and moon illuminate them,
the stars and constellations protect them,
the divine luminaries guard them,
the Four Qi propel them,
wind and rain moisten them,
silk and cotton clothe them,
human relationships sustain them.
Great music harmonizes them,
great ritual restrains them,
the Great Lord oversees them.
The Great Dao and Heaven and Earth’s
life-giving work—how wondrous!
How great! How supreme!

All living beings,
if they awaken to this,
should wholeheartedly revere the Dao,
devoutly honor Heaven and Earth, their parents,
the sun, moon, stars, and constellations.
Above, they accord with Heaven’s constancy;
below, they apportion Earth’s benefits.
Fathers are kind, children filial;
elder brothers friendly, younger brothers respectful.
As ministers, they are consummately loyal;
as rulers, consummately sagely.
The Great Dao bestows protection,
Heaven and Earth send down felicity.
They refine their forms with golden elixir,
attaining long life and enduring vision.

If they slight and insult the Great Dao,
disrespect Heaven and Earth,
discard and despise the five grains,
squander silk and cotton,
turn from the Dao and venerate heterodoxy,
indulge in lust and commit murder,
revile wind and curse rain,
slander and defame scriptures—
then the Dao will not give them life,
Heaven will not cover them,
Earth will not bear them,
the sun and moon will not shine upon them,
the stars and constellations will not protect them,
the divine luminaries will not guard them,
the Four Qi will not propel them,
wind and rain will not be harmonious,
the five grains will not nourish them,
silk and cotton will not clothe them,
human relationships will not sustain them.
Great music will not harmonize them,
great ritual will not restrain them,
the Great Lord will not oversee them.
They will be poor and lowly,
afflicted by chronic illness.
When their allotted karma is exhausted,
the Executioners will come to punish them.
Having departed the human realm,
they will sink into hell,
enduring every torment and torture,
agonies unbearable.
Embracing the bronze pillar in heat,
lying on the iron bed in cold,
sawed by blades of gold,
wounded by knives of iron,
swallowing fire and eating coals—
forever they will fall into evil destinies,
with no hope of escape.

Now, for you and all living beings,
I expound this wondrous scripture.
Revere and uphold it,
diligently practice it.

Thus, the praise says:

The Great Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth,
its principle is to give life and nurture.
Humans and the myriad beings
all receive the same qi.
What is spoken as constant,
when verified, is precious.
The head, round, resembles Heaven;
the feet, square, resemble Earth.
Flesh is like soil, bones like stone,
qi like wind, blood like water.
The voice echoes thunder,
hair resembles grass.
Gloom and haze signify anger,
clear skies signify joy.
Day mirrors wakefulness,
night mirrors sleep.
Movement is like drifting clouds,
sitting like a mountain’s stillness.
The five viscera and four limbs
correspond to the Five Phases and four qi.
The teeming multitudes,
crowned with hair and bearing teeth—
the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth
gives life to you and nurtures you.
All living beings,
turn inward and reflect.

When male and female unite in essence,
the womb begins its work.
The Lords of Life and Record
guard and bestow the spirit.
The father’s heavenly qi,
the mother’s earthly essence—
after ten months, the fetus emerges,
mother and child separate in form.
Males are born face down,
females face up.
For males, the ten thousand spirits praise goodness;
for females, the ten thousand spirits delight in harmony.
Above, they are linked to the celestial courts;
in the middle, to the stars.
The Three Primes hold their registers,
the Five Emperors oversee their reception.
The Eastern Dipper governs lifespan,
the Western Dipper records names.
The Northern Dipper marks death,
the Southern Dipper grants life.
The Original Chronogram protects destiny,
the Central Dipper extends longevity.
Virtue and the Dao give life,
Heaven and Earth shelter and sustain.
The Three Primes shine in alternation,
day and night succeed each other.
The four seasons and Five Phases
are relied upon by all things.
The five grains sustain life,
silk and cotton clothe the body.
Harmonize with music,
restrain with ritual.
The Son of Heaven is majestic,
human relationships flourish.
The Great Dao of Heaven and Earth
is profoundly boundless in merit.
Above, honor father and mother;
below, befriend brothers.
Employ the Dao of Heaven,
and no disasters will arise.
Diligently serve Heaven and Earth,
and you will live long without perishing.
Act contrary to this,
and though you seek far, you will falter.
Poor and lowly,
afflicted by chronic illness and misfortune—
when guilt fills and sins are fixed,
the Executioners will come to restrain you.
Sinking into hell,
forever parting from the human world,
suffering calamities for ten thousand kalpas,
beyond all reckoning.

Let good men and good women
forever renounce evil intentions.

Lord Lao says: This scripture is most noble, the essential means for living beings to repent their transgressions, pray for blessings, and cultivate the truth. It may be recited on the days of one’s original destiny, the Four Seasons, the Eight Festivals, the Six Fasts, the Ten Straight Days, or when averting drought or flood, praying for the five grains, seeking blessings and protection, repenting transgressions to dispel misfortune, or breaking curses. According to one’s wishes, with sincere devotion, invite one, two, three, five, or seven Orthodox Unity or Three Caverns masters to build merit by reciting this scripture, performing purification rites, and practicing the Dao. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dispelling all misfortune.

Or, during the three spring months when Heaven and Earth bring forth life, or in autumn and winter when the myriad things mature, burn incense and make offerings, reciting this scripture to bear the merit of the Great Dao’s life-giving work in Heaven and Earth. Heaven hears the humble, the Dao responds to sincerity. Record these earnest prayers, and all will be granted blessings and good fortune. Its profound principles are subtle, its majesty and grace unfathomable. Revere it! Revere it!

When performing the Heavenly Lord’s purification rites, one must fast and purify, abstain from meat and pungent foods, sweep and cleanse the dwelling. All matters must be pure and pristine. The Great Dao of Heaven and Earth observes and records sincerity. Strictly avoid using common objects, as well as items touched by mourners, pregnant women, chickens, dogs, monks, or nuns—anything impure—lest it offend the true and great Dao of Heaven. Heaven and Earth reward and punish without partiality; their responses to reverence or disrespect are irresistible.

For all purification rites and offerings, every item must be abundant. Even slight negligence will cause the Celestial Emperor to refuse them, turning blessings into misfortune. Let all men and women revere this with utmost care.

This is the Heavenly Lord’s incantation to subdue evil spirits. If faithful devotees of the Dao—good men and women—wish to practice divination, they must first burn incense, bow in reverence, and silently invoke the Three Clarities, the Perfected of Highest Heaven, the Celestial Emperors, the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Incense Officers of the Day, and the local earth deities. Then, knock the teeth three times, recite the incantation seven times, and naturally the spirits will respond, the Celestial Perfected will protect, all evil will be averted, and all sins will be erased.

After the Most High had expounded the scripture, the Perfected Lord Yin Xi and the attendant immortals all bowed in reverence and, prostrating themselves again, diligently vowed to uphold it.

Thus concludes the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Lord for Dispelling Demons and Protecting the State*, Scroll the Lower.
