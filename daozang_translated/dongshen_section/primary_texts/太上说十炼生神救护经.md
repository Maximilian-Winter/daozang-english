**The Supreme Lord’s Scripture on the Ten Refinements for Generating the Divine and Delivering Salvation**

At that time, the Supreme Lord Lao Jun divided his form and transformed his appearance, traversing the ten directions to propagate and elevate the teachings of the Dao, delivering salvation to both the living and the deceased. Adapting to the imperial eras, he served as their guiding master, instructing all beings to constantly recite the names of the Heavenly Worthies:

The Heavenly Worthy of Compassion and Salvation from Suffering of the Eastern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Cherishing Life and Salvation from Suffering of the Southern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Impartiality and Salvation from Suffering of the Western Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Great Mercy and Salvation from Suffering of the Northern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Universal Salvation from Suffering of the Northeastern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Salvation from Suffering of the Southeastern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Equal Contemplation and Salvation from Suffering of the Southwestern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Benevolent Transformation and Salvation from Suffering of the Northwestern Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Pervasive Mercy and Salvation from Suffering of the Upper Direction,
The Heavenly Worthy of Vast Deliverance and Salvation from Suffering of the Lower Direction.

The Lord Lao said: "Receive my instructions and reverently recite the names of the Ten Directional Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from Suffering. This can redeem and liberate suffering souls, enabling them to awaken and attain liberation.

You, the fourfold assembly of beings, possess the three karmic actions and six sense faculties. You commit killing, theft, sexual misconduct, greed, anger, jealousy, ignorance, delusion, false speech, frivolous talk, harsh words, divisive speech, curses, and slander. You defy heaven and earth, lack filial piety and righteousness, and are devoid of benevolence and integrity. Your roots of sin are measureless, thus inviting calamities and misfortunes.

If you uphold this true scripture and its sacred names, all shall attain liberation. Lonely souls and stagnant spirits will be reborn in the heavenly realms, and the dust-like sins and transgressions will be entirely dissolved. Furthermore, if the fourfold assembly of living beings can maintain purity and constantly recite this scripture, all hardships and adversities shall be dispelled. Lifespans will be prolonged, bodies and minds will be at peace, and with reverence, they shall take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies, devoutly believing and practicing."
