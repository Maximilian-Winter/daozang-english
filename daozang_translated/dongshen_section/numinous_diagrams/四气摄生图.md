**The Four Qi Life-Nurturing Chart**

**Scripture Title:** *The Four Qi Life-Nurturing Chart* (also known as *The Four Seasons Life-Nurturing Chart*). Author unknown. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Lingtu* Category.

**Preface to the Four Qi Life-Nurturing Chart**

Those who govern a state take nourishing the people as their foundation; those who cultivate the self take treating illness as their priority. Between heaven and earth, none is more noble than humankind. Thus, among the *Hongfan*’s Five Blessings, the first is longevity—even august Heaven deems it the greatest of all fortunes.

Humans rely on primordial *qi* to assume form, receiving *yin* and *yang* *qi* from heaven and earth alike. The Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers; the Five Peaks and Nine Provinces; grasses, trees, and celestial bodies—all things, when compared and categorized, are abodes of the numinous, each governed by its own principle. Preserve them, and they exist; abandon them, and they vanish. Preserve them, and life endures; abandon them, and death follows.

The *Huangting* states: “The mouth is the heavenly gate of the spirit’s mechanism; the feet are the earthly gate of life’s portal; the hands are the human gate, grasping prosperity and decline.” Heaven and earth contain the numinous, yet all rests within human grasp. If the body is so precious, how can life be taken lightly?

The *Qi Jue* further declares: “My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s.” Those who misuse it perish; those who master it endure. It also says: “When essence is refined, clarity arises; when spirit is refined, numinosity arises; when *qi* is refined, purity arises; when the primordial is refined, mystery arises.” Through *qi*, one declines; through *qi*, one flourishes; through *qi*, one perishes; through *qi*, one is born. There has never been form without *qi*, nor *qi* without form. Form and *qi* depend on each other, and their completeness lies in cultivation.

*Laozi* says: “The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth. Subtly, it seems to exist; its use is inexhaustible.” The human mouth and nose are the doors and windows through which the numinous enters and exits. The spirit relies on form, form relies on *qi*, and *qi* relies on blood. Blood and *qi* follow each other like fish in water. When water is turbid, fish grow weary; when *qi* is obstructed, illness arises. Thus, *qi* must be kept clear, blood must circulate, and with unceasing flow, rest and diet aligned with the seasons, the five viscera remain harmonious—how then could illness arise?

If even one viscus loses its harmony, the Triple Burner is assailed by evil, primordial *qi* fails to nourish, and a host of ailments arise together. Confucius said: “Irregular rest and diet, immoderate desires, and excessive labor or leisure—these, along with illness, will destroy you.”

Moreover, when spring winds arrive, grasses and trees burst forth in bud, yet the grain stored in bitter cold does not sprout. When autumn’s frost and rain descend, grasses and trees wither, yet those sheltered by cover remain unharmed. If even the nature of grasses and trees is thus, how much more so the five viscera and six bowels of the human body—do they not depend on cultivation?

Yet the world’s people, unable to practice cultivation, perish one after another, mistaking death for the end of life, attributing illness and debility to the decline of sinews, and believing the union of heaven and earth to be inevitable, never trusting that longevity can be preserved.

Heaven nourishes humans with the Five *Qi*; earth nourishes humans with the Five Flavors. Those who drink the Five *Qi* return to heaven; those who consume the Five Flavors return to earth. Most illnesses arise from improper diet, and the harm of diet surpasses even that of sensual indulgence. Sensual pleasures can be abstained from for years, but diet cannot be abandoned for a single day. Though it offers great benefit, it also brings great harm—like water that both floats and capsizes a boat.

Nurturing life through the four seasons depends on moderation. The *Baosheng Rong* states: “Sour flavors harm the sinews; excessive acridity injures the upright *qi*; sweet things do not benefit the flesh; excessive bitterness harms the will; excessive alcohol shortens life—one must not indulge in partiality or craving. Overthinking harms the nature; joy and anger injure the spirit. When the nature is harmed, life is endangered; when the spirit is injured, life is encroached upon. Nurture the nature to preserve *qi*; guard the spirit to calm the mind. If one exhausts the mind in pursuit of things, wearies the body externally, and drains the essence internally, a multitude of evils will arise—how then can longevity be attained?”

The spirit follows *qi*, and *qi* depends on flavor. When flavors are harmonious, primordial *qi* is clear; when primordial *qi* is clear, the spirit is bright; when the spirit is bright, there is no illness. Thus, the body should be kept in constant, moderate motion, and food should be kept in moderation. Do not overtax labor, nor let hunger become extreme.

From the Spring Equinox to the Summer Solstice, consume fewer dairy and sweet foods, as they conflict with raw and cooked dishes. From the Summer Solstice to the Autumn Equinox, eat fewer baked and fried foods, as they conflict with melons. Though illness may not arise immediately, it will eventually manifest as various acute conditions—this is the principle of returning to the root.

Excessive clothing and thick bedding weaken the body, leading to wind-cold illnesses. Beautiful, alluring concubines lead to depletion and emaciation. Overindulgence in rich flavors, forced eating when sated, and excessive drinking lead to hernial and obstructive illnesses.

The Way of nurturing life: avoid prolonged walking, sitting, listening, or gazing; do not force eating or drinking. Worry, sorrow, hunger, and thirst—let daily pursuits be ceaselessly moderate. Thus it is said: “Flowing water does not stagnate; a door hinge does not rot—because they are in constant motion.”

To guide and pull *qi*, one need not perform phoenix flights or monkey leaps, tiger crouches or ape bounds. Simply stretch the four limbs, move the nine orifices, and let blood and *qi* circulate, ascending and descending in free flow. The *Zhenqi Ming* states: “To eliminate illness, guiding and pulling come first. When meridians are unobstructed, joints are at ease.” Sometimes, like drawing a bow to shoot a hawk, bend the body sideways in a curve; sometimes, arch the spine like a half-moon toad. Interlace fingers behind the head, rotating left and right; stretch the limbs fully, letting *qi* flow from the fingertips. Swing the four limbs, grasp and expand the Three Passes. Rub until warm and red, and do the same for the *Qihai*. Thus, with proper nurturing, one’s years may equal those of the tortoise and crane; with reckless indulgence, one’s life may be as brief as the clam or mayfly.

From youth, I admired the Daoist gate and dwelled in simplicity, exploring the profound subtleties of the *Huangting* and plumbing the mysteries of the *Five Thousand Characters*. Now, I have gathered medical texts, collected secret methods, and recorded the taboos and practices of the four seasons for a year’s cultivation, placing them by my seat.

Here follows the *Four Seasons Nurturing Life Chart*.

**Four Seasons Nurturing Life Chart**

**Spring: The Liver Reigns**
The liver belongs to the Wood of the East, governed by the Azure Emperor Spirit, its form like the Green Dragon, its likeness like a hanging gourd. The liver is called *gan* (trunk), for its shape resembles branches and stems—hence the name. It weighs four *jin* and four *liang*, situated below the heart, with seven lobes: three on the left, four on the right. The liver is the mother of the heart and the child of the kidneys.

Beneath the liver dwell the Three Hun—Souls: *Shuangling* (Luminous Clarity), *Taiguang* (Womb Light), and *Youjing* (Hidden Essence). At nightfall and in ordinary times, knock the teeth thirty-six times to summon the liver spirit and the spirits of the Three Hun. The eyes are its palace: the left eye is *jia*, symbolizing the sun and belonging to *yang*; the right eye is *yi*, symbolizing the moon and belonging to *yin*. When the liver releases fluid, it becomes tears; if kidney *qi* invades the liver, one weeps excessively. The gallbladder is its paired *fu*-organ, attached to the liver beneath its short lobe.

The *Huangting Jing* states:
*The liver’s qi surges, clear and long,
Arraying the six fu to birth the Three Lights.
Heart’s essence and intent focus inward, unwavering,
Above uniting with the Triple Burner, below with Jade Nectar.*

Its sound is *jiao*, its nature benevolence, its flavor sour, its odor rank. If heart *qi* invades the liver, one loathes rank odors. Its creature is the scaled; all scaled beings belong to the East. The liver spirit delights in benevolence and compassion—grief and lamentation arise from the liver. When the liver spirit is joyful, illness does not arise; when it hears sorrow, tears flow—tears issue from the liver.

In the three months of spring, Wood flourishes: Heaven and Earth’s *qi* quickens, and the myriad things flourish. To pacify its spirit, one should bestow kindness upon all creatures, let mercy extend to all beings, neither drain rivers nor marshes nor empty ponds, so as to nurture sprouts and cease harm and killing. Thus one harmonizes with the Great Clarity, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s generative *qi*. Sleep early and rise early, thereby attaining the Dao. If one opposes this, the hair and bones will not flourish; Metal *qi* will overcome Wood, and manifold illnesses will arise. Such afflictions are difficult to cure, becoming the scourge of spring and summer.

The liver spirit is named *Longyan*, styled *Hanning*. The liver’s form is green in color, its shape resembling a suspended gourd, and its spirit like a dragon.

The liver connects to the interstices above and governs the eyes—when the liver is in excess, the eyes turn red. It also governs the sinews: when the sinews are tense, the liver is deficient. When the skin is withered, the liver is hot. When the flesh and bones bear speckles, it is liver wind. When the complexion is green, the liver is in excess. When one craves sour flavors, the liver is insufficient. When the hair is withered, the liver is injured. If lung evil invades the liver, one laughs excessively. When the hands and feet sweat profusely, the liver is free of illness. If liver *qi* rebels, there is headache, ringing in the ears, drowsiness, slight pain in the lower abdomen, and blurred vision with floating specks.

For men over fifty, kidney *qi* declines and no longer responds to the liver, which is why the eyes dim. If care is improper, the eyes redden and itch. When the liver is assailed by yin evil, one dreams of gardens, bamboo groves, or verdant landscapes, or of being near water, seeing dragons, snakes, birds, and beasts running in alarm. This may be dispelled with the *xu* breath.

At dawn, knock the teeth nine times, draw in pure *qi* through the nose, and gently exhale *xu* thirty-six times to treat all liver vexations and heat.

**Spring Taboos and Observances:**
- **First Month:** Do not eat raw scallions, knotweed seeds, garlic, leopard cat, or leopard meat. Eating chives fortifies the viscera.
  - **Day 1:** Observe the *Xushou* Fast.
  - **Day 4:** Do not kill living beings.
  - **Day 7:** The Triple Assembly Day—observe the *Yanshen* Fast.
  - **Day 8:** Auspicious for bathing.
- **Second Month:** Do not eat knotweed seeds, parrot eggs, or rabbit meat.

  - **Day 3:** Observe the *Dangxie* Fast; do not eat any of the five viscera or the hearts of herbs.
  - **Day 6:** Auspicious for bathing.

When traveling in spring, do not drink from deep springs or flowing water. Wait for the sound of thunder before changing sleeping quarters.

During the seventy-two days of spring, reduce sour flavors and increase sweet flavors to assist the spleen spirit.

**Liver Ailments:**
When the liver is diseased, the eyes redden, and growths, nebulae, or films appear, obscuring vision. The *Waima Sanzi* powder is recommended:
- *Shengma* (8 *fen*)
- *Huangqin* (8 *fen*)
- *Shanzhi* (7 *fen*)
- *Huanggua* (7 *fen*)
- *Wangmingzi* (10 *fen*)
- *Cheqianzi* (10 *fen*)
- *Ganjiang* (10 *fen*)
- *Difuzi* (10 *fen*)
- *Longdan* (5 *fen*)
- *Chongweizi* (5 *fen*)

Roast the ingredients, grind into powder, and administer.

Take on an empty stomach, mixed with three *qianbi* of water, once daily.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Remedy for the Five Taxations and Seven Injuries in Men:**
When yang declines and withers, the scrotum develops sores; there is pain in the lower back and spine, with inability to bend or stretch; the sinews and vessels become numb and cold; sometimes there is feverish itching, sometimes swelling that makes walking difficult; wind-induced eruptions appear; distant vision blurs; coughing and counterflow qi arise; the body becomes emaciated and sallow; qi surges to cause umbilical pain; the bladder tightens and spasms; blood appears in the urine; the penis and testicles ache, or there is dribbling, staining the undergarments red or yellow; or there are nightmares and fright; dry mouth and stiff tongue—all these stem from the seven injuries, leading to taxation and exhaustion. This remedy governs such conditions, proving most efficacious and wondrous.

**Modifications:**
- For indigestion, increase *fuling* by one-third.
- For ear afflictions, increase *changpu* by one-third.
- For heat and thirst, increase *kulou* by one-third.
- For bodily itching due to dampness, increase *shanzhuyu* by one-third.
- For impotence, increase *tusizi* by one-third.
- For lumbar pain, increase *niuxi* by one-third.
- For blurred vision, increase *xixin* by one-third.
- For sores, increase *xuduan* by one-third.
- For impotence, increase *bajitian* by one-third.
- For wind evil, increase *fangfeng* by one-third.
- For damp itching of the genitals, increase *shanyao* by one-third.
- For wind itching, increase *tianxiong* by one-third.
- For shortness of breath, increase *shejiangzi* by one-third.
- For lack of strength, increase *baiziren* by one-third.
- For fright and restlessness, increase *yuanzhi* by one-third.
- For bodily skin pain, increase *shihu* by one-third.
- For unbearable intestinal pain, increase *duzhong* by one-third.
- For impotence, increase *roucong* by one-third.

**Ingredients:**
Eighteen ingredients, each in the amount of four *fen*. Roast, then grind into powder, and form into honeyed pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Begin by taking three pills, gradually increasing the dosage as tolerated. Alternatively, the powder may be mixed with porridge, taking one *fangcunbi* three times daily. Effects will be felt in seven days, recovery in ten, and full restoration of bodily qi in thirty. Long-term use preserves youthfulness.

**The Heart Governs in Summer.**

The heart belongs to the south, to the element of fire, and is the spirit of the Vermilion Emperor. Its form resembles the Vermilion Bird, its image like an inverted lotus. The heart is *fine*—whatever is subtle and minute, it receives and infuses without fail, transforming water into blood. It weighs twelve taels and contains seven apertures and three hairs. Those of superior wisdom have hearts with luminous cavities—seven apertures. Those of middling wisdom have hearts where qi flows—five apertures. Those of lesser wisdom have qi that is bright yet obstructed, their hearts devoid of apertures, lacking wisdom and prone to deceit.

The heart is the child of the liver and the mother of the spleen. The tongue is its palace gate, its orifice connected to the ears. The left ear corresponds to *bing*, the right to *ding*. Its fluid is sweat; when kidney qi invades the heart, sweating becomes profuse. Its flavor is bitter—all the bitterness of human sorrow and regret arises from the heart. The small intestine is the heart’s mansion, paired with it.

The *Yellow Court Classic* states:
*"The heart’s palace holds a lotus in bloom,
Beneath dwells the youthful Dan Yuan’s home.
It governs the harmony of cold and heat, the balance of nourishment and defense,
Adorned in cinnabar brocade, draped in jade gauze."*

Its sound is *zhi*, its scent scorched—when people speak of "heart-fire," it is this. Such is the decree of heaven. Its nature is propriety, its emotion joy, its creature winged—all feathered beings belong to the south. Its spirit is restless and unsteady; human impatience and rashness arise from the heart.

During the three months of summer, fire reigns, and the ten thousand things ripen. To pacify the heart’s spirit, one must embrace loyalty and fulfill filial piety, uphold righteousness and cultivate benevolence, stabilize its fire, quell its fervor, clarify the heart, harmonize the spirit, abstain from excess in sound and sensuality, and moderate rich flavors. Thus may one dwell in lofty clarity, gaze into the distance, and afterward align with the mean, attuning to the qi of heaven and earth. Rise early, do not weary of the sun, follow the true yang to dispel summer heat—otherwise, the kidney’s store will vie for dominance, and water and fire will clash.

The heart’s spirit is named *Dan Yuan*, styled *Guardian of the Numinous*. The heart’s form is crimson, its image like a lotus, its spirit like the Vermilion Bird. It pairs with the small intestine, governs the blood and vessels, and rules the tongue. When the tongue cannot discern taste, the heart is deficient. When blood surges, the heart is startled. When forgetfulness is frequent, the spirit has departed the heart. When sorrow is abundant, the heart is wounded. When speech is heavy with melancholy, the heart is disordered. When the complexion is green-black, the heart is frozen. When bitter flavors are craved, the heart is insufficient. When the countenance is ruddy, the heart is free of illness.

If the heart is afflicted, the mouth becomes dry, the tongue stiff, the throat sore, and sores appear in the mouth. The heart pairs with the small intestine, governs the blood and vessels, and also rules the tongue—thus those struck by wind often suffer from heart-related tongue stiffness. When the heart is diseased, cold arrives untimely, the ethereal and corporeal souls are unsettled, urine is often red, the lips change color, strength wanes, speech and laughter are untimely, and dreams feature furnaces, cold objects, red garments, naked figures, blood and light, wolves and dogs in pursuit, or the self in peril, encountering weapons and armor. To treat this, use the *he* exhalation.

At dawn, sit upright, click the teeth nine times, inhale pure qi through the nose once, and exhale gently with *he* thirty-six times—overwork harms the heart!

**Summer Taboos and Observances:**
- **Fourth Month:** Consume shepherd’s purse with crucian carp as a broth to stimulate the appetite and replenish. The fourth day is auspicious for bathing. On the eighth day, commence the summer retreat; do not cut any grasses or trees, and avoid eating *hui* fish and garlic.
- **Fifth Month:** Do not eat leeks; consume barley, apricots, and dates, all of which are beneficial. Reduce salty flavors to calm the heart. The first day is auspicious for bathing. On the fifth day, observe the *Continuing Life Retreat*; do not eat raw vegetables. For three days before and after the summer solstice, sleep separately—this month, yin and yang contend, blood and qi scatter; avoid seeing blood or filth. After the summer solstice, do not eat crow, river deer, or sheep’s trotters.
- **Sixth Month:** On the sixth day, observe the *Clearing Summer Heat Retreat*; do not eat mallow, and avoid digging earth. The ninth day is auspicious for bathing.
- **Three Fu Days:** [Text incomplete]

Take the *Kidney Decoction*. For the seventy-two days of summer, reduce bitter flavors and increase pungent flavors to assist lung qi.

If the heart is afflicted, one will dream of red furnaces and raging fires, suffer forgetfulness and frequent fright—take the *Five Ginsengs Pill*:
- *Xuanshen* (7 fen)
- *Danshen* (7 fen)
- *Kushen* (7 fen)
- *Qin jiao* (7 fen)
- *Shashen* (5 fen)
- *Renshen* (5 fen)
- Dried ginger (5 fen)

Grind the ingredients into powder after roasting, refine with honey into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty pills with water decocted before meals.

To supplement kidney qi, take the *Kidney Decoction Pill*:
- One sheep kidney (remove fat and membrane; pig kidney may substitute)
- *Fuling*
- *Shaoyao*
- *Xuanshen*
- Fresh ginger
- *Dihuang* (each 4 *zhu*)
- *Renshen*
- *Gancao*
- *Zexie*
- *Wuweizi*
- *Fangfeng*
- *Cangzhu*
- *Danggui*
- *Huangqi* (each 3 fen)
- *Gui* (2 *zhu*)
- *Digupi*
- *Cishi* (each 5 *zhu*)

Pound into a boiled powder. First, slice one kidney into four or five pieces, then decoct with one *ge* of rice, a piece of ginger, and one stalk of scallion in three bowls of water until two bowls of liquid remain. Remove the kidney and rice, add the medicinal powder, and decoct until one and a half cups remain. Divide into two doses. Take on an empty stomach, then eat porridge cooked with rice and kidney.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"What medicine should one take during the three months of summer?"*
The Woman replied: *"Take the *Poria and Kidney-Supplementing Pill*, which treats internal depletion in men, inability to eat, absentmindedness, forgetfulness, sorrow, joy, and anger without restraint, bodily swelling, dark yellow urine, painful dribbling of essence, cold pain in the bladder, thirst, abdominal distension and fullness—all symptoms of the Seven Damages. This formula is appropriate."*

- For indigestion, double the *fuling*
- For lumbar pain, double the *duzhong*
- For wind afflictions, add one fen of *fuzi*
- For damp itching, add one-third more *shanzhuyu*
- For wandering wind in the abdomen, add one-third more *mudanpi*
- For water qi, add one-third more *zexie*
- For pallor, add one-third more *gui*
- For head wind, double the *shanyao*
- In autumn and winter, add half more *dried dihuang*
- For blurred vision, add one-third more *xixin*
- For yin damp itching, add one fen of *shihu*
- For bodily weakness and jaundice, double the *roucongrong*
- For generalized pain, double the fresh ginger (4 *liang*)

Of these thirteen ingredients, roast and grind all except *gui* into powder, then refine with honey into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take seven pills initially, then twice daily. Abstain from sexual activity and avoid cold, raw fish, and the like.

The lung governs in autumn. The lung pertains to the Metal of the West, presided over by the White Emperor Spirit, its form resembling a white beast, its image like a suspended sounding stone. It serves as the canopy of the five viscera.

The lung is so named for its *xiao* (效), meaning its qi is constrained and pent-up. It weighs three jin and three liang, with six lobes and two ears, totaling eight lobes. The lung is the child of the spleen and the mother of the kidney.

Beneath the lung reside the seven *po* souls, like infants, named Corpse Dog, Crouching Arrow, Sparrow Yin, Swallowing Thief, Non-Poison, Expelling Filth, and Foul Lung. At midnight and dawn, knock the teeth thirty-six times, intone the name of the lung spirit and the seven *po* souls to pacify the spirits of the five viscera. The nose is its palace: the left nostril is *geng*, the right *xin*. In qi, it manifests as cough; in fluid, as nasal mucus. Above, its qi ascends to the brain’s gate; below, it descends to the spleen. Thus, all qi belongs to the lung.

Prolonged exposure harms the lung, for the lung is the root of breath and the palace of transmission. When kidney evil invades the lung, copious nasal mucus results. The large intestine is the lung’s mansion, sharing its glory with the lung. When hair and body hair wither and fall, it signifies lung decline.

*The Yellow Court Classic* states:
*The lung’s palace resembles a flowery canopy,
Beneath it, a youth sits in jade towers.
The child of the seven primals governs qi’s regulation,
Externally corresponding to the Central Peak, the nose’s aligned position.*

Its sound is *shang*, its flavor pungent, its odor rank. When heart evil enters the lung, one loathes rank odors. Its nature is righteousness, its emotion anger, its secretion spittle—lung taxation yields excess spittle.

In autumn’s three months, Metal reigns, governing execution; the myriad things wither and diminish. To pacify the *po* and preserve form, one must embrace benevolence and nurture all beings, bestowing kindness and restraining countenance. As yin and yang divide form, the myriad things are reaped and slain. Sparrows sleep, owls rise; after the autumnal equinox, executions must leave no guilt unpunished. Thus, one follows the injury of yin qi to strengthen the lung’s firmness. Following this, evil qi does not invade; opposing it, the five viscera fall into discord.

The lung spirit is named Haohua, styled Xucheng. The lung’s appearance is white, its image a suspended sounding stone, its spirit like a white beast. The lung pairs with the large intestine, its external form manifesting in the nose—lung wind causes nasal congestion. A withered complexion signifies lung dryness; nasal itching, lung worms. Excessive fear indicates the *po* has departed the lung. Black and white spots on the body signify minor lung affliction; frequent vocalizations, lung strength. Intolerance of cold signifies lung decay; a preference for pungent flavors, lung insufficiency. Large intestine constipation signifies lung congestion. A fresh, white complexion signifies a healthy lung.

When the lung is diseased, coughing, rising qi, facial swelling, excessive sleep, facial sores, yellow-white complexion, nasal cold, brain pain, chest and back fullness and pain, limb vexation, skin itching, throat constriction, and dreams of silk and brocade, gold and jade, beautiful women, armored attire, banners, flowers, clouds, cranes, sun, moon, and nobility may occur. To dispel these, use swallowing: at dawn, knock the teeth nine times, gently inhale clear qi through the nose, and swallow lightly thirty-six times to expel the lung’s heat and all evil qi—excess also harms.

**Days to avoid in autumn:** bathing, fasting, and purification rituals.
**In the seventh month:** do not consume ginger or raw honey.

On the fifth day, bathing is auspicious. On the seventh day, being the Triple Assembly Day, perform the Autumn-Welcoming Purification Ritual. On the first day of the eighth month, perform the Evil-Dispelling Purification Ritual. On the fourth day, strictly avoid purchasing footwear or items that attach to the feet, and do not consume parrot meat. On the twenty-first day, bathing is auspicious. On the ninth day of the ninth month, do not move or disturb forest mats; perform the Longevity-Extending Purification Ritual. During the seventy-two days of autumn, reduce pungent flavors and increase sour flavors to assist the liver.

**Daily Regimen:**
Hair should be frequently combed, teeth frequently knocked, saliva frequently swallowed, qi frequently clarified, feet vigorously walked, hands often placed on the face, ears frequently pressed, and eyes frequently rubbed—this is the method of cultivating the Kunlun to attain immortality.

**For lung disease manifesting as skin sores, scabies, consumption, rising qi, coughing, or thickened, dry nasal mucus and saliva, take the Wind-Dispersing Powder:**
- Ginseng (ren shen)
- Salvia (dan shen), each one *fen*
- Ledebouriella (fang feng)
- Processed aconite (tian xiong, prepared)
- Notopterygium (qiang huo)
- Gentiana (qin jiao)
- Cornelian cherry (shan zhu yu), each eight *fen*
- Glehnia (sha shen), five *fen*
- Tiger bone (hu gu, roasted), each ten *fen*
- Dioscorea (shan yao), ten *fen*
- Gastrodia (tian ma), twelve *fen*

The above eleven ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and taken by mixing five *qianbi* with liquid before meals; they may also be formed into pills. The Yellow Emperor asked: "What about the three months of autumn?" The woman replied: "To tonify the kidneys, take the Poria and Aconite Pill, which governs kidney deficiency with cold, internal damage to the five viscera, and the sufferings of wind-cold deficiency. It causes the body and limbs to itch with dampness, the feet to lose their step, unawareness of oneself, loss of taste in food, blurred vision, generalized stiffness, lumbar and spinal pain, inability to eat, daily emaciation, heart palpitations, coughing with counterflow qi, inability to turn over, and the need for support when rising. Acupuncture and moxibustion offer little relief. Alternatively, one may have been exposed to wind while riding, failed to protect oneself, eaten irregularly, overexerted, or suffered from dry mouth, spontaneous drooling, nightmares with involuntary seminal emission, dripping bloody urine, damp itching of the genitals, or fright-like palpitations with unilateral tension in the lower abdomen, aching limbs, wheezing breath, floating swelling of the body and limbs, qi surging into the chest and rib-sides. When physicians fail to recognize this and treat it recklessly, this formula governs it."

**Poria and Aconite Pill:**
- Poria (fu ling)
- Ledebouriella (fang feng)
- Asarum (xi xin)
- Dioscorea (shan yao)
- Alisma (ze xie)
- Aconite (fu zi)
- Aster (zi wan)
- Angelica pubescens (du huo)
- Peony (shao yao)
- Salvia (dan shen)
- Sophora flavescens (ku shen)
- Cinnamon bark (gui xin)
- Dried ginger (gan jiang)
- Achyranthes (niu xi)
- Cornelian cherry (shan zhu yu)
- Astragalus (huang qi), each three *liang*

The above ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and formed into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take seven pills before meals, twice daily.

**The Kidneys Govern Winter**
The kidney viscera belong to the north, the water phase, and the Black Emperor spirit. Their form resembles a deer with two heads, like a round stone. The kidneys’ function is to distribute water and qi, irrigating the entire body like the roots of a tree. There are left and right kidneys, also called the Gate of Life. They are the palace of generative qi and the abode of dying qi. Guard them and they endure; use them and they deplete. They weigh one *jin* and one *liang*, positioned opposite the navel and attached to the lumbar spine. The kidneys are the mother of the liver and the child of the lungs. The ears are their palace.

Heaven gives birth to me, flowing qi transforming—this is called essence. The coming and going of essence-qi is called spirit. Spirit is the kidneys’ repository of intelligence and emotion. The left kidney is *ren*, the right kidney *gui*. In qi, they correspond to *chui*; in fluids, to saliva; in form, to bone. Prolonged standing harms the bones, thus damaging the kidneys. The kidneys pair with bone and correspond to the teeth. Tooth pain indicates kidney damage. They govern the upper burner, nourish the middle burner, and defend the lower burner. When kidney evil enters, there is excessive spittle. The bladder is their palace. Their glory is the hair.

The *Yellow Court Classic* states: "The kidney department’s palace is the dark gate, round. Within dwells a youth named Supreme Mystery. He governs the six palaces and the source of the nine fluids. Externally, he responds to the two ears and the hundred fluid channels." Their sound is *yu*, their flavor salty, their odor putrid. When heart evil enters the kidneys, one loathes putrid things. Their creature is the armored—all shelled beings belong to water, hence called armored.

In the three months of winter, the qi of heaven and earth closes, and the myriad things lie hidden. Moreover, on the winter solstice, yin and yang contend, and all life is stirred. The noble person fasts, retreats, covers the body, moderates desires, halts music and sex, awaiting the settling of yin and yang. Rising at dawn and retiring at dusk aligns with the sun’s light. Do not contend with the qi of yin and yang, then preserve life, harmonize with the Great Purity, and follow yin and yang. To oppose them injures the internal yin qi, causing kidney viscera to become deficient and disordered. At night, knock the teeth, and at dawn perform thirty-six knocks, calling the spirit’s name to pacify the water viscera.

The kidney spirit is named Dark Obscurity, styled Nurturing Infant. The kidneys’ appearance is black, their form like a round stone, their spirit like a white deer with two heads. The kidneys pair with bone above and govern the teeth. Tooth pain indicates kidney damage. They also govern the ears; deafness indicates kidney deficiency. Bone pain indicates kidney depletion. Frequent gum bleeding indicates kidney cold. Tooth decay indicates kidney wind. Ear pain indicates kidney congestion. Frequent yawning indicates kidney evil. Inability to straighten the waist indicates kidney freezing. A yellow complexion indicates kidney decline. When kidney evil enters, there is frequent groaning. A purple, radiant complexion indicates healthy kidneys. When the kidneys are diseased, there is pain and cold in the lumbar region, knees, and bladder, dripping urine, a black complexion, scorched teeth, heaviness of the body, panting, coughing, night sweats, tinnitus, qi obstruction, inability to eat, and dreams of entering dark places, seeing women, monks, nuns, turtles, soft-shelled turtles, galloping horses, spears, banners, oneself wearing armor and traveling together, or sailing boats or riding horses. Blowing can dispel these.

At dawn, knock the teeth nine times, draw in clear qi through the nose, and lightly blow thirty-six times to expel all kidney evils; excessive blowing also harms.

In the twelfth month of winter, reduce salty flavors and increase bitter flavors to assist the heart viscera. When the kidneys are diseased, there is frequent urination, lumbar and hip pain, and dreams of intercourse with ghosts. Take the **Eight-Ingredient Pill**:

- Poria (fu ling)
- Alisma (ze xie)
- Moutan (mu dan pi), each three *fen*

- Dioscorea (shan yao), each four *fen*

The above ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and formed into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds.

Take thirty pills with wine on an empty stomach; avoid raw radishes.

The Yellow Emperor asked: "What is suitable for the three months of winter?"
The Woman replied: "The **Life-Guarding Poria Pill** governs the five taxations and seven injuries in men, dim and blurred vision with wind-induced tearing, head wind and stiff nape preventing turning, distention and fullness in the heart and abdomen extending upward to the chest and ribs and downward to the waist and back, piercing pain throughout the exterior and interior, panting with inability to eat or drink, coughing with counterflow, withered yellow complexion and eyes, dripping urination, impotence and failure to rise when needed, lack of vigor in the moment, swollen feet and abdominal pain, vexing heat in the five centers, floating swelling of the body and back, night sweats, cramping or slackening of the four limbs, startling dreams and waking in terror, shortness of breath, dry mouth and tongue, symptoms resembling wasting-thirst, sudden joy or anger, sorrow and weeping—this formula governs them.

- Poria (fu ling)
- Dioscorea (shan yao)
- Cinnamon bark (rou gui)
- Fresh cornelian cherry (sheng shan zhu yu)
- Morinda (ba ji)
- Dried ginger (gan jiang)
- White atractylodes (bai zhu)
- Achyranthes (niu xi)
- Cuscuta (tu si zi), each one *liang*
- Asarum (xi xin)
- Ledebouriella (fang feng)
- Alisma (ze xie)
- Biota seed (bai zi ren)
- Moutan (mu dan pi), each half a *liang*
- Aconite (fu zi), one and a half *liang*

The above ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and formed into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take seven pills before meals, twice daily.

**The Spleen Viscera Reigns in the Four Seasons**
The spleen viscera belongs to the central earth, reigning in the four seasons. It is the spirit of the Yellow Emperor, shaped like a phoenix, the *qi* of *kun*, the essence of earth, resembling an overturned basin.

The spleen (*pi*) means "to assist" (*pi*), aiding the stomach *qi*. Located three *cun* below the heart, it weighs one *jin* and three *liang*, three *cun* wide and five *cun* long. The spleen is the child of the heart and the mother of the lungs. Externally, it connects to the space between the eyebrows, governing planning and discernment—all intentions and judgments arise from the spleen. The mouth is its palace. Its spirit is prone to jealousy, which originates in the spleen. The spleen has no fixed form, as it governs earthly *yin*. Jealousy likewise has no standard; women are often jealous because they receive *yin qi*.

Eating soft, well-cooked food is the wondrous Dao for the whole body. The spleen, like a mill, transforms food; undigested food means the spleen is not turning. Hard foods are difficult to digest. If one goes out immediately after eating, the spleen tilts, and tilting prevents digestion, leading to the harm of retained food. For those who labor physically, this may be tolerable, but for those over fifty or those who live in leisure, it becomes a self-inflicted affliction.

When the spleen *qi* is harmonious, the mouth knows the five flavors; when the spleen *qi* is diseased, the lips turn black, the mouth becomes dry, one loses the desire to eat, and the five flavors are unrecognizable. The *Huangting Jing* states: "The spleen, one *chi* long, covers the Great Granary; the Central Palace is governed by the Venerable Lord."

Its sound is *gong*, its nature is trust, its flavor is sweet, and its odor is fragrant. If heart evil enters the spleen, one cannot detect fragrance. Its creature is the naked one, governing swallowing. The spleen arises in the central palace, resides in the left cheek, and governs the lips and mouth. The mouth corresponds to *wu*, the tongue to *ji*, uniting with flesh and flourishing in the lips.

If the viscera are not regulated, the spleen is harmed; if the spleen is not regulated, the substance is harmed. When both substance and spirit are damaged, it injures a person with wind-stroke, causing drooling and stiff tongue—this is the spleen *qi* receiving evil. On the eighteenth day from the end of each season, reduce thoughts and set aside worries, humble oneself to aid others, avoid contending for profit, refrain from hidden malice, do not compete with things, and do not rely on self-strength. Be tranquil, harmonious, clear, and empty, following the virtue of the spirit, and thus preserve life. Going against this causes the spleen and kidneys to receive evil, as earth and wood overcome each other.

**The Spirit of the Spleen**
The spirit of the spleen is named Changzai, styled Huntíng. The spleen’s form is yellow, resembling an overturned basin, and its spirit is like a phoenix. The spleen and stomach together form a *fu*, residing in the left rib, lodging in two palaces and six *qi* ribs, reigning in the four seasons, transforming the raw into the cooked.

Undigested food means the spleen is not turning. Overeating indicates spleen vacuity. Disregarding food means the spleen contains undigested food. Inability to eat means the spleen is blocked. A lack of complexion indicates spleen vacuity. Craving sweet foods indicates spleen insufficiency. Excessive confusion indicates the spleen’s discernment is unsettled. Those with wind or lung disease who eat excessively have spleen vacuity. Lustrous, white, and smooth flesh indicates the spleen is free of disease.

The spleen’s sound governs *gong*, the chief of the five notes, corresponding to the *huangzhong* pitch. When the spleen hears music, it grinds. The spleen is the root of original *qi*. *Gong* resides in the Great Alabaster, its color is yellow, and it is heavy. Earth reigns in the sixth month and is also lodged in the four seasons. Symptoms include bodily heaviness, weakness, loss of appetite, a creeping sensation like wandering wind over the body, self-oppression in the heart, and a withered yellow complexion. Dreams of moving earth, being in wild graves, or seeing Daoists within city walls, accompanied by children, can be dispelled by calling out.

At dawn, click the teeth six times, gently inhale clear *qi* through the nose, and exhale thirty times to dispel the spleen’s stagnation—excessive exhalation also harms.

**The Six Qi Method**
For upper heat, *he* the heart fire; for dim eyes, *xu* cures itself. For lung cold, *yan* is effective; for ear disease, *chui* the heart. For the spleen and stomach, constantly *hu* and *xi*; for triple burner stagnation, *xi*. In the mountains without medicine, this is the good physician.

*Xu*, *he*, *yan*, *chui*, *hu*, and *xi*—these six sounds dispel all diseases of the five viscera. Though many medical texts are erroneous, after examining cultivation and nourishment classics and thoroughly investigating their principles, these six sounds are now established. If the viscera and bowels have disease, simply calm the mind, stabilize the intention, visualize the *qi*, and gently exhale *xu* or *he*—evil *qi* will naturally dissipate. The statement that thirty repetitions are the limit, with excess causing harm, is a general guideline without fixed standard. When the tongue and throat feel clear and cool, the disease has passed.

When the spleen is diseased, *qi* surges upward to the heart, and the four limbs become vacuous and swollen. The **Chebule Pill** is suitable:

- Chebule peel (he li le pi), seven *fen*
- Dioscorea (shan yao)
- Moutan (mu dan pi)
- Alisma (ze xie)
- Cornelian cherry (shan zhu yu)
- Poria (fu ling)
- Long pepper (bi ba)
- Peony (shao yao), each eight *fen*
- Dried ginger (gan jiang), five *fen*

The above ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and formed into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds.

The above ingredients are simmered, pounded into powder, and formed into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take thirty pills on an empty stomach with jujube decoction.

**Gallbladder Viscus**
The gallbladder is the essence of Metal and the *qi* of Water; its color is green. Its spirit-form resembles the tortoise and serpent, and its shape is like a suspended gourd, attached beneath the short lobe of the liver. The gallbladder (*dan*) is so named for *daring* (*gan*), signifying that one’s *qi* is bold and resolute. It weighs three *liang* and three *zhu*, serving as the liver’s *fu*-viscus. Though the gallbladder is not counted among the five viscera, it is classified among the six *fu*-bowels. Yet since the gallbladder below also receives the *qi* of Water and shares the same path as the Kan Palace, it cannot be treated as one of the six *fu*-bowels—thus it is separately established as the gallbladder viscus.

A person’s courage and decisiveness arise from the gallbladder viscus. It is paired with the bladder and governs the hair. *The Yellow Court Classic* states: *"It commands all strength and seizes the tiger’s troops; externally, it corresponds to the pupils of the eyes and the bridge of the nose. Brain and hair support each other, both radiant—this is how the gallbladder section resembles the five viscera."*

Moreover, the gallbladder resides in the Kan Palace, enabling one to admire goodness, discern evil, sever deceit, and halt flattery, desiring to walk the straight Dao. The gallbladder governs Metal, and Metal governs killing—hence it abounds with the *qi* of courage and slaughter. When all things are killed, sorrow arises. Since sorrowful *qi* is Metal born of Water, this is why the eyes shed tears.

The heart governs Fire, and the gallbladder belongs to Water. Fire is extinguished by Water, and Water is boiled by Fire—when Yin and Yang contend at the gate, Water prevails over Fire, and the eyes produce *xiang*-tears, which issue from the gallbladder. The gallbladder’s Water governs the pupils of the eyes, receiving the essence of Wood; the two combine in men.

When the eyes dim at fifty, it is because kidney-*qi* has declined and gallbladder essence has waned—one may supplement the kidneys. The gallbladder is the liver’s senior; to pacify its spirit, one must cease anger and strife, practice benevolence, and uphold righteousness—only then can life be preserved whole.

**Gallbladder Spirit**
Name: *Longyao* (Dragon Radiance)
Style: *Weiming* (Majestic Brightness)

The gallbladder’s form is green in color, its shape like a suspended gourd, and its spirit resembles the tortoise and serpent. It is paired with the bladder and governs the hair above. When the hair withers, it is due to gallbladder depletion.

**Gallbladder Disorders**
When the gallbladder is diseased, one sighs deeply, the mouth becomes dry, and the heart feels unsettled, as if pursued by others—this is *qing* (prostration). When the gallbladder is replete, it is harmed by Heat; Heat causes the spirit to lose its anchor, and one rises and wanders without stability. When the gallbladder is vacuous, it is harmed by Cold; Cold induces fear, dizziness, and an inability to venture out alone.

When the fingernails are dry, the gallbladder is deficient. When one feels no fear, the gallbladder is vast and replete. When tears flow without cause, the gallbladder is vacuous. When one craves bitter foods, the gallbladder is insufficient. When the hair is parched, it is gallbladder Wind. When the hair withers, it is gallbladder Heat. When the complexion is green and lustrous, the gallbladder is free of disease. When one dreams of fighting with others or coupling with ghosts, the gallbladder is debilitated.

To treat gallbladder disorders, use the *xi* exhalation to expel them. At dawn, click the teeth nine times, draw in pure *qi* through the nose, and gently exhale *xi* thirty times to dispel gallbladder disease—excess will cause harm.

The Three Corpses are named Peng Ju, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao. Each night, call their names seven times in succession. Suddenly, one will feel a void chill, and sleep will not come easily. The Corpses will then dissolve in form and wander, no longer able to dwell within the human body.

Moreover, one’s body may thereby mirror the state, and the spirit of the heart will naturally reign as sovereign. As the *Classic* says: “If the lord and king can guard it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.” How then could the Three Corpses do aught against me? Thus, with the body at peace, family and state may be preserved; with the heart settled, life and nature may be preserved whole.

If one indulges in wine and lust, craves rank and meat, the Corpses will undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, following desire to return. All manner of infirmities will arise of themselves, and one will grow distant from the Dao and its sentiments.

**Postscript**

Man observes the qi of yin and yang to form the four great elements of the body. The body is to the self as a state is to the realm: the chest and face correspond to the palace halls, the four limbs to the suburbs and outskirts. The spirit is like the ruler, the blood like the ministers, and the qi like the common folk. If the ruler can transform and reach the common folk, the realm will be at peace; if the body can harmonize blood and qi, the four limbs will flow freely.

Thus, the sage tends to the body before illness arises, cherishing an indestructible lifespan. He follows his nature, expanding and contracting, advancing and retreating as the times demand. Serene and refining the spirit, he acts with reverent caution—this is the foundation.

As the *Classic* says: “If man does not fear majesty, great majesty will come.” If one lacks awe in nurturing life, the heart will grow disordered and difficult to govern, the form restless and unsettled, the spirit scattered and qi dimmed, the will adrift and the mind wayward.

Laozi said: “He who is skilled in nurturing life walks on land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger, enters battle without donning armor or wielding weapons”—this illustrates reverent caution. He also said: “The five tones deafen the ears; the five flavors dull the mouth.” Thus, one should abide in serenity.

The methods of nurturing life are manifold: burning incense and opening scriptures, pacing the void and treading the Dipper, donning tall caps and short robes, consuming cypress and pine, refining mercury and firing elixirs, crafting herbal pills and powders. Though the paths are myriad and cannot all be exhausted, they converge as one, and a hundred thoughts unite in purpose. If one’s devotion is sincere and long-standing, and one’s reverence deepens over the years, will the True Lord not take notice and act in secret?

As the *Book* says: “Heaven observes with clarity, blessing the good and calamitizing the licentious.” Thus, heaven and earth endure forever, and sages and worthies never perish.

Life is the great virtue of heaven and earth; death is their bitter poison. Therefore, brush away the dust from your robes, cast off the bitter poison, still the five viscera, circulate the Three Origins, and open the wondrous scripture of the Yellow Court. Peruse the secret formulas of the Purple Chamber, and thereafter one may preserve or abandon, conceal or reveal, transcend the bounds of transformation, and enter the land of the Great Desert. Without thought, one may see clearly; without wings, one may soar. Play in the halls of radiant clouds, discourse in the chambers of azure mists—longevity may then be hoped for.

As the *Classic* says: “Laozi cultivated himself for one thousand two hundred years, yet his form never declined.” It also says: “When the spirit guards the form, one may attain long life.” The Way of long life is not transmitted to the unworthy. Those who lightly divulge it incur calamity, while those who faithfully heed the celestial offices have their names recorded in the registers of immortals. Blessings and misfortunes extend to the nine ancestors; rise and fall rest with the individual—how could the foolish and common be made to see and hear all?

Since the time of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, the methods of long life of Guangcheng, Red Pine, Lingwei, and Anqi have been clearly known—why then do men remain deluded and fail to return? Some merge with the primordial and natural, their bodies uniting with transformation, their wisdom encompassing the myriad things, their Dao second only to the Three Clarities—these are the august and mysterious perfected ones. Others accumulate merit over countless kalpas, their virtue spreading like dust and sand, their spiritual transformations boundless, soaring and roaming freely—such were Du Chong and Yin Gui. Dwelling in mountains to nurture qi, free of desire and action, guarding the Dao and preserving essence, their hearts as clear as the azure vault—such were Xu You and Chao Fu. Some are recorded in distant bamboo and silk, while others are heard of nearby. The foolish are like the blind and deaf; the wise attain both honor and nobility.

Though Tao Hongjing’s books filled his belly, what did he gain in the end? Though he fasted until his belly was empty, what did he attain? Though his marvelous deeds surpassed his age, what use were they? Though he understood the celestial patterns, what did he truly know?

Laozi said: “Gold and jade fill the hall—who can guard them? Wealth and nobility breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall.” Why not instead refine the finest essence of the numinous terrace and enter the great gate of emptiness and nonbeing? Though heaven and earth crumble, I remain whole; though the myriad forms turn to dust, I endure.

Accumulated goodness brings surplus blessings, preserving the great harmony; accumulated evil destroys the self—what regret can there be? Thus, the Dao does not fail man; it is man who fails the Dao. Can the teachings left by sages and worthies be taken lightly?

Moreover, dwelling in this fleeting world, burdened by a thousand cares and vain adornments, one need not abandon grain or retreat to the mountains, abruptly forsaking the dusty world. Simply nurture life in accord with the seasons, gradually curbing arrogance and extravagance. Do not crave or indulge in the five flavors or the five tones. Know the serenity of the natural, and you will attain the wondrous Way of long life.

Heaven governs yang and movement; earth governs yin and stillness. Though heaven moves, the Northern Asterism does not shift; though earth is still, the eastern currents never cease. Thus, stillness is the heart of heaven, and movement is the qi of earth. When the heart is still and qi moves, the Dao is without fail accomplished, and illness has no means to arise.

Those who study the Dao should broadly practice hidden virtue: with a compassionate heart, save others; value the Dao and disdain wealth; do not begrudge gold and jade; relieve the poor and destitute—this is called the field of blessings. Silently nurture qi, serenely harmonize the spirit, act with goodness and humility, do not deceive or cheat, think little and speak little, desire little and worry little. Do not believe in omens or heresies, do not kill living beings, do not engage in hidden malice, do not crave the five pungent foods, do not share clothing or towels with others, do not contend over right and wrong, do not face north when relieving yourself, do not gaze long at the Three Luminaries. On *liu-jia* days, do not eat scaled creatures; on the last and first days of the lunar month, reflect on cultivating good deeds; on *jia-zi* and *geng-shen* days, sit in quietude in a separate chamber.

Do not sleep in an empty hall with high, open spaces, for not only are wind and mist difficult to guard against, but it also causes the hun and po souls to become disoriented. Do not lie supine when sleeping, nor use a pillow that is too high; do not keep a lamp burning where you sleep. When walking at night, one must beat the "Heavenly Drum." On the eight solar term days, do not issue stern commands, and on the Autumn Equinox, one must especially purify the heart. The divine beings praise thus:

*If you wish to ascend to heaven, be cautious on the Autumn Equinox,
Let no matter, great or small, go unheard.
Seeking immortality through sin is truly difficult,
Knowing this, the heart of the Dao learner grows cold.*

If sleep is restless and the heart is startled and fearful, this means the seven *po* souls are about to scatter and the five spirits are contending, with illness and misfortune soon to strike. One must be vigilant in protection: sit upright morning and evening, click the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*Supreme Emperor of the Nine Heavens, Eight Spirits of the Four Gates,
Seven Chambers and Three Mysteries, Three Pure Ones and Nine Essences,
Great Unity and Peach Prosperity, ascend to the Three Clarities,
Petition the Imperial Lord, summon the Yellow Tranquility to command,
Swiftly call back the seven po souls, verify them in the divine court.
If there is any inauspiciousness, the seven corpse ghosts and soldiers,
Simply invoke the Twin Perfected Ones, refine the form with flowing candles.
Great Spirits of the Grand Tenuity, slay and expel evil essences.
When the three spirits are harmonious and gentle, the blood corpse will sink and vanish,
The spirits will return to their abodes, all obstacles will turn to good fortune,
Granting me immortality as a divine transcendent, preserving my lifespan through the kalpas.*

**Cautions of the Divine Farmer:**
Do not consume millet and mallow together, as it causes *zheng* and *pi* illnesses.

**Cautions of the Divine Farmer (continued):**

Do not consume soybeans with pork, as it causes *yong*-qi illness. Green beans with grasshoppers or carp produce emaciation. Dried meat exposed to summer sun breeds worm-borne diseases. Wheat flour with dog meat causes malignant sores and triggers wind afflictions. Excessive red adzuki beans make one gaunt. Sweet porridge with cocklebur produces *zheng*-qi. Any wine or broth that casts no shadow when held aloft is lethal. Overnight mallow sprouts, when eaten, induce five types of *liu*-*pi* illnesses. Mallow with carp or grasshoppers harms the body. Mustard with rabbit meat causes malignant diseases. Lettuce with yogurt breeds tapeworms. Raw scallions with honey endanger life. Scallions with parrot eggs, pheasant, or white dog meat induce madness and *zheng*-*pi*. Chives with beef produce emaciation. Wild lettuce with honey causes hemorrhoids. Excessive magnolia flowers induce phlegm and drowsiness. Most raw fruits, when eaten in quantity, trigger chronic ailments. Plums with honey and water generate phlegm. Entering water after eating peaches causes *lin* illness. Any fruit stored for days, when consumed, revives old maladies. Fruits that sink in water must not be eaten, as they cause external *pi* illnesses.

In matters of nurturing life, avoid consuming creatures corresponding to your parents’ or your own birth signs, lest your lifespan be shortened. Do not eat meat from animals that died of themselves, as it harms vitality. Meat with cow’s milk breeds intestinal worms. Donkey or horse meat with pork causes cholera. Any organ or flesh resembling water-washed, dust-repellent tissue is highly toxic and must not be eaten. Horse meat with cocklebur or millet harms the body. Mutton with raw leeks or yogurt is injurious. Do not consume food where drifting bees have alighted, as it is poisonous. Meat carved with mulberry branches breeds malignant worm diseases. Sheep’s liver with raw pepper ruptures the heart and liver. Pig’s liver with leeks causes deep abscesses. Rabbit meat with ginger induces cholera. Pork or beef with yogurt produces *qi*-*pi*. Parrot meat with turtle harms the body.

On *ren* and *zi* days, avoid killing any black creatures. On *bing-wu* days, do not eat parrot or similar meats, lest you suffer fire-related calamities. On *geng-shen* and *jia-zi* days, observe abstinence, offering only heartfelt sacrifices to ghosts and gods—no other food. Any meat that remains unreddened when cooked or roasted is harmful. After recovering from acute illness, avoid all meat; until fully restored, refrain from cooked chives and the like.

**Self-Massage Method:**
Press the left hand with the right, the right with the left, upward and downward, forward and backward. Glaring fiercely, clench the teeth, rub the hands until warm, then massage the heels. Pull the ears, twist the waist, shake both shoulders, and reverse the hands’ motion. Next, tug the feet, stretch upward and downward, repeating the sequence seventy to eighty times. Proceed gently, visualizing the Great Harmonious *qi* descending from the void into the crown like clouds entering mountains—penetrating skin, flesh, abdomen, and limbs, moistening the five viscera. When the belly rumbles, focus the mind inward, dismissing external distractions. The primordial *qi* will then reach the *qi*-sea, soon flowing to the *yongquan* points. Perform one to three cycles daily to strengthen vitality, sharpen hearing and sight, dispel all illnesses, and prolong life without limit. After ten million cycles, transcendence is near.
