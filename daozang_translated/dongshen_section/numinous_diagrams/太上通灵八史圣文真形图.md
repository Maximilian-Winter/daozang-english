**The Supreme Peripheral Numinous Eight Historians’ Sacred Text of True Forms**

The Celestial Historian of the August Heaven is named *Lingang* (Approaching Ridge).
The Celestial Historian of the Lofty Heaven is named *Jiangang* (Establishing Ridge).
The Celestial Historian of the Heavenly Thearch is named *Tiangang* (Heavenly Ridge).
The Celestial Historian of the Supreme Thearch is named *Riyuan* (Sun’s Source).

**First Historian:** Husband, *Lingang*; wife, *Zhuxia* (Pillar Below).
Active on *si*, *wu*, and *wei* days, residing in households. Attired in red robes, with divided hems, white brush, and *jinxian* cap.

**Second Historian:** Husband, *Jiangang*; wife, *Xuanjing* (Mysterious Essence).
Active on *shen*, *you*, and *xu* days, residing in households. Attired in white robes, with divided seams, white brush, and *jinxian* cap.

**Third Historian:** Husband, *Tiangang*; wife, *Yuejing* (Moon’s Essence).
Active on *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* days, residing in households. Attired in black robes, with divided hems, white brush, and *jinxian* cap.

**Fourth Historian:** Husband, *Riyuan*; wife, *Taixuan* (Supreme Mystery).
Active on *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* days, residing in households. Attired in green robes, with divided hems, white brush, and *jinxian* cap.

These eight historians’ names are invoked in households on their respective days. When divining by the celestial stems, call their names to inquire, and they will reveal matters. For women seeking answers, invoke the wives’ names.

These historians serve in rotation for nine days, then ascend for three days before resuming, cycling endlessly.

In all matters, the Eight Historians cherish speech; one must not curse or revile them, nor summon them with disrespect. After three years, they may be petitioned. Even when illness is terminal, they may be dispatched to intercede, and life will be preserved.

The Yellow Thearch said: "For a state’s prosperity, cultivate this knowledge. For a scholar’s wealth, invoke this method. The spirits’ power can summon it—treasures and goods will gather like clouds, and all endeavors will be peaceful, securing descendants’ desires."

The Eight Historians pacify the hun-soul and settle the po-soul. Those who seek these spirits will retain dark hair, attain longevity, and maintain purity and radiance. To pursue inner learning, this text may be employed. Thus, the forms of the Eight Historians are recorded.

If one encounters adversity, recite the names of the Eight Historians, and they will reveal matters of fortune or misfortune, near or far. Speak of this to others, even if they cannot serve them.

Merely possessing this text will illuminate one’s mind like the sun and moon.

Those who desire wisdom should perform divination at opportune moments. Once the Eight Historians are invoked, they will reveal hidden affairs, foresee the unforeseen, scrutinize the intricacies of distant matters, and discern fortune or misfortune—though they cannot avert calamity.

For gentlemen seeking minor matters or wealth, have the Eight Historians observe a hundred-day abstention. Summon them on their appointed days without kneeling. If they do not speak, understand in your heart.

The images of the Eight Historians should accompany you. In times of disgrace or defilement, seal them in a vessel; if the chamber is polluted, the spirits will not descend.

It is further said: After a hundred days of purification, summon the Eight Historians. On each historian’s appointed day, invoke their name within the chamber. Place a tray of fruits in the left pivot of the door, along with a cup of wine, and recite:

*"Your descendant [Name] delights in the Dao and its arts. Today, I wish to invoke the Way of the Eight Historians. With reverence, I offer sweet fruits and fine wine as an offering."*

To invoke the Eight Historians, prepare wine and fruits on their respective days, and offer them to two historians. One offering is placed at the threshold, with a small mat draped over the door pivot as a seat. Arrange two trays of dates and chestnuts, along with two cups of wine, before the seat. The Daoist faces the door pivot and, without bowing, declares:

*"Your descendant [Name], who cherishes the Dao and its arts, now purifies and offers sweet fruits, precious dates, fine wine, and fragrant incense. I humbly invite the Eight Historians of the August Heaven—*Lingang* and *Zhuxia*—to partake abundantly, to the point of intoxication and satiety. May [Name] commune with the numinous, attain foresight in divination, perceive hidden affairs, foresee the unforeseen, examine the verifications of distant intricacies, and befriend these spirits, moving and resting with them. From this day forth, let there be responses of sound, light, and shadow—do not be alarmed."*

On subsequent historians’ appointed days, repeat the offering as before. Each invocation must call their names, and each offering will yield verification. If, after years, responses wane, repeat the offering.

These are the talismans of the Eight Trigrams of the August Heavenly Thearchs. Inscribe them on paulownia wood boards, three inches wide and nine inches long, painted red with cinnabar, and written in black ink. After a hundred-day abstention, place them facing the proper direction, and the spirits will descend, bestowing wealth and nobility, resolving legal disputes, silencing slander, attracting wealth, and dispelling misfortune and anomalies. Offer wine to the spirits to witness their efficacy.

The two talismans for *si*, *wu*, and *wei* days reside in households.
The two talismans for *shen*, *you*, and *xu* days reside in households.
The two talismans for *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* days reside in households.
The two talismans for *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* days reside in households.

**The Eight Historians’ Numinous Talisman**

The Yellow Thearch said: "The Mysterious Cavern’s Eight Trigrams Spirit Talisman was concealed by the Supreme Thearch within the *Huagai* (Canopy) and *Taiwei* (Supreme Subtlety) constellations of the Dipper. My former master observed and transcribed it, creating the *Mysterious Cavern’s Mighty Numinous Spirit Talisman of the Dao’s Evolution*. Carrying it into the Hu lands, I used this chart. The Brahmins thereby devised myriad arts of transformation and returned to the Central Plains, acknowledging me as the Dao Lord, recognizing the *Mysterious Cavern* as equal in merit to Heaven.

The spirits’ clarity and scrutiny, their might and verification, the sincerity of their essence, and the virtue of the Dao’s evolution—these are bestowed upon minor omens. Dare one wear them constantly? They were concealed within the *Huagai*, doubly secret.

If a worthy or Daoist whose name has entered the constellations obtains this *Numinous Talisman*, they become a literary immortal."

The noble person, through clarity and understanding, commands the spirits as servants. Should the foolish obtain it, their minds open and they attain rank, sitting to achieve wealth and nobility. As secret as the *Huagai*, they ascend with Master Li.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Qian Talisman*, named *Haocheng*, governs the two constellations of the northwest, presiding beneath the Northern Dipper, the *Taiwei*, and the *Huagai*’s imperial seat, serving as the spirit sovereign of presentation. The pure and refined scholar, whose name has entered the constellations, writes it on a small paper and wears it. The spirit attaches to their person, enabling communion with the numinous, dispelling all illness, sitting or standing at will, moving without obstruction. After three years, they ascend in broad daylight to the stars. Inscribed in cinnabar on white silk and bound to the body’s omens, the Eight Historians attend them, commanding myriad tasks. All illnesses heal spontaneously, and they sit to witness the world’s future events. The foolish and unprincipled must not wear this. Simply conceal and treasure it, and the entire household will be free from harm, attaining clarity, wealth, and high office of its own accord.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Kun Talisman*, named *Jianchong*, serves as the spirit sovereign of the Pillar Historian. It governs the two constellations of the southwest, presiding beneath the Northern Dipper, the *Taiwei*, and the *Huagai*’s seat, used as the Qian method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Zhen Talisman* serves as the spirit sovereign of *Xuanju* and *Jiangang*. It governs the two constellations of the east, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s first star, used as the preceding method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Xun Talisman*, named *Mingyi*, serves as the spirit sovereign of *Xuanjing*. It governs the two constellations of the southeast, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s second star, used as the preceding method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Kan Talisman*, named *Renwang*, serves as the spirit sovereign of *Tiangang*. It governs the north, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s third star, used as the Qian method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Treasure Dao-Evolving Li Talisman*, named *Mingshang*, serves as the spirit sovereign of the moon’s essence. It governs the south, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s fourth star, used as the Qian method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Treasure Dao-Evolving Gen Talisman*, named *Guoyi*, serves as the spirit sovereign of the sun’s origin. It governs the two constellations of the east, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s fifth star, used as the Qian method.

The Yellow Emperor said: The *Huagai Mysterious Cavern’s Numinous Dao-Evolving Dui Talisman*, named *Jianyang*, serves as the spirit sovereign of *Taixuan*. It governs the two constellations of the west, belonging to the Northern Dipper’s sixth star, used as the Qian method.

The Yellow Emperor said: Heaven and Earth each return to their origin; Qian and Kun unite in virtue, governing within the Dipper. The Five Thearchs preside, the *Taiwei* reigns as sovereign. The hexagrams array their measures, the twenty-eight constellations eternally receive their original qi, their movements governed by the mechanism, each returning to govern its respective star’s talisman. They command the Eight Essences, relying on the *Gang* pillar below. Only with this may one proceed.

Descendants who cultivate this become perfected beings. Conceal and treasure it; do not transmit it even for a thousand gold. The Yellow Emperor said: If you would cultivate the Dao, first cultivate the body. Stabilize the hun and po, and guard against reckless speech. Purify yourself for a hundred days, bathing in the *Hua* spring. First sacrifice to the Eight Spirits near the hall’s pivot. Then employ the Eight Talismans, and the Historians will promptly attend. They move and rest with you, serving as your envoys. Wearing the talismans at the eight solar terms, you commune with the imperial stars. White hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow. Following the Historians, you ride dragons, emerging from darkness into light. They dispel disasters and avert harm, manifesting transformations before you. Should you act contrary to the method, do not proceed—heaven’s constellations will hold you accountable.

The Yellow Emperor said: For divination, on yang days (zi), attach the talisman to the left elbow; on yin days (chou), to the right elbow. Visualize the perfected one summoning the Historian to the talisman, pointing to the Eight Historians to invoke them. Matters hidden in the yin, their twists and turns, the Eight Historians all know and will speak of them. You must then deliberate and explain. In divination, guard your words, for the Historians know them. The perfected one ascends to the Dipper’s midst; if the spirits grow angry, they will no longer serve you.

If the querent suffers from illness or official matters, or requires exorcism of disasters, you must, according to the method, return to the Dipper and consult it. Those with destined fortune and virtue should be saved first. Instruct the master to seek a teacher, medicine, or objects in a specific place, and hasten there to obtain them. The Historians will respond immediately, proceeding to the location to await the person or object, or to arrange their acquisition. The Historians act as spirit qi; the sick recover upon seeing the object. If the object startles them, the Historians may manifest as phoenixes to alarm them.

In mountains and forests, whether bright or dim, above or below, if something is obscured, call upon the Historians to inquire, and they will already know and tell you. The Yellow Emperor said: In practicing this Dao, cherish your words and do not recklessly speak of good fortune. When the people encounter inauspicious, evil, or strange calamities, the Historians will respond to your words and seek omens to manifest these misfortunes. If the common folk grow fearful, do not recite the talisman or summon the Historians, lest they grow resentful and bring harm, disasters, or punishments upon people, acting wantonly. With a mind as penetrating as the Dao, you will foresee the future as clearly as the sun and moon. Demons, evil spirits, and slanderous villains dare not act. You will repel weapons, secure office, and attain wealth and nobility without difficulty. This Dao must be kept secret.

The Yellow Emperor said: If you possess the radiant grace to receive the star talismans but cannot cultivate them, store them in a five-colored bag and hang it within your bed’s canopy. If a worthy and enlightened person wishes to cultivate them, follow the above method, placing them in a crimson bag within your robe. Now, the Five Viscera are governed by the Crimson Palace’s Perfected One, *Zidan*, who will constantly befriend you. For exorcising disasters, averting harm, or any matter, wear the talisman as described below.

When wearing the talisman, purify the time and offer a libation to it. Burn incense, place dates, ginseng, and *fuling* tea before the mat, and use yellow silk as a pure path. Bow twice and pray, saying:

Great-grandson, your servant So-and-so, declares: On this clear and bright auspicious day and propitious hour, it is fitting to offer libation to the Eight Trigrams’ Celestial Deities of the Eight Luminaries. With reverence, I present sweet, fragrant chestnuts and dates, and humbly invoke the Eight Lords, the Nine Lords, the Divine Sovereign Fuxi, the Supreme One of the Pillow, the Mighty Offering of the Qian Heavenly Lord and Father, the Illuminated Master of the Dao, and the Perfected One of the Talismanic Way. May the Eight Lords descend and shine their light. May the worthy great-grandson be assisted by the Eight Scribes of the Celestial Offices. Today, the great transformation of Kaiyang unfolds; receive the talisman and embrace the true. Open the path to dispel natural misfortunes and improprieties. Inquire of the matters to come and their auspicious omens; foretell the future. Promote benevolence and righteousness, and boundless blessings shall extend endlessly. Long enjoy good fortune, and the receipt of divination shall never cease.

The Yellow Emperor said: Having made the offering, if you remain unaware that the August Heaven witnesses your sincerity, you should, at midnight, face north and declare: "I traverse Heaven and Earth, my feet tread upon Wenchang, my heart rests in the Great Clarity. Harmonious qi takes form. The Twenty-Eight Constellations hasten directly to the Imperial Court."

Should you grasp the essential secret, the Eight Essences are most true. United in radiance with the celestial deities, they are the foundation of the Eight Scribes. The Heavenly Lords of the Eight Trigrams and the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi—only when you obtain the star talisman will the spirits act. By wearing it, your knowledge increases, and you perceive what has yet to come. First, sacrifice to the Eight Deities, then employ the Eight Talismans. Heaven and Earth unite in fragrance, foreknowing what has not yet manifested and averting calamities already incurred.

At the beginning of the ten-day period, bathe and purify yourself with orchid incense. May the register of death be expunged, and may you don the robe of immortality. Befriend the Scribes, together ascend to the August Star, your body entrusted to the sun and moon, in harmony with the Four Dragons. Long receive good fortune, and may your life be boundless.

The Yellow Emperor said: If you undertake great matters of Heaven and Earth on behalf of others to seek their fate, place the talisman upon your head and fully concentrate on its characters’ meaning. Command the Scribe Jia to mount the Azure Dragon and return to the Dipper, to discern the fortunes or misfortunes of the household of So-and-so. The Scribe will ascend into the Dipper constellation and descend to inform the person of Heaven and Earth’s calamities or blessings, and of the fortunes or misfortunes in their life. Should exorcism be required, bid the Scribe to save them. Pray for longevity, and it shall be granted without fail.

The Yellow Emperor said: If you wish to exorcise disasters, avert harm, and transform misfortune into blessing, first recite the names of the Eight Scribes. Today, on this day of Haocheng, bid them descend and present themselves to exorcise calamities for the household of So-and-so. Whatever is required, the Perfected One shall swiftly dispatch the adamantine courier to hasten and return. Whatever you summon by mouth shall be obtained without fail. Transform misfortune into blessing, but do not kill, nor issue partial commands, lest people rush about in madness, drawn to love only themselves.

If you must issue a command, first remove and set aside the talisman, then command the Scribe at dusk before retiring. The same applies to matters of the bedchamber, lest the woman be shamed.

The Yellow Emperor said: If a woman possesses a love for the Dao, she should be allowed to serve the spirits in accordance with the method.

It is also stated in the *Illustrated Scripture of the Scribes*: "Men serve their husbands, women serve their wives. Husband and wife serve together, as Qian and Kun follow the course of Heaven." Thus, when two are of one mind, their strength can sever metal. When they cultivate goodness together, their benefits run deep. Only then may they mount the Azure Dragon and roam the world with the spirits.

Guard this well, guard it closely. Do not let the unruly Three Women or wicked, deceitful wives practice it. Those who cannot cultivate this will instead bring harm upon you. But if you diligently pursue it, once the Dao is achieved, the spirits will recognize you as a true person, and Heaven will naturally send the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist to you.

The Yellow Emperor said: My former master, Lord Li, sat in the Court of Serene Contention and inscribed the position of the Supreme Micro-Emperor within the Dipper constellation. There, he beheld these Eight Talismanic Scripts and transmitted them to Lesser Omen. As I, Lesser Omen, did not understand their proper sequence, I kowtowed beneath the constellation and made offerings. When I copied the Eight Scribes, they came forth, relying on the spirit of the Eight Scribes and the Eight Trigrams. The talismans of the Eight Trigrams can restrain them, and the Eight Scribes will not bring harm to households.

Every household has Eight Scribes stationed before the central pillar of the hall, and they also stand upright within the Dipper. The Dipper Lord said: "The affairs of the Daoist practitioner require the star talisman to restrain the unruly and punish transgressions." Only by receiving and cultivating the talisman will the spirits act. The prohibition of the Scribe Star Talisman is weighty. Do not transmit it lightly; unless the recipient is a worthy person or a gentleman, be cautious. Do not transmit it for a thousand gold; transmit it only to the worthy. If transmitted to the unworthy, calamity will ensue.

If you find such a person, make the offering as I have described. Follow the method of offering to the talisman, but do not offer beneath the Dipper. If you receive the Dipper Lord’s talisman without knowing this, the Scribe spirits will be startled. If they do not ascend to make their report, the Dipper Lord will hold the person accountable, and both will suffer calamity.

For the offering, arrange the seats of the Five Emperors in the four directions, each seat two *zhang* in length. Use silk according to the method to make mats for the seats. Place three tables in each seat, immaculately clean. Offer seven incense burners, seven lamps, seven bowls of date tea, and seven portions of the five fruits. In the center, arrange one round seat for the Scribe, with one table bearing one incense burner, one lamp, three portions of the five fruits, and a plate of green chestnuts and dates. Place the talisman in the center. On the round seat, arrange five plates of fruit and five incense burners. Invoke the Five Emperors, the Dipper Deities, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Most High Lord Lao, and the Divine Sovereign Fuxi. Then call the names of the Eight Trigrams and the Perfected One of the Talismanic Way. State: "So-and-so, who loves the Dao, has come to seek and request the transmission of the star talisman. Today, it is fitting to transmit it to the worthy and enlightened. Arrange the five-colored seats according to their hues, bright and resplendent. Offer tea, seasonal fruits, and other items with meticulous reverence. Though you may not focus your thoughts, perform the offering beneath the Dipper. Do not invite many people, lest the spirits not descend."

After the offering, transmit the talisman to the worthy one, who shall receive it with a bow. The true shall then be attached to them. First, purify yourself according to the method, and only then may you transmit it. When offering to the talisman or beneath the Dipper, do not call out loudly; simply invoke them in your heart.

Here ends the *Illustrated Scripture of the Sacred Writ and True Forms of the Eight Scribes, Communicating with the Divine*.
