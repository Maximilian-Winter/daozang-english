The Dao takes harmony and equilibrium as its virtue, and its nature is to resolve conflict without opposition. Thus, when Heaven and Earth unite in harmony, the myriad things sprout and flourish, blossoms and fruits ripen. When the state is harmonious, the realm enjoys great peace, and all families live in tranquility. When the household is harmonious, fathers are kind and children filial, and Heaven bestows blessings and felicity.

The wise deeply reflect upon this—how could one not seek harmony?

When Heaven and Earth fall out of harmony, yin and yang lose their balance: winter thunders, summer frosts, floods and droughts disrupt the seasons, the myriad things wither, and blossoms and leaves scorch and perish. When the state is disharmonious, ruler and minister deceive one another, the strong oppress the weak, barbarians invade the borders, weapons clash, the realm is thrown into chaos, and the people cannot live in peace. When the household is disharmonious, fathers lack kindness, children lack filial piety, elders and juniors quarrel, resentment festers, grudges turn venomous, spirits and gods grow disordered, and the family falls into ruin.

The suffering in these two cases all stems from disharmony.

When Heaven and Earth are disharmonious, yin and yang fall into disorder, and calamities befall the myriad things. When the state is disharmonious, the powerful contend for power, prohibitions go unenforced, and harm befalls the people. When the household is disharmonious, disaster arises from greed for wealth and profit, anger and resentment escalate, and misfortune ensues.

Thus, the wise repeatedly explain these truths, fearing that people, long accustomed to unwholesome ways, will personally commit transgressions, incur guilt, fail to awaken, or harbor resentment—thereby deepening their faults. For this reason, they earnestly exhort all to take heed, encourage one another, abandon past evils, and cultivate present goodness.

When goodness accumulates in accord with the Dao, the spirit settles and the body is at ease. Anger does not fester in the heart, harsh words do not pass the lips, foul sounds do not enter the ears, depraved sights do not meet the eyes, and greed and desire do not dominate the mind. By cultivating upright conduct, true *qi* draws near, all evil departs, past transgressions are wholly erased, and new goodness naturally manifests.

Those who wish to uphold the Dao must not be remiss.
In serving the master, one must not be disrespectful.
In serving parents, one must not be unfilial.
In serving the ruler, one must not be disloyal.
In caring for oneself, one must not be negligent.
In heeding teachings and precepts, one must not be disobedient.
Toward like-minded companions, one must not be distant.
In outward conduct, one must not be cunning.
In inner truth, one must not be obscure.
In speech, one must not be careless.
In guarding against misfortune, one must not be unprepared.
The wise must not fail to seek counsel; the foolish must not go untaught.
Benevolence and righteousness must not be neglected.
Kindness and generosity must not be withheld.
The orphaned and weak must not be abandoned.
The poor and lowly must not be left unaided.
Those in distress must not be left undelivered.
Living beings must not be killed or harmed.
Evil deeds must not be committed.
Sensual desires must not be indulged.
Greed for profit must not be pursued.
Wine and meat must not be consumed to excess.
The good must not be disrespected.
The wicked must not go unadmonished.

The wise should deeply ponder these matters.

If one cannot align with the Dharma and precepts, and neither body nor mind possess merit and virtue, then seeking heavenly blessings will be difficult. Cultivating goodness brings fortune; committing evil incurs guilt. When punishment arrives, if one does not reflect upon past transgressions but instead laments that upholding the Dao is futile, blames Heaven, wavers in resolve, turns the mind elsewhere, follows the crowd, succumbs to myriad deceptions, forms cliques, pursues falsehoods, and falls into wickedness—such a person, ignorant and foolish, strays far from the Dao.

The Dao is vast and boundless, without limit. The celestial net is vast and all-encompassing; people dwell within it like fish swimming in a great net, unaware of its presence. When the net is drawn, they are caught; when it is released, they escape. People, unaware of the great spirit of the true Dao, are like fish unaware of the net. Yet some fools abandon truth for falsehood. Though falsehood may yield immediate gains, such gains are short-lived.

Those who betray the Dao are not immediately punished because the great Dao is all-embracing, cherishing human life. It allows people to follow their desires, but though they may initially find satisfaction, they will later regret it deeply—something the foolish cannot comprehend.

The Dao regards people as people regard insects and ants; the Dao can kill as people can kill insects. Yet the Dao loves life and hates killing, and thus does not kill. If the wicked persist in evil, the recording spirits note their transgressions. When sins accumulate and guilt is complete, the executioners will punish them—the Dao itself does not kill.

Those who wish to eliminate harm and halt evil must diligently uphold the teachings and precepts; the precepts must not be violated.

The Dao takes non-action (*wuwei*) as supreme. Human transgressions arise from action, from endless greed for profit. The Dao, being non-active, endures forever. Heaven and Earth follow the Dao’s non-action and merge with it. The perfected emulate Heaven’s non-action and thus attain immortality. Though the Dao is capable of all things, those who cultivate and uphold its teachings and precepts, accumulating goodness, will find their merit and virtue naturally supported. Their bodies will commune with Heaven, and blessings will flow to their descendants.

What the wise delight in, the foolish do not comprehend. Scholars, exert yourselves diligently!

The Celestial Master established teachings and bestowed precepts, upholding the Dao and illuminating its mysteries. Those of superior virtue attain immortality; those of middling virtue double their lifespan; those of lesser virtue extend their years and avoid untimely death.

According to the precepts: those who do evil do not live out their allotted years but die prematurely.

Woe to the wicked!
Why do the wise not cultivate goodness and seek long life and enduring vision?

Though one may not attain middling virtue, by cultivating lesser virtue—governing body and worldly affairs, severing attachments and desires, and reversing the ways of the common world—one may still align with the Dao.

First, one must not indulge in unceasing lust, harbor wayward thoughts, or exhaust the spirit and deplete essence, lest the hun and po souls scatter. Such transgressions bring grievous harm to the self.

Second, one must not succumb to violent rage, venting anger through harsh words, loud curses, or reckless oaths that shake heaven and earth, startling gods and terrifying ghosts. Repeated offenses accumulate resentment within, injuring the five viscera. Once the five viscera are damaged, illness becomes incurable. Moreover, those who uphold the Dao have celestial officials and soldiers within their bodies. Frequent outbursts of wrath cause these spirits to abandon their posts, and the officials ascend to the celestial courts to report one’s transgressions. As offenses accumulate and sins take form, the left tally erases life, while the right tally inscribes death. Minor misdeeds bring calamity upon the self; grave sins extend misfortune to descendants.

Third, one must not harbor malice or deceit, feigning kindness while concealing ill intent. The heart-spirit governs the five viscera; to dwell solely on evil is to unsettle this chief spirit, provoking the wrath of all others. Such anger shortens one’s lifespan—this is the most unforgivable transgression. If unchecked, its disasters will manifest.

Fourth, one must not defile the body with filth and dissipation, nor indulge in wine to the point of madness, altering one’s true nature, acting recklessly without restraint, ignoring prohibitions and taboos, disrespecting rulers and fathers, spewing curses and slander, invoking self-destruction, exposing private misdeeds, rebelling against order, committing incest, cursing heaven and earth, acting without limit or propriety, or brandishing blades in self-defense. Heaven will then unleash its wrath, and one will suffer the consequences alone.

Fifth, one must not covet wealth and possessions. Wealth and goods are but dung and dust, to be given and taken with the times. In this degenerate age, people treasure wealth, obsessing over profit, buying low and selling high, seizing every advantage, and deceiving the common folk. Those who obtain what they desire rejoice, while those who fail seethe with resentment and malice. Some even resort to violence over disputes, violating heavenly prohibitions, defying teachings and precepts, and clinging to greed and love of wealth. Yet wealth is the carving knife that harms the self—when the body perishes and the name is erased, what use is wealth? Those who hear these precepts nod in agreement, praising their wisdom and declaring them inviolable. Yet those who turn from the precepts toward profit, unable to restrain themselves, will suddenly face peril, walking into blades and inviting disaster. Their great destiny will be overturned. When ruin looms and they seek to repent, or when their sins are already sealed and they claim virtue, it is too late—their affairs are lost, and the Dao of Heaven offers no salvation.

Wealth, treasures, and sensual desires are the awls that pierce the eyes and the disasters that harm the body. The wise keep their distance, while fools delight in them. The wise, in all their movements—sitting, rising, sleeping, waking—exercise constant vigilance. Through self-discipline, their bodies remain unharmed, and their blessings become manifest.

Yet among those who now uphold the Dao with devotion, not one in ten thousand truly abides. How can this be said?

In this degenerate age of later generations, the customs of the time dictate such ways. People vie to outdo one another, coveting glory, wealth, and rank. Benevolence and righteousness are abandoned, while cunning and deceit are deemed wisdom. Fathers and sons deceive each other; rulers and ministers betray one another. They turn to mutual reliance and bribery to buy office, demoting the loyal and upright while appointing the flattering and wicked. They form factions with the treacherous, curry favor with their kin, and pursue wealth and status, casting aside the poor and lowly. In attire, carriages, and horses, they follow vain and worldly trends. The noble and the base alike share these ways—how, then, can they delight in the world and yet think of the Dao?

Such foolish people, though they may briefly prosper, are not to be envied. Why? The foolish, being shallow and base, when they attain glory and prominence, become arrogant, extravagant, and self-indulgent. Their conduct exceeds all bounds; they follow their desires without restraint, heedless of discipline and moderation. The Dao, being pure and empty, does not accept such people. The divine shuns them, while evil spirits assail them. Some resort to falsehood, turning from truth, and pray to ghosts for favors. Yet the net of Heaven is vast—its punishment has only not yet come. It is like cooking rice: when the fire beneath is extinguished, the steam within the pot lingers but briefly—how can it last? Though evil people may not yet face calamity, they are like that lingering steam.

All wise ones regard life as most precious and death as most base—is this not so? The Dao of Heaven is impartial and just: it rewards the good with life and punishes the wicked with death. Fortune and misfortune, blessings and disasters, arise from the unseen. Disasters are not averted by the rich and noble through prayers, nor are the poor and lowly punished simply for their poverty. Those who cultivate goodness receive blessings; those who do evil invite calamity. Even if a ruler possessed boundless treasures, when peril strikes and he clings to life, offering cities and measuring gold to beg for survival, how could it be granted?

The wise, though poor and lowly, need not forcibly seek wealth and rank, exhausting their essence and thought, neglecting what sustains them, growing arrogant and disordering their minds—such ways shorten life. Yet people, seeing the wealthy and noble, desire them in their hearts, striving to attain them, wearing themselves out in body and mind. Even if they gain such things, they are not vast. If one wishes to seek what one desires, one should cultivate the self and contemplate the Dao, harmonizing the household, young and old, in one mind. Sweep clean, burn incense, purify the space, and with reverence, openly express one’s wishes. The Dao, when subdued, dissolves all obstacles. If one’s desires are sincere, there is no need for gold, silk, or bribes; no need to seek through human affairs; no need for wine, meat, or sacrifices. Simply turn the heart to the Dao, and one will naturally attain it. Once attained, it fulfills all wishes—yet this is merely the Dao establishing merit through spirits and fragile things, and it need not be excessive.

Those who imitate worldly people, turning from the Dao to seek favors, act in vain. To obtain blessings, one must diligently cultivate the self with devotion, purifying the space and burning incense morning and night. In sitting and rising, one must contemplate one’s wishes without neglect. Then blessings will surely respond. Those who delight in this receive boundless fortune; those who do not follow their own hearts. The Dao is vast and magnanimous, allowing people to follow their inclinations. Only the wise understand this, striving with every thought, fearing they may not keep pace. The foolish, careless and retreating, distance themselves, fearing they may not flee far enough. Such is the difference between the wise and the foolish. Learners, exert yourselves and diligently seek.

In households that uphold the Dao, some encounter disasters, illnesses, deaths, official summons, or slander, leading to misfortune. Why is this? It is all due to human folly. Though they revere the Dao and wish to uphold it, their conduct and nature differ little from the worldly. They do not cast aside deceit and falsehood, yet seek to use such ways to disturb the true and upright—this can never succeed. Deceit and truth are like thieves and villains before a vigilant officer: they hide and flee, finding no place to stand. How can they offend the honorable? Their qi naturally does not flow. How, then, can one seek to commune with deceit?

Such people, though nominally upholding the Dao and hoping for its protection, are not accepted by the Dao. They claim allegiance to it, yet when disaster or peril strikes, when illness and pain afflict them, though they look to the Dao for shelter, it does not save them. Malevolent spirits and sudden evil assail them, and the Dao does not shield them. These foolish people, utterly ignorant, cannot restrain their hearts to repent and return sincerely to the Dao. Instead, they grow more perverse, calling the Dao unspiritual. Though they may not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor resentment.

Such people do not conduct themselves with reverence, their hearts and minds shifting and changing. They pass days and months in cowardice, hoping to escape disaster and harm—yet not one in ten thousand succeeds. Stubborn and perverse, their hearts unchanged, when their lives end, what use is regret? Foolish people—how pitiful!

The wise rectify their hearts and guard the Dao, never growing lax. They must admonish the foolish with diligence. Through self-discipline and reverence, they diligently cultivate the Great Dao. The Dao is most exalted, supreme, and without peer; it encompasses Heaven and Earth, governs the myriad spirits, gives life to all things—birds, beasts, creeping and crawling creatures, all that bears qi—all are formed and born by the Dao. The majesty and spirit of the Dao—what does it not gather? What does it not dissolve? What does it not subdue? It holds the pivot of the mechanism, commands the hundred ghosts, exists before Heaven, and endures eternally.

Yet humans dwell within it, their lives fleeting, like the blink of an eye. The Great Dao, vast and all-embracing, pities the brevity of human life and thus teaches people to cultivate goodness. Those who perfect themselves above become immortals; those in the middle become earthbound immortals; those below gain extended years. The Dao is lofty and majestic—what does it seek from people? Yet people do not respond with gratitude, diligently cultivating goodness. Though they may not attain the conduct of the middle virtue, they should at least fulfill the lesser virtue. Yet even this they fail to achieve, turning from truth, disobeying teachings and precepts. They think only of desires, wealth, glory, sensual pleasures, profit, treasures, wine, and meat, indulging their hearts without restraint, growing arrogant and extravagant—how can they think of the Dao? If people do not think of the Dao, the Dao does not think of them.

People are like fish, and the Dao is like water. Fish live when they have water, and die when they lose it; when the Dao departs, a person becomes empty—how can they hope for long life? The key lies in diligent progress and constant mindfulness.

All worthy ones who wish to preserve their bodies, cultivate conduct, keep their households safe and whole, must first abandon past transgressions and faults, then advance in later goodness. If you see others committing errors or faults, turn to admonish and exhort one another, teaching them to repent and reform. The merit and reward of such acts will bring boundless blessings. Do not say the Dao is formless and thus cannot be seen or served—this is merely arrogance and carelessness. Yet if you seek grace and fortune, you must serve with diligence, maintaining purity day and night.

When those of shared commitment encounter hardship, or when illness strikes, aid one another; in times of urgency, relieve one another’s distress. Do not use cunning to deceive the simple, nor exploit power to make false claims, nor invoke ghosts and spirits to frighten and coerce others. Do not, merely possessing slight wit, boast of your name and exalt yourself, belittling the foolish, slandering one another, speaking recklessly, or pointing out the faults of the worthy.

Do not harbor private greed and cruelty, honoring the noble while shaming the lowly, favoring the rich while abandoning the poor, relying on arrogance, or serving two masters with divided loyalty, seeking blessings as you please, thinking it charity. The Dao will never comply, ghosts will not serve you, and you will only destroy the true Dharma, bringing misfortune upon yourself instead.

Those of shared aspiration should seek one another; those of shared Dharma should befriend one another. If men and women are illiterate, yet wholeheartedly devoted to the Dao, they may invite those who are learned to recite scriptures and precepts for them. Gather in a quiet dwelling, or in a hall swept clean, where incense is burned, and all have bathed and purified themselves. Men and women should sit separately, their bodies composed, their spirits settled, their minds focused and attentive. Do not speak frivolously, nor lean toward depravity, nor let your thoughts wander, nor doze or sleep, nor exhaust your body in vain suffering, for it will bring no benefit.

If you can follow the precepts with diligence and unwavering effort, your household will receive blessings. The celestial officials and guardian soldiers will come to protect you, and in the end, you will be free from disasters, misfortunes, illnesses, and pains.

Among all things, humans are the most noble. Living between heaven and earth, all know the day of their birth but none know the day of their death. Whether good or evil, rich or poor, noble or lowly, each believes their lifespan will endure to its full term—who would wish to be the first to perish? Yet no one takes joy in this. Still, the wicked accumulate transgressions, and when their sins are complete, illness arises, leading to death, all without self-awareness. Only those who cultivate goodness receive blessings.

Human life receives its mandate from heaven, and its regulation lies with heaven. Heaven does not speak, so it falls to the sages. The sages, moved by compassion for the world, do not remain constant, and thus leave behind teachings and precepts. These teachings and precepts urge people to advance, to attain long life, preserve their bodies, and secure their lives without end. If all people could uphold the Dharma without weariness, how could they merely preserve their lives? They would gain the boundless blessing of extended years.

This is not something the wealthy and noble can obtain through bribes or requests, nor can it be summoned by offering wine and meat to ghosts and spirits. Those who follow the Dao—worthy ones—revere and uphold the teachings and precepts, devoting themselves with diligence. Though they may endure hardship first, their reward will follow. The response of blessings is certain. Whether wise or foolish, noble or lowly, all share the same wish. Yet only those who follow the Dao hold fast to their resolve, and thus can use the precepts to restrain themselves. In their conduct and movements, amid love and desire, they keep the precepts without violation, their hearts free from deviance.

When they see beauty or profit, they cover their eyes with the precepts; when they hear words of praise or blame, they block their ears with the precepts; when they taste sweet and fragrant delicacies, they seal their mouths with the precepts; when they crave wealth and treasures, indulging in love and desire, they subdue their hearts with the precepts; when they incline toward wickedness, intending evil deeds, they halt their steps with the precepts. If they uphold these without fail, they may be called enlightened. They should urge the ignorant and benighted to advance. Though the benighted cannot accept and apply these teachings, there is nothing to be done. Yet those who follow the Dao always wish to have good hearts and bestow kindness, for the Way of Heaven grants blessings.

Those who follow the Dao with diligence must exert themselves, uphold it for long, cultivate their resolve with firmness, and advance with single-minded devotion. There is none who does not first labor and later receive reward, crossing over to become an immortal of body and spirit. Thus, Master Yang followed the Dao for fifteen years without reward, cultivating himself without weariness. By the age of eighty, his merit was complete, his conduct renowned, and his blessings boundless.

All worthy ones who follow the Dao, serving with reverence and diligence, should be like one who is starving or thirsty, longing for food and drink; like one who encounters cold or heat, desiring a change of place; like one who has labored to exhaustion, longing for rest; like one who is weary, longing for sleep; like one who has a wish, longing for its fulfillment. When you think of the Dao and revere the True, desiring to transcend the mortal body, think of these longings. Exert yourself according to the Dharma without weariness, and you will obtain freedom from disasters, misfortunes, illnesses, pains, and sorrows. What wish will not be fulfilled? What blessing will not respond?

The Dao emerges from spontaneity, born before heaven and earth, named the Most High, Mysterious, and Venerable Supreme. The Three Blacks merge into One, becoming the Most High and Perfectly True Dao. The Dao is vast and great, encompassing heaven and earth, transforming the myriad spirits, subtly spreading beyond the eight directions, inwardly hidden within the finest hair. It gives life to the myriad things, governs the Three Heavens, and commands the thirty-six thousand spirits. It covers all that is great and enters all that is small. Serene and without action, it endures forever. Though it embraces the turbid, it is not defiled, and thus is the mother of the myriad things.

The Way of Heaven is impartial, yet it favors the good. The good preserve it and thereby attain immortality. This is not something the rich and noble can obtain by seeking, nor can the poor and lowly be excluded by disdain. If one can wholeheartedly delight in it, with sincere devotion and mindfulness, cultivating the body and practicing goodness, then one will unite with the Dao.

Yet most people in the world are foolish, prizing superficiality and falsehood. They indulge their bodies and desires amid the common crowd, seeking fleeting pleasures to gratify their bellies and eyes, yet they cannot endure hardship or diligently think of and follow the Dao. Those who follow the Dao must only accumulate merit and virtue, practice humility and yielding, act with benevolence and righteousness, cultivate gentleness and all goodness, and maintain purity and non-action. Though they may endure hardship at first, they will ultimately receive blessings, unlike those who follow the common way.

Those who merely covet fleeting gains will, after their lives end, become dung and dust, their souls and spirits rotting away. How vastly different are Daoists from the common folk! Why say so? Daoists are pure and upright, their names ascending to belong to Heaven; the vulgar are filthy and turbid, their deaths belonging to the earthly officials—how distant the difference! Fools cling to worldly ways and do not think of following the Dao; this is truly great delusion.

Every person has eyes, ears, a nose, a mouth, a mind, and two feet, yet the conduct of the wise and the foolish differs: the eyes fixate on profit and beauty, the ears heed pleasing or hateful words, the nose delights in sweet fragrances, the mouth craves the finest flavors, the mind indulges every desire, and the feet follow wherever whim leads, even toward wickedness and wrongdoing. The wise are not so—their eyes do not gaze upon what they desire, their ears do not heed evil or corrupt speech, their noses do not seek foul or fragrant scents, their mouths do not delight in rich flavors, their minds do not dwell on gratifying desires, and their feet do not rush toward evil deeds or wrongdoing. Such is the conduct of Daoists. Though Daoists know the pleasures of desire, they restrain their passions with precepts and thus do not commit evil. Their accumulated goodness becomes manifest, aligning with the laws of the Dao, and they receive boundless blessings. Fools know that evil brings swift misfortune, yet they cannot steadfastly uphold the precepts; opposing the Dao, how can they hope for blessings? If one desires blessings, why not emulate the Daoist?

To follow the Dao is to be pure, upright, and free from contrivance; one must only be diligent, cultivate conduct, and accumulate goodness. There is no fixed limit to this, nor is it hindered by water or fire, nor obstructed by poverty or low status, nor seized by the powerful, nor contested by the wealthy, nor burdened by labor or toil. Why not resolutely devote oneself to the Dao with wholehearted diligence?

A Daoist’s hundred deeds must be complete, their thousand virtues manifest. Though they may have nine hundred and ninety-nine virtues, if one remains unfulfilled and they are swayed by profit, all prior merit is discarded. Only by guarding the mind, upholding the precepts without fail, can one attain liberation from the world. Let the wise Daoist be diligent in practice.

**Precepts of the Great Daoist School**
The Great Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, nurturing all living beings and governing the myriad affairs. It is formless and imageless, vast and undifferentiated, yet it gives rise to the hundred thousand myriad things, beyond what mortals can name. From Heaven and Earth downward, all are born and perish by the Dao. The Dao bestows upon them a subtle qi, which manifests in three colors: the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Originating qi. The Mysterious is blue and becomes Heaven; the Originating is yellow and becomes Earth; the Primordial is white and is the Dao itself. Within these three qi, the upper and lower are regulated, becoming the parents of the myriad things. Thus, they are most revered and divine; from Heaven and Earth downward, nothing is born that does not receive this qi.

All long-enduring things guard the Dao and contain qi, possessing spirit, and thus can inhale and exhale yin and yang. The Dao gives birth to Heaven, Heaven gives birth to Earth, and Earth gives birth to humanity—all arise from these three qi. As two times three makes nine, humans have nine orifices and nine qi. When the nine qi flow freely, the five viscera are at peace; when the five viscera are at peace, the six bowels are settled; when the six bowels are settled, the spirit is luminous; and when the spirit is luminous, it draws near to the Dao. Therefore, those who practice goodness and uphold the Dao must carefully preserve the Way of life, and the Way of life must not lose its power. These three—Heaven, Earth, and humanity—do not depart from one another, and thus can transform along with Heaven and Earth.

The *Book of Changes* states: "With Heaven and Earth, there come the myriad things; with the myriad things, there come male and female; with male and female, there come husband and wife; with husband and wife, there come father and son." The bond of father and son is meant to extend through a hundred generations, ensuring the lineage does not perish. Yet in later ages, the world grew shallow, and people became foolish, delighting only in sensual pleasures, indulging in depravity and falsehood, gratifying their ears and eyes, wallowing in lust and beauty, their spirits in turmoil, coveting wealth and bribes, their qi rising in fury, and thus bringing forth a hundred illnesses.

From the time of the Yellow Emperor onward, people grew increasingly cunning, harnessing oxen and riding horses, using wealth to gain office, their desires gradually thinning until, by the Five Emperors, they were utterly dissipated. The Three Dynasties of Xia, Shang, and Zhou saw the world turn toward profit. The Qin began the Five Streams of decline, each harming the next. Those who died by violence numbered in the tens of thousands, beyond counting—all because they did not believe in the Dao. The Dao has been the teacher of emperors and kings through the ages, yet rulers failed to revere and uphold it, leading to the calamities of collapse and ruin. In times of peril, when all seemed lost, not one in ten thousand was saved.

The Dao values human life, and thus, at the end of the Zhou dynasty, it emerged in Langye, bestowing its teachings upon Gan Ji. The Way of Great Peace arose in the East, beginning to deliver the people from suffering. Many wished to believe in the Dao, but its transforming influence was still faint, and only those who listened were granted food and drink. The transformations of yin and yang grew more lenient, extending even to the spirits of parents, brothers, and ancestral sacrifices. Later, the qi of the Dao was to spread across the Four Seas, shifting to the Western Pass. Yet the Great Peace was not yet complete, and all required the oral instructions of a wise teacher, with omens and signs serving as mandates.

The Dao then composed the *Five Thousand Character Text*, containing the essentials of immortality. Its prohibitions grew stricter, its instructions more forceful for cultivating the body and nurturing life. The teachings on immortality were entrusted to the Pass Keeper Yin Xi, but the world was filled with fools, their hearts hesitant and doubtful. The dead piled up like landslides, and not one in ten thousand was preserved.

Entering the Western lands, the Dao’s teachings were bestowed upon the Hu people, its prohibitions most severe: no yin-yang union, no killing of living beings for food. The Hu could not believe in the Dao, and so it transformed into the teachings of the Perfected Immortals. The immortals communed with the heavenly beings, soaring amidst the azure clouds, dwelling by the shores of the Weak Waters. The Hu people kowtowed tens of thousands of times, their true mirrors reflecting the heavens. They shaved their heads and plucked their beards, vowing to believe in the Perfected Ones, and thus the True Dao flourished. Not only did the Hu fail to become like the Qin, but the Qin people themselves could not attain the True Dao.

As the Five Hegemons’ era declined, the Red Han inherited the Mandate of Heaven. The Dao aided in overcoming chaos, bestowing the *Yellow Stone Text* upon Zhang Liang. The Dao also took on forms and changes—who could recognize the true? After the Han dynasty was established, its later heirs acted recklessly, the people pursuing profit, the strong and weak clashing in anger. The Dao grieved for human life, and once departed, it was difficult to return. Thus, Heaven bestowed its qi to govern the people, and the newly emerged Lord Lao was born.

What is the "Ancient Muddled Ghost"? People fear ghosts but do not believe in the Dao, so Lord Lao bestowed upon Zhang Daoling the title of Celestial Master, most revered and divine, to serve as the teacher of humanity. You all should understand this—his honor surpasses that of heaven and earth—yet you remain obstinately confused, day after day, month after month, year after year, indulging in gluttony, yielding to the desires of ear and eye, disbelieving in the Dao. The dead number in the tens of thousands—how can this not be grievous?

In the fifth month of the first year of *Han’an*, in the city of Chishi within the Linju County of Shu Commandery, the Dao of *Zhengyi Mengwei* was revealed, forging a covenant with heaven and earth. Twenty-four *zhi* were established, distributing the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin to govern the people. Yet you still fail to grasp the root of the Dao, the source of truth and falsehood, competing only for worldly prestige, distinguishing between noble and base, defying the Dao and betraying virtue, seeking only to follow human whims. Human desires delight in chaos, and thus Zhang Jiao and the Yellow Turbans rose in rebellion. Do you know who Zhang Jiao was? Since then, how many tens of millions have died?

The Dao caused later heirs to divide *qi* to govern the people. For over forty years in the region of Han, the Dao’s prohibitions preserved the true origin of the numinous immortals. Yet what of the *Xianger*, the *Miaozhen*, the *Three Spirits and Seven Words*—were these not true and upright? To call the Dao deceitful is a reversal most lamentable. When the state of Yi collapsed, those displaced and dead numbered in the tens of thousands, wounding the hearts and wills of the people. Since the time of exile and dispersal across the land, the Dao has repeatedly saved your lives. Some resolved disputes through the exchange of *qi*; others, through the commands of former ministers, sought to rectify themselves. Yet you still do not believe—how pitiful!

If you desire dawn, you must first endure dusk; if you seek great peace, you must first endure chaos. If human evil cannot be eradicated, then war, plague, flood, and drought will bring death. You, with your meager fate, are destined to encounter these trials. Nevertheless, the virtuous shall suffer no harm. The Dao was cultivated in former times precisely to prepare for this day. Those who die before the advent of great peace shall have their descendants receive heaven’s grace.

In this degenerate age, with hearts unsteady, whether old or new households, if you perceive the changes of the world and reform your hearts to do good, practicing benevolence and righteousness, then goodness shall prevail. You may yet witness great peace, escape the throes of calamity, and become the seed-people of future generations. Even amid the disasters of war, plague, and flood, you shall remain unharmed at the brink of peril—for this is the Dao.

If you think of the Dao, the Dao will think of you; if you do not think of the Dao, the Dao will not think of you. Therefore, all people—men and women alike—you must solemnly cultivate yourselves, purify your conduct, honor your teachers, and uphold the Dao. In this shallow age, if families—husbands and wives, parents and children—remain steadfast together, they may endure. Yet how can you not inherit the practices of purity, integrity, filial piety, obedience to the Dao, reverence for teachers, veneration of ghosts, and devotion to the gods?

Now the world’s turmoil has departed like scattered sheep. War, plague, and malign *qi* spread across the four directions. Reflect upon the goodness of this day: honor heaven, revere the gods, cherish life, and practice the Dao. Strive to be true and upright, and the Dao will cherish you. If you do not think of the Dao, the Dao will distance itself from you, and calamity will swiftly draw near. Beware—do not regret later, for regret will bring suffering in future lives.

I traverse the four seas by day and night, journeying beyond the eight directions, desiring that rulers be benevolent, ministers loyal, fathers kind, children filial, husbands faithful, wives chaste, elder brothers respectful, and younger brothers obedient—so that the world may be at peace. Yet the people have long been mired in turbidity. Though they hear the words of immortals and the teachings of longevity, their hearts are deluded, their minds confused, and they persist in disbelief. Some practice goodness without knowing true uprightness; the foolish instruct the foolish, the wicked transmit wickedness. They do not reject evil but instead slander one another. Rulers and ministers vie for power, fathers and sons grow estranged, husbands and wives quarrel, brothers become divided. They exploit public office for private gain, men and women indulge in licentiousness, transgressing heaven and earth, disrupting the Five Constants. Outwardly correct but inwardly corrupt, they disorder the principles of the Dao. Thus, the Three Heavens grow indignant, murderous *qi* rages unchecked, the Five Planets lose their courses, Venus shines fiercely, winter winds howl with thunder, and comets rise and fall. Heaven hangs omens to warn humanity, yet people do not believe in the Dao. Those who die with Daoist aspirations shall have their *qi* linger in dark valleys.

The *Miaozhen* was composed by me, and the *Huangting*, the *Three Spirits and Seven Words*, are all instructive scriptures, the radiance of the *Daode*. The Dao does not wish to be named by form; the wise, seeing one, understand ten—like those who recognize sound. The Dao resides within your own body; how could it be found in another?

Yet you, in learning goodness, fail to grasp the root of the scriptures. The wicked instruct the wicked, embracing falsehood and discarding truth. I once recorded miscellaneous writings on short scrolls, filled with heterodox texts, and ordered them all destroyed. The *Jijiu* were unworthy, so I had them conceal these deeply, preserving them to this day. Now, the scholars of this degenerate age favor superficial doctrines, mistaking falsehood for truth. All such acts violate heaven’s prohibitions and will surely bring harm, never blessing. It is better to follow your heart’s desires than to labor in vain.

You need not trouble yourselves with heavenly judgment or lightly transgress the laws of the state. To bring about great peace, people must assist heaven in its work. Heaven is enlightened, and so too are the people enlightened. When the Five Constants are rectified, the Two Principles shall be settled—this depends on human effort.

All households, old and new—men and women, young and old—from the seventh day of the first month of the second year of *Zhengyuan* onward, if you can vigorously uphold goodness, adhere to these essential teachings, serve as loyal ministers and filial children, maintain faithful husbands and chaste wives, respectful elder brothers and obedient younger brothers, and harbor no duplicity within, then you may become good people and be counted among the seed-people. Even in times of hardship, you must aid them with your strength. If you delight in life and the Dao, regardless of age, with steadfast hearts and upright intentions, assist the state and sustain destiny, then the gods of good and evil shall know your deeds. Do not indulge in vain imaginings or heed the words of deceitful men who claim to know the Dao and teach it to others.

All male and female officials who received appointments in the past and remain in office without bereavement—since the fifth year of *Taihe*, each has established their own positions, no longer governed by my *qi* or guided by the true *qi* that directs the spirits in selection. Some have heeded *qi*-based decisions, trusted the visions of inner attendants, or acted under compulsion, unable to follow old protocols, yielding to persuasive claims. Some hold multiple offices simultaneously, while others occupy positions in name only. Those who accept such appointments recklessly defy the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, mismanage the documents of the Three Offices, and indulge in lavish feasting.

As for those in honorary or idle positions without documentary duties, they must rise and sit in accordance with the seasons, bearing the title of Heaven’s officials and abiding in the presence of the divine, to counter the errors of the secular world. Yet they remain ignorant of the Way of loyal ministers and filial children. When they hear of disasters and reprimands, they react as if personally afflicted, even resenting and falsely claiming that devotion to the Dao brings no benefit. Such actions incur the three thousandfold transgressions, which rebound upon themselves as if self-inflicted.

I once labored diligently to preserve your lives, hoping you would witness the Great Peace—yet now you seek it anew? In the late Han dynasty, when the imperial line waned, heroes ran rampant, the strong oppressed the weak, and the people grew cunning and deceitful. Men and women indulged in wantonness, governance failed, households could not restrain themselves, bandits plundered cities, and the resentful oppressed turned upon one another in servitude, devouring the common folk. The people’s grievances stirred rebellion, and perverse *qi* offended Heaven. Thus, the five planets lost their courses, comets swept the skies, Mars abandoned its station, powerful ministers vied for dominance, and traitors conspired for over a hundred years.

The Wei house, entrusted by Heaven to purge these ills, acted as destiny decreed. Recorded in the Yellow River and Luo River diagrams, celestial signs hung in the heavens—I, in obedience to Heaven and the times, commanded Emperor Wu as the state preceptor to traverse the land, filling pits with the dead. Once my state’s radiance was secured, the people suffered no harm, amassing gold and purple honors, and attaining long life. The seven sons and five marquises became the state’s glory, with generals, ministers, and kinsmen enfeoffed in abundance, their silver and bronze counted in the thousands. Fathers died and sons succeeded, younger brothers perished and elder brothers prospered, all bathed in sagely grace. Yet do you truly understand whence virtue and truth arise?

In the past, I opened the gates to teach goodness, but you refused to heed. From now on, I withdraw from the world, entrusting you to the Wei. With pure governance and Daoist rule, one may walk a thousand *li* alone, tigers and wolves cower in hiding, and doors need not be barred. Yet petty officials, ignorant of Heaven’s mandate and the order of fate, persist in perverse delusions. Those who instigate such things meet misfortune, even extending to their descendants. Do you not grasp the root of this?

In recent years, plagues have swept the land, eradicating the wicked—only the evil are slain. Those who uphold the Dao and delight in goodness are protected by Heaven, like an infant rescued from peril or the tongue avoiding the teeth. Do you not yet understand?

From this day forward, no official may presumptuously appoint themselves to office. Should you defy me again, do not complain of harm. When a *jijiu* treats an illness and the patient recovers, only to fall ill again, such a person is wicked—do not treat them further.

Instead, let every household transform itself through loyalty and filial piety: fathers kind, children filial; husbands faithful, wives chaste; elder brothers respectful, younger brothers obedient. Morning and night, purify yourselves, sever greed, abandon profit and desire, reform your wicked hearts, pity the poor and cherish the elderly, practice generosity and yielding, cast aside licentiousness and recklessness, temper joy and anger, and maintain harmony in thought and gaze. Assist the state and strengthen destiny, forsake past evils, and embrace present goodness. Thus, disasters will vanish, illness will cease, and you may become the seed-people of future generations.

Do not resent poverty or hardship, nor covet wealth and honor. What your ears and eyes have witnessed since ancient times—has wealth and nobility ever endured? Wealth is abandoned to the earth, bodies perish in the marketplace. Hence the saying: "The dead are no better than living rats." Attainment lies in destiny, and destiny is sought through the Dao. The Dao is hidden and nameless; names are the axes that hew the self. Good deeds leave no tracks, desiring to remain unseen. To practice the Dao is to cultivate the self, nurture life, and seek blessings—not to indulge oneself while teaching others. Indulgence makes one’s faults visible, sharpening the axe that hews the self. When the axe is sharp, blessings depart and calamities arrive. Can one not be cautious? Can one not stand in awe?

Heaven and Earth endure because they act without contrivance. To act without contrivance is to achieve all things, yet let none perceive your traces—only then can wonders arise. You, the common folk, are laughable indeed. At the slightest good deed, you seek recognition; at the slightest distinction, you crave praise. These bring no benefit to the Dao and violate its prohibitions.

Now I transmit my teachings so that all, new and old, may understand my heart. Do not betray this trust.

The Celestial Master’s Teaching
Now, therefore, I issue this instruction in seven-character verse, to thank all *jijiu* and the male and female people:

Heaven and Earth blend their *qi* like mist,
The four seasons and five phases turn in mutual dependence.
Were Heaven and Earth to unite without people,
Stars and constellations would fall into chaos, preceding mankind.
The twenty-eight lodges complete their cycles,
Mars and Venus emerge in their midst.
Should signs change and portents appear,
The foundation of Great Peace cannot rest.
Thus the axle creaks, unspeakable,
Words and decrees weigh heavy on the heart.
The *qi* courses to the eight extremes and returns,
Surveying the people of the Yi, Hu, and Qin.
No true people are seen—only corpse-people,
Who follow their hearts’ desires, wasting their spirits.
Their five viscera hollow, they become corpse-people,
Their lives irredeemable, claimed by the Earth Office.
Their bodies join the ghostly ranks in the Yellow Springs.
Yet if they reflect, repent, and follow my words,
They may ascend and transcend, becoming immortals,
Cautiously guarding yin and yang, preserving their spirits.
The five viscera and six bowels have their rulers and ministers,
Accumulating subtly to become true people.
If the spirit is sorrowful and sleepless,
Roaming among the people, inquiring of the five viscera,
It returns to speak with the true person—
The true person within the heart ascends to Heaven.

In crimson-yellow unlined robes and triple-seamed caps,
Bearing Heavenly Jade Tallies, they kneel before me.
They expound on the myriad people and the Dao of all folk—
Rewards and transgressions, promotions and demotions, all set forth in clear scripture.

Yangping governs the teachings. I acknowledge the Twenty-Four Districts, the Five Qi and Central Qi, the Four Divisions of Spirit-Conducting Qi, the Left and Right Supervising Spirits, the Libationers of the Districts, the Overseers of Separate Districts, and the scattered folk—men and women, old and young—of the various districts. In the first year of Han’an, on the first day of the fifth month, I received the Dao from the Divine Qi of the Han’s First August Emperor, Wang, pledging five pecks of rice as token, that all who might attain immortality could ascend and transcend.

Yet you, this generation, are even harder to instruct. How can I speak with you? You reverse right and wrong, twist crooked into straight. At this millennial convergence, what is to be done with you?

I, following the Most High Lord Lao, have traversed the Eight Extremes, inspecting and inquiring among the people, seeking the seed-people, yet none could be found. You, the common folk, bear no resemblance to the seed-people. You but covet glory and wealth, money, grain, silks, brocades, and fine cotton, making the sustenance of wives and children your sole concern. You seize the households of others to exact their taxes, extort their goods, and press the people into service, monopolizing their labor to till private fields and feed your wives and slaves. You care for none but yourselves, seeking merit and fame, enriching your bodies and selves, recklessly grasping for wealth. Your households know no harmony; quarrels and slander take precedence. Men and women, old and young, speak ill of one another, their words filling the roads with discord. Their speech diverges, their words clash, and they spread slander without end. They disregard the spirits and gods, distressing the Dao of Heaven, causing the qi to fall into chaos. Upon whom does the blame rest?

Each claims secret teachings, debating old affairs. I can no longer endure you. Do you even grasp the written decrees I hold for you? Libationers, overseers, men and women, old and young—each of you is muddled, no different from the vulgar. Your words belie your hearts; you are but human-headed worms. Your chambers know no restraint; you indulge in wanton lust. Men and women, old and young, fail to admonish one another. In your confusion, your conduct is turbid. Entrusted with the Master’s Dao and the Most High Lord Lao’s teachings, you debate old affairs, yet when I seek to enforce discipline, to cast the net and draw it tight, and to investigate and govern, among every ten of you—those who hold office, the district libationers—I shall execute three or four. Your names shall be returned to the Heavenly Bureau, where you will be interrogated, punished, and sentenced. Beware!

The qi grows urgent. Within no more than one, two, or three years, I shall ensure you hear and see for yourselves. Take heed!

Among the libationers and overseers, are there any of the old guard left? From the first year of Jian’an and Huangchu onward, each libationer and overseer has claimed to teach, each establishing their own district, no longer adhering to the old Daoist laws as they ought. I do not command you to follow the teachings of Yangping, Lutang, or Heming. Do your actions align with the old ways? If not, what urgency do I have? My urgency lies in turning you toward governing the people, in transmitting the teachings of the descending qi, and in exhorting you, this generation. The Most High Lord Lao oversees you all, desiring that each of you apply your minds, devote yourselves earnestly, and once more exhort yourselves to fulfill the Dao with utmost devotion, converting and guiding the common folk.

The Celestial Master’s Five-Word Linked Three Poems:

Linked Three, then Linked One,
Parting clouds to brighten the white sun.
The Three Calamities sweep away defilement’s weight,
As if emerging from beneath the covers’ state.

Linked Three, then Linked Two,
Glory and splendor are not worth the due.
Should you seek to pass the Five Trials’ test,
Your sincerity must be pure, your earnestness the best.

Linked Three, then Linked Three,
Wine and meat are not worth savoring.
Wash and refine the raw silk’s essence,
From bitterness to crimson, its transformation.

Linked Three, then Linked Four,
The wondrous Dharma is hidden in mystery’s core.
Yearn and aspire for the divine to descend,
With single-minded focus, let no duality offend.

Linked Three, then Linked Five,
The Daoist emerges from the thatched door’s hive.
Shedding the form’s confines,
Who can perceive the abyss profound?

Linked Three, then Linked Six,
The years depart, beyond pursuit’s tricks.
Though no bone-questioning fate is decreed,
Admonition still urges you to heed.

Linked Three, then Linked Seven,
Yearn and aspire to enter the Nine Chambers’ heaven.
Grasp and follow the sacred teachings’ thread,
And all ten thousand affairs shall be swiftly sped.

The wondrous Dao is not far,
Its flourishing depends on man’s part.
Loyalty and faith merge into one qi,
And you may transcend the mortal frame, set free.

The Three Calamities’ cycle hastens near,
Abandon profit and desire—best act with fear.
The central vision gradually firms,
And calamities and hardships will disperse like worms.

Examine and purge the heart’s transgressions,
Strive with might to set the standard’s lessons.
Pass the Five Trials, and all wishes may be won,
Yet lament the lack of natural affinity’s sun.

Entangled in the mundane’s flowing tide,
Seek long life, and among the worthy abide.
