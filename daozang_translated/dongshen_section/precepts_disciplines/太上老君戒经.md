# 太上老君戒经

**The Scripture of Precepts by the Most High Lord Lao**

**Preface to the Precepts**

The Most High Lord Lao journeyed westward, bound for Tianzhu. This occurred at the end of the reign of King You of Zhou. Traveling west from Zhou, he arrived in Tianzhu—a land so named. The account is recorded in *The Esoteric Wondrous Chapters*. There, he bestowed the *Scripture of Dao* and *Scripture of Virtue* upon the Pass Keeper Yin Xi. After Yin Xi received the scriptures, he further entreated the Master for the method of upholding them in body and conduct.

The transmission of the scriptures is fully documented in records and biographies; here, only the origins of the request for precepts are briefly recounted. Having received the scriptures in full, one ought to propagate and master them, hence the repeated entreaty for the method of upholding them in body and conduct. The method of bodily discipline is expounded in the scriptural text, yet its meaning is profound and subtle, not readily grasped by beginners. Thus, Yin Xi separately requested its essential precepts to sever later doubts.

Thereupon, Lord Lao again conferred upon him the essential precepts, universally enjoining all to uphold them and thereby transcend the world. For by upholding the precepts and forsaking evil, one naturally transcends the world. Yet to uphold the precepts is to revere the scriptures, and to revere the scriptures is necessarily to seek the Dao. Now that the method of reverent upholding has been heard, let the precepts be first expounded.

Here follow three hymns of praise. The hymns extol the matter at hand, clarifying that upholding the precepts and revering the Dharma are both causes of attaining the Dao. Thus, their fundamental purport is first chanted to enlighten beginners and guide them to its ultimate aim.

The first hymn elucidates the blessings of upholding the precepts, which gradually refine body and mind. The second hymn declares that as the Dharma becomes universal, households and states flourish alike, and heaven and humanity rejoice in unison. The third hymn reveals that as refinement deepens, the principles of the scriptures are exhausted, and upon exhausting these principles, one attains perfection. Hence, there are three hymns.

**Hymn One**
Delight in the Dharma as one delights in a wife—
A wife is a handle, meaning mutual reliance.
The way of human relations, the brush of yin and yang’s qi,
All life arises from husband and wife.
"Delight" implies mutual dependence and joy.
All beings delight in wives,
But if one grasps the Dharma as a handle for the mind,
There is no dependence, no pairing, yet life’s principles are self-sufficient.
Thus, to delight in the Dharma as one delights in a wife
Is to uphold the body and revere the scriptures.

Cherish the scriptures as pearls and jade—
The Dharma is that which is revered;
The scriptures are that which is studied.
"Cherish" means to treasure.
Of worldly treasures, none surpass pearls and jade,
Yet worldly treasures bring no benefit to the mind,
While the scriptures and Dharma yield eternal attainment.
Thus, the learner is bid to forsake the former and embrace the latter.

Uphold the precepts to restrain the six emotions—
The six emotions are the six desires:
The eye desires lewd sights,
The ear desires lewd sounds,
The nose desires fragrance,
The tongue desires rich flavors,
The body desires softness and smoothness,
The mind desires indulgence and excess.
These six matters all arise from the heart, hence they are called emotions.
They are the evil karma of the three realms, thus they must be restrained and abandoned.
If left unchecked, the six emotions run rampant,
In life, one is despised by the world;
In death, one is oppressed by ghosts.

Contemplate the Dao to dispel desires—
Precepts guard the external;
Contemplation gathers the internal.
Internal gathering arises from contemplating the Dao;
Contemplating the Dao, external desires vanish.
The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states:
"The Dao’s subtle heart you cannot yet discern.
Grasp its essentials, be cautious, and do not lose them.
First diminish desires, let not the mind run wild."
These are the very precepts here expounded.

Serene and unadorned, the qi of rectitude fills the courtyard—
That by which people are restless and competitive
Is the prompting of the six emotions.
If one upholds the precepts and contemplates the Dao,
The six emotions become clear and still,
The spirit is at peace, the qi is upright,
And no delusion or confusion can disturb.
The "courtyard" is the Yellow Court.

Desolate and still, the spirit abides in silence—
"Desolate" means without desire;
"Still and silent" means inner tranquility.

Heavenly demons all revere and protect—
Demons refer to the Five Great Heavenly Demons,
Who govern life and death from above the Six Heavens.
If one upholds the precepts and reveres the Dharma,
Ultimately attaining true immortality,
One transcends the Three Realms,
Hence all demons revere and protect.
There are four kinds of demons;
The other three reside within the human body,
Thus they are called heavenly demons.

Lifetimes receive great blessings—
To uphold the precepts and contemplate the Dao
Is to prevent the arising of all evils
And daily establish good causes.
Though passing through life and death,
In this life and the next,
One abides ever in blessings,
And upon attaining the Dao, these are called great.

**Hymn Two**
Lush and flourishing, households and states prosper;
Majestic and grand, the scriptures and Dao thrive—
The blessings of upholding the precepts
Ensure no premature death or harm.
In this life, one enjoys prosperity,
Descendants multiply,
Households and states flourish,
Extending to the ten directions,
All become lush and flourishing.

Heaven and humanity share the same aspiration—
"Heaven" refers to the immortals above;
"Humanity" refers to people in the world.
To uphold the precepts and revere the Dharma
Begins among people,
Where one receives retribution and ascends to heaven.
Advancing in practice among people,
One receives retribution and ascends to heaven,
Progressing in practice until attaining Highest Clarity.
Thus, heaven and humanity share the same aspiration.

Ethereal and distant, one enters the Great Vehicle—
The Great Vehicle refers to the Dharma of Highest Clarity.
From the coarse, one ascends to the wondrous,
Step by step, refinement deepens.
Having departed the world and ascended to heaven,
From heaven one rises still higher,
Hence it is called ethereal and distant.
"Ethereal and distant" describes a soaring, ascending demeanor.

**Hymn Three**
By the heart, establish the field of blessings—
Blessings are the fruits of goodness.
The cause of blessings does not lie elsewhere;
One’s own heart is the field of blessings.
If one cultivates the body and reveres the Dharma,
All evils are naturally removed,
Just as one tends a field,
Weeding out grasses and filth.
When grasses and filth are exhausted,
Naturally, fine grain is obtained.

Gradually, the Dharma Wheel ascends—
"Gradually" means step by step.
As blessings accumulate,
The Dharma Wheel gradually ascends.

Seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls;
This body ascends in broad daylight—
The attainment of the true Dao by this body
Brings joy to the seven ancestors.
This is the culmination of upholding the precepts and aspiring to the Dao,
Where merit is perfected and virtue is accomplished.

The Great Dao pervades the profound and void,
All dharmas are called the Dao—
There are the hundred officials and eighteen thousand kinds,
All belonging to the Dao of the Six Heavens and the Three Realms.
The Great Dao is formless and imageless, pervading the profound and void.
The Dao is nowhere absent; its principle responds without fail—hence it is called "great."
With thought, nothing fails to be awakened—
"Awakened" means responsive.
This clarifies that upholding the precepts and contemplating the Dao,
With mind intent, brings response; thought after thought unceasing,
Until the Dao is attained—all by the power of thought.
Refining the substance, one enters the immortals’ truth;
When desires are many, the spirit is turbid; when qi is pure, the substance is refined.
Refining the substance to become true—none but through the precepts.
Thus is the body of adamantine formed—
Its inner and outer firmness and truth leave no room for decay.
Surpassing the Three Realms’ hardships—
The Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm,
These Three Realms’ cycle of birth and death knows no rest,
Ever opposing the Three Wretched Paths—hence it is called "hardship."
Only by attaining truth can one transcend them.
The five sufferings of hell are dissolved—
The five sufferings are the icy pools, fire chariots, boiling cauldrons,
Knife mountains, and sword trees of hell.
Having transcended the Three Realms, no more suffering remains.
It is also said that the five paths are the five sufferings.
All return to the scriptures of the Most High—
The methods of the Highest Clarity.
All dharmas reach their culmination—hence they return to the scriptures of the Most High.
With tranquil thought, bow the head in reverence—
The recitation now complete, the dharma’s threads briefly revealed,
As the precepts are about to be expounded, one is bidden to still the mind,
Bow the head, and receive them.
Thereupon, Yin Xi, having heard the verses, bowed and stood,
Requesting to receive the precepts’ words.
The Old Master said: The first precept is against killing,
The second against stealing,
The third against licentiousness,
The fourth against false speech,
The fifth against wine.
These are the Five Precepts.
If there are faithful men and faithful women—
If men and women resolve to receive the precepts, they attain the title of the faithful.
Upholding the Five Precepts to the end of life without transgression—
This means holding the precepts until life’s end without violation.
These are the faithful men and faithful women.
At the outset, the resolve earns the title of faithful;
If midway one falters, the faithful heart is lost.
Only by upholding them to life’s end, receiving blessings in the next life,
Is the principle of the faithful fully preserved—hence the reiteration.
The Old Master said: The precept against killing—
All sentient beings, from those possessing qi upward,
To the flying and wriggling creatures—none may be killed.
All wriggling creatures delight in life;
Even mosquitoes, ants, and earthworms know to avoid death.
The Old Master said: The precept against stealing—
From a single coin upward, whether owned or ownerless,
Anything not one’s own must not be taken.
On land, the earth officials; in water, the water officials;
Among men, the human masters—thus there are no ownerless things.
This speaks of ownerless as meaning no one presently guards them.
The Old Master said: The precept against licentiousness—
Outside of husband and wife,
If one has left the household, neither marrying nor taking a spouse,
Neither men nor women may transgress.
Even between husband and wife, excess is licentious transgression.
The Old Master said: The precept against false speech—
Speaking of what one has not seen or heard,
Or what the mind does not comprehend—all is false speech.
The spoken matter contradicts the mind.
There are also ornate words, flattery, duplicity, and divisive speech—
These belong to later precepts.
The Old Master said: The precept against wine—
Unless for bodily illness or ritual propriety, one must not drink.
"Bodily illness" refers to one’s own ailments requiring wine.
"Ritual propriety" clarifies that it is not for secular gatherings or sacrificial offerings to ghosts and spirits.
For rites of honor and inferiority, or feasts for the true spirits,
One does not lose oneself.
The Old Master said: These Five Precepts are the root of bodily conduct,
The foundation of upholding the Dharma.
The body’s root is without evil; through evil, the precepts are upheld.
With a pure heart and a clear body, one can uphold the Dharma—
Hence they are called the Dharma’s root.
Good men and good women—
The previous chapter spoke of the faithful, clarifying that receiving the precepts and reforming evil earns this title.
Here, "good" refers to innate goodness,
Bestowed by karmic endowment, not arising from upholding precepts.
Those who delight in wholesome dharmas—
All dharmas.
By virtue of past goodness, they are able to delight in them.
Upholding them to life’s end without transgression—
Transgression is a flaw, failing to complete the beginning and end.

The violation of precepts is arrogance, giving rise to disbelief.
This is what makes one a faithful follower—
Receiving the scriptures, receiving the Dharma, forever attaining the true Dao.
To "receive the scriptures" means not merely to study and practice;
Only those who practice truly receive the Dharma.
Receiving the Dharma, one receives the Dao—
Hence it is said to attain it forever.
"Forever" means far-reaching.
Thereupon, Yin Xi, having heard and received them in full—
"Full" means completion—
Heard the precepts spoken and personally received them,
Unlike the *Five Thousand Characters*, which Laozi himself produced.
He bowed twice and asked: Why are there five?
Human wrongdoings are countless, all requiring prevention and restraint—
Why then are only five precepts taught?

The Old Master said: The five encompass all evil.
All manifold evils arise from these five;
If one upholds these five precepts, all evils are extinguished.
Just as heaven has five luminaries to govern the myriad spirits—
The five luminaries are the stars.
"Spirits" refers to divine spirits.
Earth has the five phases to sustain all life—
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.
All living beings depend on them for sustenance.
Humans have the five viscera to govern spirit and clarity.
The reason humans possess discerning consciousness lies in the five viscera.
The six senses and five desires each have their origins,
Thus the five precepts counter and govern them.
This makes clear that these five precepts,
From heaven to humanity, are the foundation of the Three Powers,
Not newly established.

"Precepts" means prevention—preventing transgression.
Before transgression, prevention ensures it is not committed;
After transgression, restraint ensures it is not repeated—
Both embody the meaning of prevention.
If transgression is not prevented,
The Three Realms overflow with suffering, and the heavens and humans become empty.
Failing to prevent transgression allows evil to proliferate daily.
Evil leads to karmic retribution,
Filling the Three Realms of suffering.
Once the Three Realms are full, the ghostly path spreads unchecked.
All beings have a fixed number—
When the Three Realms are full, the heavenly realms become empty,
And human births diminish.
Thus, the five precepts.

This clarifies the root of the five precepts and their origin.
Yin Xi said: How great are the precepts! Why then do transgressions occur?
Having heard this teaching, he marveled at their greatness.
Though these precepts have existed since ancient times,
Why do beings still commit such transgressions?

The Old Master said: Originally, there was no transgression;
Even if one transgresses and then receives the precepts, nothing is lost.
"Originally, there was no transgression" means that in a past life,
One had already received these precepts, so in this life, there is no transgression.
If this life has transgressions, it is because in a past life,
There were no precepts, or they were violated—hence the transgression.
Yet if in this life one receives and upholds them,
Then in this life there is no transgression, and future lives will be good.
Thus, though one transgresses and then receives the precepts, nothing is lost.
The earlier verse says: *Life after life, one receives great blessings.*
This is its meaning.

Yin Xi asked about one transgression,
But the answer addressed three—
Responding to the latter question while revealing past, present, and future lives.
It clarifies that humans, endowed with the Dao, are originally without transgression,
As the meaning is shown in the scriptures.

Yin Xi said: May I ask about their origin?
Since transgression and attainment are now clear, the principle must be elucidated—
Thus he inquired about their origin to seek their culmination.

The Old Master said: Now I shall fully explain their origin for you.
Following his question, he expounded their reason—hence "fully."
Listen carefully, listen carefully and receive them,
So that all may know.
"Listen carefully" means to guard against deficiencies.
"Receive carefully" means to avoid falsehood and delusion.
Only then can all be made to hear and know.

Yin Xi bowed twice and stood reverently to listen.
"Stood reverently" means what is now called kneeling upright.

The Old Master said: The five precepts began with heaven and earth,
And exist alongside all things.
Where there are heaven and earth, there are the myriad things;
Where there are the myriad things, there are attainment and loss;
Where there are attainment and loss, there are the Dharma and precepts to govern them.
Upholding them brings fortune; losing them brings misfortune.
Good fruits are fortune; evil retribution is misfortune.
The matters of fortune and misfortune are fully set forth in later chapters.
All who attained the Dao in the past did so through them.
Thus, the spirits number twenty-five—
The number five times five.
The *Inner Classic* speaks of twenty-five spirits,
The numinous essence of the human body,
Corresponding to the celestial perfected and residing within.
When one upholds the precepts and the body is pure, these spirits remain at peace.
The meaning of the *Five Thousand Characters* lies herein.
The matters of transgression are all contained within the *Five Thousand*,
While these precepts were expounded specifically in response to Yin Xi’s request.

The Old Master said: The five precepts—
In heaven, they are the five planets:
In the east, Jupiter; in the west, Venus; in the south, Mars;
In the north, Mercury; and in the center, Saturn.
When the heavenly Dao loses the precepts, omens and disasters appear.
The five planets each occupy a direction, their movements, qi, and colors all following constancy.
If the heavenly cycles lose harmony, yin and yang fall into disorder,
Deviating from their proper courses and manifesting portents.
Thus the scripture says: *If heaven cannot remain clear, it will surely split.*
"Split" refers to the ruler losing virtue, yin and yang collapsing,
And the five planets reversing their courses.

On earth, they are the five peaks:
In the east, Mount Tai; in the south, Mount Heng;
In the west, Mount Hua; in the north, Mount Heng;
And in the center, Mount Song.
When the earthly Dao loses the precepts, the hundred grains do not ripen.
The five peaks each govern their direction, the sources of wind, clouds, water, and rain.
If the earthly Dao loses the precepts,
Disastrous winds and floods arise, along with droughts,
And the hundred grains fail to bear fruit.
All grasses and trees are called "grains."
The scripture says: *If earth cannot remain stable, it will surely erupt.*
This refers to mountains collapsing and rivers drying,
All things suffering calamity—all due to the ruler’s faults.
First, omens appear in heaven, then disasters descend upon earth.

In the numerological scheme, they are the five phases.

The east corresponds to wood, nine; the south to fire, three; the west to metal, seven; the north to water, five; and the center to earth, twelve. Though the center holds its position, it resides within the four seasons. When the five numbers lose the precepts, water and fire clash, metal and wood injure one another. The five numbers shift and transform, completing the four seasons; if they falter, disasters, pestilence, and warfare arise. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: *When the five phases do not overcome one another, all things may be preserved whole.*

In governance, they are the Five Emperors:
The east, Taihao of wood; the south, the Flame Emperor of fire; the west, Shaohao of metal; the north, Zhuanxu of water; and the center, the Yellow Emperor of earth. When the Five Emperors lose the precepts, their reigns are cut short, and their lives end prematurely. The Five Emperors succeed one another in rule, the five phases generating one another, each assuming office according to its direction. If they lose the precepts and govern with tyranny, their states will not endure, nor will they attain longevity.

In the human body, they are the five viscera:
The liver pertains to wood, the heart to fire, the lungs to metal, the kidneys to water, and the spleen to earth. When the five viscera lose the precepts, one’s nature turns mad. Engaging in evil deeds causes the five viscera to lose their spirit; when the five viscera lose their spirit, one’s nature becomes deranged. *Deranged* means perverse. One must observe the five precepts to guard against the five evils. Each evil arises from its own source, yet even a single evil can drive one’s nature to madness—it need not wait for all five. Here, *five* is spoken to encompass their totality. The scripture says: *Indulging in hunting and chasing game drives the heart to madness.* The heart governs the five viscera, so this is but one example. Thus, a later passage states: *Lose one, and life cannot be fulfilled.*

Furthermore, examining the intent of the precepts—from heaven to humanity—all speak of losing the precepts as the cause of fortune and misfortune, making clear that the rise of calamity begins with people. Therefore, when rulers act with virtue, the myriad people depend on them; if they act wickedly, the realm suffers. Thus, we know that in the governance of the Three Powers, success and failure are shared alike. Though from heaven to humanity there are five categories, the root of failure lies solely in people. Hence, the next passage states: *To observe the precepts in this is to accord with that.* Laozi says: *These five matters: observe the precepts in this to accord with that.* The five matters above all depend on people, hence *observe the precepts in this*. *To accord with that* is to follow principle. The arising of calamity stems from violating principle; if one acts in accordance with principle, what need is there for precepts? This makes clear that precepts are for guarding against transgressions. If one transgresses and does not guard against it, how can the arising of disaster and calamity be averted?

The precept against killing corresponds to the east, the qi of birth and growth. Yet when people violate this precept, the liver suffers harm. Qi and numbers resonate, extending from within to without. The liver governs growth and nourishment, so all things naturally cherish life. A nature that harbors killing reverses the qi, which surges against the liver; the liver’s qi becomes fierce and violent, bringing disaster upon the self—hence, *harm*.

The precept against stealing corresponds to the north, the essence of great yin, which governs storage and concealment. Yet when people steal, the kidneys suffer misfortune. The kidneys belong to great yin, and yin governs storage and concealment, so all things naturally know how to gather and preserve. When people steal, the kidney qi is injured—hence, *misfortune*. *Misfortune* is the consequence of accumulated evil.

The precept against licentiousness corresponds to the west, the quality of lesser yin, where male and female remain steadfast. Yet when people indulge in licentiousness, the lungs suffer corruption. The lungs belong to lesser yin, and metal’s nature is firm and steadfast, so men are upright and women chaste. When people indulge in depravity, the lung qi withers and dries—hence, *corruption*, the baleful qi of drought.

The precept against intoxication corresponds to the south, to fire, the qi of great yang, by which things reach completion. Yet when people indulge in wine, the heart suffers its poison. The heart governs the entire body and brings human beings to fulfillment—this is the qi of great yang. Those who indulge in wine allow poison to surge into the heart, causing the viscera and bowels to fall into neglect, leading to confusion and ruin.

The precept against false speech corresponds to the center, the virtue of earth, which is trustworthy. Yet when people speak falsely, the spleen suffers disgrace. The spleen pertains to earth, and earth is trustworthy and constant—hence, *virtue*. The nature of human beings takes trust as its foundation; when people speak falsely, disgrace returns to themselves. The spleen governs the entire body with righteousness.

The five virtues support one another and must not be diminished. *Diminished* means abandoned; *deficient* means injured. When people receive life, they must possess these five virtues. If the five virtues are not diminished, one will enjoy good fortune until the end—hence, *they must not be diminished or deficient*. Laozi says: *Lose one of these five, and life cannot be fulfilled.* Earlier, the origins of the human body were explained, each arising from its own source; this is called *violation and transgression*, the fault of diminution and deficiency—hence, *life cannot be fulfilled*. *Life cannot be fulfilled* means failing to complete one’s allotted nature and years. The *Yuanming Bao* states: *Acting with uprightness does not exceed attaining one’s destined lifespan.* *Destined lifespan* is the proper life.

Therefore, not killing extends even to the absence of a killing mind. The rise of a killing mind begins with a lack of vigilance, which then grows severe. Here, *even to the absence of a killing mind* means guarding against it from the slightest inclination. Even if one does not personally kill, one may cause others to kill, encourage others to kill, watch others kill, or order others to kill—if the mind does not deem it evil, it is the same as killing. The reason is that all such acts arise from a killing mind. Without vigilance, one will never achieve completion.

Not stealing extends even to the absence of illicit gain. Those who covet and steal begin with petty theft; if petty theft goes unchecked, it leads to grand larceny. One may exploit public benefit for private gain, manipulate the law to seize property, rely on power and influence to enclose mountains and marshes, or deceive and coerce the foolish to exploit their labor. Whatever is obtained in such ways is not by right principle—it is the same as stealing. Hence, *even to the absence of illicit gain*. This makes clear that it is not only outright theft but all forms of greed.

Not engaging in sexual misconduct extends even to the absence of impure thoughts. Sexual misconduct arises from indulgence, whether in men or women, their desires are manifold. Among the Five Precepts, none is weightier than this, for it leads to the ruin of body and family—thus, no further discussion is needed. Yet there are those who, unafraid of the net of transgression, use the pretext of the Dao to gratify their lusts, outwardly feigning devotion while inwardly wallowing in impurity. Such persons are truly great evildoers, hence *even to the absence of impure thoughts*. All sexual conduct outside the bond of husband and wife is impure.

Not consuming intoxicants extends even to resisting coercion. Wine leads to transgressions, and though one may be pressed by superiors, it can result in chaos and loss. Now, with the precept as one’s support, even under coercion, one does not violate it. The harm of wine is like fire left unchecked—it grows ever fiercer and does not cease until it burns itself out.

Not speaking falsehood extends even to the absence of leakage. A mind of truth harbors no private malice. Without private malice, there is nothing to conceal. Without concealment, what can leak out? Only thus may one be said to have achieved completion. Earlier, it was said that losing one precept prevents the attainment of destiny—this principle was not yet fully expounded. Now, with this reiteration, the meaning is roughly clear, hence *only thus may one be said to have achieved completion*.

Lord Lao said: Within the precepts, sexual misconduct and wine give rise to the Five Evils. Lust leads to extravagance, extravagance to demand, demand to theft, theft to deceit, deceit to fear, and fear to killing—all these stem from lust. Wine incites madness and also fuels lust. The *Taiqing Sutra* states: The human body contains thirty-six thousand worms, all dwelling within the five viscera and the skin. When one drinks wine, these worms stir; when they stir, all manner of evils arise, and with evils arisen, there is nothing one will not do. Thus it is said to give rise to the Five Evils.

Precepts are for restraining evil. In this degenerate age, men and women, though bound by kinship, fall into incest. *Huān* means mixing; *lí* means violating. It speaks of how the mind of lust knows no bounds of lineage, using the pretext of the Dao to intermingle without distinction.

Arrogance toward superiors and violence toward inferiors defile the celestial virtue. Arrogance toward the divine is defilement; mutual harm among the lowly is violence. Drunkenness and brawls lead to lawsuits, bringing calamity, disgrace, and ruin. *Chén* means indulgence; *xù* means daily drunkenness. *Zhēng* means conflict; *sòng* means litigation. Harming life is calamity; ensnaring the body is disgrace.

Deceit and fraud know no bounds. *Wàng* means falsehood; *zhà* means deception; *qī* means trickery. Such persons, in their pursuit of wealth and profit, disregard all three.

Theft among the six relations is not limited to outsiders. Husband and wife, father and son, brothers—these are the six relations. Theft is not only against others; even a son may steal from his father, a wife from her husband, or brothers from one another—nothing is beyond them.

Killing living beings to nourish body and mouth. Killing for medicine is to nourish the body; slaughtering for the kitchen is to profit the mouth. Such persons, seeing life, incur karmic debt and forever sink into suffering. Those who do not receive the precepts in life, who only practice evil, see their evil karma grow and fall into the Three Wretched Realms. Enduring the Five Evils without respite, those who commit the Five Evils enter hell, suffering the full retribution of the Five Torments without end or limit.

The sutras say: The retribution in the Three Wretched Realms lasts at least one kalpa. If there are those who escape, it speaks of varying degrees of severity—some may eventually return to be born among humans. They will be born among the barbarians of the frontier, short-lived and maimed. The frontier barbarians are savages who devour one another. This is the retribution for killing: if born in such lands, or even in the Central Kingdom, they will be short-lived or physically impaired.

Their spouses will be ugly and base, unchaste and impure. This is the retribution for lust. *Chǒu* means repulsive; *è* means vile. Unchastity is lust; impurity is greed.

Poverty, exposure to the elements, and constant insecurity—even if they possess wealth, it will be seized by others. This is the retribution for theft. Exposure means having no shelter; insecurity means being unable to escape hunger and cold. Even if they have property, it will be plundered to repay past debts.

Their words will not be trusted, and no one will befriend them. This is the retribution for falsehood. Whether their words are right or wrong, none will believe them. Without trustworthiness, how can they have friends?

Their thoughts will be dull and obstructed, and all will disdain and belittle them. This is the retribution for wine. Born in turbidity, they will lack clarity in death. How can such a rebirth be pure? Thus, they are despised by all.

Lord Lao said: Devout men and devout women who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao will enjoy peace and happiness in this life, free from sorrow and affliction. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Way set their minds on the Dao. With all evils dispelled, they abide in goodness forever—what sorrow or affliction could there be? Sorrow and affliction arise from evil deeds, for they are bound to evil. How could they come without cause?

They will be revered by all. Not engaging in lust, they earn universal respect. All who see them will feel awe and joy. Without the mind of killing, all who encounter them will feel awe and joy. They will constantly receive offerings. Not stealing, people will gladly provide for them. All will look up to them. Not speaking falsehood, their words will always be true—who would not revere them? Their wisdom will be profound and subtle. Not drinking wine, their thoughts will be calm and serene, entering the profound. Abiding in purity, their four elements will be whole and firm. Having received these five rewards, wherever they go, they will be loved and respected. Constantly pure, untainted by the vulgar, their four limbs will be sound. Without external distractions, their internal organs will be unharmed, their exterior and interior firm and unbreachable, and no illness will arise. Thus, they will be able to cultivate and gather all dharmas to attain the true Dao.

Those prior teachings expounded the karmic retribution of evil conditions arising from the absence of precepts. Here, the observance of the Dharma is shown to bring blessings in this very life, even unto the attainment of the Dao—none of this is possible without it. Furthermore, it is made clear that to walk the Way, one must cultivate and gather all virtues to realize the true. Thus, the Dao is elucidated through the Dharma, and the true is made manifest through the person.

Yin Xi bowed twice and said: "I venture to ask about the method of receiving and upholding the precepts?"
*(Note: "Receiving" here should be understood as "transmitting.")*
Now that the precepts are fully expounded, the next inquiry concerns the rites of transmission and upholding. Having raised this new question, he bowed again to make his request.

Lord Lao said: When men and women hear the Dharma and generate faith, they take refuge in the Three Treasures.
*(This refers generally to those who first arouse the aspiration.)*
The Dharma here means the precepts. The Three Treasures are also called the Three Honored Ones or the Three Masters: the Dharma of the Most High, the transmission of the Dharma of the Most High, and the lineage of that transmission—these are the Three. Thus, the Most High is the lord of all dharmas, the transmitter of the Dharma is the teacher of all learners, and Lord Lao is the master of this Dharma, while other teachings follow their respective origins.

They should immediately bow their heads in reverence.
*(Those who wish to arouse the aspiration should be transmitted the precepts at once, without hesitation or inquiry into their past conduct.)*
Why is this so?
The precepts are fundamentally for the removal of evil; as long as one has the aspiration, what need is there to discuss past actions? Moreover, the human mind is often deluded—though a good impulse may arise momentarily, it may soon waver and retreat. Therefore, one should seize the moment to encourage, not waiting until the day’s end.

They take refuge in the Great Dao with their bodies, take refuge in the Great Dao with their spirits, and take refuge in the Great Dao with their lives.
This threefold refuge addresses the fact that the body may be good or evil, the spirit may know fear, and life may be long or short—these are the three necessities for all sentient beings. Now, by taking refuge in the Dao with all three, one who receives and practices the precepts will: first, ensure that in life and death, they remain constantly good and do not fall into evil conditions; second, strengthen and rectify their spirit so that they need not fear demonic influences; and third, enjoy longevity in this life without suffering untimely death. Though the refuges are three, in essence, they are one. The earlier reference to taking refuge in the Three Treasures pertains to the Dharma, while this reference to the Great Dao denotes the eternal—what was previously praised as the mysterious and empty Dao.

The men and women
declare their names and make their vows.
They abandon the perverse ways of the world,
*(Abandon means to leave behind. All worldly pursuits are perverse ways.)*
and uphold the true precepts,
*(Like holding an object in hand, ever fearful of losing it.)*
resolving to keep them with their bodies and lives, never violating or transgressing them.
*(The body refers to conduct; life refers to consciousness. Thus, they resolve never to transgress or diminish the precepts in either aspect.)*
Thereupon, they praise and recite, receiving with reverent hearts.
*(This refers to the recitation of the Five Precepts. The transmission is received in person: after completing the Three Refuges before the Three Treasures, bowing their heads, they make their vows, receive explanations of each precept, and are then transmitted the precepts. A reverent heart means treating the occasion as if in the presence of the divine.)*

Lord Lao said: If men and women, having received the true precepts, further seek the scriptures,
*(This refers to the Five Thousand Character Text.)*
they should first receive the precepts.
*(Earlier, it was said that after receiving the precepts, one may receive the scriptures; now it is said that one should first receive the precepts. The former refers to the time of receiving the scriptures, when the precepts are again expounded. If both scriptures and precepts are to be received, the precepts should come first.)*
Only after ensuring their steadfast purity should the scriptures be transmitted.
*(This examines whether the recipient has upheld the precepts; if there have been lapses, they are permitted to renew themselves, making clear the reason for re-transmission.)*
They should reverently uphold them day and night, without ceasing at any time.
*(Morning and evening rituals must not be neglected, even in hunger or cold—this is the way to uphold the scriptures.)*
Each month, they observe the ten days of uprightness;
*(The month has ten fast days.)*
each year, they observe the three months of fasting.
*(One year includes three months of prolonged fasting.)*
After reciting the scriptures ten thousand times, they ascend in broad daylight to the morning realm.
*(Reciting aloud is called "recitation." The morning realm is the domain of true immortals. Through these fasts and recitations, one attains the flight of immortality. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "With meticulous and wondrous words, the inner meaning does not depart; recite the text ten thousand times, and with sincere thought, penetrate it thoroughly." This is the meaning.)*
The ten days of uprightness and three months of fasting have their own separate scriptures.

If one expounds and disseminates the scriptures, propagating their wondrous meanings, this brings great benefit to sentient beings, delivering them from the three evil destinies and all suffering.
*(To expound and lecture, guiding those who have not yet awakened, is to widely bestow merit and deliverance, rescuing beings from the three evil destinies.)*
Through such merit and virtue, one severs the roots of past karma, eradicates immeasurable afflictions, and ascends to the Upper Clarity, never to regress.
*(When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the roots of birth and death are extinguished, and the Dao of the Upper Clarity is attained without regression.)*
This briefly outlines the culmination of the path of cultivation—from upholding the precepts to the attainment of non-action, encompassing the great Dharma from beginning to end.

Lord Lao said: Devout men and devout women, whether householders or renunciates, who receive and uphold the scriptures, aspire to the divine immortals, recite day and night, and seek their wondrous meanings—
*(This refers to the principle of non-action.)*
they cast aside all defilements and distractions, harmonizing the mind and mastering the nature.

This refers to worldly learning.

The superior person practices the Dao amidst the marketplace, while the inferior person retreats to the mountains and forests. Mountains and forests signify that impurities still abound, and one cannot yet immediately harmonize with stillness, thus withdrawing from the world to cultivate and subdue the self. Yet if one can cultivate and subdue the self within the world, there is no need to rely on mountains and forests.

With a gentle countenance and kind demeanor, one exhorts all men and women: when the mind is coarse, the appearance becomes harsh; when the intent is wild, the speech turns foul. But with a harmonious expression and soft words, those who see will feel affection and no anger will arise.

Distance yourself from the five evils, uphold the five precepts, and make offerings to the Three Treasures. Having grasped the most wondrous principle and discerned good from evil, one expounds what one has attained, urging others to abandon all evil conditions.

Strive for their accomplishment without regard for ease or hardship. Recognize differences in capacity—some are sharp, some dull; some natures are good, some evil—yet adapt to others, guiding them into the Dao. Do not seek personal gain, nor shrink from humiliation: this is teaching.

Those who fully uphold the great precepts, engage in ascetic practice with purity, practice generosity and forbearance, and sacrifice themselves to save others—these are the practitioners of cultivation. The great precepts comprise the one hundred and eighty precepts, the Taiqing precepts, and others. The Fourfold Bright Prohibitions and the great taboos of the immortals are all essential methods for those who study the Real.

Diligence means unwavering generosity: whatever is sought, one gives without refusal, sparing neither wealth nor goods, regardless of abundance or lack. Forbearance means enduring insult without complaint—even when beaten or whipped, one harbors no resentment. Sacrifice means rushing to aid those in peril without regard for one’s own life; if one sees the cold and hungry, one strips oneself to provide, not waiting to be asked.

Those who leave the world to dwell in secluded abodes, focusing the mind on ultimate stillness, undisturbed by any hardship—these are the devotees of the spirit. Leaving the world to dwell in mountain seclusion avoids the filth of the mundane; solitary wandering without companionship leaves no room for other thoughts. "Focused" means unifying the will; "mind" means contemplating the attainment of the spirit. "Stillness" means concentration: with the mind settled in concentration, wisdom stabilizes within, and no external hardship or honor can disturb it.

Such practice necessarily culminates in non-action. To cultivate these deeds is to assuredly realize the truth of non-action.

Lord Guan Yin asked: "Does upholding the scriptures entail transgressions?"

Since the precepts on good and evil have already been expounded, one who knows the scriptures yet violates them incurs fault and loss. How so? This is a general inquiry into all scriptures, not limited to the Five Thousand Characters. As the earlier verse states, "All归 to the Supreme Scripture," and what follows clarifies the destruction of the Dharma and the difficulty of transmission and reception—thus we know this to be the case. This exchange between Lord Guan Yin and Laozi serves to elucidate matters of sin and merit.

Laozi replied: "There are thirteen."

The scripture states: "Of those who follow life, there are thirteen; of those who follow death, there are thirteen." To uphold the scriptures and follow the Dharma is to attain long life; to violate the precepts and commit evil is to move toward death. Having answered the question regarding faults and losses, he thus speaks directly of the thirteen.

Lord Guan Yin asked: "What does this mean?"

He inquired about the matter of the thirteen.

Laozi said: "Listen carefully."

Since there is further clarification, he admonishes again: The thirteen are the six dusts and six consciousnesses, all arising from the mind. The six dusts refer to the six entrances, for what enters can defile the true nature—hence they are called dusts. The six consciousnesses are the roots of the six entrances, capable of generating discrimination—hence they are called consciousnesses. The mind is their master, making thirteen in total; the lower scroll provides a full explanation. All causes of evil arise from the thirteen, and the path to goodness arises from their cessation. Entering goodness is life; committing evil is death. This life and death are not limited to this body. To cultivate goodness without cease is to attain the Dao; on the day the Dao is attained, how can this not be life? Thus the scripture says "emerge." To commit evil without respite is to sink into hell—how can this not be death? Thus the scripture says "enter."

Therefore, lust, greed, and envious wrath—
Lust arises from the pursuit of form, hence it stands at the forefront of the thirteen. Lust may involve greed, but not all greed involves lust. Yet greed as a flaw is not limited to wealth and status; it extends to craving fame and worldly success. To resent others surpassing oneself is jealousy; to desire their superiority is envy. Wrath refers to true anger. When greed and envy arise, wrath naturally follows.

Deceit, theft, falsehood, and fraud—
To take things in violation of the precepts is deceit and theft, meaning to deceive the mind. To feign promises for a time is falsehood and fraud, employing cunning to gain advantage—what is called the bane of the people.

Flattering speech and double-tongued words—
Words that are false yet embellished are flattering speech. To reverse right and wrong is double-tongued speech. Both arise from deceit and fraud.

Flattery for profit and clinging to power—
To speak of calamities and omens, proclaiming fortune and misfortune, using humble words to extol others for personal gain—this is flattery. To rely on temporal authority to control others—this is clinging to power. The most extreme flattery extends to praying to spirits and sacrificing to ghosts to seek unjust protection.

Defilement and destruction of the Dharma—
The mixing of men and women without distinction is defilement. Destruction of the Dharma refers to the presence of such acts. Initially indulging in lust, it culminates in defilement—all arising sequentially. Such is not the conduct of the pure and faithful. Those who act thus hasten to the realm of death; if even the pure and faithful do not behave so, how much less should those who uphold the scriptures!

The net of Heaven does not fail—
This cites the scripture to clarify the matter. Though the net of Heaven is vast, the principle of karmic retribution never misses.

Life and death leave no refuge—
"Life" refers to witnessing retribution; "death" refers to facing judgment—there is no place to escape.

Having answered the question regarding the thirteen, what follows clarifies karmic retribution. Such people lack the capacity for wisdom. From ignorance arise all karmic offenses, thus they have no share in the Dharma. Defilement corrodes the Dharma, destroying good roots. The transmission of the Dharma is like a tree with roots—growth is unceasing; this is the good root. With such evil conduct, daily deepening defilement, how can the good root not be destroyed?

They are not known by those who do good.
Their conduct being evil, they associate with the wicked; the foolish and base naturally form their company. The good refer to those of superior talent, wisdom, and virtue.

They assume the bodies of sentient beings.
All this stems from past causes, lacking in wisdom and merit, thus in this life they are born foolish and dull. "Foolish and dull" refers to committing all manner of evil deeds, not to a lack of understanding.

Having no goodness in life, they fall into the three evil paths at death, assuming the bodies of sentient beings. Sentient beings are of myriad kinds, each receiving a body according to karmic retribution.

They sow the seeds of lust, with no aversion or avoidance.
The multitude of sentient beings arises from the propagation of lust. This refers to receiving such retribution due to past karmic actions—like chickens and dogs among humans, with no avoidance or preference, acting according to their kind, without hatred or love, all determined by past karma.

They are constantly filled with fear and dread.
This is the retribution for past greed and grasping. Among hungry ghosts, there are myriad types; though called hungry, some may occasionally be sated. Here, "unsated" means never having experienced fullness. In hell, the five pains are unceasing. Those in hell suffer torment with intervals of respite; "unceasing" means no rest at all. The five pains are the five sufferings—thus is the retribution of the three evil paths.

Assuming such bodies, they endure all manner of suffering and evil.
When the retribution of the three paths is exhausted, they are born among humans, yet their forms are incomplete, bearing all manner of disabilities—festering sores, scabies, leprosy, and the most repulsive afflictions.

They are despised by all beings—
Not only by humans, but even among animals, they are met with hatred and aversion.

Unattended and untended,
their afflictions so repulsive that none would heal them—
this is the retribution of defilement, arrogance, and frivolous dharma.

In the cycle of birth and death, they remain unhearing and unseeing:
*unhearing* means they do not believe in the teachings;
*unseeing* means they do not encounter good conditions.
This broadly clarifies the thirteen transgressions against the dharma—
the destinies of birth and death.

All arise from a single thought, multiplying into countless thoughts,
their consequences boundless.
For those who do evil, it begins with the first impulse.
