### **The One Hundred and Eighty Precepts of Lord Lao, with Preface**
In the late Zhou dynasty, during the reign of King Nan, the Dao of Great Peace and the teachings of Great Clarity first emerged. Lord Lao arrived at Langye and transmitted the Dao to Gan Jun. Gan Jun received the methods of the Dao, thereby attaining the Dao, and was appointed as a Perfected One. He was also transmitted the *Scripture of Great Peace* in one hundred seventy fascicles, divided into ten parts, *Jia* and *Yi*. Later, Bo Jun fell gravely ill, and from Gan Jun he received the Dao to protect against illness. His illness was cured, and he too attained the Dao, being appointed as a Perfected One. In Langye, there remains a magnolia tree, the place where Gan and Bo Jun practiced.

During the reign of King You, Lord Lao taught the Hu barbarians. On his return, he was to enter Hanzhong, passing through Langye, where Gan Jun was able to meet Lord Lao. Lord Lao said to Gan Jun: "Previously, I transmitted to you the methods to assist others and save lives, to worry for the myriad people, and to appoint male and female *jijiu* to broadly transform the foolish, distributing the seeds of the *lai* plant, so that above they might move the heart of Heaven, and below stir the will of Earth, thereby pleasing the hearts of kings. Yet from afar, across a thousand myriad *li*, I have observed that the various male and female *jijiu*, relying on the venerable position of Lord Lao, covet wealth and lust after beauty, act arbitrarily, and mutually dispute right and wrong. Each claims their own heart is correct and that others are not true, seeking offerings and desiring others to serve them. They hate and envy those of the same Dao, suppress the worthy and envy the talented, act arrogantly and self-indulgently, and forbid the common people from following others, saying, 'My Dao is the most correct; theirs is not true.' None of this should be so. Therefore, I have come to speak to you."

Gan Ji bowed his head, prostrated himself, and knocked his head on the ground a hundred times, replying: "From this day forward, may the Most High instruct us on how to absolve the grave transgressions of the various male and female *jijiu*, allowing the *jijiu* to live, and by the protection of the Dao, ascend as immortals. After their lifespans end, may they not enter the ninefold subterranean prisons of suffering. And not only the *jijiu*, but also the myriad people. The myriad people, ignorant of the laws, bear the sins of the *jijiu*—this is my transgression and fault, truly my own."

"May the Most High pardon past errors and appoint me to cultivate future goodness. Your servant Gan Ji is guilty of death, guilty of death!"

Lord Lao said: "Sit properly, calm your mind, and settle your thoughts. I fear that the Great Dao has become shallow in this degenerate age, and the myriad people are losing their lives. That one or two *jijiu* die and enter the ninefold darkness below is not what pains me. It is the suffering of the myriad people that pains me! You must listen well and commit this to heart, to establish laws for later generations, and to admonish the various male and female *jijiu* to change their past conduct and follow goodness from this day forward."

Lord Lao said: "Though a person may live for ten thousand years, if they do not uphold the precepts and rules, how are they different from an old, rotting tree or a crumbling stone? Better to uphold the precepts for a single day, die as a person of the Dao and virtue, and ascend as an immortal through *shijie*. When worldly people die bearing grave transgressions, it is of no benefit to their *hun* and *shen* spirits, which only suffer punishment! The *jijiu* must clearly follow and practice this."

Then he said: "Let the various *jijiu* listen clearly: Among the myriad people under Heaven, none endure forever. People are born and must die; things form and must decay. The sun rises and sets; the moon waxes and fills, then wanes. From ancient times until now, who has endured forever? Only the Dao and virtue can last! Today is good, this day is good, this hour is good, all the worthy are good, Master Jia is good, the disciples are good, the myriad spirits are all present, and the officers and soldiers have all arrived."

Now, for the sake of the various worthy ones, I consider the lives of the myriad people and thus accept the heavy precepts and strict prohibitions of Master Wang Jia.

The Most High Lord Lao said: Though a person may live ten thousand years, without upholding the precepts and disciplines, how do they differ from tiles and stones? Better to uphold the precepts for a single day, spend one’s life as a person of the Dao and virtue, and die without committing evil. Those who die upholding the precepts will extinguish delusion, refine their form, ascend to fill the celestial offices, and ascend as immortals through *shijie*. Worldly people who do not uphold the precepts die bearing grave transgressions, bringing no benefit to their *hun* and *shen* spirits. Good men and good women, clearly follow and practice these.

The disciples bowed their heads, prostrated themselves, and received the command.
