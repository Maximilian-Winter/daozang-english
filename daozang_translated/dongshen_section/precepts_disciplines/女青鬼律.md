**Nüqing Ghost Statutes**

**Sutra Title:** *Nüqing Ghost Statutes*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Wei-Jin and Northern and Southern Dynasties period. Originally in eight scrolls, six scrolls remain extant. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, Precepts and Statutes category.

**Nüqing Ghost Statutes, Scroll One**

The Statutes state: When Heaven and Earth first came into being, primordial *qi* flowed forth, and the myriad spirits distributed *qi*. There were no ghosts of ugliness, rebellion, perversity, or evil—no unrighteousness. Sons were filial, daughters chaste; rulers observed propriety, ministers were loyal. The Six Directions were as one, and there was no suffering or harm.

After the era of the Heavenly Sovereign Yuan, myriad cunning arose. The Great Dao was not believed in; the Five Directions turned to slaughter, and pestilential *qi* gradually arose. Tigers, wolves, and the ten thousand beasts grew large by receiving *qi*; the hundred insects, snakes, and specters multiplied daily. Heaven has sixty days, and each day has one spirit. The spirit presiding over a day allows a thousand ghosts to fly about, unrestrained. The Great Dao did not forbid it; the Heavenly Master did not command it. Thus, the world was left to chaos, with calamities chasing one another. Only in the midst of slaughter were the common people afflicted, and the dead numbered in the hundreds of millions.

The Most High Great Dao could not bear to witness this. On the seventh day of the seventh month in the second year, at noon, these *Ghost Statutes* in eight scrolls descended, recording the arts of the names and fortunes of the ghosts and spirits under Heaven. They were commanded to the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling, ordering him to restrain the ghosts and spirits, preventing them from recklessly moving east, west, south, or north.

If later generations of Daoist men and women encounter this esoteric scripture and know the names of the ghosts to be auspicious, the ten thousand ghosts will not intrude, and the thousand spirits will submit in reverence. Those who uphold and practice these statutes must not recklessly transmit them to unworthy persons. If transmitted to the unworthy, calamity will flow for seven generations—do not blame the Dao for fault.

The above sixty ghosts of the sixty Jiazi days, each with distinct forms, red hair and black garments, ears but no eyes, fly a thousand *li*, their bodies threefold. They slay the treacherous and unfilial, harming the people of heaven. If one recalls their names according to the day, the ghosts dare not approach.

Every ten days of Jiazi form a *xun*: the inauspicious spirit of the Jiazi *xun* is surnamed Xuan, named Yuheng. The Jiaxu *xun*’s inauspicious spirit is surnamed He, named Peng. The Jiashen *xun*’s inauspicious spirit is surnamed Ji, named Ying. The pronunciation of *ying* is *ying*. The Jiawu *xun*’s inauspicious spirit is surnamed Ben, named Man.

The above six Jia spirits are the inauspicious and malevolent lords of killing. People born into the world are not granted a hundred years of life; morning does not guarantee evening, and death outnumbers life. The treacherous killing ghosts pervade the human realm, deceitfully manifesting as myriad illnesses. The five rebellious *qi* cause chills and fever, headaches, or abdominal masses, vomiting, shortness of breath, distension of the five viscera, inverted vision, locked jaw, contracted limbs, and loss of self-awareness, with life hanging by a thread as the malevolent ghosts draw near.

Men and women under heaven, you may consult my charts to know the names of these ghosts, then apply my talisman of the Great Mystery, invoking the generative *qi* of the Three Heavens, the life of the three, five, seven, and nine, to bestow upon the people of heaven—so that those who die may live again. Since the Great Beginning, I have witnessed men and women deceived by cunning ghosts, disbelieving in my truth, and thus I concealed this scripture, for the dead are beyond count. Grieving for them, I now reissue these statutes and commands, revealing the names, garments, colors, and heights of the ghosts and spirits under heaven. Know the statutes, align with the *qi* of the Orthodox Unity, and by recalling the names of the day, ten thousand ghosts will not dare to interfere. If you remain ignorant, claiming no spirit within, you will incur the resentment of the Great Dao above and blame from others below. You will harm yourself; be cautious in the years of the Three-Five. You will see those under heaven who disbelieve in the true *qi* and mock it, even consorting with ghosts. Reflect and discern: how can you hope to live today? Think thrice, do not transgress, and be vigilant.

The statutes say: The Dao of Heaven employs ghosts to assist the spirits in deploying *qi*. People fear ghosts but not spirits, so ghosts falsely assume their names and titles. Hearing that ghosts possess primordial spirit, people heed their words a hundredfold. Thus, the regulation of yin and yang, the purification of body and mind, and the absence of depravity can restrain ghosts. The thirty-six thousand and more spirits under heaven are all at your command. If your person is not upright, you will suffer their calamities—consider whether you prosper.

The Northern Dipper governs killing, the Southern Dipper bestows life. Killing is the heavenly net, life is the Three Terraces. As with the human body, above it corresponds to heaven and earth, modeled on the sun and moon. The Dao is not distant; the Three-Five returns in cycles—how precious this is! Among the scattered people under heaven, those who are filial, loyal, and trustworthy may inscribe the names of the sixty-day ghosts, place them in a black pouch, and on the first day of the first month at noon, personally visit a master’s abode to receive them. Fasten the pouch to your left or right arm, and as you come and go, ghosts will not dare to interfere.

Under heaven at peace, return them to their original governance. When traveling by night and fearing encounter with evil, you may recite their ghostly names—ghosts will not dare confront you. People remain unaware that ghosts and spirits govern themselves; those who go about unprotected suffer calamity, failing to grasp the proper way. Through the cycles of three and six years, you will perish of your own accord.

**Nüqing Guilu, Scroll Two**

The Supreme Laws of the Three Heavens of Great Clarity and Primordial Origin now command the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water: when heaven first came into being, only the divine was revered. In this benighted age, chaos and perversion abound; true spirits are unseen, and only ghosts confound humankind. Now we shall record the names of ghosts and establish the Three-Five spirits to govern them.

Herein are set forth the names of mountain and sea ghosts from the second scroll. Wear them for three years, and ten thousand ghosts will not dare confront you. As you come and go, you will master and subdue demonic forces.

The statutes say: in a single lifetime under heaven, there are a thousand myriad ghosts—ever more distant from the divine, ever closer to the demonic. Under heaven’s turmoil, they cannot be known. Those who suffer misfortune and meet death number in the thousands and tens of thousands, yet the ghosts do not cease. Now their true names are recorded so that people may know them. Once you know a ghost’s name, evil will not dare approach. Call its name thrice, and the ghost’s *qi* is severed; heavenly ghosts descend, earthly ghosts are slain together. All ghosts have names—know the names of the Three Terraces’ ghosts, and the ten thousand ghosts will be at your command.

The statutes say: When the human body suffers illness, distress, or urgent calamity, the master may employ talismans to summon the names of ghost-slaying spirits and apply the method of subduing ghosts. If a household’s misfortunes and ailments persist, place a talisman facing north in the central courtyard upon the day’s celestial stem, grasp the Celestial Pass with the left hand and the Fire Phase with the right, and recite the incantation thrice: *"Heavenly One, Lady Green, slay the ghost—ten thousand thousand, Great One, Nine Qi, seize the demonic spirits and ghosts. Death spirits, Perfect Dao, seek the boundless—chichichi!"* Then turn right toward the Heavenly Gate and hold the breath for twenty-four cycles. Upon resuming breath, face the Earthly Portal and recite thrice: *"Great One commands me to slay the myriad ghosts—ghosts depart, spirits arrive!"* Perform this urgently three times, and the hundred demons will instantly appear before and behind you. The gods will escort the celestial net, hastening the interrogation of all ghosts, leaving none to escape. This may be used to heal the body, but do not recklessly show it to the uninitiated.

The ghost of Great Harmony has no body but possesses a head. Its head is three feet long, its eyes three inches wide, its ears seven inches broad, its brows five inches wide, its mouth three inches across, its nose two inches large, its beard three feet long, and its hair ten feet long. It inhales the *qi* of heaven and exhales it as clouds. If you encounter it while traveling, its name is Zibei—call it thrice, and its form will manifest, and all accompanying ghosts will submit. When traveling, do not carry gold or coins on your person, for their radiant *qi* will cause ghosts to flee upon seeing them. If coins are on you, ghosts will know you understand their concealment. Should you encounter one while traveling by water, call out Hefen, for it is also a water ghost, capable of transforming into the shape of a crow, bright as a raven. Slay it, but tell no one. After three years of such practice, you may traverse mountains and seas without fear—greatly auspicious.

**Daoist Precepts and Prohibitions**

The Heavenly Master declares: Behold the men and women of the world—daily they act without loyalty, and though they perform good deeds, no reward comes. Disasters and calamities arise day by day. Heaven examines the ghostly thieves, and the Five Poisons spread unchecked, all born of disbelief and neglect. Those who guard the One and practice virtue bring misfortune upon themselves; you shall not attain long life in this world. I have received the stern command of the Most High to reveal this to the people of heaven, that they may know the prohibitions and not transgress the divine statutes of the *Nüqing Xuan Du Ghost Statutes*. Let all of you hear and understand: the rebellious shall return to obedience, the wicked to goodness. Reform the past and cultivate the future—abide by these ghostly statutes.

1. You shall not, whether going east or west, south or north, depart or return without reporting your going or announcing your return, following your own will without restraint. All such acts violate the statutes, and thirty-two years shall be deducted from your lifespan.

2. You shall not invoke heaven as though it were godless, nor speak of the Daoist master’s decrees to disrupt governance and sow disorder. To claim yourself a Daoist while speaking falsehoods violates the ghostly statutes, and thirteen years shall be deducted from your lifespan by heaven.

3. You shall not mingle truth with falsehood, nor disrupt the sagely and enlightened with lewdness. You shall not drink wine, eat meat, or rail against the Dao, lest one thousand three hundred years be deducted from your lifespan.

4. You shall not spread malicious words, slander others, or fabricate teachings without faith in the heavenly Dao. To speak emptily of what is without substance shall cost you one thousand two hundred years of your lifespan.

5. You shall not engage in duplicity, falsehood, or capricious anger, nor persist in rebellion and slaughter without heeding the balance of yin and yang. Heaven shall deduct one hundred thirty-two years from your lifespan.

6. You shall not disrespect the elderly, curse your kin, or invoke curses between husband and wife, nor harm one another with venomous intent. To commit the Five Iniquities of unfilial conduct shall cost you one hundred eighty years of your lifespan.

7. You shall not, upon receiving the Dao, act with disdain, nor transmit it to the unworthy. You shall not covet wealth or profit at others’ expense, nor borrow without repayment, treating others’ possessions as your own. Heaven shall deduct one thousand eight hundred years from your lifespan.

8. You shall not engage in quarrelsome speech, nor indulge in drunkenness and lust under the pretext of the Great Dao. You shall not utter ghostly words to entangle men and women, nor drink wine or eat meat during the hours of yin. Three hundred years shall be deducted from your lifespan.

9. You shall not wander east and west, entangling men and women, nor fail to resolve calamities, thereby fostering perverse disorder. Heaven shall deduct thirteen thousand years from your lifespan, and the misfortune shall flow through seven generations.

10. You shall not transmit the Dao to maidens, nor enter the Gate of Life to harm the spirit and violate *qi*. To act with perverse wickedness shall bring death without descendants. You shall not reverse male and female, inverting yin and yang, lest three hundred years be deducted from your lifespan.

11. You shall not expose the union of yin and yang, offending the Three Luminaries. To engage in such acts under the influence of wine, yielding to lustful contact, shall cost you three hundred years of your lifespan.

12. You shall not cause one’s *qi* to live while another’s *qi* dies, nor coerce a Perfected One. Heaven shall deduct thirty-three years from your lifespan.

13. You shall not cause father and son to dwell apart, nor scatter the household. Heaven shall deduct twenty-two years from your lifespan.

14. You shall not indulge in excessive desires and depravity, nor gather men and women to spread perverse and heretical words. Heaven shall deduct one hundred twenty years from your lifespan.

15. You shall not, among those of the same teaching, slander one another, nor speak of the Dao without faith in the Three and Five. To debate the length of heaven’s *qi* shall cost you eight hundred twenty-three years of your lifespan.

16. You shall not flee from your parents to wander the four directions, nor stand in the position of true *qi* to gather and unite with others. Heaven shall deduct three hundred twenty years from your lifespan.

17. You shall not destroy what heaven has begotten, nor recklessly slay beasts, shoot flying birds, or reverse south and north, following your own will without adhering to the ghostly statutes. Heaven shall deduct three thousand years from your lifespan.

18. You shall not pry into others’ affairs, nor expose the secrets of households. You shall not conceal goodness and reveal evil, nor seduce others’ wives or scheme against their husbands. To rebel against the Three Luminaries, secretly harm others, or invoke curses—committing the Five Iniquities of unfilial conduct—shall cost you one thousand two hundred twenty years of your lifespan.

19. On the day you practice the Dao, you shall not indulge in lustful thoughts. Though your *qi* may grow long, you shall not indulge yourself, nor make private vows, thereby fostering unfilial conduct. With a heart of perversity and no Dao within, you are a child without the Way. Heaven shall deduct thirty thousand years from your lifespan.

20. You shall not, while contemplating the spirits, fail to receive their response, nor generate *qi* through practice only to draw down primordial *qi* for lustful indulgence. To cling to desire and love of form, never parting hand from foot, day and night without cease—such is the way of the faithless. Heaven shall deduct three hundred forty-two years from your lifespan.

21. You shall not recklessly transmit the Red *Qi* to the uninitiated, nor engage in contact of mouth, hand, chest, or heart. To forsake the Dao and betray your master, leaving the teaching without method, shall cost you three hundred years of your lifespan.

22. You shall not recklessly transmit scriptures to the uninitiated, nor reveal the names and taboos of Daoist parents, nor leak essential secrets to the profane. Heaven shall deduct three hundred years from your lifespan.

The Heavenly Master declares: I have received the command of the Most High, and the prohibitions are most severe. Yet you, men and women, have lived in confusion from birth to this day, unaware of the restrictions, creating your own teachings in defiance of heaven. When the Examiner arrives, heaven shall deduct your allotted years, and you shall know bitter sorrow, never beholding the Great Peace.

Those who live as libationers and Daoist priests, spreading transformation with merit, may redeem transgressions through their deeds. If the people do not heed this, yet you possess the heart to spread transformation, you may reform the past and cultivate the future, focusing solely on nurturing your nature. Thus, you may transcend the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations of heaven.

You, who persist in evil and rebellion, forsaking loyalty and filial piety—fear for your years and life, which you cannot preserve. I grieve for you, and thus I earnestly exhort you again and again.

The Heavenly Master declares: Men and women of the world, upon seeing these admonitions of goodness, fail to follow them, instead pursuing their own desires. They teach others to act wrongly, engaging in slander and spreading the teachings of ghosts.

The young and old rush headlong into fleeting worldly pleasures—these are the axes that hew at the body, the halberds that destroy life, joys of a single moment that bring a thousand years of disaster. You who already know the Dao, and you who do not yet know it: upon seeing these ghostly statutes, both new and old regulations, you may all follow and apply them. On the days of three, five, seven, and nine, take care to practice the cultivation of generative qi. If you adhere to my diagrams and avoid violating the Three Qi, you may attain transcendence and transform a thousand people. Those who do not know the true names of their father and mother remain common folk. Daoist priests who know the Yellow Writs and covenants yet do not know the Twenty-Four Divine Persons are but false practitioners. The Dao’s ultimate reckoning is complete; heaven possesses its Three and Five, yet you remain ignorant—how then can you claim the Dao is not divine? If you do not know the Dao, how can you say the qi is not luminous?

Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once. Why do you not transform your heart and renew your innards, entering into the generative qi of my Way? Then you may become a true person, and on the day of Great Peace, ascend to heaven in flight. If you still do not ascend, yet your lifespan does not end in death, you shall become an earthbound immortal and witness the Great Peace. Day by day, you grow ever more vexed and troubled, disbelieving and disloyal, practicing only what is contrary to the Dao. You shall not see the Great Peace. I grieve for you—what more can I do?

The Heavenly Master declares: Men and women of the world, you already know the great Dao of long life on the days of three, five, seven, and nine, yet you do not follow my methods, instead engaging in evil, lewdness, and disorder. I fear you shall perish before the wicked. I earnestly admonish you once more—ponder this well.

The Heavenly Master declares: Practice restraint and follow the Dao. Be diligent in observing the regulations. Let your eyes not gaze recklessly, your mouth not speak recklessly, your heart not harbor reckless thoughts, your feet not wander recklessly. Draw near to the good and distance yourself from evil. Harmonize with the spontaneity of the body, and thus there shall be no need for repeated instruction. Reflect upon this carefully.

*End of Scroll Three of the Nüqing Guilu*
*Beginning of Scroll Four of the Nüqing Guilu*

The Heavenly Master bows his head, reverently upholding the Dao of the former kings, governing the people and restraining ghosts. Now, with the qi of the Alliance’s Might and Orthodox Unity, and the Nüqing Guilu, he commands all demonic and spectral beings of the world, assisting the Dao in its flourishing transformation. He carves the true names of ghosts, and those in authority must strictly enforce them, so that the Dao’s qi may spread throughout the world, and rebellious spirits submit as guests. If you know the names of ghosts, they shall flee of their own accord and dare not harm people. Keep this always in mind, and do not violate it.

**General of the Dao’s Upper Army: named Houfu.**

**General of the Dao’s Lower Army: named Yiche.**
**Heavenly Rebel Ghost: named Wenyanxuan.**
**Earthly Rebel Ghost: named Jingzi.**

The four ghosts above govern wind and rain, causing harm to people as they follow the seasons. When traveling on roads and encountering great wind and rain, call out the names of these four ghosts, and evil qi will not dare to afflict you.

**Ancient Ominous Ghost: named Jinzhongshi.**
**Rebel Ghost: named Nonger Zilanluan.**

The two ghosts above are the spirits of ancient corpses in ruined tombs, or the ghosts of shamans and unorthodox Daoist masters. They inflict harm upon people in a hundred ways. If you know their names, the ghosts will submit and remain still, daring not to move.

**Heavenly Upright Ghost: named Dieshe Diedajie.**
**Earthly Upright Ghost: named Xinmu (Xin pronounced as *qin*).**

The two ghosts above are the death-bringing guardian ghosts of houses, dwelling constantly upon the beams of people’s halls. At night, they harm people, chickens, dogs, and the six livestock. If you know their names, the ghosts will submit and dare not move. These ghosts do not dare harm people; in households with virtue and power, they instead protect against external misfortune and calamities, preventing them from entering the home.

**Shenjiunian**
**Hou Mugao**

The two ghosts above appear when people build houses without matching the color of the pillars to the ridgepole. If seen at dawn or dusk, or under the light of stars and the moon, they possess spirits that bring harm and turn people into rebels. If you know their names, the ghosts will not harm people.

**Lingjinghua**
**Shi Buzuo**

The two ghosts above are the spirits of bronze and gold coins in people’s homes. They manifest as these ghosts, sometimes transforming into human form, causing unrest in the household. Call out to them, and they will depart.

**Yibagen**
**Shegu**
**Yinjiu**

The three ghosts above dwell in the four corners of the walls within people’s homes. They appear when the master and mistress of the house lack the Dao, failing to follow the harmony of yin and yang. These ghosts serve as *baizhifu* (white straight talismans), and the *baizhifu* report matters to remove people’s names from the register of the living. If you know their names, the ghosts will not dare to move. Command the ghosts to be suppressed in the four corners of the house by writing with cinnabar on a peachwood thorn twelve inches long, and hang it above the door. The method of command is as follows:

This talisman is governed by the Azure Dragon in the east, the White Tiger in the west, the Vermilion Bird in the south, the Dark Warrior in the north, and the Yellow Qilin in the center. It repels demonic thieves. *Hastily, hasten as the statutes command!*

This talisman controls a hundred ghosts.

**Tianzai**
**Miexiang (Mie pronounced as *e*, Xiang as *zhu*)**

The two ghosts above are the *menbo* (gate elders) and *hucheng* (door guardians). By day, they serve as divine protectors of the household; by night, they become ghosts. If you know their names, at the hour of *ren ding* (9–11 p.m.), call out their names to the left and right of the door, clap your hands three times, turn your head away, and hold the gesture two or three times—these ghosts will then cease and dare not cause harm.

**Fujinmu**
**Hekaikangcu**

The two ghosts above dwell in trees or bamboo groves on people’s properties, where crows, turtledoves, egrets, and flocks of birds perch. All such places harbor demonic influences. If you know their names, call out to them three times every evening. The ghosts will realize they cannot overpower you and, within seven to nine days, will die of their own accord. If they do not die, they will often blow in the dark, submitting and no longer harming people.

**Zigan Fangzhuan (Gan pronounced as *ju*, Zhuan as *zhuan*).**
**Taishun (Shun pronounced as *shen*).**
**Chenfa**

The three ghosts above are the world’s ghosts that afflict people with epilepsy. They wear red clothing and black headscarves and are responsible for seizing people’s souls. If you know their names and are ill, you will recover immediately, and the ghosts will not dare to interfere.

**Sanghuazai**
**Biqitu Fu**

The two ghosts above are the essences of women’s menstrual blood. Ghosts often crave the taste of yin-yang blood. When a woman’s menstruation arrives, visualize them day and night and call out their names—the ghosts will not dare to harm people. These ghosts are three feet tall and wear blue clothing from head to toe.

**Yuji (Ji pronounced as *bi*)**
**Jingzao (Zao pronounced as *ni*)**

The two ghosts above are the ghosts that attend women during childbirth. When a woman is giving birth, call out the names of these ghosts, and they will not harm her. These ghosts are three inches and three-tenths tall and wear black clothing from head to toe.

**Xujinghua**

This ghost harms people’s fields and silkworms—it is the Silkworm Maiden Ghost. On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) at dawn, face the Gate of Heaven and recite the following incantation three times:

*"Radiant and pure is the August Heaven,*
*Vast and eternal, filled with many spirits.*
*Yin does not reach you—*
*Ma Gu, come to my home,*
*Let silkworms multiply a thousand ten-thousandfold,*
*And fields yield a thousand billion bushels.*
*Contemplate the upper and lower of Heaven,*
*The upper and middle of Earth,*
*And the great Dao that abides.*
*Command Hua to serve me, rebuke and expel!*
*Hasten to slay a hundred harms,*
*What can petty demons do, howling like wolves?"*

**Jinjin (Jin pronounced as *xiao*, the second character as *li*)**

This ghost is the Sweeping Ghost of dawn and dusk, causing people to lose their wealth. If you know its name, at dawn each day, face the Gate of Heaven and call out its name three times, reciting the following incantation:

*"Stone Unborn, Stone Unborn,*
*Taiyi commands you to serve me.*
*What demon dares oppose?*
*Make it swiftly depart, swiftly depart!"*

The Dao thus commands all men and women under Heaven to receive the Dao, ponder the true essentials of the oral instructions, and hold them forth to their descendants. You may thereby visualize the divine luminaries and, with truth, dispel the demonic. Within these eight scrolls, the fourth scroll is the most authentic and can deliver the world. Do not violate or transgress it—be cautious.

The Heavenly Master commands: Within the *Lü* (Statutes) of the *Nüqing*, ghosts dare not disobey. Flying talismans connect to Heaven, the One Origin and Three Spirits—this is the essential method of the Heavenly Master’s own body and its divine ghosts. *"Keep soldiers at a distance! The Great King governs the Origin, the One, the Nine, and the Three Qi. The Elder of the Nine Qi, the Father and Mother Taiyi, command me to gather the slayers—come forth at once!"* After a long pause, bow three times and recite the *chi* (rebuke) twenty-four times in a low voice.

The above is the Heavenly Master’s command to the great demon of water—ghosts will not dare to harm people.

*End of Scroll Four of the Nüqing Guilu*
*Beginning of Scroll Five of the Nüqing Guilu*

The Dao says: The world is in turmoil, ever like floating clouds. Rulers plot against their ministers, wives scheme against their husbands. Mars and Venus transform into humans, lingering near children with deceitful words. They weave webs of falsehood and treachery, choking the throats of the young so they cannot swallow. They spread rumors along the roads, whispering that you will die within the year. First, there is great joy, then terror—such is the turning of Heaven and Earth’s fate.

Those entrusted with leadership must ensure diligence, ever guarding the One to cultivate eternal existence. Do not indulge the heart’s whims, nor abandon the Three and Five to pursue depravity. Though the great Dao of Heaven imposes no prohibitions, the Three Offices’ overseers select the *zhongmin* (seed people). Those who harmonize with *qi* number eighteen thousand—how many have endured from ancient times to now? Before your allotted span is complete, refine your body, transform your heart and bowels, and become a true person of the Dao. The master transmits oral instructions to reveal the worthy; wearing my contract and seal takes precedence. Should you meet the Perfected Lords of Great Peace and the Immortal Sages, the Five Emperors’ overseers will impart secret teachings. The Three, Five, Seven, and Nine—revered *qi* of the Dao—are governed in the pure subtlety of Kunlun Mountain. Recently, the Three Heavens have entered the human body, unraveling the snares of the net to bow before the Venerable Lord. Calm the heart, settle the intent, and walk the path to immortality; whether long or short, do not falter halfway. You may reach the covenant by contemplating the *yuanchen* (primordial cyclical signs); the cycles of Seven and Nine distinguish the true person.

The people of the world are stubborn and foolish, seeing the age’s turmoil yet unaware of sorrow. Cold ghosts come to wander with you, while Venus traverses the heavens, its six red trails stretching long. Old men on the roads support one another, hunger gnawing at their cheeks as they bow their heads in supplication. Grain and gold grow scarce and unattainable; calamity, warfare, and great peril arrive in the *gengzi* year. Consider your fate bound to this destiny—beyond the frontier, in distant prefectures, the Hu and Yi barbarians, their necks swollen and throats inflamed, are a rebellious people. Born of noxious winds and poisons, they serve Heaven in body. Great and small alike come to this land; I possess Hu ghosts by the hundreds of millions. They feed on human blood and essence, their hair bristling in defiance—why have they entered your realm? The chaos of armies and horses defies description. Should you be linked to them even for a day, you will find no forward step, your limbs stiffening and stretching uncontrollably. If you doubt the *gengzi* year, reflect on my words today. Sun and moon may darken, their light lost; the five grains will fail to grow as perverse ghosts roam. In this *gengzi* year, few will escape annihilation—if any remain, they will swarm like flying wasps. Great and small will follow one another, the Three and Five uniting in pairs. Should you fail to encounter this fate, you will perish before the year arrives. Not one in a hundred will survive—what recourse remains? Heaven and sun, moon and earth, will be reborn. Only in the Great Peace below will the *zhongmin* in Heaven behold their mother. If you disbelieve the great Dao, consider these words: is it not filial piety that sustains the Dao? How can one speak of such a day? Why not study a little and attain the immortals? Crossing the threshold of Great Peace, you become a true person, sun and moon arrayed like streaming stars. The Three, Five, Seven, and Nine—Dao’s luminous and dark *qi*—are distributed across the Nine Provinces like brothers. All share one contract, their hearts united, each following the Dao’s guiding scriptures. The great essentials of yellow and red guard long life; the upper register’s supreme purple tallies the human count. The myriad’s reckoning unites with the divine spirits; feigning foolishness and silence, they preserve the Three Ones in accordance with the Dao’s scriptures. Though a thousand shadows obscure, clarity emerges in action. The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, yet its truth endures; day follows night, and Heaven and Earth abide. Take the sun as husband and the moon as wife—how does their *qi* commingle? The divine mausoleum of the great mountain shelters the spirits; witnessing the primordial transformation, they dwell without fixed abode. Hands bound in sincerity, they do not relax their vigilance, transcending the teachings of kings to embrace the Dao.

Within the Northern Dipper resides the Great White Star, its three points vast and luminous, resembling a human form. It roams the world, transforming discord into harmony—those who know awaken, while the ignorant tremble. Who rectifies this Dao and bears a name? The Wooden Child and the Three Terraces ever accompany it. The covenant awaits the great assembly when the world is at peace; the Five Phases array themselves, metal and wood born, fire and water as parents, earth as the encampment. The Dao emerges from primordial *qi*, following the ancient scriptures. The inner and outer luminous spirits manifest their true forms, weaving the purple loom to ascend the Heavenly Court. Gazing toward the eight extremities, one ascends the Grand Clarity; the number sixty-four arises from the One. If your heart does not comprehend, your mouth may speak the names—Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang place humanity first. The five viscera and bones harbor spirits; those who delight in long life all become flying immortals. Dispel great calamities and avert disasters; know a little of the Three and Five to govern the body. Long practice of the Seven and Nine refines *qi*’s divisions; crossing into Great Peace, you become *zhongmin*. The men and women of the world gather like clouds, assembling before the Perfected of the Great One and the Immortal Dao. After three days without hesitation, they return; one heart, two mouths, they ascend in resonance with Heaven. Your long life emerges from your heart; the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine unite as kin. Only the great *qi* of rectitude makes one *zhongmin*, liberating the body’s gods from the snares of the net. Ascending in broad daylight to the Heavenly Hall, one emerges after a thousand years, a body sixteen *zhang* tall. The Five Marchmounts and Four Seas issue from the Nine Provinces, merging into an ocean that ceases to flow.

Thus emerges the *Nüqing Guilu*; how joyful is its transmission throughout the world! The wise will come of their own accord to seek the true companions; the foolish will depart to dwell on Mount Tai. White bones lie scattered, ghosts lurking in darkness, their wails unceasing—what can I do? Immortal youths and jade maidens dwell with the spirits; how should they regard such beings? The world’s true decline is imminent; the *gengzi* year’s fate approaches. Not one in a thousand will escape—only those with resolve will meet an age of clarity. Shun evil, pursue goodness without seeking glory; dust-stained robes may yet clothe the form. The heart abides in the Great One, chanting scriptures; by day cultivate goodness, by night preserve life. Let your hair flow unbound as you walk the Yellow Court, invoking the Supreme Lord’s Dao and name. Emerging from the Mysterious Capital to enter the Grand Clarity, you receive esoteric instructions to transcend calamities. Foolish worldly children know not life—when will they unite with the perverse spirits? The Great One descends to record names, fearing your body will not long endure. Vow not to die, and follow my scriptures.

The Heavenly Master says: The great Dao bestows its precepts, transmitted by Nüqing—the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine are the root of long life. [Respectfully] uphold and practice them, passing them down through the generations. If you possess a heart and share in my *qi*, you must reflect on practicing benevolence and righteousness, guarding loyalty across the Six Directions, focusing on nurturing your nature, and taking the Dao as your home. Do not betray or transgress. The true words of the Supreme Lord, the Master, and the Great One: Thus, on the seventh day of the first month of the first year, we put this into practice. Among a thousand followers, Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng were the two who could be transformed and guided by the Dao’s *qi*, enabling them to fully attain the great principle of long life.

Do not offend the spirits of men and women. Do not invoke heaven or summon earth. Do not sacrifice to stale *qi*. Do not point at ghosts or call upon spirits. Do not indulge in lust or act with disrespect. Do not speak of *qi* with obscurity. Do not harbor dual minds or crooked intentions. Do not recklessly transmit demonic teachings. Do not violate the Five Spirits or the Seven Governors. Do not collude with ghosts. Do not disrupt the divine order. Do not let the profane overcome the sacred. Do not come or go without restraint. In haste or distress, do not wail and beseech ghosts and spirits.

*End of Scroll Five of the Nüqing Demon Statutes*
*Scroll Six of the Nüqing Demon Statutes begins*

The Heavenly Master says: In recent years, yin and yang have fallen out of harmony, water and drought have been unseasonable, and disasters and omens have repeatedly appeared—all due to human affairs losing their proper order.

Humans, as beings of middling capacity, emulate earth to follow heaven, moving and resting in accord with the seasons, communicating without contention, benefiting without harm. Thus can they attain the state of divine transcendence. Yet in this degenerate age, the Dao is abandoned, and people frantically vie for self-interest. They defy heaven and earth, oppose and betray their masters and elders. Hierarchies blur, superiors and inferiors grow estranged. Good and evil are indistinguishable, and the worthy withdraw into obscurity. The state lacks loyal ministers; loyalty and benevolence are forsaken. Laws and decrees go unenforced; deceit and fraud prevail. Bandits and rebels fill the land, bringing humiliation to the Central Kingdom. The myriad people scatter, suffering from famine and cold. Half perish, and nine out of ten are wounded. How grievous! How grievous!

Chaos cannot endure. The ravenous must be eradicated. The Dao’s fortune is set to rise, and the era of Great Peace draws near. Now is the time to drive out the wicked and preserve the good seed of humanity. All libationers, men and women, and every living person must swiftly verify and examine one another, seeking out the loyal and worthy who revere and cherish the Dao. Those who are naturally inclined toward virtue are few; diligent supervision is required. If one can reform their errors, they shall be counted among the meritorious.

Among people, there is no distinction of high or low, no adherence to noble or base. Only evil is to be regarded as true, and no private embellishments are permitted. Those who are nominated but prove unworthy, or who are unjust, shall be punished accordingly, with no hope of long life.

Kings, lords, governors, and all officials—if you heed my words, promote the good and instruct the people, exhorting those who cannot reform, replacing punishments with benevolence—then the libationers shall record your deeds and submit them to heaven. Those who labor shall receive manifest rewards and ascend to the ranks of divine transcendents. But those who lack sincerity, shirk their duties, or avoid committing their names to the practice of goodness shall be deemed wicked and cast out. The records of the upright shall be precise, without the slightest deviation.

When the common people delight in goodness and are counted among the virtuous, they shall return to their native villages to bring peace to the land. When all people cultivate goodness, the world shall attain Great Peace. Calamities and rebellions shall cease, and disasters shall no longer arise. How joyous! How joyous!

Now I dispatch the Five Lords, each leading ten thousand ghosts, to spread across the land and execute the wicked. Those slain shall not be called mad, nor shall they be recklessly spared upon investigation. If ghosts err and wrongly afflict the virtuous, their lords shall absolve and protect them. If ghosts refuse to depart, they shall be strictly seized and punished. Reward the good and punish the evil, clearly adhering to the statutes of the Dao.

The Lord of the Eastern Blue *Qi* is surnamed Liu, named Yuan Da. He commands ten thousand ghosts, spreading diseases of malignant winds.

At the year’s beginning, they file memorials, listing names to sever their power. All ghosts fear and tremble, fleeing of their own accord. Those who do not petition shall be bound by this ordinance.
