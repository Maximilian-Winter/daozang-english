**Fascicle One**

**Method for Nurturing Cinnabar with Arsenic in a Sealed Vessel**

Take half a catty of pure, stone-free arsenic, crushed to the size of mung beans—this is best. Divide into portions of two taels each, wrap in white paper, and place inside a coarse cloth bag.

Harvest *xiaku* grass in season, dry it in the sun, burn to ash, and steep in boiling water to extract a thick infusion. Suspend the infusion in a porcelain jar with a false bottom and boil. Frequently replenish the liquid. After five or six days, the cloth bag will gradually lighten as the infusion thickens. Test over fire: if smoke appears, the process is complete.

Then boil the medicine in the infusion. By the seventh or eighth day, the medicine will dissolve into the liquid. If a small residue remains, it is merely mineral dregs—no need to consume it entirely.

Transfer the medicinal infusion to another jar and simmer slowly until it dries into a dark brown mass—this is the "subdued" state. Dry thoroughly over a slow fire, ensuring no moisture remains, then place in the crucible, seal tightly, and set in an ash basin. Apply a top fire of one and a half taels, positioned one and a half *cun* away, and nurture for three days. Gradually increase to two taels and nurture for three seven-day periods.

Inspect the sealed vessel—if undisturbed, continue nurturing until the thirty-fifth day. Upon opening, if the contents appear ashen white with a watery sheen on top, the elixir is complete. Test by burning: if smoke persists, the spirit has not yet departed. Crush with an iron spoon, add milk, reseal, and nurture for another month.

Upon reopening, if the elixir is yellow and gradually dries without moisture, burn again over fire. If it melts without smoke, the death is complete—but not yet true death. Repeat the previous method, sealing and nurturing for another month. When the medicine becomes white and lustrous, burning like stone without melting, it has truly died. The frost-like ash has been nurtured away, leaving only the pure, dead essence of the mineral.

Crush into rice-sized grains for storage. This method is peerless—no other compares. The oral instructions and manual techniques are all herein.

**Method for Boiling and Nurturing Cinnabar**

Take two taels of fine cinnabar, pound with *yuxing* grass and rice vinegar to extract the juice, and boil in a suspended vessel for seven *fu* periods. Remove, wrap the cinnabar in coarse grass, place in a sealed vessel or jar, and seal tightly. Apply a slow fire for one firing cycle. Alternatively, use a water jar beneath—this is even better.

Take the cinnabar, pound with the aforementioned coarse grass to form a storage vessel, place one tael inside, and nurture with top fire aligned to the *mao* and *you* directions for three *fu* periods. Remove, wrap the cinnabar in *Kunlun* paper, attach dead alum to the body, place in the mother vessel, and seal for nurturing for four seven-day periods. Increase the top fire to one and a half taels, then stop at two taels. When the days are complete, the cinnabar is subdued.

Use the vessel to nurture the body, then proceed to nurture powdered frost.

---

**Powder Method**

Beat two to four *sheng* of material—this is optimal. Take four taels of powdered frost, hard as crystal, and shape into small pieces. First wrap in white paper, then place in a dense silk bag. Boil in an infusion of lotus leaf ash for five *fu* periods.

Next, boil in the juice of *juxue* grass (a five-topped grass) and *jiandao* grass (water chestnut) for one *fu* period. Affix genuine silver foil to the body, or wrap the powder in silver foil, and place in a vessel with dead cinnabar. Forge a divine chamber from pure silver, first lining the bottom with cinnabar, then layering the powder, followed by another layer of cinnabar. Repeat the layering, then cover the top with dead cinnabar. Seal with mud and dry thoroughly. Place inside a vessel with dead arsenic, sealing as before.

Apply a top fire of two taels and nurture for seven seven-day periods. Test by burning: if no smoke appears, the process is complete. If not, nurture an additional *qian* to transmute one tael into top-grade treasure.

If the cinnabar vessel loses potency over time, remove the powdered frost and cinnabar together, grind with milk into a *qian* of powder, and transmute one tael. Then prepare a new vessel according to the above method—this is wondrous and divine. Do not treat it lightly.

---

**General Vessel Methods**

The divine chamber within the vessel should be forged thickly—do not make it thin.

Take one catty of white alum (not *mingfan*), pound, and steep in a thick infusion of wheat straw ash, one large cupful. Place in a porcelain vessel and drip-cook the alum until the liquid evaporates and the alum turns to water. Dry slowly over fire.

Then place the alum in a porcelain jar, seal tightly, and dry. Set in an ash basin, apply a top fire of two taels, and nurture for three *fu* periods. Remove and use as needed.

**Black Donkey Juice** (also called *mumi* or paper mulberry juice): Divide eight taels into four portions and grind into coarse powder. Wrap each two-tael portion first in two layers of white paper, then in coarse cloth, and suspend in grass juice. Boil in four small jars, covering the mouths with paper. Replenish the liquid as it dries. Frequently lift and agitate the cloth bags to facilitate dissolution. If a small residue remains, collect it and transfer to another jar to simmer. When three to five parts have dried, pour the liquid back and continue simmering until fully dry. Dry slowly over fire, break the jar, and combine the residue with the previously undissolved medicine. Grind finely.

Initially, eight taels of medicine will yield an increased weight when combined with frost. Seal and nurture in a vessel, opening once a month. After three to four months, the frost will have nurtured away the ash, leaving only the original medicine, snow-white and subdued.

For the aforementioned *xiaku* grass ash infusion: line the bottom of a wicker sieve with a layer of paper, pour the ash, and drip the liquid slowly. Collect in a clean porcelain vessel, let settle, and decant the clear liquid into another vessel. Repeat the settling process, retaining only the clear liquid and discarding the ash residue. This is the proper method for boiling medicine.

For all eight minerals, thorough boiling, refining, nurturing, and subduing are required before reversing the fire’s work. Only after prolonged processing do they die. Alum can be steeped and rinsed to sprout buds, which are then used to make rinsing vessels. The buds are rinsed again, sprouted anew, and this process is repeated until nine transformations are complete. Only then can the vessel be used to nurture cinnabar and mercury for medicinal consumption.

**Method for Calcining Cinnabar**
Take one *liang* of bright cinnabar and place it in a small crucible, approximately one *liang* in capacity. Add the cinnabar, then seal the mouth with *geng* (refined lead or tin), ensuring no gaps, and secure tightly. Place this within a clay crucible, then set a water-filled *ding* (tripod vessel) atop it, its copper base resting upon the *geng*. Fill the outer vessel with water and seal it tightly. Dry thoroughly. Calcine with twelve *jin* of fuel for about a day, then allow to cool. The mercury within the cinnabar will volatilize and condense upon the *geng*, appearing white and dry. Remove it, then repeat the calcination process as before. After several cycles, approximately four *liang* of dry mercury may be obtained, which can be cast into vessels to nurture the Three Yellows and other medicines, all of which will be subdued.

**Nine-Transformation Method for Boiling Arsenic Powder**
**Method for Boiling Powder**
Take *da huang* (rhubarb), *wu bei zi* (gallnut), *shan zhi* (gardenia), *chuan jiao* (Sichuan pepper), and *xi xin* (asarum), along with ginger juice, honey, and thick rice vinegar. Boil them together with water for a full day until the mixture turns black, which is the proper standard. Once dry, calcine again—this method is extraordinary. Know that this is the immortal’s art, left for alchemists as a foundational practice.

The above method uses *da huang*, *wu bei zi*, *shan zhi zi*, *chuan jiao*, and *xi xin*, ground into a coarse powder. Then, take two bowls each of fresh ginger juice, honey, and rice vinegar, mix with water, and suspend the powder in a cloth bag to boil for a day until the *fen shuang* (arsenic frost) turns black. Collect the powder separately, then calcine it with arsenic.

**Method for Boiling Arsenic**
*He zi* (chebulic myrobalan) and *yuan zhi* (polygala) are weighed,
*Di fu* (broom cypress), *niu xi* (achyranthes), and *ku shen* (sophora),
*Zhi mu* (anemarrhena), *qiang hua* (wolfsbane), and *da ji* (euphorbia)—
Steep them in river water, boiled to perfection.
Enclose in a silk pouch, the mysterious womb method,
Day and night, gently apply even heat.
Aiding the great medicine, none compare,
Transformation upon transformation, the Great Vehicle unfolds.

The above method uses equal parts of *he zi*, *yuan zhi*, *di fu zi*, *du niu xi*, *ku shen*, *zhi mu*, *qiang hua*, and *da ji*, ground coarsely and mixed with arsenic. Place them in a silk bag and boil in river water for a day and night. Remove, dry in an ash box, then grind into powder.

**Method for Calcining Arsenic Powder**
Bury a lamp dish level with the ground,
First wipe the interior with *hai zhi* (pig fat).
Lay *yin mu* (silver mother) as desired at the bottom,
Then arrange the boiled powder evenly upon it.
Place the boiled arsenic atop the powder,
Three parts powder to five parts arsenic by weight.
Mix *di fu* ash with *che qian zi* (plantain seed),
Layer them by weight atop the arsenic.
Seal all gaps beneath the dish,
Then apply mature fire, spreading it evenly.
Calcine with a three-*jin* fire’s force,
Remove one *jin* of fuel, cover the medicine with ash.

The above method uses a lamp dish buried in the earth. First, lightly burn *hai zhi* within it, then add *yin mu sha* (silver mother sand) or *yin mu* powder as desired. Next, place the *fen shuang* (arsenic frost), then the boiled arsenic atop it, covering the *fen shuang*. Above this, use three ingredients: *di fu*, *che qian zi* ash, and herbal powder, piled atop the arsenic. Apply three *jin* of mature fire, reducing it by two *jin*, then withdraw the fire and cover with cold ash. Once cool, separate the arsenic and powder, storing each apart. Repeat this process three times before use.

When arsenic and powder are calcined to spiritual efficacy,
The fields’ crops are already sown.
They say it guards the poor scholar,
And indeed, this is clearly so.
It can transmute red silver into treasure,
Fit to craft vessels of refinement.
The powder can transform red substances,
The arsenic can nurture the silver’s body.

The above method explains: If following the transmutation process in sequence, at this stage, great accomplishment is possible. First, take *lu* (green pigment) to refine red silver, transforming it into an infant, which is then bathed in the Jade Pool three times. After feeding it the Heavenly Mother’s milk three times, the red color is shed. The Heavenly Mother’s milk is the arsenic atop the vessel. For one *liang* of red substance, use one *qian* and a half of Heavenly Mother’s milk, applying it three times. Once the infant has shed its garments, use the White Snow Divine Elixir to guide it into the immortal realm, where it becomes celestial bone. The White Snow Divine Elixir is *fen shuang*. Apply it in three stages: first, let the infant return to the mother, consume the Heavenly Milk, and transform with the mother. Then, bathe it again in the Jade Pool to purify it. Apply the Divine Elixir three times, then briefly use *chu shan qian* (lead from the mountain’s depths) and *lao shuang* (aged frost) to refine its form, naturally forging a great vessel.

If using *da qi shuang* (great seven-frost grains), the highest grade is pure; half-pure is middling; *xiao san qi* (small three-seven) is the lowest. This is but a rough outline of the greater work—use your discretion. The powder serves as a vessel, the *chang nü* (ever-maiden) as the infant, and the household’s greater work is the *san qi mu sha* (three-seven mother cinnabar). If using arsenic as the vessel, nurture the White Snow as the Divine Elixir. Once the elixir is complete, transformations are endless. The arsenic vessel also becomes a great medicine, and the spiritual cinnabar and mother cinnabar together form the great vessel.

First transformation: Arsenic vessel nurtures *zhu ling* (vermilion spirit).
Second transformation: Within *zhu ling*, cinnabar forms spontaneously.
Third transformation: Within cinnabar, nurture *jiao gong sha* (mercury sand), which is the sand that responds to heaven and earth’s darkness.
Fourth transformation: Within mercury sand, nurture *yu xiao qiong zhi* (jade laughter, jasper branches).
Fifth transformation: Within *yu xiao*, cinnabar is refined anew.
Sixth transformation: Take half a *jin* or one *jin* and sixteen *liang* of cinnabar, aligning with the celestial pattern. Place the divine treasure within the cinnabar, nurturing four *liang* of it as the great work’s endless cycle.
For the great elixir, mix with *chu* juice (paper mulberry), form into pills the size of *tong* seeds (tung tree seeds). One pill extends life; one pill dries mercury.
Seventh transformation: Within the divine chamber, nurture one *liang* of *ci xiong* (male and female) as the great medicine, which transforms into the Gold Mother. Its form shifts from white to red, then returns to luminous red. This red *geng* (lead) is the return to the original source.

Eighth transformation: Within cinnabar, nurture the male and female to cultivate *geng*. Take eight *liang* of cinnabar to nurture two *liang* of male and female; after forty-nine days, four *liang* are achieved. Combine the embryo with *geng* and nurture it within the divine chamber. When the days are complete, the medicine is obtained—one *qian* can transmute cinnabar-silver into red *geng*.

Ninth transformation: Use the male and female as the crucible; the cinnabar-male is called the Great Elixir Medicine. Take one *liang* each of cinnabar, male, and female, place them within the former male-female crucible, and nurture them in the *geng* divine chamber. After forty-nine days, use one *jin* of the former medicine as the crucible—this is the great wonder, completing the celestial pattern. Form into pills with *chu* juice, the size of *wutong* seeds. One pill can dry ten *liang* of mercury, producing superior *geng*.

The firing regimen is as follows, now appended again:
For the first through fourth transformations, apply fire once daily, two *liang* each morning and evening. On the third day, add one *liang*, making three *liang*. From the third to the sixth day, increase by one *liang* again, making four *liang*. The fire’s intensity should be moderated to maturity; if the heat is excessive, adjust gradually—this is optimal. The ash may be raised without hindrance.
For the fifth through seventh transformations, follow the usual method. After seven days, replace with four *liang* of mature fire daily, ensuring no deficiency, though it need not reach five *liang*.
For the Great Medicine’s forty-nine-day cycle, proceed gradually, without applying five *liang* of fire; thereafter, the same applies.

*The Precious Formula for the Golden Elixir and Great Medicine of Master Wen Zhen*
Dong Qi’s Culaishan Retired Elder, Cui Fang Huishu, styled Master Wen Zhen, compiled this formula for the Great Elixir Medicine, with a postscript following the *Bencao*. Here, extraneous methods are omitted, and only the most extraordinary are recorded, to be elaborated in a separate compilation, preserving their renown.
Written by Mengxuan Resident of the Wuji Hall in the Quande Abbey of Nanyue, during the Zhongyuan Festival of the Jiazi year of the Shaoxing reign.

In the Qingli reign’s guiwei year, Fang was appointed to Hunan, where he pacified the Yao and Liao tribes of Jingxi Cave and governed the northeastern precincts of Wugang County, three hundred *li* distant from Changsha. At that time, the former chief minister Liu Chongzhi governed Tanzhou and summoned Fang to oversee construction, whereupon Fang moved his family to reside at the Green Robe Temple. One day, a local man named Li Bi visited—aged around seventy, his complexion ruddy and youthful—who discoursed extensively on elixir arts. He then bestowed upon Fang the method for the Cinnabar Elixir of the Perfected Lord Wei. Upon examining its procedures, Fang found no discrepancies, though its hidden subtleties remained obscure. Bi urged him again: "You should undertake this." The method employed two parts sulphur to eight parts mercury, placed in the water-and-fire crucible and refined through nine cycles, whereupon it would naturally coalesce. Though Fang had official duties, he often found leisure. Following the method, he performed the nine cycles, yet the result was mere quicksilver. He questioned Bi, who had no answer. Fang pondered deeply: the method was profoundly ingenious, but without grasping the immortals’ secret instructions, success was impossible.

Later, while stationed on garrison duty, he journeyed to Mount Heng and paid homage to Master Yangsu Lan, seeking enlightenment. Master Lan said: "This method is exceedingly refined and most easily executed. Yet you have not mastered the immortal classics, hence the disparity between sulphur and mercury. In the first cycle, add two *liang* of sulphur; by the sixth cycle, gradually reduce it, and in the seventh cycle, add no sulphur at all. For sulphur is the utmost yang, and mercury the utmost yin. Each time they are stir-fried and sealed in the crucible, fire is applied until halted. Only by the seventh cycle does the mercury cease to volatilize, thus achieving subjugation. After nine cycles, transfer it to an external furnace for nurturing, following distinct fire regimens, then calcine to remove the sulphur, leaving the mercury as a solitary essence to form the elixir treasure."

Fang then understood Li Bi’s words and bowed in gratitude. From Master Lan’s instructions, every preparation he undertook thereafter met with precision. This elixir, in its highest use, grants eternal life; in its middle use, aids others; and in its lowest, enriches one’s household. The key lies in holding a generous heart and eschewing greed—thus is the Dao accomplished.

Disciple Cui Fang of Daliang respectfully records this.
Eulogy to the Perfected Lord Wei, annotated by Lan Zizhen.

Refine the cinnabar according to ancient methods: two parts sulphur to eight parts mercury, stir-fried to form "green gold." Then grind it finely before placing it in the water-and-fire crucible for calcination. Initially, the ratio of two to eight governs the union of Heaven and Earth—its meaning is noted above. On the second day, do not alter the Celestial Origin; stir-fry and refine eight times, following the same method as before. Only then is it called the "divine achievement with full cycles." From the first to the seventh, it becomes "spirit sand." For the third cycle, halve the sulphur: use one tael. In the fourth, the solitary yang must not be scattered—when stir-frying with the same amount of sulphur, ensure no loss, and gather it meticulously. For the fifth, do not add to the three parts: use seven mace and five candareens of sulphur, applied beneath the furnace. In the sixth, not even half a grain should be recklessly released: use half a tael of sulphur. By the seventh, it is confined within the "fire dwelling"; after seven transformations, it turns red and becomes green—this is the "wood within fire." It is also said: "The dragon emerges from within the fire." After being captured and subdued by sulphur seven times, it can no longer ascend, and thus is tamed by fire to form the treasure. In the eighth, the celestial soul must not be allowed to dissipate—the green gold solidifies, leaving no free mercury. The ninth is called the "returning elixir" or "reverted yang": after nine cycles, the yin reverts to yang nature. The dead who consume it will revive.

After the green gold forms the elixir, place a single grain upon a crane’s crown. Have dozens of skilled archers shoot at it from fifty paces away, yet none will strike it all day. This elixir greatly extends human life and restores departed souls. Each of the nine stir-frying cycles demands meticulous care. The fire regimen uses five catties throughout, from the first to the ninth cycle. For the fifth cycle, discard the key and fan the fire, using a total of forty-five catties of charcoal. Nurture the spirit sand to resist fire: with each refining to the third cycle, its color becomes exquisite. Then incorporate this sand into the nine-cycle green gold and nurture it further, so that it resists fire and becomes a treasure. Only with the "golden lord" can fruition be achieved.

Once fire resistance is complete, take lead and refine it in the "flower pool." Use one tael of "river chariot" to two taels of lead—a lead-to-sand ratio of two to one. Refine it until it gleams like snow, then it is ready. After the elixir is completed, use what you have gained to offer thanks to Heaven and Earth, aiding the orphaned, impoverished, and afflicted. Practice kindness without greed. Thus shall you escape the dust of the mortal world and avoid sinking into oblivion. By bestowing blessings upon all beings and establishing merit and virtue, Heaven will protect you, granting long life and ascension to the Golden Gates, where you shall wander and feast in the Jade Capital.

*Method for the Cold Grove Jade Tree and Gushing Spring Vault*
First, prepare the spirit sand...

Two taels of superior sulfur and eight taels of mercury are ground together until thoroughly blended. Place them in a ceramic water-and-fire crucible, seal the crucible’s mouth with purified clay, and secure it with iron wire. Position water and charcoal above the crucible, then apply a ring of fire around it to refine the spirit sand. When the water atop the crucible has evaporated to five shallow cups and no sound emerges from within, the process is complete. Withdraw the fire, remove the spirit sand, and split it into dice-shaped lumps.

Grind equal parts Sichuan peppercorn, white atractylodes, Sichuan aconite, and arisaema into fine powder—enough to coat the aforementioned spirit sand lumps. Place the sand in a raw silk pouch, tie it securely, and suspend it in a large sand bowl filled with aged rice vinegar using bamboo skewers, ensuring the pouch does not touch the bottom. Boil the vinegar until dry, then remove the pouch. Gently pat the spirit sand dry with soft cloth, and when slightly damp, coat it with iron filings for bodily application. Store it securely.

Prepare an airtight Xinzhou sandalwood box. Take the finest silver filings or beads, spread a layer of silver beads at the bottom, then arrange the spirit sand lumps like lotus seedpods atop them. Cover with another layer of silver beads. If any spirit sand remains, add another layer of silver beads above the empty space, then cover the sand lumps again. Once the top and bottom are fully layered, place a round piece of Kunlun paper (dyed with high-quality ink) over the contents and sprinkle a small amount of table salt on it.

Seal the box’s opening with water-mixed white kaolin, secure it with iron wire, and fashion a loop at the top for lifting. Coat the exterior of the box with a uniform layer of clay, roughly one fen thick, pressing firmly to prevent cracks. Allow it to dry in the shade.

Prepare a large sugar jar large enough to hold the sandalwood box. Fill it nine-tenths full with temple paper-money ash that has been fired until glowing red. First, add half the ash, then place the box inside, and cover it completely with the remaining ash.

Cut high-quality white charcoal into three-inch segments, weigh them, and ignite until glowing red. Place them in the jar, keeping them three to four cun from the box’s top. Nurture the fire for five days:
- On the first day, use four taels of charcoal.
- On the second day, use five taels.

On the third day, use six taels of charcoal.
On the fourth day, use seven taels.
On the fifth day, use eight taels.
After five days are complete, remove the numinous cinnabar and continue nurturing it.

The firing regimen requires adding charcoal only at dawn each day, continuing until the following dawn. This aligns with the sun’s celestial movement, embodying the natural subtlety of withdrawal and replenishment. Those who do not understand this—adding charcoal at dawn and dusk—disrupt the workings of creation, severing the root of Heaven and Earth’s generative power and losing the origin of yin-yang transformation, thus leading to failure.

The method: for every four taels of silver pearl, nurture one tael of numinous cinnabar. When accumulated in sufficient quantity, remove the mother (residue), using only the already-nurtured numinous cinnabar ground into powder. Again, use four taels to nurture one tael. For unnurtured cinnabar, wait until five days have passed and a surplus is obtained, then take four taels of this numinous cinnabar powder, pour it over one tael of mercury, seal it at the center, and apply the firing regimen as before to secure it. After the nurturing period is complete, sprouts will naturally emerge, which are to be plucked as they grow.

This charcoal must be the fine white charcoal from Luzicibiao in Jiande County, Yanzhou—only that which, when struck like a deer’s leg, does not break is superior. Charcoal from other places is unsuitable.

[...] lotus-form.

The "Two-Eight Numinous Cinnabar" Method

Take two taels of finely ground sulfur paste and eight taels of mercury—only the white variety is to be used; black mercury is unsuitable. Place these two ingredients together in a mortar, gradually add half a cup of rice vinegar, and grind them evenly into a fine mixture. Pour this into an iron pan, first coating the pan with sesame oil. Stir continuously over a slow fire until it forms cinnabar grains. Return it to the mortar and grind finely again. Then pour it back into the iron pan, stir continuously over a slow fire until it forms grains once more, and this is called "Green-Gold Head." Grind it finely again, place it in a crucible, and cover it with a *jian* bowl filled with water. Take two taels of red halloysite, two taels of calcined glauberite, and half a tael of calcined lead oxide, grind them evenly, and mix with rice vinegar to form a paste. Seal the crucible’s seams with this paste, bind it securely with thick iron wire, and attach two iron wire loops for threading the iron firing rod. Place it over a slow fire to dry, adding a bit more powder as needed. Then gradually apply a layer of *guan* clay, drying each layer before adding the next. When sealing, the fire must not be too fierce, lest the medicine escape. Once the seal is over an inch thick, it can withstand the firing. Then place it in the furnace, with the iron firing rod standing outside the furnace and a horizontal iron rod on either side to suspend the water-fire cauldron. Fill the water cauldron with water, replenishing as it evaporates. Begin with a small amount of charcoal, gradually increasing to eight catties, but only fill to the midpoint of the water-fire cauldron. Pack the charcoal tightly to prevent the escape of fire qi. If the ashes accumulate, remove the charcoal and repack it tightly. If flames appear, cover the wind holes with cloth. When the charcoal is spent—or when five cups of water remain—remove the water-fire cauldron and place it in another furnace to cool. First remove all the *guan* clay, then the iron wires, then the water cauldron. Use the back of a knife to break the lower segment of the fire cauldron, then lightly tap the upper segment to retrieve the medicine. Pick out the ashes and grind the medicine until no sound is heard.

If further refinement is desired, add one tael of raw sulfur to ten taels of numinous cinnabar, along with the Green-Gold Head, which is optimal. Then grind them together finely and seal as before. For the *guan* clay, use fine yellow clay mixed with paper fiber and four taels of salt, kneaded with water the day before. Prepare the water-fire cauldron with sufficient water, and use the paper-fiber salt clay to form a rim and base, piercing six or seven small holes before drying. Without these holes, the cauldron may float and not sit firmly. After adding the medicine, seal the small holes with the sealing paste, level the base, and seal the seams. Use three taels of red halloysite ground into fine powder and mixed with rice vinegar for sealing. Use charcoal without bark, cut into three-inch pieces, totaling about sixteen catties. Prepare three iron wires, three iron firing rods, half a cup of rice vinegar, a small amount of sesame oil, and five cups of water before placing it in the furnace.

**Sealing and Calcining Method**
First grind the sulfur extremely fine before adding the mercury, grinding together from *mao* (5–7 a.m.) to *you* (5–7 p.m.), or from *chen* (7–9 a.m.) to *xu* (7–9 p.m.), until they are thoroughly combined and no mercury globules remain. Do not pause even briefly, for if you stop, it may take two or three days to recombine. When placing the mixture in the crucible, warm it slightly first, and heat the crucible as well. Use a two-to-eight salt-clay mixture to seal the crucible’s opening: eight parts salt to two parts clay, mixed with good vinegar and pounded thousands of times. Seal the furnace tightly in seven layers, and once the seal is dry, begin the firing. Start with four bowls of base fire, ensuring no ghostly flames arise. Gradually add fire until it reaches the midpoint of the crucible. Another sealing method involves adding a small amount of needle-like iron filings to red halloysite, mixed with *guan* clay and vinegar, which is excellent. Another calcining method involves placing the water-fire cauldron in the furnace as usual and calcining for one *fu* period (twelve hours). For the second refinement, add sulfur; by the third refinement, omit the water cauldron and place a ceramic vessel beneath it to cover the water cauldron, applying top fire for calcining. This method is uniquely effective, embodying the principles of *jiji* (completion) and *weiji* (incompletion). This formula was transmitted by Chen Benren of Tiantai; it is most wondrous and must be kept secret, not recklessly disclosed.

**Hua-Chi (Flower Pool) Method**
Mix lime with oyster-shell lime, knead with hot water to form a dish, and place the "Golden Duke" (mercury) with the extracted numinous cinnabar. Heat them together until white, and the treasure is complete.

**Mercury-Washing Method**
Rub the mercury with rice until the rice turns white. Then rub it with rush pith until the pith no longer blackens.

**Refined Mercury Method**
Take transparent cinnabar, regardless of size, grind it into powder, and mix it evenly with charcoal powder and glutinous rice water. Place it in a crucible, and use an iron rod to shape it into a honeycomb-like structure, allowing it to dry. Prepare another pot, bury it in the ground, and fill it with water to eight-tenths capacity. Place the crucible with the dried cinnabar on top of the buried water pot, seal the seams tightly with paper-fiber clay, and dry it over a fire. Use five catties of charcoal, igniting the fire from the top. When the crucible turns red-hot, remove the charcoal. Once cool, retrieve the refined mercury from the buried water pot. From one tael of ordinary cinnabar, only eight *fen* of mercury is obtained.

**Fire-Taming Cinnabar**
Take four taels of cinnabar and boil it in a cup of rice vinegar until dry. Coat the cinnabar with ink and vinegar, place it in a bag made of fine silk, and tie it tightly. Grind egg white with ink and coat the silk bag, allowing it to dry. Grind the kernel of a green silkworm cocoon into powder, mix it with honey, and knead the cinnabar into a firm ball. Place it in a sand container, lining the bottom with chopped *guanzhu* leaves (green silkworm cocoon leaves).

Then place the cinnabar inside, cover it with another layer of *guanzhu* leaves, and seal the seams of the container with liver-mixed clay. Bind the container crosswise with iron wire and let it dry. Extract juice from daylily roots and mix it with clay to thoroughly seal all joints.

Arrange ashes around the base of the container, leaving only the top exposed, and encircle it with a single layer of charcoal. Ignite a fire from the top until the container is thoroughly heated.

**Method for Polishing Cinnabar to a Gold-like Luster**
Apply a paste of iron oxide powder mixed with water, let it sit overnight, then polish it repeatedly with several layers of silk until the cinnabar gleams like gold.

**Method for Polishing Cinnabar to a Silver-like Luster**
Grind mercury, *Centella asiatica* (Indian pennywort), and fresh brick dust together into a fine powder. Dry the mercury, then use this mixture to polish the cinnabar until it resembles silver. Alternatively, mix thin alum and white alum powder for polishing.

**Method for Nurturing the Great Cinnabar Elixir with Fire**

Crush four taels of elixir base. Extract one tael of true mercury from cinnabar, and add a small amount of gold and silver filings. First, seal a water-fire crucible with Six-One Clay and dry it over a fire. Next, bathe the elixir base in well-drawn water and place it inside the crucible. Then, mix one tael of true mercury with the gold and silver filings, and pour it over the elixir base in the crucible. Place the water crucible atop the furnace, first sealing the seams with paper strips. Then, apply Six-One Clay to the entire assembly, dry it thoroughly, and ensure it is tightly sealed without gaps.

Select a room and prepare the furnace according to the prescribed method, using clean paper ash. First, warm the furnace with fire, then place an iron tripod inside. Position the elixir crucible atop the tripod, ensuring it is level and stable. Separately, weigh four taels of flaming charcoal and arrange it around the crucible, adjusting the fire’s proximity and height to match the elixir. After the fire has warmed the crucible, cover it with ashes. Fill the water crucible with warm water, checking it frequently to prevent it from drying out.

Daily at the *mao* (5–7 a.m.) and *you* (5–7 p.m.) hours, add fire and replenish water as before, ensuring the timing is never missed. After nurturing the fire for half a month, open the crucible to add more mercury, reseal it, and continue the process. After the fourth cycle of nurturing and adding mercury, the total weight of the elixir base and mercury will be eight taels. Add two more taels of mercury—this is the ancient method known as "four additions, one supplement." Some practitioners open the crucible every seven days, but this risks incomplete mercury absorption, weakening the mother elixir and hindering success. For elixirs nurtured to over ten taels, the crucible may be opened once a month or after forty-nine days, though this is not strictly required.

Once the elixir base reaches over one catty, do not add more mercury. Continue nurturing the fire for three months until the elixir base solidifies and turns golden. Then open the crucible, grind the elixir, and select the hardest, mercury-free portions for later consumption. The remainder is treated as before: mercury is poured over it, and the fire is nurtured—this is called the "elixir mother." Mother and child elixirs mutually generate and sustain each other, making their use inexhaustible.

**Method for Extracting Mercury**
Use eight taels of cinnabar (or five to seven taels, as the quantity is not strictly fixed), five taels of charcoal powder, and one tael of honey. First, seal a crucible or earthen pot with clay and dry it over a fire. Then, mix the cinnabar and charcoal powder with honey water, knead it into a paste, and pack it tightly into the crucible. Seal the crucible’s mouth with a clay disc and dry it. Pierce five to seven holes in the disc. Next, dig a pit and place a large basin filled with water inside. Invert the cinnabar crucible onto the water basin, ensuring a snug fit, and seal the seams with Six-One Clay to ensure airtightness. Coat the ground around the setup with coarse clay to prevent water and fire from interacting violently.

Ignite twenty catties of charcoal from the top and burn it thoroughly. Add ten to twenty more catties of charcoal from morning to evening, carefully regulating the fire to avoid excess or insufficiency. The next day, once the crucible has cooled, open it to retrieve the cinnabar, which will have transformed into true mercury in the water basin. Scoop it out and dry it over a fire. If the cinnabar is of good quality, each tael yields seven to eight *qian* of mercury; if poor, only half is obtained. The remaining cinnabar residue can be found in the charcoal basin, though it is no longer useful. The extracted mercury is the essence of the cinnabar.

In all fire-based methods, the key lies in carefully regulating the fire—neither too much nor too little—to avoid success or failure. This is transmitted orally and mastered through practice.

**Method for Nurturing the Yellow Sprout**
Before nurturing the elixir base, prepare the upper water and lower fire crucibles by mixing equal parts yellow earth and fine sand with paper fiber to form a clay. Seal the crucibles with this mixture and dry them in the sun. Place the elixir base inside the fire crucible. Before sealing the top, pour four *qian* of prepared mercury over each tael of elixir base, then cover it with the water crucible. Seal the seams with the previously prepared paper-fiber clay. Apply clay from the water crucible downward to form a gourd-like shape, no thicker than three *fen*.

Dry the setup over a fire. If the elixir base is hard and gray, grind it into small pieces first.

**Method for Nurturing Fire**
Use a large-mouthed, small earthen jar filled with paper ash (which should clump within five to seven days—unlike straw or cogon grass ash). Place an iron tripod inside the jar (not too tall) and position the elixir crucible atop it, ensuring stability. Fill the upper crucible with water, but not to the brim. Weigh long, red-hot charcoal pieces (about four to five *cun* each) and arrange them in four sections. Begin the fire at the *mao* hour (5–7 a.m.), replacing the old charcoal at the *you* hour (5–7 p.m.). At *mao*, place the charcoal north-south; at *you*, place it east-west.

Before adding charcoal, cover the water crucible with a tile, then stir the ash with a fire poker to evenly distribute the heat before placing the charcoal. Remove the tile afterward.

When adding water, always use a kettle to heat it to the same temperature as the water in the crucible before pouring. The water crucible must never run dry.

Every seven days, open the crucible to replenish mercury. If the elixir is abundant later on, the interval need not be fixed—once every half-month or month will suffice.

If the elixir head readily absorbs mercury and free mercury is scarce, the medicine is potent. When the mercury is fully incorporated, open the crucible to retrieve it; further refinement follows.

If absorption is slow and free mercury remains abundant, with little "jade forest and jasper trees," another method applies.

**Later Stage Formula for the Yellow Sprout Great Elixir**
The Yellow Sprout elixir head is refined with utmost precision by immortals and sages. The marvel of water and fire in harmony, the clear interplay of yin and yang—adding mercury and nurturing the fire follows the way a mother nurtures her child.

If too much mercury is added, the quantity may seem sufficient, but the mother grows weak and the child timid, unable to withstand the fire. Ingesting it yields no benefit, for the mercury will flee at the slightest heat.

Better to use slightly less than the prescribed weight, adhering to the proper timing and fire management. Nurture it over time without adding more mercury, maintaining the fire for years.

When ready for use, select the hardest portions from within, grind them to the size of mung beans, and place them in a crucible. Set a water vessel above it, and each day surround it with mature fire until the crucible and elixir head glow red inside and out. Sweep away the mercury condensation from the water vessel’s base once daily. Only when the mercury settles after intense heating is it ready.

To retrieve the elixir, place it in a bag of boiled silk and suspend it inside a sand jar. Add four to five *liang* of finely chopped licorice and simmer over a slow fire for a day. Then boil it again for another day with ten to twenty *yu gan zi* (Phyllanthus emblica). Remove it, wrap small portions (three to five *fen* each) in boiled silk, and place each packet inside a large radish, hollowed out with its top cut open. Secure the top with a skewer, wrap it in cloth, and steam it over rice until the radish turns black. Grind the elixir finely, return it to a red-hot crucible once more, then form it into millet-sized pills with white congee. Taken thus, it will cause no vomiting or diarrhea.

**Method for Roasting Gold**
Take one *liang* each of male and female [gold], one *liang* of sulfur, and one *liang* of *pao sha* (calcined borax). Use a large crucible, coat its interior with egg white, then sprinkle powdered *ma huang* (ephedra) nodes inside. Add the four ingredients, surround the crucible with charcoal fire, and gradually sprinkle four *liang* of powdered *chan du yu jin* (toad-belly turmeric) over it. When exhausted, remove and grind the mixture into a fine powder. Return it to the crucible, cover with another four *liang* of *chan du yu jin* powder, and refine it over a strong fire. Once done, grind it into an extremely fine powder for use.

To apply: Hammer fine silver into thin sheets, coat them with saliva, then sprinkle the powdered medicine onto the surface. Roast the reverse side over an intense fire, and the color will penetrate in a single heating.

**Method for Refining Metal (Guan Geng)**
Take two *liang* each of Jiangxi green alum, alum, and green salt; one *liang* of *bo ke* (potassium nitrate); and two *liang* of mercury, suspended and boiled. Use a new, unused iron pot with two to three bowls of river water, and boil the mercury with the above ingredients until dry. Strain out the oil, wrap the mercury in paper, and bury it underground for a *fu* period (twelve days). Upon retrieval, it will be hard.

Another refining method: Take one *liang* of *bei lu gan shi* (a type of calamine, known in the West as *tutiya*). Use an unmeasured amount of jujube pulp, wheat, and cypress leaves. Pound them with strong vinegar into a paste, coat the dried mercury, and refine it in a *shao* furnace for two hours. Pour the contents into a vat of water to produce high-quality refined metal. If the *dao lu gan shi* is purple, the result will be purple.

For use as a body adhesive, mix with a small amount of arsenic yellow—highly effective.

**Method for Polishing Copper to Resemble Silver**
Boil objects in a solution of *po xiao* (sodium sulfate), then refine with salt and gypsum. Use *xiang si zi* (Abrus precatorius) and *ma ya xiao* (sodium nitrate). Grind finely and polish—this yields a silver-like finish with half a year’s effort.

**Deadening Borax (Si Peng Liu)**
Boil *peng tie jiao* (borax iron residue) in the natural juice of *feng wei cao* (Pteris multifida) for half an hour. For *liu* (sulfur), boil it in the juice of *shui tian cao* (water-field grass) for half an hour—both will be deadened.

**Liu Langxian’s Qi-Infused Great Elixir**
For every *liang* of mother [mercury], infuse five *qian* of cinnabar. The more mother used, the better.

Fashion a three-legged stand from thick iron wire and place a bowl securely atop charcoal, heating it from above and below. The bowl should be an iron or *jian* bowl. Add seven parts sesame oil, thirty castor beans, and a handful of Sichuan peppercorns, along with the mother and cinnabar, into the oil. Heat until the castor beans turn brown. Remove, wrap the mixture in silk, and squeeze out the oil and medicine along with the mother, leaving only the cinnabar to be formed into pills.

Next, use *dong qing* (wintergreen) leaves as a lining for the pills. Remove the veins from the leaves and wrap the cinnabar completely, calling these "Lao Jun balls." Mix rice vinegar with flour to make a paste, then coat the balls with a layer of clay. Further wrap them with *xin lian* (arsenic) mixed with water, applying two to three layers to ensure no gaps. Clean any cracks thoroughly, then place the balls in a charcoal furnace and heat with a bellows until red-hot. Once the fire subsides, remove the cinnabar—it will now resist the teeth.

Finally, melt five *liang* of salt in a crucible to form a liquid, then pass the cinnabar through this "gate."

First, dig an earthen pit matching the size of the crucible. Once the salt has melted to a third of its volume, pour it into the pit, then swiftly add the cinnabar and immediately seal it with a brick, pressing down firmly with the foot to let it settle. Retrieve the cinnabar and place it back into the crucible for another firing.

Next, prepare half a bowl of water with a paper trough inside. Pour the cinnabar into the trough, and it will become treasure. Skim off a small amount of *pengsha* (borax) to clarify it, then pour it out.

Before adding the cinnabar to the salt, ensure the pit is dug to match the crucible’s size, perfectly level, and without gaps. Use a brick to cover the cinnabar immediately after placing it inside. This is the swiftest method, though it differs slightly from the *Gan Geng* method.

The *Gan Geng* method, as before, involves adding the mother to the cinnabar, placing it in a fine *Jian* bowl, and mixing it with castor and peppercorns, along with a few slices of *qiannianren* (asparagus root), all steeped in oil. Instead of *Lao Jun balls*, use saliva to mix *lu ganshi* (calamine) powder and *qianbaishuang* (lead frost) as a coating, then fire it to form treasure.

Use high-quality alum, *wufangcao* (purslane), and *jincheng daocao* (golden city rice straw), burn them to ash, and leach the liquid. Boil it in a sugar jar over a husk fire until dry to make a *kui* (nourishing vessel). Fifty *liang* can nourish one *liang*.

From the *Tai Shang Zi Sheng Xuan Jing*, the *Four Spirit Kui* bestowed by Lord Wang Jun:
- Cinnabar
- Sulfur
- Realgar
- Orpiment

Weigh each equally. Crush them to the size of coarse rice grains, wrap tightly in multiple layers of white silk, and boil with *huanghua* (yellow flower) and *jichangcao* (chickweed) juice in a double boiler over a slow fire for seven *fu* (seven-day periods). Dry in the sun and reuse.

- *Pengsha* (borax): 5 *qian*
- *Danfan* (chalcanthite): 5 *qian*
- *Naosha* (sal ammoniac): 1 *liang*

Use warm water in a double boiler over a slow fire for fourteen days, then remove and dry in the sun.

Use five *liang* of red gold, hammered into a box. Place the *Four Spirit* medicine inside and seal it tightly. Use eight *liang* of silver, beaten into beads. First, place half the silver in a clay box, then set the gold box on top, covering it with the remaining silver beads. Seal the clay box tightly, bind the gold box inside and the silver box outside with iron wire, then coat with salt clay. Once dry, place it in an ash jar and nourish with fire.

Fire regimen: forty-nine days.
- Days 1–7: Use mature fire. 1.5 *liang* in two daily sessions—morning and evening—without fail, or the result will be poor. If the fire weakens, add half a *liang* of mature fire.
- Days 8–14: Use mature fire. 2 *liang* in two daily sessions. If the fire weakens, add half a *liang* of mature fire.
- Days 15–21: Use mature fire. 2.5 *liang* in two daily sessions. If the fire weakens, add half a *liang* of mature fire.
- Days 22–28: Use mature fire. 2.75 *liang* in two daily sessions. If the fire weakens, add half a *liang* of mature fire.
- Days 29–49: Use mature fire. 3 *liang* in two daily sessions without fail. If the fire weakens, add 1 *liang* of mature fire.

Once the fire regimen is complete, examine the medicine. If it is black, heat it further. If it turns yellow, stop. If not, continue nourishing for another fourteen days, and it will be complete. Divide each *liang* into ten packets.

**Refining Method:**
Use one *liang* of the finest silver. Melt it, then add 3 *qian* of medicine in three batches. Once the silver’s surface is clear and free of impurities, pour it out—it will become treasure.

Guard this secret, guard it well. Do not transmit it recklessly. Only those who aid the poor and accumulate merit may receive it.

**The Great Immortal Medicine: Four Spirit Kui Formula**
Use one *jin* of raw sulfur from overseas, transparent like cinnabar stone. Chip it into lychee pit-sized pieces. Use two *dou* each of *yimu* (motherwort) and *yashecao* (duck-tongue grass) juice. Place the sulfur in a kudzu cloth bag and suspend it in the juice to boil for one *fu*, maintaining the fire day and night for seven full days. Remove and test a small amount over fire. If not yet subdued, boil again until it is.

Divide into two portions and place in a large crucible. Use thirty *jin* of hard charcoal to fire it, with two people fanning vigorously until it melts into liquid. Pour into two *Jian* bowls. If the sulfur retains its original color, it has become the supreme medicine. Grind it into an extremely fine powder. Separately, use four *liang* of raw sulfur, chipped into small pieces as before, and boil in the two-herb juice for one *fu*. Remove it.

Use the previous one *jin* of sulfur to make a *kui*. Then take the later four *liang* and, following the *lotus* method, place it in a cinnabar box. Line with two or three layers of *Kunlun* paper, grind the sulfur into a fine powder, and spread a layer on the paper. Add a layer of fixed medicine, then fill the box with *baihu* (white tiger) powder. Seal tightly, place in an ash pool, and nourish with four *liang* of fire for seven days. Remove it—the sulfur will be properly subdued.

Next, use four *liang* of leaf orpiment, chipped to the same size as before. Boil it in *yangtigen* (sheep’s hoof root) juice for one *fu*, then remove and grind finely. Mix it with the second batch of four *liang* of sulfur, grind both into an extremely fine powder, and form into longan-sized honey pills. Place them in the sulfur *kui* and nourish for seven days with four *liang* of fire. By this point, no pressing is needed—the orpiment will be subdued.

Then use four *liang* of *jiguanxiong* (cock’s comb realgar). Boil it in *shanwoju* (mountain lettuce) juice for one *fu*, remove, and grind finely with the previous orpiment and sulfur. Form into longan-sized honey pills, place in the *kui* as before, and nourish for seven days—it too will be subdued.

The *Dan Jing* states: "If one yellow dies, all yellows grieve. If one yellow does not die, all yellows fly."

First refine the sulfur to render it inert, then subdue the *cinnabar* (female) and *realgar* (male). Once the Three Yellows are dead, further subdue *cinnabar* (vermilion), thereby completing the great elixir’s transformations.

Select four *liang* of *cinnabar* with mirror-like grains. Boil it in *diding* (Chinese violet) and *jichangcao* (chicken-gut grass) juice for one *fu*, then remove. Mix with *baifuzi* (giant typhonium) and *pengsha* (borax) powder, knead with refined honey into adherent pastilles. Place in the *kui* as before and nourish for seven days—upon retrieval, the cinnabar will have become a treasure.

Set aside the initial sulfur *kui* (weighing one *jin*) for other uses. Take the four previously nourished agents, combine them to make one *jin*, grind into fine powder, and prepare a *Four Spirits Kui*. First, use three parts of pure *geng* (lead) and seven parts of mercury to form cinnabar grains. Boil them in *ziheche* (purple river vehicle) and millet-water decoction (three *sheng*) for one day. Wrap the cinnabar grains in boiled silk, shaping them into small longan-sized pellets. First dry-roast them in lime until hard, then boil as in the *lotus method*. Arrange them in the *Four Spirits Kui*, cover, and nourish with four *liang* of fire for seven days. Upon retrieval, test over fire—if not yet subdued, nourish for two more days. Repeat this process three to five times until the *kui*’s power gradually awakens, yielding *erba gengsha* (two-eight lead-cinnabar). Continue nourishing three to five more times; if the substance becomes firm, heavy, and deep in color, resistant to melting or breaking, it forms *jiuyi qingsha* (nine-one light cinnabar). When the light cinnabar, through further nourishment, develops a deep, fine hue indistinguishable from true gold, the *kui* becomes fully efficacious and may be used to nourish *chensha* (cinnabar).

For *hantai geng* (mercury-containing lead), wrap each *liang* of large-grained cinnabar in gold leaf, press firmly, and arrange as before, covering and nourishing for a full seven days. Upon retrieval, the cinnabar retains its embryonic color, its radiance dazzling the eye, now infused with purple gold. If intending to pour mercury, divide the *Four Spirits Kui* powder into three portions. Place two portions in the vessel, tamp with a chopstick to form a cavity, line it with a layer of gold leaf, then pour mercury from a small kettle into the leaf. Cover with the remaining portion of *kui* powder and nourish for seven days as before. Each *jin* of the *kui* can, by the original method, nourish four *liang*, but prolonged use may deplete its power. If only three *liang* are nourished, the *kui*’s strength remains robust indefinitely.

During the first year, the *kui* requires a seven-day firing cycle. After one year, this may be reduced to five or three days. By the third year, the transformations reach the mysterious realm, and the elixir may be completed in a single night. Within three years, the *kui* accumulates abundant *qi* of gold and treasure, producing *zimo zhenjin* (purple-polished true gold), which may then be used for tempering and refining.

For this method, prepare *liusha* (sal ammoniac) and *pengsha* separately, grind them together, and nourish for seven days before retrieval. For each *liang* of mercury, place it in a water-grinding vessel, sprinkle a pinch of the *kui* powder on top, cover with a small dish, and seal the edges tightly with vinegar-soaked paper. Heat over a three-*jin* fire, and in an instant, it transforms into top-grade true gold.

This method has been transmitted orally from ancient times, never recorded in writing. I now compile and preserve it for posterity.

Within seven hundred years, this method may be transmitted to only three persons. One who obtains it may become the teacher of a nation. Observing this wondrous formula and its procedures—most simple, most easy—one seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Having obtained it, one must widely aid others and benefit all things; guard against reckless use or careless disclosure. Keep it secret, keep it secret.

**Supreme Great Medicine of Master Pu**
Transmitted by Ge Kejiu to Chen Shuzi, who received and passed it on.

First take one *jin* of sulfur from a foreign vessel, break it into pieces the size of soybeans, and take the bark of the *shuiyi* tree, scrape it into powder, and dry it in the sun. Steep it to make five *dou* of thick decoction, clarify it, and pour it into a large jar. Suspend the sulfur in a cloth pouch within the jar. Also use a fine-mesh basket, suspend it as a support inside the jar, add the decoction, and simmer over a slow fire for three *fu* periods, ensuring the fire is neither too strong nor allowed to fail. When done, remove the sulfur and dry it in the sun. Divide it into eight portions, and take one *jin* of the finest *geng* (refined metal), also divided into eight portions, to purge the mother *qi*.

First dry the *shuiyi* bark in the sun, then burn it to produce thick smoke, and fumigate fifty *liang* of it. Prepare eight crucibles, place them in a charcoal fire, and ensure they are stable. Then melt two *liang* of red *geng*, and when it becomes liquid in the smoke, quickly pour it into the fumigated crucibles. Also melt two *liang* of the processed sulfur and pour it onto the *geng* liquid. Immediately cover the crucible mouth with a tile, taking care not to delay, lest the *qi* escape. Thus, the *geng* is infused with sulfur *qi* eight times in eight crucibles. When cool, break the crucibles, remove the sulfur, and take one *jin* to serve as the *kui* for nourishing *geng*.

For the *shenshi* (spirit chamber) yin-yang furnace, the *geng* may only be used to forge the outer vessel; it cannot be used for the inner *shenshi*.

**Dead Yin-Yang Transformation Method**
Take one *liang* of yin yellow and four *liang* of yang yellow. Use *diyu* (sanguisorba), *xusuizi* (euphorbia), *lucao* (daylily), *bimazi* (castor bean), *shuiyangpi* (willow bark), and *yashecao* (duck-tongue grass), gathered from barren fields or shallow rivers where they grow like tongues beneath the water. Dry these six ingredients in the sun, grind them into powder, and simmer them to make four or five *dou* of thick decoction. Clarify it, pour it into a sand jar, and suspend the yin and yang yellow within. Add the herbal decoction and simmer over a slow fire for fifteen *fu* periods, ensuring the fire never ceases. As the liquid evaporates, replenish it until the allotted days are complete. Then take five *liang* of red *geng*, forge a *shenshi*, place the two yellows inside, and add five *qian* of dead *liu* (sal ammoniac) to mix with them. Forge another larger vessel, place the sulfur *kui* inside, and embed the *shenshi* at its center. Fill the space above and below with dead sulfur *kui* to ensure solidity. Seal the vessel’s mouth with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, then apply *liuyi* mud to seal it firmly, two fingers thick, and dry in the shade. Place it in an ash pit, apply fire at the *mao* and *you* positions, and nourish it for a full hundred days. When removed, grind the yin and yang yellows into powder. Use one *qian* to refine one *liang* of mercury, producing the supreme treasure of red *geng*.

**Dead *Liu* Method**
Take any amount of *liu* (sal ammoniac), and boil it with the natural juice of *cirujiao* (thorn apple) to render it dead. Alternatively, boil it with the natural juice of *tianzicao* (four-leaf clover) to also render it dead, which is even more effective.

**Refining Method**
Take one *liang* of mercury and place it in a crucible. Add one *qian* of the fully nourished two yellows powder, sprinkling it over the mercury. Then cover it with a small amount of transparent pine resin, and add three to five drops of fragrant oil. Cover the crucible mouth with a stable tile, ensuring no gaps, and surround the crucible with charcoal. Ignite the fire at the crucible’s mouth. When the sound within ceases and the crucible glows red, pour out the liquid—this is the supreme treasure. If it is extremely red, it may be added to silver to produce ordinary red *geng*. The refined product is *shenggeng* (sacred *geng*), with boundless transformations.

**Transformation Method**
Take six *liang* of refined *shengjin* (sacred gold) and cast it into a *shenshi*. Place two *liang* each of yin-yang and foreign vessel sulfur, ground into powder, inside. Also forge the *shengjin* into thin sheets, cut into checker pieces, and mix them with the three powders. Nourish with fire and seal for the required days, and the *geng* will be miraculously transformed.

**Another Method**
Take the two yellows, fully nourished with a hundred days of fire, and refine five *liang* into *shengjin*. As before, cast it into a *shenshi*, place the nourished two yellows inside, lining the bottom and covering the top. Nourish with yin fire for four *gang*, from one to five *liang*. Remove the previous yin-yang *kui*, and use one *qian* of nourished yin to refine one *liang* of mercury, producing supreme red *geng*. If not refined, take five *liang* of yin and place it in the sacred *shenshi*, lining and covering it to form a *kui*. Nourish the sulfur for four *gang*, from one to five *liang*. This nourished sulfur, one *qian*, refines one *liang* of mercury into supreme *geng*, with boundless transformations.

**Chen Shuzi’s Transmission of the Arsenic *Kui***
**Method for Nourishing *Fenshuang* (Calomel) and Refining Transformations**
Grind *ziheche* (purple river vehicle) into powder. For every one *liang* of arsenic powder, mix it with one and a half *liang* of *ziheche* powder. Place it in a crucible, heat it from gentle to intense fire, and render it dead to form a *kui*. This method for nourishing *fenshuang* is most effective, surpassing all others.

**Method for Ascending *Fenshuang***
For desiccated alum, use:
- One *liang* of mercury
- One *liang* of table salt
- Two *liang* of alum
- Six *qian* of saltpeter

Grind these into fine powder, add one *liang* of mercury, and grind together until no specks remain. Place it in a water-fire vessel, seal the seams with red halloysite, then further seal the mouth with *guan* mud. Scrape the seam with a bamboo strip, then remove the bamboo when dry, leaving a small hole called the "mysterious aperture." Heat the vessel to expel all moisture, then seal the aperture tightly with red halloysite. If this aperture is not left, the moisture inside will force its way out, cracking the sealed seams. Use one *qian* of the dead arsenic to nourish *fenshuang*, and refine one *liang* of bone—most wondrous.

**Method for Transmitting the Great Refining of *Fenshuang* and Transformation**
Take one *liang* of *fenshuang*, grind it, wrap it in double-layered silk, and place it in a bowl. Pour boiling water over it, rinse away the alum and medicinal residue, dry it in the sun, and wrap it tightly in *kunlun* paper.

Place a silver dish weighing one *qian* and press it tightly to ensure firmness. Take *chuanlangdu* (Euphorbia fischeriana), *zhuyazao* (Gleditsia sinensis thorns), *qumai* (Dianthus superbus), and *shiwei* (Pyrrosia lingua), each half a *liang*, grind them into powder, mix with refined honey, and form into a ball around the silver dish. Then take one *liang* of *zhangliu* root (Tamarix chinensis) and two heads of garlic, peel and grind them into a paste, and form another outer layer around the ball. Place it into a sealed container, set it upon half a *bo* (a vessel), surround it evenly with vinegar ash, and heat with five *jin* of charcoal from above. When the ash mound turns red, withdraw the fire. After the time it takes to eat a meal, reintroduce the fire, and once the fire has completely cooled, retrieve the powder to reveal the treasure.

For every eight *qian* of powder, refine five *liang* of red material—this is the *Danyang* Elixir of Bone-Transformation, a secret method.

**Urgent Refining of Arsenic Powder**
Take one *liang* each of arsenic and mercury, and one and a half *qian* of *pao* (processed arsenic). Grind them together until no specks remain. Place in an earthen pot, press salt on top, seal with a mud cake, and secure entirely with salt mud. Place in a black furnace. First, arrange two layers of hard charcoal at the furnace bottom, then set the earthen pot inside, pile charcoal around it, and ignite from above. When the pot glows red to the bottom, stir gently, and once the bottom turns fully red, remove it. Let it cool before opening. For every three *qian*, transmute one *liang*.

**Urgent Refining of Solitary Male for Transmutation**
Steep *yangtigen* (Rumex japonicus) for one *fushi* (a period of time), surround the crucible with slow fire, and add three *qian* of *gengmu* (lead mother) to form a liquid. Once cooled, use it to transmute materials.

**Method for Subduing Orpiment**
Steep *jichangcao* (Houttuynia cordata) juice for one *fushi*, then cover with dried herb powder and seal in a container. Heat with ten *jin* of fire, and once cooled, retrieve it. For every one *qian*, transmute cinnabar silver—this is the supreme treasure.

**Method for Preparing Yellow Sprouts**
Take five *liang* (or three *liang*) of lead essence, melt into cakes, or hammer into a *□* barrel. Add three *liang* of mercury, place the lead cake inside, leaving two *cun* of mercury above it, and seal tightly with *liuyi* mud. Cover the barrel’s opening with a water bottle beneath the shade. Nurture with three *liang* of gentle fire for seven full days. Upon opening, the mercury will ascend onto the lead cake, forming needle-like sprouts of fresh golden color—this is the first transformation. Add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture for another seven days; the medicine will turn golden. Do not remove it; add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture for seven more days. The sprouts will deepen in yellow hue, growing long and resembling wheat shoots. Repeat this process seven times, adding mercury seven times over forty-nine days, totaling twenty-one *liang*. This is called *Purple Yellow Sprouts*. As it transforms within the vessel, its forms and colors vary—it is the mother of *huandan* (returned cinnabar). From the lead mass, twelve *liang* can be obtained. Beneath the lead, there remains stubborn mercury of about three *liang*, while mercury that has sublimated onto the lid appears as red cinnabar, also about three *liang*, called *Solitary Cinnabar*. Collect this medicine, steam it with cow’s milk, and grind into powder. For every one *liang*, mix with jujube pulp to form a thousand pills, or one *qian* into a hundred pills. Take three pills on an empty stomach with wine daily. It greatly tonifies the lower *dantian*, stabilizes the heart and benefits the kidneys, calms the *hun* and settles the *po*, expels the Three Corpses and evil *qi*, cold diseases, wind afflictions, and chronic illnesses. Its myriad benefits cannot be fully enumerated.

**The Supreme Numinous Cinnabar Great Elixir**
*Preface by Yang Qin, Grand Master for Court Discussion and Military Commissioner of Nanjian Prefecture*

Gathering the essence of Heaven and Earth, the radiance of the sun and moon, one refines the Great Medicine. With fire, yin is burned to break through poison; when ingested, it strengthens sinews and bones, replenishes marrow and essence, slays the Nine Worms, severs the Three Corpses, sharpens hearing and vision, reverses aging to restore youth, revives the decayed and raises the dead, and extends years to prolong destiny—thus accomplishing the merit of the Nine Cycles.

Fearing that those who cultivate the elixir may waver in doubt and disbelief, I expound upon it in detail. Those who attain it must accumulate merit and virtuous deeds, benefiting beings and saving lives. The crucial point lies in meticulous preparation, unwavering from start to finish. It relies on the proper union of yin and yang, the mutual support of water and fire, the interplay of flying and latent child and mother, and the nurturing of metals and minerals to achieve transformation.

The interplay of flying and latent child and mother, the nurturing of metals and minerals, bring about transmutation. To shed the mortal frame and exchange the shell, to depart seated or standing—this is the *inner elixir*. The mutual support of water and fire, the supreme treasures of lead and mercury, refined without escape or sublimation—this is the *outer elixir*. Worldly people favor the outer but cannot perfect the inner; the enlightened cultivate the inner but refuse the outer. Only cinnabar unites both within and without.

When chickens consume it, they become phoenixes; when magpies eat it, they turn into simurghs; when dogs ingest it, they transform into dragons; when humans take it, they ascend as immortals. Its merit is profound, and only then is it transmitted. Its workings are unfathomable, its transformations immeasurable. The aged who consume it regain youth; the dead who receive it are reborn.

Once the Numinous Cinnabar is completed, white whiskers are pinched away, replaced by black. When the Numinous Cinnabar is refined with milk, the milk reverts to blood—this is the inner vision of the Numinous Cinnabar. It requires no obscure medicines, no rare herbs. Its use is economical, its merit simple yet unburdened. At the outset, lead’s color shifts; with the advance of fire, mercury’s body dries. Enhanced with mineral medicines, augmented with a close-fitting vessel, a thousand years’ qi is fulfilled in a single day. The treasures of mountains and marshes are completed in seven days.

Ten *liang* can transmute a hundred *liang* of lead; one *jin* can desiccate a hundred *jin* of mercury—this is the outer vision of the Numinous Cinnabar. Transmitted by former sages, expounded by later sages, inscribed on jade tablets, and concealed in divine repositories, it must be hidden in sacred mountains and passed only to the most worthy. It began with the Supreme Lord bestowing it upon Master Xu, who transmitted it to Immortal Ge, who passed it to the Master of Embracing Simplicity, who conveyed it to the Perfected One of Western Florescence, Master Lü, who entrusted it to Attendant Gentleman Zhang, who bequeathed it to Ren Baoqu. Baoqu refined its methods in the past, while Zhang Zhonghe expanded them in later times. Now, its origins and conclusions are complete, its beginning and end whole. Those who obtain it will elevate seven generations of ancestors; those who attain it will surely ascend the cloud paths.

The Way yields great utility in enriching the state and pacifying the people, while in lesser application it fattens households and adorns dwellings. Yet when beginners in cultivation or disciples of the furnace and fire first hear the wondrous formulas of Numinous Cinnabar, lingering doubts may arise, leading them into confusion and preventing awakening. Thus, I recount these matters again to clarify their origin, manifest the great Dao, and point directly to the mysterious mechanism, setting forth each step of the ninefold transmutation in full.

First, the medicine is boiled; next, the cinnabar is roasted. It is tempered in the Cauldron of Primordial Unity and nurtured in the Repository of Longevity. When the Forest of Jade arises, all superior adepts marvel; when the Tree of Jade blossoms, all celestial immortals rejoice. Therein mercury truly dies, and the treasure is revealed—transmuting the bones, encased in golden foil. What was once *geng* turns crimson; what was once *xin* turns white.

From this we observe: the method of Numinous Cinnabar, in its essential subtlety, harmonizes with the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. In its achievements, it fulfills the cultivation of sages and worthies. Extending its meaning, it aligns with the eight trigrams of the *Zhouyi*. Tracing its principle, it accords with the ninefold cyclings of the Old Master. Thus, its transformations emerge and vanish without limit, its movements—vertical, horizontal, curved, or straight—conform to all patterns.

The *Daodejing* states: "That which cannot be seen is called *xi*; that which cannot be heard is called *yi*." Hence, it is named the Way of *Xiyi*. This divine elixir is called Numinous Cinnabar, yet its meaning is one. The Perfected One of True Yang said: "A single grain of golden elixir determines longevity." This is that elixir. Though its names differ, its reality is the same. Sages and worthies of all ages cultivated this; the ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures likewise refer to this. Numinous Cinnabar is the steward of furnace and fire, the leader of self-cultivation.

Some may ask: If Numinous Cinnabar is so wondrous, why must it rely on the "mother" to reveal the treasure? They do not realize that swallows do not hatch phoenixes, nor do foxes and hares nurse horses. Solitary yin does not produce; solitary yang does not complete. Mercury is pure yin; lead is perfect yang. The *Yijing* states: "The alternation of one yin and one yang is called the Dao." Thus, it relies on the mother to reveal the treasure.

Now, when people of this world obtain Numinous Cinnabar yet cannot ascend lightly upon consuming it, or encounter obstacles in refinement, why is this? It is because their practice is shallow. The scriptures say: "Whether the divine is made luminous depends on the person." If it is not the right person, the Dao does not operate in vain.

Thus, if even a single medicinal substance, when properly subdued, can enable ascension to immortality, how much more so with Numinous Cinnabar? Those who obtain its method must cultivate utmost sincerity—for sincerity is the completion of practice. The noble ones who engage with Numinous Cinnabar, refining body and conduct, need not fear failing to ascend as perfected beings.

The required ingredients and the methods of preparation are reverently set forth below.

For those who refine the elixir and cultivate the Dao, one must first purify body and mind, burn incense, make vows, and invoke Heaven and Earth. Proceed with the elixir refinement in strict observance, aiming to benefit all beings and aid in their liberation. Only when free from demonic obstacles may one begin the work.

If sincerity is lacking and thoughts are wanton and unrestrained, the spirits will not protect you.

Master Zhang Zhonghe said:
*"Those who refine the elixir must know this well—
Without cultivating conduct, do not attempt the work.
Only when merit is complete and the task fulfilled
Will you believe the wondrous marvel of the elixir born into the world."*

**Method for Refining Numinous Cinnabar Elixir**

*Verse:*
Two eights unite yin and yang,
Examine closely in the Li Palace’s hall.
Who knows the true transformation?
The Weaver Girl weds the Cowherd’s son.

**First: The Method for Stir-Frying Numinous Cinnabar**
Take four taels of sulfur—preferably the finest imported variety, transparent and free of impurities. Soak it in the juice of *shuitian gongzi* grass (also called *tianzi* grass) for one *fu* period. If unavailable, substitute with *qumai*. Grind it into a fine powder, then boil it in river water. For one jin of mercury, add one tael each of *guanzhong* and *wubeizi*, along with two and a half mace of transparent pine resin. Grind them together, then soak in good rice vinegar and boil for half a day until it reaches a thick, paste-like consistency.

Remove the mixture and place it in a new iron pan. First, boil it with ginger juice for half a day, then wipe dry. Set it over a slow fire, melt the sulfur into a liquid, and then add the mercury. Stir slowly over a low flame with an iron spoon. If it forms clumps, pound them finely with a willow-wood mallet, then return to the slow fire to stir-fry. Under no circumstances should smoke or flames arise. If yellow smoke appears, immediately remove it from the fire. Do not stop stirring, and avoid impatience or haste. Do not sprinkle vinegar at any point. Violating this prohibition will bring grave consequences for the Numinous Cinnabar.

Stir-fry for a full day until it resembles aged bronze. When the Numinous Cinnabar is firm and solid, it will be free of stray mercury.

**Second: The Method for Crafting the Crucible and Tripod (omitted)**

**Third: The Method for Sealing Numinous Cinnabar into the Tripod**
Take ten taels of bronze and one tael of cinnabar—preferably in granular form. Grind the cinnabar to an extremely fine powder.

First, thickly grind good ink with strong vinegar and apply it to the bottom of the water tripod three to five times to ensure the Numinous Cinnabar can be easily removed later. Externally, mix clam powder and red halloysite with a small amount of honey, seal tightly, and secure with iron wire. Then, evenly coat the entire vessel with *liuyi* clay mixed with lead oxide. Allow it to dry thoroughly for a day and night before placing it into the furnace’s water tripod. Fill the tripod with water, then place three jin of charcoal beneath it to heat the base. When the water reduces by one or two cups, add two or three more jin of charcoal. Continue until the water has evaporated from three tripods, constantly replenishing the water and charcoal. After five *shi* periods, add five or six jin of charcoal for one firing, then wait until fifteen jin of charcoal have been used—this completes the fire cycle.

Cool the furnace, remove the vessel, and inspect the cinnabar. It should be hard and resonant. If the cinnabar is not firm and still contains oily mercury, it will fail to form the elixir, and the embryo’s color will not stabilize. Other issues, such as excessive consumption of the "mother" or various ailments, arise from improper subduing of sulfur and mercury, insufficient stir-frying of bronze, failure to use rice vinegar, uneven fire cycles, or insufficient fire intensity.

For further refinement, the water tripod must be replenished with hot water—never cold water. The fire should not be too high, and flames must not reach the seams of the water tripod.

The Most High said: *"True jia-geng is called bronze. When placed in the tripod and fired with fifteen jin of charcoal, the union is achieved, and the cinnabar’s body becomes solid. The fifteen jin of fire correspond to nine hundred years, the fifteen cycles of the Great Yang, and the number of the jia-zi. Thus, one day and night encompasses nine hundred years of transformation."*

Hence it is said: *"Numinous Cinnabar conceals the white, belonging to Kan. Its original color is red, belonging to Li. This is the union of Kan and Li, the completion of the alchemical process. Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth merge into one transformation, congealing to form the Great Medicine."*

*Verse:*
Five metals achieve union in Kan and Li’s palace,
Merging into one form, its body fundamentally red.
Wondrously endowed with the power of yin-yang’s union,
In ninety days of jia-zi, the work is complete in a single morning.

**Fourth: The Method for Boiling and Refining Numinous Cinnabar**
Burn young mulberry branches to ash and leach the juice. Take two taels of alum, two mace of realgar, one tael of Sichuan pepper, one tael of green salt, and three mace of chalcanthite.

Combine these five ingredients with the ash juice and vinegar in a new iron pan or a stoneware vessel. Place the Numinous Cinnabar in a fine, dense bamboo basket and suspend it within the medicinal liquid to boil for three *fu* periods. Once dry, stir-fry it, then bathe it in Sichuan pepper decoction.

*Question:* Why boil it?
The Most High said: *"When sulfur and mercury take form, they must truly die. This requires boiling and inversion. The five medicinal ingredients correspond to the Five Phases. Thus, it is called the method of boiling sulfur with Five-Phase mulberry ash juice—for when sulfur is inverted, mercury dies."*

*Verse:*
Yin and yang restrain each other, yet the treasure is not yet complete;
Only with mulberry’s green essence can poverty be averted.

Refining through nine transformations can transmute stone,
All by the mother’s power are the immortals revealed.

**Fifth Method: Refining the Lead-Sulfur Repository in the Floral Pool**
Take one *jin* of black lead and two *liang* of sulfur—translucent, shipborne sulfur is best; avoid that which has been boiled in paddy fields.

Place a clean iron pan over the fire and melt the lead into a liquid. Then take the prepared sulfur, grind it finely, and gradually add it to the molten lead while stirring continuously with an iron spoon. Let the sulfur blaze like fireflies in flight, or like stars appearing, then remove the pan from the fire. Continue stirring without pause until the sparks gradually subside. Return the pan to the fire, slowly sprinkle in the sulfur powder, and stir ceaselessly until all is incorporated. Once cooled, grind it into a fine powder to form the Floral Pool.

This is called the union of lead and mercury, where the two *qi* support each other, yin and yang conjoin, and *ying* and *wei* harmonize—thus obtaining water within fire, and yin within yang. Therefore, the Dao of longevity operates in endless cycles, its nourishment inexhaustible, its principle now made clear.

The Floral Pool of the *Gen* Dao is thus established.
Its application has its secrets.

**Sixth Method: Establishing the *Gen* Sulfur Repository**
Take four *liang* of prepared sulfur and half a *jin* of mountain marsh ore. Hammer the ore into thin sheets, slightly thicker, without regard to the number of pieces. Heat each sheet over a fire until extremely hot, then sprinkle the prepared sulfur powder onto it. Reheat and resprinkle until the sulfur turns a dark greenish-black, peeling like scorched cauldron fragments. Continue heating and sprinkling until the sulfur is fully embedded in the mountain marsh sheets. Then grind it into a fine powder and mix it with other medicinal ingredients to form the repository.

Take:
- Hematite, calcined seven times and quenched in vinegar until friable, ground to powder
- Pyrolusite, ground to powder
- Red crow’s foot, three ingredients, each four *liang*
- *Gen* sulfur, four *liang*

Grind the first three ingredients into powder. For every *liang* of *Gen* sulfur, use three *liang* of this mixture, blending them evenly to form the repository.

Next, take the previously heated sulfur and pure mountain marsh ore, grind them into powder, and use them as a body-adhering layer. Moisten the numinous cinnabar with vinegar paste, then apply the mountain marsh powder to one side. Then use high-quality mountain marsh sheets to wrap each piece, securing them tightly with silk thread. Remove the silk and place the bundle into the *Gen* sulfur repository, arranging them in a lotus formation and covering them with a layer. Next, fashion a divine chamber from mountain marsh ore. If unavailable, hammer the ore into round sheets, place them atop the *Gen* sulfur repository, then position the body-adhering cinnabar-sulfur layer on top. Cover it with another mountain marsh sheet, seal the edges with the Floral Pool, and bind it tightly with iron wire. Apply an outer seal, then place it into an ash jar. Add two *liang* of fire and nurture for two days. Increase the fire to two and a half *liang* and nurture for another two days. Then add three *liang* of fire and nurture for two more days. On the seventh day, add five *liang* of fire, insert it into the four directions, and nurture for one *fu* period. Once the seven-day cycle is complete, remove the cinnabar and discard the body-adhering medicine. Reboil the two ingredients:

- Chalcanthite, four *qian*
- Shipborne sulfur, eight *qian*
- *Huangyaozi*
- *Baiyaozi*, all ground finely

Grind the chalcanthite and sulfur into powder, then apply it to the numinous cinnabar and let it dry. Next, take the *Huangyaozi* and *Baiyaozi*, stir-fry them together over a low flame until they turn a purplish-black. Grind them into a fine powder, mix with vinegar paste, and apply it to the numinous cinnabar to moisten it, ensuring the medicine does not penetrate through. Then wrap it in Kunlun paper, bind it with silk, and place it into the mother repository for nurturing.

*Question:* Why use this medicine for the body-adhering layer?
The Most High said: *"This medicine is the very root of dead mercury. Using it to deaden mercury ensures absolute success."*

**Seventh Method: Warm-Nurturing the Mother Repository**
*Verse:*

Mother rectifies, child numinous—through them the transformations of creation flow,
Yet the numinous child does not cleave to the mother.
Let Southern Star be aided by *sanleng*,
Or if Black Dragon is used, let it too become a star.

Take one *jin* of superior mountain marshland, refine it according to method—either into millet-like grains or fashioned into a repository—and still employ a divine chamber.

*Question:* Why use a divine chamber?
The Most High said: *"Lest the upper and lower coverings fail to reach every part, the divine chamber ensures full and even enclosure. Moreover, it allows the cinnabar to fully absorb the mother’s robust qi."*

**Eighth Method: Warm-Nurturing with Fire Regimen**
*Verse:*
Gold and wood intermingle, entering the *bing* palace,
Know that *mao* and *you* may be compared as one.
Seven inquiries of the *Wei* maiden form immortal substance,
And once more the Liu lad ascends into azure emptiness.

Once the previous cinnabar is applied to the body and placed into the mother repository, arrange the lotus base, seal it properly, and set it into the ash pit.

**First day’s fire:** *mao* and *you* periods, two *liang* each.
**Second day:** three *liang* each.
Each subsequent day, add one *liang* more.
By the seventh day, increase the fire by half a *jin*, then nurture for one day.
Remove from the cold furnace, take one piece, wrap it tightly in the flesh of two half white plums, and roast in fire for the duration of a meal.
Then immerse in vinegar and examine—if it appears snow-white,
And feels light, the sulfur has departed.
Only mercury remains, and the mother suffers no loss or diminution.
If the inversion is not yet complete, remove the body-adhering layer at once,
For the color of the embryo will appear—this indicates the fire was too high, and the power did not penetrate fully.

Next, use rice vinegar boiled with alum to cleanse the mother repository, scrubbing it vigorously in the palm until dry.
Place it back into the vessel and nurture for three more days, with *mao* and *you* fires of five *liang* each—success is assured.

*Question:* Why bathe the repository in vinegar?
The Most High said: *"Lest the mother’s power weaken, this is to strengthen it further."*

*Verse:*
Without essence and radiance, the child does not vanish;
If the mother’s body is frail, the child cannot be born.
Failing to grasp the three essentials of the mysterious mechanism,
How can one achieve the great elixir’s completion?

For those with resources, use another *jin* of mountain marshland to craft a repository as before, and nurture for seven more days.
The cinnabar will be firm beyond compare, and when used for further refinement, its power vast.
After bathing, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood—this marks the first transformation, refining the precious into treasure.

**First Transformation: Refining the Precious into Treasure**
*Diding* flower is a single-stemmed yellow bloom.
If unavailable, *jindeng* root may substitute.
*Bajing* flesh
*Bimazi* flesh
The above in equal parts.

Take the previous numinous cinnabar, remove the body-adhering layer, and grind it into powder in an iron mortar.
Wrap it in Kunlun paper to form a ball.
Then take the three aforementioned ingredients, pound them into a paste, and encase the cinnabar within.
Place it into a large cinnabar vessel, layering it with salt flowers.
Puncture two or three thousand holes in the salt layer, place a lead cake atop, then fill the remainder with salt flowers.
Seal the mouth tightly, ensuring the entire vessel is secured, and let dry.
Set it into the ash pit, apply five *jin* of fire, and calcine for one night.
Cool the furnace, remove a piece—if it resembles silver frost—then fashion it into a repository.

*Verse:*
The numinous cinnabar, sevenfold returned, holds three vehicles,
The wondrous principle, transmitted by the master, must be clearly understood.
Black and white distinctly part, penetrating creation’s transformations,
Bathed in the flowery pond, one naturally ascends in flight.

Bathe the previous numinous cinnabar:
Use one *sheng* of rice vinegar, half a *liang* of green vitriol, and three *qian* of saltpeter.
Boil them together in a pan for one day until the transformation is firm—this completes the first transformation’s elixir head.

**Second Transformation: Shedding the Mundane to Enter Sagehood**
*Verse:*
No need for a mundane womb to nurture the sacred embryo,
Follow the prior method to carefully cultivate.
This time, shedding the body, one forms immortal bones,
And begins to sense depths unfathomable.

Take the previous cinnabar, craft another repository, and refine with one *jin* of raw cinnabar placed into the vessel for nurturing.
One *liang* of black pepper
One *liang* of *bibo*
Five *qian* each of *zhimu* and *beimu*

Use yellow vinegar to suspend the embryo and boil the pearl for one *fu* period.
Then bathe the pearl in pepper-infused water to cleanse it, and let dry before proceeding.

*Fen Shuang*
*Paosha*
*Eguanshi*
*Baijiaoxiang*
*Ku Mingfan*
Two *qian* each of the above five ingredients, ground into fine powder.
Mix with honey or vinegar paste, apply to the body-adhering layer, and place into the first transformation’s repository.
Arrange the lotus base as before, seal it properly, and set it into the furnace for warm nurturing.
The fire regimen follows the previous method.
When the fire is complete and the vessel opened, the elixir is formed—this is the sacred embryo,
For not a trace of mundane qi remains.
Nurtured thus to one *jin*, it must not be melted but only broken for nurturing the great medicine.
The repository method adheres to the four-one ratio.

*Verse:*
No need for mundane mediums—with a white body it forms,
Free from its womb’s qi, it awakens of itself.
All spiritual transformations arise from this,
In an instant, cinnabar yang transforms the bones, purifying them.

If one wishes to ingest it, bury it in earth for seven days to remove fire toxin, then form pills with wood honey.

**Fire Regimen, Subtle Method**
**First day:** one *liang*
**Second day:** one and a half *liang*
**Third day:** two *liang*
**Fourth day:** three *liang*
**Fifth day:** four *liang*
**Sixth day:** four and a half *liang*
**Seventh day:** six *liang*
On the seventh day, at the crown: three *liang*
East: three *liang*
Evening crown: three *liang*
West: three *liang*
**Eighth day** dawn crown: three *liang*
South: three *liang*
Evening crown: three *liang*
North: three *liang*

**Third Transformation: Nurturing True Yang**

**Verse:**
To lay the foundation of the great immortal elixir,
First capture and bind the Crimson Dragon’s child.
Refine it to a nine-by-nine pure yang body,
Then trust the marvelous transformations within the crucible.

Once mercury has become a treasure, it remains a solitary essence. Without true yang, it cannot undergo transformation. Use one *jin* of arrowhead cinnabar.

**Ingredients:**
- Sichuan pepper
- Wild aconite
- Arisaema
- Daphne flower
- Alum
- Halite
*(each one *liang*)*
- Chalcanthite
- Sal ammoniac
*(each five *qian*)*

Place in good rice vinegar and suspend in a womb-vessel to boil for three *fu* periods. Then boil in wild knotweed juice for half a day. Bathe in pepper decoction until dry. Grind thick, fine ink and pour into a tile dish. Wrap the cinnabar in layers, dry over a clean tile, then wrap again in ink and dry once more. Repeat this five to seven times, then apply *faxin* paste to the body, making it thick.

Take the second-transformation numinous cinnabar, melt it into powder, and place it in a sealed vessel. Seal the cinnabar with *lián* (lotus?) as prescribed. First, use three *qian*—or five *qian*—of numinous cinnabar, shape it into round discs, and place them atop the vessel’s contents. Then add *Huachi* powder, seal tightly, and place in an ash crucible. Nurture it with fire according to the previous method.

When the days are complete, remove and polish it. If it resembles the hues of mountains and marshes, it is done. If it still bears a reddish tint, apply fire for three more days—two *liang* each time—and it will surely be complete.

The vessel method follows the four-one ratio: nurture it four times, using one *jin* per vessel for washing and infusion. If not refining the ninefold orthodox elixir, one may instead nurture the second-transformation elixir head, creating a "Fountain of Longevity" vessel to nurture the mother cinnabar.

This is the Dao of "one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to the myriad things."

---

**Fourth Transformation: Infusing the Yellow Sprout**

**Verse:**
Wood-crystal gold-fluid meets cinnabar,
The numinous medicine’s cinnabar is truly praiseworthy.
Relying solely on its nurturing power,
It congeals into a crucible full of crystal sprouts.

Wood-crystal gold-fluid refers to the previous numinous cinnabar, while the cinnabar is the nurtured vermilion. As the *Cantong Qi* states: "Cinnabar is the essence of wood; when it meets metal, they merge."

Take this fire-tamed cinnabar, shape it into lumps, and place it in a sealed vessel to nurture for three days—three *liang* of fire each day. Open the vessel and infuse four *liang* of mercury, first filtered through three or four layers of tough paper. Pour it over the cinnabar, seal tightly, and place in an ash crucible to nurture. Follow the previous fire regimen.

After seven days, remove it from the cold furnace. The mercury will have dried, though sprouts may not yet have formed. If not refining the orthodox elixir, one may nurture numinous cinnabar in a vessel to cultivate mother cinnabar—this is called "morning planting, evening harvest."

**Verse:**

Once more infuse, once more nurture—mercury dries again and again,
The luminous Dao is clear, naturally unburdened.
Fire-tending gently, never in excess,
Open the furnace to gather radiant jade-like brilliance.

Once the mercury is nurtured, there is no need to pluck it. As before, infuse and nurture again. With twenty *liang* of the vessel’s contents, one may infuse five *liang* of mercury, following the previous fire regimen for seven days. Upon opening, the mercury will have awakened, surging forth jade sprouts like *langgan* jade.

**Verse:**
Jade groves and jasper trees rely on the third infusion,
Wondrous elixirs and rare blossoms grow ever more resplendent.
At this stage, preserve it wholly without slackening—
Firmly guard the resolve, steadfast in heart.

After nurturing mercury twice, the fire’s power must increase further.
Then infuse seven *liang* of raw mercury, seal tightly as before, and nurture with fire for seven days. Upon opening, it will gleam with radiant jade blossoms—a jade grove and jasper trees indeed. In total, one *jin* of mercury sprouts will have formed. Pluck them and name them "Divine Talisman White Snow," which may be used to nurture the Great Elixir.
If one merely plucks them, they may be enjoyed for boundless benefit.

**Verse:**
White Snow and Divine Talisman—how rare the encounter!
The Crimson Dragon revolves anew, guarding the Central Palace.
Clouds and thunder roar as the tripod boils for three days—
Then craft the supreme achievement of the immortals’ art.

**Method for Hardening the Sprouts**

Here the *jin* of mercury sprouts is finely filed and placed in a pan. Stir-fry with the lees of medicinal wine made from rice vinegar cakes for two *shi*-hours. Then sprinkle with medicinal water and stir-fry again. Afterward, place in a sealed vessel and nurture for twenty-one days until the sprouts become firm and potent, ready for fire-nurturing.

**Method for the Fifth Transformation: Granulating the Great Elixir**

**Verse:**
The Crimson Dragon subdues fire, called the Returned Elixir—
A secret held by immortals, rarely encountered.
Forty-nine days complete the work—
A single grain transforms mercury entirely.

Take the nurtured cinnabar sprouts, crush them, and place in a sealed vessel. Nurture in emptiness for fourteen days. Following the four-to-one method, infuse with mercury and two *liang* of fire, nurturing for forty-nine days. When the count is complete, open to reveal a jade grove and jasper trees. Remove the cinnabar as before, prepare a divine chamber, and take one *qian* of jade bamboo shoots to granulate one *liang* of mercury into the Elixir. Set up a bowl, place mercury inside, and sprinkle the granulated medicine on top. Seal tightly and place over fire—naturally, a cicada-like chirping will sound. When the sound ceases, it is dry.

**Sixth Transformation: Producing the Five Metals, Subduing the Three Yellows, and Refining into Treasures**

Take one *liang* each of the Three Yellows, grind together for one *fu*-hour, then add one *liang* of Jade Snow powder (the jade bamboo shoots). Grind evenly and place in a crucible, covering the top with half a *liang* of subdued fire sal ammoniac. Seal the mouth, apply nine *jin* of fire in three cycles, and refine. Remove from the cold furnace to obtain a single red Elixir. To test it, melt five *liang* of the Five Metals in a bright furnace and add one *qian* of the Three Yellows—all will transform into purple metal. At this stage, the work is complete, but one must proceed with careful measure. Only those of profound virtue and conduct may partake; one must also aid the poor and rescue the destitute. Cultivate the body and nurture life. If one relies on this for greed or excess, disaster will swiftly follow. Beware and take heed.

**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac**

Use half a *liang* of sal ammoniac and one *qian* of *tianqiezi* powder. Seal in a vessel and refine with one *jin* of fire. Remove from the cold furnace—it will be fully subdued. Grind finely and store in a sealed vessel.

**Verse:**
For the love of yellow blossoms gilding white frost,
What transformation is beyond comprehension?
The Three Primes receive the furnace’s snow—
Let not the foolish darkly speculate.

**Seventh Transformation: Sevenfold Returned Elixir**

Take eight *liang* of sulfur and two *liang* of mercury, grind until black. Then add one *liang* of the previously subdued Three Yellows and grind evenly. Place in a porcelain vessel, cover with three *liang* of the Three Yellows, seal the seams with red halloysite, and secure the entire vessel with salt clay. Once dry, place in an ash pit. Apply four *liang* of fire at the *mao* and *you* hours daily for seven days. Remove and grind into powder.

**Verse:**
The Twin-Braided Maiden naturally aids,
Reversing and returning in harmonious union.
When the medicine matures, transformation is complete—
Father and son unite without doubt.

**Eighth Transformation: Granulating Mercury into the Complete Eight Trigrams Metal**

Take five *liang* of the nurtured sulfur-mercury, add half a *liang* each of the finest raw Three Yellows and one *liang* of southern borax. Grind evenly, seal in a vessel, and place in an ash pit. Apply two *liang* of fire daily for twenty-one days and nights, totaling two *liang* of fire. When the count is complete, remove. Use one *zi* of this to granulate five *liang* of mercury into purple metal. If one dare not partake even at the sixth transformation, how much more should one fear the greater power of this stage? Only a man of destiny should proceed—how can one not be cautious?

**Verse:**
The Elixir completes eight transformations,
No further toil is needed.
A single grain of pure Yang medicine
Can refine the finest metal.
If one cultivates to this point,
Accumulate virtue and temper greed and wrath.
When merit and conduct fill three thousand,
One becomes a long-lived, ever-seeing person.

To ingest at each transformation, form pills with wood honey the size of *wutong* seeds. Take one pill on an empty stomach with flowing water. Upon completing the nine transformations, the methods are as previously listed. Since ancient times, cinnabar has originated from this.

**Ninth Transformation: Elixir for Reviving the Dead**

**Verse:**
Months deep in Elixir refinement,
Divine transformations are naturally entrusted.
What need for gold seals and purple sashes?
Bright moon and clear wind delight this life.

The Most High says: If one refines to this stage and ingests it, the mortal body becomes sacred, and old age returns to youth. One may build an altar on a blessed highland, use a jade-oil carriage to pay homage to the stars, and set up a tripod and furnace to refine the Great Medicine as prescribed. Mix paper mulberry juice with clay to coat the tripod, then add the Elixir. Place a water basin below, seal tightly, and place in the altar furnace. Apply five *liang* of fire daily for one hundred days. When complete, remove the Elixir and bury it three *chi* underground for one year. Someone may ask: Why bury it? The Most High says: To release the fire toxin. After one year, retrieve it and suspend it in a well for another year. Then soak it in flowing water for one year. After three full years, retrieve it, grind into fine powder, and form pills the size of chicken heads with licorice juice. Place in a furnace and nurture with fire for seven days. To test it, feed one pill to a chicken or dog—over time, they will transform into dragons or phoenixes. When humans ingest it, both form and spirit become wondrous, and one ascends in broad daylight. After forming the pills and completing the fire-nurturing, prepare several vats filled with freshly drawn water and place the Elixir inside. When the water warms, transfer it to another vat. Only then is the process complete.

**Method for the Nine Transformations of the Golden Sprout Tripod**

**Li Dongxuan’s Wondrous Elixir Secret Formula**
**First Transformation of the Golden Tripod**
Take ten taels of arsenic and divide into thirty packets. First melt two taels of black lead in a crucible until molten, then add the arsenic packet by packet, waiting each time until fully dissolved. After three or four packets, pour out the mixture, then add more arsenic as before until all is used. From ten taels of arsenic, only six taels will be refined. If a golden hue is desired, omit the lead.

The method states:
*To use lead or not—one must work within the lead.*
*Yet when lead is used, it remains an error.*

**Second Step: Calcining with Cinnabar**
Take five taels of cinnabar and mix with the five taels of refined arsenic, grinding finely. Place in a *jian* bowl, cover the surface with two or three *qian* of dead arsenic, and set in the furnace. When glowing red, use a bellows to melt into liquid. Sprinkle a small amount of raw arsenic to revive the dead arsenic, continuing to fan until the arsenic is exhausted and the liquid clears—this indicates the cinnabar is fully refined. Remove and cool, then break the bowl to retrieve the cinnabar. Re-smoke it to eliminate all arsenic, then pound into pieces the size of soapberries. Boil with the following medicines:

- Wheat bran salt
- Madder root
- Bitter bamboo
- Wolfsbane
- Pumice
- Magnetite
- Needle sand

Each one tael. Boil five taels of cinnabar in a sand pot for three *fu* periods until it turns black. Then rinse with boiling water sixty times—no less—soaking and grinding into powder to form a *kui*.

Next, take one tael of raw cinnabar in granular form, coat with gold leaf using vinegar, shaping like a lotus. Place in a porcelain box, seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, bind crosswise with iron wire, and dry. Set in an ash pit with two taels of fire at the top, nurturing for seven days. Repeat the nurturing as before.

**Third Step: Transmuting Copper and Iron**
Take two taels of plowshare iron, heat and shatter. Place a crucible with one tael of cinnabar at the bottom and the iron on top. Apply intense fire until molten—the cinnabar will ascend while the iron sinks, producing a sound like a woodpecker’s pecking. Wait until the sound ceases and the elixir is complete; do not pour out. Pour cold water over the crucible’s surface, and the cinnabar will naturally congeal into flakes on top. Break the crucible to retrieve it, while the iron below will have transformed into fine silver. Reuse the cinnabar in a furnace for further transmutation. The second and third transmutations may yield a bluish hue and greater hardness. Combine the first batch of silver and smoke it to achieve uniform color, producing superior silver—unlike anything in the mortal world, known as *elixir silver*. This is the supreme treasure of immortals. The method for transmuting copper is the same.

If the cinnabar is exhausted after the third transmutation, prepare a new *kui* and nurture mother cinnabar with raw cinnabar to form a treasure. Similarly, lead may be refined into silver without loss.

**Fourth Step: Transcending the Mortal to Attain the Sacred**
For every four taels of nurtured cinnabar, gather eight taels (or four taels) into one *kui*. Take raw cinnabar as before, coat with gold leaf, and nurture with fire for seven days. Retrieve and combine with the mother cinnabar in equal parts—eight taels or one *jin*—grinding together. Add one tael each of realgar and orpiment, grinding all three ingredients into the *kui*. Nurture with two taels of fire for seven days, yielding a total of ten taels, which are then refined into superior metal.

**Fifth Step: Gathering the Hun and Po**
If the previous ten taels of elixir do not refine into metal, prepare another *kui*. Take three taels of raw cinnabar, one tael each of granular realgar and orpiment, combine into lumps, coat with gold leaf, and nurture with fire for seven days as before, yielding five taels. Grind one tael, mix with one *qian* of fire-subdued borax, form into ten pills with yellow wax, and transmute one tael of *shan gen* into metal.

**Sixth Step: The Method of Using the Hun to Restrain the Po**
If the above fifteen taels do not transmute into metal, grind and add five taels of raw cinnabar, two taels each of realgar and orpiment, coat with gold leaf, and nurture with three taels of fire for seven days, yielding twenty-four taels. Take one tael, add one *qian* each of fire-subdued saltpeter and borax, grind together, form into ten pills with yellow wax, and each pill will transmute one tael of dry mercury into metal.

**Seventh Step: Refining Yang to Dissolve Yin**
The above twenty-four taels serve as the *elixir head*. If transmutation is incomplete, construct an elixir chamber and select an auspicious mountain site to begin refining the *Lesser Return Elixir*. Take the twenty-four taels of elixir, grind into a *kui*, and pour mercury in three stages: first two taels, then three, then five, each time nurturing with three taels of fire for seven days, yielding thirty-four taels. The elixir will gleam with purple-gold radiance, filling the room with brilliant fragrance. Bathe it in fragrant water, then nurture for another seven days, repeating the bathing process. After a full *jiazi* cycle and one month, the *Lesser Elixir* is complete.

Grind finely, mix with human milk and honey to form a paste, and shape into pills the size of tung seeds. Take one pill on an empty stomach with well-flower water. After ten days, the Three Corpses will depart, and all parasites die; chronic ailments will be cured. After a hundred days, hunger and satiety become irrelevant, and one is immune to plagues, miasmas, evil spirits, tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons. The Dao of immortality is thus achieved—this is the first step for the lesser adept toward transcendence.

**Eighth Step: Refining Qi to Attain Spirit**
With three taels of fire, take the aforementioned *Lesser Return Elixir*, place in a *kui*, and nurture for seven days, bathing once. After one full celestial cycle (one year), the work is complete, and the elixir will turn white, radiating light like a Buddha’s hair curls.

When removed, it fills the chamber with radiant light, and divine beings will guard it—mountain spirits and demons dare not face it. One must fast, cultivate goodness, and perform myriad virtuous deeds to preserve the elixir. Even those who obtain it should first accumulate merit and conduct before ingesting it, whereupon they may soar through the void and become earthbound immortals.

**Ninth Step: Refining Spirit to Merge with the Dao**
Use four taels of fire. Follow the method of bathing once every seven days, and continue for three years (one thousand days). When the work is complete and the tally full, golden light will break forth—this is the sign of success. One must invite accomplished Daoists to jointly safeguard it, and further perform rituals to honor Heaven and Earth. Without this, great demons will arise to wreak havoc, ruining the elixir and wasting one’s efforts. When the elixir is perfected, its color returns to yellow—this is the Way of returning to the origin and restoring truth. It first arose from the Yellow Sprout, and now, having reached completion, reverts to yellow. When grinding it, avoid exposure to sunlight, lest it ascend with the sun and scatter. It must be bound into pills with wood honey. If a single grain is scattered in a region, a thousand *li* will be blessed—evil spirits, demons, insects, tigers, droughts, and floods will vanish. If a single grain enters the body, one may wander the Ten Continents and Three Isles, attaining the rank of immortal, with a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. One may deliver the living and the dead, and with a thought, all wishes are fulfilled. Chickens fed with it become phoenixes, dogs transform into dragons, and myriad wondrous changes occur—its efficacy defies full description.

Those who study the Dao and learn of this elixir are all destined by past good deeds, not mere mortals of this lifetime. Wherever this elixir scripture arrives, divine beings will protect it. Those who lightly slander these teachings are but newly born into humanity, their fates constrained by meager destinies. If there are seekers bound by karmic affinity, they should offer sincere gifts of gold and treasure to receive this text, but never show it to the unworthy. Guard these precepts with utmost care.

*Gengdao Ji*, Scroll Three—End
*Gengdao Ji*, Scroll Four

**The Eastern Slope’s Three-Yellow Crucible Method: A Potent and Proven Technique**

Take purple-flowered motherwort, pound it thoroughly to extract its natural juice, and boil half a *jin* or one *jin* of sulfur in it without regard to duration. Cease only when testing reveals no ghostly flames or smoke. Place it in a sweet-pot crucible to melt and refine into an ingot, ensuring purity. If storing in a sealed box within an ash pit, use four *liang*. Nurture one *liang* of *yin* (female) for seven full days, then nurture one *liang* of *yang* (male). For larger quantities, nurture one *jin* or half a *jin* of *yin* and *yang*, maintaining a ratio of four to one. Replenish the yellow *yin* and *yang* seven times daily, each piece the size of a dice block, and nurture in a lotus-shaped arrangement.

To prepare the crucible, ensure the three yellows are evenly proportioned, reserving the sulfur. Take the nurtured *yin* and *yang*, and boil them again in mallow juice for three *fu* periods. Then, combine them with the three yellows, grind finely, and form into a crucible to drench with mercury. Use fine bamboo to create dozens of holes in the crucible, pour mercury inside, and nurture with fire for seven days. Upon opening the box, the mercury will have transformed into high-grade gold. The ratio is four pours of mercury to one. A wondrous secret—guard it well.

**Cinnabar Drenching Method**
Take half a *jin* of cinnabar and wrap it loosely in silk, securing it tightly. Place it in a sand pot with rice vinegar, suspending it above the liquid, and simmer over low heat for one *fu* period. Add four *liang* of finely ground Sichuan aconite, wild aconite, Sichuan pepper, black pepper, paulownia bark, coptis, dog spine, *dijin tian*, and eggplant herb to the vinegar, then boil for another three *fu* periods. Remove, wipe clean, and while still hot, swiftly wrap each piece in mercury sand, ensuring meticulous and tight wrapping. If any part is left uncovered, replace it with a new piece of cinnabar. Coat with honey, roll in paulownia bark powder, then in the herbal powder, and place in a box. Line the bottom with herbs, evenly spread the cinnabar, layering two or three times, and cover with more herbs. Mix red halloysite, dipsacus, and gypsum with vinegar, add *liu yi* mud, and seal with Kunlun paper, applying a two-finger-thick layer. Repair any cracks, then dry in the shade.

Bury a jar in clean ground, filling it nine-tenths with water, level with the surface. Place the box on top, sealing the seams with salt mud. Mix fine charcoal ash with vinegar and mound it around the box. Pile five *jin* of live charcoal on top, ignite naturally, and let the fire burn for two-sixths or seven-sixths of the time before covering with yellow earth. The next day, remove the box, clear away the herbal ash, and the cinnabar will have transformed into silver-like pellets.

**Mercury Sand Binding Method**
Take ten *liang* of fine silver and chisel it into five to seven pieces. Heat half a *jin* of sesame oil in a Jian ware bowl over low fire, add mercury and the silver, and cook until the mixture breaks into a hundred strands. Slowly add the fragments one by one into the oil, continuing for two *fu* periods until hard sand-like granules form.

**Drenching and Fire Secrets**
Take the calcined cinnabar and line the bottom of a porcelain box with the aforementioned herbs. Add a layer of paulownia bark, then arrange the cinnabar silver pellets (quantity unrestricted) on the herbal powder in a lotus-like pattern, layering two or three times. Pour two *liang* of mercury on top, add another layer of paulownia bark, cover with herbs, and nurture over low fire for three full days. Upon opening the box, all will have transformed into *hanlin yushu* (frosted silver trees)—harvest and store them. Repeat the drenching and nurturing process five times, after which the cinnabar’s golden essence will no longer require herbs for drenching. Add four *liang* of nurtured mercury to collect sprouts. For larger quantities, use mountain silver to form beads. If using herbs to cover, nurture the sprouts for seven days. For every *liang* of sprouts, nurture two *liang* of fine silver beads. First melt the silver beads, then add the nurtured sprouts to refine them into an extraordinary silver, suitable for crafting crucibles and universally applicable.

When the sprouts fail to transform into silver, return them to the cinnabar crucible and nurture through nine cycles to produce the Great Elixir. It can transmute alum into gold, and when calcined into a *dao gui* (knife-point measure), it becomes flying sand.

**Dragon-Tiger Crucible Method**
Take three *liang* of fine, luminous cinnabar and half a *liang* of sulfur, grind them together finely, and wrap in boiled silk, binding it tightly. Then take one *jin* of needle sand, wash it thoroughly, and dry it. Place a large sweet-pot crucible in a furnace, first adding the needle sand, then the wrapped medicine, and cover with the remaining needle sand, sealing the mouth. Fire it once until the contents turn to ash. Upon removal, the medicine will appear green—this is the Dragon-Tiger Crucible.

Grind two *liang* of this fire-tamed sand, add half a *liang* of raw cinnabar, and grind evenly with the tamed sand. Place in a thick porcelain box, seal it, and nurture in an ash pit for seven days. Open, then add another half *liang* of raw cinnabar, grind with the tamed sand, and nurture for another seven days. Repeat the process, adding raw cinnabar until three *liang* of tamed sand are nurtured in the box, following the same method. For every *liang* of tamed sand, one *fen* of raw sand is managed. When nurtured to five *liang* or half a *jin*, pour three to five *liang* of mercury into the tamed sand, seal, and nurture for seven days. The three *liang* of mercury will merge into the sand, forming granules. Add another two *liang* of mercury and nurture for seven more days, whereupon a white frost will cover the sand. This frost, when ingested, grants immortality and can transmute mercury into treasure. Continue adding mercury to nurture it, and the elixir’s wonders will be boundless. If raw sand and mercury are repeatedly added to the tamed sand, its marvels defy description.

The fire must not exceed four *liang*; this must not be rashly transmitted.

**Secret Formula of the Golden Elixir**
The art of the Great Elixir does not extend beyond lead and mercury. The medicines of lead and mercury form the foundation of the Great Elixir. Lead and mercury mutually stimulate and restrain one another, yet neither departs from the principle of Heaven and Earth, the female and the male.

Now, lead pertains to *yin*, its color black, and it is the Dark Warrior. In terms of trigrams, it occupies the *Kan* position, receiving the *ren* and *gui* waters of the north. Water generates metal, whose color is white, and it is the White Tiger. Its trigram is *Dui*, belonging to the *geng* and *xin* metals of the west.

Mercury pertains to *yang*, its color blue-green, and it is the Azure Dragon. In terms of trigrams, it occupies the *Zhen* position, receiving the *jia* and *yi* woods of the east. Wood produces cinnabar, whose color is red, and it is the Vermilion Bird. Its trigram is *Li*, belonging to the *bing* and *ding* fires of the south.

Thus, *Kan* is lead, water, and the moon; *Li* is mercury, fire, and the sun. When *Kan* and *Li* are conjoined, the sun and moon unite, lead and mercury contend, the dragon and tiger couple. Neither dominates in function, for they mutually restrain one another. Only when the Yellow Dame facilitates their meeting does one attain the realm of perfection, and the Way of the Golden Elixir is effortlessly achieved.

1. First, take four *liang* of pure lead from superior mountain marshes, melt it, and fan to collect four *liang* of lead flowers for the crucible—this is the foundation of the elixir.

2. Take one *liang* of cinnabar as the standard, add four *fen* of raw sulfur, grind finely, and place in the water-and-fire crucible. Following the usual method, refine the mercury seven or eight times. Remove from the cold furnace, grind finely, then add half a *qian* of raw sulfur, three *fen* of raw male [ingredient], and two *qian* of mother powder boiled with lead. Grind these together, place in a small pot, and press firmly. Use equal parts of soft gypsum and talc powder to seal the top, ensuring it is tightly packed. Cover the pot’s mouth with a tile, bind with iron wire, seal, and place in the *weiji* furnace. Apply fire for half a *fu* period. When cool, remove the dice-shaped pieces, wrap them in silk, place inside, and suspend in a clay jar. Simmer with gentle fire for three *fu* periods.

3. For boiling the medicine, use *shibi* lychee and *yangjiao* vine. Chop finely, boil, add one cup of fresh ginger juice, and mix evenly. Place the juice inside and boil the cinnabar for three *fu* periods. After boiling, take the two aforementioned herbs in their dried, raw state, stir-fry with the cinnabar pieces until the herbs turn black and charred, then blow them away. Add fresh herbs and stir-fry for a full day, then place in the herb crucible.

4. **Herb Crucible Medicines**
   - One *liang* of *cewu* leaves.
   - One *liang* of *tiejiao* *poluomen*, finely divided.
   - One *liang* of gallnut powder.
   - One *liang* of cardamom powder.

Mix the above ingredients evenly, then place them in a box, lining the top and bottom. Seal tightly and bury in an ash jar for three *yang* cycles. For the first day, apply three *liang* of fire in the morning and two *liang* three *qian* in the evening. The next morning, apply one *liang* seven *qian*. All should be top-fire. After three cycles, remove the cinnabar pieces, roll them in refined honey, then coat with lead frost and mother powder, pressing closely. Return them to the mother crucible. For every *liang* of cinnabar, use three *liang* of mother powder refined with lead, layering and covering the cinnabar in a small box. Seal tightly to form the inner box, then place it within a larger box. For each *liang* of lead flowers, mix in three *qian* of yellow lead and blend evenly. Grind finely with milk, then fill the inner box completely, pressing firmly to form the outer crucible. Seal tightly, bind, and place in an ash jar. Nurture with gentle fire for twenty-one days. When the time is complete, open and inspect—if not yet "dead," nurture for another seven days, and it will be truly dead. Apply two and a half *liang* of top-fire for three days; three *liang* of top-fire for three days; three and a half *liang* of top-fire for five days; four *liang* of top-fire for five days. From the sixteenth to the twentieth day, apply four *liang* of top-fire, with three *liang* inserted in three directions. When the days are complete, remove the cinnabar—it will be truly dead. The mother must be saved each time before making another crucible. For each *liang* of mother, add three *qian* of mercury in a small box, seal tightly, and nurture with one and a half *liang* of fire for four or five days in an empty cycle. Then add the mother to the cinnabar and nurture again as before until the days are complete. The mother is then reused as before to nurture the cinnabar once more until the days are complete. The mother is again mixed with mercury and nurtured empty for three to five days. Then, as before, nurture the cinnabar once more until the days are complete. For three *liang* of mother, nurture one *liang* of cinnabar in the first cycle, another *liang* in the second, and another *liang* in the third, totaling three *liang* of cinnabar. Combine all, pound to break, then grind six *liang* of cinnabar finely with six *qian* of raw sulfur. Place together in a water-and-fire cauldron, seal tightly, and apply great fire for one *yang* cycle to form a molten mass. If any stray mercury remains on the water cauldron, scrape it off, then break the cauldron to retrieve the cinnabar. Pound it finely, then place in a clay vessel to stir-fry the cinnabar until red, removing the sulfur fumes. As the *Dan Jing* states: "Stir-frying with sulfur to harden"—this is it. Then return it to the original nurturing mother, using six mothers to make a crucible. The *Dan Jing* says: "Seek the living mother again to nurture together"—this is the harmony of the Four Symbols. Then nurture the bare cinnabar, which is the Way of the Infant and Elder Brother. For cinnabar that is lustrous and crystalline like a wall, use the previous method with herbal medicines for boiling and refining, then place in the herb crucible and nurture for seven cycles. The methods, fire phases, and durations remain the same as before, with no additions. When complete, remove the cinnabar, wash with water until clean, then roll in refined honey and coat with lead frost, pressing closely. Place in the mother cinnabar crucible, layering with lotus petals. For example, if using half a *jin* of dead cinnabar, use half a *jin* of the original nurturing mother to make the crucible, nurturing the bare infant—cinnabar—with up to four *liang* of cinnabar. Thereafter, make the Longevity Crucible. Apply one and a half *liang* of top-fire for fifteen days, increasing to three *liang*, with only top-fire for a total of twenty-one days. Open to inspect if it is truly dead. If there is a slight smoke, remix evenly, then layer with lotus petals as before, seal tightly, and nurture with three *liang* of fire for five to seven days—then it will be truly dead. When nurturing the Elder Girl, though the Infant and Elder Girl share the same origin, their forms differ. The Elder Girl has not yet given birth, while the Infant has already formed essence. Once the Infant is born, it is divine, numinous, communicative, and transformative, with boundless applications. When the husband and wife—Infant and Elder Girl—cohabit: two *liang* of cinnabar is the Infant, four *liang* of powder frost is the Elder Girl. For the powder alone, wrap in paper, then in silk, and suspend in a clay jar. Use *diding* herb, or purple river vehicle, or lotus leaf ash, and juice in a clay bottle. Simmer with gentle fire for two or three *fu* periods to remove the salt and alum fumes. Then grind finely with dead cinnabar, mix with paper mulberry juice to form a paste, and shape into cakes, each weighing about one *qian*, pressing tightly. Wrap each cake in two layers of black crucible paper, place in a small box, pressing firmly layer by layer. Cover the top with mother-made rhombus pieces to prevent any leakage. Then place another layer of black crucible paper on top, press the head with good dead arsenic, bind with iron wire, seal tightly as before, and place in the Uncompleted Cauldron to nurture with fire. The Elder Girl, in heaven, is white snow; on earth, the dark gourd; in humans, powder frost. Immortals compare her to the Elder Girl—nothing more than mercury. Born from the womb of living cinnabar, she is the essence of mercury and the blackness of cinnabar. Stirred, she does not cloud; settled, she does not clear. Born in the crevices of high mountains, nothing can obstruct her form. Gentle, bright, and pure, chaff cannot sully her substance. This is the medicine of longevity, the treasure of transmutation, the world’s most precious thing—nothing compares. In the Uncompleted Cauldron, fire above and water below, all with top-fire. From the first to the fifth day, one *liang*; from the sixth to the tenth day, one and a half *liang*; from the eleventh to the fifteenth day, two *liang*. When the days are complete, transfer to the Bright Departure Cauldron to nurture. Remove the cinnabar powder, and for each *liang* of cinnabar powder, use two *liang* of bare cinnabar to make the crucible. Place the cinnabar powder cakes in a small box, layering with lotus petals, then cover with gold crucible paper. As before, cover the surface with sacred silver pieces, press the head with honey-dead arsenic, seal tightly, and place in a large crucible box. Fill the exterior with arsenic and sulfur, seal tightly, and place in the Bright Departure Cauldron. On the box, make an iron wire cover, about half an inch high above the box, to serve as a standard. Place in an ash jar to nurture with fire. When changing the fire, apply it only to the cover, so the fire’s height will naturally be regulated.

The Bright Departure Cauldron and its top fire. Nurture for one seven-day period with three *liang* of fire. For the next seven days, three and a half *liang* of fire. For the following seven days, four *liang* of fire. For the next seven days, five *liang* of fire. Within the first seven days, maintain three *liang* of top fire, inserting eleven *liang* in three directions. When the days are complete, open and inspect—true death of the powder is the standard. If smoke or flame appears, nurture with fire for another seven days, and it will truly die.

For example, if the nurtured cinnabar powder frost amounts to six *liang*, adjust the size of the crucible accordingly. If there are six *liang*, extract four *liang* of cinnabar powder and store separately. For the remaining two *liang* of cinnabar powder, mix with two *liang* of raw powder, also forming cakes, and place in the previous cinnabar crucible. Nurture with fire as before until the days are complete. Then remove this cinnabar powder and combine with the previously stored four *liang*, totaling half a *jin*, to serve as the Jade Field Crucible for nurturing White Snow.

**Jade Field Crucible Standard: Half a *jin***
Take four *liang* of raw powder, break into pieces the size of soybeans, and boil with lotus leaf ash or soap bean ash infusion for one to two *fu* periods using slow fire. Coat with raw *cizhong* powder and lead white frost mixed with vinegar, applying it to the dead powder. Then place in the Jade Field Crucible, layer with lotus, seal tightly, and nurture with slow fire for fifteen days—it will truly die. If not, nurture for another two or three days, and it will truly die.

At this stage, use two *qian* to transmute one *liang*, forming treasure. When the days are complete, remove it. Fire regimen and top fire:
- One *liang* of fire for five days.
- One *liang* and two *qian* of fire for five days.
- One *liang* and five *qian* of fire for five days.

When the days are complete, remove and obtain four *liang* of White Snow for storage. Add another four *liang* of raw powder, also boiled with lotus leaf ash infusion for two *fu* periods. Coat with raw *cizhong* and lead white frost as before, then place in the Jade Field Crucible and nurture for thirty-five days. At this point, obtain half a *jin* of White Snow, named the White Snow Crucible, for nurturing the Divine Talisman Great Elixir.

**White Snow Crucible Standard: Half a *jin***
Take four *liang* of raw powder pieces, break into small soybean-sized chunks, and boil with ginger juice, lotus root juice, and half a *qian* each of raw *cizhong* for one *fu* period. Remove, wash clean, coat with White Snow, place in the White Snow Crucible, seal tightly as before, and nurture with fire in the Bright Departure Cauldron. Fire regimen and top fire:
- One *liang* of fire for five days.
- One *liang* and two *qian* of fire for five days.
- One and a half *liang* of fire for five days.

When the days are complete, remove and obtain four *liang* of Divine Talisman for storage. Add another four *liang* of raw powder, boil with lotus root and ginger juice for one *fu* period, then boil with raw *cizhong* as before. Coat with White Snow, place in the White Snow Crucible, and nurture with fire for fifteen days until it truly dies. Obtain another four *liang* of Divine Talisman, totaling half a *jin* for the crucible.

**Divine Talisman Great Elixir Longevity Crucible**
For half a *jin* of Divine Talisman, take four *liang* of cinnabar mercury, shred with paper, and use a goose feather tube to pour the seed into the Divine Talisman Crucible. Nurture with one *liang* of fire for three days to form Jade Sprouts. Extract these sprouts without boiling or washing, shape into dice-sized pieces, and place back into the crucible. Nurture with fire as before for fifteen days to form the Supreme Treasure. One *qian* transmutes one *liang* of base metal into Supreme Treasure, and one *qian* can dry one *liang* of mercury into Supreme Treasure. Proceed thus in stages without end—this is the Longevity Great Medicine, perpetually unbroken across generations.

**Danyang Bone-Transmuting Method**
For dead arsenic, grind purple river vehicle into powder. For each *liang* of arsenic powder, mix with one and a half *liang* of river vehicle powder, blend evenly, and place in a sweet pot. Heat from mild to intense fire to instantly kill, then form a crucible. This method is most efficacious for nurturing powder frost, surpassing all others.

For refined powder frost, boil and coat with raw male essence, then place in the crucible to nurture. Ingredients:
- One *liang* of mercury.
- One *liang* of salt.
- Two *liang* of alum.
- Six *qian* of nitre.

First grind the three ingredients into fine powder, add one *liang* of mercury, and grind until no stars remain. Place in a water-and-fire vessel, heat slowly from mild to intense, until four cups of water have evaporated. When cool, remove the next day—all will have ascended to the bottom of the cup. Remove, boil with lotus leaf ash infusion for one *fu* period, and wash with boiling water several times. Then remove the alum flavor, place in the arsenic crucible, layer with lotus, and nurture for two seven-day periods. Fire regimen:
- First day: two *liang* of fire, top fire in the ash pool.
- Second day: two and a half *liang*.
- Third day: two and a half *liang*.
- Fourth to sixth day: three *liang*.
- Seventh to tenth day: three and a half *liang*.
- Tenth to fourteenth day: four *liang*.

Remove and test over fire. If not subdued, nurture for another seven days.

**Alternative Method**
For dead arsenic, boil with natural spinach leaf juice for one *fu* period to instantly kill. Use *tuoti* teeth (i.e., northern *huihui* calamine) ground into powder, mixed with northern date pulp, and pounded into a paste. Coat the bottom of a sweet pot, shape like a pot, and dry in the sun. Then place one *liang* of bone and one *qian* of dead arsenic on top, cover with *tuoti* date paste, fill the pot with salt, and heat from mild to intense until the pot glows red. Remove to obtain top-grade silver.

**Cinnabar Crucible Pouring and Drenching Method**
Fire regimen: civil and martial fire from top to bottom. Fire control is crucial for the sealing method—this is the first and foremost divine verification of the elixir path. Guard it well; intense fire will cause primordial leakage.

Grind one *jin* of *shan* (realgar), half a *jin* of *hu* (tiger bone?), and half a *jin* of mixed powder evenly, sift finely, add well-flower water, and pound with a stone pestle a thousand times until it becomes a glue-like paste for sealing.

**Oil Method**
Select fine, blue-white porcelain shards, grind them to powder, place in an iron pan, and stir-fry over intense fire. Add equal parts bamboo leaves and rush pith, continuing to stir-fry until the porcelain turns to ash. Sift through fine silk, then mix with well-flower water to create an oil-water sealant. Apply this oil to the surface of the accumulated medicine—aged oil is best. For sealing the mouth of a crucible: first twist *tangxin* (arsenic trioxide) into paper strips with tapered ends, insert tightly into the seam, then apply the aforementioned paste to level it. Brush the surface with oil-water, wait a day for it to dry, add another layer of paste, and finally seal with salt-clay. For sealing the bottom of a crucible or any sand holes or small pores that may leak medicine: first apply a thin, water-diluted layer of paste, then line with two or three layers of *tangxin* paper. Apply the paste to a thickness of two or three *fen*, brush with oil, and finally seal with salt-clay. All superior sealing methods derive from this—top-grade, top-grade.

**Elixir Method**
Take half a *jin* of cinnabar and suspend it in good rice vinegar, gently simmering for three *fu* (forty-day periods). Then add four *liang* of powdered herbal medicine and continue simmering until dry. Remove, wipe clean, and while still hot, quickly wrap each piece of cinnabar with mercury sand as prescribed. Any piece left unwrapped will be ruined. Once wrapped, coat with honey, sprinkle with *wutonglü* (paulownia twig powder), apply another layer of honey, then dust with herbal powder. When dry, line the bottom of a box with herbal medicine, arrange the cinnabar pieces evenly, cover with another layer of herbs, then another layer of cinnabar, repeating three to five times until full. Seal the box’s seams with red halloysite clay, patching any damaged areas, and let dry in the shade. Then reinforce externally with salt-clay and dry again in the shade. Bury a jar in a clean place, filling it with water to nine-tenths capacity, its mouth level with the ground. Place the sealed box atop the jar, seal the junction between box and jar with clay, and mound vinegar-mixed ash around the box. Pile five *jin* of charcoal around it, ignite naturally, and when the fire reaches six or seven-tenths intensity, cover with yellow earth. The next day, remove the herbal ash to find the half-*jin* of cinnabar transformed entirely into silver-like pellets.

**Herbal Ingredients for Cinnabar (Half-*Jin* Cinnabar Requires Half-*Jin* Each of the Following):**
Aconite (*chuanwu*), wild aconite (*caowu*), black pepper, Sichuan pepper, coptis, *gouji* (cibotium), *nanxing* (arisaema), pinellia, *wutonglü* (paulownia twig powder).

**Method for Wrapping Cinnabar with Mercury Sand**
Take five *liang* of mercury and five *liang* of silver foil, divide into three to five pieces, and place in sesame oil. Gradually transfer to a crucible and heat until amalgamated. Remove the mercury-silver sand, repeat the process until all mercury is exhausted.

**Verse on Pouring and Nurturing Fire After Cinnabar Transformation**
Lead sand resists fire, no smoke remains,
A swift path to the Elixir’s alchemical gains.
Nine herbs within the crucible confined,
A single lead without—its power enshrined.
Lead leaves its mother, child follows wife,
Transcending the mundane, the Dao’s subtle life.
Once cinnabar submits to fire’s embrace,
Behold: mercury dries without a trace.

**Method for Completing the Great Elixir Through Pouring**
Take the transformed cinnabar, line the bottom of a vessel with the aforementioned herbs, then add a layer of *wutonglü* powder (quantity as desired). Arrange the cinnabar evenly in two or three layers, then pour mercury over it. Begin with two *liang* for the initial nurturing, sufficient for three days. Upon opening, the contents will resemble a forest of jade trees in winter—gather and grind them to an extremely fine powder. Repeat the process: line with herbs, arrange cinnabar, sprinkle the gathered "winter forest" powder evenly over the cinnabar, then pour another two *liang* of mercury. Repeat the gathering, grinding, and layering, ensuring the mercury is absorbed into the "winter forest" powder rather than the cinnabar. After five iterations, the cinnabar will grow increasingly potent, eliminating the need for herbal lining—thus forming an immortal crucible. For pouring, add four *liang* of mercury to cultivate "sprouts." To produce more "mountain silver smoke" as beads, or if using pre-subdued white灵砂 (mercury sulfide) resembling lotus seeds, nurture one *liang* of sprouts with two *liang* of it for seven days to yield top-grade immortal silver, a metal beyond the ordinary. It can be used to refine *geng* (lead) into a crucible, nurture the Three Yellows, or produce yellow sprouts for transmuting *geng*. With prolonged mercury application, it becomes high-grade purple gold. If not used for a crucible, place it in a cinnabar vessel and nurture it nine times to become the supreme Elixir. It can transmute base metals, copper, iron, and the Eight Stones into gold; ingesting a *daogui* (knife-tip measure) will make one immortal.

**Method for True Dead Cinnabar Juice Crucible and Pouring to Form the Great Elixir**
Found abundantly in the western mountains, also called "golden lotus herb." Take any amount of cinnabar and *huanghua jichangcao* (yellow-flowered chicken-intestine herb, also called "step-by-step lotus" or "immortals sitting face-to-face grass"). Pound to extract juice, simmer the cinnabar for three *fu*, then dry it. Wrap the cinnabar in the herbal residue, encase in *kunlun* paper, and seal externally with salt-clay. Dry, then heat from mild to intense until the vessel glows red. After prolonged cooling, open to find the cinnabar truly dead—unaltered by fire. Alternatively, wrap the cinnabar in herbal residue, place in a vessel, pack tightly with yellow clay, seal the seams with oyster shell powder, and nurture with two *liang* of fire for seven days to achieve true death. Then mix with realgar, orpiment, and lead yellow flower (one part to ten parts cinnabar), add three parts juice, grind uniformly with the cinnabar, heat a crucible until red-hot, add the medicine, and fan with intense fire until it melts into liquid. Once cooled, it becomes a treasure.

To refine mercury, use four parts to one. Add it to the previous elixir, nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days, and the mercury will die and sprout buds. When pouring to stack and nurture the buds, take as much as desired—all will become supreme treasures, entering the *geng* Dao.

**Method for Obtaining Lead Yellow Flower**
Alternatively, knead the stems and leaves of *linglingxiang* into small balls and place them in the juice. If the juice does not form, add one *liang* of yellow lead, pack tightly into a crucible, and heat until red-hot. Pierce a hole in the center with an iron rod, insert a white aconite, and fan with intense fire until the elixir melts into liquid. After prolonged cooling, open the crucible to retrieve the lead yellow flower, its color fine, equal to two parts orpiment. The lead residue at the bottom of the crucible may weigh two or three *qian*, resembling silver. Then place the previously dead cinnabar into the crucible, melt the settled lead into liquid, pour it over the cinnabar, and heat—all will become a supreme treasure. Wondrous, this is the art of immortals.

**True Dead Cinnabar to Transmute Lead into Silver and the Pouring Method for Vault Heads**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar. Boil it in a small bowl of natural juice from pounded *yege* until dry. Then wrap the cinnabar in the herbal residue, place it in a jar, pack tightly with the residue, seal externally with spirit clay, and dry. Heat with three *jin* of charcoal fire. After cooling in the furnace, the cinnabar will be truly dead, not diminished by a single fraction. For every *qian*, transmute one *liang* of pure lead into red-colored silver, resisting fire to become a true treasure. It may also transmute base metals. Alternatively, pour mercury into a vault to nurture it, and the "Laughing Jade of the Cold Forest" will form into the Great Elixir.

**Another Method**
Grind *guibeijianghuang* and *tiannanxing* into powder. Boil cinnabar with them for three *fu*. Then mix the fine powder with honey, wrap the cinnabar, place it in a crucible, and heat—the cinnabar will be truly dead. Next, combine with *jindingpi* and melt into liquid, or use dead *pengsha* alone to achieve the same. Alternatively:

**Method for Dead *Pengsha***
Spread powdered *zhimu* on the bottom, place *pengsha* in the center, and cover with more *zhimu*. Heat until it melts into liquid for use.

**Another Method**
Wrap three to five layers of cinnabar in *xiazhucao*, bind with iron wire, and place in a vessel. Use *baizhi* and *caowu* as auxiliary powder, stir-fry the wrapped cinnabar until ready, then grind into fine powder. Mix with rice vinegar into a paste, line the bottom and top of a crucible, seal the mouth with a clay lid, bind with iron wire, and seal tightly. Heat with three *jin* of fire. After a long while, remove and cool—the cinnabar will be truly dead, its original color unchanged. Most wondrous, it transmutes substances, nurtures cinnabar in a vault, or pours mercury. Secretly transmitted by the "Undying Yang Lord," after nurturing the "Sun and Moon Elixir" in a vault, pouring mercury yields the Great Elixir.

**Refining Sulfur**
Take one *liang* of good sulfur, pound into powder. First boil with *wubeizi* for a day, discard the residue. Then replace with *huangqin*, *huanglian*, and *dahuang*, decoct into a thick juice, and boil for two more days until fully subdued. Next, use *wubeizi* to blacken it. Mix with egg white, first coat the inside of a box once. Then blacken again and coat two or three more times. Place the sulfur inside and nurture for seven days—its color will resemble yellow gold. Use this to further nurture *song* into a "Spiritual Sage Vault," and nurture the "Two Yellow Elixir Heads" for fourteen days to succeed. Nurturing cinnabar thus yields endless transformations.

**Nurturing Cinnabar Spirit**
Take ten *liang* of subdued cinnabar as the base. Retrieve the treasure, grind into powder, and first form a treasure vault. Then gather five parts of "Mother Sand" and process each according to the method. For every *liang*, divide this sand into four or five rounds, arrange them like lotus petals in the treasure vault, nurture for seven days, then open to retrieve the mercury sand. Extract the "Old Man’s Beard," sift the dry mercury—white as willow catkins, forming strands—this is the true dead dry mercury, the treasure of elixirs and the essence of supreme medicine. Heaven and earth gain brilliance from it, all things gain spirit from it. This is the boundless transformation of creation, the eternal cycle of life, an everlasting plan. Though there are thousands of classics and ten thousand scrolls, none surpass this principle. Those who seek recklessly will find it difficult to align with the Dao.

**Mercury Pouring Formula**
First take the previously nurtured, visible treasure cinnabar as the elixir base, grind into mung bean-sized pieces—ten *liang* for example. First pour five *liang*, open once every seven days, reseal, and nurture for five more days. Retrieve the mercury, now firm and dry. Then take the remaining five *liang* of subdued mercury, refine for seven days, open, and nurture for another seven days. Retrieve this true treasure, the transformed dry mercury, named "White Snow Divine Elixir." With ten *liang* of secret transmission, pour mercury to transform into treasure.

**Dry Formula**
Use ten *liang* of the previously nurtured cinnabar spirit as the base, lightly crush, and collect with subdued mercury. Use *yangtigen*, *longdancao*, and *duniuxi*. Boil the mercury with the spiritual herbs, pour the subdued mercury onto the base, and pour four *liang* of this subdued mercury from heaven, opening after seven days. Then pour three *liang* of subdued mercury from earth, nurture for seven days, and open—do not pour this mercury at this time, but nurture for five days before removing. Add another three *liang* of poured subdued mercury, nurture for seven days, and open. Altogether, the original ten *liang* of subdued mercury and the elixir base total twenty *liang* of treasure. First use the original ten *liang* of subdued mercury elixir base for the furnace process, leaving this as the "seated womb mother." Then set aside the ten *liang* of poured mercury treasure, boundless in transformation, the great champion of the world.

**Subduing and Pouring Dry Treasure *Kun* Mercury**
Use a twelve-*liang* crucible, place two *liang* of the previously poured treasure mercury inside, with ten *liang* of raw mercury on top. Sprinkle two *qian* of true dead cinnabar to cover, secure externally with silk paper, and brush gently with *yangtigen* juice. Heat in the crucible, gradually subduing until soft and pliable. Then remove and place on the ground, cool, open, and retrieve the treasure—twelve *liang* in total.

Use a single clay tile to cover securely, binding and sealing it tightly within. Then take the dregs of *yangtigen*, pound them into a paste, and smear them thoroughly over the seal. Bury in a pit in a shady spot, pile charcoal around it, and ignite a top fire. After one night with the lower crucible in place, remove and pass through the barrier—thus the treasure is formed.

The classic states:
When mercury dies, then mercury dies again,
Dead mercury, ah, dead mercury.
Living mercury transforms into true guest mercury,
As you command, its wondrous transformations reach the divine.

**First Transformation**
This wondrous method begins by uniting two substances of cinnabar spirit, placing them in an alum matrix as the chamber, and nurturing them until the treasure appears for use.

**Second Transformation**
Within the cinnabar spirit chamber, nurture the mother cinnabar until the child is born. When the aged *xi* must emerge, it gathers the qi of heaven and earth, forming cinnabar and dry mercury.

**Third Transformation**
Take the aged *xi* whiskers obtained, accumulate them as the chamber, and pour subdued mercury to grow jade shoots and jasper branches.

**Fourth Transformation**
Combine the previous jade shoots and jasper branches with the aged *xi* whiskers in equal parts to form the sacred chamber, then refine them into cinnabar divine elixir.

**Fifth Transformation**
Use this cinnabar and blend it into the sacred treasure chamber.
Then nurture the yin and yang to create the great medicinal divine elixir.
These two transformations, when added to golden elixir immortal medicine, still fall short—only the latter two suffice.

A poem says:
Seven transformations of cinnabar, the work of creation,
The mortal womb now becomes a great immortal elder.
Clad in white, leaping beyond the Dragon Gate,
A great minister’s body commands all phenomena.
Sun and moon, heaven and earth lie in your palm,
Transforming into red, soaring as crane’s tracks.
The great medicine refined, gold within mercury,
As you command, its divine transformations abound.

**Elbow-Pouch Wondrous Medicine**
Use the previous sacred treasure chamber to first nurture four *liang* of powdery frost into pills. Divide each *liang* into five pills, then place them in the chamber for nurturing. Open once every seven days, and outside the chamber, condense three *qian* of mother cinnabar into one *liang*. Knead into cakes or balls, bind securely, and nurture for another seven days, opening twice. Then return them to the treasure chamber for a full seven days, and upon removal, they become white snow divine elixir—three *qian* subdues one *liang* of red silver.

**Smelting Cinnabar into Liquid for the Chamber**
Take one *liang* of *geng*-path cinnabar and half a *liang* of realgar, grind them together. Boil yellow flower and chicken-intestine grass for three *fu* periods, extract the juice, and mix with the cinnabar and realgar to form balls. Then wrap the balls with the boiled grass, coat externally with plaster made from gypsum powder and honey, and seal with refined clay. Once dry, gradually increase the fire from gentle to fierce until thoroughly red. After cooling, retrieve it—the cinnabar has truly melted into liquid. For use in the *geng*-path, apply gold leaf as adhesive medicine to each piece, then use lead white frost and realgar powder to stir-fry with the cinnabar. When the gold leaf merges with the cinnabar, place the medicine in the crucible, and with one firing, it becomes golden cinnabar, suitable for transmutation or as a chamber.

**Method for Dead Cinnabar**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar and *wanzhou* yellow medicine the size of a chicken egg (all others are not genuine), along with half a *liang* each of *qumai*. Grind them into fine powder. Then take fresh *yi*, pound it to extract the juice, and mix it with the two medicines to the proper consistency. Place half of this mixture at the bottom of the tripod, set the cinnabar in the center, and cover the top with the remaining medicinal paste. Gently press to level and compact it. Cover with two layers of damp paper, then seal with a water-filled dish, ensuring it is airtight and dry. Gradually increase the fire from gentle to intense, adding water as the charcoal fire burns. After the fire has thoroughly reddened the vessel, allow it to cool, then open—thus the cinnabar is truly dead.

**Another Method**
Take any amount of cinnabar, and use mulberry root bark, *gouqi* berries, *nanxing*, and *wutou* ground into a fine powder. Boil them to extract the juice, suspend the cinnabar in the liquid, and boil for three *fu* periods before removing. Grind *xipeng*, *daqing*, alum, *que*, and powdery frost into powder, then mix with vinegar to form a paste. Coat the cinnabar thoroughly, then place *peng* sand and table salt in the bottom of a sweet crucible. Set the cinnabar ball in the center, cover the top with *peng* salt to fill completely, seal with a clay tile, and ensure it is airtight and dry. With one firing, the treasure is formed, suitable for nurturing mother cinnabar in the chamber. After seven days, the chamber yields the treasure.

For the first and second days, use one and a half *liang* of fire.
For the third day, use two *liang*.

For the third, fourth, and fifth days, use two and a half *liang* of fire.
For the sixth and seventh days, use three *liang*.

**Another Method**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar and one and a half *liang* of *yimu* herb, along with sheep’s-hoof leaves. Grind these two into powder, spread them to line the bottom and cover the top, ensuring it is tightly packed, then seal and dry. Fire with five *jin* of flame for one firing. The sulfur is subdued into liquid.

Boil in rehmannia juice for seven *fu* periods, then cease the fire. If the cinnabar’s color remains unchanged and it liquefies upon heating, the rehmannia water will separate: that which floats is "heavenly yellow," that which is half-submerged is "human yellow," and that which sinks is "earthly yellow," indicating the loss of *qi*.

**Subduing Sulfur**
Use the natural juice of *daqing*, boil for twenty-eight days, and "nurture the pine to true death" three times before adding one *jin* of mercury. For each instance, add two *liang* of mercury to the sulfur, then replenish with fresh mercury for restoration. Do not allow contact with iron vessels.

**Another Method**
Use the natural juice of chive blossoms, boil in a ceramic vessel for seven *fu* periods, and it will immediately die. "Nurture the pine to true death" as before, then coat with mercury. This is also suitable for restoration.

**Another Method**
Use the natural juice of white-flowered *yimu* herb, boil for seven *fu* periods, then test over fire. If not subdued, boil for another two or three days. Spread the dregs of *yimu* herb to line the bottom and cover the top, then fire gradually from slow to intense. Add three to five days of firing, and it will die. Prepare a chamber for the great elixir to nurture the Three Yellows.

**Another Method**
Pound *shuijiaojiao* to extract its juice, boil sulfur for one or two days until subdued and dead, then fire.

**The Supreme Cavern-Mystery Great Elixir Formula**
This formula was eternally concealed by the Supreme Emperor within the Jade Casket. When it appears in the world, it is because the primordial will has destined it for those of true Daoist intent. When the Emperor manifests in the mortal realm, divine beings transmit it. One must fast, bathe, purify the heart, and face the Three Palaces of the Jade Emperor to solemnly swear an oath, vowing never to recklessly divulge it. Thereafter, burn incense, focus the mind, and contemplate it.

The Four Yellows must be supported by the Four Sands.
**Explanation:** The Four Yellows are: water-cave realgar, imported sulfur, leaf orpiment, and arsenic yellow. The Four Sands are: Chenxi cinnabar, radiant sleeve cinnabar, lustrous *xipeng* sand, and needle sand.

These eight ingredients—first take needle sand, place it in a mortar, and grind finely with good rice vinegar. Then transfer to an iron pan and stir-fry until red. Next, add the remaining ingredients.

"Present them toward the frost base to unite at the corner."
**Explanation:** The "frost base" refers to *fen shuang* (powdery frost). Among the nine ingredients above, *fen shuang* is the essence of yin. The other eight are all yang. Using this one yin is called "the old yang seizing the young yin."

"Grind them three thousand times, yielding one *jin* and two *liang*."
**Explanation:** Grind three thousand times, and the two nines make eighteen, which is one *jin* and two *liang* of the medicine. Grind them together in one place.

"Master Ge’s harmonization requires skillful effort."
**Explanation:** "Master Ge" refers to purple *ge* vine. Take about five *jin*, remove the rough skin, and pound to extract the natural juice. Mix the nine ingredients above into a paste, adjusting its softness and hardness appropriately.

Sun Simiao said: "Purple *ge* vine is the essence of earth and can capture the Four Yellows and Four Sands to form the treasure."

"Within the golden hall, it is fitting to refine thrice."
**Explanation:** Coat the previous medicinal paste with gold foil, layering it threefold.

"In the Azure Water Palace, fire one furnace."
**Explanation:** "Azure Water" refers to green salt, which is the essence of water. Use a sand box—an iron box is even better. Fill the box with green salt to cover the top completely. Bind the seams with iron wire, then seal with red halloysite, white kaolin, salt flowers, and oyster shell. Choose an auspicious day to place it in the furnace.

The furnace should be three *chi* and two *cun* high and one *chi* and eight *cun* wide. Beneath it, bury a water vat, also one *chi* and eight *cun* deep, called "yearning for yin." Construct the furnace above with new bricks and clay. Inside, create a measuring seat to hold the medicinal ball, covering it with fine ash. The fire should be eight *cun* and four *fen* away from the medicine—just as the human heart is eight *cun* and four *fen* from the kidneys.

One must fast, bathe, and enter a purified chamber, contemplating the Dao and meditating on the true. Nurture the fire for three days, ensuring the fire-timing method is precise. Add charcoal four times daily, aligning with the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours. Once the fire-timing is complete, add mercury as follows.

"When the old woman’s daughter marries, she must be a match."
**Explanation:** After nurturing the fire, grind the previous medicine finely in a mortar, then add two *liang* of mercury. Grind until no specks remain. Mix again with purple *ge* vine juice and seal as before.

"Civil ends, martial concludes, and the world responds to the primordial."
**Explanation:** The sage observes the fire, making the heart’s fire like the external fire. Heaven has form: the sun, moon, and stars. Earth has form: metal, water, and fire. Refine them with civil and martial fire.

When using it, form purple *ge* vine into pea-sized pills.
**Explanation:** Open the ball to retrieve the medicine, grind it finely, and mix with purple *ge* vine juice to form pea-sized pills. Store them in a clean box, and they will emit radiance.

"One pill can transmute five *liang* of the withered."
**Explanation:** Place five *liang* of mercury in a Jian ware bowl, set it over a boiling water steamer, and add one pill of the medicine, grinding it finely and sprinkling it in. Cover the bowl and seams with damp paper, then heat the steamer with intense fire. After a moment, a sound like fine rain will be heard, followed by a long silence, then a single sound like tearing silk—the mercury will be dry. Pour it into a mold, and upon exposure to wind, it will harden into the finest soft, malleable silver.

**True Silver**
Melt five *liang* of silver into liquid, then add three pills of the medicine in three separate applications. When poured out, it will be one hundred percent pure.

For five *liang* of *shanxue* red gold or copper, remove all lead *qi*, then add two pills in two applications. When refined, it becomes *danyang* "bone-changing" pure white silver.

"If people in the world can ingest it,"
**Explanation:** For any severe illness, regardless of age, take one pill, grind it again into powder, and form it with jujube pulp into mung-bean-sized pills. Take one pill on an empty stomach with well-drawn morning water. This will prolong life, prevent aging, and ward off all diseases.

Only to transform the earth into a realm of immortals.
**Explanation:** This elixir is most secret—if lightly disclosed, it will bring calamity upon nine generations.

*Yudao Ji*, Scroll Four concludes.

*Yudao Ji*, Scroll Five

**Method for Destroying Cinnabar**
Hundred-flower serves as the base—this is honey.
Red seal makes the lid—this is Sichuan pepper.
Morning glory acts as the companion—white morning glory.
Wolfberry serves as the worthy companion.
Charcoal fire, by the *jin* measure, until the cinnabar dies—then cease.

*For ten years I studied the elixir’s tortoise,*
*What more could I seek after this?*

Use a porcelain box, coat the inside with honey, then sprinkle morning glory and wolfberry powder atop. Next, place the prepared cinnabar inside, cover it with Sichuan pepper, bind it tightly with iron wire, seal the seams with salt-clay, and subject it to fire for destruction.

**Method for Sprinkling and Steeping**
Take cinnabar, regardless of quantity, and use mallow (red mallow is also suitable). Grind it into a paste. First, spread a layer inside the box, then grind the cinnabar to remove its sharp edges. Use willow-leaf gold-star herb powder, mixed with honey to form a close-fitting wrap, and place it over the mallow paste. Cover it again with mallow paste. Seal the opening with red halloysite, then reinforce the exterior with salt-clay. Wait until dry, then apply an eight-*jin* fire for steeping. Once cooled, remove it, replace the inner lining, and seal as before. Apply another eight-*jin* fire for destruction. Repeat this process three times, and the cinnabar will be "dead."

Use three *liang* of this dead cinnabar to nurture one *liang* of raw cinnabar. Gradually increase the quantity, and with each transformation, it will grow more potent, capable of steeping mercury. For every three *liang* of the vessel’s contents, one *liang* of mercury can be steeped, with two *liang* of top-fire applied for seven days to complete the process.

**Method for Further Nurturing Raw Cinnabar**
Take one *liang* of dead cinnabar powder and mix it with one *liang* of raw cinnabar, grinding them finely together. First, spread one *liang* of dead cinnabar at the bottom of the box, then place the mixture inside, and cover it with another *liang* of dead cinnabar. Seal the seams with red halloysite, reinforce the exterior with salt-clay, and wait until dry. Apply two *liang* of top-fire and nurture for seven days. Then, subject it to a three-*jin* fire for one firing, and the raw cinnabar will also be "dead."

For steeping on the powder, first press the cinnabar to make it level and firm, then create a small depression in the center. Pour mercury into it. Seal the seams with red halloysite, reinforce with salt-clay, apply two *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for seven days. It will form a single mass within the depression—most wondrous.

**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**
For each *liang*, pack the cavity tightly with five-phase herb powder, then apply a one-*jin* fire until exhausted. Repeat this process once more, after which it can be subjected to white destruction.

**Cinnabar Subdued by Fire Reveals Treasure**
Also called *Nine Transformations Increasing the Gushing Spring Vessel*, or *Buddha Nods Approval*.

Two *liang* of silver powder
Four *liang* of mercury

Place the above ingredients together into a crucible, add half a spoonful of *Stellera chamaejasme* powder on top.

Again take two layers of round paper, moisten them with saliva, and seal the crucible’s mouth. Apply two *jin* of charcoal fire to press it until the paper slightly scorches and the fragrance of *Stellera chamaejasme* is detected. Then lift it onto cold ashes, and when it cools enough to handle, remove the paper. Pour the contents into a ceramic vessel, blow away the *Stellera chamaejasme*, and grind the cinnabar lumps thoroughly in an iron mortar. Sift through two layers of boiled silk, and weigh it—if less than six *liang*, refine it again. Even if it falls below six *liang*, it may still be paired with the mother-mercury, which is even more wondrous. Wash it three times with water, then sift again, and it will become cinnabar powder.

Next, take five *liang* or ten *liang* of granular cinnabar from Chenzhou, place it in a one-*liang*-weight raw silk pouch, and suspend it in a jar. Use fermented water or mild vinegar, along with one *liang* each of *Stellera chamaejasme* powder, *Sanguisorba officinalis* powder, and *Clematis chinensis* powder in the jar. First add three spoonfuls and boil, then replenish gradually over the next day until the medicine is exhausted, steeping it in a double boiler for three days. Remove the pouch, rinse with warm water, and dry it in a wok. For each piece of cinnabar, wrap it tightly with the previously refined cinnabar powder, adjusting the amount according to size—six *liang* of powder for two *liang* of cinnabar.

Then take five *liang* or ten *liang* of asbestos (quantity flexible), grind it to a fine powder, and prepare a clean ceramic box. First spread a layer of asbestos powder at the bottom, then arrange the cinnabar pieces like lotus seeds, cover with another layer of asbestos, add more cinnabar, and top with asbestos, pressing firmly. Seal the box’s seams with clam powder mixed with vinegar, then reinforce with paper-fiber and salt-clay. Without waiting for it to dry, place it in an ash pit and nurture it with three or four *liang* of charcoal fire for five to seven days. Remove the box and apply five to six *jin* of fire until it glows red—no harm in excess. When two-thirds of the fire’s intensity has passed, withdraw the heat, open the box when cool, and the cinnabar will have transformed into silver ingots, now weighing no more than four *liang*. The mercury has departed, leaving only the cinnabar-silver matrix, which is the elixir head.

Grind this cinnabar and refine it again into powder as before, wrapping it around cinnabar pieces, placing them in the box, and layering with asbestos. Subject it to full refinement, then remove the cinnabar—this is the first transformation. Weigh it and divide into two portions. Refine one half again into powder, wrap it around cinnabar, nurture and refine it, then weigh and divide—this is the second transformation. Repeat this process for a total of nine transformations, at which point it becomes void, ascending from the mundane to the sacred. The alum-silver is entirely exhausted, leaving only mercury.

Grind this medicine finely, mix half a *liang* with mercury, and place it in the box. Alternatively, mix one *liang* with four *liang* of mercury, omitting the asbestos. Seal it tightly and nurture for seven days, then pour more mercury. If the box becomes half-full, add more. When one or two *jin* of "dead" mercury is obtained, crush it to make an outer vessel. Place a smaller box inside this vessel, as when nurturing sulfur, and nurture for seven days to "kill" it. This method also applies to realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, arsenolite, powdered cinnabar, and mercury.

To refine mother-cinnabar powder and "kill" one *liang* of sulfur: first moisten the cinnabar powder with saliva, wrap it around the sulfur, then take equal parts of black pepper, Sichuan pepper, and *Asarum* ground into powder. Scoop two or three *qian*, mix with vinegar to form cakes, layer them with clay, and apply five *jin* of charcoal fire to refine it. Alternatively, "kill" sulfur by stir-frying ten *liang* to form blue-gold, place it in a box, and calcine. When cool, grind it to powder to make an "immortality vessel" for nurturing all substances and golden cinnabar. This medicine is highly potent, with endless transformations.

For mercury extracted through nurturing: boil *Pinellia ternata* in wine to form a paste, shape into pills the size of mung beans, and take one pill on an empty stomach while facing east, swallowing it with cold water—this is called the *Lesser Return Elixir*. It cures all illnesses. Take one pill every three to five days, up to three or five pills, and one will remain free of disease for life.

**Method for Preparing the Great Elixir**
- Alum: four *liang*
- White alum: four *liang*
- Saltpeter: four *liang*

Add a small amount of binding medicine and boil until dry. Place in a large *Jian* bowl, set on an iron stand, add the three ingredients, and cover with another *Jian* bowl. Apply five *jin* of charcoal fire to refine it. When the medicine boils and settles, do not disturb the fire. Gradually reduce the heat, and when the bowl cools, remove the medicine—it will resemble rock crystal. Weigh it without loss, grind to a fine powder, and place in a cinnabar box. Then prepare the following:

- Realgar: two *liang*
- Orpiment: two *liang*
- Arsenic: two *liang*

Grind finely, mix with *Tetrastigma* root juice to form cakes, and place them around the cinnabar box. Seal with iron wire, then coat with a mixture of four *liang* of clay and six *liang* of salt. Dry in the sun, bury in ash, and apply one *liang* of charcoal fire on top, covering with ash. Replace the fire daily and nurture for forty-nine days. Remove the medicine cakes, add two *liang* of mercury, and grind finely. Mix again with *Tetrastigma* juice to form cakes, place in the cinnabar box, seal as before, and nurture with gentle fire for another forty-nine days. Repeat the process, adding two *liang* of mercury, grinding, mixing with *Tetrastigma* juice, forming cakes, sealing in the box, and nurturing for forty-nine days.

Grind the extracted substance finely into pills. For each use, take one *zi* of the powder to transmute five *liang* of mercury into treasure.

**Refining Cinnabar (White Cinnabar)**
Take cinnabar in any quantity, place it within lotus rhizome nodes, then seal externally with clay. Refine until red and remove.

**Washing Cinnabar in the Cinnabar Vessel**
Take four *liang* of fine cinnabar, one *liang* of *Euphorbia pekinensis*, two *qian* of lead frost, one *liang* of *Iris domestica*, and one *liang* of *Aconitum carmichaelii*. Grind these into powder, then boil with three *sheng* of mild vinegar in a suspended vessel for one full day and night. Remove and apply the following body-adhering medicine.

**Body-Adhering Medicine**
Grind three *qian* each of *pengxin* and alum into powder, then mix with refined honey to form the body-adhering medicine as follows.

For each grain of cinnabar, wrap it tightly in a silver sheet. Then take eight *liang* of silver mother, hammer it into fragmented cinnabar, and place it together with the cinnabar in a vessel, layering them repeatedly. Seal the top and bottom with *shengwuzhi*, then use water-mixed red halloysite to secure the seams. Nurture with fire for three days, then remove and subject it to the *tiandi* process.

Mix *xin*, alum, saltpeter, and clamshell powder evenly, then lightly refine. Next, take ten *baimei* fruits, grind them into a paste, and wrap the cinnabar grains. Place them in a crucible and refine until reduced to ash.

Then transfer to the *tianchi* vessel, adding five *wen* of alum, a small amount of *xin*, five *baimei* fruits, and five *wen* of white kaolin. Grind these finely, then wrap the cinnabar and lightly refine until cool. Remove, wash clean with hot water, and prepare the vessel. Pour one *liang* of mercury, nurture for three days, then collect half a *liang* of sprouts, which will transmute into white furnace treasure.

**Dead Body-Adhering Medicine**
Five *wen* of *Anemarrhena asphodeloides* and five *wen* of *Fritillaria cirrhosa*. Grind these finely, first fumigate the crucible until black, then heat the crucible until red-hot. Quickly add *shengwuzhi*, saltpeter, and alum into the pot to form a molten liquid. Fan rapidly, pour out, and grind into powder to make the body-adhering medicine. Nurture with fire for seven days, then subject to the *tianchi* process before proceeding to nurture mercury, wash, and extract treasure.

**Gradual Fire Nurturing**
First day: half a *liang*.
Second day: eight *qian*.
Third day: one *liang*.

**Gradual Fire Nurturing (continued)**
Fourth day: one *liang*.
Fifth and sixth days: one and a half *liang*.
Seventh day: two *liang*. Cease.
Thereafter, pour mercury and nurture with fire.
First day: in the morning, apply one *qian* of fire; in the evening, half a *qian*.
Second day: in the morning, apply seven *qian* of fire; in the evening, half a *qian*.
Third day: in the morning, apply one *liang* of fire; in the evening, half a *qian*.
On the fourth day, when fully matured, collect half a *liang* of white sprouts. The furnace yields treasure.

**Longevity Fire-Nurturing Mercury-Washing Cinnabar Vessel**
Refine eight *liang* of cinnabar into solid lumps. Wrap the cinnabar in raw silk and secure it tightly. Suspend it in rice vinegar and boil for one *fu* period. Add *shizhu* powder (i.e., *Alpinia officinarum*) to the vinegar and boil together. Remove the cinnabar and discard the silk.

**Dead Body-Adhering Medicine**
*Stellera chamaejasme* (Sichuan) and *Asarum sieboldii* (Taiwan), in equal parts. Grind into fine powder, mix with honey to form a paste, then coat each piece of boiled cinnabar. Allow to dry slightly.

**Vessel-Entry Method**
Use a sand box. Place *shizhu* powder inside, firmly tamp half full, then arrange the cinnabar pieces (coated as above) like lotus seeds within the powder. Cover with the remaining powder, tamp firmly, seal the lid, and secure the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Proceed to nurture with fire.

**Fire-Nurturing Method**
Place the box in an ash jar, covering it with two fingers’ thickness of paper ash.
First day: morning and evening, four *liang* of fire.
Second and third days: same.
Fourth day: morning and evening, six *liang* of fire.
Fifth day: same.
Sixth day: at dawn and dusk, seven *liang* of fire.
Seventh day: at dawn, four *liang* of fire.
By evening, lift the box and heat it with three *jin* of fire until red-hot. Allow to cool, then remove the cinnabar.

**Further Fire-Nurturing Method**
Eight *qian* of silver and eight *qian* of mercury. Combine the two to form cinnabar, wash clean, then grind finely with the cinnabar from earlier. Place in a box, seal the seams with red halloysite, and set in a paper ash jar. Nurture with fire as before until complete. Apply two *liang* of fire morning and evening, avoiding excessive heat. The next day, allow to cool and remove.

**Nurturing Mother Cinnabar Method**
Wash and refine *sanqi* mother cinnabar. Divide each *liang* into three cakes, secure with raw silk, then use *Akebia quinata* and *Anemarrhena asphodeloides* in equal parts, ground to powder. Add one cup of water, suspend the cakes, and boil with gentle and strong fire until dry. Remove, then wrap with *Lilium brownii* (sifted into balls). Seal entirely with salt clay, heat with intense fire until red-hot, then quench in water. Remove the cinnabar, place in a cinnabar vessel like lotus seeds, and nurture with fire as before for seven days. Remove and refine in the furnace to yield treasure.

**Immortal’s Repeated Refinement of Metal (Geng) Method**
One *qian* of *geng* and one *liang* of mercury. Place in half a cup of true sesame oil and boil over fire. Add one *Trichosanthes kirilowii* seed and simmer until the mixture turns yellow. Add another seed, repeating until seven seeds are used. Then gradually add six to seven *qian* of *Pistacia lentiscus* resin and simmer briefly. Remove and cool, then pour the mixture onto four or five layers of paper mulberry paper. Extract the *geng*, squeezing out the oil; the refined mercury will remain within. Repeat the process until all *geng* is exhausted. Wash the cinnabar in hot water until clean and lustrous.

**Vessel-Nurturing Method**
Split a black plum pit into two halves. Fill each half with *geng* cinnabar to resemble plum kernels, then remove the cinnabar. Moisten the pit halves with honey, then dust thoroughly inside and out with refined fire-nurtured cinnabar (ground extremely fine). Place the *geng* cinnabar inside, seal the pit halves, and bind with thread. Moisten the exterior with paper mulberry juice, then coat the seams with honey. Dust the edges with *Aconitum kusnezoffii* powder, then wrap the pit with four or five mashed black plum kernels. Coat the exterior with *Aconitum carmichaelii* powder mixed with vinegar, then seal with salt clay to a thickness of one finger. Allow to dry.

**Ash Jar Method**
Fill a jar with paper ash, place the medicine ball at the center, and cover with ash. Surround with embers and nurture overnight. The next day, remove the *geng* pit; the remaining medicine will have turned to ash.

**Further Sealing Method**
Mix *Placenta hominis* root powder with honey to form a paste, shaping it into balls the size of marbles. Place the *geng* pit inside, then wrap securely with silk. Coat the exterior with a mixture of *Asarum sieboldii*, *Aconitum carmichaelii*, *Lilium brownii*, and *Croton tiglium* (in equal parts, ground to powder and mixed with honey). Seal with salt clay to a thickness of one finger, allow to dry, then place in an ash jar. Surround with fire and nurture overnight before removing.

**Furnace-Refinement Method**
Three *qian* of halite, and half a *qian* each of *chalcanthite*, *yellow alum*, *gold-wrapped earth*, *alum red* (as substitute for cinnabar), *dead cinnabar*, *Gardenia jasminoides*, and *Trichosanthes kirilowii* seeds. Grind into powder, mix with vinegar to form a paste, and encase the *geng* within. Coat the exterior with *limonite* and *hematite* powder, then place in a crucible. Fan until smoke appears to yield treasure.

**Cinnabar Body-Adhering Method**
Place one *liang* of cinnabar in a *Jian* bowl, then cover with a thick layer (one finger’s depth) of *Zanthoxylum bungeanum* powder mixed with honey. Seal with another bowl. Secure the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, then bind with iron wire. Coat the exterior of the bowl with a mixture of *Aconitum carmichaelii*, *Phellodendron amurense* bark, *Dioscorea bulbifera*, and *Dianthus superbus* spikes (in equal parts, ground to powder and mixed with vinegar) to a thickness of one finger. Use *qinglong* vessel (vinegar ash) to seal the top and bottom, leaving only the bowl’s base exposed. Place on the ground and heat with eight *jin* of fire until fully red-hot. Gradually reduce the fire, allow to cool, then remove for use.

**Cinnabar Refinement Method**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar, boil with *jichang* grass for one day and one night, retaining the grass residue, then dry by fanning. Use the following ingredients, each one and a half *liang*: *Arisaema erubescens*, *Scutellaria baicalensis*, *Angelica dahurica*, *Ampelopsis japonica*, *Dioscorea bulbifera*, *Polytrichum commune*, and *Pyrosia lingua*. Additionally, use one *liang* each of *Epimedium brevicornum* bark, *Dendrobium nobile*, and *Glycyrrhiza uralensis*. Take three *liang* of the pre-boiled grass residue, place together with the cinnabar in a sand box, seal the seams with honey-mixed red halloysite, then coat the exterior with salt clay to a thickness of one finger. Dry in the shade, then heat with five *jin* of fire until the charcoal is spent and the furnace cools.

**Cinnabar Leaching Method**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar and one *liang* of *sanqi* mother cinnabar. Wrap half in *nang* cinnabar, place in a *shizhonghuang* vessel, and nurture with three *jin* of fire for one *zha*. Remove the cinnabar, discard the adhering medicine, place in a crucible with one *liang* of mercury and one *qian* of cinnabar, cover with *Asarum sieboldii* powder, then heat to extract half a *liang* of cinnabar grains. Drive off the mercury oil, yielding one and a half *qian* of silver. Boil the cinnabar again with vinegar and alum, then refine and coagulate as before.

**Leaching Method (Alternative)**
Use one and a half *liang* of *sanqi* cinnabar to wrap one *liang* of cinnabar, place in a *shizhonghuang* vessel, and nurture with four *liang* of *maoyou* fire for seven days. Remove the mother cinnabar, then leach four *liang* of cinnabar with two *liang* of mercury, alternating between water and fire with four *liang* of *maoyou* fire for three to five days. Leach five times, then cease the fire without further leaching. Grind the leached cinnabar into a fine powder, place in a box, and use finely ground aged tea leaves as a vessel lining. Nurture for seven days with four *liang* of fire. When the time is complete, remove, wash with water, and dry by baking. For every four *liang* of powder, nurture one *liang* of cinnabar for seven days. Remove the powder, adhere *qiuyuan* mother cinnabar to the cinnabar, place in a vessel to nurture, then extract silver. Take the nurtured cinnabar and leach five times as before. Repeat this process, alternating up to seven times, and the efficacy will grow ever stronger.

**Medicinal Calcination Method**
Use *huangdan* calcined to a molten state, place in a pot, and collect the finest powder from the furnace front.

**Cinnabar Leaching Method (Variant)**
Take four *liang* of cinnabar and five *liang* of silver, cut into dice-like blocks, and mix evenly. Boil together with *duanchang* grass juice and *diwugong* juice for three days. Remove the cinnabar and silver, place in a box, and nurture for seven days with four *liang* of *maoyou* fire. Then leach with two *liang* of mercury, following the previous fire regimen. Leach again with two *liang*, and by the third leaching, remove the silver. Cease after five leachings, then boil and leach to achieve the "Longevity" transformation.

**Monolithic Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of sulfur, cut into dice-like blocks. Place in a silk pouch and suspend in a vessel. Add half a *jin* each of *tianzi* grass and *chuanyin yasheshe* grass (found by the water’s edge). Boil the two ingredients in eight *sheng* of river water, reducing to five *sheng*, then add the sulfur and boil for one day and one night. Remove, dry, and grind into powder. For each *liang* of cinnabar, cover with half a *liang* of the powder, place in a bowl, and seal with another bowl. Place three large charcoal pieces beneath the bowl and nurture for seven days. If the sulfur rises to the upper bowl, scrape it down and cover again. After seven days, remove the cinnabar from the bowl and leach with two *liang* of mercury. Cover again with sulfur, nurture for seven days, then leach with two *liang* of mercury once more, sealing the upper and lower bowls as before. After seven days, remove the cinnabar, wash clean with *Gleditsia sinensis* water, place in a box, seal the seams, and nurture with four *liang* of *maoyou* fire for seven days per leaching. When the powder matures, gradually collect the fumes.

**Monolithic Cinnabar (Verified Family Transmission by Xue Zili)**
Take ten *liang* of *shanze* mother, shape into beads. Use four *liang* of large-grained cinnabar, boil with the natural juice of chopped *Phytolacca acinosa* root for three days and nights. Remove, bathe in jujube decoction. Then boil *pengsha* with *Arisaema erubescens* and *Aconitum carmichaelii* for one day, remove, dry, and grind into a fine powder for adhesion. Drain the boiled cinnabar, dry with *peng* powder, and apply as an adherent layer. Once dry, line the bottom of the vessel with a layer of mother beads, then place the cinnabar in lotus-like arrangement within the beads. Add another layer of mother beads, then more cinnabar, and cover with mother beads. Seal, place in an ash jar, and nurture with two *liang* of *maoyou* fire for fourteen days. The extracted cinnabar will appear bluish-white; when blown in the fire, it forms beads, and the cinnabar is thus inverted. To strengthen the vessel’s potency, use more mother beads. Generally, nurture one *liang* of cinnabar with two and a half *liang* of beads—this is the first transformation. Take the inverted cinnabar from the previous nurturing, grind it, and place in a box. For every four *liang*, nurture one *liang* of pre-boiled cinnabar, adhering the medicine as before. It can be inverted in nine days. Remove and test by blowing into beads as before. Eight *liang* of beads make the best vessel—this is the second transformation. Take four or eight *liang* of second-transformation inverted cinnabar as the vessel head. Boil fresh cinnabar with *Phytolacca acinosa* for three or five days. Encase the cinnabar tightly within the grass residue, then coat the exterior with paper-fiber salt clay. Dry in the shade, surround with warm ash on the ground, and calcine with two *jin* of charcoal. When six-tenths of the charcoal is spent, cover with paper ash to retain the red fire, allowing it to cool naturally. Remove when the furnace is cold; the cinnabar will appear bluish, no longer red. Then coat with honey-mixed *peng* powder as an adherent layer, place in the second-transformation vessel, arrange in lotus formation, seal as before, and nurture for seven days with fire.

On the first, second, and third days, apply one and a half *liang* of fire. From the fourth day to the seventh, use two *liang* of fire. Once the furnace has fully cooled, remove and test the beads by blowing as before. With this most potent third-transformation cinnabar, every two and a half *qian* can transmute one *liang* of base metals into supreme treasure.

**Secret Transmission: Non-Detaching Yang-Hour Vessel for Nurturing the Sun-Moon Elixir Head**
This method employs one *jin* of aged sulfur, ground to powder. First, boil *Galla chinensis* for one *fu*-period, then strain off the residue. Next, replace with a concentrated decoction of *Scutellaria baicalensis*, *Coptis chinensis*, and *Rheum palmatum*, boiling for a full two days. Then, fumigate a box with *Galla chinensis*, first coating the interior with egg-white solution once, then fumigating thickly, and applying two more coats. Use this sulfur to nurture in vacuity for seven days; it will emerge resembling yellow gold in hue. Employing this method to further nurture yields the numinous sacred vessel. When nurturing the Two-Yellow Elixir Head, success is achieved in two seven-day cycles with wondrous efficacy.

**Subduing the Azure Dragon Treasure Vessel**
This is the method for subduing sulfur. The sagely Azure Gold Mother Cinnabar transforms through the *geng*-pathway, its marvels boundless. To nurture *fen shuang* and obtain the Azure Dragon: pound the true juice, boil sulfur for three *fu*-periods, place in a box with black paper as a divider, and seal the top with a paste cake of *chi shi zhi* and bittern. Add a layer of White Tiger, seal tightly, and bind. First nurture for seven days, then bury in an earthen pit and steam with *nie*. Upon removal, it becomes truly dead.

This *geng*-vessel transmutes cinnabar within, yielding elixir heads for medicinal use. When refined alone, it produces solitary yang; when combined with beads, it forms elixir heads. Its transformations are manifold. This vessel nurtures elixir heads without altering their innate hue. For instance, when nurturing Azure Gold, take ten *liang* of the medicine as the base. First extract two *liang* of green vitriol and two *liang* of Two-Eight Mother Cinnabar, kill them together, and consolidate into one body. Pack this firmly at the bottom of the box, then add the remaining eight *liang* of Azure Gold to cover. Seal and refine for seven days, then remove. Repeat the process: combine two *liang* of Two-Eight Mother Cinnabar with the previous eight *liang*, add two *liang* of Azure Gold, grind together, pack at the box’s base, and cover with six *liang* of Azure Gold. Nurture for another seven days, then remove, reserving six *liang* of Azure Gold treasure. At this stage, the original four *liang* of treasure are ground to powder and mixed with the six *liang* of Azure Gold to form a vessel, totaling fourteen *liang*. Transformations proceed at will; follow the method and accumulate through repeated cycles, for abundance ensures superiority. Proceed according to capacity—none shall fail to attain numinosity.

If one seeks to kill mercury, mercury must first be killed. The vessel’s uses are sixfold:
1. Nurturing cinnabar,
2. Stir-frying *jin gong* into a body,
3. Transmuting substances,
4. Separating treasures for manifestation,
5. Applying cinnabar mother as an adherent layer,
6. Sprinkling to cover the cinnabar’s surface.

This method pertains to subduing and refining Azure Gold Elixir Heads, with wondrous transformations in its latter stages.

**Another Method for Killing Sulfur**
Take ten *liang* of sulfur, boil with the natural juice of lotus root and radish for one *fu*-period. Then wrap the boiled sulfur in the residue of lotus root and radish, place in a cinnabar box, seal tightly, and secure with salt-clay pellets. Set upon the ground and steam with thirty *jin* of fire. Once the furnace cools, use it as a vessel to nurture Mother Cinnabar and the Two Yellows.

**Refining Sulfur**
Grind sulfur of any quantity finely, then pound with *Houttuynia cordata* and spinach to extract two large bowls of juice. Boil the sulfur in an iron pan for a day and night until the juice evaporates and the sulfur is subdued.

**Killing Sulfur**
Grind four *liang* of sulfur to powder. In an iron pan, boil with the decoction of *Dioscorea bulbifera* for about one day. Transfer to an amber jar: first coat the interior and lid with honey, then add *Ephedra* nodes and roots, place over fire, and burn until the smoke subsides and turns to ash; blow the ash away. Repeat with fresh roots and nodes two or three more times until the smoke ceases. Place the sulfur in the jar, seal the seams, bury in an ash pit, and nurture for three days. The sulfur will invert, becoming suitable as a vessel to nurture *geng*-cinnabar, numinous cinnabar, mother cinnabar, and the Three Yellows for transmutative medicine.

To nurture the Three Yellows, first employ the latter method: gather ample *Euphorbia lunulata* and *Marsilea quadrifolia*, pound to extract juice, and boil the Three Yellows. When the juice turns black, discard it and replace with fresh juice, repeating until the juice remains clear. Then place in a sulfur vessel to nurture; later transmutations will not darken.

**Steaming Method to Kill Sulfur for Vessels**
Pound *Cayratia japonica* and *Pteris multifida* together to extract juice, then boil sulfur. Later, wrap the sulfur in *Broussonetia* fiber, coat externally with salt-paper-fiber clay, dry, place on the ground, and steam with intense fire to kill instantly.

**Method for Boiling Sulfur to Invert Azure Gold**
Take sulfur of any quantity, decoct *Dioscorea bulbifera* in water, and drizzle the juice into a pan to stir-fry the sulfur. When the sulfur is half-dead, add mercury and stir-fry together for one *shi*-period; the Azure Gold will invert immediately. Alternatively, grind realgar, green vitriol, saltpeter, and lead frost together, invert the Azure Gold, heat a crucible until red, and collect the resulting liquid as treasure. Another method: use only raw saltpeter and Azure Gold, pack tightly into a crucible, pierce a small hole in the center, insert a *Polyporus umbellatus* stalk, steam, and collect *shao fen* and lead from the crucible’s bottom, using borax powder for the furnace—this yields great efficacy.

**Method for Killing Sulfur to Make Vessels**
Take sulfur of any quantity, pound *Rumex japonicus* root to extract juice, and boil the sulfur for one *fu*-period. Wrap the sulfur in the *Rumex* residue, seal externally with salt-clay, dry, and steam with fire to achieve true death.

**Another Method for Killing Sulfur**
Boil sulfur with winter melon juice and a small amount of glutinous rice for three days, then nurture for one seven-day cycle. Upon removal, it will resemble purple gold in color.

**Further Refinement of Sulfur**
Steam again, then nurture for two seven-day cycles until the original color is restored, and test by ceasing the fire.

**Secret Transmission: Methods for Subduing, Nurturing, and Refining Solitary Powder for Wondrous Alchemical Use**
Place within the former Azure Dragon sulfur vessel for nurturing.

Shape *fen shuang* (calomel) into small dice-like blocks weighing five *liang*. Boil with *Rheum palmatum* (rhubarb), *Galla chinensis* (Chinese gall), *Gardenia jasminoides* (cape jasmine), *Zanthoxylum bungeanum* (Sichuan pepper), *Asarum* branches, ginger juice, honey, and thick rice vinegar in river water for one *fu*-period until blackened—this is the standard. Once dry, place into a Yao vessel, then sprinkle five *qian* of raw sulfur powder and stir-fry gently until properly aged and dried as before. The original weight of five *liang* and one *qian* or more confirms success. This powder may then be applied to the essence of cinnabar ore. For every *liang* of stir-fried powder, add one *qian* of mother flakes, layer upon layer, binding them into a ball. Externally, apply two *qian* of white lime powder and one *fen* of *Alpinia oxyphylla* (black cardamom) powder as a protective coating. Then introduce to cinnabar sulfur within the former Azure Dragon vessel, nurture for two seven-day cycles, and retrieve as an alchemical treasure. If smoke appears during firing, nurture for an additional seven days—this yields wondrous transmutation.

**Secret Transmission: Mother Vessel for Nurturing Cinnabar Without Absorption**
This method is wondrous in application. For instance, take ten *liang* of true mother essence as the base and first melt it into a liquid. Then add five *liang* of pure lead to the mother solution, stirring left and right to blend evenly. Sweep into small pearl-like granules, then nurture and boil five *liang* of *ling sha* (spirit cinnabar) within this mother vessel. Arrange in a lotus pattern, and success will be achieved in seven days. Upon retrieval, each granule will be truly dead, assuming a crow-black hue. When burned over fire, they should form silver pearls as the standard. After destruction and nurturing, the alchemical treasure emerges, and the sacred embryo is separated.

A poem reads:
*On a fine night, three lone stars revolve,*
*Shattering the sweet crucible to reveal jade skin.*

This method divides the medicine to stand as the foremost under heaven—guard it closely and never reveal it to others.

First, use true iron slurry to refine saltpeter, stir-frying until dry, and set aside. For each *liang* of *ling sha*, first grind the cinnabar into powder, then add two *qian* of subdued saltpeter. Pack tightly at the crucible’s bottom, then place two *liang* of silver toad (silver) as a pressing weight on top. Expose to an open-air furnace, applying intense fire until thoroughly red-hot for a full period. Only then gently fan with a bellows. If the contents melt completely into a clear, limpid liquid, remove the crucible. The surface should be free of cicada-like pores or cavities, its color a scorched yellow—this confirms extraordinary efficacy. Among ten thousand methods, none surpass this. Guard it well.

**Subduing and Refining: First Extract Blood Paste, Then Purify to Form the Body’s Essence**
By this method, place the red dragon (mercury) into a crucible and add one *fen* of aged earth medicine, three *fen* each of edible salt, *lu gan shi* (calamine), and northern saltpeter. Combine thoroughly, seal the top tightly, and fire once in a vigorous furnace. After firing, break the crucible to retrieve the red blood. Place it into a new crucible, layering with borax powder and equal parts raw saltpeter and raw salt, filling to the brim. Once melted into a liquid, remove and gently tap to separate the embryo below, which will appear as a tender, delicate hue.

For the next step, melt pure material and add two *qian* of small elixir seeds, nurturing to produce tile sprouts. Secretly add half a *qian* of raw arsenic powder, then pour over the cinnabar. Press into the liquid, and apply coatings of black soybean decoction, fermented grain wash, and *Asparagus cochinchinensis* (heavenly winter) decoction—each in equal measure. After two applications and transformations, add a small amount of saltpeter, sweeping into powdered pearls for later use.

This method first nurtures and refines the elixir seed through prolonged firing, accumulating sufficient yang-blackness. Only then does the elixir’s transmutation succeed, termed *dan yang* (cinnabar yang), the pure yang. Later, this pure yang medicine is used to transmute pure yin—namely, the red dragon. Nowadays, those who pursue the Dao lack enlightened masters and clumsy disciples, content with fleeting, easily obtained medicines. How can such treasures possess a thousand years of qi? This follows the darkness of heaven and earth’s four seasons, employing herbs, woods, metals, and minerals to achieve success.

The seven stages are:
1. Vastness
2. Great Elder
3. Crimson Flesh
4. Staff

**Method for Refining Arsenic Powder and Calomel for Transmutation**
Take equal parts arsenic powder, calomel, *Ricinus communis* (castor bean), and *Croton tiglium* (croton), pound into a paste, and adjust the quantity as needed. Place into a water-and-fire vessel and strike—it will instantly die for any use.

**Refining Arsenic to Transmute Staffs**
Grind one *liang* each of arsenic and *Melia toosendan* (Sichuan chinaberry) powder evenly, place into a crucible, and cover with a water bowl. Boil until the water evaporates completely. Upon cooling, retrieve the arsenic, which will have sublimated onto the bowl’s bottom like a snow mountain. Use one to two *qian* of this arsenic to transmute staffs into snow-white mother essence, combining to form treasure.

**Arsenic Vessel for Transmuting Cinnabar Yang**
Take two *liang* of calomel and eight *liang* of bright arsenic. Shape each into small blocks, place into silk bags, and boil with *Rumex japonicus* root and leaves, along with fresh ginger, extracting their natural juices. If the juice is insufficient, add several bowls of water. Boil for three *fu*-periods, then sun-dry the residue. First retrieve the boiled calomel, then wrap it in a silk cotton ball. Next, grind the eight *liang* of arsenic into powder and layer it on top, also wrapping in a silk cloth ball. Protect externally with the former residue, place into a sealed vessel, and steam with three *jin* of fire until thoroughly heated. Upon cooling, grind the arsenic milk into a vessel. Then divide the calomel into four blocks, wrap tightly in silver foil, seal with lotus petals, and place into an ash pool. Fire with two *liang* of heat morning and evening, nurturing for fourteen days. Retrieve, and for every two *qian* of powder, transmute one *liang* of cinnabar yang using arsenic as the vessel.

**Steaming Calomel to Transmute Cinnabar Yang**
Grind one *liang* of calomel finely, wrap in two layers of silk cloth, and place with one hundred shelled *Croton tiglium* and *Ricinus communis* seeds each.

**Further Processing with Fresh Ginger**
Take one *jin* of fresh ginger, pound to extract the juice, and let settle. Reserve the ginger residue for separate use. Combine with the two previous medicines, suspend in a "womb" vessel, and boil the calomel until the liquid fully evaporates. Retrieve the calomel and grind finely again. Then mix the ginger residue with the calomel to form pills, wrap in *Kunlun* paper, and pound the previously boiled *Croton tiglium* and *Ricinus communis* into a paste. Apply a layer of this paste, then coat externally with an equal-part mixture of saltpeter, salt, alum, and oyster shell powder, ground into a paste. If the paste does not hold, add a small amount of sour rice vinegar and pound again into a paste. Apply another layer, briefly pass over ash fire, and dry in the sun. When shaken, the pills should rattle loosely. Place on the ground with bricks arranged beneath, and calcine with five *jin* of fire. Retrieve after the furnace cools, yielding only six *qian* of true "dead" powder. For each *qian* used, melt seven *qian* of base metal, and transmute it into pure white silver. Adding three *qian* of silver and refining together yields *hua* silver.

**Jade-Ring Arsenic Method**
Grind four *liang* of arsenic into powder, place in a crucible, and cover the mouth with two layers of hemp cloth, securing tightly with thread. Set the crucible over fire and calcine. Frequently sprinkle fresh ginger juice onto the cloth to keep it moist. Over time, the arsenic will form jade-ring-like crystals at the crucible’s mouth. Retrieve and use to transmute *he* into treasure. First, burn silkworm-eaten mulberry leaves, twigs, and stems into ash, then stir-fry the *he* until clean. Transmute with arsenic, then alloy with base metal to form treasure, suitable only for crafting vessels.

**Arsenic-Nurtured Calomel to Transmute Cinnabar Yang as a Vessel**
Grind one *jin* of arsenic finely and place in a large jar. Take *Ricinus communis* stems and leaves (excluding seeds), pound to extract two large bowls of juice, and boil the arsenic until the liquid fully evaporates. Then calcine with three *jin* of intense fire, rendering the arsenic truly "dead." Retrieve only twelve *liang* to serve as a vessel for nurturing calomel. Take four *liang* of calomel, selecting uniformly sized granules. Soak sliced turmeric in wine lees until soft, wrap each piece of calomel, then secure with fine iron wire. Place into the former arsenic vessel and nurture day and night with one *jin* of fire for three days. Upon cooling and opening, the calomel will be "dead," its color like dark indigo. For every two *qian* used, transmute one *liang* of base metal into supreme treasure.

**Dead Calomel Method**
Grind any amount of calomel finely. Mix with wood honey to form pills, place into a *kuzhang* tube, and seal the mouth with *kuzhang*. Grind *kuzhang* leaves into powder, mix with wood honey to form a paste, and coat the tube. If the leaves dry, use wood honey to adjust the paste; if fresh, simply pound into a paste and apply. Place into a "dead" saltpeter vessel and nurture until "dead." Suitable for transmuting base metal or *shimengsha*, yielding a soft, pure white, and exquisite product. When alloyed with silver in a 3:7 ratio, it becomes perfect treasure. Nurture "dead" saltpeter as follows: Place two *liang* of saltpeter into a crucible and heat until molten. Add a one-*cun* piece of *duya* soapberry and a small lump of tallow soap into the molten saltpeter, allowing the mixture to boil over them. Repeat this process five times. Once the saltpeter stabilizes, apply intense fire for one calcination, yielding truly "dead" saltpeter powder in the crucible. If the fire is insufficient, the saltpeter will solidify like a jar of jade; place in a box and nurture with fire for two days to loosen it into a vessel. Use to nurture the aforementioned calomel to immediate "death" for transmutation. When nurturing *sanshi* mother cinnabar, ensure proper alignment, though it is inferior to nurturing calomel for transmuting cinnabar yang.

**Dead Arsenic Method**
Extract juice from *mao’er yanjing* grass and *tie jiao poluomen* grass, boil arsenic with it, then wrap the arsenic in a grass residue ball. Seal externally with *guan* mud and dry. Dig a pit, place the ball inside, burying half with ash, and calcine with five *jin* of charcoal. Once the charcoal slightly diminishes, add three *jin*, then later two *jin*, for a total calcination. Retrieve after the furnace cools, yielding truly "dead" arsenic.

**Cinnabar Yang Arsenic Formula**
Grind four *liang* of arsenic and four *qian* of frankincense together evenly. Pound scallions to extract juice, mix to a suitable consistency, and place in a *jian* bowl. Burn *lamu* vine into ash, spread thickly over the arsenic, and set over fire to calcine. When white smoke rises, add more *lamu* vine ash to the smoking area until the bowl turns red. After cooling, remove the ash and retrieve the arsenic. For each *qian* of silver foil, use one *qian* of arsenic, melt in a base metal crucible, and add red charcoal fire to the molten mixture. The result will be soft and pure white, highly desirable.

**Dead Calomel**
Grind one *liang* of calomel finely, mix with fresh ginger juice to form a paste, wrap in new silk cloth into a ball, and secure tightly with thread, removing the stem. Melt four *liang* of raw honey and two *liang* of white rosin together, add the calomel ball, and stir-fry over fire until the honey and rosin dry. Place in a box, seal the seams, and nurture with slow fire overnight. If the calomel has not yet inverted, nurture for three more days. Once the calomel melts into liquid or fully inverts, burn over fire until no smoke remains—it is then "dead" and ready for transmutation.

**Dead Arsenic Method**
Burn dried *kuzhang* into ash, use any amount, and boil arsenic in the ash-infused water for a day to invert it—this is the most excellent method.

**Golden Crucible Arsenic-Nurtured Divine Elixir True Death Method**
Afterward, add alum and calcine again for best results. Grind four *liang* of arsenic and four *liang* of alum into powder. Melt four *liang* of lead into liquid, stir-fry with paper ash to form granules, wash clean with water, and dry. Mix evenly with the arsenic and alum. First, heat a crucible until red-hot, then add the mixture. Once the arsenic melts, apply intense fire for a long duration. The arsenic will be truly "dead," resembling orpiment in color.

The lead will naturally settle beneath the arsenic. Remove the arsenic, grind it finely, and use one *liang* of mercury, three *qian* of cinnabar mother, and two *qian* of raw sulfur. First, congeal the mercury mother into cinnabar sand, then add the sulfur, and stir-fry with one *qian* of dead arsenic. Add another two *qian* of arsenic, cover the crucible, and apply fire. The divine cinnabar will melt below and invert, though it will be black in color. Reheat it in a lead pool, and it will instantly become a pure white treasure. Alternatively, use the dead arsenic to form a chamber and nurture it with cinnabar mother or two *liang* of cinnabar mother foil. Fire-nurture it for seven days, then remove and refine it to instantly form a treasure.

**Dan Yang Techniques**
*Transmission of Master Shen of Guangde, from Daoist Zhang of Huating*

**First: Method for Refining Copper Strips**
Prepare fifty *wen* of copper coins—select the finest—and place them in a crucible to melt into liquid. Next, add refined alum, using a tile to stir with a fingertip until the liquid becomes clear and lustrous. First, boil two bowls of sour *dong* juice with one cup of persimmon lacquer until scalding hot, then pour into a flat tub. Place a brick at the center, ensuring the liquid does not overflow its surface. Gradually pour the copper liquid onto the brick, allowing it to flow naturally into the water—it will then be pure, soft, and refined.

**Second: Method for Refining Alum**
Grind two *liang* of fine, bright alum into powder, mix with two *qian* of sour grass powder, and blend evenly. Once the copper strips are melted into liquid, gradually add the alum mixture, stirring with a tile fingertip until the liquid becomes clear and lustrous. Pour it into the aforementioned tub onto the brick.

**Third: Method for Refining Arsenic Powder**
Grind two *liang* of arsenic with one *liang* of powdery frost, then mix with one *liang* of *zhimu* powder and grind evenly. Place in a water-and-fire vessel and process with three *jin* of water, measured precisely, until the water is exhausted. If powdery frost is unavailable, use one *liang* of mercury instead, grinding it with the arsenic medicine until no specks remain. Process with water, using four *jin* precisely, until exhausted. Each *qian* of this powder can refine one *liang* of the aforementioned copper strips, rendering them soft, white, and free of black haze. Then, add one *liang* of silver, melt together in a bright trough, and pour to cast ingots.

**Fourth: Method for Making Powdery Frost**
For every one *liang* of mercury, use approximately three *qian* each of alum and table salt, with a small amount of red *jiaojiao*. Grind together, place in a crucible, and fill it halfway. Seal the mouth with a tile cover, securing it properly. Dig a pit in the ground, tamp it firmly, and fill with water. Place the crucible upside-down in the pit, ensuring the water level is about one *cun* below the crucible. Pack soil tightly around the crucible’s exterior, then apply a cluster of fire until the ground becomes scorching hot. Once cooled, the frost will have formed and is ready for use.

**Method for Congealing and Calcining Powdery Frost: Dan Yang Bone-Transforming Technique**
- Five *liang* of mercury
- Two *liang* of arsenic
- Five *liang* of salt
- Three *liang* of calcined alum
- Three *liang* of sal nitre

First, heat and grind the calcined alum until hot, then gradually add the arsenic, grinding finely. Incorporate the mercury, salt, and sal nitre, grinding until no specks remain. While still hot, scoop the mixture into a crucible, spreading it evenly and loosely. Cover the mouth with a tile lid, then brush the lid’s underside three to five times with a thick mixture of ginger and ink, allowing it to dry. Seal the crucible’s mouth with finely ground red halloysite and nameless powder, mixed with brine and kneaded into a paste, applying a ten-finger-thick layer to the crucible’s exterior. Construct a celestial plate as in the method for ascending divine cinnabar. Begin with gentle fire, gradually increasing intensity. When the lid’s interior bubbles and boils, the medicine has ascended. Apply stronger fire for a long duration, then cease. Once cooled, collect the medicine from the lid’s underside, forming it into lumps. Wrap in silk, then boil with a mixture of sheep’s hoof root and its sprouts, extracting the pure juice. Bring to a boil once, then cool and clarify. Pour the clear liquid into a vat, suspend the wrapped medicine within, and boil for three full days. Remove, then grind the previously used alum, sal nitre, and salt on an iron grinding wheel until fine. Recalcine for two days, then cool and collect the medicine from the lid. Crush it as before, then boil again in the pure single-medicine juice for three full days. Remove, and for every one *liang* of pure bone, use two *qian* of this medicine to refine it—it will become snow-white.

**Method for Extracting Bone**
Once the copper strips are melted into liquid, add dead arsenic, white alum, calamine, and dead sal nitre, all ground evenly, and stir into the copper liquid until it boils like a mirror. Ensure no cloudiness remains; if it reappears, add more and stir again. Use a new tile to draw out the red "blood," and continue until the mirror-like surface is clear and cloud-free. For every one *liang* of red-hot copper, refine five to six *qian* for best results.

**Method for Dead Arsenic**
Take bright arsenic, first split into lumps, wrap in a silk bag, and suspend in a sand pot. Boil with a thick decoction of *jiegeng* for three full days to render it dead.

**Method for Dead Sal Nitre**
Use any amount of sal nitre. Fumigate a pot with five *liang* each of *fangfeng* and *fangji*, then add the sal nitre and melt into liquid. Toss in *duya* soapberry seeds—if the sal nitre ceases to swirl, it is dead. If it still swirls, continue heating with the medicine until the copper strips become soft as cotton.

**Method for Bone-Dissolving Paste**
Use one *liang* each of *duzhi*, dog fat, and sesame flowers. Place in a sand pot and gently heat until it forms a paste. This paste can dissolve bone into liquid to extract blood. Once thoroughly cleaned, scoop this oily medicine into an iron trough, pour the copper liquid into it, and soak two to three times—it will become soft as cotton, then ready for transmutation with the elixir head.

**Four Whites Head: Dan Yang Method**
- One part *peng*
- Two parts *liu*
- Three parts arsenic
- Four parts powdery frost

Grind into fine powder. First, place a stalk of purple grass in a bottle, then add the medicine powder to fill the bottle. Seal the mouth with a tile lid, bind with iron wire, and seal the seams with red halloysite. Dry with a mixture of sheep’s hoof root and mud. Apply three rounds of fire, allowing it to cool in the shade. Increase the fire to three *jin* for calcination. One *qian* of this medicine can refine one *liang*, turning it snow-white. First extract the blood, remove the black haze, then proceed with transmutation.

**Blood-Extracting Medicine Stick**
Take ten *liang* of the stick. First, mix with one *jin* of raw water chestnuts and pound together a thousand times, then remove and place in a crucible. Melt into liquid, then stir to form beads. Next, add a small amount of raw salt and a pinch of white kaolin powder, blending evenly with brine until moist. Place in the crucible and melt freely until reddened by the fire. Remove, wash clean, then return to the crucible to boil into liquid. A red oil will form on the surface, with clear water beneath. Skim off the oil scum, pour into a brush-water solution to form beads, then use the black-removing medicine to stir and eliminate the black residue.

**Eastern Mountain Mugwort, Dao-Subduing Mugwort, Goldthread Vine Juice.**

**Four Whites Head for Nurturing White Sand**
Arsenic, powdery frost, *peng*, *liu*, and cinnabar. To nurture one *liang* of powdered silver, use this to transmute twenty-four *liang* as the treasure.

**Cinnabar Method**
Equal parts of *daji*, *langhua*, and *yuanzhi*. Take one *liang* of cinnabar—select solid pieces with well-formed walls. Grind the herbs into coarse powder and stir-fry with the cinnabar. First, boil three *liang* of the herbs and cook for one full day and night. Then, stir-fry the cinnabar with the same herbs until scorched, blow off the ash, and stir-fry again. Repeat three times, then remove. Grind the cinnabar finely, mix with honey into a single mass, wrap in silk, press flat, and place in a box. Line the bottom with the Four Whites Head nurturing medicine, place the cinnabar in the center, and cover with more nurturing medicine. Seal the box tightly, place in an ash jar, and nurture with two *liang* of fire at the top, keeping the sides slightly distant. Nurture for one full day and night, then remove and grind finely. Add five *qian* of silver mother, and nurture again for one full day and night following the previous method. Remove and grind finely. Next, melt fine flower silver in a crucible, pour into a mold to form a solid block, then roll in honey and place in the box atop the silver. Sprinkle the previously nurtured cinnabar over it, seal tightly, and return to the ash jar. Nurture with three *liang* of fire at the top, keeping the sides slightly kindled, for one full day and night. Remove, peel off the treasure, mix with one *liang* of powdery frost, and place in an arsenic nurturing jar within the ash jar. Nurture with fire for five to seven days, using one day as the standard. Remove and proceed with transmutation.

**Boiling Medicine for Nurturing the Elixir Head**
*Heche*, Sichuan pepper, ginger juice, *diding*, lotus root juice.

**Method for Refining Arsenic Powder into Cinnabar-Yang**

Combine equal parts of arsenic powder and frost powder, place in a water-fire crucible, and refine by sublimation. Then add to the boiled medicine.

Take seven *jin* of undamaged soap beans, burn to ash—avoid over-burning, retain their nature. Steep in five *sheng* of fine vinegar, boil and strain five times. Then crush the soap beans, soak in five *sheng* of fine vinegar for two hours, knead and filter the dregs, and combine with the previous ash liquid. Suspend and boil for three days. Return to the crucible for sublimation, gradually increasing the heat until midnight. Remove the crucible when cool. Suspend again using *wutong* wood ash as the womb, and refine once more. After sublimation, grind finely and refine again. The residue at the bottom or the ring formation serves as verification. Take one *qian* to transmute one *liang* of snow-white silver.

**Method for Stir-Frying Frost Powder**

Use equal parts of *fozuo* grass, poppy grass, *gujing*, *shangu*, *diyu*, *husuntou* grass, and *guiyu*. Grind into powder, mix evenly with mulberry ash liquid and lotus root juice, set aside half, and boil the remaining small portion for one full day and night. Remove and wrap in silver foil.

Then combine the remaining medicine with lotus root juice and mulberry ash liquid, wrap the silver foil-covered frost powder within, and bind tightly with silk cloth. For external sealing medicine: grind *daji*, *shanglu*, *weilingxian*, rhubarb, and *huanglian* into powder, mix with lotus root and mulberry ash liquid to form cakes, and wrap around the bundle. Fry until charred, replace several times, then place in a crucible. Layer with boiled herbal medicine, cover with *huangdan*, litharge powder, and refined saltpeter, ground finely. Mix with lotus root juice, mulberry ash liquid, and rhubarb to form cakes, seal tightly, and calcine into a solid mass. Crush for use.

**Method for Subliming Arsenic, Cinnabar, Frost Powder, and Sal Ammoniac for Transmutation**

Wrap one *liang* of frost powder, half a *qian* of arsenic, half a *liang* of cinnabar, and two *qian* of sal ammoniac tightly in silk cloth. Boil in scallion and ginger juice diluted with water for one night. Remove, dry, and place in the crucible.

Crucible medicine: *difuzi*, pinellia, fritillaria, scutellaria, *caowu*, *juanwu*, and *huixian*. Grind into powder, mix with the previous medicine, place in the crucible, and cover with additional medicine. Seal the seams and dry. Refine in the water-fire crucible for transmutation into snow-white silver.

**Master Ge’s Method for Seeing the Treasure Arsenic**

Use Sichuan pepper, *cangmu*, *chuanlang*, *duchuan*, *lianzi*, *shiwei*, and purple-backed *huer*. Grind ten *liang* of arsenic into powder, mix evenly, and place in a clay pot. Refine in a water crucible with one cup of water until boiling vigorously. When the fire subsides, remove the next day—it will resemble silver, suitable for making crucibles and ready for transmutation.

Grind the previous ten *liang* of arsenic into fine powder, wrap with four *liang* of frost powder in silver foil, place in a sealed container, and nurture with fire for three days. Apply three *liang* of fire at dawn and dusk each day. After the full period, remove—it is now ready for transmutation.

Melt one *liang* of *rongzhangzi*. First use high-quality arsenic the size of a soybean to open the surface, then apply one *qian* of dead powder for wondrous effect. If not using dead powder for transmutation, nurture cinnabar in a dead powder crucible, with cinnabar placed in a western-facing container against the body. Nurture for seven days—it will be ready for transmutation. If not using a dead arsenic crucible for transmutation, nurture realgar in a dead arsenic crucible, also with a western-facing container against the body. Nurture for seven days—it will transmute metal. Alternatively, nurture mother cinnabar with dead powder for fourteen days to form treasure. If nurturing mother cinnabar with dead arsenic, seven days suffice to form treasure.

**Method for Refining Arsenic Powder to Transmute Bone into Bone-Head Crucible for Nurturing Divine Cinnabar**

Use six *liang* of frost powder and four *liang* of arsenic. Grind equal parts of *difuzi*, *cheqianzi*, Chinese gall, *baifuzi*, leek seeds, Sichuan *lianzi*, pine nuts, *hezi*, and *chushizi* into coarse powder. Place the arsenic powder in an iron pan, boil in flowing water for one day, then stir-fry until dry. Refine in a water crucible with fifteen *jin* of charcoal for one day. Remove when the furnace cools, repeat the process the next day, and refine again for one day. Use one *qian* to transmute one *liang* of bone.

Crush the bone to make a mother crucible. For each *jin* of bone, nurture four *liang* of divine cinnabar. Apply two *liang* of fire at the top, nurture for three days, then increase to four *liang* of fire for another four days. Remove when the furnace cools, discard the mother, and place the divine cinnabar in a crucible. Refine with saltpeter and other medicines. Combine the divine cinnabar with the mother in a four-six or three-seven ratio for optimal effect.

**Arsenic Crucible for Nurturing Calcined Frost Powder and White Divine Cinnabar (Dogwood Head)**

**Making the Crucible**

Grind one *jin* of arsenic finely, mix with finely pounded *xuancao*, and boil in water for three days. Remove, dry, and refine in a water-fire crucible for one day. Nurture with two *liang* of fire at dawn and dusk for seven days. Increase the fire and nurture for another seven days until no smoke remains. Then add two *liang* of raw arsenic, wait seven days, add another two *liang*, and repeat until four *liang* of raw arsenic are added—the crucible is now potent and can nurture white divine cinnabar. When first adding arsenic, place mercury and *he* in the center for potency, enabling the nurturing of frost powder.

**Method for Adding Mercury and *He* to the Arsenic Crucible**

Melt *he* into liquid, add a small amount of white rosin, stir until clear, then add mercury. For every five *liang* of arsenic, use three *liang* of *he* and nine *qian* of mercury—this ratio is standard. Distribute evenly into the arsenic crucible.

**Method for White Divine Cinnabar (Dogwood Head)**

Grind twenty *liang* each of mercury and arsenic into powder until no mercury stars remain. Gradually add five *liang* of western-facing container and five *liang* of alum, grind finely with the previous medicine, and refine in a water-fire crucible to form dogwood heads. Remove after one day, shape into chess-piece blocks, then boil with *mubie*, *duanchangju*, *matixiang*, and Sichuan pepper in three large bowls of water. Suspend the dogwood heads and boil for one day, then place in the arsenic crucible. Nurture with fire for fourteen days, then invert and remove for crucible use.

**Method for Calcining Lead Frost and Nurturing in the Arsenic Crucible**

Boil lead frost with fish-pond-grass juice until refined, then decoct with licorice nodes. Mix *sanleng*, *shihu*, *diyu*, and *wujia pi* into a powder to form a body-wrap, and nurture within the arsenic crucible before placing the dogwood-head crucible.

Once the dogwood heads are refined and boiled, use two *liang* of the previous arsenic crucible powder to cover both top and bottom. Then, soak the powder with natural juices of iron-pagoda grass and fresh ginger until moist, and nurture with water for seven days, applying two *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours.

Remove, grind finely, and return to the crucible. Soak again with true juices of fragrant celery and fresh ginger, then nurture for another seven days with half the fire. Grind finely to form a crucible, then proceed to nurture the lead frost.

**Fire Regimen for Nurturing Lead Frost**
- Day 1–4: one *liang* each
- Day 5–6: one and a half *liang* each
- Day 7: two *liang*

**Method for Subduing Fire in Sulfur and Realgar**
Grind one *liang* each of sulfur and realgar with one *fen* of crane-crown frost, place in a box, and cover with another *fen* of frost. Seal tightly, then bury in an earthen cauldron. Apply five *jin* of external fire, then increase by half a *cheng* to subdue the fire. This is the Elixir of Pure Yang and Two Qi.

**Method for Refining Sulfur**
Take one *liang* of sulfur, one *liang* of ephedra, and two *liang* of *daji*. Burn to ash, layering top and bottom, seal tightly, and calcine in a well-mouth furnace until red. Pour into water, collect the floating sulfur, remelt, and refine as before for use.

**Method for Refining the Three-Yellow Crucible**
Grind one *liang* each of female sulfur into fine powder. Use a small oil-stained *meng* box, fill halfway with female sulfur, then sprinkle summer-withered grass powder lightly over the medicine. Mix another half *liang* of summer-withered grass with water to form a mud-like seal for the box’s mouth. Further seal with four *liang* of thoroughly mashed field-cross grass. Then, coat with salt-clay to a thickness of one *cun*, dry in the sun, and ensure no cracks form.

Place in a clean room on the ground, surround the box with one bowl of mulberry-wood ash sprayed with vinegar to moisten, then tightly pack the box with vinegar-soaked ash to conceal it. Arrange half a *cheng* of charcoal evenly, ignite from the top, and calcine. Once the fire has fully cooled, break the box, collect the medicine, and grind finely. Add another *liang* of male sulfur, grind finely, place in the box, seal as before, dry, and calcine. Wait for the fire to cool, then grind again.

Add one *liang* each of raw three yellows, grind together, and refine with fire as before. Then, add three *liang* of three yellows, grind, place in a large box, seal with grass powder, and calcine until cool. Add three *liang* of mercury and one portion of "yellow essence," grind until no mercury stars remain, then place in the box, seal with salt-clay, and bury in an ash pit (the nurturing fire ash pit).

Apply four *liang* of mature fire top and bottom, nurture for seven days, replenishing morning and evening with a constant four *liang* of fire. After seven days, if the yellow has formed into powder, shape into a golden-mother crucible.

Then, take one *liang* of refined gold, hammer into foil, and place with five *liang* of mercury in a jar. Add five *qian* of Sichuan pepper powder, seal the mouth with fresh ginger, and warm with ash fire, shaking frequently. Continuously add Sichuan pepper powder until it forms sand-like granules. Remove when tightly clustered like lotus seeds, and combine with true gold.

Use another sand box: first layer four *liang* of golden-crucible powder, then place a layer of sand granules, followed by another four *liang* of powder. Cover with the remaining powder, seal with salt-clay, dry, and place in the ash pit. Initially apply two *liang* of mature fire for one *fu* period, then increase to three *liang* for another *fu* period. Apply four *liang* of fire, then nurture for five more days. Finally, use three *jin* of mature fire to calcine until fully red, then remove for crucible use.

**Method for Calcining Sulfur**
Place any quantity of sulfur in a crucible and calcine with gentle fire. When ghostly flames arise, drip birch-leaf juice until the flames subside. Then, plug the crucible mouth with birch-leaf residue, calcine until red, and remove for crucible use. Nurture cinnabar, male and female sulfur, and mother sand in the crucible.

**Method for Calcining Realgar**
Take one *liang* of realgar, shape into blocks, and boil in wintergreen juice for one *fu* period. Then, use a fumigation crucible. Prepare equal parts of grass, mugwort, *juanwu*, and *diyu* into powder, fumigate the crucible until thick smoke fills it, then place the realgar inside. Cover with the powder, and calcine with slow fire until the crucible turns red. Remove when cool, break the crucible to retrieve the realgar, and simmer in goose fat for two hours. For every *liang* of silver, use one *qian* of yellow, applied in three doses to form red *geng*.

**Method for Subduing Sulfur**
Grind one *liang* of sulfur with two *liang* of mugwort ash, place in a crucible, and tightly cover with cold-water stone powder. Apply three *jin* of fire. When cool, place on paper, rinse with a bowl of water, and filter the clear liquid. Repeat with two *liang* of mugwort ash, rinse again, dry, and grind for transmutation use.

**Method for Subduing Realgar**
Take any quantity of realgar, grind with *wasong* and oyster shell into a thick paste, and coat the exterior of a crucible. Seal the mouth tightly, leaving three finger-widths of height and one finger-width of thickness. Place the realgar powder inside, then apply five *jin* of fire to the opening and calcine, monitoring closely. When the smoke dissipates and the substance shines like a mirror, remove and refine.

**Method for Subduing Sulfur**
For each *liang* of sulfur, wrap it in ink-dipped vinegar paper, cover the top with *wufang* grass, and seal the seams with saltpeter and clam powder. Then, mix bamboo-leaf ash with salt clay to reinforce the exterior. Apply half a *jin* of fire twice for tempering, then increase to five *jin* of fire and calcine until fully transformed.

**Four Spirit Receptacle**
Take one *jin* of sulfur in large chunks, each the size of a fist. Use three *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, extracting its natural juice. Place the sulfur chunks in an iron pot, cover them with the rehmannia residue, and press firmly into the pot’s base. Then, mix three *sheng* of true mulberry wood ash with the rehmannia juice and spread it over the residue. If ghostly flames appear around the edges, sprinkle dry mulberry wood ash on top to prevent ignition.

Heat the pot’s base with wood fire until the sulfur glows red. Remove the residue and ash from the sulfur’s surface, grind them together finely, and set aside. Take the sulfur from the pot’s base, combine the two ash mixtures, and rinse with boiling water until the liquid runs clear. If the rinsing liquid remains turbid, add more hot water and repeat until it clarifies.

Place the sulfur back into the pot with the clarified rinsing liquid and boil until dry. Transfer the sulfur into a copper-melting crucible, applying intense fire as in silver-smelting. When the sulfur turns to golden liquid, pour it into a mold to form "golden larvae," retaining its innate color and density.

After smelting, take one *liang* of this sulfur and combine it with one *liang* each of orpiment and realgar. Place the orpiment and realgar at the bottom of a sand crucible, cover with the smelted sulfur, and apply a cluster of fire until the crucible glows red. Grind the orpiment and realgar together finely, add one *liang* of dead sal ammoniac, and grind again into powder. Place the mixture into a copper-melting crucible, cover with a lid, and heat in a water-fire vessel until five cups of water evaporate. Separate the layers: sal ammoniac on top, sulfur in the middle, and orpiment-realgar at the bottom.

Take the three substances—sulfur, orpiment, and realgar—and refine one *liang* of cinnabar. Layer the cinnabar at the bottom and top, then apply fire morning and evening for seven days. Repeat with four *liang* of fire for another seven days. The resulting product forms the *Four Spirit Receptacle*, used to nurture *geng* silver mother-sand or for cyclic transformation methods. For sand, avoid forming pellets; instead, use long strips inserted into the receptacle for calcination. If the sal ammoniac turns uniformly white and separates on the surface, it may be removed. Do not grind sal ammoniac with the three yellows.

If ash frost appears on the receptacle’s surface, it must be removed by separating the layers until the frost is fully cleared.

**Dead Sal Ammoniac**
Take any quantity of sal ammoniac, boil it with two bowls of natural juice from *ruolian* (also called *mucai*), wrap it in silk, and suspend it to boil until the juice evaporates. Remove the silk, place the sal ammoniac in a *jian* bowl, and calcine it with the vegetable residue covering both top and bottom until the residue turns charred black. The sal ammoniac, now separated from its fumes, is ready for use in the three-yellows receptacle.

**Method for Calcinating Sulfur**
Take four *liang* of sulfur, grind it into fine grains, and boil it for one *fu* period with five or six bowls of juice from *tianzi* grass and spinach in equal parts, suspended in a silk pouch. Remove the sulfur, place it in a crucible, and cover the top and bottom with the vegetable residue. Temper with fire for three days until the residue dries inside. Then, apply three *jin* of fire for calcination. Remove the sulfur, sprinkle plum-kernel sand moistened with vinegar, and grind it into powder. Place the sulfur back into the crucible, secure it with thread, and coat the exterior with a honey-mixed paste of fivefold powder and *tiannanxing* in equal parts. Seal with *liuyi* clay, let dry, and heat in gentle and strong fire for one to two hours. Remove and proceed as follows:

First, heat a pot in the furnace until half-red. Add the sand, then sprinkle one *qian* of sulfur powder over it. When the substance transforms, add another *qian*, and repeat until all is added. Vigorously fan the fire, then add a small amount of borax. When the substance appears lustrous and pure, pour it out as treasure.

**Method for Boiling Dead Sulfur**
Boil sulfur for one day in equal parts of *cheqian* grass juice, mugwort juice, and banana oil. If it boils over, add paper-ash juice dropwise. One *qian* of this sulfur can transmute silver into *geng*.

**Method for Subduing the Three Yellows**
Grind leaf orpiment, water-ground realgar, and imported sulfur into an extremely fine powder. Mix with bitter wine to form a paste, wrap in *Kunlun* paper, and bind with a paste made from one and a half *liang* each of *fangfeng* and *huangqin*, along with *yangti* (not sheep’s hoof but *luti* vegetable). Next, extract juice from *qianzhen* grass, mix with *quezi* root and salt, and use yellow clay to seal the mixture. If unavailable, use leek juice or earthworm castings instead. Seal with a half-inch-thick layer of clay and let dry. Place the receptacle in a shallow pit, surround it with ash, and apply three *jin* of fire to calcine two-thirds. Then, apply fire again to complete the transformation. Cover with cold ash until cool, and it is ready for use.

*Poem:*
The grasses subdue the three yellows’ might,
Revealing the Dao’s profound alchemy.
The immortals’ secret arts take flight,
Uniting the heart with the Way’s decree.

**Method for Calcinating Sulfur**
Grind one *liang* of arsenic into powder, place it in a pot, and press it down with castor beans. Cover the pot’s mouth with silk, brush ginger juice onto the silk until it is fully absorbed, then invert the pot into cold ash and seal. Remove the arsenic, and use one *qian* per *liang* of substance for transmutation.

**Five Metals Powder Method**
Take one part each of arsenic, fivefold borax powder, and mercury, along with half a *liang* of refined cinnabar. Grind each ingredient in a mortar until no specks remain, then spread the mixture thickly between two layers of paper.

**Honey-Pepper and Poria with Five-Ingredient Resin Method**
Take honey-pepper, poria, and five-ingredient resin, along with grass-decision (cassia tora). Use one or two of these ingredients, wrap them in a cloth pouch, then tightly bind with hemp thread. Coat the exterior with fine ash mixed with vinegar, shaping it delicately. Use eight *jin* of hard charcoal, applying intense top-fire to calcine thoroughly.

*Secret Formula:*
Divide the medicine into seven parts, half-cooked, then separate. Use an iron shovel to cluster the fire, turning it repeatedly. Burn red-hot fire beneath until reduced to ash. Cover with a tile basin, encircle with clay strips, and leave overnight. Seal the base’s seams with clay strips for another night.

For three *liang* of bone and one *liang* of flesh: first boil the bones into broth, add half a *qian* of medicinal powder, stir rapidly, then pour out. Re-calcine, adding another half *qian* of powder, repeating four times. Ensure the base fire is well-arranged, with two *qian* of powder added continuously.

When using the trough: after firing, drip water—if it beads without scattering, pour into the trough to form a honeycomb texture. Mix two *qian* of nitre with one *qian* of arsenic; once complete, remove the greenish residue. For half a *qian* of calcined cinnabar and one *qian* of nitre, add one *fen* of fragrant scales, grind into powder, and coat evenly. Fire until no trace remains.

Grind the three ingredients into powder, mix with milk to form a thin paste, and apply with a goose feather. Then use fire to press it in.

**Powder Refinement Method**
Grind one *liang* of powder with two *qian* of silver filings, mixing evenly, then wrap in silk. Next, take one *liang* each of arisaema, black sesame, sanguisorba, pig-tooth soapnut, *qiannianrun* (evergreen vine), and aconite, grinding them into fine powder and dividing into two portions. Mix one half with honey for wrapping, and the other with camphor willow root and garlic juice, pounding evenly and wrapping in a layer to compact. Seal with salt-clay, calcine with three *jin* of top-fire until red-hot, then cool and remove.

For another *liang* of powder, divide into ten pieces, wrap in silk, discarding excess. Suspend in a crucible, boil in ginger juice, honey, and rice vinegar overnight. Then place in a kiln, stir-frying with *madouling* (birthwort fruit) nine times.

**Three-Preservation Method**
Mix one part arsenic, half a part powder, and one *liang* of three-seven cinnabar, grinding evenly. Wrap in boiled silk, suspend in a crucible, and boil in one bowl each of camphor willow and onion juice with four *liang* of honey until dry. Then take one *liang* each of eucommia bark and tangerine peel, grind into powder, and pack tightly in a crucible, sealing top and bottom. Cover with one *liang* of raw alum powder, sprinkle with water, then fill with lime. Seal the mouth with a tile, bind with iron wire in a cross, and reinforce with salt-clay. Once dry, calcine with three *jin* of top-fire until red-hot. Remove, cut into chunks, using one *qian* per *liang* of substance.

**Calcinated Lead Frost Method**
Grind one *liang* of powder (basin-mouth grade) into fine powder. Mix with paper mulberry juice to form a lump, wrap tightly in two layers of coarse silk, binding with thread and trimming the ends. Prepare the following medicine:

- Gardenia
- Chinese gall
- Sliced turmeric

Take equal parts of these three ingredients, half a *liang* each, grinding into fine powder. Mix with half a cup of rice vinegar, half a cup of ginger juice, and honey. Place in a *jian* bowl, set over two *jin* of mature fire. When the medicinal liquid boils, add the three ingredients, stirring into a thick paste. Place the powder ball in the center of the medicinal liquid, using a well-fire method. Once the medicine ignites, remove the well-fire and apply intense fire until the smoke dissipates. The center of the bowl should form a pellet the size of a bullet. Remove the bowl, cover with half-dry, half-wet ash. Once cooled, remove, using one *qian* per *liang* of substance, divided into three applications.

**Calcinated Arsenic Method**
Grind one *liang* of arsenic finely in a basin. Take equal parts of sophora root, arisaema, and acanthopanax bark, grinding into coarse powder. Use a six-*liang* crucible, place the medicine inside to fumigate the crucible, then cover with damp paper. When the crucible turns black, remove the medicinal ash and add the arsenic, covering it with the previous medicinal powder. If arsenic fumes appear, add more powder, and remove after half a day. Once cooled, break the crucible, taking out the arsenic. Use one *qian* per *liang* of substance, divided into three applications, adding arsenic first, then powder.

**Calcinated Arsenic Powder Method**
Grind together one *liang* of arsenic, half a *liang* of powder, two *qian* of calcined substance, half a *liang* of *xipeng* (borax), two *qian* of cinnabar, and two *qian* of mercury. Wrap in silk to form a ball, place in a jar, and fill with banana ash juice. Bury the medicine in the center, nurturing with fire for fourteen days. Seal externally with *didancao* (blister beetle), then reinforce entirely with spirit-clay. Place in a furnace, nurturing with fire: first seven days, use four *liang* of *mao-you* fire; second seven days, use five *liang* of *mao-you* fire; fifth and sixth days, six *liang*; seventh day, half a *jin*. Once complete, remove and place on the ground for seven days before opening the jar to retrieve the medicine. Use one *qian* per *liang* for transmutation.

**Calcinated Arsenic Powder Method (Alternative)**
Grind two *liang* of arsenic and one *liang* of powder into fine powder, then add three *qian* of psoralea powder, mixing evenly. Wrap in silk to form a ball, boil in natural spinach juice until thoroughly permeated. Then pack the vegetable residue and ball tightly into a bottle, firing until the residue chars. Remove. Use one and a half *qian* per *liang* of substance, divided into three applications.

**Another Method**
Grind four *liang* of arsenic into powder. Divide three *liang* of lead frost into three packets. Take an unspecified quantity of *wufangcao* (five-direction herb), pound thoroughly, and extract the natural juice to mix with the arsenic into balls. Then use the *wufangcao* residue to form cakes, layering the arsenic in a sand jar. Fill the jar’s top with finely pounded fresh ginger.

Seal the mouth and seams with red halloysite clay, then coat the entire vessel externally with salt-clay to a thickness of approximately half an inch. Once dry, place it in an ash pit, apply four *liang* of fire, and nurture for one full day and night. The following day, add four *jin* of fire, calcining until the fuel is fully consumed. After a day, open and inspect—the arsenic will have been rendered inert, forming a single mass. Grind to a fine powder, add one *liang* of lead frost, and grind evenly. Also use *wufangcao* (five-direction herb), following the previous method to mix, seal, and dry. Then apply three *jin* of fire to calcine until red. After a day, open and inspect, then add another *liang* of lead frost, repeating the method as before. After three such cycles—along with the single calcination of arsenic—four firings in total are recorded. The medicine will resemble amber in color. Grind finely into powder; for each *liang* of substance, use one *qian* of amber arsenic, melt together, and pour out. Once it achieves the superior hue, it may be fashioned into vessels. Boil in plum juice, and it will never develop a cloudy tint nor exhibit harshness or volatility.

**Another Method**
One *liang* of arsenic yellow, one *liang* of subdued-fire *pao*, half a *liang* of lead frost, and half a *liang* of arsenic.
Grind the above ingredients together, place in a sand jar, seal as before, and apply gentle and strong fire, nurturing for seven days. Conclude with a strong fire of one *chi* in height. Cool and grind; divide each *liang* into two portions, each portion sufficient to refine one *jin* of high-quality material.

**Subduing Fire for *Pao* Sand**
For each *liang* of *pao*, use one *liang* of cuttlefish bone.
Grind the two ingredients together, first heat a pot until red-hot, then immediately add the medicine and pour out once melted.

**Method for Subduing Lead Frost**
One *liang* of lead powder.
Mix with *jindeng* flower juice to form balls, wrap in ink-dyed paper, place in a jar, and cover with one *liang* of *tiannanxing* (arisaema). Further cover with five layers of lotus leaves, seal as before, apply three *jin* of fire, and calcine to completion.

**Calcining Arsenic**
Use an unspecified quantity of arsenic.
Cover with gypsum powder, place in a crucible, and seal the top with a bowl. The arsenic will sublimate onto the bowl; collect it. Then take the arsenic, pound *bima* (castor bean) meat into a paste, wrap the arsenic inside, further wrap in *kunlun* paper, and seal externally with mud. Apply three *jin* of fire to calcine until cool.

**Five Spirits Seizing the Seven Po**
Grind one *liang* of lead powder finely, place in a *jian* bowl, and steep repeatedly in boiling water to remove alum taste, five or six times, until tasteless. Divide into two balls using white silk, tying tightly. Extract juice from fresh ginger and radish to make one cup, add one *liang* of honey, place the lead powder balls inside, and suspend to boil until dry. Stir-fry in an iron pan until the silk turns charred black. Do not remove the silk fragments. Grind *langdu* (wolfsbane) and *kushen* (flavescent sophora) in equal parts into powder, mix with four walnut meats, grind finely, add a small amount of honey, and form into cakes to encase the lead powder balls. Further wrap with pounded *didancao* (blister beetle herb), place in a jar, and cover the top and bottom with fine powder of mulberry leaves and eggplant leaves. Seal the seams, apply two *liang* of fire morning and evening, and nurture for three days. Then place in a furnace, apply three *jin* of fire to calcine until red-hot, cool, and remove. Crush into powder, add two and a half *liang* of mercury, seal as before, nurture for seven days, then calcine red-hot again. Cool, remove, pound into powder in a mortar, add another two and a half *liang* of mercury, seal as before, nurture with fire for three days, then place in the furnace with three *jin* of fire to calcine red-hot. Remove and break into chunks. Take seven *liang* of *mozhangzi* (grinding rod), melt in furnace smoke, and pour the previous medicine into it to form superior silver.

**Hundred-and-One Powder**
Grind one *liang* of lead powder finely, wrap in silk to form four balls, and boil in three *liang* of honey using a double boiler until the honey is exhausted. Wash the lead powder balls clean, then boil in a strong *zaojiao* (Chinese honey locust) decoction for one full day and night. Remove, then boil in one cup of *jichangcao* (chicken intestine herb) juice with half a *liang* of borax until adhering closely. Wrap externally with a piece of black gauze, tie securely, place in an iron pan, and stir-fry for three two-hour periods. Remove and grind finely. Add one *liang* of *sanqi* mother cinnabar, grind together, and wrap again. Then use equal parts of *baiyaojian* (myrobalan), lead white frost, and *madouling* (birthwort fruit) as *jin* powder. Stir-fry the lead powder balls for two two-hour periods, remove, and bury in the ground overnight. For each *qian* of powder, refine one *liang* of substance, dividing into three applications. Wrap the powder in silver foil when adding; use in proportions of three, seven, four, or six—excellent.

**Method for Calcining Arsenic Powder**
One *liang* of arsenic, half a *liang* of lead powder, three *qian* of borax, and one *qian* of *liu* (sulphur).
Grind the four ingredients into powder and wrap in *kunlun* paper to form a ball. Then take one *liang* each of *caowu* (wild aconite) and *nanxing* (arisaema), grind into powder, and mix with *wuyecao* (five-leaf herb)—if unavailable, substitute spinach—pounded into a paste to form a dough. Encase the previous medicine ball as a lining. Seal externally with salt-clay to a thickness of approximately one inch, and dry in silence. Apply six *jin* of fire, calcining in a spiral from the top; when smoke appears, withdraw the fire. Repeat this process twice, then calcine in a damp ash bed until cool. Grind finely to the size of millet grains. For each seven *qian* of substance, use three *qian* of mother material and one and a half *qian* of medicine, adding in three applications. Refine the substance, then boil in salt, alum, and plum juice for half a day.

**Four Spirits Alchemical Refinement**
One *liang* of *sanqi* mother cinnabar, one and a half *liang* of lead powder, one *liang* of arsenic, one *qian* of borax, one *qian* of *liu* (sulphur), *huayin xixin* (asarum from Huayin), *juanxiang* (costus root), *caowu* (wild aconite), and *bai’ai* (mugwort).
Grind the four herbal ingredients in equal parts into fine powder. Use a jar, placing half a *liang* of medicine on the top and bottom, with the previous medicine in the center. Apply half a *jin* of fire and three cups of water as the measure. For the second firing, use two *jin* of fire and five cups of water. For the third firing, use five cups of water and five *jin* of fire. Refine one *liang* and one *qian* of cinnabar per application.

**Golden Tripod Powder**

Lead powder, one *liang*, ground into fine powder and bound in silk.

Five倍子 (*wu bei zi*), *he che* (human placenta), and various tooth-ridge horns.
Place in a large bowl of water and boil until the powder is dry.

**Method for Forging the Golden Tripod Cinnabar**
Three *liang* of arsenic, four *liang* of lead.
Melt the lead in a crucible until liquefied, then add three or four drops of water to clarify the liquid. Add cinnabar.
Cut the cinnabar into dice-sized pieces and gradually introduce them into the crucible. Once complete, lift and open it in a cool place—the crucible will naturally separate, with lead settling at the bottom and golden cinnabar rising to the surface.
Next, pulverize the cinnabar finely, then grind the pre-boiled powder. Place one *qian* of silver foil in a silver dish, cut into pieces, with half inside and half layered above and below, sandwiching the powder in the center.
Add a small amount of mercury, seal it, then cover with nine *qian* of *Golden Tripod Cinnabar*. Place in a *jian* bowl, seal the bowl, and cover tightly with a lamp dish.
Fill the top with ash, shaping it into a cone. Surround with fire, using five *jin* for one firing, reducing by two-thirds.
Once cool, remove it. The bowl must be placed on a water vessel below before firing.
Refire as before, covering it, but without cinnabar—only a white-fired bowl cover weighing three *jin*.
When the furnace cools, remove and pulverize finely. Add one *qian* of bright raw arsenic, knead with sour juice into pills.
Dry them, wrap in silver foil, and mix with one *fen* each of *juan qiao* (withered lotus receptacle) and sour juice to form a body-adherent paste.
Also, prepare a paste from sour juice herb and purple duckweed (in any quantity) for external application as body-adherent spheres.
Seal with *liu yi* mud, fire with three *jin* for one firing, reducing by two-thirds.
Once cool, remove it—one *qian* will transmute one *liang* and three *qi* of *sanqi*.

**Lead-Refined Danyang Powder**
Six *liang* of powder, white poplar (washed), *tu zhu* (cinnabar substitute), *bai shan* (white clay), table salt, *yu zan* (jade hairpin), four *liang* each; *dai zhe* (hematite), three *liang*; *chi shi zhi* (red halloysite), two *liang*; *qing fan* (green vitriol), four *liang*; rock crystal, four *liang*.
Grind all ingredients evenly into powder, then pound with rice vinegar into a paste.
First, use yellow wax proportionate to the powder’s quantity, shaping it into small pills.
Seal with the prepared medicine, dry, then melt the wax spheres to empty them, refilling with powder.
Seal the box’s opening with medicine, dry, bind with iron wire, and place in an iron pot. Boil in lead liquid for three days and nights.
Remove when black—one *qian* transmutes one *liang* of material, without requiring *gou mu* (hook mother).

**Queen Mother’s Palace: One-Month Cycle Method**
One *liang* of *fen shuang* (calomel), half a *liang* of mercury.
Grind the two ingredients together until no specks remain.
Take a chicken egg, pierce one end, and remove the yolk and white. Grind *zhang nao* (camphor) in any quantity, place inside the eggshell, swirl, then pour out.
Add the calomel-mercury mixture, then cover with *huang qin* (scutellaria) powder in any quantity.
Use another half eggshell to seal the opening.
Secure the medicine, place in a *wu zhi kui* (ignorance-sealing vessel), tamp firmly, and seal the vessel’s opening with additional sealing medicine.
Externally, bind with iron wire, set on a tripod stand, and nurture the vessel with paper ash. The ash on the crucible should be one *cun* and a half thick. The firing schedule is as follows:
*Mao-you* fire.
One day, one *liang*.

On the second day, the same.
On the third day, two *liang*.
On the fourth day, three *liang*.
On the fifth day, four *liang*.
On the sixth day, five *liang*.
On the seventh day, six *liang*.
On the eighth day, remove and grind finely again, then reuse the medicine and nurture for another seven days with the following firing schedule:
On the first day, two *liang*.
On the second day, three *liang*.
On the third day, four *liang*.
On the fourth day, five *liang*.
On the fifth day, six *liang*.
On the sixth day, seven *liang*.
On the seventh day, seven *liang*.
On the eighth day, remove; use one *qian* to transmute one *liang* of red silver into the supreme treasure.

**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac**
One *liang* of sal ammoniac, half a *liang* of mulberry ash frost.
Grind together, place in a box, and cover with an additional layer for sealing. Nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days, then add three *jin* of fire to calcine until glowing red. Allow to cool and retrieve the subdued fire.

**Alternative Method**
For each *liang*, use one piece of frankincense ground to powder. First melt the borax, then add the frankincense, stir until uniform, and pour out. Each *zi* can transmute one *liang*.

**Method for Dead Borax**
Four *liang* of borax, one *liang* of aged tangerine peel, two *liang* of *zhi mu* (anemarrhena).
Grind the above into a fine powder, heat in a crucible, add the sal ammoniac, and fan vigorously until molten. Pour out.

**Divine Immortal’s Elixir for Refining White Divine Cinnabar**
Half a *liang* each of cinnabar and sulfur, one *liang* of *di ru xiang* (dripping frankincense).
Grind the three ingredients into a fine powder, add a small amount of walnut meat, and grind into a mass. Wrap first in two layers of damp paper, then one layer of dry paper. Bind with hemp strips. Next, take one *qian* each of gall and alum, and half a *liang* of good *meng shi* (chlorite schist). Grind into a fine powder, add half a *liang* of purslane, and grind evenly. Mix with one *sheng* of rice vinegar, simmer over a slow fire to form a paste, and shape into cakes. Place the previously prepared medicinal ball at the center, then wrap in three to five layers of paper. Place in a box, tamp the surrounding space with lime until full, and seal the opening with honey-mixed clam powder. Externally, seal with salt clay and allow to dry. Dig a pit one *chi* and two *cun* deep and wide, use three *dou* of *jin su* (golden millet) fire. First place the box in the pit, then cover with millet husks, filling evenly and tamping firmly. Ignite from above and continue until the fire is exhausted. Wait until the smoke has completely dissipated and the vessel has cooled before opening the box. Then, use five *jin* of hard, mature fire to calcine, reducing the fire by three *jin*. Retrieve the medicine without losing a single speck. Again, use a *gan wo* (sweet crucible) to calcine until molten, then pour into the pit. The weight remains unchanged. This medicine is a transmuter: for every ten *liang* of refined cinnabar, use one *liang* of White Divine Elixir. Place together in a *gan guo* (sweet crucible), melt into a liquid, and when the sound of cicadas is heard, stir vigorously with a willow branch. When the sound ceases, pour into the pit to form an ingot, ready for use as desired.

**Method for Refining Cinnabar**
Ten *liang* of cinnabar.
First melt in a new iron pan, then add two *liang* of antelope horn and two *liang* of *tai yin xuan jing shi* (selenite) powder, stirring immediately. If the cinnabar disappears, do not be alarmed—intensify the fire and stir until it reappears. Pour the cinnabar onto the ground; it will lose half its weight. The refined cinnabar will be as white as snow, and when broken, its texture will be finely serrated—ideal for transmutation.

*Collected Writings on the Dao of Metal, Scroll Six Concludes*
*Collected Writings on the Dao of Metal, Scroll Seven*

**Method for Making Iron Resemble Silver Using Lychee Pits**
Grind lychee pits into powder, then stir-fry the cinnabar. When the pit powder turns to ash, remove it and stir-fry again. Add to boiling water with oxhide glue three to five times; the cinnabar will become as lovely as silver, with a powdery pink hue, weighing three to five *fen*, and will not darken or tarnish.

**Alternative Method for Copper**
Use the roots of *gu chui cao* (drumstick grass) to fill a box and smoke a crucible until it is thoroughly blackened. Add borax and melt into a liquid. When cool, the borax will congeal into a solid mass. Melt copper in a separate crucible, then add the hardened borax. The copper will separate, with red above and white below. Stir with a new red-hot tile strip, removing all floating impurities until the liquid resembles clear water—this is the ideal state.

**Method for Purifying Blackened Objects to Restore Their True Luster**
- One *liang* of saltpeter
- Five tubes of calomel
- Thirty *wen* of green alum
- One piece of pumice the size of two *qian*
- One piece of borax the size of the pumice

Grind the above into powder. Place the object in a pot, covering the bottom and top with the powder. Heat with fire, and the impurities within the object will separate. Once the blackness is removed, the object will be pure, lustrous, and precious—most effective when placed at the bottom of the pot.

**Method for Softening Staffs**
Grind fifty parts frankincense with one *liang* of nitre. For each *liang* of staff material, add one *qian* of the mixture—adding more will make it too soft.

**Method for Drawing Blood**
- Five *wen* of *mu lü* (high-quality)
- Five *wen* of arsenic

Melt one *liang* of staff material into a liquid. Wrap the above ingredients in paper, stir evenly into the molten metal, and pour into a mold. Cover with damp paper, and it will turn white.

**Alternative Method**
- Five *wen* of dried scorpions
- Five *wen* of arsenic

Grind finely as before, add to the molten metal, stir evenly, and pour out—it will also turn white.

**Method for Transmuting with Dead Arsenic**
- Four *liang* of arsenic, finely ground
- Fifteen *chuan lian* seeds
- Two *liang* each of *gu jing cao* and *wu ye teng*

Chop each ingredient finely, stir-fry until black and charred (retaining their properties), then grind into powder. Mix with the previously prepared arsenic, adding one and a half *qian* of silver and one *qian* of frankincense. (These two may be omitted if desired.)

Use a porcelain white bottle as a water-fire vessel, filling it with four cups of water. Once cooled and opened, the result will resemble jade-like silver—most pleasing. The transmuting agent will settle at the bottom of the cup, with one and a half *qian* sufficient to transmute one *liang*. Adjust quantities as needed.

**Method for Rendering Dead Arsenic Safe**
Use any amount of arsenic, boiling it in mulberry wood ash lye for three full days. Then process it in a water-fire vessel to subdue its fire. If not fully subdued, boil and process again. This can be used with chalcanthite, lead powder, cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, and mother cinnabar—all will be effective.

**Alternative Method**
Use *mai men dong*, cockscomb flower, and *jin suo tian*.

Take the juice of these three ingredients, boil for one day, then discard the plant residue. This subdues the fire.

**Alternative Method**
Use *che qian zi* and camphorwood root.
Pound to extract the juice, mix with arsenic powder, and wrap together with the medicinal residue. Place in a container and nurture with slow fire for three days, then use a strong fire to subdue it.

**Alternative Method**
Take one *liang* each of *mu lü* and arsenic, grind finely, and kill. First heat a crucible until glowing red, then place the two ingredients inside. After a long while, apply a strong fire to subdue them.

**Alternative Method**
Spread a layer of *pi li zi* powder at the bottom of a crucible, add a layer of arsenic, then a layer of medicinal powder. Alternate layers of arsenic and medicinal powder three or four times. On top, place a layer of saltpeter, then a layer of *bai hu*, filling the mouth tightly. Seal firmly, allow to dry, then apply a strong fire until the contents turn dark. Once cooled, remove and grind to powder.

**Alternative Method**
Use *ku lian* tree bark and *qian niu zi*.
Grind these two ingredients into powder and spread at the bottom. Cover with arsenic, seal, and apply fire to render it inert.

**Alternative Method**
Take three *liang* each of arsenic and saltpeter, grind into fine powder, and wrap the arsenic-saltpeter mixture in *kun lun* paper. Then take three *liang* of *bai hu* powder, spread a layer at the bottom of the crucible, place the wrapped arsenic-saltpeter in the center, and cover with another three *liang* of *bai hu* powder, filling the mouth completely. Press tightly, seal, and allow to dry. Apply fire gradually from low to high, then use a strong fire to calcine. Once cooled, retrieve the product.

**Four White Ingredients Five-Fold Transmutation Method**
This may also be used in a vessel to subdue and render arsenic inert.
Two *liang* of arsenic, one *liang* of *fen shuang*, half a *liang* each of southern borax and *nao sha*.
Grind together into powder, wrap tightly in a silver strip, then wrap again in silk. Take one *liang* each of *bai you*, *bai lian*, *cao wu*, and *zhi mu*, grind into powder, and spread at the bottom of a new large earthen pot. Place the silk-wrapped packet on top, then cover with the herbal powder, pressing firmly. Fill the top with clean yellow earth. Use three *jin* of fire to calcine until slightly red, then remove. Cover with a pile of fresh earth and let sit briefly before reheating.
Repeat this process five times, each for one *ke*. On the fifth *ke*, cover with earth until fully cooled. Remove and form into small pieces. Use two *qian* to transmute one *liang* of base metal.

**Bone-Transforming Method**
Take equal parts of aged arsenic and *fen shuang*, grind together into fine powder.
Mix with the natural juice of fresh ginger to form a paste, wrap tightly in white silk, and coat the exterior thickly with a mixture of honey and powdered *da ji* and *juan xiang*. Place in a box, seal the opening with a paste of clam powder and oil.
Then seal the exterior with paper-fiber and mud, allow to dry, and calcine with fire until a fragrance is detected. Remove, grind into powder, and use one *qian* to transmute one *liang* of base metal.
For superior results, add mother cinnabar in a 50-50 ratio; for medium results, use a 40-60 ratio; for lower results, a 30-70 ratio.

**Method for Subduing *Fen Shuang***
Take one *liang* of *fen shuang* and three *qian* of silver filings, cut finely, and grind together into an extremely fine powder. Wrap tightly in boiled silk. Use the juice of fresh ginger, knotweed, or—if unavailable—scallion root juice or camphorwood root juice, and boil until the liquid is fully absorbed and dry. Remove, trim away the "umbilical cord," and wrap in a silver dish.
Take one cup each of the aforementioned juices, and grind *qiang hua*, *chen pi*, and *du zhong* into coarse powder. Place in a crucible and heat until smoke nearly dissipates. Quickly add half a *liang* of alum to the crucible, then place the wrapped *fen shuang* inside. Cover with more alum powder and fan with a bellows until dry. Remove once cooled and set aside for use.

**Alternative Method**
Take half a *liang* each of *zi shen*, *zhi mu*, and *tian men dong*, grind into fine powder, and mix with fresh ginger juice to form a paste. Coat the exterior of the medicinal ball.
Next, take three dried persimmons, chew thoroughly into a paste. Take thirty *Qingzhou* dates, remove the pits, and pound into a paste. Wrap the medicinal ball again.
Seal with paper-fiber and salt mud, then calcine with five *jin* of fire. Once the fire has diminished by more than half, turn the ball and calcine again. When the fire is exhausted, remove the ball and plunge into a water pit. After a long while, retrieve and allow to cool briefly. Test over fire—if not fully subdued, repeat the calcination until glowing red, no more than three times, to achieve fire resistance.
When transmuting, use a pinch of borax and *nao sha* for best results.

**Alternative Method**
Use camphorwood root (also called *dang lu*).
Dry in the sun, burn to ash, and leach to obtain the juice. Place in a porcelain bottle, then leach the ash again twice with the concentrated juice. Boil the ash juice until dry, place in a box, seal the opening, and calcine the powder to subdue the fire.

**Alternative Method**
Spread *tie jiao po luo men cao* at the bottom of a crucible, place the powder in the center, and cover the top with a paste made from *bi ma zi*. Secure a water cup on top of the crucible with iron wire and process in a water-fire vessel.
If not subdued, alternate fire above and water below three to five times to render the fire inert.
There are other methods, some for transmuting *mao* into *danyang*, which are extraordinarily effective.

**Method for White Calcination**
First, form the powder into pellets using *chu* juice, then dry in the sun. Next, wrap them in fine silk, then take one bowl each of *di lian*, *yan cao*, and *ji chang cao* juices. Enclose the wrapped medicine within a vessel, suspend it, and boil for one full day—slow heat is best. Then apply a concealing medicine to the body: grind equal parts *huang lian*, *huang xiang*, *huang qin*, *cao long dan*, and *ku zhang* into powder, mix with vinegar, and coat the wrapped medicine to a thickness of one inch. Cluster five *jin* of fire around it, reducing the fire by three-tenths. Remove the fire and cover the kiln with damp earth. This powder requires no clay pellets—this is the *Yuanwu* Master’s method.

**Four White Substances for Concealing Various Materials or *Danyang***
- Four *liang* of subdued *pi*
- Six *liang* of subdued *liu*
- Half a *liang* of subdued *fen shuang*
- Two and a half *qian* of subdued *xiao*

**Subduing *Pi***
Take a large *dang lu* root, cut a piece, hollow a cavity, place a small piece of *pi* inside, then boil in the root’s natural juice. When the large root turns black, the fire is subdued. If not subdued, replace with another root as the base, take fresh juice, and boil again—then the fire will be subdued. Repeatedly verified.

**Subduing *Sha***
Grind *di fu zi* into powder, mix evenly, and calcine in a sealed crucible. Alternatively, use *zi bei hu er cao* or *tian qie er* powder—both can subdue *liu*. Repeatedly verified.

**Subduing *Fen Shuang***
Boil in wild redflower root juice to subdue.

**Subduing *Xiao***
Pound *ce qiao* branches and leaves to extract juice, then stir-fry to subdue. Alternatively, pound *ce wu* leaves into a paste, spread half on the bottom, place *xiao* inside, cover with the remaining paste, and calcine with intense fire until it melts into a jade-like mass—ready for use. Repeatedly verified.

Once the four substances are subdued, place them in a water-fire vessel, add seven or eight cups of water, then calcine with intense fire until truly inert—ready for concealing. To make *Danyang*, add two and a half *qian* of *ru xiang* and two and a half *qian* of *huang dan* into the vessel, process, then remove to apply to materials.

**Mother Cinnabar Method**
Two *liang* of mother, eight *liang* of mercury.
Shape the mother into a dish and place it in the vessel. Add mercury onto the dish, then cover with medicinal powder as follows: *chuan jiao*, *xi xin*, *huang wu*, *gan lao*, tea leaves, and *jing jie*—each three *qian*, ground into powder, to cover the mother and mercury. Then calcine with one *cheng* of charcoal until complete. Remove the cinnabar, cut into dice-like blocks, boil in honey mixed with *mi tuo seng* powder, then place in a lead concealing vessel to nurture.

**Method for Making Dead Lead into a Concealing Vessel**
One *jin* of lead, half a *jin* of *yan xiao*.
First melt the *xiao* in a crucible, then add the lead and boil for one day. Remove, grind into powder, soak in boiling water, and dry in the sun to form the concealing vessel—use four *liang*.

Place the previous cinnabar into the vessel, apply four *liang* of *mao-you* fire, and nurture for three days. Remove and prepare the kiln medicine as follows:

**Treasure-Ruining Medicine**
Mix equal parts buckwheat ash and *xin* into powder, form into balls with water, calcine, and grind into powder. Add equal parts *dan fan*, *bai yao yu* powder, *ding tou*, and calcined *dai zhe shi*, along with one *liang* of *yan xiao*. Melt in fire, then add twenty *wen* of *shao fen* and twenty *wen* of *peng sha*. Grind into powder—use three *qian* each to line the bottom and top, then calcine one *liang* of cinnabar.

**Lead Calcination Method**
Half a *jin* of black lead.
Place in an iron pan and stir-fry with a large bamboo whisk. Add *yan xiao* powder and continue frying until the lead is dry. For each *liang* of lead, use half a *liang* of *xiao* powder.

Place the lead powder into a sand container, insert the mercury-cinnabar ball (remove the silk wrapping), cover with powder, and seal the concealing vessel with iron wire. Seal the outer seams with *shi zhi* mixed with vinegar. Place in the furnace, dry with paper ash, then sift and prepare the furnace. Position the container inside, place one *liang* of charcoal on top, and ignite for one day and night. Repeat for three days and nights. When the fire is sufficient, remove and place in a pit. Press down with the aforementioned medicinal herbs, then seal the surface with salt. Apply intense fire to melt into liquid.

**Method for Forming Mother Cinnabar**
Five *liang* of mercury.

Two *liang* of silver. Combine these two substances in a mortar. Then take two *liang* of *zhimu* (Anemarrhena asphodeloides), decoct finely, and pour the liquid into the previous ingredients. Grind together until thoroughly blended, stopping once the substance is formed. If not yet achieved, decoct again and continue grinding. Then strain through white paper to form pellets the size of bullets, securing them with thread. Next, take two *sheng* of sour vinegar water (or ginger juice if vinegar water is unavailable) and place in a clean jar. Suspend the cinnabar pellet by its thread into the jar and boil for one *fu* period. Remove and place in a basin of cold water, whereupon the substance will harden.

**Adhesive for Personal Use**
Equal parts *chuanjiao* (Zanthoxylum bungeanum), *chuanwu* (Aconitum carmichaelii), and *xixin* (Asarum heterotropoides). Use raw, grind into powder, mix with honey, and apply to the cinnabar pellet. Place in a clean area to dry, then store in a *guizi* (concealing vessel).

**Method for the Concealing Vessel**
Three *liang* of black lead, one *jin* of lime, and one and a half *liang* of *dansha* (sal ammoniac). First, melt the black lead in a wok until liquid. Add the lime and stir evenly. Then add the *dansha*, stirring with an iron spoon until it becomes a liquid. Pour onto the ground to cool, then remove. Place in an earthenware box, level the surface, and arrange the sand as in the lotus-nurturing method. Next, mix *gefen* (clam powder) and salt with water to form a paste, sealing the mouth of the box. Take a new tile basin, fill it with ash, and bury the box at its center, covering it with ash. Use one and a half *jin* of firewood, gradually adding more over one *fu* period. The next day, use another one and a half *jin* of firewood, following the same method. On the third day, use three *jin* of firewood, again adding gradually, for another *fu* period. Once cooled, remove and boil in *wumei* (Prunus mume) water for one *shi* period, then refine into a treasure.

**Method for Forming *Geng* Cinnabar**
One *qian* of *geng* (metallic essence) and three *qian* of mercury. Use half a cup of pure sesame oil, add one *gualouzi* (Trichosanthes kirilowii seed), and decoct until the medicinal pellet turns yellow. Add another seed, repeating until seven seeds have been used. Gradually add six to seven *fen* of *baijiaoxiang* (resin), decoct briefly, then pour and knead to form. Wash thoroughly with hot water to remove medicinal residue until the cinnabar pellet gleams. Fill with *wumei* pits, then apply cinnabar to the surface. Next, coat the exterior with *baimei* (Prunus mume) pulp, then mix *caowu* (Aconitum kusnezoffii) powder with vinegar and apply all over. Wrap entirely in paper and mud, then bake until dry. Cover the top with ash and surround with fire on all sides, nurturing for one night until the cinnabar emerges. Then mix *ziheche* (placenta) powder with honey and apply in a layer over silk. Next, mix equal parts *xixin* (Asarum heterotropoides), *caowu* (Aconitum kusnezoffii) powder, *baihe* (Lilium brownii), and *jiangzi* (Croton tiglium), blend with honey, and apply another layer. Seal externally with salt mud, allow to dry, then place in the furnace and nurture with starlight fire for one *hui* period.

**Method for Following the Mother with Three Essences**
One *qian* of *geng* and one *fen* of mercury. Combine these two to form cinnabar. Add one *qian* of cinnabar. Grind all three together evenly, mix with *yuxingcao* (Houttuynia cordata) juice to form pellets, then roll in *huangfan* (yellow vitriol) as an adhesive layer, with *jinfan* (potash alum) as the outer seal. When refining silver, use *jinfan* as the adhesive layer and *huangfan* as the outer seal. Wrap in paper and place on *yinshi* (mica or similar mineral) overnight. Then finely grind *yuxingcao*, apply as an adhesive layer one finger thick. Next, use *huanghua* (dayflower), *jichangcao* (Acalypha australis), and *shemao* (five-leaved snake grass), pound into a paste, and apply another layer one finger thick. Then mix one *liang* of charcoal ash and one *qian* of *qingyan* (green salt), decoct with water to form a concealing vessel called the "willow floss vessel." Use five to six *jin* of mature fire for one *hui* period. Once the medicine has passed through, remove and refine in the furnace.

Jade and mica: Take two *liang* of each, boil in one bowl of rice vinegar until fully absorbed, then dry by baking. Store in a porcelain box, using half a *liang* of the mixture to cover each *liang* of the substance. Refine by *hui*, dissolve in water, and reuse.

**Cinnabar Gold Method**
Use four *liang* of large cinnabar chunks, wrap in silk, and suspend for steeping as follows: Combine one *liang* each of *diyu* (burnet), *chushizi* (paper mulberry fruit), *baji* (morinda root), and *gansui* (kan-sui root). Grind these into fine powder, divide into four packets, and boil in good rice vinegar for one *fu* period. Add vinegar once and medicine once in four stages until fully boiled, then remove the cinnabar.

Take one *liang* of silver and four *qian* of *geng* (metal essence), melt together, hammer into foil, and cut into pieces. Wrap and stir-fry as in the lotus-seed method, placing the cinnabar inside. Mix honey with *mituoseng* (litharge) powder for an adhesive layer half a grain of rice thick. Then blend refined honey with *yuxingcao* root and *lizhicao* (lychee grass) powder, applying another adhesive layer one grain of rice thick. Place in a *qingyan* (green salt) vessel with four *liang* of fire, nurture for seven days. Remove when cool, place on a brick, refine with three *jin* of charcoal fire for one *hui*, then cool again. Transfer to a crucible for forging, then boil with *yan* (salt), *fan* (alum), and *dan* (chalcanthite) until fully processed. Pour repeatedly, refining dozens of times to form the treasure.

**Vessel-Making Method**
Take half a *jin* of *qingyan* (green salt), boil with two bowls of lotus root juice until dry, then bake. Place in a crucible, forge into liquid, pour out, and grind into fine powder after a short while. Store in a box, first placing dead white salt at the bottom, then *qingyan*, and finally dead white *yan* (salt) on top. Seal the seams with clam powder mixed with vinegar. Dead white *yan* is prepared by forging with *zhimu* (anemarrhena).

**Refining Divine Sand Method**
Take eight *liang* of mercury, first with one and a half *liang* of sulfur, half a *liang* of *dilei* sulfur, half a *liang* of realgar, and one *qian* of orpiment. Grind the three yellows into powder, stir-fry into "blue-gold head" according to the method, then place in an upper vessel with water below. Refine with fire to form divine sand, yielding one or two *qian* as a gift.

**Boiling Method**
Use equal parts of *qianghua* (wolfsbane), *wubei* (Chinese gall), *daji* (euphorbia), *chuanjiao* (Sichuan pepper), *langdu* (wolf’s-bane root), lotus leaf ash, two *qian* of *naosha* (sal ammoniac), and white alum. Grind into powder, boil with river water and vinegar for three days, then place in a silver vessel with four *liang* of *yan*. Nurture for one *liang* of time. Adhesive layer medicine: three *qian* of *danfan* (chalcanthite), half a *liang* of *xipeng* (borax), and one *qian* of cinnabar. Grind these three into powder, mix with honey, apply, and nurture with fire for seven days before removing to stir-fry.

**Herbal Vessel Method**
Use equal parts of *nanxing* (arisaema), *langdu*, *wujia pi* (acanthopanax bark), *jingjie* (schizonepeta), *huangqin* (skullcap), *huanglian* (coptis), *diyu*, *chuanjiao*, and *huangshukui* (yellow hollyhock). Grind into powder, mix with honey to form a paste, place in a box, and seal. Refine with three *liang* of fire, nurture for seven days. Then boil two *liang* of *momei* (dark plum), two *liang* each of white alum, white *yan*, and *wubei*. Grind these three into powder, boil for one *fu* period with river water, then remove to wash and stir-fry with four *liang* of fire. Pour mercury twice, nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days. Repeat this pouring process only twenty times, avoiding the sprouting stage.

**Furnace-Refining Method**
Place one *liang* of *huangdan* (lead oxide) in a pot first, with the sprout in the center, then cover with half a *liang* of *huangdan*. Place in the furnace, fan into liquid, remove, break the crucible, and form a single treasure.

**Ge the Immortal’s Nine-Turn Divine Sand Gold Elixir**
**Shell-Shedding, Womb-Changing Divine Sand Method**
Take five *liang* of cinnabar, two *liang* each of sulfur and *qingyan*, two and a half *liang* of *wubei*, and three and a half *qian* of *naosha*. Combine with cinnabar, boil in rice vinegar for one period. If the liquid evaporates, add more vinegar and continue boiling. Remove the cinnabar and use *danfan* as the adhesive layer.

**Boiling Chalcanthite Method**
Take two *liang* of duck-beak *danfan*, one *fen* of *poxiao* (mirabilite), two *liang* of edible *yan*, and two *liang* of mercury. Grind these four ingredients together, steam overnight, then place in a raw iron pan. Boil with river water over a charcoal fire until bubbling. If the liquid reduces, replenish with hot water—never use cold water. Boil continuously for a day or half a day, then use an iron spoon to scoop mercury from the pan’s bottom. When it forms sand, stop. Discard the remaining medicine, retaining only the mercury sand. Wash with water, dry with paper, and reuse. Wrap the sand in two layers of paper to absorb excess mercury, then separate the sand into individual pieces. Place the sand in a clean iron pan, cover with a *jian* bowl, seal the bowl’s edges with paper, and place over a slow fire. After a long while, remove from heat and retrieve the sand. The truly dead sand will settle as purple chunks at the pan’s bottom, while the undead will fly onto the bowl. Grind the dead sand into powder, mix with honey-boiled cinnabar, and coat the mercury sand evenly. Then wrap with three-seven mother sand.

**Forming Three-Seven Mother Sand Method**
Take three *qian* of *shanzeyin* (mountain-marsh silver) powder and seven *qian* of mercury. Grind these two together to form sand, then thinly and evenly coat the honey-treated cinnabar pieces. If the summer heat prevents solidification, repeat the process. Spread cinnabar in an iron pan as before, cover with a purple bowl, seal the edges with damp paper, and place over a slow fire to expel excess mercury. Once fully expelled, add five *liang* of *shanzeyin* powder to cover the cinnabar, then top with one *liang* of *huangdan*. Alternatively, use eight *liang* of silver powder and two *liang* of *huangdan*, seal the edges with salt-clay, dry, place in an ash pit, and nurture with four *liang* of mature charcoal fire from the *yin* hour for three days and nights.

Once the nurturing period is complete, remove the cinnabar, discarding the silver powder. This marks the first cycle, wherein the common matrix is purged, and the Mother is no longer used.

**Method for Adding Mercury, Nurturing with Fire, and Harvesting Yellow Sprouts**
Take three *liang* of Mother Sand refined into cinnabar and place it back into the vessel. Add two *liang* of mercury, pouring it over the cinnabar, then seal and allow to dry. Place in the ash pit, using five *liang* of charcoal, with four *liang* of mature fire arranged atop the vessel, and cover with ash. After noon, replenish with another four *liang*. By the end of the first watch, add more. Replenish at three intervals—morning, evening, and night—for three days and nights. Open the vessel to inspect: if yellow sprouts have formed atop the cinnabar, add one *liang* of mercury, reseal, and nurture with fire for another three days and nights. Examine again for yellow sprouts. Once sprouts appear around the vessel’s rim, pour an additional twenty-four *liang* of mercury, nurture, and harvest. Collect these for the Great Elixir, transforming them into the elixir.

**Method for Transforming the Great Elixir**
Do not remove the sprouts that have formed within the vessel. Instead, pour four *liang* of mercury into it and seal the seams with red halloysite. First, place a water jar beneath the vessel, positioning the vessel over its mouth. Fill the space with paper ash, ensuring a two-inch layer atop the vessel. Arrange four *liang* of mature fire on top. Replenish the fire at the *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours, using no more than four *liang* each time. Nurture thus for two and a half days, then remove the water jar and refill it. Continue this process for a total of five days and nights. Open the vessel and pour in another four *liang* of mercury, maintaining the same fire regimen. Nurture for one month, repeating this six times, each with four *liang* of mercury—totaling twenty-four *liang*. Upon opening the vessel, harvest the yellow sprouts that have ascended to the top, collecting eight *liang*, ten *liang*, or even one *jin*, and store them separately for the Great Elixir’s nurturing, where they will transform through the surging spring. The remaining sprouts at the vessel’s base, which have not ascended, are unusable; combine them with the original cinnabar and refine them with herbal decoctions to form a usable product.

**Method for Refining the Nine-Turn Golden Elixir and Its Consumption**
**First, Pass the Yellow Sprouts Through the Flowery Pool to Transform the Great Elixir’s Fire Regimen**

**Secret of the Flowery Pool**
To transmute dry mercury into silver,
Rely on salt and acid as the master.
With fierce flames of saltpeter and alum,
Swiftly transcend the mortal to attain the sacred truth.

Borax, saltpeter, white alum, and table salt—one *liang* each.
Grind these four ingredients finely and place them in a crucible, layering them evenly above and below. Position the previously harvested yellow sprouts in the center. Mix half a bowl of paper mulberry juice with one *sheng* of rice vinegar, then gradually drip the mixture onto the medicine until the mercury permeates the base. Cover with a purple bowl and wait until all the vinegar is exhausted. Apply intense fire to drive off moisture, then seal tightly and continue heating until the contents are thoroughly dried and charred. Reduce the fire, allow to cool, and remove for washing.

**Second Washing Secret**
The purple robe and silver belt gleam bright,
Seal the vessel’s mouth—do not disclose this lightly.
With *hanfangji* as aid,
Grind the sprouts together in water.

Purple grass, lime, *hekou* pepper, and *hanfangji*—one *liang* each.
Combine these four ingredients and decoct them in a strong infusion of *shanglu* root in a clay pot, yielding three bowls of liquid. Strain and use this medicinal water to wash the sprouts that have already passed through the Flowery Pool. Do not use plain water. Place the sprouts in a purple bowl and gently heat to dry them, ensuring all moisture is expelled. Then, cleanse them thoroughly and expose them to the open air for one night to absorb the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth before returning them to the furnace.

**Secret of the Surging Spring’s Longevity Fire**
After the yellow sprouts have undergone the Flowery Pool and one washing, expose them to the open air for one night to receive the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Then place them back in the vessel, seal as before, and nurture them. Every five days, pour in four *liang* of mercury. The regimen requires two and a half days with water below and fire above, followed by two and a half days with water above and fire below, completing the five-day cycle of water and fire.

When water is below, fill a jar with water, place the vessel over its mouth, and bury it in a ceramic container filled with paper ash. Apply fire above. When fire is below, use an iron tripod to support the vessel, placing the fire beneath and a water jar atop the vessel. This alternates water and fire above and below.

When applying fire at the *yin* hour, use one *liang* of mature fire and observe for three hours. The next day, use two *liang*. Gradually increase to sixteen *liang*, then reduce the fire back to one *liang*—this is the method of accelerating the fire. If a day is missed, compensate accordingly. After a full month of nurturing, use only one *liang* of fire daily—this is the gradual progression of fire. By adjusting the fire thus, the mercury will never be exhausted. Additionally, invert the sprouts.

When inverted sprouts manifest as five-colored purple powder, harvest the purple powder that forms atop the vessel upon each opening and store it in a silver container. Place it in a sacred chamber’s crucible to transform into the Great Elixir. Collect the remaining sprouts as treasures. After fifteen days, perform another Flowery Pool washing—this is also beneficial.

Master Bao Zhenren said:
Without the Flowery Pool, the result will not be refined;
Even if powder forms, it will scatter when burned.
This aligns with the principle.

For all fire-nurturing methods, follow this secret without deviation, and transformation will naturally occur, attaining spiritual communion with the Dao of creation.
As the *Book of Changes* states: *"The waxing and waning of the sun and moon follow the celestial course."*
This is the hidden secret of the Surging Spring’s fire regimen, preserved within Wei Boyang’s *Triple Concordance*.

When the Five Colors enter the Purple River Cart, follow the regimen of nurturing the Surging Spring—each time you water the open-and-close, suddenly the entire vessel sprouts buds: some purple, some jade-green, some like tea-dust, some purple-red, some white-glowing, or their original hue. If you encounter the yellow-earth color or golden hue in the process of attaining immortality, these are the true auspicious colors. Without fail, after each watering, transfer them to the crucible. If the purple powder has not yet been collected, verify the secret of the Five Colors.

The *Golden Elixir Formula of Lord Yin the True* states:
Cinnabar is called "lush green,"
Yet without the elixir, one cannot consume it.
The celestial and terrestrial patterns form,
The yin-yang numbers are then complete.
Above coils the Yellow Dragon,
Below crouches the White Tiger.
One substance bears five colors,
Eternally serving as the immortal’s bounty.

Master Purple Radiance also said:
The Purple Dragon coils atop,
The White Tiger contains essence and qi.
Those who close their doors to study
Do not stray from the *Triple Concordance*.

In general, when cultivating the elixir, if you see the Five Colors manifesting as "dust in a bright window," this is the numinous transformation of the elixir. When the open-and-close vessel reveals the Five Colors, take refined silver and hammer it into a thin sheet—one, two, or three pieces—matching the size of the vessel containing the Yellow Sprout. Make the edges thick and the center thin, then press it onto the cinnabar vessel as a lid. Continue the daily fire-nurturing as before, and naturally, purple powder will form on the silver sheet. Every five days, open the vessel and use a goose-feather brush to gather the powder into a silver container. When you have collected two taels, transfer it to the sacred chamber for further transformation. The purple powder will naturally ascend in qi and coalesce—not as cinnabar or mercury in substance, but as their quintessence.

**Method for Transforming Purple Powder in the Sacred Chamber**
Fashion a vessel from fine silver and place the purple powder inside—two, three, or four taels. First, take three qian of fine gold, hammer it into foil, and cut it into pieces. Place them in a small crucible, heat the gold until slightly red, then remove the crucible. Quickly pour in seven qian of mercury, immediately stirring with an iron rod to form cinnabar. Wash the cinnabar-mercury with hot water, dry it with paper, and shape it into three pellets. Steep them in a strong solution of wood-ash lye mixed with dew-water, boiling for half a day or a full day until firm, then remove. Bury the pellets within the powder in the silver vessel, then place the vessel in an ash bath. Nurture with civil and martial fire for seven days. Remove the cinnabar pellets, refine them in a qi furnace to form a treasure—without the slightest loss. This powder is numinous.

The sacred chamber is none other than the silver vessel. It must be encased in a sand vessel, sealing the silver vessel within, before being nurtured with civil and martial fire—six taels each morning and evening.

If the purple powder is not further transformed to nurture the golden cinnabar, this treasure may be consumed directly. Grind the purple powder into a fine powder, mix it with paper-mulberry juice to form pills the size of sesame seeds, and let them dry. Coat them in yellow wax, wrap them in silk, and soak them in flowing water for forty-nine days—or in fresh well water. Only after soaking may they be taken: one pill on an empty stomach, washed down with well-flower water. Consuming this elixir repels all malevolent influences, bestows longevity and bliss, and grants the status of an earthly immortal. Your bones and marrow will become as unyielding as metal and stone, and your numinous transformations will be indestructible.

If the purple powder, resembling "dust in a bright window," is not yet ready for consumption, subject it to nine further transformations of the Golden Elixir to nurture the Great Medicine into spiritual communion.

**First Transformation: Golden Liquid Returning Elixir**
How many refine lead and mercury?
The numinous path grows ever more subtle.
Cold forests deepen with green waters,
Red powder flows with the waves.
Refined into true gold’s hue,
Its radiance gleams like autumn moonlight.
Guard it well with you,
Lest it slip away to the mundane.

Master Purple Blossom said: Harvest the Yellow Sprout finely, wash it with water, and let the particles that float with the water enter the crucible to nurture the Great Medicine. Follow the previous method of fire-nurturing, advancing and retreating with water and fire—there is another transformation for the water-washed portion. The particles that do not float with the water become white cinnabar, which can be refined into treasure. The portion that floats with the water is gold—the golden essence of the Yellow Sprout.

**Second Transformation: Method for Adding Mercury to the Yellow Sprout to Produce Medicine**
Cold springs flow with white snow,
Adding mercury, sprouts anew.
Honey-sealed in the golden crucible,
Burned into purple chrysanthemums.
Fragrant leaves take flight,
Gradually coalescing into blossoms.
Few know this path,
Forgetting worldly cares, one must not boast.

Master Leaf said: First, wash five taels of white cinnabar Yellow Sprout with water, then place it in the Flowery Pool and add five taels of mercury. Rest it upon water to form cinnabar pellets. Arrange them in the crucible, seal it tightly, and place it in the furnace. Nurture with civil and martial fire for one day and night. Then add another five taels of mercury, following the previous fire regimen, and nurture for seven days—all will become treasure, further attaining spiritual communion.

**Third Transformation: Refining the "Dust in a Bright Window" to Cultivate the Six Qi**
How many numinous transformations?
The true adept acts as the supreme matchmaker.
Cold clouds stretch to the earth’s axis,
The yin tiger spurs the yang thunder.
Two qi surge as blue radiance,
Three peaks pile with jade snow.
Harmonizing the true wondrous principle
Requires the催 of the Great Yang.

Take two taels of "dust in a bright window" and one tael of raw sulfur. Grind both finely, place them in a crucible, with the "dust in a bright window" lining the bottom and top, and the sulfur-dust mixture in between. Cover with more "dust in a bright window," seal it tightly, and place it in the furnace. Nurture with fire for five days. Remove and grind everything into a fine powder. Then add five taels of raw sulfur, grind it finely, mix with paper-mulberry juice to form pills the size of mung beans. Each pill can transmute one tael of mercury into treasure. If it lacks numinosity, nurture it for another twenty-one days.

**Fourth Transformation: Refining the "Dust in a Bright Window" to Cultivate the Purple River Cart**
Gather the sun’s essence,
Purify the heart to refine the purple sprout.
The Jade True One is not far,
Abide in the Dao, and the Dao has no bounds.

The jade laughter piles into treasure,
Yellow gold fills my home.
Yet it is the inner treasure of the heart,
How could it be used for arrogance or extravagance?

To the right: Take five taels of "dust in a bright window" and place it within the divine chamber—the Chamber of the Great One. Use five taels of mercury, shaped like lotus seeds, nestled within the "dust in a bright window." Seal tightly with honey, then place it in the furnace as before. Nurture with fire for seven days until all becomes true sprouts, forming strands. When melted, it becomes gold of the finest hue; that which flies to the top of the crucible is the powder of the Purple River Cart.

**Fifth Transformation: The Purple River Cart Transmutes into Yellow Ascension**
Yellow Ascension is the true Dao,
Its transformations flow like a river’s ford.
Do not speak of it to the common folk,
Keep its mysteries hidden, do not reveal them.
Refine the essence, temper the gold ten thousandfold,
Consumed, it dispels the three spirits.
The true congeals in the wondrous source of the Dao,
Only then may one approach the Celestial Lord.

To the right: Take five taels of the Purple River Cart, grind it finely into powder, and place it within the divine chamber. Seal as before, then nurture with fire in the furnace for forty-nine days. Remove, and it will have transformed into Yellow Ascension. Grind it into powder, mix with paper-mulberry juice to form pills the size of hemp seeds, coat them with yellow wax, and soak in water for forty-nine days to dispel the fire toxin. Take one pill on an empty stomach with weak wine. This elixir can restore the hun and po, reviving the dead.

**Sixth**
Grind the Yellow Ascension into powder and place it within the divine chamber’s crucible. Nurture with fire for twenty-one days, then remove and grind finely. Mix with jujube pulp to form pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill daily on an empty stomach with wine or well-flower water. For those with yang decline, qi exhaustion, or spirit disarray, it fortifies yang, restores vitality, and redoubles strength, reversing aging and restoring youth—its efficacy is unfathomable.

**Seventh: The Divine Transformation of the Purple Gold Elixir**
Place the powder of the Purple River Cart back into the divine chamber and nurture with fire for forty-nine days.

**Eighth**
Nurture for one year, then open the furnace to separate and gather the five elixirs. Return them to the golden crucible and nurture with fire for consumption.
First named the Great Dragon-Tiger Elixir,
Second named the Divine Talisman White Snow,
Third named the Purple Tenuity Elixir,
Fourth named the Gold-Purple Elixir,
Fifth named the Golden Liquid Minor Numinous Elixir,
The ninth transformation is called the Golden Liquid Minor Return Elixir.

**Ninth**
The golden body arises naturally,
Hun and po unite in nature’s bond.
Open the furnace, the white snow takes flight,
The crucible brims, the red lotus unfolds.
Once a wandering traveler,
Now an immortal ascending with one’s abode.
The whole household roams the Purple Palace,
Rising to heaven in broad daylight.

To the right: Follow the steps in order, return to the golden crucible, and nurture with fire for one year. Purify body and mind, perform rites to thank heaven and earth, then open the furnace and remove the crucible. Gather the various elixirs—those that congeal into a true crimson hue are called the Great Dragon-Tiger Return Elixir. Consumed, it allows one to ascend to heaven in daylight, spiritually roam the Purple Palace, transforms chickens into phoenixes and dogs into dragons. This elixir revives the desiccated, restoring life to the dead. If the crucible’s contents all congeal into a red hue resembling lotus flowers, it is called the Purple Tenuity Elixir. If it remains purple without changing into other colors, it is called the Purple Gold Elixir. If the crucible’s contents all gleam with a golden radiance, it is called the Golden Liquid Minor Return Elixir.

**Celestial Treasure Longevity Divine Talisman Repository**
Take one catty of fine northern stone rouge as the standard. Remove stone debris, then use the roots, leaves, and flowers of *Orostachys fimbriatus* pounded into natural juice. Place the rouge in a silk bag, suspend it within a porcelain jar, and simmer over a slow fire for five days and nights—do not let the fire grow too strong. Avoid all iron implements. Once the time is complete, remove and place it in a jar, lining the bottom and top with the original herb dregs. Seal tightly and nurture with fire for seven days: three days with four taels of fire, three days with six taels, and one day with eight taels. Test the fire’s submission by placing a probe at the bottom. Remove, then calcine in a water-and-fire crucible until it melts into liquid. Remove, skim off the surface ash, and purify. Place in a sand jar and nurture for fourteen days, covering the top with the original dregs’ ash. For the first seven days, use three taels of fire; for the next seven days, four taels. Once complete, remove to form the repository.

**Divine Transformation White Snow**
Take four taels of frost powder from two crucibles as the standard. Boil in ginger juice for half a day, then shape into five-mace pieces, splitting them into thin slices. Lightly coat with honey, mix with raw yin, and for each tael, wrap in mother foil. Place in the repository and nurture for twenty-one days. The nurturing method requires observing the divine talisman’s essence and potency. Test on the fourteenth day—if the surface blackens, it is not yet complete. After twenty-one days, if the hun does not perish, extend the time and carefully monitor the fire’s timing. Use one tael of bone and one and a half mace of white snow to achieve the full treasure’s hue. If the fire’s power is sufficient, one mace can transmute one tael. If transmutation is desired, use the repository as the Longevity Repository to nurture the frost powder. If transmutation is not desired, employ another method to nurture the frost powder into a repository, extracting the frost powder as "dust in a bright window."

**White Snow Repository**
Take one catty of nurtured frost powder as the standard and place it in a sand jar with four taels of cinnabar. Boil with *Orostachys fimbriatus* for seven days, then place in the repository and nurture for seven days. Each day at dawn and dusk, monitor the fire: three days with three taels, three days with three and a half taels, and one day with four taels—until the cinnabar is truly dead. If mercury frost is not desired, follow the previous method for fourteen days; one mace can transmute one tael of silver.

**Congealing Frost**
Grind four taels of cinnabar into powder, then boil one tael of cinnabar with *Orostachys fimbriatus* for five days. Place in the repository, securing the ball with silk, and cover the top and bottom. Nurture for eight days: two days with two taels of fire, three days with three taels, and three days with four taels. Extract the cinnabar and use one tael of female mercury, boiling it with *Akebia quinata* for one day—replace when it turns black. Repeat this process ten times, then finely grind the female mercury and nurture together for seven days: two days with two taels of fire, three days with three taels, and two days with four taels. Again, finely grind the cinnabar and female mercury, then nurture for seven days. Once the fire nurturing is complete, extract one tael of the male’s refined essence, boil it with radish juice for one day, grind evenly, and combine all three substances. Nurture for seven days with the same fire regimen as before.

Again take one tael of refined sulfur, broken into pea-sized pieces, and boil it with *Tiankujia* for one day. Combine with the previous four substances and nurture for seven days with four taels of fire. These four substances will then become full-color gold.

For the transformation, take four taels of the Four Spirits as the standard measure, use six mace of thin mother sheets, and one tael four mace of mercury. Soak them together overnight, then grind into granules and form eight pills. Place them into the previous vessel, seal tightly, and set in an ash pool. Nurture for ten days with five taels of fire each day. Retrieve to obtain the most refined red gold.

For the communion with the Dao, take four taels of the extracted gold and hammer it into a single box. Take two taels of cinnabar, boil it with *Akebia quinata* for five days, then nurture it within the box for seven days with four taels of fire each day. Repeat this process to extract eight taels. Retrieve and for every tael of mercury, use one mace of cinnabar to form the supreme treasure.

**Method for Sprinkling:**
Mix tea powder with vinegar to a smooth paste, shape into small crucibles, and place mercury inside. Use one mace of elixir powder as the base, covering above and below. Seal with salt and place in a *jianzhan* bowl. Apply two catties of fire in one firing to produce full-color purple gold. This is the inner attainment of those who possess the Dao, capable of transmuting and refining the Great Elixir—an ability beyond ordinary men. Yet the utmost sincerity and dedication to aiding the poor are paramount.

**Infant and Womb of the Eight Perfected:**
Take two taels of high-quality cinnabar and one tael of raw sulfur, wrapping them separately. Boil in the pure juice of *Akebia quinata* for seven days. If unavailable, substitute with *Xuangong*, which is also highly effective. Retrieve and place the sulfur in an iron pan to stir-fry, then stir-fry the cinnabar with plant residue until the sulfur is exhausted. Use four mace of mother metal to form pearls, mix evenly, then take a black hen’s egg, hollow it out, and place the cinnabar and pearls inside. If the egg is insufficient, use additional eggshells to cover. Seal with egg white and *Kunlun* paper, wrapping seven layers, then secure with yellow mud to seal all seams. Crush eight catties of raw lead and place it above and below the egg, using an iron fork to hold the egg in place to prevent it from rising. Seal the vessel with tiles and cover with ash fire, applying gentle fire on all sides until the lead and tin melt. Maintain this fire regimen for seven days, then retrieve and remove the mother metal. Use half a tael of cinnabar powder placed inside a goose egg as a lining. Combine with ten taels of qi from the union of nine and one, place inside the goose egg, and nurture in a lead vessel for seven days as before. Retrieve, and the sprouts will emerge—a treasure of boundless creation. If no goose egg is available, take two taels of cinnabar and place it in a fifty-tael crucible or iron pot, then pour four taels of mercury inside. Follow the seven-day counter-pouring method to refine the mature substance into treasure, yielding endless creation and the sprouts of longevity. Even when mature, it may be divided into vessels. Those who possess the Dao will surely comprehend its transmutation.

**Plum-Nucleus White Silver Method:**
First, take one tael of black lead and one tael of mercury, place them together in a crucible, and stir-fry into granules. Next, wash and pound *Huanghua Diding* grass to extract its natural juice. Take one tael of cinnabar, purify it with lodestone to draw out iron-like impurities, then boil in the grass juice for a full day and night. Retrieve, dry in the sun, and bake until finely powdered. When using, take a *wubeizi* gall, measure its capacity, and if it holds two mace, first place one mace of cinnabar powder inside, then add half a portion of silver mother, followed by one mace of mercury granules. Seal the opening with pitch, then secure with *guanni* mud and red halloysite. Mark the opening of the *wubeizi* with a brush, dry in the sun, and place it in an iron incense burner. First, fill half the burner with powdered incense, place the *wubeizi* inside, then fill the rest with powdered incense and press firmly. Burn it at nightfall, and by dawn, retrieve the cooled ash. Break it open to reveal the treasure within.

**Collected Writings on the Metal Dao, Scroll Seven, Completed**

**The Nine-Turned Divine Cinnabar Elixir of Ascension to Immortality, Formula of the Perfected Lord Xu**

The Formula states:
Take four taels of transparent sulfur and first boil it with the juice of *Shuitian Gongzi* grass (the large floating duckweed on water, with round leaves and a cross-shaped vein pattern) for three full days. If unavailable, use *Qumai* powder boiled in river water, which is also effective. For the mercury, take one tael of *Guan Zhong*, one tael of *Wubei*, and one *fen* of transparent pine resin. Grind these three ingredients into a fine powder, then boil with strong vinegar over a slow fire for half a day until it congeals into a paste. Remove the coagulated mercury, then take an iron pan, pound fresh ginger to extract its natural juice, and boil the mercury for another half day. Once dry, place the sulfur over a gentle and strong fire to melt it into liquid. Remove from the fire, pour into the coagulated mercury, and stir slowly with an iron spoon until it forms a blue-gold head. Next, grind finely with a willow wood mallet, then stir-fry over a slow fire, ensuring no ghostly flames arise. Continuously sprinkle with a willow branch dipped in sour vinegar for seven *shi* (twelve-hour periods) before stopping. For example, begin stir-frying at the *yin* hour and alternate workers until the *shen* hour. Once the cinnabar granules are mature, place them in a water-and-fire vessel for forging. At this time, it is crucial to eliminate any stray mercury to obtain firm and solid divine cinnabar.

A poem says:
Two eights unite yin and yang,
The noble man examines them in detail.

The harmonious blending transforms myriad changes,
The old woman weds Liu Lang.

**Method for Forging the Ding-Crucible**
The crucible should be fourteen inches deep, with three mountains protruding externally. The water basin at the bottom must not be too thick—only about one grain of rice in thickness is standard.

**Method for Constructing the Furnace**
Use wide bricks to first build a base one foot high, then apply a layer of clay on top, with height and width adjusted as needed. The third tier should be approximately three feet high. At the base, create a wind gate measuring one foot six inches in both length and width. The lowest tier of the furnace holds the iron crucible. The two tiers above are where the fire is applied. Leave one foot of empty space at the bottom. On the left, make a square door; on the right, a round door—these correspond to the sun and moon. The doors should be eight inches wide, aligning with the *mao* and *you* hours of the second eight. The main passage is built with two doors on the left and right, for winds are stronger from the east and west and weaker from the south and north.

**Method for Loading Refined Cinnabar into the Crucible**
Take the previously stir-fried cinnabar with the blue-gold head, grind it two to three thousand turns, then place it into the crucible. Mix red halloysite with sour vinegar and apply it to the three mountains of the crucible. Next, place the water basin of the crucible below, uniting heaven and earth, and seal the seams securely. After one night, place it into the furnace’s basin, then into the water furnace, adding water and fire. Ensure the water does not overflow, and the fire should not be too high. Initially, apply three *jin* of fire. When the water reduces by one or two shallow measures, add hot water. Then apply one to two more *jin* of fire, and when the water reduces by about three shallow measures, continuously replenish it until five *shi* (twelve-hour periods) have passed. Next, increase the fire to five *jin* and forge once. When the fire reaches fifteen *jin* and is fully applied, cease forging. Remove from the cold furnace and proceed with the subsequent methods.

Generally, if the refined cinnabar is not firm and solid, or if stray mercury remains, it will not become a treasure. If the nurturing is not continuous, the cinnabar’s color will not stabilize, and the cinnabar will "swallow its mother." All these flaws arise from the blue-gold head not being sufficiently stir-fried. If sulfur is not properly controlled, mercury will not form. If mercury is not coagulated, the work will not succeed. If the water and fire are too intense, the fire’s power is insufficient, or the thickness of the crucible’s bottom is unknown, all will fail. The water-and-fire crucible must be made of iron to avoid the risk of damage.

Lord Laozi said: "The primal essence of *jia* and *geng* is called blue-gold. When placed in the furnace and crucible, if fifteen *jin* of fire are used, and the *jiji* (water-fire balance) is maintained for one *fu* (twelve-hour period), heaven and earth will be fully united, and refined cinnabar will form. It must be firm and solid—this is the way. The fifteen *jin* of fire correspond to nine hundred years, fifteen cycles of the great yang, and the number of the *jiazi* cycle. In one day and night, there is the transformation of nine hundred years, and mercury becomes cinnabar. Within it lies the union of *li* (fire) and *kan* (water). The innate red color of mercury belongs to yang. Thus it is said: When *kan* and *li* unite, the *jiji* refining is complete. Water, fire, metal, and earth merge into one transformation. This distinction is made to reveal the true Dao."

A poem says:
Five *jin* of *jiji* in the palace of *kan* and *li*,
The work of unity is complete, the body firm and red.
Within, observe the power of yin and yang’s union,
Ninety days of *jiazi* complete one cycle.
When forging, the great fire’s spirit penetrates,
Stored for a thousand years, it does not decay.
If consumed, longevity and extended life are attained,
Knowing one method, all things become clear.

**Recipe for Boiling Refined Cinnabar**
Take the refined cinnabar forged in the crucible, cut it into pieces the size of pearls with a knife, and place them in a bamboo basket. Suspend it in a solution of mulberry ash and boil for three days and nights—use a new iron pot. Add the following ingredients:

- One *liang* of alum
- One *liang* of Sichuan pepper (remove the seeds)
- One *liang* of refined salt
- Two *qian* of chalcanthite
- Two *qian* of realgar

Grind the above five ingredients in order, add strong vinegar, and boil the refined cinnabar for three days and nights—longer is even better. Bathe in Sichuan pepper decoction, remove the medicinal residue, and dry thoroughly before use.

Lord Laozi said: "Why boil it? Because the sulfur and mercury must be rendered inert. Only then is boiling applied. These five numinous medicines correspond to the true five phases—this is the medicine that renders sulfur and mercury inert, hence called the five numinous ones. Boiling with mulberry ash controls sulfur. When sulfur is inert, mercury dies. Thus, by rendering sulfur inert, mercury can then be rendered inert. Once inert, what use is sulfur? Yet sulfur can be made and refined, possessing this great merit."

A poem says:
Yin and yang restrain each other to form gold,
Relying entirely on the mulberry lord to aid the poor.
Refined through nine works, it gains transformative power,
All by the cinnabar’s virtue, one meets the immortal lords.

**Method for Making the Receptacle**
Take one *jin* of *shanze* (mountain and marsh) ore, boil it into a liquid, add powdered lotus leaves, and stir. Remove from the fire and stir until it forms fine beads, then pour into water. Wash away the ash and sift to collect the finest original grains. If larger grains are used, the receptacle will not be numinous. Grains the size of millet should allow for breath—this also depends on a good "mother." If the mother is not good, the work will be difficult to complete.

A poem says:
When child and mother are truly numinous, they commune with transformation,
If the child is numinous but does not bond with the mother,
The great medicine, once made, must be cherished,
Lest one wander lost paths and suffer hardship.

Use four *liang* of mother to nurture one *liang* of child as the standard. The refined cinnabar must be separated by a "body-adhering medicine," layered within the receptacle, ensuring full coverage. Seal the opening, place it in an ash pit, and apply fire to nurture it, allowing it to receive numinous *qi*.

**Body-Adhering Medicine**
- Four *qian* of transparent flake chalcanthite, ground
- One *qian* of foreign sulfur, ground, boiled in water-field grass juice for seven *fu*

Stir-fry the two ingredients in a new pan until the color turns purple, then stop. Once cool, grind into a fine powder. Mix the refined cinnabar with strong vinegar until moistened, then roll it in the medicinal powder until fully coated. Next, wrap each piece tightly with silver foil and place it into the receptacle using the lotus-layering method.

Lord Laozi said: "Why use minerals like sulfur and chalcanthite as the body-adhering medicine? These two medicines are the root origin of rendering mercury inert. Mercury, upon seeing chalcanthite, can become powder; upon seeing sulfur, it can become cinnabar. Thus, both are used without losing their principle."

A poem says:
When Metal and Wood intermingle in the Fire Palace,
One must seek the *mao-you* hours to harmonize their union.
After seven cycles beyond the Heartless Maiden’s realm,
Invite Master Liu to ascend the azure void.

**Method for Nurturing in the Ash Pool and Fire Timing**
Once placed in the receptacle and sealed, bury the vessel in an ash pool filled with five *dou* of paper ash. Position the medicinal container at the center, supported by an iron tripod to elevate it. Cover the vessel, leaving a three-*cun* opening at the top. At the *mao* and *you* hours each day, add two *liang* of fresh fire through the opening, removing the old fire. Nurture it thus for one full day and night.

On the second day, increase the fire to four *liang*. Continue in this manner for three or four seven-day cycles until the process is complete. Once cooled, remove a single piece and test it: wrap it in the flesh of a long-aged white plum, steam for the duration of a meal, then quench it in strong vinegar. If the resulting color is snowy white and the piece feels light, the sulfur has departed, leaving only inert mercury, with no loss to the "mother."

If the transformation is incomplete and the adhering medicine still shows the color of chalcanthite, it indicates the fire was too high, not that the ash’s power was insufficient. Boil sour vinegar, add the "mother" powder to the receptacle, and mix in two *qian* of white alum. Rub it vigorously in the palm, wash clean, and dry. Return it to the vessel, add five *liang* of fire, and nurture it for three days at the *mao* and *you* hours, replenishing as before. Success will be assured.

The receptacle must be cast iron, weighing approximately five *jin*, and the fire should be matured fire.

Lord Laozi said: "Why use the *mao* and *you* hours to apply fire?"
He replied: "These are the gates of the sun and moon’s rising and setting, embodying the unbroken cycle of yin and yang. When water, fire, and earth are combined with the *mao* and *you* hours, the Five Phases are complete."

A poem says:
Without essence and radiance, the child lacks spirit;
Feeding on the mother’s flesh, the child paradoxically thrives.
If one fails to grasp the subtle mechanism and its essential point,
When will the ninefold work of creation be achieved?

Lord Laozi said: "Bathe the mother in vinegar and nurture it anew. For the mother, having been assailed by the qi of mercury, sulfur, and the adhering medicine, loses its luminous essence, becoming dull and obstructed, unable to effect transformation."

After nurturing the mother to produce the child three to five times, if any loss occurs, simply replenish it in a four-to-one ratio. If one has the means, the previously nurtured cinnabar may be combined with cinnabar from other mountains and marshes, refined anew according to the prior method, with fire added and replenished at the proper times. Nurture it for seven days, and the substance will become incomparably firm. If multiple cycles are performed, its power will be vast. Once twenty or more *liang* are gathered, bathe them twice—this is called "transcending the mundane to enter the sacred."

A poem says:
The fox and hare do not nurse the horse,
Nor do the hawk and crane hatch the sparrow’s eggs.
The Golden Elixir does not depart from lead,
Yet ultimately, it does not rely on lead’s foundation.

**First Cycle**
Remove the adhering medicine and residual sulfur, along with any that has been "stolen" (i.e., lost). Use this method to refine it, and nothing will be lost. When refining *lingsha* (spiritual cinnabar) to this stage, one gradually enters the sacred realm.

A poem says:
Break and refine it again to strengthen it,
Stealing away the mysterious essence, the body returns to its natural state.
Once the countenance is perfected,
The secret of immortality is passed down from mouth to mouth.

Use lead yet do not use lead;
One must work within lead.
But when it comes time to use lead,
Using lead is still a mistake.

Take the nurtured *lingsha*, pound it in an iron mortar, and wrap it in *kun* arrow paper to form a ball. Gather whole roots and leaves of *diding* (Chinese violet), *bima* (castor bean), and *badou* (croton) in equal parts, pound them into a paste, and coat the *lingsha* ball. Place it in a large sand vessel, surround it with silver foil, and pack *shengwuzhi* (a sacred substance) tightly around it. Drill twenty-three holes in the *lingsha* ball, position it at the center of the vessel, seal the mouth tightly, and place it in the furnace. Apply half a *cheng* of fire and nurture it overnight.

Remove and open the vessel: if a single piece remains at the center like a silver furnace, take it out and refine it. Crush it into pearls as before.

A poem says:
The Elixir Turtle completes seven returns and nine cycles,
The Mercury Furnace’s secrets must be clearly understood.
Once black and white can effect transformation,
Bathing in the Flowery Pond, one ascends of itself.

Bathe the *lingsha*, then boil it for a day in a pot with one *sheng* of strong vinegar, half a *liang* of green vitriol, and three *qian* of nitre. Ensure it becomes tightly compacted, transforming into a new and true treasure—this is the method for the first cycle’s work.

Good has no head, the cauldron has no ears;
No medicine is used, yet it is directly controlled.
Grasp the principle of Heaven and Earth,
And carefully consider this meaning.

**Method for the Second Cycle: Transmuting Lingsha into True Essence**
Take the *lingsha* that has been separated from its mother and bathed, and prepare one *jin* of receptacle. As before, place it in the vessel, using the two-to-eight ratio. Refine the *lingsha* as previously described, then apply the adhering medicine for the white-body *lingsha*:

- Three *qian* of *fenshuang* (calomel)
- Three *qian* of *liu* (sulfur)
- Four *qian* of *eguanshi* (stalactite)
- Four *qian* of *peng* (borax)
- Two *liang* of *baijiaoxiang* (white benzoin)

Grind these five ingredients into a fine powder, mix with sour vinegar to form the adhering medicine, then wrap the *lingsha* in two layers of *kunlun* paper, securing it tightly with hemp thread. Trim the excess, place it in the first-cycle silver receptacle using the lotus-layering method, seal the mouth tightly, and bury it in the ash pool. Apply and replenish the fire according to the prior method for a full seven days.

Once cooled and the vessel opened, the *lingsha* will appear in clusters like lychee, with the sulfur, mercury, and adhering medicine fused into a single white-body silver. There is no need to pass it through the lead pool. If four *liang* of the adhering medicine are gathered, it can be used to create a "Longevity Receptacle" for *mu sha* (mother cinnabar), which may then be employed as *lingsha*.

Lord Laozi said: "This removes the mundane embryo and sheds the mortal frame. The receptacle need not use sour vinegar, nor will the mother suffer any loss. It is called the Longevity Receptacle. Thus is the *lingsha* nurtured."

If sixteen *liang* are gathered, there is no further need for the furnace; one may proceed with the method for "seed gold" and "shell removal."

The white-body silver, when two *qian* are used to transmute one *liang* of red copper, yields the supreme treasure, called *Danyang*. No further boiling or refining with *an*-type furnaces is required.

A poem says:
No mundane medium forms the white-body,
Yet it awakens, freed from its womb’s qi.
My numinous power commands creation—
*Danyang* thus ascends in merit.

**Third Transformation: Seed Gold and Shell-Removal Method**
Simply take sixteen *liang* of green gold, add half a *qian* of *que*, half a *liang* of cinnabar, grind finely, then remove and wrap one *liang* in Kunlun paper to form a block, binding it tightly with hemp thread. Encase it in the juice of paper mulberry and *wu* donkey’s milk. This is the adhering medicine from the second transformation. Apply it to a thickness of one grain of rice, place it in the white-body silver sand receptacle, seal it with lotus-patterned mud, and close the seams as before. Set it in the ash pool, replenish and advance the fire as before, and nurture it for a full three days. Upon retrieval, the gold will naturally shed its shell. Remove the dead mercury pellets, crush them, and sow in the morning to reap by evening. One *liang* of the receptacle medicine can transmute one *liang* of silver into *geng*. One *qian* of the white-body silver can transmute one *liang* of red copper into the supreme treasure.

Lord Laozi said: "Why is it called the seed gold and shell-removal method? Because it employs green gold." A poem says:
The sulfur shell parts from its skin,
The green head peers forth in sunlight.
All directions transform and shift—
Drawing the sage to shatter mortal delusion.
Though the morning sowing is seen,
The workings of creation remain unseen.
If dogs and parrots were to consume it,
They would transform into phoenixes and dragon-children.

**Fourth Transformation: Morning Sowing and Evening Reaping with Pouring Method**
Simply take the nurtured, shell-removed dead green gold pellets, crush them with an iron hammer into pieces the size of *ying* seeds, weigh out half a *jin*, and place them in a sand receptacle. Each time, pour two *liang* of mercury over them, seal the seams at the *yin* hour, and set it in the ash pool. Add five *liang* of fire, then withdraw at the *shen* hour. By the next day, upon opening, the mercury will all be dead at the bottom of the receptacle. Pour mercury once daily—this is the method for endless longevity. If half a *jin* of dead mercury is accumulated, it can be transformed into *jade laughter* and *linlang*, with wondrous transmutations.

Lord Laozi said: "What is meant by morning sowing and evening reaping? It refers to subduing two *liang* of mercury with fire, pouring in the morning and completing by evening." He further said: "How does the medicine attain such potency? By combining herbal and mineral medicines, it naturally undergoes numinous transformation—hence it is called *lingsha*. Entry into sagehood is unknowable, thus it is said to be difficult at first but easy later. If ordinary people do not grasp this principle, how can they ever gain such insight?" One *qian* of the remaining receptacle medicine can transmute one *liang* of *he* into the supreme treasure. It possesses the power of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes.

A poem says:
Behold the merit accumulated to numinous might—
Base metals, once rebellious, now follow the true path.
Thus I transform the deviant to restore the right,
Abandoning gain and loss—truly a steadfast man.

**Fifth Transformation: Jade Laughter and Linlang Method**
Simply take five *liang* of the previously inverted green gold dead mercury, without any additional processing, place it in a receptacle, and sprinkle five *liang* of mercury over it. Set it at the bottom of an ash pool jar and advance five *liang* of fire. Each day at the *yin* and *mao* hours, replenish and advance the fire. Then use an iron tripod to elevate the medicine receptacle and nurture it with top-fire. Invert it every three days—the mercury will surge upward like *jade laughter* and *linlang*, resembling a forest of jade trees or pearl-tipped buds, faintly tinged with red, like coral. It is a true treasure to behold.

Lord Laozi said: "*Jade laughter* refers to mercury surging and coiling, congealing like a jade forest." One *qian* of the dead mercury can transmute one *liang* of *zheng* lead into the supreme treasure instantly. It possesses wondrous, numinous powers of transformation.

A poem says:

The mercury coils and congeals, intertwining of its own accord,
A solitary alchemy of divine power—how lofty the endeavor!
A hall filled with wintry snow, like *jade laughter*,
The Golden Lord, upon witnessing it, bows his divine brush.

**Sixth Transmutation: The Method for Conceiving the Five Metals, Subduing Yin-Yang, and Transmuting the False into the True**
Simply take one *liang* each of the Three Yellows, grind them, and refine for one *fu* period. Then add one *liang* of *jade laughter* powder, grind them together thoroughly, and place in a large crucible. Cover with half a *liang* of pre-refined *liu sha*, then sprinkle half a *qian* of *jade laughter* powder on top. Seal the opening and advance nine *jin* of fire, applying it in three stages until fully calcined. Cool the furnace, remove the medicine—it should appear cinnabar-red. Whether copper, iron, tin, or lead, melt five *liang* in the crucible, then add one *qian* of the Three Yellows powder. It will transmute into the supreme, purple-refined *zheng* metal.

**Method for Refining *Liu Sha* with Fire**
Take half a *liang* of *liu sha*, crush it, and place in a sand crucible. Sprinkle one *qian* of *tian qie* powder on top, seal the crucible, and wait for it to dry. Advance one *jin* of fire, calcine until glowing red, then remove with tongs and let cool. Grind into fine powder and store in a sand crucible for use.

Lord Laozi said: "Why are the Three Yellows called 'dead'? Because they transmute the false into the true. Mercury, being the essence of water, reverts to pure yang, thus it can restrain yang and transform the false into the true."

A poem says:
For love of the yellow sprout turning to white snow,
What difficulty could there be for me to ponder deeply?

The Three Primordials cherish and guard the crucible’s contents—
foolish men are not permitted to recklessly measure.

**Seventh Transmutation: Method for Congealing Mercury into Silver through Sevenfold Reversion of Sulfur**
Take eight *liang* of sulfur and two *liang* of mercury. Grind them together until black—this is the Dao of reversion and restraint. Next, add one *liang* of the previously refined Three Yellows, grind them together, and place in an amber crucible. Then, use three *liang* of Three Yellows powder to cover and seal it as prescribed. Place in an ash pit, adjust the fire daily at dawn and dusk, and advance four *liang* of fire. Nurture for seven full days. Remove and grind into powder. For each use, take one *zi* of the powder, place in a raw iron crucible, and sprinkle three *liang* of mercury over it. Apply civil and martial fire, nurture for three days, and wait for the mercury to die. Then advance three *jin* of fire, and with one firing, it will transmute into silver.

Lord Laozi said: "What is meant by the Sevenfold Reverted *Ling Sha*? Originally, eight *liang* of mercury were used, but here only two *liang* of mercury and eight *liang* of sulfur are employed—the meaning of reversion and repetition is the 'seven reversions,' which is the sevenfold transmutation."

A poem says:
The forked horns and the maiden’s form await their tryst,
Reversion and repetition, leisurely and fitting.

When the elixir matures, it undergoes wondrous inversion—mother and child unite without doubt. The eighth transmutation yields a white body that, when mixed with mercury, becomes *geng*, known as the *Eight Trigrams Geng Method*. Simply take five *liang* of the sevenfold reverted sulfur-mercury, add half a *liang* each of the finest three yellows, and one *liang* of southern borax. Grind them together until extremely fine, place in a crucible, seal the seams tightly, and set it in the ash pool. Nurture with two *liang* of fire, adjusting at dawn and dusk daily, for a full twenty-one days. Remove, grind into fine powder, and for each *qian* of the powder, mix with five *liang* of mercury to form true *geng*.

Lord Laozi said: "Why does mixing mercury yield *geng*? Because the number of the Eight Trigrams is complete, and the utmost balance of yin and yang is achieved."

A poem says:
Thus the elixir ripens in full display,
No effort spared in its toil.
A single spark of absolute yin transforms—
Who shall be my kindred soul?
If one can refine to this stage,
One shall instantly ascend in flight.

**Ninth Transmutation: The Great Method of the Immortal Elixir for Eternal Life and Ascension**
Simply take the previous *Ling Sha* elixir at each transmutation, refine it with honey into pills, and consume one pill with flowing water. Illness will be cured upon ingestion. The divine transformations of these transmutations have been described earlier—from ancient times to the present, no alchemical elixir surpasses this. The achievement of the ninth transmutation is beyond the reach of mere human effort.

Lord Laozi said: "If one can refine to this stage, a single touch can induce ascension, replacing mortal bones with those of a perfected being. Form and visage shall enter the realm of the wondrous and unfathomable. Choose a blessed highland, build an abode and altar, and prepare with fine azure silk. Daily, pay homage to the true, forge the furnace and cauldron, and use three *jin* of *Ling Sha* from the two-eight preparation, ground finely. Then take two *jin* of the eighth transmutation’s sulfur-mercury with the three yellows, combine for a total of five *jin*, and grind into dust. Place in the cauldron, calling it *Mingchuang Chen* (Dust of the Bright Window). This can be used to nurture the golden silkworm and achieve the wondrous Dao."

A poem says:
From mortal to sage, the sun and moon are probed,
Divine work rejoices in silent competence.
What are gold and jade, rank and wealth, compared to this?
The bright moon and clear breeze belong to my heart.

Lord Laozi said:
Take one *jin* each of yellow lead, malachite, mica powder, golden earth, and rock crystal. Grind these five ingredients into powder, refine with water, and mix with black donkey’s milk to coat the inner walls of the cauldron. Once dry, add the elixir, then seal the upper plate, uniting heaven and earth within the furnace. Adjust daily, nurturing with five *jin* of fire. After a full hundred days, remove and bury three *chi* underground for one year. Then suspend it in a well for another year, followed by soaking in water for a year. Retrieve and bury it underground again for one year to prevent the emanation of radiant light. Form the elixir into pills the size of a chicken’s head with sweet dew juice, then return them to the crucible to nurture with fire, adjusting for seven full days. Remove and feed one pill to a pure black dog, then cast it into a vat of freshly drawn water—the water shall boil intensely. Replace the water and soak again, repeating this with nine vats. The dog shall transform into a dragon and ascend. How much more so for a human who consumes it? After soaking in nine vats of water, one shall likewise ascend, hence the name *Ninefold Great Immortal Elixir*. Yet how can the common folk recklessly attempt such refinement? Even achieving a single transmutation allows one to consume the elixir and preserve health for extended years. No one who fails to follow heaven’s way can succeed in refining the great elixir. In the great elixir’s refinement, only three conditions ensure success:
First, innate impurities are purged, and wisdom naturally awakens.
Second, one seeks a master and the Dao, nurturing tranquility.
Third, the method aligns with the meeting of the green dragon, and actions become effortless, attracting the divine treasure’s radiance, which naturally guards and enlightens.

Of old, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning taught Lord Laozi to comprehend heaven and earth’s creation, refine water and fire into form, unify metal and wood, and universally harmonize the myriad transformations with the Dao. Thus, all creation was established, culminating in the secret method of the great elixir. It was then transmitted to the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who passed it to the Queen Mother of the West. Thereafter, immortals transmitted it orally, without written record, through heart-to-heart instruction thrice daily. Success was achieved in nine stages. Today’s *Scripture of Purity* expounds Lord Laozi’s intent in elixir refinement—medicine is without emotion, and the world calls it formless. Thus, he taught the people to establish the *yin* startle, embodying boundless transformation.

Moreover, a verse says:
Silent and natural, rooted in origin,
Rising and falling, advancing and retreating, paired and drawn.
If it enters the belly,
One ascends to the nine heavens.
Test one or two transmutations—effects shall be seen.
But at the third transmutation,
One must act without speech.
Alas, heaven and earth’s spirits will not tolerate carelessness—beware!

In elixir texts, when "nurturing in emptiness for five to seven days" is mentioned, it refers to opening and resealing after the initial firing if the elixir is not yet mature. Then, use the empty nurturing method: reseal, wait for dryness, place in the ash pool, and suspend half an inch of ash above. Cover with a single piece of ash, using no more than two *liang* of fire, and nurture gently for five to seven days—this is empty nurturing.

**Fire Regimen**
(Not for the previous nine transmutations, but for the ninefold method of refining arsenic powder into the elixir head.)
From the first to the fourth transmutation, apply fire twice daily, two *liang* each morning and evening. On the third day, add one *liang*, making three *liang*. From the third to the sixth day, increase by one *liang*, making four *liang*.

When the fire’s intensity reaches maturity, adjust accordingly. If the heat is excessive, proceed gradually—this is optimal; the height of the ash poses no hindrance. From the fifth to the seventh transmutation, follow the standard method. After seven days, replace with four *liang* of mature fire daily, ensuring no deficiency. Do not exceed five *liang* per day until reaching the seventyfold measure of the Great Medicine, at which point proceed gently without haste; thereafter, five *liang* suffices.

**Qingxia Zi’s Sixteenfold Great Elixir**

**Boiling Cinnabar (Section Jia)**
*Sulfur, green salt:* one *liang* each
*Gallnut:* break open, remove worm-eaten fragments, wipe clean with dry cloth (avoid fire), take one and a half *liang* of powder

Grind the three ingredients together in a mortar until even, place in a sand pot, and fill to eight-tenths with sour aged rice vinegar. Suspend three *liang* of cinnabar and boil for one *fu* period. Maintain a gentle simmer like fish eyes; replenish with hot vinegar as it reduces—avoid cold vinegar. Upon completion, wash with warm water to purify.

**Forming Chalcanthite-Cinnabar Coating (Section Yi)**
*Refined chalcanthite:* five *liang*
*White lead, mercury:* one *liang* each
*Crude nitre:* one *fen*

Grind the four ingredients together until fine, with no visible specks or sound. Place in a silk bag, suspend in a porcelain vessel, and boil in river water for one day. Use an iron spoon to stir within the vessel; when the mercury has transformed into cinnabar grains, cease. Discard the remaining solution, wash the grains clean, dry, and form into a single pellet. Place in a crucible, cover with a bowl, and apply gentle fire to expel all residual mercury. Grind finely, moisten with honey, and boil with cinnabar. Wrap the pellet evenly with a layer of the mixture to form a uniform coating.

**Mercury Seal (Section Bing)**
*Mercury:* seven *qian*
*Mother (mercury residue):* three *qian*
*Pepper:* three *qian*

Grind together finely, then gently heat in pepper-infused water until the mixture becomes mud-like—this is ideal. Wash away the residue with water, dry, and press between layers of paper to remove excess mercury before applying as a body seal.

For cinnabar applied to the body or heavy-head cinnabar grains, arrange the pieces loosely in a flatiron, cover with a bowl, and apply prolonged gentle fire to expel all residual mercury until the grains solidify into firm cinnabar.

**Enclosure (Section Ding)**
*Silver pearls:* five *liang*
Wrap the cinnabar from the mercury seal in yellow wrapping, place in a yellow crucible, and mix with two *liang* of yellow lead and the juice of yellow ox hide. Seal with refined clay, allow to dry, then fire intensely until red-hot for an extended period. Remove from heat, allow to cool, grind finely, and nurture with yellow powder, covering the top with one *liang*. Seal the opening, allow to dry, place in the furnace, and cover the top with two *cun* of ash.

**Fire Regimen (Section Wu)**
Apply three *liang* of top fire, replacing at *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours. Nurture for three *sui* periods, then cease the fire. Allow to cool, remove, and peel away the cinnabar-coated silver—the cinnabar must not melt. Use for subsequent washing and rinsing.

**Testing (Section Ji)**
Arrange the fire-tamed cinnabar in a yellow crucible (or an unglazed vessel). Pour two *liang* of mercury, seal the opening, place in the furnace, and apply four *liang* of top fire, replacing at *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours. Nurture for three *mou* periods. Upon opening, if no sprouts appear, add another two *liang* of mercury and repeat the process. If still no sprouts, add another two *liang* and repeat. Sprouts will inevitably form. Then, use twenty-four *liang* of mercury for further nurturing.

**Washing and Rinsing (Section Geng)**
Do not remove the cinnabar or yellow sprouts; instead, pour four *liang* of mercury. Place the water tripod securely, position the yellow crucible atop it, cover the top with two *cun* of ash, and apply four *liang* of top fire, replacing at *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours. Nurture for five *pan* periods, removing half the ash every two *pan* periods. Lift the yellow crucible, pour cold water (or hot water) into the water tripod until full. Open the yellow crucible, add another four *liang* of mercury, and repeat the process six times. Then collect the yellow sprouts, yielding perhaps one *jin*, ten *liang*, or half a *jin*. Accumulate these for the Great Elixir, nurturing with fire to stimulate the wellspring of transformation for the Sixteenfold Great Elixir. The remaining residue that does not ascend may be combined with the earlier cinnabar. Form into a grass-sealed vessel, and with one refinement, it becomes treasure.

**Hua Chi Xin (Transformative Pool Preparation):**
*Borax, sal ammoniac, saltpeter, alum, white numinous powder, and yellow sprouts—* each one *liang*. Weigh the ingredients in equal parts, grind with milk to a fine uniformity, and layer above and below with wheat-bran paste. Mix half a *sheng* of grain juice with one *sheng* of rice vinegar, stir evenly, and pour to moisten. Apply fire to reduce by half, then pour again, repeating until the liquid is exhausted. Cover with a *jian* bowl, apply gentle fire for one *shi* period until scorched, then move to a shaded place to cool. Wash thoroughly.

**Mu Yu Ren (Bathing Preparation):**
*Sichuan pepper, white lime, purple grass,* and *Stephania tetrandra*—or, in some versions, *Dioscorea bulbifera*—weigh in equal parts. Crush coarsely, decoct in a stone vessel with flowing water to a thick liquid, then strain through layered silk. Use this to wash the yellow sprouts from the *Hua Chi* until thoroughly cleansed, avoiding raw water. Place in a *jian* bowl, apply gentle fire to dry, stir, and expose to the open air for one night to absorb the harmonious darkness of heaven and earth—this is called *Jing Lu Huang Ya* (Dew-Refined Yellow Sprouts).

**Cao Gui Kui (Herbal Seal Preparation):**
*Sichuan pepper, anemarrhena, fritillaria, scrophularia, sophora, coptis, phellodendron, rhubarb, licorice, apricot kernel, arisaema, gentian, gallnut,* and *gardenia*—pound into powder, mix with rice vinegar to form a paste, and apply to cinnabar and mercury that failed to sprout. Roll into a ball about one finger’s thickness, wrap in *Kunlun* paper, seal with refined clay, and allow to dry. Patch any leaks in the crucible. Fire with five *jin* of fuel—or three *jin*—until glowing red, then quench in water. Pound into powder, mix with rice vinegar to form a paste, and apply again to cinnabar and mercury that failed to sprout. Roll into a ball of the same thickness, wrap in *Kunlun* paper, seal with refined clay, and dry. Patch crucible leaks. Fire with five *jin*—or three *jin*—until glowing red, quench in water, and extract the molten silver.

**Dan Tou (Elixir Foundation):**
Place *Jing Lu Huang Ya* into a yellow crucible, pour four *liang* of mercury, and apply once daily. Nurture with fire for two and a half days, using *upper fire and lower water*. For another two and a half days, use *upper water and lower fire*.

After nurturing for a full five days, the cycle of water and fire is complete. For instance, when fire is above and water below, ensure the water does not dry up. If water is above and fire below, use an iron tripod: place fire beneath the base and water atop the opening (A). This is the method for harmonizing water and fire.

On chamber days, apply fire. For the first two days, use two *liang* of fire. Each day, increase by one *liang*, gradually reaching sixteen days. Then reduce the fire incrementally back to one *liang*. This completes one month’s firing regimen.

After chamber days, apply one *liang* of fire and nurture for a month—this is the method of gradual progression, ensuring the mercury never depletes.

To invert the sprouts and halt their growth, observe the five-colored purple powder. When the lid is opened, it will rise and condense into purple powder. Sweep this into a silver container to gather the Great Elixir. The remaining sprouts are stored in the *shen shi* (Spirit Chamber).

Every fifteen days, perform a "bathing" ritual to activate the transformative process. As Master Bao Zhenjun said: *"Without the Flowery Pond, it will never be refined; even if powder forms, it will scatter lightly. Only after firing will you truly understand."* Thus, the immortals guarded this secret, never revealing the firing regimen—it is the hidden art of the Golden Elixir’s transformations. Once mastered, success is assured.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Waxing and waning, ebb and flow—such is the creation of Heaven and Earth."* As the *Cantong Qi* says: *"Within lies the gushing spring; the firing regimen nurtures the five colors into purple. Enter the Purple River Chariot’s system, and the gushing spring is cultivated."*

Each day, apply the elixir. When the lid is suddenly opened, sprouts may appear inside the container—some jade-green, some tea-colored, some purple-red, some with a white radiance—these are their natural hues. If the container is filled with yellow earth or gold, these are the true five colors. After one or two applications, transfer them to a crucible to collect the purple powder, confirming the five colors.

At this stage of refinement, the purple powder from the opened container is called *"Mingchuang Chen"* (Dust of the Bright Window)—the foundation of the Great Elixir. Upon seeing the five colors, take one or two *liang* of silver foil, hammer it thin at the edges and even thinner at the center, then embed it atop the sand container. Next, place *Huang Ya* (Yellow Sprout) inside, seal it, and apply the same firing regimen. Naturally, the powder will ascend and adhere to the foil atop the container. Every five days, open the container and sweep the powder with a goose feather into a silver vessel, collecting one, two, or four *liang*. Store it in the *shen shi* (Spirit Chamber) for further transformation. It will spontaneously ascend in spirit, coalescing into a substance of unrefined cinnabar and mercury—the essence of cinnabar and mercury.

**Method for Transforming Purple Powder into the Great Elixir in the Spirit Chamber:**
Take three parts *Geng Sha* (cinnabar), press out the free mercury, leaving exactly one *liang*. Divide this into three pills, then boil them for a day in *bing yao* (cake medicine)—or charcoal ash infusion—along with dew water until firm. Place them in a container, cover with four *liang* of purple powder, and set it in an ash jar. Apply balanced fire atop with one *liang* of fire, nurturing it during the *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours for seven cycles. It will melt into *Zimo Jin* (Purple-Ground Gold), with no loss in weight—proof of the powder’s efficacy.

The *shen shi* (Spirit Chamber) is a silver container, which must first be sealed with a sand container before placing it in the ash jar. Nurture it with one *liang* of balanced fire. If no further transformation is needed, grind it finely, mix with paper mulberry juice to form pills, and let dry. Coat them in yellow wax, then submerge in flowing water or a well for forty-nine days. Retrieve them, and take one pill with well-bloom water to ward off all malevolent influences, turning the five viscera golden—thus achieving the state of an Earth Immortal.

The Way of Transformation is too profound to describe fully.

**If the Mingchuang Chen (Dust of the Bright Window) is not yet ready for consumption, proceed with further refinement to nurture the Golden Elixir:**

**First Transformation: Refining Huang Ya into White Snow and Golden Essence**
Master Zihua said: Crush *Huang Ya* (Yellow Sprout), levigate it with water, and nurture in a crucible whatever follows the water. It will transform into the Great Medicine, with the same advancing and retreating fire regimen. Whatever does not follow the water can be melted with white gold to instantly form a treasure. What follows the water is called *Huang Ya Jin Jing* (Golden Essence of the Yellow Sprout).

**Second Transformation: Adding Mercury to Huang Ya to Produce Medicine**
Take five *liang* of *Huang Ya*, place it in the *Hua Chi* (Flowery Pond), and add five *liang* of mercury. Set it over fire to form cinnabar grains. Return it to the crucible, seal with paper, place in the furnace, and nurture with balanced fire for one *fu* (a period of time). Remove it, add five *liang* of mercury, seal, and apply the same firing regimen to produce a treasure.

**Third Transformation: Verifying and Using Huang Ya to Complete the Medicine**
Take half a *jin* each of *Huang Ya*, silver powder, and mercury, place them together in the *Hua Chi*, and temper fifty times. Remove, place in a container, seal, and apply the same firing regimen. Upon removal, one firing will produce a treasure. Every five days, apply the elixir, harvesting and refining until the mercury is inexhaustible—this is called the *Yongquan* (Gushing Spring).

**Fourth Transformation: Refining Mingchuang Chen into the Original Source of Vermilion Mercury**
Take one *liang* of *Mingchuang Chen*, place it in a crucible, then add one *liang* of coarse cinnabar. Cover above and below with *Mingchuang Chen*, then pour one *liang* of mercury over it. Seal as before, place in the furnace, and nurture with fire for forty-nine days to form a treasure. Alternatively, melt it for seven days to instantly produce gold. What ascends to the top of the crucible is called *Zihe Che* (Purple River Chariot).

**Fifth Transformation: Refining Mingchuang Chen into the Two Blacks**
Grind one *liang* each of sulfur and mercury finely, place them in a crucible, then cover with two *liang* of *Mingchuang Chen*. Seal as before, place in the furnace, and nurture with fire for five days until it turns golden or purple. Remove, grind finely, then mix with five *liang* of raw sulfur and paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of mung beans. Use one pill per *liang* of mercury to transmute it into gold.

**Sixth Transformation: Refining Mingchuang Chen into the Purple River Chariot**
Take five *liang* of *Mingchuang Chen* and place it in the *shen shi*—the *Taiyi Shen Shi* (Chamber of the Great One).

**Sixth Transformation: Refining Mercury into the Purple River Chariot**
Take five *liang* of mercury, prepare it in the manner of the *Zai Lian* method, place it within *Mingchuang Chen*, seal as before, and nurture with fire in the furnace for seven days until it forms *Huangya* (Yellow Sprout). When melted, it becomes true gold, and what ascends to the top is called *Zihe Che* (Purple River Chariot).

**Seventh Transformation: Transmuting the Purple River Chariot into Gold Liquid**
Take five *liang* of *Zihe Che*, mix with vinegar to form a paste, spread it within the vessel, bore holes, and allow to dry. Place five *liang* of mercury inside, seal as before, and nurture for seven days until it forms *Geng* (Metal Essence).

**Eighth Transformation: Transmuting the Purple River Chariot into Huangju**
Take five *liang* of *Zihe Che* and one *liang* of cinnabar, grind finely into powder, place in the *shen shi*, seal as before, and nurture with fire for forty-nine days. Remove, grind finely, and mix with paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of sesame seeds. Take one pill on an empty stomach with ash-free wine.
This elixir revives the dead and restores life, reanimates the body and revives the soul. After consuming ten pills, the *Three Corpses* depart the body. In cases of sudden death, administer half a *qian* of the elixir mixed with cold water, and the person will revive immediately. Such rebirth is no ordinary feat—how could it be achieved without divine power?

**Ninth Transformation: Refining Huangju with Xiong to Alter Substance**
Take one *liang* each of *Huangju*, cinnabar, and mercury, and four *liang* of *xiong* (realgar), grind finely, place in the *shen shi*, seal, and nurture for seven days. Remove, grind finely, and mix with jujube pulp to form pills the size of mung beans. Take one pill on an empty stomach with well-water drawn at dawn. For those suffering from *yang* depletion, blackened complexion, or mental confusion, this elixir restores youth, revives the soul, and raises the dead. Its divine efficacy is unfathomable.

**Tenth Transformation: Transmuting Iron into Gold with Xionghuang**
Place *xionghuang* in the crucible, cover with one *liang* of *Huangju* powder, seal, and nurture with fire as before for one hundred days. One pill may transmute one *liang* of iron into gold.

**Eleventh Transformation: Refining Mercury into Treasure with Zihe Che Powder**
Take one *liang* each of *Huangju* and *Huangya*, and four *liang* of cinnabar, spread them in the *shen shi*, seal, and nurture in the furnace for thirty days. Remove and use only the cinnabar, mixing it with paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of mung beans. One pill transmutes one *liang* of copper into *Huangu Dan Yang* (Bone-Transforming Yang Elixir). When sprinkled over one *liang* of mercury, it instantly becomes treasure.
One *liang* of this copper medicine may transmute one *jin* of mercury, or one *liang* into ten *liang*.

**Twelfth Transformation: Refining Huangju into the Purple Gold Elixir**
Take two *liang* of *fen shuang* (calomel), grind finely, and mix with glue to form pills the size of mung beans. Use one *liang* of *Huangju* powder to evenly cover above and below, seal as before, and nurture with fire for fourteen days. Remove. One pill, when sprinkled over one *liang* of mercury, transmutes it into treasure.
Alternatively, it may be accomplished in a single night.

**Thirteenth Transformation: Refining Purple River Chariot to Transmute the Five Metals**
Take five *liang* of *Ziheche* (Purple River Chariot), place it in the divine chamber, seal as before, and nurture with fire in the furnace for one year. The fire’s power is equal to that of the Great Elixir. Form pills with paper mulberry juice, the size of soybeans. Each pill may transmute the five metals into treasure.

**Fourteenth Transformation: Divine Alchemy of the Purple Gold Elixir**
Take *Ziheche* powder, place it in the divine chamber, seal tightly, and nurture with fire in the furnace for one year. Remove. Form pills with paper mulberry juice, the size of sesame seeds, then return them to the divine chamber, seal tightly, and nurture with fire for forty-nine days. Remove. Wrap them and place in east-flowing water. Soak for forty-nine days, then take one pill with wine free of sediment.

**Fifteenth Transformation: Verification of the River Chariot**
Take four *liang* or half a *jin* of *Ziheche*, place it in the crucible. Then cover evenly with *Huangju*, seal tightly, and nurture with fire in the furnace for a full year. Open the crucible to reveal five kinds of elixirs, then gather them. Return them to the crucible and nurture with fire for seven days before consuming the elixirs. These five are named as follows: first, *Longhu* (Dragon-Tiger); second, *Shenfu* (Divine Talisman); third, *Ziyou* (Purple Wanderer); fourth, *Zijin Dan* (Purple Gold Elixir); fifth, *Jinye Xiaohuan Dan* (Golden Liquid Lesser Return Elixir).

**Sixteenth Transformation: Differentiating the Five Elixirs**
After nurturing with fire in stages for one year, once all elixirs are complete, fast and bathe in purification, offer libations to heaven and earth, then open the crucible to retrieve the elixirs. That which congeals atop the crucible in a true crimson hue is called *Longhu Dan* (Dragon-Tiger Elixir). Consuming it allows one to ascend in broad daylight, wander the Purple Palace in spirit, transforms chicken feed into phoenixes, and turns dog food into dragons. That which forms within the crucible in flakes like fish scales with a white radiance is called *Shenfu Dan* (Divine Talisman Elixir). Consuming it revives the dead, restoring withered bones to life. That which appears pale red like the color of lotus blossoms is called *Ziyou Dan* (Purple Wanderer Elixir), or if it remains purple without changing through various hues, it is called *Zijin Dan* (Purple Gold Elixir). That which forms with a golden radiance along all edges is called *Jinye Xiaohuan Dan* (Golden Liquid Lesser Return Elixir). For all the above elixirs, form pills with paper mulberry juice, the size of sesame seeds. Once dry, wrap them in silk and soak in east-flowing water for one hundred days. Remove. Take one pill with well-flower water, then two, then three, up to four pills, to complete the dosage. With focused intent and utmost care, one will swiftly attain spiritual communion. Consuming a single pill transforms the five viscera and bone marrow into golden hues. One becomes impervious to water or fire, while tigers, wolves, snakes, and insects all flee in terror. All malevolent spirits and demons keep their distance, and through spiritual transfiguration, one ascends in broad daylight—this is the supreme and most wondrous Dao of the perfected.

*Geng Dao Ji*, Scroll Eight, concludes. #1 (Text following this point appears to be missing.)

**Geng Dao Ji, Scroll Nine**

**Western Shu Jade Cauldron Perfected One’s Nine-Cycle Great Elixir**
**First Cycle**
Take ten taels of fine cinnabar. Chop red peony root and steep it in sour rice vinegar, then boil the cinnabar for five *fu*-periods. Mix with powdered straw and honey to bind—do not overmoisten—layering and covering the cinnabar as it cooks. Seal the vessel and nurture with fire for a full seven days. Cool the furnace, remove the cinnabar, and discard the straw ash. Next, boil *qianghua* in sour vinegar for three *fu*-periods until it is subdued by fire. If it remains unyielding to the flame, prepare a receptacle for nurturing the cinnabar. Should any vapor arise, take ten taels of *shanze gen*, pound it into pearls, and layer it with the cinnabar. Seal the vessel, press salt over the lid, and bury it in an ash pit. Nurture for seven days, and the cinnabar will truly die and become treasure.

**Second Cycle**
Use the cinnabar nurtured in the previous receptacle. Boil five taels of cinnabar with the same herbs until dry, then grind it finely with three *qian* of water-borne gold powder. Knead with pure rock honey into a single cake, bind tightly with silk, and wrap in three taels of silver foil, ensuring complete tightness. Place it in the previous receptacle and nurture for seven days. Upon removal, if the cinnabar retains its unborn hue, it is ready for further refinement into the great medicine. If used in a pearl furnace, it will reveal its treasure; when applied to *danyang*, it transforms bone into supreme treasure. When poured, it sprouts buds—this water-borne gold is the mother of silver.

**Third Cycle**
Use the cinnabar nurtured in the first cycle as the receptacle. Forge a small vessel from *shanze gen* to serve as the divine chamber, leaving fine holes on all sides. Place the previous receptacle’s mother cinnabar inside the vessel. For the outer receptacle, use the cinnabar from the first cycle. Inside the vessel, add two taels of cinnabar and mercury, bury the vessel at the center of the receptacle, and nurture for seven days. Upon opening, if no mercury vapor remains and it has congealed, pour in another two taels and nurture for another seven days. The mercury will sprout buds; remove them without disturbing the vessel. Pour in another two taels of cinnabar and mercury, nurture again, and accumulate over ten taels of buds. Then bathe them.

**Bathing Method (Flower Pool):**
Grind equal parts borax, saltpeter, *pao*, green salt, and alum into powder. Line the bottom of a bamboo basket, place the buds on the powder, and cover with more powder. Mix one bowl of paper mulberry juice with one *sheng* of rice vinegar, pour over the medicine, and cover with a small dish. Simmer over low heat until dry, then seal the dish’s seams and slightly increase the fire. Nurture for about one hour, then cool before opening to complete the bath.

**Bathing Method (Herbal Wash):**
Grind one tael each of purple grass, *huangyaozi*, *hanfangji*, and *baiyou* into powder. Boil in three bowls of water to make a thick decoction, strain, and simmer the buds in the liquid for several rolls. Wash and purify them, then place in the basket. Dry over low heat and expose to the open air overnight.

**Fourth Cycle**
Crush the bathed buds to form a receptacle. Place the previous silver vessel inside, pour in five taels of cinnabar and mercury, and nurture for three days. Upon removal, the mercury will have congealed. Open the vessel, add another three taels of cinnabar and mercury, seal, and nurture for another three days. The mercury will sprout a white jade smile. Accumulate over ten taels of poured mercury to form the receptacle—this white bud smile is the raw material of supreme treasure.

**Fifth Cycle**
Use the bud sieve as the receptacle. Grind two taels of realgar and two taels of cinnabar and mercury into powder, place in the previous divine chamber, and nurture for three days. Add one tael of mercury each time, increasing to ten taels over twenty-eight days. Grind and nurture repeatedly, without counting days, until it gradually transforms into light dust. This substance cannot be drowned by water nor burned by fire. At high noon, cast a small amount into the blue sky—it will dissolve into white snow, ascending beyond measure. Accumulate this to form the receptacle.

**Sixth Cycle**
Use the dust from a bright window as the receptacle. Grind four taels of gold with half a *jin* of cinnabar and mercury, place in the divine chamber, and nurture for forty-nine days. Upon removal, it will all become gold powder.

**Seventh Cycle**
Use the gold powder as the receptacle. Grind four taels of cinnabar with half a *jin* of cinnabar and mercury, place in the previous divine chamber, and nurture for a full forty-nine days. The cinnabar and mercury will entirely transform into purple gold powder.

**Eighth Cycle**
Use the nurtured purple gold powder as the receptacle. Grind eight taels of cinnabar and mercury with four taels of realgar, place in the divine chamber, and nurture for a full forty-nine days. It will all become purple-ground gold powder. Mix with paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of sesame seeds. Each two pills can transmute one *jin* of mercury into purple-ground refined gold.

**Ninth Cycle**
Use the previous receptacle’s purple gold returning elixir. Melt one *jin* of raw iron into liquid, add one pill of the elixir, and it will resonate in the crucible, transforming entirely into purple gold. From beginning to end, mercury must be extracted from cinnabar, and realgar must be refined to its essence. For the fire timing, use two taels of mature fire at *mao* and *you*, with the fire’s separation and union maintained at roughly three *cun* from the top fire.

**Ge Immortal’s Nine-Cycle Spirit Sand Great Elixir**
**First Cycle**
Take eight taels of mercury and two taels of sulfur. Stir-fry until the sulfur’s head turns green, then place in a water-and-fire crucible to refine and ascend. Cut into blocks for use. Boil with saltpeter, *liu*, green-black alum, *huangyaozi*, thunder pill, *langdu*, *mulu*, *nanxing*, and *wujia* bark in rice vinegar for three days and nights. Bathe thoroughly, then boil in aged leaf juice for two days. Place in the mother cinnabar receptacle and nurture with fire until the color turns pure white—only then can it serve as the sacred receptacle. If not yet white, nurture for another seven-day cycle until it truly dies.

**Second Cycle**
Grind sixteen taels of truly dead spirit sand into powder, and mix with four taels of raw spirit sand. Use *jianhuang*, *yadan* alum, green spirit, white snow, and flying talismans affixed to the body. Blend with honey, coat each piece evenly, then roll in spirit sand powder. Nurture for seven days, then apply a great fire in one firing to complete the treasure.

**Third Cycle**
Take the spirit sand from the second cycle, without firing, and use it to infuse *danyang*. Each two *qian* can infuse one tael of red matter until it turns purely white. Pour into the trough, cover with damp paper—it will turn snow-white, this being the method to test the *gen* of spirit sand. If proceeding to later cycles, this step is omitted.

**Fourth Cycle**
Use only the head of the spirit sand receptacle to nurture the mother sand, following the previous method to refine spirit sand; it likewise becomes treasure after seven days.

**Fifth Cycle**
Take sixteen taels of spirit sand from the second cycle to form a receptacle, nurture four taels of cinnabar within, wrapping each piece in gold leaf. Nurture for three seven-day periods, then remove. Use one tael each of salt essence and chalcanthite, half a tael of *liuxu* alum, and a large bowl of medicinal paste. Boil the previous ingredients until dry, then place together in a crucible. In another crucible, take one tael of nurtured cinnabar and one tael of *geng* to form a liquid. Then place the previous crucible into the furnace to melt, using tongs to extract the cinnabar-*geng* liquid and pour it into the medicinal crucible. Once clarified, pour into the trough to form treasure—yielding two taels of fine, superior *geng*.

**Sixth Cycle**
Take the cinnabar nurtured within the spirit sand receptacle, free of smoke, and blend evenly with two taels each of male and female [ingredients]. Place in a sealed vessel and nurture with fire for forty-nine days, then remove. Form into pills with yellow wax, the size of a chicken’s head. Each pill can infuse one tael of *gen* from mountains and marshes into *geng*.

**Seventh Cycle**
Take sixteen taels of spirit sand nurtured within the truly dead spirit receptacle to form a receptacle, pour four taels of mercury over it, and nurture for seven days—upon opening, it has already become supreme treasure. Wait until sprouts fill the vessel before harvesting, then fire to form treasure. With prolonged nurturing, it becomes a cold forest of jade trees.

**Eighth Cycle**
Take twenty-four taels of cold forest powder and twelve taels of previously nurtured cinnabar, grind evenly with one *jin* of raw sulfur, place in a sealed vessel, and nurture for seven days before removing. Pour four taels of mercury over it, nurture with fire for three seven-day periods—its sprouts will all turn yellow. Fire to form *geng*.

**Ninth Cycle**
In preparing the medicine, choose an auspicious day. Take the spirit sand from the eighth cycle to form a sealed vessel, with a fire regimen of one tael per day. Two taels on the second day. Three taels on the third day.

Continue the fifteenth day, then remove. Use a cold furnace, bathe for sixteen days, and store one tael. On the first day of the next month, resume nurturing—after three years, the Great Elixir will be complete. Once the elixir is formed, dried mercury becomes a golden figure. If consumed, one ascends in flight. Mix one pearl with honey and take with frankincense decoction; even chickens and dogs that ingest it instantly transform into dragons and phoenixes.

**Secret Method of Precious Niter by Immortal Ge**
Take niter in any quantity, boil it with rehmannia juice and oilseed rape juice, then place it inside a phoenix embryo. Use Kunlun paper pasted to a thickness of one grain of rice, cover the embryo shell with talcum powder, then seal the top with several sheets of mica. Cover with white tiger, seal tightly, and calcine with one *cheng* of fire until it turns five colors with patterns—marvelous beyond words. This niter serves as a crucible to nurture spirit sand and cinnabar powder into treasure, even more wondrous than other crucibles. It is called the **Crucible of Grand Yang** or the **Crucible of Pure Yang**.

**Method for Parting the Embryo to Reveal Treasure**
Take eight taels of fire-tamed niter, crush and grind into coarse powder, place in a crucible to nurture various mineral medicines. For two taels of cinnabar, wrap it in silver foil, then cover with one layer of Kunlun paper, place in the crucible, and nurture with half a *jin* of *mao-you* fire for three days—it will truly die, its color unchanged, the silver foil unbroken, allowing it to be mixed with mercury to form treasure. For two taels of realgar, wrap it in *geng* foil, place in the crucible as before, nurture with six taels of fire for five days—it will truly die, its color unchanged, and can transmute silver into ten-tenths *geng*. For two taels of orpiment, nurture with fire as before to transmute silver into *geng*. For two taels of seven-tenths yang candidate, first wrap it in Kunlun paper, then coat with stone-center yellow mixed with rice vinegar, dry in shade overnight, place in the crucible the next day, nurture with six taels of fire for three days—it will truly die, its color like cinnabar, with a radiant red flame, dazzling to behold. Black sand and grass sand do not retreat from the furnace. For two taels of powdery frost, wrap it in silver foil, then cover with one layer of Kunlun paper, place in the crucible, nurture with four taels of fire for three days—it will truly die, becoming even harder, the silver foil unbroken, able to transmute red stubborn metal into white, with a thousand transformations. For two taels of arsenic, wrap it in one or two layers of Kunlun paper, place in the crucible—nurture with fire for one day and it will die, its embryonic color unchanged, and can transmute copper. For two taels of chalcanthite, wrap it in gold foil as before, then cover with Kunlun paper, nurture with six taels of fire for three days—it will naturally truly die, its color like red gold, able to transmute silver into eight-tenths *geng*. For borax, niter, and alum, wrap them in foil and nurture to death, using only one layer of Kunlun paper, place in the crucible, nurture with fire for five days as appropriate—they will naturally truly die, their embryonic color unchanged.

**Nine Cycles and Sixteen Transformations of Spirit Sand Great Elixir**

**First Cycle**
Take half a *jin* of imported sulfur, shape into lumps, and boil with half a *jin* each of *ma-ti* fragrance and *hu-er* grass in two *dou* of river water for seven *fu* periods.

**Ninth Cycle**
Take the previously completed sand, melt one *jin* of fine silver into beads, nurture the sand within, place in a sealed vessel, set in an ash pool, and fire with three taels of fire for seven days. Remove and bathe. Then use this sand to nurture new sand into treasure—its transformations are boundless. Strike a crane’s crown with one grain of the elixir, and even a skilled archer will miss it for days, hence it is called spirit sand. In healing, it is as swift as the wind sweeping away floating clouds, with the wondrous power to revive the dead, restore youth, and reverse aging—its efficacy cannot be fully described.

**First Transformation**
Take one *jin* of mercury, mix with three taels each of green vitriol, chalcanthite, and white alum, two taels each of green *guan* and white *guan*, and one tael of niter, grind together, boil in one *dou* of rice vinegar for three days, then bathe clean. Boil imported sulfur with *ma-ti* fragrance and *yu-xing* grass for three days, melt two taels of sulfur in an iron pan, add eight taels of mercury, stir-fry into sand, place in the crucible, and fire with five *jin* of fire for one day.

**Second Transformation**
Fire with two *jin* for one day. Fire with half a *jin* for one day. Remove and form into blocks, boil in pine-yellow ash liquid for one *fu* period. Wash clean, then coat with honey and apply silver foil to the surface. Place in the former silver-pearl chamber and nurture for seven days. On the first day, two taels of fire. From the second to the fourth day, three taels. From the fifth to the seventh day, four taels of fire to completion.

**Third Transformation**
Take the former nine-cycle Great Elixir Mother and break into small pieces. First place half into the vessel, then spread the newly nurtured sand within, and cover with the remaining half of the Elixir Mother. Seal firmly in the ash pool and nurture for seven days. First two taels, then three, then four, then five taels to completion. Remove. Nurture the sand in this manner seven times to obtain fourteen taels of Elixir Head. Store each separately, then boil with *chao-sheng* grass for one day.

**Fourth Transformation**
Use the newly nurtured sand from the third cycle. Pound to powder in an iron mortar, wrap in a layer of Kunlun paper, then coat the sand with a paste made from *di-ding* flower, croton seeds, and castor beans. Place in the vessel, seal tightly, and set in the furnace. Fire with half a *cheng* for one night. Cool and remove—a piece like jade. This is the supreme treasure. Crush again to form a chamber.

**Fourth Transformation**
Take the previously fired jade-like sand pieces and form them into lumps. Grind *fen-shuang* (powdered frost), *liu-sha* (sal ammoniac), and *peng-sha* (borax) into equal parts of powder. Roll the sand lumps in honey, then coat them thoroughly with this powder. Wrap in Kunlun paper, place a lotus before them, and set within the *Sheng Wu Zhi* chamber. Nurture in the ash pool for seven days with four taels of fire. The white body becomes a treasure. This elixir must undergo seven cycles before completion and storage.

**Fifth Transformation**
Take the previously nurtured white-body chamber and place it within the crucible. Pour two taels of mercury over it, seal tightly, and set in the ash pool. Nurture with two to three taels of fire for seven days. Open, then pour another two taels of mercury, and nurture for another seven days. Repeat this process twice more, each time adding two taels of mercury and nurturing for seven days—twenty-eight days in total. Then add three taels of mercury, and nurture with yin fire four times over twenty-eight days. For the fourth cycle, add four taels of mercury and six taels of yin fire, another twenty-eight days. Finally, pour five taels of mercury with six taels of fire, completing four cycles of twenty-eight days each.

**Sixth Transformation**
Take the previously nurtured *yu-xiao* (jade laughter) without damaging it, and place it in a silver-inlaid box. Set upon a fire furnace with five taels of yin fire, and pour five taels of mercury. Replenish every three days, repeating this process endlessly. When removed, it will resemble a forest of jade trees, its form like a head, red as coral. Break it to reveal the treasure.

**Seventh Transformation**
Grind two taels of the previous *yu-xiao* into fine powder. First place half in the crucible, then add one tael each of realgar, orpiment, sulfur, and *liu-sha*, all ground together, into the crucible. Cover with the remaining half of *yu-xiao* powder, seal tightly, and subdue with one jin of yin fire for three days. Remove—a lump like gold. Crush four taels, add one tael of cinnabar, and warm for seven days with four taels of fire. Remove and refine by smoke to achieve the finest purple *mo-jin* (polished gold). For the second cycle, nurture two taels of cinnabar for seven days with four taels of fire.

**Eighth Transformation**
Take the previously nurtured eight taels of cinnabar, pour two taels of mercury, and nurture with four taels of yin fire and four taels of *zheng* fire for seven days to form the treasure. Replenish with mercury every seven days, cycling endlessly. At this stage, proceed according to one’s karmic capacity.

**Ninth Transformation**
Take half a jin of sulfur, melt it in a jumping vessel, add two taels of mercury, and stir-fry until black. Grind into powder. Layer the powder from the seventh transformation’s Three Yellows over it, seal tightly, and nurture with four taels of fire for three days, then six taels of fire for four days. Pour four taels of mercury to form the finest mountain-and-marsh white treasure. Continue this process in seven-day cycles with fire, completing forty-nine days in total.

**Tenth Transformation**
Grind the elixir head from the ninth transformation into powder. Place an iron jumping vessel with five taels of mercury beneath, and apply half a jin of fire. Sprinkle three qian of the elixir powder over it, seal with a lid, and reinforce with damp paper. When the cicada’s song ceases, cease firing—a single firing yields five taels of mountain-and-marsh supreme treasure.

**Eleventh Transformation**
Take one tael of the ninth transformation’s jade powder and one tael of mercury refined in the tenth transformation, grind them together into powder. Melt one jin of red silver, add one tael of this powder, and it will transform into a white-body supreme treasure.

**Twelfth Transformation**
Combine one tael of the Three Yellows from the seventh transformation, one tael of cinnabar from the sixth transformation, and one tael of mercury from the tenth transformation into a cake. Place in the crucible and nurture for seven days before storage. Then, within the *yao* vessel, add five taels of mercury to the previous mixture, nurturing to produce four *shen* and two qian. Cover with a lid, apply half a jin of fire below, and when the cicada’s song begins, increase the fire for one firing to form the finest purple *chang* supreme treasure.

**Thirteenth Transformation**
Take five taels of mercury-sulfur from the ninth transformation, add one tael each of the finest realgar, orpiment, sulfur, and *peng-sha*, grind together, and place in a sealed vessel. Nurture in the furnace for twenty-one days, using two taels of fire by day and four taels by night. Remove to transmute the Five Metals and Eight Stones into supreme treasure.

**Fourteenth Transformation**
Form the Three Yellows from the previous refinement into a chamber, nurture two taels of the finest cinnabar within for twenty-one days—first with two taels of fire, then three, then four to completion. Remove the cinnabar, grind it with the Three Yellows into powder, and shape into pellets the size of soybeans with dew water. Ingest with flowing water to prolong life by a hundred years, attain immortality, and move as swiftly as a galloping horse.

**Fifteenth Transformation**
Take the previously nurtured cinnabar, refine it into gold, and cast a divine crucible large enough to hold the ingredients. Also cast an iron crucible, lining its interior with a paste of mica, *zeng-qing* (azurite), rock crystal, *hu-zhong-ying* stone, and lead dan, mixed with paper mulberry juice. Place the divine chamber within, then select a high and auspicious site to construct a hut and altar for the refinement of the Great Elixir.

**Sixteenth Transformation**
First, take two jin of mercury from the fourteenth transformation’s Three Yellows and three jin of *er-ba* divine cinnabar, mix and grind evenly, then pound thirty thousand times. Place in the divine crucible and seal tightly. Then set within the large iron crucible, sealing all seams securely. Reinforce with *liu-yi* mud, place in the ash pool or Heaven-and-Earth furnace. Align the upper water and lower fire crucibles, and nurture with five jin of fire for one month, three jin for another month, one jin for another month, and five jin for ten days—one hundred days in total. Remove and bury in the earth to dispel fire qi for one year. Then suspend in well water for one hundred days. Remove, grind thirty thousand times into powder, and form into pellets the size of mung beans with sweet dew water. Return to the divine chamber and nurture with four taels of fire for seven days. When complete, remove. Feed one pellet to a chicken, and it will transform into a phoenix and fly away; feed one to a dog, and it will become a dragon and soar.

With this elixir, offer thanks to Heaven and Earth and the Northern Dipper. Discard one portion in renowned mountains and great rivers, then it may be ingested to attain true immortality. Without sufficient virtue and power, one cannot reach this stage—proceed with caution. Once a person has taken it, soak it in golden sweet-dew juice, grind it thoroughly three times a month, and dispel the fire toxin before consumption, ascending directly to the ranks of immortals. The practice must prioritize aiding the poor and delivering all beings—this is proper. During refinement, each transformation may be ingested in stages, yet nothing compares to completing nine cycles and sixteen transformations, where success reveals its wondrous efficacy, truly the stuff of immortals. The key lies in unwavering resolve and diligent practice; none who persist shall fail to achieve it.

**External Elixir: Method for Preparing a Silver Receptacle**
Pound silver into thin sheets, dip in vinegar, and sprinkle with sulfur powder. Cover with five to seven leaves of paddy-field grass, seal all seams, and heat until glowing red. Allow to cool, then grind into powder.

**Cinnabar Method**
Take one tael of fine cinnabar, one *fen* each of native sulfur and *que* sulfur, and half a *fen* of borax. Mix with vinegar and fermented water in a porcelain vessel, and boil for three days and nights. If the vinegar evaporates, keep a separate vessel of warm vinegar by the fire to replenish it gradually, ensuring it lasts a full day. Remove, wash with warm water, and measure the quantity of the substance. Seal in a vessel of appropriate size: first spread a layer of silver powder, then fill with cinnabar. Seal the seams with honey-mixed clamshell powder, let dry, and place in an ash pool, covering the top with ash to the thickness of a finger.

Begin with one and a half taels of fire, nurturing for three days. Then add two taels of fire, nurturing for seven days. Next, add three taels of fire, nurturing until twenty days. Then increase by one tael of fire up to forty taels, nurturing for forty-nine days. Remove and heat over fire until subdued, then it may be used. To refine silver, melt it in a lead crucible. To enhance the receptacle, do not grind the final product; instead, layer and nurture as before, increasing the fire by one day. Apply fire at midnight and noon, strictly adhering to the schedule.

**Three Sages Method (also called Minor Ninefold Dryness)**
Take ten taels of fine cinnabar, one tael of sulfur, and one tael of mercury. Grind the three ingredients together for a full day until extremely fine, with no visible mercury. Press firmly into a vessel, then add one tael of fresh *fo’er* grass (i.e., *yunjiang*) pounded with one *qian* of salt. Grind further into a paste and spread over the vessel’s lid as sealing medicine. Outside the vessel, mix stone fat, *shengwuzhi*, sacred ash, and vinegar-charcoal ash into a mud, and seal the vessel’s opening securely.

Select an auspicious site and dig a pit one *chi* and two *cun* deep and wide. Drive a nail to secure the fire gate, then purify the pit inside and out with hot vinegar mixed with two *qian* of charcoal ash. Place the vessel inside, stabilize it, and sift fine charcoal ash over it until covered to the thickness of a finger. Add another layer of charcoal ash five *cun* thick on top, then apply fire as follows:
- First day: one *jin* of fire.
- Second day: two *jin* of fire.

On the third day, apply three *jin* of fire. On the fourth day, apply one *cheng*. Calcine with charcoal fire for a full day, then cease. Wait until completely cooled before opening the sixth vent to retrieve the vessel. Upon inspection, the cinnabar will appear as blood-red specks, resembling a mirror’s surface.

For the right-hand ingredient: take one *liang* of cinnabar, grind it to an extremely fine powder, and affix it to the vessel’s lid with paper. Replace the leaves and proceed as before, sealing the vessel securely. The firing process may be repeated three, five, six, or seven times, each following the initial method. The sealing and firing for the eighth iteration remain identical.

Remove the vessel’s contents, grind finely, and add the following ingredients: one *qian* each of saltpeter, sal ammoniac, alum, green vitriol, willow vitriol, and borax. Grind these together with the aforementioned powder, pack tightly into the vessel, and spread one *liang* of finely ground sulfur on top. Seal the vessel securely. The sealing medicine and firing method remain as previously described.

Apply four *liang* of fire and nurture for seven days. Then apply half a *jin* of fire and nurture for another seven days. Finally, apply one *jin* of fire and nurture for seven days. Afterward, use one *cheng* of fire to refine the contents fully. Once cooled, retrieve the vessel—the sulfur will have risen to the top, separate from the other ingredients. Gently scoop it out with a spoon and set it aside; do not mix it with the cinnabar powder.

Grind the previously calcined base powder finely, add one *liang* of the refined cinnabar, and grind them together. Place the mixture into the vessel, seal it securely, and apply fire as in the eighth iteration, using one *cheng* of fire until fully refined. Retrieve the contents, grind finely, and divide into three portions.

For one portion: mix with red rice paste to form pills, each weighing one *qian*. When used in shade, one *qian* of this pill can dry ten *liang* of mercury. Place the mercury in a crucible, apply half a *jin* of mature fire to heat it until a faint smoke rises, then sprinkle one crushed pill on top. Immediately place a lit stick of mature fire across the crucible’s mouth; the mercury will scatter with a hissing sound. Once the sound ceases, heap three *jin* of fire around it and calcine until glowing red. Carefully pour the contents into a quenching pit, cover with damp paper, and retrieve the product without loss.

For another portion: add one *liang* each of high-quality orpiment and fine blue vitriol, grind together, and place into the vessel. Seal as before, bury in the ash pit, and apply three *jin* of fire, nurturing for three days. Then apply two *cheng* of fire to refine fully. Once cooled, retrieve and grind the contents. One *liang* of this powder, divided into ten parts, can dry ten *liang* of mercury each, producing a superior *gengxin* substance.

For the final portion: add one *liang* of *fen shuang*, grind thoroughly, place into the vessel, and seal as before. Apply two *cheng* of fire to calcine until red, then cool and retrieve. Grind finely; one *liang* of this powder, divided into ten parts, can condense ten *liang* of mercury into treasure. *Textual variants noted.*

**Embryo-Shedding Sprout**
Take one *liang* of mercury-subduing cinnabar, add one *liang* of mercury refined with yellow *ken*, and apply three *liang* of top-fire. Alternate the fire at *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours, nurturing for three *mou* periods until the mercury is subdued, resembling jade laughter. Repeat the refining and nurturing as before; select only the firm and mature portions for use, calling this the *Embryo-Shedding Sprout*. Perform this four times over twelve days, after which transmutation refining may begin.

**Mother-Detached Sprout**
For transmutation refining, use five *liang* of *Embryo-Shedding Sprout* and four *liang* of refined mercury, applying four *liang* of top-fire. Nurture for three *mou* periods, using a water cauldron below. Repeat this six times over eighteen days to obtain twenty-four *liang*. The substance will naturally form into flakes and lumps, with no adhesion between earlier and later stages—this is called the *Mother-Detached Sprout*. Bathe it in the *Flowery Pond*, expose it to the dew for one night, and the *Embryo-Shedding Sprout* will become azure-green and hard as stone.

**Flowery Pond Method**
Use sulfur, sal ammoniac, borax, and green vitriol, adding one *sheng* of pure wine; all else remains the same.

**Heaven-Produced Yellow Sprout**
Cinnabar, chalcanthite, and Chinese gall—grind these three ingredients together and sift into a fine powder. Moisten the cinnabar with rice vinegar, then coat it evenly and thickly in the center. Wrap it tightly in *Head Gold Sand*, using the *finger-wrapping method*, with one *dou* of rice vinegar and one *liang* of green salt. Suspend and boil until dry. For each *liang* of cinnabar, mix in three *liang* of finely ground *Embryo-Shedding Sprout* powder, then place in a yellow *ken* for subduing fire. Seal the opening with salt, apply one *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* hours, and nurture for seven *mou* periods. When complete, the salt will have dissolved entirely. Retrieve the cinnabar, peel away the *Head Gold Sand*, wash the cinnabar clean—it will be uniformly red as gold, but do not melt it. For each *liang*, add five *liang* of mercury, grind evenly, and place in the *Spirit Chamber*. Set it within the yellow *ken*, seal the opening, and apply half a *jin* of fire to calcine until half dry. Add another *jin* of fire, and when the fire has fully subsided, retrieve it cold. The mercury will have dried, resembling gold—this is called *Heaven-Produced Yellow Sprout*, also known as *White Horse Sprout* or *True Lead*. The cinnabar will have ascended to the top of the *Spirit Chamber*, light as a wasp’s nest—this is the *True Purple River Chariot*, ready for use.

For each *liang* of *Heaven-Produced Yellow Sprout*, add three *liang* of mercury. Apply four *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, and nurture for one *pan* period until the mercury is dry. For every three *liang* of dried mercury, mix in cinnabar or *Spirit Sand*, grind evenly, and place in an iron vessel to refine the mercury—the mercury will not be exhausted.

**Purple Gold and White Snow**
Grind two *liang* of purple powder, one *liang* of mercury, and one *liang* of sulfur together until no specks remain and no sound is heard. Place in the *Great One’s Heavenly Palace*, set within a yellow *ken*, and apply two *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, nurturing for five *sui* periods. Add one *liang* of mercury and nurture again, increasing the mercury to ten *liang* as before. When retrieved, the elixir body will disperse, its color like gold. Each *qian* can refine five *liang* of mercury into purple gold. Its power is equal to the Great Elixir. When a small amount is tossed into the air, it transforms into white snow, rising higher and farther until its bounds are unknowable. Melt and shape it into spoons or chopsticks for use—if poison is encountered, the poison will scatter and disperse.

Refine five *liang* of purple powder with rice vinegar, fashion it into a vessel, and let it dry. Place three *liang* of mercury inside, set it in a yellow *ken*, seal the opening, and apply fire to nurture for one *mou* period—the mercury will dry. Grind one *liang* each of cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment evenly, then mix with two *liang* of hardened purple powder. Seal the opening, apply two *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, and nurture for ten *pan* periods. Retrieve, grind finely, and form into pills the size of *mung beans* with paper mulberry juice. Each pill can instantly dry five *liang* of mercury. Cover three *liang* of cinnabar with four *liang* of *Four Spirits*, apply two *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for seven *mou* periods. Retrieve, grind finely, and form into pills the size of *soybeans* with paper mulberry juice—these can revive the dead.

Grind half a *jin* of purple powder and one *jin* of mercury together until no specks remain, place in a yellow *ken*, seal the opening, and apply four *liang* of top-fire to nurture for one *mou* period—this can transmute the Five Metals into treasure. Grind one *liang* each of *Purple River Chariot* and cinnabar with four *liang* of realgar evenly, place in an iron vessel, seal tightly, and apply two *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, nurturing for forty-nine days. Add one *liang* of mercury, grind evenly, apply five *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, and nurture for five *pan* periods. Refine five *liang* of mercury as before—the mercury will dry and transform entirely into gold, its refining and nurturing inexhaustible. This is called the *Immortal’s Golden Valley and Jade-Field Transmutation Method*.

Grind one *liang* each of *Purple River Chariot* and cinnabar with four *liang* of realgar evenly, place in an iron vessel, seal tightly, and apply two *liang* of top-fire, alternating at *mao* and *you* hours, nurturing for forty-nine *pan* periods. Add one *liang* of mercury, grind until no specks remain, apply two *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for seven *mou* periods. Add mercury and nurture again, following the previous method until the mercury reaches one *jin*. When retrieved, its color will be like radiant purple gold. Grind finely and form into pills the size of sesame seeds with paper mulberry juice—each pill can refine one *jin* of mercury into purple gold.

Cover one *liang* of *Purple River Chariot* with one *liang* of realgar, place in the *Great One’s Heavenly Palace*, set within a yellow *ken*, and apply two *liang* of top-fire to nurture for three *mou* periods before retrieving. Grind the realgar finely, and for each half-*liang*, stir in ten *liang* of mercury in an iron pan. Follow the usual method until the sound ceases, then nurture for one *mou* period, gradually intensifying the heat until it glows red throughout, forming purple gold.

Grind four *liang* of *Purple River Chariot* with half a *jin* of mercury until no specks remain, place in an iron vessel, seal tightly, and apply two *liang* of top-fire to nurture for forty-nine *pan* periods.

Grind finely, then nurture for another year, mix with grain juice, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds—each pill can refine one *jin* of mercury into purple gold.

Take five *liang* each of *White Gold Sand* and mercury, and congeal them into granules. Cover with *Yellow-White Gold Essence*, place in a yellow *ken*, apply one and a half *liang* of top-fire, and alternate between *mao* and *you* periods to nurture for seven *pan* periods until complete, naming it *Precious Shoot*. Divide into two portions: use one portion to congeal mercury into granules, following the previous method in every step. Divide, congeal, and nurture again—after nine transformations, it can transmute the Five Metals.

Nurture *Precious Shoot* with mercury, regulating the fire, furnace, and crucible as in the method for nurturing the *Elixir Head*. After ten infusions, the *Precious Shoot*’s power is exhausted; it may then be smelted into silver, also called *Immortal’s Golden Grain* or *Jade-Field Guard*.

Grind the sprouts of *Precious Shoot* finely, cover with five *liang* of cinnabar, place in a yellow *jian*, apply five *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for five *mou* periods. Retrieve without altering its innate color, then mix with raw cinnabar in equal measure, grind evenly, place in the *Great One’s Heavenly Palace*, set within a yellow *zheng*, and nurture with gentle fire for twenty-one *mou* periods. When the cinnabar’s body disperses into a golden hue, it is called *Red-Stone Cinnabar*. Used to make *Bright Window Dust*, it is a most wondrous thing.

**White Horse Tooth Transformation Method**
Melt eight *liang* of yellow gold in a crucible with *qi*-fire and saltpeter, stirring until fully dissolved. Grind *White Horse Tooth* finely, and add one *daorui* at a time to the molten liquid until completely dissolved. Once settled, place the crucible in ash, chill thoroughly, and break it open to naturally separate the embryo, naming it *Yellow Sprout*.

Grind equal parts *Yellow Sprout* and cinnabar finely, place in a crucible (filling no more than seven-tenths), cover with a tile shard leaving a vent, and melt with fire. Place in ash, chill thoroughly, and break open to reveal the cinnabar subdued, its color like molten silver. Cut into dice, wrap in fine silk, and suspend in a sand pot. Add equal parts *green salt*, *sal ammoniac*, *pomegranate rind*, and *oil-acid*, then boil in fermented water for one *pan* period. Rinse with boiling water forty-five times to remove all medicinal residue, then dry by baking.

For each *jin*, grind with four *liang* of mercury until no specks remain. Place in a yellow *ken*, seal tightly, and once dry, set upon a level ash mound. Surround with five *jin* of charcoal (half raw, half cooked), and fire until spent. When cold, retrieve the mercury—it will have fully merged with the cinnabar, its essence and marrow transformed without the slightest loss, called *True Subdued-Fire Silver-Colored Cinnabar*.

Grind twenty *liang* of *Silver-Colored Cinnabar* finely. Spread eight *liang* on the bottom of a yellow *zheng*, place ten *liang* of cinnabar in the center coated with silver powder, then cover with twelve *liang* of *Silver-Colored Cinnabar*, pressing firmly. Seal tightly, apply four to five *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for seven *pan* periods. Fire with three to two *jin* of charcoal until spent, then retrieve when cold. The cinnabar that enters the vessel grants longevity; the longer it endures, the more potent it becomes. If the cinnabar turns black as iron, after a thousand refinements it will still yield golden liquid, its essence unshaken and without the slightest loss—this is called *Iron-Colored Cinnabar*. Hammered into pellets the size of rabbit droppings, it can transmute the Five Metals.

Melt one *liang* each of *Copper Snail Stone*, black lead, and *White Iron* into liquid, then add seven *qian* of *Iron-Colored Cinnabar* and stir over a blazing fire until clear. Pour into ash, chill thoroughly, and break open—the cinnabar will remain intact on top, while the Five Metals below will have transformed into *Snowflake Mercury Silver*. If the cinnabar’s transmutative power weakens, grind it finely to make the outer vessel for *Red Lychee Silver*.

For cinnabar the size of imperial pearls, wrap it in *Three-Seven Sand* granules, then encase in two layers of *Kunlun* paper and silk. Boil with *white alum* (which blooms at dawn and withers by dusk) in flowing water for a day, then trim evenly. After transmuting with *Iron-Colored Cinnabar*, grind seven *qian* finely, knead with honey into a paste, wrap again in two layers of *Kunlun* paper, seal with refined mud, and dry. Surround with four *jin* of charcoal on the ground, then heap three *jin* of cooked fire to heat until thoroughly red. Turn the ball and add the remaining fire, then remove the heat when eight-tenths spent. When cold, retrieve the granules and cinnabar—both will have become supreme treasures, called *Red Lychee Iron-Colored Cinnabar*. Though unaltered and without loss, its power is further diminished.

If gathered to one *jin*, grind with four *liang* of mercury until no specks remain, place in a yellow *zheng*, seal tightly, and once dry, set steadily on level ground. Encase in a damp ash mound, surround with five *jin* of charcoal (half raw, half cooked), and fire until spent. When cold, retrieve without the slightest loss, forming *Longevity Granules* for the vessel.

Divide ten *liang* of *Three-Seven Sand* into ten pills, wrap loosely in palm fiber with *white alum* (which blooms at dawn and withers by dusk), and boil in flowing water for a day. Spread eight *liang* of *Longevity Vessel* on the bottom of a yellow *zheng*, arrange the granules evenly atop, then cover with twelve *liang* and press firmly. Seal tightly, apply four *liang* of top-fire, and nurture for seven *mou* periods. Fire with three *jin* of charcoal until thoroughly red, then remove the heat and retrieve when cold—the granules will be fully subdued and unshaken. With prolonged refinement, the vessel’s color gradually yellows, progressing through *Two-Eight* and *One-Nine*, until it reaches *My Lotus*. Through mercury infusions and controlled grinding, the vessel’s hue deepens. Only then can one truly appreciate the cinnabar’s efficacy, distinct from the Eight Stones.

**Longevity Vessel**
Twenty *liang* of cinnabar, two *liang* each of realgar and orpiment. Half a *liang* each of *yellow alum*, *chalcanthite*, *willow-floss alum*, and *grape green*. Weigh the seven ingredients, grind evenly, and wrap in two layers of fine silk. Measure portions of *sal ammoniac*, realgar, orpiment, *yellow alum*, *black alum*, *malachite*, *green salt*, *hematite*, and *willow-floss alum*.

Weigh the nine ingredients, grind evenly to a fine powder, and place them in rice vinegar. Suspend and boil for the duration of two watches. Remove and dry over a slow fire, then place in a yellow vessel, seal tightly, and wait until dry. Use five *jin* of firewood, allowing the fire to extinguish naturally on the ground. Once cooled, remove the light and floating particles, grind finely to form a vessel, and nurture the golden cinnabar granules—every step follows the method for nurturing silver cinnabar. With prolonged refinement, the vessel may nurture cinnabar as well, just as cinnabar is nurtured, each granule penetrating to the core. This is called *Golden Elixir Embracing Gold*, which, when smelted, becomes gold. However, both golden cinnabar and cinnabar must first be boiled in the nine-flavor vinegar for the duration of one watch before they can be nurtured. The nine-flavor vinegar may be stored for prolonged use; if depleted, more vinegar may be added.
