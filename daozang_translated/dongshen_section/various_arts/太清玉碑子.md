*The Jade Tablet of Great Clarity*

*The Jade Brick of Great Clarity* (alternatively titled). Author unknown, approximately dated between the Tang and Song dynasties. Falsely attributed to a dialogue between Ge Hong and Zheng Siyuan, it discusses the Dao of inner and outer alchemy. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, "Esoteric Arts" category under the *Dongshen* section.

*The Jade Tablet of Great Clarity*

Ge Zhichuan bows deeply to Zheng Siyuan and says: I have earnestly heard that the primordial yin essence and yang essence—yang essence establishes the hun-soul, yin essence completes the po-soul. When the two essences interact, they give rise to spirit and illumination. Spirit functions through form, and form is born of spirit. When spirit departs, form likewise perishes. Dare I ask, Master: can spirit be preserved whole, and can form be prolonged?

He replies: Spirit is preserved whole through the Dao, and form is prolonged through technique.

Ge Hong further asks: What is the essence of the Dao and its techniques?

He says: The Dao is hidden and nameless, yet its defense manifests in reality. Techniques manifest in reality, and thus they can be practiced. The Dao is hidden and nameless, yet through it, the Dao may be accomplished. When the Dao is accomplished, spirit is naturally preserved whole; when techniques are practiced, form is naturally prolonged.

Ge Hong says: The Dao is hidden and nameless, initially existing beyond all images. Its defense manifests in reality, ultimately residing within the corporeal shell. I humbly beseech you, Master, to slightly bestow your enlightening instruction.

He says: Now, as for techniques: they involve bending and stretching, embryonic breathing, and swallowing saliva; controlling the young maiden to return essence, and ingesting cinnabar to preserve the body. Beyond this, I have not heard.

Ge Hong says: The method of returning essence I have already received from your teachings. The method of preserving the body I now wish to have revealed to dispel my ignorance.

Master Zheng says: Take the essence of metal and the fluid of stone, unite them as husband and wife, array them as hun and po. In a single undifferentiated state, the two natures stir and excite. The River Chariot inverts and bears the load, the crucible’s throat privately swallows. The great furnace blazes with fierce fire, flames roaring and flaring. Before the smoke turns black, before the flames glow azure, it is like nurturing a whirlwind, like concealing thunder. The maiden’s qi is exhausted, the infant’s voice falls silent. Penetrating the Two Modes, it adorns the four walls. After some time—like a horse galloping a single post—it seems dead, yet suddenly transforms. Evil is cast out, good is promoted; emotions return and nature is altered.

The purple hue penetrates within, the crimson radiance shoots outward. It shines as if fire is born, yet seems like blood dripping. Named the "Inner Reversal," it can transcend great calamity. Retreat and conceal in secrecy, ingest it without instruction. Mist disperses within the five viscera, rivers flow through the hundred channels. Bones transform into metal and stone, the complexion returns to jade-like luster. Yang’s virtue spreads forth, yin’s merit privately accumulates. The name is recorded in the Southern Palace, the register is struck from the Northern Emperor’s ledger. It is the foremost of the Dao, the chief of immortality. Do not transmit it to the unworthy, lest you incur divine censure.

Master Hong says: Heaven and earth are vast, yet the body is small by comparison. Who of shallow understanding could comprehend the refinement of the most essence to form the elixir? What cause for concern is there?

When qi is paired, it harmonizes; when qi is solitary, it withers. Harmony extends life, withering hastens death. Once the thread of destiny is severed, it is difficult to reconnect. Yet principle is sought through intention, and intention lies beyond words. Let me now attempt to speak of it.

That which is called the Dao consists of the interplay of one yin and one yang; the elixir consists of one metal and one stone. Stone rides the yang and is hot; metal rides the yin and is cold. In their ingestion, one takes the external yang to subdue the internal yin. In their effects, they cause the hun to scatter and the po to linger. Like water flowing toward moisture, like fire moving toward dryness—this is the inevitable tendency, and the principle is observable.

I humbly hope, Master, that you will permit further inquiry.

The Master says: Your words contain refined meaning worthy of adoption. When yang reaches its end at *si*, when yin reaches its extreme at *hai*, they divide into the four seasons, circulating without cease. Heaven and earth interact, sun and moon pair—how could these be omitted? Let me briefly outline the essentials.

Moreover, the stone’s fluid hides in spectral secrecy, the metal’s essence resides in the mountains. How lamentable is the solitary transformation of the imperial yin, how swiftly the nine depths may be summoned! How much better is the gentleman’s pursuit of transmission, like a virtuous maiden’s fine match. Only then do yin and yang attain balance, and hun and po remain without dispersion.

Alas, the fleeting lives of worldly men are like lightning, pointing to mulberry fields transformed into seas. Your words align with the immortal formulas, and my Dao attains its true governance.

Master Hong says: My reckless words coincidentally accord with true principle. How does one refine the stone’s fluid?

The Master says: There is a thing with form, vast and enduring. Gather it before the silkworms feed, employ it after the fire’s transformation. Pour boiling water from above to drench below, fill the empty cauldron to receive it. As the sun and moon revolve, observe the five cycles of subjugation. Strike the bellows vigorously, and the golden liquid will not escape. Water is used to temper it, so it passes from existence into non-existence. Fire is used to fan it, so it arises from non-existence into existence. The white powder gleams like snow for a moment, the yellow paste congeals like base gold. Through ceaseless transformation, spirits hasten and ghosts gallop. Grasping and refining intent and qi, reversing decay and decrepitude—whether metal or stone, it bestows heavenly years and earthly longevity. Do not fixate on the text; the secret lies in the oral transmission.

*The Jade Vessel Song* says:
The jade vessel is whole and round, its porcelain lid radiant.
Above and below align, interlocking like a dog’s teeth.
One-third of it is the constant of heaven and earth.
An inch in diameter, neither too wide nor too narrow—just slightly stronger than the external.
Not discussing the high net, nor the primal yang.
Do not discard the pure origin; the outer boundary is critical.
Bind with rattan and stir until thoroughly blended.
Secure it repeatedly, ensuring the interior remains moist.
Weigh it precisely, melting and fusing in harmony.
Now purple, now yellow, sometimes white, sometimes black.
Stir until chaotic, unable to distinguish north from south.
The constant of heaven and earth, the model of the sage.
Establish the system with fire alone, the oyster powder with grease—only ensure firmness.
No need for five or two; the juncture must be solid.
One must draw in qi, as the sages transmit the method.
The ebb and flow lie in intention; first establish the city walls.
Complete the martial array, first inspect the five nodes.
Then transmit the six spirits, leaping above and below.
Suddenly, patterns appear, the form dissolves and transforms.
It becomes a numinous essence, yet the numinous essence is difficult to comprehend.
The deluded cannot easily grasp it; failure lies in adding or removing.
Success lies in receiving qi—this is the way of immortality.
Not for the unworthy; I transmit it to the Heavenly Master.

*The Stone Record of Kongtong* states: From ancient times to the present, scholars are as numerous as hemp, yet none grasp its subtlety. Exhausting their strength and impoverishing their families, they seek to know its essentials. One must fiercely refine the Three Flowers, merging into chaotic darkness. When mist scatters and clouds disperse, one attains spiritual communion. The seventh reversal is wondrous, perilously seizing the lightning’s red. Radiance shines afar, edges and corners emerge sharply. Through complete illumination, the ancient sages’ secret transmission. The essence of immortality lies in the cold spring’s submersion, driving out the Great Yang, warming the rice to soar. Dispelling yin’s afflictions, grind it exceedingly fine. The medicine is extraordinary, like nine beans in seal-script. Do not force it; take three grains each morning. Beginning on a *jiazi* day, continue for a thousand days. One attains spiritual clarity and penetrating vision, the complexion rosy and fair. The visage like a child’s, spirit settled and breath calm. For a thousand autumns, eternal sacrifice.

*The Two Poems of the Supreme One’s Secret Transmission to the Heavenly Master*:
Five talismans, Three Flowers, and the axle’s control,
Combined with the north’s self-destructive force.
Add one more day to make half a month,
Black metal is expelled, white as snow.
The hall fills with yellow gold, unceasing,
Servants and maids flock together, red as blood.
Father and son must not transmit it to each other;
The divine way’s hidden depths will punish transgression.
I impart to you the oral secret by karmic affinity.

*The Supreme Clarity Scripture’s Oral Secret Talisman*:
Eight waters, eight fires, two eights make a catty.
Sun’s essence, moon’s splendor, gradually intermingle.
Do not value wealth and goods, lest your family grow poor.
The Earth God is moved, Heaven has no favorites.
Yet clinging to worldly glory, the undying old man.
Lush and verdant, long preserving the yang spring.

*The Song of Yin Changsheng*:
Heaven-born teeth, white cinnabar,
Merge their qi, become one family.
The path is not wrong, wisdom has no embellishment.
The Dao lies here, rising in clouds and mist.
Your death is due to my life, my death is due to your life.
Gold’s work in black and white completes my five phases.

*The Five Metals Song and Dragon-Tiger Secret*:
Those who cultivate the Dao seek the principle of longevity.
Without attaining the Great Reversal, there will be no day of success.

Those who encounter this secret have accumulated blessings over many lives before finally obtaining it—guard it well and keep it hidden. Should it be transmitted to one unworthy of the Dao, seven generations of ancestors will suffer retribution, and calamity will extend to descendants.

In refining the Great Medicine, success does not lie in the multitude of ingredients but in the precise alignment of method and symbolism, the harmonious interaction of ruler and minister, grasping the essence of immortality, and uniting with the fundamental principle of the Dao—the power of the Great Reversal. Prolonged ingestion extends years, yielding the efficacy of transcendence. Without understanding its ebb and flow, mineral medicines will ultimately prove toxic; their use will bring harm—how then can one attain longevity?

The *Chapter on Ruler and Minister* states: Lead and mercury are the root of the Great Reversal, the foundation of gold. The eight minerals serve as the host, inherently heatless yet warm. Yin resides within yin; inherently active yet cool, yang dwells within yang. Thus it is said: yin and yang oppose each other. Yin is the ruler, yang the minister. When stone floats and metal sinks, ruler and minister align; when floating and sinking are balanced, medicines harmonize—this is the subtle essence of immortality. Without knowing ruler and minister, without comprehending their harmony, one may spend a thousand pieces of gold yet never achieve success. If one understands ruler and minister, uniting qian and kun, then lead serves as ruler, drawing forth the five viscera; mercury as minister, subduing the three thieves. Mercury as envoy preserves the spirit and sharpens the senses. Cinnabar as general subdues the four barbarians, connecting with the divine and illuminating the four seas.

The *Cantong Qi* states:
Use lead yet not lead—five metals arise from lead.
Use lead yet not lead—the Returned Elixir emerges from lead.
Use lead yet not lead—refine further within lead.
Use lead yet not lead—gold naturally issues from lead.
Let the wise ponder this, and they will understand how the Dao may be accomplished.
Use lead yet not lead—lead is the marrow of the five metals, the fine catalyst of the seven treasures. The five metals strictly forbid tin, nor may it be used.

The Great Reversal Elixir consists of two ingredients, completing heaven and earth. Since the five metals are forbidden, what then is used to refine it?
Answer: To refine it, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root.
What is the Yellow Sprout, and what vessel is used to refine it?
The *Song of the Five Metals* says:
The crucible is no crucible; the medicine is no medicine.
The Yellow Sprout is not lead, yet it is made without departing from lead.

Hu Waizi asked: If the Yellow Sprout does not depart from lead, and is made within lead, what is it refined from? And if the five metals and eight minerals are not used, from whence does the Yellow Sprout arise?
Wei Gong replied: To sow grain, one must use millet; foxes and hares do not nurse horses, nor do sparrows give birth to phoenixes. Different species cannot propagate their kind—how then could they unite with their origin? To transmute gold, one must use gold; to transmute silver, one must use silver. If the world’s people all used the five metals and eight minerals, nothing would ever be accomplished.

The *Song of the Great Reversal Elixir* says:
If lead is true, it does not lose its minister.
If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near.
The Azure Waist Envoy, the Crimson Blood General,
White Tiger as brain, Yellow Sprout as root.
Yet if people directly use lead, none in the world recognize mercury or the Azure Waist Envoy. Some say this refers to azurite and malachite, while the Crimson Blood General is red lead. But the world’s people, deluded and confused, mistakenly use these yellow medicines for transmutation, yet none succeed.

It is said: The origin of the Great Reversal Elixir lies in the Azure Waist Envoy as water, the Crimson Blood General as fire, White Tiger as brain (mercury), and Yellow Sprout as root (lead). Speaking of the origin of the Returned Elixir: the Yellow Sprout is one, mercury is two, their weights are three, water is four, fire is five—these correspond to the five phases. When yin and yang unite, after ten months the gestation is complete, and it departs the mother’s womb. Mercury belongs to the east, lead to the west, water to the north, fire to the south, and the Yellow Sprout to the center—this mirrors metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Yellow and white each occupy their place; if one follows this method, not a single attempt will fail.

As for the oral instructions, I wish to record them on bamboo and silk, but above I fear revealing heavenly secrets, and below I fear incurring kalpic sins—such knowledge is not meant for the world’s ears. The Dao fundamentally nurtures the poor and sustains life; whatever remains after my needs are met, I distribute as alms and offerings. If one indulges in extravagance and wasteful use, misfortune will swiftly arise. Those who receive the Dao yet fail to grasp the master of medicines will invite disaster.

The Great Elixir is formed from two substances, without the addition of miscellaneous medicines. While the five metals and eight minerals each have their uses, none are incorporated into the Great Reversal Elixir. Yet the world’s people, not understanding this, mistakenly combine them in elixir refinement, attempting transmutation. This is but a minor art, not the Great Elixir. There is good reason for this: sulfur is the essence of the Great Yang, mercury the essence of the Great Yin. The union of one yin and one yang forms heaven and earth. Sulfur can restrain mercury, containing within it crimson qi. When sulfur restrains it once, it transforms into cinnabar. Beginning with mercury, it reverts to cinnabar—this is called the Nine Revolutions. Since sulfur is the essence of the Great Yang, it cannot be subdued by fire. Using yang to restrain yang, yang gradually weakens while yin’s power grows. When sulfur restrains it, it becomes cinnabar. Though refined into primordial cinnabar, it still cannot withstand fire. The process must undergo the Nine Revolutions before it can be subdued by fire—this is mercury’s nature. Each revolution employs sulfur; by the ninth, mercury is used. The weights remain unchanged, sulfur’s form and shadow vanish—how then does mercury endure? Mercury is yin, sulfur is yang; after nine revolutions, yin is fully subdued, yang is exhausted, and mercury can withstand fire. This is called Nine Revolutions Cinnabar, also known as the Lesser Returned Elixir. This medicine cannot dry mercury; it can only transmute iron into gold and silver into gold. It is also suitable for ingestion but cannot serve other purposes.

The *Gold Song* further states:
"Cinnabar, oh cinnabar,
It sustains life and enriches the household.
Nurture the wondrous maiden,
And wed her to the Yellow Sprout."

Place but a single grain of this cinnabar in your palm,
And in the wilderness, a hundred birds will gather to pay homage.
When crows consume it, they become phoenixes;
When serpents consume it, they become dragons.
Those who ingest it attain longevity,
And endure as long as heaven and earth.

It gathers the hun and po souls,
Reverses aging to restore youth,
And summons the Jade Maiden and Jade Youth to serve the medicine.
Within it, forty-nine kinds reside in the Cinnabar Field,
While fourteen others transmute into copper, iron, gold, silver, and the like.

These do not pertain to the great Dao’s reckoning,
And thus are listed hereafter.
Each has its proper use and destination.
Yet the world fails to comprehend,
So they are compiled here for those who seek to refine the Returned Elixir.
Should one employ these substances,
The elixir will never be achieved—
Such is the inherent nature of their origin.

Master Li imparted the Dao to Liu An, Prince of Huainan, saying:
"From the Great Void they descend,
These five metals and eight minerals, fixed in their essence.
Only by discerning their numinous union with the divine principle
Can one truly grasp their inherent nature.
The foolish and deluded must never be taught these secrets,
For the gods will diminish their allotted span,
And calamity will extend to their descendants."

The *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talismans* states: "Those who share the same master receive the teachings, sealed within a golden mouth and golden casket. Though worth a thousand in gold, not one in ten thousand shall lose them."

The *Song of the Five Metals* says:
"With a purple river chariot at home,
Gold fills my house.
If blessed with fortune’s favor,
Ten thousand generations shall know glory."

The *Eulogy on the Five Metals* declares:
"Sulfur can transmute—
This medicine is no empty claim.
Though it plays no part in the Returned Elixir,
It appears in ancient formulary books."

It further states: "Orpiment, too, may transmute,
Yet it does not belong to the reckoning of the Great Returned Elixir."
Why does it not belong? Because it serves another purpose.
This orpiment, refined nine times, yields the Elixir—
Do not dismiss it, for it holds its own art.

I possess one hundred and twenty-six varieties of metals and minerals.

The *Song of the Great Returned Elixir* says:
"White Horse’s Teeth, fine cinnabar,
The double eights of Mao and You unite as one.
Know the above and below,
Refine the Three Flowers fiercely—
A single *dao-gui* will surely win you praise."

This Way is transmitted in succession, each step revered.
Only when the gods reveal its meaning
Does one grasp the difficulty of seeking the Great Dao.
If you fathom the root of the Great Dao,
Seal your lips and hide it in a golden casket.

Alas, the people of this world are foolish and deluded,
Unable to perceive its meaning.
The Way is not distant—
Yet they pore over formulary books,
Studying the dregs of the ancients,
And so achieve nothing.
Called the lowest stream,
They mistake herbs for true medicine,
Failing to grasp its essence—
Thus they never succeed.

How do we know this?
For the song says:
"Fear not the medicine lacks sanctity,
Only that it lacks rectitude.
Fear not the medicine lacks numinosity,
Only that it lacks authenticity.
If the medicine is true and correct,
It will surely be divine and sacred."

When one comprehends its meaning,
Such a person is attuned to the numinous—
What worry then that the Great Dao will not be achieved?

The Lord of the Nine Heavens says:
"The water of the south,
The metal of the north,
Yin dwelling within yang,
Yang dwelling within yin.
Undiscerned in their comings and goings,
Now floating, now sinking.
Years pass, seasons turn,
Together they rest, entwined.
Such are the secret words of the Golden Elixir."

Lead and mercury, the two yin,
Are the heart of the Returned Elixir.
Without encountering the Dao,
One wastes a thousand in gold.
Let the awakened ponder this:
When water and earth meet,
Presence and absence interpenetrate,
Immortals and sages seek one another.
Hold fast to this subtle truth,
And know the Way’s profound depths.

On Mount Emei, the Yellow Emperor transmitted the *Three-One Method* to the Sovereign:
"Let the heart not wander, and the spirit will be at peace;
Let the hun and po submit, and ghosts will find no foothold.
When the supreme medicine is achieved, the Dao becomes mysterious;
Frost and snow congeal, preserving ten thousand years.
The fire of the sun blazes, soaring to the nine heavens—
Not in talismans or hidden transformations is perfection found.
After a thousand days of refinement, old and young regain their visage;
Within, guard the One, the heart’s inch questioned.
Without, seek the external vision to attain life’s difficulty—
The three grades of the Elixir are words of wondrous subtlety.
Attain the One True, and there is no duality;
Receive my method, and heaven and earth are whole.
The immortal path is before your eyes—
Unattached, depart from the world.
Follow the dharma’s power, speak not of it;
Discourse on the Dao everlastingly, for it is the fixed origin.
Rely on the supreme medicine, and all the Dao is mysterious;
Yin and yang in harmonious union give birth to endless continuity.
When fetal breathing is achieved, the image’s law draws near;
When the medicine is preserved, the heart is serene.
The white liquid gold—speak not of prohibitions;
If you attain it, you shall merge with the Great Mystery.
Day and night, ponder it to preserve your life whole—
Such fortune shall ascend to the nine heavens."

The *Song of Master Yang*:
"Expending spirit all day in empty talk
Is not as good as returning to fetal breathing.
Unbroken and ceaseless, the Dao flows of itself;
The Seven Primes and Three Elders all arise from this work.
My true self neither west nor east,
But when cultivating, let your intent know no bounds.
Ever let your body within be like a gentle breeze.
People see one but do not recognize one;
Each time they visualize, a spirit departs.
They know only to focus the mind on one thing,
Unaware that with each day, they diminish.
I urge you to cultivate the true—know what is true!
People ask about Daoist books, but many lead astray.
Unfurling charts and performing rites only disturb the spirit;
Such methods cannot preserve the body’s omen.
Alas! Some are close yet do not draw near—
Bright pearls sink into mud and dust."

The *Song of the Great Returned Elixir of Golden Liquid*:
"The true qi of the north is the river chariot,
The jia and yi of the east yield golden sand.
The two natures nurture, returning to the One;
The Vermilion Bird’s regulation gives birth to golden flowers.
Golden flowers arise—the treasure of heaven and earth!
Those who grasp these words know the true and supreme Dao.
You are the tiger, Mao is the dragon;
Dragon and tiger beget one another, naturally uniting.
The dragon dwells in the zhen position, corresponding to eight;
The tiger’s primordial birth resides in the palace of one.
There is a day to gather, a time to take—
People use it daily yet remain unaware.
Collect the qi and seasons without error,
Or all your efforts will be in vain.
Supremely divine and sacred, yet utterly simple—
Seek the crucible in the central palace.
Temper the fire and seasons, discern yin and yang;
Arrange the furnace chamber, choose the proper ground.
Without the right ground, do not act rashly.
It must be secluded, firmly guarded."

Guard it closely, be cautious—lose not the celestial mechanism,
For this elixir’s transformations are beyond all conception.
True yang sand, true yin mercury—
People seek them yet act recklessly.
Without form, without birth, this is the Reverted Elixir;
Common mercury, common cinnabar—do not trouble with them.
If you encounter this formula and grasp these words,
Refine it, ingest it, and become a true immortal.

Heaven and earth give birth to the yellow sprout,
Water essence congeals into sand.
Two things, yet one body—
Worldly affairs are as tangled as hemp.
The kingly qi ascends in the West,
Yet the Dao is attained in the Central Land.
If you fail to grasp these words,
A thousand efforts, ten thousand labors—all in vain.
