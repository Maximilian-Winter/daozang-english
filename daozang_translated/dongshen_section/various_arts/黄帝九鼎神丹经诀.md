**Scroll One of *The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon: Instructions and Secrets***

The Yellow Emperor received the supreme Dao of the Returning Elixir from **Xuannü** (玄女, the Mysterious Lady).
**Xuannü** is a celestial maiden.
The Yellow Emperor combined and ingested it, thereby ascending to immortality.

**Xuannü** instructed the Yellow Emperor:
*"Those who seek longevity but cannot obtain the Divine Elixir or Golden Liquid merely torment themselves in vain.
Though one may practice breathing techniques—expelling the old and drawing in the new—and ingest herbal medicines, it may extend one’s years but not escape death.
The Divine Elixir grants one the Dao of the Immortal Sage, harmonizing with the heavens and earth, sharing the luminosity of the sun and moon, gazing upon the ten thousand miles, commanding ghosts and spirits, elevating one’s entire family to the Void, flying without wings, riding clouds and dragons, ascending and descending the **Taqing** (太清, Supreme Purity), traversing the eight extremes between the **Loucang** (漏刻, moments marked by water clocks) and beyond, unconstrained by rivers, unfearing of a hundred poisons."*

The Yellow Emperor passed this on to **Xuanziji** (玄子, the Mysterious Son), solemnly declaring:
*"This Dao is most weighty; it must be entrusted only to the worthy.
Even if one possesses mountains of gold or dominion over ten thousand miles, do not reveal this Dao unless the recipient is truly the one.
One who has attained even a single **Cauldron** (鼎) is sufficient for immortality; why need nine?"*

The method of transmission was as follows:
*"A golden figure weighing nine *liang* (两), and a golden fish weighing three *liang*, must be cast into flowing eastern waters as an oath. Both the figure and the fish shall emerge from the one receiving the Dao."*

Before the ritual, one must fast and bathe, setting up a seat for **Xuannü** upon the water in a secluded, uninhabited place.
Burning incense and offering white libations, one declares:
*"I wish to transmit the Dao of Longevity to a certain individual, and place the Elixir Canon upon the seat.
Now, I desire to join this Dao."*

Facing north, one must prostrate oneself for the duration of a **shi** (时, double-hour).
If the sky is clear and the wind still, the transmission may proceed.
Upon receiving the Dao, one must drink the blood of a white rooster as a pledge, and also receive the oral instructions for combining the elixir, as well as cast the golden figure and golden fish into the water.
Those without the **bone of the Immortal Sage** (神仙骨), even numbering ten million, shall never see this Dao.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"To combine the Divine Elixir, one must seek the depths of mountains and great marshes, or the solitude of remote villages and barren wilderness.
If one must do so among people, it must be within high walls and thick barriers, ensuring that none from within or without can see.
The companions assisting should not exceed two or three."*

Beforehand, one must fast for seven days, bathe in fragrant waters, and maintain absolute purity.
One must avoid visiting households that have experienced impurity, death, or marriage.
The Yellow Emperor said:
*"To purchase divine medicines, one must first fast for seven days, bathing on the **Zi-Chou** (子丑) days, and buying them on the **Jǐ** (执) days.
One must sit in the **Yuededi** (月德地, Virtuous Moon Earth), refraining from contention over rank or status."*

**Xuannü** said:
*"The best days for refining medicines are the **Fifth of the Fifth Moon** (五月五日, Great Yang) and the **Seventh of the Seventh Moon** (七月七日).
The most auspicious days begin with **Jiazi** (甲子), **Dingwei** (丁巳), and **Kaichu** (开除) days, followed by **Jiaxian** (甲申), **Yiwei** (乙巳), and **Yimao** (乙卯) days.
The prohibited days for refining medicines are:*
- *Spring: **Wuxin** (戊辰) and **Jii** (己巳)*
- *Summer: **Dingwei** (丁巳), **Wuxian** (戊申), **Renxin** (壬辰), and **Jiyou** (己未)*
- *Autumn: **Wuxu** (戊戌) and **Xinhao** (辛亥), **Gengzi** (庚子)*
- *Winter: **Wuyin** (戊寅), **Jiyou** (己未), **Gui Mao** (癸卯), and **Guiyou** (癸酉)*
*Additionally, the days of **Yue Sha** (月杀, Moon Killing), **Zhi Tianji** (支天季, Heavenly Season of the Branches), **Four Meng Zhongji** (四孟仲季, Mid-Season of the Four Beginnings), **Yue Shou** (月收, Moon Collecting), **Renwu** (壬午), **Bingxu** (丙戌), **Guihao** (癸亥), and **Xinwei** (辛巳), as well as all **Yue Jian** (月建, New Moon) and **Zhu Wang** (朔望, Full Moon) days are inauspicious.
*One must not use these days to kindle fires or refine the Divine Elixir."*

One must be cautious not to converse with the vulgar or associate with ignorant, gossipy, or untrustworthy individuals who do not believe in the Dao.
If such people hear of it, the divine medicine shall fail to manifest.

Once the divine medicine is perfected, one becomes a **True Person** (真人), able to ascend to the heavens or descend into the depths, to transform and vanish at will, and to elevate one’s entire family to immortality—why limit oneself to a single body?

The vulgar covet wealth and do not combine the elixir, nor do they trust in herbal medicines.
For herbs and woods, when buried, they rot; when boiled, they decay; when burned, they char.
How can they, which do not even sustain themselves, sustain others?
They may only treat illnesses and nourish the **qi**, yet still cannot escape death.

The essential secrets of the supreme Dao of the Returning Elixir are not common knowledge.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"When kindling the fire, one must perform a sacrifice at the cauldron’s edge.
Use fine white wine, five *sheng* (升);
dried beef and mutton, three *jin* (斤) each;
yellow millet rice, two *sheng*;
large dates, three *sheng*;
pears, one *dou* (斗);
boiled chicken eggs, thirty in number;
three crucian carp, each weighing three *jin*.
All offerings must be placed in three tables, and each table must contain two cups.
Burn incense and bow twice."*

The Master of Rituals said:
*"Your humble servant [Name], a minor Daoist adept, sincerely invokes the Great Dao Lord, the Old Lord, and the Lord of Great Harmony.
On this day, your humble servant [Name], greedy for life and enamored with the Dao, commands that the elixir not ascend nor perish—all must be subdued by fire.

When the elixir is refined and pure, it transforms with each touch: yellow and white, all suppressed. Upon consuming the elixir, one ascends as an immortal, attending the Purple Palace, with life prolonged boundlessly, attaining the Supreme True Person.

The ritual of wine invocation is complete; twice more I bow. All red fruits, woods, tangerines, and pomelos are offered in full, then fire is kindled as prescribed.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*'To craft the Divine Elixir, first prepare the Mysterious Yellow.
The method for Mysterious Yellow: Take ten *jin* (斤) of quicksilver, twenty *jin* of lead, and place them in an iron vessel. Fiercely subject them to fire below, and the lead and quicksilver will emit their refined essence—purple as violet or golden as yellow gold.

With an iron spoon, collect and name it Mysterious Yellow.
It is also called Yellow Essence, Yellow Sprout, and Yellow Light.
Now, place the substance in a bamboo tube and subject it to a hundred steams. Then, with Realgar and Cinnabar water, mix and let it ascend. The Realgar and Cinnabar water are found in *The Thirty-Six Waters*.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*'Again, prepare the Six-One Mud.
The method for mud: Use alum, martial salt, brine, and gypsum—four substances. First, roast them. For twenty days, command the left-facing oysters of the Eastern Sea, the red stone pitch, and the talc.
In total, seven substances, divided by measure.
The quantities are at one’s discretion; pound them with ten thousand mortars until they become fine as powder.
In an iron vessel, combine and wrap them, then subject to fire for nine days and nine nights.
Fiercely apply the fire below; the elixir turns a true red, like flame.
Pound it again with ten thousand mortars, sift through silk, and blend with the hundred-day flower pool to make mud.
When ready, open it.

Use the mud to coat an earthenware cauldron, ensuring it can hold eight or nine *sheng* (升), or up to one *dou* (斗) for larger ones.
Apply the coating so that both inside and outside are three *fen* (分) thick.
When complete, place it in the midday sun for ten days, until it is thoroughly dry.
Then take orpiment and roast it, until it is golden in hue.
Take the earlier Mysterious Yellow in equal measure, blend with the hundred-day flower pool, and coat the earthenware cauldron inside and out to three *fen* thick. Expose it for ten days, until fully dry.
Then it may be used to refine the elixir’s essence.

Another method: When the elixir vessel and Six-One Mud are prepared, place the lid inside and dry it in the shade. The vessel should be three or four *chi* (尺) above the ground, ensuring it does not become damp.
The first—The Divine Elixir is called *Danhua*.
Its preparation requires true sand—one *jin*.
Or it may be two *jin*.
Or it may be ten *jin*."*

「The quantity is flexible, according to one’s wealth or poverty.
Place it within the cauldron.
Cover it with brine and pound it.
Coat the cauldron’s mouth with Six-One Mud, ensuring no leakage occurs.
Carefully observe it—do not let any cracks form like hair, for then all the elixir’s essence will scatter and fly away.
Only the dregs will remain, which are useless to consume.
Once coated, dry it for a few days, then it may be used.
If not thoroughly dry, it must not be heated.

First, ignite it with *Mǎtōng* husks.
Five *cùn* (寸) from the cauldron, warm it for nine days and nine nights, then fan the flames toward it, again for nine days and nine nights.
Next, place a fire-bag around the cauldron’s midsection for nine days and nine nights.
In total, this spans thirty-six days.
Then cease the fire for one day, allowing the elixir’s essence to rise and cling above—like five-colored *lánggān* (琅玕) or a shooting star, or like frost and snow, or pure red like cinnabar, or green or purple.
Sweep it down with a *péng* (朋) brush; for every *jīn* (斤), it yields only four *liǎng* (两) of refined essence.
If the elixir does not submit to the fire, it must be made to fly again.
Mix it with *Xuánshuǐ* (玄水) essence and *Lónggāo* (龙膏) dew, blending thoroughly until moist.
Then place it once more in a *Xuánhuáng* (玄黄) cauldron, sealing the mouth as before.
Apply fierce flames and make it fly.
After thirty-six days, the elixir is complete.
In all, the process takes seventy-two days.

To consume the elixir, one must observe five to seven days of fasting, purification, and bathing, then burn incense.
At dawn, facing east, kneel and bow in reverence before taking it—like a grain of *dàshǔsù* (大黍粟), or perhaps like a small bean.

The refined adept, upon consuming it, ascends to Heaven in seven days.
The mediocre adept attains immortality in seventy days.
The foolish mortal achieves transcendence in a year.

This *Danhua* (丹华) essence, the second elixir refined by the cauldron’s flight,
along with the Nine Elixirs and all divine elixirs, is supremely beneficial.

*Xuánnǚ* (玄女) says:
When the *Danhua* (丹华) is complete, test it by making gold.
If gold forms, the elixir is complete.
If gold does not form, the elixir is not complete.
An unrefined elixir cannot be consumed.
This failure may stem from either an imperfect cauldron coating or violating prohibitions.

Recheck the earlier flight method.
If a *Lónggāo* (龙膏) pill the size of a small bean is formed,
place it in fierce flames, blow it with a bellows for a short time—it will immediately become poor gold.
Again, take twenty-four *zhū* (铢) of *Danhua* (丹华) essence
and mix it with one *jīn* (斤) of powdered mercury—it will also form yellow gold.
If yellow gold is made, use it to fill a container for the elixir;
or take one *zhū* (铢) of *Danhua* (丹华) essence
and add it to one *jīn* (斤) of mercury, or one *jīn* (斤) of lead.
Apply strong flames and gradually blow it fiercely—all will become yellow gold.

The ratio of *jīn* (斤) to *zhū* (铢) must be precise; do not exceed it,
for then the gold will be hard and unyielding.
Do not reduce it,
for then the gold will be soft and malleable—
both results will fail to withstand hammering.

It is also said:
If gold forms, the world can be transformed.
If gold does not form, life cannot be sustained.
All efforts are wasted—what protection is there in the outcome?

*(Annotations: *Dàshǔsù* (大黍粟) = large millet grain; *Lánggān* (琅玕) = a type of precious stone; *Mǎtōng* (马通) = a plant used in alchemical fire; *Xuánnǚ* (玄女) = a mythical female alchemical deity; *Péng* (朋) = a brush for sweeping; *Fen* (分), *Chi* (尺), *Cùn* (寸), *Jīn* (斤), *Liǎng* (两), *Zhū* (铢) = traditional units of measurement.)*

The second **Divine Elixir** is named **Divine Seal**.

Take **mercury** without toxicity.
Adjust its quantity as needed and place it within a **six-to-one clay furnace** (六一泥釜), seal it tightly, and dry it thoroughly—just as when refining **Dan Hua** (丹华).

Fly it nine times; when the **upper and lower coldness** (上下寒) appears, sweep and gather it, blending with **carp bile** (鲤鱼胆).
Reseal and coat it as before, then fly it again nine times.
When the **upper and lower coldness** (上下寒) appears once more, sweep and gather it, blending with **Dragon Tallow** (龙膏).
This is called **Divine Seal**.

Take **ten catties of lead** (铅) and **Dan Hua** (黄华), measure it into a vessel, and heat it with **charcoal fire** (炭火).
Then take **seven catties of mercury** (水银) and pour it into the lead.
Apply fierce fire for a brief moment—its essence will rise and emerge,
in form like **yellow gold** (黄金), yet also resembling a **falling star** (流星).
Purple-red droplets flow like pearls;
five-colored **mysterious yellow** (玄黄) radiance.
Use an **iron spoon** (铁匙) to collect it.
If you obtain ten catties, it will refine into **Nine Transformations** (九转).
This is called **Yellow of Dan Hua** (丹华之黄),
also known as **Liquid of Mysterious Yellow** (玄黄之液) and **Seal of Heaven and Earth** (天地之符).

Then pound and refine the **mercury** (汞), transforming it into an elixir,
which is named **Returning Elixir** (还丹).
The **Sages** (圣人) keep it concealed.
It is not known by ordinary Daoist practitioners (凡俗道士),
nor by those of uncommon insight (殊达者) unless they truly understand.

Fire is named **Zǐmíng** (子明).
Mercury is also named **Zǐmíng**.
One is the essence of lead—
also called **Tàiyín** (太阴),
**Jīngōng** (金公), **Héchē** (河车),
**Chāinǚ** (姹女), or **Lìzhìshí** (立制石).

The ignorant in their craft simply use **Lìzhìshí** from the mountains—
this is incorrect.
The **True Ones** (真人) say:
*"All stone bile comes from lead.*
The foolish masses, refining divine medicines,
wrongly use **Qiānglǐ stone bile**—
this is false, a path diverging ten thousand *lǐ* from the Dao.
Because of this, the medicine fails."*

The **True Ones** say:
*"Refine cinnabar essence into flowing pearl frost,
lead essence into **Returning Elixir** (还丹),
and **yellow-white** (黄白) perfection is achieved—
take it, and you become a transcendent immortal.
Without these two substances, even if the medicine attains elixir form,
taking it is still akin to awaiting death."*

**Tàiyín** is lead; **Tàiyáng** is cinnabar.
Take nine *jīn* of mercury and one *jīn* of lead,
place them together in a red-earth crucible,
and apply fierce fire from midday until noon the next day.

Some say:
*"At the hour of **shuì** (巳, 11 AM–1 PM),
mercury and lead essence both emerge,
golden in hue—
named **Huángjīng** (黄精),
also **Huángyá** (黄芽),
**Huángqīng** (黄轻),
and **Huánghuá** (黄华).
Boil it with **jǐnghuá water** (井华水),
and it is called **Huánghuá Pool** (黄华池),
also **Huánglóng** (黄龙),
**Huángfú** (黄服),
or **Lìzhìshí** again.*

Take **mysterious yellow** (玄黄) and mix it with **mysterious water essence** (玄水液),
knead it into pills like sealing wax,
and place them in a red-earth crucible,
sealing with **liùyī mud** (六一泥) three *fēn* thick inside and out.
Let it dry for ten days without leakage.
Burn it with **Mǎtōng** (马通) or husk fuel for eighty days—
the **golden medicine** will then be complete.

Take one *dāojī* (刀圭) of **mysterious yellow**,
place it in fierce fire, and blow it with a bellows for the time it takes to eat a meal—
it will all dissolve into **gold**.

If the gold does not form, the medicine remains raw and cannot be used.
Return it to the red-earth crucible,
reseal it with sealing wax,
and fire it again for eighty days—
only then may the medicine be taken.

**Mysterious yellow** is also called **Fúdān** (伏丹) or **Zǐfěn** (紫粉).
To take it, do so on a **jiǎzǐ day** (甲子) at dawn,
facing south, bowing twice with knees bent,
swallowing one pill the size of a small bean daily.
After a hundred days, you will become immortal,
all ailments cured—
even severe madness and leprosy vanish,
and there is no plague you cannot overcome.

Then take the **hundred-day Huá Pool** (百日华池),
mix it with **mysterious yellow** into a paste,
and place it in a red-earth crucible,
sealing inside and out with three *fēn* of mud.
Add one *jīn* of mercury—
or up to ten *jīn*—
as much medicine as desired.
Three *jīn* suffice for one immortal.

Extract ten *liǎng* of **mysterious yellow essence**,
take three *jīn* of mercury,
place it in an earthen crucible,
cover it with **mysterious yellow** two *cùn* thick,
seal it with another crucible,
and bind it with **liùyī mud**,
ensuring no leakage.
Expose it to the sun until thoroughly dry,
then fire it.

If it is damp, do not fire—
heat will cause it to crack.
Follow the method for refining **Danhuá** (丹华):
burn with **Mǎtōng** husk fuel for nine days and nights,
then rest it for one day.
When opened, the medicine will rise like frost on the crucible—
purple, crimson, vermilion, and green radiance,
two *fēn* thick.
Sweep it down with feathers,
mixing it with **yellow dog bile**—
or **Hébó’s leftover fish bile**—
as the secret says:
*"This is **crucian carp bile**."*

Some say:
*"Knead this **mysterious yellow** into sealing wax."*

The note says:
*"The substance used for pill-making is **water from springs**."*

Reseal and return it to the crucible,
covering it with **mysterious yellow** one *cùn* thick.
Some say:
*"Seal the crucible tightly,
bind it with **liùyī mud** as before,
expose it to the sun for ten days until fully dry—
do not fire if damp.
Once heated, the crucible will crack."*

Refine it again for nine days and nights,
then rest it for one day.
When opened, sweep down the rising essence—
if only purple, it is called **Shénfú Huándān** (神符还丹).
Mix it with **lónggāo** (龙膏) into bean-sized pills.

Take them daily at dawn on a **jiǎzǐ day**,
facing south, bowing twice with knees bent.
After a hundred days, you will meet immortals,
**Yùnǚ** (玉女) will come to you,
and you will ascend with the gods, flying through the skies.

To cross great waters,
mix **Shénfú** with **lónggāo**,
or apply **Hébó’s bile** to your feet—
you will walk upon the water without sinking.

To enter fire,
take one pill, and you will feel no heat.

After a hundred days of taking the medicine,
the **Three Corpses and Nine Worms** (三尸九虫) will self-destruct,
granting eternal life.

---
**The Third Divine Elixir** is called **Shéndān** (神丹).

First, coat the inside and outside of two red-earth crucibles
with **liùyī mud**, three *fēn* thick each.

Take **mǔlì** (牡蛎), **chìshízhī** (赤石脂), and **císhí** (磁石)—
if no magnetite is available, retain the original text unchanged.
Divide these three substances equally,
pestle them ten thousand times into powder.
Mix with **hundred-day Huá Pool** until moistened.

Some say:
*"Place it in a straight crucible,
coat the inner surface,
then apply **mysterious yellow essence** on top,
one *cùn* thick."*

Take two *jīn* of **Dìnán** (帝男, realgar) and one *jīn* of **Dìnǚ** (帝女, orpiment).
First, moisten them with **hundred-day Huá Pool**,
then grind them in an iron mortar ten thousand times
until they become powder.
Place them in the crucible,
cover with **yellow powder** one *cùn* thick,
seal it with another crucible,
and bind it with **liùyī mud**—
ensure no **qi** escapes.
Let it dry for ten days.

Then burn it with **Mǎtōng** husk fuel for nine days and nights,
keeping the fire five *cùn* from the crucible’s edge.
Use a fire-pusher to surround it for nine days and nights.
Push the fire inward until it reaches the crucible’s center,
then apply fierce flame to its lower half for nine days and nights—
a total of thirty-six days.
Rest it for one day.

With a feather, sweep away the flying essence adhering above, then mix it with **Dragon Fat** and introduce it into the crucible.
Seal it again with mud, dry it, and fire it for another thirty-six days.
*Some say*: twenty-seven days.
Then, after cooling it for one day, open it—the flying essence will adhere above. This is called **Flying Essence**; those who refine it call it **Divine Elixir**.

The superior adept, taking one *dāo* of it daily for fifty days, becomes a transcendent.
The mediocre adept requires a hundred days; the foolish, a year—then they too become transcendent.
Even common men, women, children, slaves, and livestock who ingest it shall become immortal and never die.
It wards off the Five Weapons; when worn as an amulet, it guards against all calamities.

After taking the elixir for a hundred days, all transcendent beings will come to welcome them—**Yùnán** (玉男), **Yùnǚ** (玉女), **Yùntóng** (玉童)—along with mountain marshals and marshals of the marshes, appearing in human form.
The method depends on one’s own cultivation; it is not inherited.

---
**Fourth Divine Elixir**, called **Returning Elixir**:
Take **alum stone**, **yellow ore**, **red earth**, **martial salt**, **oysters**, **red stone pitch**, **earth dragon arrow**, **mica**, and **soapstone**—nine substances in total.
Burn each for one day and night with fierce flame, then grind them separately until powdered.
Mix with **Left Elixir** until it resembles mud.
Place in a crucible one *cùn* deep, adding one *jīn* of **mercury**.
Then layer **realgar**, **copper acetate**, **alum stone**, **yellow pitch**, **saltpetre**, **Yǔyúliáng** (禹余粮, "Yu’s surplus grain"), and **alum stone** again, with **yellow ore** on top and **mercury** alone at the bottom—seven substances in total, each ground separately into powder.
Place the **mercury** (one *jīn*) alone at the bottom, then layer the rest in order.
Seal the crucible with **Left Elixir** and **liùyī mud**, drying it for ten days.
Place it on three iron tripods, nine *cùn* high, and fire it with **Mǎtōng** husk fuel, keeping the flame five *cùn* from the crucible’s base.
Let the fire burn for nine days and nights until it reaches the crucible’s center.
Then increase the flame to the crucible’s midpoint for another nine days and nights.
Constantly dampen the crucible’s surface with a wet cloth to prevent the medicine from dispersing.
When the cloth dries, rewet it.
After eighty-one days, cool it for one day, then open it—the medicine will rise as five-colored vapors, adhering to the crucible’s lid. This is the **Flying Method**, the essence of the alchemy.

Sweep the vapors with a **parrot’s feather**, mix them with **hundred herbs’ flowers**, and dissolve in **well-bloom water** to ingest.
After a hundred days, a **crimson bird** and **phoenix** will hover above, and divine beings and **Yùnǚ** will arrive.
After two hundred days, one can ascend to heaven or descend to earth, with transcendent beings attending.
After a year, **Tàiyī** (太一) will welcome them in a **cloud chariot** drawn by dragons.

Those who take this elixir will never feel hunger or thirst and will live a hundred years.
They may drink from **stone springs**, eat twenty **dates and chestnuts**, and consume five *cùn* of **dried meat**.

Moreover, if **Returning Elixir** is used to inscribe **amulets**, the money will return on its own when used in trade.
If written on a **target’s frame**, all ghosts will flee in terror.
Additionally, if one *dāo* of the elixir is mixed with powdered **mercury** (one *jīn*) and fired, it instantly becomes **true gold**.
*Another method*: mix the medicine with **Dragon Fat** and fire it for nine days and nights to produce genuine gold.

---
**Fifth Divine Elixir**, called **Nourishing Elixir**:
Take one *jīn* of **mercury** and place it in a **liùyī crucible**.
Add one *jīn* of **realgar**, ground into powder, layering it over the mercury.
Then add one *jīn* of **Yǔyúliáng**, ground into powder, layering it over the realgar.
Seal the crucible’s rim with **liùyī mud**, dry it, and fire it with **Mǎtōng** husk fuel for nine days and nights.
Then switch to **charcoal fire**, burning for another nine days and nights.
After cooling for one day, open it—the medicine will rise as frost-like vapors, adhering to the lid.
Sweep it with a feather, mix with **Dragon Fat** and **Shàoshì Tiānxióng** (少室天雄, "Heavenly Tiger of Shao Mountain") in equal parts—*or* **parrot blood**—into *dāo* doses.
Taking one *dāo* daily for thirty days grants **feathered ascension**; myriad spirits will attend, and **Yùnǚ** may be summoned.
Transcendent beings will welcome them to ascend to heaven.
Even **ghosts, ancestral spirits, and wind/rain deities** will come to serve them.

---
**Sixth Elixir**, called **Refined Elixir**:
Take eight stones to forge it.
The eight stones are: **Bāyuè cinnabar**, **realgar**, **orpiment** (ground to fly), **copper acetate**, **alum stone**, **yellow ore**, **stone gall**, and **lodestone**—eight substances in equal parts, ground separately into powder and mixed with **earth dragon fat**.
Take two *shāng* of **earth dragon arrow**, combined with **yellow dog’s liver and gall**, forming the crucible.
Grind **oysters** and **red stone pitch** (three *jīn* each) into powder.
Mix with **Left Elixir** to form mud, coating the crucible’s interior and exterior, three *fēn* thick, and dry it.
*Another method*: adjust the proportions freely, using **earth dragon fat** and one *shāng* of **earth dragon arrow**, mixed with **yellow dog’s gall**, then two *shāng* of **earth dragon arrow**, along with powdered **oysters** and **red stone pitch**, forming mud to coat the crucible’s interior and exterior, three *fēn* thick, and dry it.

Layer the eight stones in powdered form: **cinnabar** at the bottom, then **realgar**, **orpiment**, **copper acetate**, **alum stone**, **yellow ore**, **stone gall**, and **lodestone** on top.
Seal the crucible with **liùyī mud** at the rim, drying it as before.
Fire it with **Mǎtōng** husk fuel for thirty-six days.
After cooling for one day, open it—the medicine will rise as frost-like vapors, adhering to the lid.
Sweep it with a feather, mix with **Dragon Fat**, and pill into **small mung bean** sizes.
Take one pill daily after meals; in ten days, one becomes transcendent.
Ghosts and spirits will attend and obey.

It can also be used to forge gold.
Not only men—women too may ascend as immortals.
If one wishes to abstain from grains, let them always refrain from sexual intercourse, drinking only water and avoiding all contact.

This elixir’s dregs can cure a hundred ailments.
Another method: fuse lead to make gold, then refine it into elixir. Combine one *jin* of mercury with *dāo guī* (male and female minerals), and fire it until gold forms.

Some say *soft cinnabar* resembles *refined elixir*—smooth, glossy, and easy to ingest.

**The Seventh Elixir, called Soft Cinnabar:**
Take three *jin* of mercury, mix it with *zuǒwèi* (left mineral) and *Xuányuán* (primordial yellow) into a paste, then coat the inside and outside of an earthen crucible, three *fēn* thick each.
Place the mercury inside a crucible, seal the rim with *liùyī* mud, and dry it for ten days.
Then fire it, following the *Tàidān Huá* method, for thirty-six days.
After cooling for one day, open it—the vapors will rise like frost on the crucible’s lid. Sweep them with a feather, mix with *Dragon Fat*, and take as *small mung bean* pills, three daily, to become immortal and deathless.

If mixed with *dízhì* (antimony juice), a ninety-year-old man who takes it for twenty days will turn his white hair black, strengthening his *yang* essence and *yin* qi. Even with intercourse, he will father countless children.

With *soft cinnabar*, one may draw on *wu tong* wood to create living figures.
Writing characters with it ensures slaves will never flee.
An eighty-year-old woman who takes it will bear children.
A high-ranking official who takes it will be promoted.

With lead, combine it by fire to form gold and silver, another name being *Huángjīn* (Yellow Gold).
The eighth elixir is called *Fù Dān* (Suppressed Elixir).
Its hue is dark purple, like a five-colored radiance.

Take one *catty* of mercury, or even more.
Use *Xuányuán Huá* (Dark Yellow Flower) to refine the earthen crucible, making its interior and exterior each three *fen* thick.
Then add *dízhì* (antimony juice), *zéng qīng* (magnetite), and *cǐshí* (lodestone), grinding them into powder.
Apply the *Xuányuán Huá* to the crucible, then layer the powders of *zéng qīng* and *cǐshí* over the mercury.
Seal it with another crucible, coat the junction with *Liùyī* (Six-One) mud, and dry it for ten days.
Then ignite it with *Mǎtōng* (horse-dung) charcoal fire for nine days and nights.
Turn the upper crucible to become the lower one, and fire it again for nine days and nights.
Repeat this process, alternating upper and lower crucibles, nine times in total before stopping.
Cool it for one day, then open it—sweep with a feather to collect what rises and clings to the lid.
Mix with *Dragon Fat*, then return the residue to the crucible and fire it once more for ten days before stopping.
Cool it again for one day, open it, sweep to collect what rises and clings to the lid, and grind it into powder.
Store it in a gold or silver tube, or in a fresh bamboo tube.
At dawn, face the sun with hands bound, bow twice in a long kneeling posture, and swallow one *dāo guī* (knife-shaped dose) in *jǐnghuá* (well-flowered) water—this will make one a Daoist immortal.
If shaped into a pill the size of a date pit and carried in the hand, it banishes one hundred spirits.
If written on doors and thresholds with this *róu Dān* (Soft Elixir), all malevolent spirits, *jiāngmèi* (rogue spirits), and *bìméngliángliáng* (demonic entities) dare not approach.
It also repels thieves and bandits, even tigers and wolves will avoid it.
If a woman guards herself alone and keeps such a pill the size of a large soybean, one hundred spirits and thieves will flee far and not dare to come.

The ninth elixir is called *Hán Dān* (Cold Elixir).
Its method uses a red-earth crucible, coated inside and out with *Liùyī* mud to a thickness of three *fen*, and dried as per the *Dān Huá* (Elixir Flower) method.
Take one *catty* each of *Dì Nán* (Imperial Male—realgar), *Dì Nǚ* (Imperial Female—orpiment), *zéng qīng* (magnetite), *yùshí* (sulfur), and *cǐshí* (lodestone), grinding them separately into powder.
First, apply the *Xuányuán Huá* to the *Liùyī* crucible as per the *Dān Huá* method.
Then place one *catty* of *liúzhū* (sulfur pearls) into the crucible.
Next, layer *Dì Nán* over the *liúzhū*, followed by *Dì Nǚ*, then *zéng qīng*, *yùshí*, and finally *cǐshí* on top.
Seal it with another crucible, coat the junction with *Liùyī* mud to a thickness of three *fen*.
Additionally, mix half a *catty* each of *tǔlóngshǐ* (earth dragon’s arrow—possibly a type of clay or mineral) and yellow soil into a paste.
One alternative method states: coat it with *mǔlì* (oyster shell) and *chìshí zhī* (red stone pitch—possibly cinnabar or red lead) to a thickness of three *fen*.
Then coat it again with *tǔlóngshǐ*.
Expose it to the sun for ten days until it dries.

Now, with gentle fire, first refining with *Wén* (cultivation), then with *Wǔ* (martial/transformation), for nine nights.
On the tenth day, let it cool, then open it and sweep away with feathers what adheres to the top.
Mix with *lónggāo* (dragon fat—possibly a resinous substance) and yellow dog bile, forming pills the size of small beans.
At dawn, with *jǐnghuá* (well-bloom water—water exposed to sunlight), facing the sun and bowing twice, swallow one pill.
This will make the body light, and within a hundred days, all ailments will vanish.
A *yùnǚ* (jade maiden) will attend you, the *sīmìng* (record-keeper of fate) will erase your name from the register of death, and you will be inscribed in the register of immortals.
You may then fly above and below, entering and exiting without hindrance, beyond all constraint.
You may sit and vanish, or rise lightly upon the clouds, ascending to heaven.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon, Volume One, Complete**
**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon, Volume Two: The Origin and Method of Obtaining the Refined Elixir**

The subject reports: The Nine Methods of Returning the Elixir stem from the Nine Heavens’ *Yuándào* (Primordial Dao), the supreme scripture of the Nine Directions.
In ancient times, the True Persons *Wáng Qiāo*, *Chìsōngzǐ*, and the Yellow Emperor received it from *Xuǎnnǚ* (the Mysterious Maiden).
*Xuǎnnǚ* is a celestial maiden.

The first Dao illuminates the True Person’s Way. *Sùnǚ* (the Naked Maiden), the True Person, is the sovereign of the immortals.
As the teacher of Heaven and Earth, her rank is *Zhēnrén* (True Person), and all immortals revere her.
The True Person is born before Heaven and dies after Earth. Water cannot drown them, fire cannot burn them, poison cannot harm them, and weapons cannot injure them.
Their divine transformations are boundless, their will unfettered, and they command the multitudes of immortals without fail.
They discern the essence of spiritual medicines and communicate with the numinous.
Thus the scripture says: “This is the True Person.”

Those who ingest the elixir become immortals, attaining the rank of True Person, even able to summon the Wind Lord and command the Rain Master.

The rank of *xiānrén* (immortal) surpasses a hundred ghosts and subdues ten thousand spirits.
This is achieved through the ingestion of minor elixirs—cloud mother, eight minerals, and herbal medicines.

The *qīngyāo yùnǚ* (green-waisted jade maiden) is the daughter of the Wind Lord, inferior to *Xuǎnnǚ* and *Sùnǚ*.
The *yùnǚ* are mortal women who, upon attaining the Dao, are titled as such and serve as consorts or attendants to immortals.

This *Jiǔdān Jīng* originates from *Wáng Qiāo*, *Chìsōngzǐ*, and the Yellow Emperor receiving it from *Xuǎnnǚ*—not from lesser immortals like myself.

The subject reports: *Gě Hóng* states in the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon*:
“The Yellow Emperor ingested it and thus ascended to Heaven.
If one practices breathing exercises and ingestion of herbal medicines, one may prolong life—but death is still inevitable.
If one ingests the divine elixir, however, one attains boundless longevity, equal to Heaven’s completion.
One may ride the clouds and dragons, ascending and descending the *Tàiqīng* (Great Clarity).”

Thus, the Yellow Emperor transmitted it to *Xuánzǐ* (the Mysterious Sage), who declared:
“This Dao is of utmost importance—it must be passed only to the worthy.
Even if one possesses mountains of gold, do not transmit it to the unworthy.”

Those who receive it must cast a golden man and golden fish into flowing water as an oath, swearing with enemy blood.
Without the bones of an immortal, one cannot even hear or see this Dao.
Those who hear or see it have the fate to possess this Dao.

When refining the elixir, one must seek secluded mountain peaks, places untouched by men, and never gather more than three companions.
First, observe a hundred days of purification, bathe in five-scented waters, and maintain absolute purity—avoid all defilement and contact with commoners or those who doubt the Dao.
For if such persons speak ill of the divine medicine, the elixir will fail.
If successful, the entire household becomes immortal—not just one person.
Commoners should not refine divine elixirs, nor should they rely solely on herbal medicines.
Herbal medicines rot when buried, decay when boiled, char when burned, and decompose when left idle.
How can they, which cannot sustain themselves, sustain a person?
How can they, which cannot fortify themselves, fortify a person?

This Ninefold Elixir is the key to eternal life—beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.

**First Elixir: *Huádān* (Flower Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting this elixir grants immortality in seven days.”
Form pills with *Xuángāo* (mysterious fat) and place them over fierce flames—momentarily, they become yellow gold.
Again, with 240 *shū* (a small weight measure) of this elixir and 100 *jīn* (catty) of mercury, when heated to a red glow, it becomes yellow gold.
If the gold does not form, reseal the medicine and heat it again—when the days are sufficient, the scripture says: “The essence is unformed.”

**Second Elixir: *Shénfú Dān* (Divine Symbol Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting it grants immortality in a hundred days.”
When crossing great waters, anointing the soles with this elixir allows one to walk upon the surface without sinking.
It dispels the *sānshī jiǔchóng* (three corpses and nine pests), and all ailments are cured.

**Third Elixir: *Shéndān* (Divine Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting one *dāoguī* (a measure of elixir) grants immortality in a hundred days.”
Even if swallowed by livestock, they will never age or die.
It also repels the five weapons.
After a hundred days, a *yùnǚ* (jade maiden) will attend you, and mountain spirits and ghosts will regard you in human form.

**Fourth Elixir: *Huándān* (Return Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting one *dāoguī* grants immortality in a hundred days.”
The *zhūquè fènghuáng* (vermilion bird and phoenix) will hover above, and a *yùnǚ* will attend you.
With one *dāoguī*, take 1 *jīn* of mercury and heat it—it instantly becomes yellow gold.
Anointing money or objects with this elixir causes them to return the next day.
Writing this elixir on a mortal’s eyes causes all ghosts to flee in terror.

**Fifth Elixir: *Ēdān* (Nourishment Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting it grants immortality in forty days, with ghosts and spirits attending, and a *yùnǚ* arriving.”

**Sixth Elixir: *Liàndān* (Refined Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting it grants immortality in fifteen days.”
It also, when combined with mercury and fire, becomes yellow gold.

**Seventh Elixir: *Rǔdān* (Soft Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting one *dāoguī* grants immortality in a hundred days.”
When mixed with autumn *fùpén zhī* (mulberry leaf juice) and ingested, even a ninety-year-old man may father children.
When combined with lead and heated, it becomes yellow gold.

**Eighth Elixir: *Fúdān* (Subduing Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting it grants immortality immediately.”

---

With an elixir the size of a date pit worn as an amulet, a hundred ghosts will flee in terror.
If this elixir is inscribed on a door, malevolent spirits dare not approach, and it also repels thieves, bandits, tigers, and wolves.

**Ninth Elixir: *Hándān* (Cold Elixir)**
The scripture says: “Ingesting one *dāoguī* grants immortality in a hundred days, with *yùnǚ* arriving to attend, and the ability to soar and rise lightly.”

The scripture also says: “All nine elixirs, when properly combined into one, will grant immortality.”

It does not matter if they are all made; it depends on what the practitioner desires.
Those who wish to ingest the nine elixirs and ascend to heaven may do so at will, or if they wish to cease human questioning, they may also do so at will—then they can freely enter and exit without harm.

According to my study, the *Jīnyè huándān* (Golden Liquid Return Elixir) method, when combined, requires ingesting one *liǎng* (two *qīán*—a unit of weight) to ascend as an immortal.
If one does not yet wish to leave the mortal realm but instead desires to become a *dìxiān* (Earthly Immortal), they should fast for one hundred days, then ingest half a *liǎng*, and thus attain eternal life without dying, immune to all calamities and poisons, able to keep wife and children.

If one holds an official rank, they may act according to their desires without restriction.
If later they wish to ascend to heaven, they should fast again and ingest the full nine elixirs, completing one *liǎng*, and then immediately soar as an immortal.

All who wish to ascend to heaven must first abstain from grains for over a year before ingesting the elixirs.

According to my further study of the *Zhēnrén Jiǔshēng Jīng* (Scripture of the True Person’s Nine Ascents), those who ingest the nine elixirs to ascend to heaven should follow the prescribed days as in the main scripture.
If one desires to become an Earthly Immortal, they may ingest half the amount, storing the rest—even if stored, they will still attain eternal life without harm, beyond all danger.
Later, if they wish to ascend to heaven, they should ingest the remaining elixirs.

According to these teachings, those who ingest the divine elixirs and great medicines, following the scriptural days, will ascend lightly to heaven.
If they store and ingest half, they will attain eternal life without dying, becoming Earthly Immortals—of this there is no doubt.

I have heard that there are eight reasons why one may fail in cultivating the Dao:
1. They casually learn one technique and claim it sufficient, toiling over tripods and flames, yet never achieving success by the time their hair turns white.
2. Though they seek extraordinary methods, they dismiss them as not true, relentlessly pursuing until they die with their coffin sealed.
3. They cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, study without a master, and lack a fixed resolve—thus wasting time and energy.
4. They rely on their own cleverness, neglecting the true teachings, and arrogantly believe they have already attained the Dao, failing to complete the master’s instructions.
5. The true methods and secrets are not easily seen or encountered; they believe they lie in famous mountains, risking life and limb to seek them.
6. Their family lacks even a single *dàn* (unit of weight) of resources, and hunger and cold press upon them—whether they obtain the methods or not, they know them as little as if they did not.
7. Their nature lacks focus and perseverance, and even after a master has imparted the secrets, they hesitate and do not act.
8. The teachers they encounter are themselves shallow and inferior, begrudgingly imparting only a little, claiming the Dao is scarce, and hoarding precious techniques as if they were true—thus leading to futile waiting like the *shǒuzhū* (one who waits for a fallen gourd).

The Dao does not lie in multiplicity; do not say that minor methods are insignificant, for even within the great elixirs, none surpass the *Jiǔdǐng* (Nine Tripods) Dao, transmitted by the True Person.
The True Person passed it to *Xuányǚ* (玄女), who in turn passed it to *Huángdì* (Yellow Emperor), who obtained it and passed it to *Xuánzǐ* (玄子). From that time onward, those who received the method became True Persons.
I have never heard of True Persons personally instructing others; those who attain it are worthy of esteem.

Later generations valued hearing over seeing, abandoning the near for the distant.
Thus, the First Emperor of Qin saw *Ānpí* (安期) yet lost the Dao,
and the Emperor Wu of Han sought *Shǎojiūn* (少君) without completing the method,
then searched for *Fāngzhàng* (方丈) and crossed the *Cāngbō* (沧波), yet ultimately failed to succeed, vainly striving for honors and rewards.

The skilled seeker does not rely on official appointment,
and the cunning taker does not labor under coercion.

When *Xuānyuán* (轩辕—Yellow Emperor) ruled the world, *Guǎngchéng* (广成) did not assist him, yet his virtuous governance was not diminished.
When *Tángyáo* (唐尧—Emperor Yao) held the Four Seas, *Cháoyóu* (巢由) did not aid him, yet his later virtue was not lacking.

The Four *Hào* (皓) were confined in *Shāngluò* (商洛), yet they did not hinder the Han’s many worthy scholars.
*Zhōudàng* (周党) composed poetry in the woods and marshes, yet it did not diminish the legal measures of Emperor *Xiàowén* (孝文).

The favored and noble could not sway their resolve;
their hearts were tranquil and silent,
their nature loathed flattery and noise,
they feared indulgence and shunned official honors as obstacles.
They lived in humble simplicity, dressed in coarse rags, and wore grass mats instead of fine robes.
They took the fragrant groves as their palaces,
the steep cliffs as their grand halls,
the emerald orchids as their mattresses,
the green leaves as their curtains.
They wore hemp garments instead of decayed silks,
and relied on gourd vines as their fine meals.
They did not till the fields to fill their bellies,
nor did their wives weave to cover their bodies.
They guarded their constancy until death,
despising the Three Joys (of music, women, and fine food),
fearing swift death,
not scheming for mere survival,
rejecting a thousand *jīn* (金) in weighty offers,
ignoring the prestige of high ministers,
free and unrestrained in their ways,
without worldly attachments—
all were praised in their time as noble and lofty.

These men could neither benefit the state above nor aid the people below.
Though the annals of history still speak of their names, they sought only the higher Dao of eternal life.

The art of learning the great methods of divine elixirs,
they refused to enslave their bodies to worldly affairs,
but relied solely on medicinal substances to aid themselves,
so that external calamities could not reach them,
and internal ailments would not arise.
They transformed their aged bodies and altered their forms,
enduring without death for long years,
their spirit undiminished.
They meticulously examined and refined countless techniques,
gaining their efficacy,
judging their merits and demerits,
and always striving to improve.
They despised the vulgarity of the earth,
treating fame as morning dew.
Within the Eight Extremes of existence,
how many would they curse?
Their aspirations were vast,
and their benefits profound.

The pursuit of this craft requires essential tools;
without these few individuals, it cannot be accomplished.
If pressed or coerced, success would not be attained.

When the winds of fame stir, the hearths of recluses grow cold;
when the Way of the Sage-King flourishes, extraordinary men withdraw.
Now the world is at peace, oxen rest, and horses roam free,
the beacon fires lie dormant, arms are sheathed,
the multitudes are subdued, and the world’s labors cease.
Yet, even in such times, men like **Zi Fang** (子房) emerge from their seclusion only to return to ordinary life,
and **Xin Bu** (信布) lay aside their armor to take up fishing and hunting.

Within the universe, few are earnest in their love of this Dao and capable of achieving it—
perhaps not one in ten thousand.

In days of old, the Yellow Emperor donned his ceremonial robes
and governed the world beneath the heavens,
his virtue as radiant as flowing pearls,
transforming frost and snow into dew.
In his era of elevated peace, he entrusted the affairs of state,
and after a hundred and ten years, his Dao was complete—
his body refined, he ascended as a **White Day Immortal**.

This was achieved through the power of **Guangcheng** (广成) and **Xuan Nü** (玄女),
not by mere chance.

In ancient times, the **Hao Wang** (昊王) struck stones to build his palaces,
and within the clefts of those stones, he found a book of purple script on golden tablets.
Unable to read it, he sent his emissary to consult Confucius,
saying: *"Hao Wang, in his leisure, saw a red crane peck at a book,
which he placed before the hall.
He does not know its meaning,
so he sends it far to seek your wisdom."*

Confucius examined the text and declared:
*"This is the **Lingbao** (灵宝) formula,
the method of eternal life,
which the Great Yu consumed,
and thus his lifespan matched the heavens and earth.
As Yu was about to ascend and transform,
he sealed this book within a mountain and stone vault.
Now you say the red crane pecked it—
this must be a heavenly gift."*

Thus it is known that from ancient times,
emperors and kings who eagerly sought eternal life
never failed to live long years.

Even if one searches but does not find,
it is better than not searching at all.
For there are those who, though not seeking,
still achieve it.

One need not fear the absence of the Dao within the heart,
but only that one does not strive diligently.
If one persists without ceasing,
one must attain it.

Again, those who seek the Dao
are like the poor man longing for wealth,
or the lowly desiring noble station—
how could the Dao ever be unattainable?

Yet, they fear their resolve is not steadfast,
pursuing immediate gains while neglecting distant ones.
They rejoice at hearing it and hasten to take their place,
but soon forget it as if it never existed.
Before minor advantages are even fully realized,
great losses have already befallen them.
How then can they hope to exhaust the profound and subtle,
and perfect the Dao after their knowledge has waned?

Even if their resolve is earnest and their efforts tireless,
without encountering a wise teacher,
they cannot succeed.

For those who study the art of eternal life,
the key lies in the elixirs,
and among elixirs, the greatest is the **secret formula**,
the **secret** of divine elixirs.
The Dao is the same, yet the **virtue/power** differs—
one swears to take them together,
and may attain them by righteous means,
but cannot suppress them by force.

In ancient times, the Great Yu did not compel **Bocheng Zi Gao** (伯成子高),
for he honored his superiority.
Confucius did not borrow from **Zixia** (子夏),
for he protected his shortcomings.

Lush fields, shallow waters,
vast wildernesses and hidden marshes,
where foxes and deer roam,
and rugged cliffs and secluded peaks abound—
these are the paths and dwellings of the immortals.
If one were to keep foxes and deer in splendid halls,
they would surely break free.
If one were to dismiss the immortals with high honors,
they would abandon their labors in resentment.

Thus, to study the **orthodox scriptures**,
it is as if one faces a true immortal.
To receive the **true secret formulas**,
it is as if one gains their very essence.

Even if false teachings should come,
and **Anqi** (安期) or **Zhengzi** (争子) arrive with contrary words,
the **orthodox scriptures** and **secret formulas** cannot be fully discarded—
there will always be minor differences.

I humbly pray that the **Sage-Sovereign** (圣主)
will carefully examine and choose the correct path to follow.

I have heard that if one trims the grass in spring,
even the **zhi** (芝, sacred mushrooms) will flourish.
If one disturbs the nests of cranes and phoenixes,
even they will not gather there.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon—Secret Formulas, Volume Two, ends.**
**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon—Secret Formulas, Volume Three, begins.**

To seek the **Dao** with clarity and receive the **secret formulas** without relying on the **True Persons’** methods—
I have heard that a teacher is not always constant, yet one should follow the good and take them as teacher.
Among three walking together, one must follow the virtuous.
Confucius’ **Dao** is unified in its essence.

The **Yellow Emperor** surveyed the methods of the world, seeking nothing he did not investigate.
If the **True Persons’** **Dao** and **secret formulas** are not passed down by **True Persons** themselves,
and the **Primordial Sovereign’s** scriptures are not taught by the **Primordial Sovereign**,
how different is it from **Bai Zi** attending upon **Confucius** to study with him,
or **Yu’s** governance awaiting **Gao Yao** to assist in harmony?
Wasting time and energy in such ways will never yield results.

Thus, the **Nine Cauldrons’ Dao** and the **methods of longevity**—
if pursued in this manner, it is no different from courting death.

Life is precious to cherish, death is dreadful to fear.
Each lost day is like a swift river’s passage—
morning dew vanishes by evening light,
and sighs of regret come too late.

Now, if one merely encounters those who know the methods,
points out their intent, and relentlessly seeks them out,
then verifies themself while forming bonds with trustworthy companions,
and remains steadfast in their covenant—
this alone is sufficient for self-realization.
There will be no need for **True Persons** or **Divine Women** to lend their aid.

After the elixir is complete, one’s intestines cleansed and the medicine taken,
**Jade Maidens** may attend, or **Azure Dragons** come to escort.
Before its completion, no such signs are heard.

Thus the **Primordial Sovereign** said:
*"Beware of revealing the divine elixir to others,
lest they mock the **Dao** and slander the **True**."*

If the **elixir scriptures** are passed to the unworthy,
misfortune will surely follow.
Only those of sincere faith may be granted a share of the elixir’s composition—
never should the scripture itself be given away.
This is the way of the **True Persons**,
who guard their secrets as fiercely as they pass down oral **formulas**.

If one claims to have seen a **True Person**,
or that a **master of the methods** attained the **Dao** without their aid—
as with **Shang’s** encounter with **Peng Zu**,
or **Zhou’s** meeting with **Lao Zi**,
**Qin Shi Huang’s** vision of **An Qi**,
or **Han Wu’s** reliance on **Shao Jun**—
none of these truly attained the **Dao**.

Those who study the **Dao** most abhor idle chatter,
desiring neither to be seen by the vulgar nor to mingle in worldly affairs.
They walk hidden paths, sit in secluded places,
and scorn defamation, savoring solitude in their pursuit of the **Dao**.
Since tastes differ, slander is inevitable—
they regret not fleeing distant roads to avoid suspicion,
or keeping a thousand miles between themselves and doubt.

Yet what do **True Persons** seek to attain?
They tread through flames unburned, walk upon dark waters unshaken,
soaring with wings in the void, riding clouds in wind-driven chariots,
ascending to the **Purple Palace**, descending to **Kunlun’s** peaks.
If questioned by a passerby, they conceal their true nature,
moving in step with others, appearing as ordinary mortals—
how could one discern them? How could one ever recognize them?

Only those like **Zi Jin**, who rode his white crane,
or the **Yellow Emperor**, who was startled by the red dragon,
or those with scaled bodies like serpents,
or those clad in golden carriages with feathered robes—
unless one’s vision is piercing, one cannot witness their deeds;
unless one’s hearing is profound, one cannot grasp their words.
Since the vulgar cannot see or hear, they multiply their slanders—
thus the **True Persons** grow ever more reclusive.

What common folk cherish, the **Noble Ones** hold in contempt.
What common folk despise, the **Perfect Ones** value most.
Even great scholars and accomplished men
do not wish to mingle in the dust of the world.
How much more so the **Divine Women** and **True Persons**,
who rush not into human affairs!

The vulgar will find fault—
how else could they err so greatly?

Though mortal eyes may perceive a hundred paces,
they cannot see clearly—
yet they claim what they see exists and what they do not see does not.
But how many unseen things truly exist in the world?

It is like using a ladle to measure the sea and declaring the waters exhausted—
how deluded they are!

If **True Persons** are unseen, it does not mean they do not exist.
Nor can one seek what cannot be sought by mere presence.

Those who grasp the **Law** need not await the **True Persons**.
One who knows the **Law** knows the oral **formulas** and receives them.

I, your humble subject, have opened **Master Qiu’s** transmission of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,
and those who study the **scriptures** know that praise and blame lie in a single character.
**Master Kong’s** elucidation of the *Zhou Yi* shows that those who observe the **trigrams**
know that fortune and misfortune rest in a single symbol.
Even the **Confucian classics** cannot be fully understood without the **Law**—
how much more so the **Dao of Immortality** and the divine elixir,
which cannot be exhausted by mere scriptural study!

Thus the **Yellow Emperor** ascended **Kongtong** to seek the **Dao of Nature**,
and crossed **Wangwu** to obtain the **scriptures on elixir refinement**,
recording them in the *Plan of the Methods* and passing them down through oral **formulas**.
The **formulas** vanish with speech, the methods do not follow the scriptures.
Thus, though many seek, few attain—
though rare, the **Dao** is never entirely lost to humanity.

Once the **Law** is obtained by one, the body is no longer that of a common man.
The **Supreme Sage**, mindful of future generations who are easy to teach and trust,
causes them to reflect and attain it themselves,
freeing them from the calamities of death.

The vulgar do not believe, calling it empty words—
this is how the **True Persons** are slandered by those who defame the ancient sages.

Thus, to refine the divine elixir,
one must never let the unbelieving know of it—
for if they do, the medicine will fail.
This is a great taboo, not a minor restriction.

All such failures stem from not possessing the true **formulas**,
and thus the transformations cannot be completed.
Once the attempt is made and fails, slander arises.

It is like a farmer whose crops fail due to drought or flood,
yet he declares farming impossible.
But when the rains come and the grains grow,
he calls it a miracle—
just as the **scriptures** and **formulas**, if true, will yield the divine elixir.

The **formulas** have two forms:
One is the **written formula**, which can be transmitted in ink and paper.
The other is the **oral formula**, which cannot be spoken aloud.

Thus the *Yijing* says:
*"The written word does not exhaust speech,
and speech does not exhaust meaning."*

One’s conduct and practice of the **Dao** can be fully transmitted,
but the transformations of **yin-yang** cannot be articulated in words.

**Cinnabar** is naturally red, yet when refined, it becomes **mercury**.
**Mercury** is pure white, yet when refined again, it turns into elixir.
Those with shallow understanding cannot fathom this.

It is like burning **barite** to make it golden,
or turning **white lead** into fire-like brilliance—
those who claim no such **Dao** exists
are no better than the vulgar for their lack of pursuit.

The vulgar fear failure, dreading to be laughed at by common men.
They do not realize that if they succeed,
the wise will scorn them—
all because they did not obtain the true **scriptures** and **formulas**.

If transmitted to the wrong person, it brings blame and calamity.
Thus, the **Dao** is concealed and cannot be heard.

Therefore, **Ge Hong** said:
*"Within a single age, no more than two or three may attain it.*
*And again: Within the eight extremes of the world, how few will truly know it.*
*Secret formulas are difficult to hear, and those who obtain them are few.*
*They must first take an oath before transmission can occur.*
*Countless methods exist for the elixir of immortal life, yet without this formula, none can succeed.*

*The **Dao** is supremely secret—gold cannot buy its transmission.*
*If one transmits, they must first impart it orally from the original scripture,*
*never revealing it all at once.*
*The oath is sworn upon the **Alliance Scripture**, using eight *liang* of yellow gold,
forty *chi* of yellow cloth, eight *liang* of white silver,
and forty *chi* of white silk as tokens of faith,
with a limit of transmitting to only one person within a hundred years,
sealing the oath with blood.
*If later, one betrays or leaks this transmission to an unworthy disciple,*
*the Celestial Emperor will condemn them,*
*and they shall forever be barred from the Mysterious Path.*
*The Lord of the Great Mysterious will cause the oathbreaker’s heart to falter and mind to stray,*
*their studies ruined, their work undone.*
*The Grand Unity’s Registrar and the Three Heavens’ Commanders will record their transgressions,*
*and they shall be punished in the Great Mysterious Capital.*
*This is the **Dao** of the **Great Clarity’s** elixirs,
as revealed by **Zhang Daoling’s** secret formulas."*

**Hu Gangzi** said:
*"In my youth, I longed for the **Dao** of longevity.
For decades, I endured hunger, cold, and hardship,
traveling far and near, yet found no one who possessed it.
My resolve never wavered, and my dedication only deepened.
The **Great Ultimate** moved by my sincerity
and thus bestowed this formula upon me in the **Wuchang Valley**.
When I followed it faithfully, nothing failed.
From that moment, my **Dao** began.
I have kept it sealed in a jade case,
hidden in a sacred mountain.
If any common person obtains this formula,
whether wise or foolish, if they practice it with precision and devotion,
they shall surely attain the **Dao**."*

**Ge Hong** said:
*"Though I was born in the late age, I admired the ancient ways.
For over eighty years, I collected **Daoist** scriptures,
and though I heard of this formula, my eyes had never seen it.
I sought it relentlessly until my teacher, **Zheng Jun**,
finally transmitted it to me.
Upon receiving it, I purified my mind with fasting and meditation,
and after a hundred days of strict observance,
whatever I undertook succeeded.
I first transformed my breath into **Pure Qi**,
then consumed the **Five Spirit Springs** elixir,
and afterward mastered the **Method of Immortality**.
Only then did I dare to verify its truth—
now, my **Dao** skills are at my command.
If anyone else obtains this formula,
they must keep it in their heart and never speak of it lightly,
lest they reveal it to those unworthy of trust.
To do so would invite disaster—
the gods will not protect them,
and their work will fail.
I now solemnly warn future generations:
*Do not transmit this **Dao** recklessly.*
*This is the core secret passed down through the ages,*
*valued for its essence, not for widespread knowledge.*
*The method of transmission is found in the **Powder Formula**,
which is the **Secret of the Mysterious Pearl**."*

**Hu Gangzi** said:
*"The **Five Divine Metals’ Powder** is not merely for longevity.
Applied to the body, it repels common ailments and wards off all calamities.
This method originates from the **Jade Emperor’s** hidden scriptures,
beyond the reach of the vulgar.
Only those born with the **Dao’s** lineage can ever see it.
I, following the ancient hidden formulas,
now reveal it to future sages.
If one obtains this formula,
they must receive it through proper transmission—
do not lightly impart it to the unworthy.
If they do not follow the correct method,
their work will fail,
and even after ten thousand *kalpas* of practice,
they shall never attain the **Dao**.
The **Powder Diagram** states:
*‘Transmission must not be taken lightly.’*

*The day of transmission must be chosen on a **King-relative day**,
with a fasting altar erected.
Teacher and disciple stand before it,
burning precious incense day and night,
praying to the **Celestial Sovereign** for permission,
declaring their devotion to the **Dao** of longevity.
They recite:
‘For countless *kalpas*, I have cherished the **Dao** of immortality.
Now, through the mercy of my teacher,
I am permitted to receive this formula.
I dare not accept it lightly—
I humbly petition the **Celestial Sovereign** and my teacher,
begging for the transmission of the **Divine Gold Elixir** and the oral formulas and diagrams.
I swear by blood and cast a golden ring into flowing water,
pledging to uphold this method faithfully.
If one does not follow this transmission,
teacher and disciple alike will fail in their work.
This is the formula within the **Powder Diagram**.’*

**Hu Qiu Master** transmitted to **Ge Xian Gong**:
*"Your fate is aligned with the **Dao**—your name is recorded among the immortals.
I now bestow upon you the **Ten-Thousand-Gold Formula** and the methods of **Dao** cultivation.
Follow them precisely.
If you transmit this further,
only those who dwell in secluded mountains,
untainted by worldly desires,
shall be entrusted with it—
swear by blood and cast a golden ring,
erecting an altar to seal this oath.
Never transmit it recklessly.
To betray it to the unworthy will sever your name from the **Dao’s** records,
thin your virtue, and bring ruin to your descendants.
Beware—do not transmit it lightly.
This is the **Ten-Thousand-Gold Formula**."*

**The Scholar’s Annotation**:
*"The **Five Metals**, **Three Mercuries**, **Nine Leads**, and **Eight Stones** are all toxic.
Without the ancient formulas,
even if one claims newfound knowledge and transmits a few dozen phrases,
the result will be meaningless.
Thus, **Hu Gangzi** warned:
*The **Five Metals** are all fire-toxic.
If their poison is not refined into powder,
even if they transform into divine elixirs,
the lingering toxicity will, in time,
kill those who consume them if they violate even minor prohibitions.*

*Therefore, the complete formulas—including diagrams, methods of subjugating poisons,
and the powder-making process—are recorded here
to guide future practitioners.*

*The **Huzi Ten-Thousand-Gold Formula**,
*The **Five Metals Powder Diagram Formula**,
*The **Hidden Pearl Secret**,
*The **Zhang Tian Shi’s Oral Formula**—
these four formulas are treasures of the ancients.
Even if one encounters a single scroll of them,
they will still fail to grasp their true beginning and end."*

The text is garbled and confused,
asking for the inclusion of all methods.
Even if common folk were to know them all,
they would still fail to understand their proper use—
thus, the **Huzi Ten-Thousand-Gold Formula** is solemnly passed down through countless ages.

**Receiving the Oral Formula and Ritual Method:**
First, lay out the ritual implements,
and arrange the seat properly.
Take a white silk cloth four *chi* five *cun* in size as a base,
a measure of clear wine—one *dou*—
and seven slices of dried deer meat, or of beef or mutton,
each slice three *cun* square.
Place seven wine cups on a tray or table before you,
and set the meat slices behind each cup.
Place a token of faith to the left of the wine cups.

Burn incense and kneel respectfully, saying:
*"With utmost reverence, I invite the Sovereign of the Jade Court of Supreme Clarity,
the Lord of the Supreme Dao,
the Lord of the Great Constellation Emperor,*
*the Nine Elders of the Supreme Mysterious Celestial Capital,*
*and the Divine Lord of the Supreme Unity, who records and governs fate.*

*Descend to bestow upon this humble person of [certain] prefecture and [certain] district,*
*[certain] surname and given name,*
*and allow me to partake of your teachings.*

*[Alternative reading:] Partake of the incense offering.*
*Though I am but a mortal of low understanding,*
*I have long harbored the Dao’s verdant essence.*
*Now, by the grace of my master,*
*I have received the Great Formula,*
*—which I have kept secret in my heart,*
*without ever revealing it.*

*Though I know the heavenly prohibitions are most grave,*
*I cannot allow the Dao’s sacred path to remain forever concealed.*
*Now, here is [certain] surname and given name,*
*though dwelling among the vulgar,*
*whose heart reveres the Dao’s gate.*
*He does not prize gold and jade,*
*nor does he seek worldly glory and splendor.*
*He aspires only to the Mysterious Way,*
*and yearns to ascend the Purple Clouds."*

「故臧削自身，以備信物。
Thus, I have disciplined my body and purified my essence to prepare for the sacred substances.

诣臣某請受大訣，某不敢自專，輒敢啟白，唯願照知。
I, [certain] surname and given name, humbly seek to receive the Great Formula, yet I dare not keep it to myself—so I boldly present it, hoping only that you may recognize its truth.

石照明為之訖，乃再拜，上香酒三。
When the [ritual] of Stone Illumination is complete, I bow again and offer three libations of wine and incense.

上香酒訖，乃曰：勞屈玄尊，來臨下土，枉蒙降顧，心喜意悅，當聽某所陳，慈恩相欲，君以醉饱。
After offering the wine and incense, I say: *"I am honored by your labor, O Revered Daoist Master, to descend and visit this mortal realm. Though I am unworthy of your grace, my heart rejoices and my spirit is delighted. I shall now present my humble words—may your compassionate kindness accept them, and may you be sated by my devotion."*

持其酒食，請收餘福，見物永書。
I hold forth the wine and food, praying that you may gather the remaining blessings and forever inscribe this offering in your sacred records.

訖，乃再還，取酒脯，共所受人飲食之，勿與他人食。
When done, I return once more, take the wine and preserved meat, and share them with those who have received [the teachings], ensuring no others partake.

黄帝九鼎神丹經訣卷之三竟
*[End of] The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Formula, Volume Three.*

黄帝九鼎神丹經訣卷之四
*[Beginning of] The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Formula, Volume Four.*
*On Warding Off Malevolent Spirits, Guarding the Spirit, and Preserving the Body.*

臣按：凡學長生，須事神丹。
I, your humble servant, observe: *"To study longevity and transcendence, one must attend to the Divine Elixir.*

若不得金丹大藥，而但能饵草木之藥者，可以赊死，不得仙也。
If one cannot obtain the Golden Elixir, the Great Medicine, but merely ingests herbal remedies, one may only delay death—not attain transcendence.*

或但服藥，而不得房中之要，則終無久生之理矣。
Or if one takes only the medicine but does not grasp the essentials of the Chamber of Vitality [房中術], then one can never achieve lasting life.

或曉帶神符行禁，加思神守真一，則止可內疾不起，風濕不犯。
Some may know how to wear talismans, recite prohibitions, and meditate on the One True Qi, yet they can only prevent internal ailments from worsening and ward off wind-dampness [風濕].

若卒有惡鬼強邪，山精水毒害之，則便死也。
But if malevolent spirits, fierce demons, or mountain and water poisons assail them, they shall perish.

或不得入山，令山神為之作禍，則妖魅試人，猛獸傷之，蛇蝗螫之矣。
Or if one cannot enter the mountains, the mountain gods may bring misfortune—then demons will tempt them, fierce beasts will harm them, and serpents or locusts will sting them.

臣按：房中陰陽之道，高可以愈小疾，次可以免虛損。
I, your humble servant, further observe: *"The Way of Yin-Yang in the Chamber of Vitality is profound—at its highest, it can cure minor ailments; at its lesser, it can prevent depletion of vital essence.*

必不能移災解罪，去禍召福，安身全神，長生久視者也。
Yet it cannot truly avert disaster, absolve sins, banish calamity, summon blessings, ensure bodily safety, or preserve the spirit for eternal life and prolonged vision.

人問謂黃帝以千二百女升仙，便以黃帝單以此事長生也。
Some ask why the Yellow Emperor ascended with twelve hundred women, and thus assume that his transcendence depended solely on this act.

而不知黃帝於荊山之下，鼎湖之上，飛九鼎神丹成，乃乘龍登天也。
Yet they do not know that beneath the Jing Mountains and above the Cauldron Lakes, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir and ascended to the heavens upon a dragon.

黃帝自可有千二百女耳，而非得仙之所由也。
The Yellow Emperor could indeed have twelve hundred women, but this was not the means by which he attained transcendence.

凡養性之保命者，雖服千味之藥，三牲之膳，而不知房中之要者，亦無所益。
Those who seek to nourish their nature and preserve their lives, even if they consume a thousand flavors of medicines and the three sacrificial meats [三牲], yet do not understand the essentials of the Chamber of Vitality, gain no true benefit.

若縱情肆欲，不知能節宣，則伐命本也。
If one indulges in unrestrained desires, failing to know moderation and release, they harm the very root of their life force.

是玄素喻之水火，水火殺人，又能生人，在於用也。
This is like the interplay of water and fire in the Mysterious and Subtle Way—water and fire can both kill and sustain life, depending on how they are employed.

明自古合作神丹，必依名山。
From ancient times, the refining of the Divine Elixir has always depended on sacred mountains.

臣按：昔者黃帝受丹經於王屋，訪至道於崆峒，然后於刑山之下，鼎湖之上，飛化九轉。
I, your humble servant, note: *"In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor received the Elixir Formula from the Rong House [王屋], sought the Supreme Way at the Kunlun Peaks [崆峒], and then beneath the Xing Mountains and above the Cauldron Lakes, he ascended through nine transformations.*

道成仙去。
Thus, his Way was perfected, and he departed as a transcendent.

又昔之左元放，於天柱山中，精思而感神人，授之以金丹仙經。
And in the past, Left Primordial [左元放] in the Tianzhu Mountains concentrated his thoughts and was visited by a divine person, who taught him the Golden Elixir Transcendent Formula.

會漢末大亂，不遑合作，而避地江束，志造名山，以修此道。
When the chaos of the late Han Dynasty arose, he could not attend to refining the elixir, so he fled to the Jiang Bundle region [江束] and resolved to construct a sacred mountain to cultivate this Way.

乃以《九鼎神丹經》等，授弟子葛仙公。
Thus, he passed on the *Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Formula* and other teachings to his disciple, Ge Xian Gong [葛仙公].

又以其法，授弟子鄭君。
And he also taught his methods to his disciple, Zheng Jun [鄭君].

鄭君家貧，無以買藥。
Zheng Jun was poor and lacked the means to purchase medicines.

而葛洪者，鄭君之弟子，親事勤苦矣。
Yet Ge Hong, Zheng Jun’s disciple, was diligent and labored earnestly in his service.

鄭君乃於馬迩山中立壇，盟授洪丹經，並具諸口訣，訣不書也。
Zheng Jun then established an altar in the Maqi Mountains and solemnly transmitted the Elixir Formula to Hong, along with all the oral incantations—though these incantations were not recorded in writing.

洪得此道二十餘年，資無擔石，無以為之始。
Hong possessed this Way for over twenty years, yet his resources were meager—he could not even begin to refine the elixir.

鄭君謂洪日：吾承先師左君之誡曰：諸小山中，不可居作金及神丹也。
Zheng Jun told Hong: *"I have inherited my master Left Primordial’s warning, which states: ‘In minor mountains, one must not dwell to forge gold or refine the Divine Elixir.’*

且小山之中，無有正神，皆是木之精，千歲老物，血食之鬼，此輩皆是邪氣，不念為人修道作福，但欲於祸人也。
Moreover, within minor mountains, there are no true deities—only the spirits of wood, ancient trees, and blood-feeding ghosts. These beings are filled with malevolent qi and do not consider aiding mortals in cultivating the Way or bringing blessings; they only wish to harm them.

夫齋潔之士，雖以術數辟身，而鬼魅或能壞人藥也。
Even the most ascetic and pure among us, though they may use talismans and prohibitions to ward off spirits, may still have their medicines spoiled by malevolent ghosts and demons.

今合醫家佳藥好膏，皆尚不欲令鵷犬，及婦人小兒等見之。
Now, when combining the finest medicines and ointments from the physicians’ arts, one must not allow even dogs and parrots—or women and children—to see them.

如藥被見者，用便不驗。
If the medicines are seen by such beings, their efficacy will be lost.

又染彩物者，遇惡目見之，皆失其色也。
Furthermore, if colored substances are exposed to evil gazes, they will lose their potency.

配神仙長生之大藥乎。
How much more so when refining the Great Medicine for transcendence and longevity!

以古之道士，合作神藥，必入名山無人之地，終不止於小小凡山中，正为此也。」

Moreover, according to the Daoist scriptures, the mountains where one may refine transcendental medicines through profound contemplation include **Huàshān (華山)**, **Tàishān (泰山)**, **Huòshān (霍山)**, **Héngshān (恒山)**, **Sōnggāoshān (嵩高山)**, **Shàoshì (少室)**, **Tàibái (太白)**, and **Zōngnán (終南)**.

Within these mountains reside **orthodox deities (正神)**, where **Earthly Immortals (地仙)** dwell, and **lingzhi (芝草)** grows—capable of warding off great calamities and floods, not merely suitable for refining medicines. If a practitioner of the Dao ascends them, the mountain deities will surely bestow blessings upon them, ensuring the medicines are perfected.

The scholar reflects: The true nature of Heaven and Earth, the auspicious and inauspicious interplay of **Yin and Yang (阴阳)**, is indeed difficult to discern, yet it cannot be said that such forces do not exist. Thus, the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Historian all placed their trust in them.

Additionally, the **classics and traditions (经传)** speak of **political cycles (政历)** and the **auspicious timing of firmness and softness (明时刚柔之日)**, where only favorable days yield success, a principle long established.

Therefore, sovereigns appoint the **Grand Historian (太史官)**, bestow titles and honors upon him, and when conducting rites at ancestral temples or **sacrificial offerings to Heaven and Earth (郊祀)**, they carefully select the most propitious days. Yet, those who claim to be virtuous or ordinary, who boast of transcending the mundane, would shamefully neglect such auspicious days in their movements and dwellings—are they not blinded by their own views?

In general, ascending mountains without selecting the proper day and hour may still yield results, but such attempts should not be taken lightly.

Great and small mountains alike possess **divine spirits (神灵)**—the greater the mountain, the greater its deity; the smaller the mountain, the lesser its deity. Without proper precautions, harm will surely follow.

Some may suffer **illness (疾病)**, others **frightful shocks (惊怖)**, some **injuries from thorns or blades (伤刺)**, some **strange sounds (异声)**, some **encounter anomalies (变异)**, some **see spectral apparitions (光景)**, or witness **great trees collapse without wind (不风而摧折)** or **cliffs crumble without cause (无辜而自堕)**. Others may be driven to **madness and confusion (迷乱)**, causing them to **stumble and fall into ravines (狂走坠落坑谷)**, or **fierce beasts and venomous serpents (猛兽毒蛇)** may attack them. Hence, one must not ascend lightly.

When entering mountains, one must first choose days aligned with the **Four Seasons' Celestial Masters (四时王相)** and their **Stems and Branches (支干)** in harmonious generation. Such days are favorable.

Moreover, if one follows the **auspicious timing of the Evasion Hexagram (遁甲)**, the result is even better.

One must also select the **auspicious days within the lunar month (月中吉日)**.

If there is urgency and one cannot wait for a fully auspicious day, one should at least avoid the **taboo days of the month (束岳岁月忌)**. For instance:
- **Huàshān (華山)** forbids entry during **Years of Jia and Yi (甲乙)** or **Years of Yín and Mǎo (寅卯)**, specifically in **Months 1 and 2 (正月、二月)**.
- **Nányuè (南岳)** forbids entry during **Years of Bǐng and Dīng (丙丁)** or **Years of Jǐ and Wǔ (己午)**, specifically in **Months 4 and 5 (四月、五月)**.
- **Zhōngyuè (中岳)** forbids entry during **Years of Wù and Sì (戊巳)**, **Years of Chén and Xū (辰戌)**, or **Years of Chǒu and Wèi (丑未)**, in **all four seasons (四季之月)**.
- **Xīyuè (西岳)** forbids entry during **Years of Gēng and Xīn (庚辛)** or **Years of Shēn and Yǒu (申酉)**, specifically in **Months 7 and 8 (七月、八月)**.
- **Běiyuè (北岳)** forbids entry during **Years of Rén and Guǐ (壬癸)** or **Years of Hài and Zǐ (亥子)**, specifically in **Months 10 and 11 (十月、十一月)**.

The above restrictions do not apply only to the **Five Sacred Peaks (五岳)**. Rather, for any mountain one ascends, one must observe the taboos of its corresponding **Sacred Peak category (方面)**.

The **"Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure (《灵宝经》)"** states:
*"When ascending mountains, one must choose **Preserving Days (保日)**, **Righteous Days (义日)**, or **Exclusive Days (专日)**—these are of great auspiciousness. If one ascends on **Restraining Days (制日)** or **Slaying Days (伐日)**, death will surely follow."*

**Preserving Days (保日)** refer to days where the **Stems and Branches (支干)** generate harmoniously above and below—such as **Jia-Wǔ (甲午)** or **Yi-Sì (乙巳)**. **Jia (甲)** is Wood, **Wǔ (午)** is Fire; **Yi (乙)** is Wood, **Sì (巳)** is Fire. Since Fire is born from Wood, these combinations align with the **Evasion Hexagram’s principles (遣法)**, integrating both **talismans (符)** and **Daoist prohibitions (数道)**, making them most efficacious.

Thus, the **talismanic methods (符法)** are detailed in the later volumes. **End of Volume Four of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Scripture of Divine Elixir (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之四竟)**.

**Volume Five of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Scripture of Divine Elixir (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之五)**.

The **Crimson Elixir’s** attainment of the **Divine Dan** must rely on the **Dao’s** profound resources.

I have heard that to seek **long life and eternal vision**, to harmonize with Heaven and Earth—if one has not grasped the **ultimate essentials**, then the lesser arts must still be known. For they collectively fulfill the **Dao** of **nourishing life**.

In grand terms, it is like a sovereign governing a state: both **literary and martial** arts must be employed without omission. In minor terms, it is like crafting a chariot: no single component—**axle, hub, or rim**—can be neglected.

What is called the **Dao** encompasses **internal cultivation of form and spirit**, prolonging life and healing ailments, and **external warding of malevolence**, preventing calamities from encroaching. It is like a **zither or se**, where a single string cannot produce harmony, or like **armor and weapons**, where a single reinforcement cannot withstand the blade.

Those who **nourish life** must seek **broad knowledge** while valuing the **essential**, observe **diverse methods** while choosing the **virtuous**. A single practice, no matter how refined, cannot suffice alone.

Moreover, there are those who pursue **esoteric arts** but cling to their own strengths. Those who speak of **playing with the Three Pure Ones** claim only the **Chamber of Mystery** can prolong life. Those who elucidate **breathing techniques** assert only **qi cultivation** can extend years. Those who know the **laws of contraction and extension** say only **guiding and pulling** can defy aging. Those who master **herbal prescriptions** declare their remedies can cure all.

Those who fail in the **Dao** do so by relying on **partial methods alone**. Once the **Great Elixir** is perfected, all else becomes unnecessary. Before its completion, nothing can be spared.

It is like a farmer tending to his fields: if he possesses **gold, silver, jewels, and pearls** in his embrace, sufficient to sustain generations, he rests assured. But if he lacks such wealth, how can he not sow **a hundred grains** and store **abundant vegetables**?

Thus, **fasting to abstain from grains**, **warding off weapons**, **suppressing ghosts and demons**, **summoning and controlling poisons**, **healing diseases and curing illnesses**—when entering mountains, ensuring **ferocious beasts do not attack**; when crossing waters, preventing **dragon serpents from harming**; **snakes from biting**, **epidemics from striking**—these are minor matters, yet those who **nourish life** must not overlook them.

The **Divine Elixir** is the **greatest matter of longevity**; how can it be delayed?

In antiquity, the **Yellow Emperor** crossed **Ronghu Mountain** to receive the **Scripture of the Elixir**, ascended **Kongtong Peak** to question **Broad Successor**, and sought the **Dao of nourishing life**, hearing the **doctrines of the Three Pure Ones**. When exploring **mysteries and marvels**, he recorded them in the **words of Bai Ze**. Thus, exhausting the **truths of the Dao**, encompassing all **secret principles**, he **refined the Nine Transformations** beneath **Jing Mountain**, and **flowed like pearls** above **Ding Lake**. Through the **power of the Divine Elixir** and the **achievement of eternal vision**, he ultimately **ascended the Dragon’s Peak**, transcending with Heaven and Earth without limit.

After the **Dao** was perfected, there was **nothing left to do**. Before its attainment, there was **nothing it did not require**. From antiquity to now, none have succeeded without **vast knowledge, broad understanding, and unremitting effort**.

**Illuminating the Daoist Three Sovereigns’ Text and the Five Peaks’ True Forms Diagram**

I have heard that when entering mountains to refine the **Elixir**, seeking the **Dao** in **purity and stillness**, the **Three Sovereigns’ Text** and the **Five Peaks’ True Forms Diagram**—when summoning **mountain spirits**, consulting the **Ghost Ledger**, and questioning the **local deities, mountain officials, and marsh marshals**—one comes to know the **monsters of wood and stone**, the **essences of mountains and rivers**, which dare not approach to test mortals.

It is like the **Buddhist *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra***, where sacred sites are marked: knowing this, one recognizes the **stūpa**, and all malevolent beings naturally retreat. The **Daoists** who possess this **Text** govern its efficacy, hence it is said that the **most sacred of Daoist scriptures** is not lightly bestowed. Those who receive it transmit it only once every **forty years**. The transmitter swears an oath with **blood**, pledging his very life.

The **Five Sacred Peaks** all possess this **Text**, hidden in **secluded stone chambers**. Those destined to attain the **Dao**, with **sincere devotion**, will have the **mountain spirits** reveal it. If one obtains this **Text**, it must be placed in its proper location. Whatever is undertaken, one must first **know it as reverently as serving one’s parents and sovereign**.

The **Scripture** states:
*"If a household possesses the **Three Sovereigns’ Text**, it repels all **malevolent spirits, poisons, epidemics, and calamities**. If one is afflicted with illness, near death, and yet believes in the **Dao**, and with sincere heart invokes this **Text**, they shall be revived."*

The **Daoist** who seeks **transcendence**, invoking this **Text** into the mountains, repels **tigers and mountain spirits**; the **Five Poisons and a hundred malevolences** dare not approach. One may **cross rivers and seas**, repelling **dragon serpents and winds**. Its methods can **transform and manifest efficacy**, regardless of **auspicious or inauspicious omens, calamities, or retributions**.

Those who seek verification must **observe strict purity for a hundred days**, then according to the method, summon the **gods of destiny, the Year God, the Day God, the Five Peaks, the Four Seas, and the deities of the soil and grain**. They will appear in human form, allowing one to inquire into **fortune and misfortune, safety and peril**, and the **origins of a sick person’s afflictions**.

Among **Daoists**, if one obtains this **Text** but lacks **benevolence, righteousness, and compassion**, or is not **pure and upright**, even if they possess it, **calamity will swiftly befall them**. It must not be treated lightly.

Thus, in antiquity, the **Yellow Emperor** bound himself to **Qingqiu Hill**, passed through **Feng Mountain**, and met **Master Purple Symbol**, receiving the **Inner Text of the Three Sovereigns**, using it to **forcefully summon ten thousand spirits**—this is the very **Text** in question.

**Illuminating the Verification of Talismans in Invoking Spirits**

I have examined: when entering mountains to refine the **Elixir**, the most **critical method** to repel **mountain and river deities, temple spirits, and ghosts** is through **talismans**. The **Great Elixir** and **divine medicines** also rely on the **power of talismans** for protection.

The **talismanic methods** are all **celestial texts** from **Laozi**; **Laozi** received them from **divine humans**. When people use them and find them slightly effective, it is because the **transcriptions lack proper transmission**, leading to many errors. Additionally, their **faith is not sincere**, and they merely apply them without devotion.

Moreover, even **common scriptures** contain identical characters, where **Spring and Autumn Annals** scholars like **Du Yu** corrected errors in **five instances**, and **Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian*** was emended by **Zi Xia** for **Yǐ-Hài** mistakes.

This is the **talismanic method** as well.

The saying goes: *"Three transcriptions of a book, and the fish becomes Lu; the emperor becomes a tiger seven."* Scholars merely follow the sound of the characters, and when faced with questions of length or stroke count, they often introduce errors. As for **talismans**, their strokes and patterns are not like ordinary characters—mistakes cannot be detected, errors cannot be perceived, so no one knows whether they are correct or incorrect.

Yet, those who seek **long life** must first control the **medicine**, not rely on the **power of talismans** alone to achieve transcendence. Still, what must not be neglected is their ability to **ward off ghosts and repel malevolence**, assisting the gradual refinement of the **Great Elixir**.

For the **talisman of the Named Mountain**, summoning the **High Mountain Lord’s talisman**:
This **talisman** requires a ten-day fast. When summoning the **High Mountain Lord**, it removes the harm of tigers and wolves. The **talisman** is written in cinnabar on silk, measuring one *chi* two *cun* in both length and width. If written without proper breath and intent, it will be ineffective. Upon completion, burn incense, then at night in a quiet chamber, align it with the moon’s position, wear new clothing, and invoke it—its characters facing downward.

For using **talismans**, write large characters on the front of both shoulders, always maintaining a steady and reverent focus on their auspicious symbols. Place additional **talismans** at the **Six Jia Positions** (六甲), aligned with the **talisman**, along with the names of the **Immortal Maiden** (玉女), invoking the entity summoned. Gaze upward, visualize its form, and imagine beyond the eight directions, extending one’s **spirit** (神) to five *chi* in length. Clothing should follow the **Six Jia Scripture** (《六甲经》).

For the **Mountain Ascent Talisman**, the **Immortal** Chen Anshi, upon entering the mountain, wrote it on the **Jia-Yin day** (甲寅) on white silk. At night, facing the **Big Dipper** (北斗), he offered wine and dried meat, recited his name, and placed it inside his collar to **ward off malevolence** and **subdue a hundred ghosts**, repelling **noxious beasts** (老物), tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. He wore it, set it upon his desk, and faced the **Big Dipper**.

This **talisman** has the same strokes as the previous one, differing only slightly in size and form, yet its efficacy remains identical. Thus, both are preserved here.

This **talisman** may be written in cinnabar on silk or plain white silk, worn on the left arm for men and the right for women, or placed at the dwelling’s four directions and four corners, as well as along the path one travels—four sets at each fifty *bu* interval—to **ward off all spirits**.

This **talisman** is also for repelling tigers and wolves. When moving or relocating the plaque, if one wishes to **ward off mountain spirits**, it should be used along the path.

I note: Those who practice the **Dao** often dwell in mountains and forests, which are dens of **noxious beasts** (老物), **poisonous snakes**, and **spirits and demons** (精怪魍魉). Without profound precautions and **warding methods**, one risks harming the **medicine**. In ancient times, the **Round Mound** (圆丘) was filled with great snakes, yet it also produced fine medicines. When the **Yellow Emperor** ascended the mountain to seek these **medicines**, the snakes became venomous. **Master Guangcheng** taught the **Yellow Emperor** to wear **雄黄** (male yellow, realgar), and all the snakes retreated. Thus, those who enter mountains to refine the **Great Elixir**, unaware of mountain entry **warding methods**, often face grave dangers. The saying goes: *"Beneath Mount Taihua, bones lie strewn like wolves’ tracks"*—this is because they know only one thing and cannot be fully prepared. Though they seek **life**, they hasten toward **death**.

Yet **Daoists** only grasp the **Great Principle** (大方) and neglect the **mountain entry warding methods**, which is no small matter. Though snakes vary in kind, the **locust snake** (蝗蛇) and the **green scaly snake** (青蛞) that bite humans are the most urgent. If not treated within a day, they kill. To save a victim, cut away the wounded flesh with a knife, cast it upon the ground—it resembles burning coals—and in moments, it withers completely, allowing the person to recover. However, these two snakes peak in venom during autumn, when they cannot prey on living things. They then bite their **large bamboo or wood**, causing them to wither and die—this is their way of **venting poison**. Thus, when ascending a mountain, fearing these snakes is paramount. One must first **prevent harm at home**, mastering the **warding methods** beforehand.

Focus on the **cycles of day and month**, as well as the **Vermilion Bird** (朱乌), **Black Tortoise** (玄武), **Green Dragon** (青龙), and **White Tiger** (白虎) to **guard one’s body**. Then, in the mountain’s grasslands, take the **Three Qis** (三气) on the left and seal them.

Walk through the mountain grass in sequence, and focus your mind to gather **Lún-qi** of a crimson hue, filling the air like clouds and mist for tens of miles around.

If traveling with companions—whether three or five—arrange them in a circle. Have each blow forth their **qi**, and even if they tread upon snakes, the serpents shall not move. Moreover, they shall not even be seen.

Additionally, carry five *liang* of **realgar**. Once you ascend the mountain, you need not fear the snakes. If bitten, apply realgar powder to the wound, and it shall heal.

Also, bind **dried realgar** and **aconite** behind your elbows, or burn the horns of oxen, sheep, or deer to focus the essence, or stuff the waxy secretion from **wild bees’ ears** into your ears, or place a **musk pellet** beneath your toenails—all are effective.

The **Hundred-Snakes-Warding Seal** and the **Talisman That Repels Tigers and Wolves**
These two divine seals are inscribed on **date pits** with a **bi** brush, arranged in a square formation, and offered with two prostrations before being worn. They are highly effective.

These are the seals taught by the **Yellow-Headed Maiden of the Vermilion Palace** and the **Jade Room**, which cause tigers and wolves to retreat without daring to approach.

This may also be written as a talisman in **vermilion script**, swallowed before entering the mountains to repel tigers and wolves. It may also be made into a seal.

From the *Jade Embryo Scripture*.

This talisman repels ghosts. When mixing medicines, hang it on all four sides to subdue them—its divine efficacy is great.

One version has seven curves at its center; the rest remains the same. If this is unknown, it is likely an error.

This is a **mountain-dwelling talisman**, inscribed on a **spirit board** and placed at the four doorposts. Tigers and wolves shall not come near.

All three talismans above are written in **vermilion script**.

One version of this talisman reads as follows:
This is the **Mountain-Opening Talisman**, made from **thousand-year-old hemp** (*Máimén Dòng*), twelve *cùn* long. Write this talisman in cinnabar and press it onto a great stone at a named mountain. The mountain gate shall open, and the **Treasure Scripture** shall emerge.

Gold and jade shall also appear before you.

*Thousand-year-old hemp* is **Heaven’s Mercy**—resembling a mouse’s ear—repelling ghosts and subduing spirits.

In deep, quiet mountains, construct a **cinnabar hall** at the four corners, hang **bell charms**, and prepare **ghost-repelling medicines** and **ghost-repelling talismans** on all sides before mixing medicines. Otherwise, ghosts and spirits will absorb the medicine’s essence, causing it to fail entirely. Thus, talismans and exorcisms must be prepared beforehand.

**Method for Ghost-Repelling Medicine**:
Take **illuminating sand**, realgar, orpiment, musk, aconite, white wood, **ghostvine**, and **devil’s archer**—each two *dōu*—and knead with honey.

From the *Yellow Emperor’s Jade Platform Diagram and Talisman*.

The minister notes: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor visited **Éméi Mountain**, where he saw the **Celestial Sage** in the **Jade Hall**. He requested the **True Dao** and sought **immortality**.

The Celestial Sage, formerly the Yellow Emperor’s master, spoke thus:

*"All Daoists who seek immortality and wish to forge great medicines, refining the five stones, must dwell in secluded mountain retreats, never lingering in defiled or worldly places. If they violate this, the medicines they concoct will never succeed. Moreover, if they lack My **Jade Platform Secret Talisman**, even with other methods, nothing will come to fruition."*

The Celestial Sage further declared:

*"All Daoists who seek immortality and obtain this text shall soon attain the Dao. Those who wish to enter the mountains to study the Dao, forge the elixir, kindle the fire, and craft the medicine of longevity must first observe a fast for one hundred and fifty days. Then, on auspicious days—**Wangxiang Days** and **Five-Peace Days**—when the hour does not clash, they must use fragrant bathwater, **well-blossom water**, twelve *shēng* of white grain flour, one *liǎng* of cinnabar, one *dōu* of white honey, and one *dōu* of mulberry twig ash.

First, take one *dōu* of the five-scented bathwater, then mix the flour, cinnabar, honey, and ash together with a **tao-twig stirrer**—three inches long—stirring it twenty-one times in the **Yang-direction**. Place the mixture in a quiet chamber.

Take the **Platform Talisman**, and with a clear, tranquil mind, use a fresh brush to inscribe it according to the prescribed method, placing it at the edge of the bath basin, facing the corresponding direction.

Take a copper vessel and suspend the **Central Talisman** above the bath, three *chǐ* from the water. After adjusting one’s breath and stepping outside, perform the **Yǔ-bù steps**, hold one’s breath, then re-enter the chamber. Slowly release the breath near the bath basin, regulate one’s breathing to settle, close the eyes, press the palms together, stand upright and composed. First, bow seven times in homage to the **East Direction Talisman**, then fourteen times to the **South Direction Talisman**, twenty-one times to the **West Direction Talisman**, thirty-five times to the **North Direction Talisman**, and finally, facing the door with feet aligned, bow forty-nine times to the talisman above the bath basin. Then, bathe from head to toe in the bathwater, ensuring inner and outer purity with its fragrance.

Once the bathwater is exhausted, don fresh garments. Bind the **Square Talisman** to the left arm, place the **West Direction Talisman** on the right arm, the **South Direction Talisman** before the heart, the **North Direction Talisman** on the back, and swallow the **Central Talisman**.

Afterward, observe strict purity for seven more days in a secluded chamber. The **Five Cloud Divine Might** will descend, its light illuminating the room, radiating within and without. Do not be alarmed—remain steadfast in **Oneness**, for the Divine Presence will manifest. There may be pressure, and soon its form will vanish—this is the supreme verification.

Or, if questioned by others, the radiant light itself shall be the proof.

Should these signs appear, the Dao will inevitably be attained. From that point onward, all endeavors will succeed.

For those who seek longevity, transcend the world, transmute the five stones, ingest wondrous medicines, reverse aging, or ascend as immortals—if they do not adhere to the talismanic method, all their efforts will fail. They will waste their labor, achieving nothing. Slander will arise, claiming no Daoist methods exist. Though they employ various other techniques—whether through **prohibitive incantations**, **single talismans**, or medicines—they will still fail without this method. There is no doubt.

Moreover, if one forges medicines not to cultivate the Dao or nurture the True Self, but for worldly gain and glory—pursuing **yellow and white alchemy**—there will be no success. This will invite the disdain of the numinous, provoke the wrath of spirits, invite calamities, and bring misfortune. Not only will the medicines be wasted, but poverty will follow. How can this be beneficial? It will only shorten one’s life and bring ruin. Be cautious and reflect deeply.

Let no Daoist recklessly transmit this to the unworthy, nor speak of it to others. Those without shared aspiration must not lightly divulge it."*

「This is the first *Huánglǎo Yútái* divine talisman, governing the **Southern Quarter**. Use **black** as the base, and **white flowers** as the design. The second *Huánglǎo Yútái* divine talisman governs the **Western Quarter**, with **white** as the base and **yellow flowers** as the design. There is a central talisman with the character *fù* (父) beneath its core; when making this talisman, the rest follow the same pattern.

The third *Huánglǎo Yútái* divine talisman governs the **Northern Quarter**, with **indigo** as the base and **blue flowers** as the design. The fourth *Huánglǎo Yútái* divine talisman governs the **Central Quarter**, with **yellow** as the base and **black flowers** as the design. #¹ The fifth *Huánglǎo Yútái* divine talisman governs the **Eastern Quarter**, with **blue** as the base and **crimson flowers** as the design.

The *Huángrén* (皇人) says: *"For any Daoist who wishes to employ these talismans, let them use the five colors as their seats, placing them according to the respective quarters. Each must be cleansed and purified. Only the Central Quarter’s divine elixir talisman is placed in a copper cauldron, with yellow as its seat, suspended above the cauldron three feet from the water—some say seven feet."*

*"The method for each seat is to make them square and equal in measure, then to wrap them in a pouch of equal size, binding them as described above. For the Central Quarter, burn the talisman along with its seat and consume the ashes mixed with water. The Huángrén says: ‘In the mountains, when refining elixirs or tending the furnace, one must first obtain my talisman. Only then will the Dao be fulfilled. When setting up the furnace and placing the *áo* (鳌) beneath it, choose a day when the *Ruler* (王) and *Minister* (相) *Stems* (支) and *Branches* (干) do not clash. From each of the four sides of the furnace, measure three feet outward, and bury it five inches deep. Then take the Central Quarter talisman and bury it beneath the furnace, seven feet deep. Afterward, at the furnace’s placement, swallow the Central Quarter talisman along with it. Then wear the talisman corresponding to one’s own person, and the numinous immortals will aid and protect you—keep it secret."*

*"All great named mountains possess divine *zhī* (芝), sacred grasses, and wondrous elixirs of the immortals. Without a secret method, acquiring them is difficult. Even if one finds them, they will vanish in an instant. Daoists seeking these elixirs should first observe strict fasting, bathe in fragrant waters, and wear these five-colored *Yútái* divine talismans. Whatever divine *zhī* (芝) or sacred grasses they encounter, they may take as they wish. All such plants are guarded by tigers, wolves, dragons, serpents, great *mǎng* (蟒), and myriad poisons, and the Daoist must wear the talismans when entering or leaving. Then all mountain spirits and numinous beings will retreat and conceal themselves, turning their gaze upon the Daoist, who will also be augmented in protection."*

*"The completion of the fifth scroll of the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon* (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之五). The beginning of the sixth scroll of the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon* (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之六).*

The *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon* (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀) elucidates the profound Dao of seeking the divine *shéndān* (神丹) for universal benefit.

The humble servant hears that among all forms created between Heaven and Earth, humanity is the most precious. Yet, bound by the swift decay of aging and death, proper cultivation sustains life, while neglect hastens its end. Life is a treasure to be cherished, death a fate to be dreaded. Thus, the Daoist tradition holds this Way of longevity as its most sacred and weighty pursuit—none surpasses this method of attaining eternal life.

If the elixirs and methods of longevity are sought, none exceeds the Dao of the divine *shéndān*. Should this Dao be perfected yet fail to grant longevity, then never in antiquity was there such a Way.

The value of life to oneself is indeed immense. When comparing worth, even the highest noble rank—public duke or great marquis—cannot measure its worth. When weighing its importance, even vast rewards and territorial grants cannot exchange it. A lifespan of one hundred years comprises over three thousand days; in youth and weakness, one knows little joy, while in old age, pleasures grow insipid. The span between vigor and decrepitude, excluding the occasional decades of moderate health, often amounts to mere thousands of days—flitting like lightning or swift as a galloping steed. Of those who reach a hundred years, only one in ten thousand does so without affliction. Yet even if one survives, sorrow, hardship, and turmoil soon follow. Therefore, the noble pursuit of the worthy must first secure the matter of longevity, so that they may act freely, without praying for transcendence, and enjoy pleasures with others, equaling the lifespan of *Péngzǔ* (彭祖) or the distant longevity of *Shǎojiūn* (少君). Thus, they may nurture their families, hold office, and neither fail in their duties to superiors and inferiors nor forfeit the joys of human nature. This is indeed a grand endeavor.

Yet the Way of longevity must rely upon elixirs, and among elixirs, the divine *shéndān* holds supreme mastery—an unparalleled method as proclaimed by the Yellow Emperor. Yet scholars misinterpret, and seekers err in their pursuit. They claim the Dao lies in mere textual prescriptions, that the divine *shéndān* is but a mundane elixir for vitality and transcendence. Following such doctrines blindly, they achieve nothing in a hundred attempts.

This failure is not due to the elixirs themselves lacking efficacy, but because the Dao is not recorded. Hence, *Liú Xiàng* (刘向) did not attain mastery in the Han dynasty, and *Táo Míng* (陶明) found no verification in the Liang era. Only those of keen intelligence and profound wisdom, whose talents suffice to undertake such labors, who endure arduous trials, accumulate through hardship, and persistently refine their inner cultivation and outer alchemy—commencing with resolve and completing with steadfastness, neither wavering nor straying—who do not await the evening’s dawn for morning’s work nor stand in expectation of seated results, who are not deterred by slander nor weary of prolonged effort, who endure initial hardship only to reap final ease—can they achieve this.

It is akin to a sovereign governing a state or a general confronting an enemy: external conquest relies on martial strategy, while internal governance depends on wise counsel. Thus, the human body mirrors a realm: the chest and abdomen are its palaces, the limbs its officials, the spirit its sovereign, the blood its ministers, and the *qi* its people. The cultivation of the body is like ruling a state; cherishing one’s people preserves the realm, while firming one’s *qi* safeguards the spirit. To preserve the spirit, one must not deplete the *qi*; to preserve the realm, one must not scatter the people. Human *qi* is difficult to nourish yet easily endangered, hard to purify yet easily turbid.

Thus, one must uphold the balance of virtue and authority to safeguard the state, and curb desires to fortify the blood and *qi*, only then may one achieve the ultimate purpose. When the Way of longevity is perfected, a hundred calamities are averted, and years of life are extended.

Compare this to wood such as willow and poplar—easily grown things. Even if planted shallowly or improperly, they flourish with little care: sometimes they thrive, sometimes they wither, sometimes they sway, sometimes they are uprooted. Though nourished with fertile soil and bathed in spring’s dew, they do not perish swiftly, for their roots rot slowly, and their sprouts struggle to emerge, their vital fluids unable to coalesce into sustaining *qi*. Yet the human body is fragile, easily injured and hard to cultivate. When set against these two, it falls far short.

The causes of its destruction are manifold, yet its afflictions surpass even the violent uprooting or swaying of willow and poplar. The vital *qi* is worn down by exhaustion, the *hóngwèi* (荣卫) system dissipates from overuse, the form is consumed by *jiānáo* (煎熬), and the natural balance is eroded by excessive strain. Improper diet, indulgence in luxury, exposure to wind and damp, or the onset of disease—when such misfortunes arise, some entrust their fate to herbal remedies, others to the aid of spirit-mediums. Yet this is like digging wells for water on high ground or plowing barren fields for sustenance when famished.

What can herbs truly restore? What power do gods and spirits possess to heal? If life could be prolonged by herbs and illness dispelled by rites, then physicians would all live forever, and shamans would never fall ill.

Thus the Canon states: *"It is not in the rites of sacrifice to Qi (杞) nor in invoking the gods and spirits with vows and incantations. The Way of longevity lies solely in the divine *shéndān*."* Knowing this is not easy; practicing it is even harder. Yet among those who seek the Dao, few advance while many retreat. Many claim to understand, but few achieve the ultimate purpose. It is not the Dao that is hard to hear, nor the practice that is difficult—it is the perseverance to its end that is arduous. Without utmost clarity, one cannot discern it; without tireless effort, one cannot master it. If it were easy to attain, then the Han Emperor *Wǔ* (武) would have secured it through his encounter with *Shǎojiūn* (少君). If it were easy to comprehend, then *Liú Xiàng* (刘向) would have unlocked it from the *Zhěnzhōng* (枕中) text.

Therefore, the Yellow Emperor ascended *Kēngdōng* (崆峒) to seek the Dao, and *Xià Yǔ* (夏禹) enshrined the golden tablets in a jade casket. Some attained their purpose and ascended, others perfected the Way and departed as immortals—evidence of their success is clear, and their methods flourished among earlier practitioners.

The true method of longevity is found only in the divine *shéndān*. Using *dān* (丹) as gold, gold as the vessel, and the vessel as its repository, one nourishes the body by ingestion, gradually dissolving the intestines and stomach, irrigating the *hóngwèi* (荣卫) system, and drawing upon its utmost strength and integrity to arrest the passage of time.

Yet gold, though called the supreme treasure, varies in quality. Some gold carries poison, and its formation inevitably harms the body. Others, such as *zhìjīn* (铆金) or *gāngjīn* (刚金), possess a naturally harsh and toxic nature, also damaging to the body.

There are three: the third, where *dān* and gold undergo divine transformation and marvelous refinement, its power extending longevity.

Yet the upper-grade minerals, though called *dān*, often contain toxic *qi*, and their formation inevitably harms the body.
Like one parched drinking pigeon broth, or starving feasting on poisoned dried meat—seeking gain yet causing harm, the damage is indeed grave.

In the present age, many scholars and seekers inquire about different methods, yet from the time of **Róngchéng** (容成) to the era of **Péngzǔ** (彭祖), their observations vary. Some have not yet attained perfection, possessing gold but failing to remove its poison, or unable to refine it into true gold.
Even if they succeed, the result is useless.
If they do not carefully refine and select with utmost precision, all efforts are in vain.

Time cannot be delayed—do not wait until the day is over.
All things before life, only longevity is the most precious.
I humbly pray that the **Holy Sage** (圣聪) may heed this and harmonize with the **Heaven-Earth** (天地).

The **Nine *Dān*** are listed below:
1. **Dānhuá** (丹华)
2. **Shénfú** (神符)
3. **Shéndān** (神丹)
4. **Huándān** (还丹)
5. **Èdān** (饵丹)
6. **Liàndān** (炼丹)
7. **Rǔdān** (柔丹)
8. **Fúdān** (伏丹)
9. **Hándān** (寒丹)

These are merely the names of the **Nine *Dān***, their meanings and elucidations appearing in the subsequent volumes.

**The Canon of the Divine *Shéndān* in the Nine Cauldrons by the Yellow Emperor**—Volume 6 ends.
**The Canon of the Divine *Shéndān* in the Nine Cauldrons by the Yellow Emperor**—Volume 7 begins.

The **Canon of the Divine *Shéndān* in the Nine Cauldrons by the Yellow Emperor**—Volume 7 continues:

**Clarifying the Guarding of Oneness, Sealing Evil, and the Construction of the *Dān* House and Cauldron**

The subject humbly submits: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor received the *Dān* scriptures from Xuánnǚ and sought the **True Oneness** (*Zhēnyī*) from the **Royal Sage** (*Huángrén*). Therefore, it is said that the **elixir of immortality** is solely the **golden *dān***, and the **preservation of form and repulsion of evil** depend entirely on the **True Oneness**. The ancients held this in the highest regard.

The **Daoist scriptures** state: The *Jiǔ Zhuǎn Jīndān Jīng* and the **Precepts of Guarding Oneness** are all kept within the **Five Cities of Kunlun**, sealed in **jade cases**, inscribed with **golden tablets**, bound with **purple reishi**, and stamped with the **Central Seal**—these are the supreme secrets of the **Sage of the Highest Virtue**.

The reasons why mortals die are sixfold:
1. **Depletion** (*Sǔn*)
2. **Aging** (*Lǎo*)
3. **The onset of a hundred ailments**
4. **Poison and malevolence**
5. **Harm by malevolent *qi***
6. **Assault by wind and pestilence**

For those who wish to repel evil, they must practice **guiding and drawing** (*Dǎoyǐn*), **circulating *qi***, **returning essence to nourish the brain**, **moderate diet and drink**, **regulated activity and rest**, **meditation on the Oneness**, **wearing talismans and seals**, and **avoiding taboos**. This can ward off malevolence and prevent misfortune, but it cannot prolong life or dispel all diseases.

If one encounters **violent ghosts, raging malevolence, untimely death, or the spread of pestilence and poison**, and the **great elixir is not yet complete**, then these methods alone cannot repel them.

It is like one who removes armor and rain gear—useful only in battle or storms. If there is no war or impending rain, then having or not having them makes no difference.

If arrows and blades clash, swords and spears cross, then it is like being unarmored in battle. If torrential rain pours down or snow blankets the sky, then one knows the danger of standing exposed.

If illness has not yet healed, the **divine *dān*** is not yet refined, one’s lifespan is uncertain, and malevolent forces have not been dispelled, then the **Way of Guarding Oneness** must be known.

**Entering the mountains to guard Oneness**, and the hundred poisons dare not approach. No other methods are needed—the malevolent forces will depart on their own. The method follows, though its details are found in the **Royal Sage’s *Sān Yī* scroll**, so they are not transcribed here.

**Method for Building a Flying *Dān* House**
First, select a deep mountain by flowing water, a secluded cliffside, where humans and beasts are scarce. Hang **talismans and seals**, purify the heart, and observe strict fasting. Remove three *cùn* of old soil from the ground, then fill with fresh earth and level it. Raise a foundation three *chi* high, avoiding old mounds or ruins.

The house should be three *zhàng* long and one *zhàng* six *chǐ* wide, meticulously constructed with good materials, covered with fine grass, and plastered inside and out to be sturdy and sealed. The door should face due south, with two doorways, each four *chǐ* wide, to be closed at dusk. The firelight and the master’s presence determine its use.

Within the house, place the **cauldron** at the center, concealed by a dense barrier, with high walls to prevent intrusion. If the walls are not high or sturdy, heavy rain will breach them—these are the old methods, but current practice differs.

If the site is an **absolute cliffside** or a **prime waterfront location**, being deep in the mountains, one should not overwork the land. Only remove decayed materials, fill with good soil, bury the **seal beneath the cauldron**, and firmly compact it. The *Dān* scriptures also state: To refine the **divine *dān***, one must be in **deep mountains or vast marshes**, or in **remote villages and wilds where no one resides**. If refining is done among people, one must build **high walls and thick barriers**, ensuring no sight or sound passes between inside and out. The space should be small, accommodating only two or three people at most.

First, observe seven days of fasting, bathe with **five fragrant herbs**, and maintain absolute purity—avoid passing through or associating with **impure or mourning households**.

**Method for Repelling Malevolent Ghosts, Evil Spirits, and Thieves in Mountain Dwellings**
When residing in the mountains and fearing malevolent ghosts, take with your **left hand** a **Green Dragon** talisman, fold it in half, and place it beneath the **Blue Star** position. Pass through the **Bright Hall**, enter the **Yin Realm**, and take **Yǔbù** steps while reciting:
*"Nògāo Tàiyīn Jiāngjūn, open only for your descendant [name], and close to outsiders. Those who see this seal shall think it firewood. Those who do not see it shall think it unnatural."*

Then break the accompanying grass and place it on the ground. With your left hand, take soil and transfer it to your **person’s center** (*rénzhōng*). With your right hand, hold the grass to shield yourself, and place your left hand over your heart. Take **Yǔbù** steps until reaching the **Six *Gēng*** position, then hold your breath and stand still—thus, ghosts cannot see you.

The **Six *Jiǎ*** correspond to the **Green Dragon**, the **Six *Yǐ*** to the **Blue Star**, the **Six *Bǐng*** to the **Bright Hall**, and the **Six *Dīng*** to the **Yin Realm**.

When refining **immortal medicines**, use the **Four Seasons’ Sovereign and Minister days**, ensuring the day and hour do not clash. The sky must be clear, the sun and moon bright, and the *qi* tranquil—only then may work begin.

When taking **elixir medicines**, avoid the **five days of yin weather, snow, wind, rain, or heavy dew**. Medicines must be taken in a **tranquil place** for swift and powerful effects.

When consuming elixirs, be cautious of **spicy foods, meat, strong odors, sexual activity, impurity, attending funerals, or mourning**—these are all **great prohibitions**.

This is the **Great Prohibition Talisman for Refining the Supreme Elixir** by **Hújiāngzǐ**.

The courtyard’s **refining chamber** should be **twelve *bù* square**, with a height of **two *zhàng* four *chǐ***. The **south-facing door** should have a **barred gate** in front, ensuring a **continuous stream of water** flows by.

**Bundle the Days and Months.**
Wrap the chamber’s exterior with fragrant clay, sealing each side with a talisman for the **Master Elixir**.

Within the chamber, erect the **Five Sacred Peaks** and **Three Celestial Platforms**. Beneath the western wall, construct a tiered altar, placing all medicinal herbs and sacred elixir scriptures upon it, arranged in order. Let the **Living Medicine Envoys** guard them—then no malevolent *qi* shall dare intrude.

**Method for the Tortoise Foundation:**
At the chamber’s center, fashion a tortoise (*áo*), its mouth facing west. Repair it with fine *bóshí* stone, then grind bitter wine and flowing western water with fine white clay, mixing in *Pútái* clay to seal it. Within the tortoise, install an iron tripod—its legs forged from raw iron, the better. Place the elixir cauldron upon the tripod, ensuring it sits perfectly centered, neither tilted nor askew. On all four sides, maintain a uniform distance of **one *cùn* and a half** from the tortoise’s edge, so that the tortoise rises **two *cùn*** above the cauldron’s rim, encircling it. Constantly feed it with husk-fed fire to maintain even heat, lest the flames wax too strong or too weak.

**Method for the Five Sacred Peaks and Three Celestial Platforms:**
First, shape the forms of the **Five Sacred Peaks**, then within their center, erect the **Three Celestial Platforms**. Construct them with pottery and stone, sealing them with fragrant clay. Some scriptures prescribe alternate methods. If one cannot erect the Five Peaks and Three Platforms, then a **Talisman Chamber** must suffice. Within this chamber, place the tortoise, its perimeter spanning **seven *chǐ*** in breadth. Build it with pottery and stone, using yellow cinnabar clay to seal its exterior.

**Method for the Iron Cauldron and Martial Seal:**
Measure the cauldron’s circumference according to its size, fitting it with three legs, each **one *chǐ* and six *cùn*** high.

**Method for the Earthen Cauldron:**
*The humble servant notes:* The divine vessels for refining elixirs and merging medicines are made of earth, not iron, for the ancients knew well—though diagrams were cast, they were never forged. For the five metals bear poison, and cannot be used recklessly. Thus, in the **Great Elixir Methods**, there is no place for iron implements. Moreover, crafting an earthen cauldron is most difficult—hair’s breadth imperfections cause medicines to scatter and spill. From ancient times, those who labored for years, only to fail in old age, did so because of this flaw. The sages held it in such reverence that they never transmitted the method.

Yet, when making an earthen cauldron, one must use **Six-to-One Clay**—six parts to one, totaling seven. The sages concealed this, hence the name *liùyī* (六一). **Method for Six-to-One Clay:**
Take **alum stone, *rùshí* (誉石), martial salt, and *lǔxián* (卤咸)*,* and roast them for twenty days. Then gather **western-sea facing-left *mǔlì* (牡蛎), red stone pitch, and talc**. Seven substances in total—more or less as needed. Pound them **ten thousand strokes**, sift the finest powder, and knead with **one-hundred-day bitter wine** to form clay pellets.

Those who use elixirs all speak of *liùyī*, though not all employ all seven. Each has their own method, but the key is securing its firmness. For instance, in the **Seven Treasures Unending Pill** transmitted by *Zuǒyuán Fàng* to *Hújiāngzǐ*, the earthen cauldron’s clay is made with **purple quartz, white stone, red stone pitch, *mǔlì* powder, and white talc**, each **twenty *jīn***—pounded and kneaded with a marvelous technique, recorded here among the *liùyī* methods, though only three are used.

Moreover, though *liùyī* serves as cauldron clay, its virtues are profound: **alum stone** lightens the body, strengthens bones, and prolongs life; ***rùshí*** sharpens vision, lowers *qi*, benefits the liver, and quells thirst; **martial salt** repels venomous creatures and fortifies flesh; ***lǔxián*** dispels internal heat and eases nausea, wheezing, and fullness; **red stone pitch** enhances wisdom, banishes hunger, lightens the body, and extends years; **white talc** lightens the body, lengthens life, endures hunger, and quenches thirst. Thus, a cauldron of this clay already carries the power of longevity—hence the ancients’ reliance on it. First, they shaped the **red-earth cauldron** as its skeletal frame, then repeatedly coated it with *liùyī* clay, and finally applied **black-and-yellow elixir** to seal it. Thus, the sequence is as follows:

**Method for the Red-Earth Cauldron:**
Take **parrot-liver red earth**, yellow in hue, and pound it finely through silk, then steam it until midday. Mix with thin wine to form clay, pounding until perfectly refined. Mold **three small and six large** earthen cauldrons—this is the proper count. Alternatively, make additional sets for testing dryness and moisture. Adjust the size according to the medicine’s quantity. Ensure the walls are **five *fèn*** thick, then dry them in shade for **thirty days**. The smaller hold **eight or nine *shēng***, the larger **one and a half *dòu***. Some say to make them **three *fèn*** thick, then bake until utterly dry.

Next, take **thirty *jīn* of *xièsè* (懈树) bark**, finely chopped, and boil it in **three *dàn* of water** for a day. Strain and reduce to **one *shēng***, its color a deep black—this is called *xièsè* lacquer. Apply it to the cauldron’s exterior according to its number, reinforcing its strength so that it neither cracks nor shatters in fire. This is the **secret technique for the divine elixir’s earthen cauldron**.

**Method for the Six-to-One Clay in Forging the Elixir Furnace:**
Take **three hundred *jīn* of eastern-sea facing-left *mǔlì***, scrape away the flesh, and pound it in an iron mortar. Sift through silk into a basin, rinsing with water until it resembles white wine. Stir repeatedly for hundreds of strokes, then let it settle overnight. Decant the water, retaining only the finest sediment. Dry it under the sun. The coarser residue is repounded and resifted as before, then placed in an iron vessel and roasted atop the tortoise’s shell with blazing woodfire for **twenty days**, until its color matches the flame. Let it cool for a day, then resift through silk. Knead with **one-hundred-day medicinal wine** to form clay, applying it with a brush of sheep’s hair to coat the earthen cauldron.

Next, take **native *rùshí*, alum stone, talc, red stone pitch, martial salt, and *lǔxián***, each in equal measure, and pound them without sifting. Roast them for twenty days as well. Then, mix the previously prepared *mǔlì* powder with these seven substances, binding them with vinegar to form clay for coating the cauldron. **One hundred *jīn* of *mǔlì* powder** may suffice, with each of the seven ingredients measured at **two *jīn*** apiece.

「The Method of Sealing with *Mǔlì* Clay

Take fine yellow soil like tallow, expose it to the sun until dry, then pound and sift it, washing with water as in the preparation of *mǔlì* powder. After drying, break it into pieces the size of plums, then roast it with fierce fire for three days until it turns uniformly red like cinnabar. Let it cool completely, then pound and sift it three times, adding one *jīn* of yellow cinnabar (*huángdān*) and one *jīn* of paper ash (*zhǐtū*). Soak it thoroughly, then mix with five *jīn* of *ājiāo* (donkey-hide glue) decoction until sufficient, forming clay with paper ash. Pound it three thousand times, steam it in porcelain for half a day, and apply it to coat the *Liùyī* clay.

**The Method of Sealing the Cinnabar Cauldron with Clay**
Take a red-earth cauldron, first coating its exterior with *mǔlì* clay, five *fēn* thick on the surface and three *fēn* thick on the sides, letting it dry in shade for ten days until thoroughly desiccated. Then apply the *Liùyī* clay again, two *fēn* thick, with five *fēn* thickness on both surface and sides. This is the method of applying *Liùyī* clay without coating the surface.

**Coating the Cauldron**
During the first ten days of coating, the thickness should be five *fēn*. Once coating is complete, let it dry in shade for ten days, then expose it to the sun for another ten days. This ensures the inner and outer layers are each five *fēn* thick, though still thin overall—just twenty days in total.

**The Method of Coating with *Mǔlì* Clay**
The coating process should follow the same duration as the *Liùyī* clay method.

**Sealing the Cinnabar Furnace with *Liùyī* Clay**
After placing the medicine inside, first coat the two cauldron mouths with *Liùyī* clay before sealing them. Then apply *Liùyī* clay to the outer edges, gradually increasing the thickness. Once dry, coat it again, making it over one *cùn* thick, ensuring it is firm and sealed. Next, apply the *Mǔlì* divine clay uniformly, with a thickness of six to seven *fēn* on top—this is ideal.

**Sealing to Form the Cauldron’s Shape**
Seal it so that the cauldron resembles an inverted basin, maintaining its proper goose-egg shape. This is the sealing method.

If not done thus, the *Liùyī* clay, when exposed to fire, will lose its potency, causing the medicine’s essence to dissipate and the seal to crack. Cracks will allow the cinnabar’s essence to escape.

The ancient sage **Ānqī Shī** and **Guǎngchéng Zhàngrén** practiced together for over thirty years. Though Ānqī Shī obtained the cinnabar elixir (*dānjīng*) and was taught the various methods of refining, he was not given this crucial sealing technique. Even after nine refineries, he failed, and only after repeatedly begging did he receive this divine clay method—once applied, the elixir succeeded, and he ascended to **Tàiqīng** (the Supreme Purity).

**The Official’s Reflection**
This method makes sense. I have always doubted why cinnabar elixirs use clay made with horse or sheep wool—wool burns when exposed to fire, leaving hollow spaces. These gaps prevent the clay from sealing properly, allowing the medicine’s *qi* to escape.

When applying the clay, ensure it is completely dry before heating. If still slightly damp, it will crack upon exposure to heat.

Alternatively, one may use **tún clay** (a separate clay sample) to coat other objects, following the same measurements as the cauldron. After testing, remove the sample and examine the cauldron’s seal—whether it is thoroughly dry or not. You may also test by igniting it, observing the cauldron’s readiness.

This method is most critical: after shade-drying, expose it to the sun for ten days. The same applies for those who have already roasted it.

Even if clay objects have dried in shade for hundreds of days, upon heating they will inevitably soften. The presence of vinegar (*cù*) in this clay ensures flexibility, so it must be applied to small cauldrons and tested through multiple roastings.

**The Clay Application Method**
First coat the interior, then the exterior. Construct a lattice framework to guide placement, ensuring uniform thickness and measurements. If preparing round clay samples, adjust the mixture so that it dries evenly—do not let it dry directly in one place. Instead, stop and reposition it. If it rains, place the drying clay indoors near a fire to keep it warm. Since drying time is fixed, do not wait for it to dry naturally, or the schedule will be lost.

**The Method of Mixing Clay**
The clay must be thoroughly kneaded. Use a brush of sheep’s wool, first cleaning the bristles with ash and water, then arranging them in bundles for use.

**The Method of Mixing Clay with Wine**
For mixing *Liùyī* and similar clays, use pure, unrefined wine (*chúnjiǔ*)—no need for *huá pò* (medicinal wine from the *Huáshāng* text). If preparing *jīnshā* (golden sand), follow the established methods; this is not required here.

The scriptures state: *“One-hundred-day”* preparations must be completed within the full hundred days. If extended beyond this period—even to multiple years—it is better.

**The Method of Pounding Medicinal Substances**
For fine sifting of medicinal powders, silk is superior to grinding with a mortar. No further refining is needed.

**The Method of the *Hújiāngzǐ* (Vulpes Vulpes) Divine Cauldron**
Take red-yellow soil from the southern regions, thoroughly washing away impurities, and refine it until its hardness and softness are balanced.

First, shape the cauldron to a depth of seven *cùn* and a width of one *chǐ* two *cùn*, ensuring its edges are even and its walls uniformly thick at one *cùn*. The top and bottom should also be level. All subsequent cinnabar cauldrons should follow this standard.

Adjust size according to the quantity of medicine, forming them all at once. Let them dry in shade for one month, then place them inside an earthen furnace. The cauldron should be positioned first with the **wén** (civil, yin) method, then with the **wǔ** (martial, yang) method.

Once the fire has diminished slightly, remove the cauldron and place it in a clean chamber, ensuring no impurities remain. If the cauldron is not roasted, the process will be more arduous.

**The Method of Mixing *Hújiāngzǐ* Divine Cauldron Clay**
For the divine elixir cauldron, take ten *jīn* of **xuányín** (black silver, mercuric sulfide), one *jīn* of **bìbái** (white bismuth), and five *jīn* of **sān zhuǎn qiānhuáng** (three-time sublimated lead oxide). Layer them in the cauldron, then roast from sunrise to sunset until the lead essence fully emerges, resembling molten gold—this is called **xuánhuáng** (black-yellow elixir).

For the clay mixture: take one *jīn* each of **zǐshíyīng** (purple quartz), **bái shízhī** (white stone pitch), *mǔlì* powder, and **bái huáshí** (white talc). Pound and sift each separately, then knead with the juice of **yīnshòu xuánjīng** (dark animal essence) until pliable. Form into round cakes, dry them in the sun, then stack and roast in a furnace for ten days and nights. Once the fire is extinguished, cover and let it rest for another ten days.

Reknead the cakes, then place them in an iron mortar and pound separately until fine. Add **róngyán** (martial salt) and **lǔxián** (alum), mixing with water until thoroughly moistened. Then blend with *huá pò* (medicinal wine) and simmer into clay. Apply this clay to the cauldron, letting it dry before adding more layers—each layer should be about one *fēn* thick. Three applications suffice.

For coating earthen cauldrons with **xuánhuáng** clay, each layer should be only one *fēn* thick—this is the most divine and effective method.

Always inspect the clay’s surface, ensuring no cracks or exposed fibers. The key is to seal it firmly and securely.

**The Method of Preparing the Divine Cauldron’s *Xuánhuáng* Medicine**
Use ten *jīn* of **xuányín** (black silver), one *jīn* of **bìbái** (white bismuth), and five *jīn* of **sān zhuǎn qiānhuáng** (three-time sublimated lead oxide). Layer and place them in the earthen cauldron, then roast with fierce fire from sunrise to sunset until the lead essence fully emerges, appearing like molten gold—this is the **xuánhuáng** (black-yellow elixir).」

Also known as **Fēiqīng** (Flying Light) and **Fēiliú** (Flying Flow).
Take **húfěn** (arsenic trioxide), and also roast it in an iron vessel until it turns golden—equal in grade to **xuánhuáng** (black-yellow elixir). Pound it ten thousand times, mix with **zuǒwèi** (left flavor), and pound until it becomes a paste.

**The following methods for the Divine Cauldron’s pastes and medicines are not part of the Nine Elixirs’ True Essentials.**
Yet the humble subject has tested them and found them most wondrous, so they are preserved here.
All other secondary methods cannot surpass this supreme technique.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Elixirs’ Divine Elixir Classic, Volume Seven complete.**
**Volume Eight: The Method of Transmuting *Mínghuà* Stone into Water and *Xiāoshí* (Saltpeter)**

**Preface to *Mínghuà* Stone and Water**
The humble subject has heard that in all cases of refining the Great Elixir, none can do without the power of **Mínghuà** stone and divine water.

The method of this water, though originating with the Yellow Emperor, was perfected in the Zhou dynasty through the **Bāgōng’s Thirty-Six Waters** (Eight Master’s Thirty-Six Waters).
The Eight Master refers to the teacher of the Han **Huáinán Wáng** (Addison King), **Ān Zhī** (安之).
**Liú Ān** (刘安), the Han **Huáinán Wáng** (Addison King), was the grandson of Emperor **Gāozǔ** (High Founder) and son of the **Lì Wáng** (Lethal King).
At that time, the nobles of the world all indulged in hunting and feasting with dogs and horses in the capital.
The King alone cherished the Dao of immortality, revered its sacred arts, and expounded on the Way of the Transcendent.
When he heard of those who practiced the arts of transformation and alchemy, even if they were a thousand miles away, he would send humble words and rich gifts to invite them.
They gathered like clouds, numbering thousands.

He compiled **《Nèishū》** (Inner Scriptures) in twenty-one chapters, **《Zhōngpiān》** (Middle Treatises) in eight volumes, and **《Hóngbǎo Fāng》** (Precious Treasures’ Methods) in three volumes.
He then dispatched messengers far and wide, and the Eight Master descended, moved by the King’s earnest plea to become his teacher.
Initially, the gatekeepers would not admit the Eight Master, but he presented himself in the guise of an old man and a youth.
The disciples reported this to the King, who, without stepping outside, extended his arm to summon the Master onto the **Sīxiān Zhītái** (Thought-Immortal Platform).
He set up a brocade pavilion, offered gold and jade, and took the posture of a disciple, beseeching the Master for the elixir of longevity.
The Eight Master said: *"To cultivate the Way of immortality, one must first refine the divine elixir—only then can one attain eternal life."*

*"I can transmute pastes into gold, condense mercury into silver, and with this water, transmute eight stones, causing them to fly and rise like pearls.
I can also transform the five metals and condense the seven treasures.
Those who consume it can ride the cloud dragon, float in the **Tàiqīng** (Great Clarity), enter and exit the **Zǐquè** (Purple Gate), and feast in the **Xuándū** (Mysterious Metropolis).
This is the marvel of ascending on clouds and transforming into feathers.
The King should earnestly practice it."*

**Liú Ān** (Addison King) repeatedly knelt and wept, begging for the elixir of longevity.
The Eight Master, pitying him, taught him the **《Wǔlíng Shéndān Shàngjīng》** (Five Spirits’ Divine Elixir Upper Classic) and the **Thirty-Six Waters’ Methods**.
**Liú Ān** (Addison King) then ascended the platform, swore an oath, and knelt in blood before the golden vessel to receive the divine elixir’s method.
He ignited the furnace and succeeded in refining the medicine.
Later, **Liú Ān** (Addison King) was concealed by the Five Spirits and presented to the Emperor.
The Emperor, enraged, dispatched the **Zōngzhèng** (Clan Director) with a scepter to arrest **Liú Ān** (Addison King).
The Eight Master reprimanded him: *"Alas, **Ān Zhī** (安之) can now be removed!"*
*"Those who possess the records of the immortals—if they plot, they die; if they transgress, their clans are exterminated.*
*Yet **Liú Ān** (Addison King) has not long since received them, and this is what the Eight Master warned."*

He then told **Liú Ān** (Addison King): *"Heaven has decreed such fate—how can the King not regret it?"*
The Eight Master then led **Liú Ān** (Addison King) to **Lǐngshān** (Sacred Mountain) for a grand sacrifice, and on that very day, he ascended to Heaven.
Near the great stone where he stood, the imprint of his body and horse remains visible to this day, so that even now, the rooster crows in the sky and the dog barks at the clouds.

In ancient times, the **Tàijí Zhēnrén** (Great Polarity True Person) passed down this divine method and the water-stone techniques to the **Jīnghǎi Qīngtóng Jūn** (Jade Sea Young Master).
The Young Master taught **Jīnlóu Xiānshēng** (Golden Tower Immortal Sage), who in turn taught the Eight Master.
The Eight Master then taught **Liú Ān** (Addison King), and on the day **Liú Ān** (Addison King) ascended to Heaven, he passed it to **Zuǒ Hào** (左昊).
**Zuǒ Hào** (左昧) was the one **Liú Ān** (Addison King) cherished.
As he departed, he told **Zuǒ Hào** (左昧): *"If you seek longevity, you must refine the divine elixir.
Once the divine elixir is complete, you may do as you please."*

However, these alchemical methods transmitted by the immortals are but the **Wǔlíng Shéndān** (Five Spirits’ Divine Elixir).
Though their preparation requires great caution and the selection of stones and medicines is akin to that of the Nine Elixirs, their efficacy is inferior to the **Huángdì Jiǔdǐng Shéndān** (Yellow Emperor’s Nine Elixirs’ Divine Elixir).
Yet since the **Mínghuà** stone water method originates from the Eight Master, it is thus recorded in full below.

**Method of *Huángfán* (Yellow Alum) Stone Water**
For refining the **Nine Elixirs’ Divine Elixir**, all mercury must be detoxified.
The method of detoxification cannot be achieved without **Mínghuà** stone water, for the poison will not be fully removed.
Now, the following methods all require fifty days to complete—adhering to ancient traditions, the days are not increased.

Take one *jīn* of **Mínghuà** stone (yellow alum), excluding **mǎchǐ** (horse teeth alum), and place it in a **qīngzhú tǒng** (green bamboo tube).
Thinly shave the exterior of the tube, cover it with **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) in four *liǎng* portions above and below, seal the mouth with lacquer, and immerse it in the **huápí** (flower pond).
After forty days, the water will form, which can then be mixed and applied to iron, copper, or bronze to achieve a **qīngzhú tǒng** (green bamboo tube)-like hue.

All methods employ this, and for every ten tubes, one *dǒu* (dou) of water is obtained.
Calculate the required amount of medicine accordingly, adding three *liǎng* of **shí dǎn** (stone bile).

Another method: Take three *jīn* of **Mínghuà** stone and place it in a **shēngzhú tǒng** (live bamboo tube).
Thinly shave the exterior, tightly seal the mouth, and bury it in damp soil for five days until water forms.

Yet another method: First, soak the **Mínghuà** stone in pure **chúnzhuì** (unadulterated wine) until it is thoroughly moistened.
Then place it in the tube, cover the mouth with two *liǎng* of **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) and seal it with lacquer.
Bury it three *chǐ* (feet) deep in the earth for fifteen days until water forms.

**Method of *Xuánzhū* (Black Pearl)**
Take one *jīn* of **Mínghuà** stone, three *liǎng* of **shí dǎn** (stone bile), and cover it above and below in the tube.
Seal the mouth with lacquer and immerse it in the **huápí** (flower pond) for fifty days until water forms.
All three methods employ **Xuánzhū** (black pearl) in equal measure.

**Method of the Three Essences and Six Liquids**
Take one *jīn* of **báifān shí** (white alum stone) and place it in a **qīngzhú tǒng** (green bamboo tube).
Thinly shave the exterior, cover it with two *liǎng* of **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) above and below, seal the mouth with lacquer, and immerse it in the **huápí** (flower pond) for forty days until water forms.

**Another Method for Refining the Nine Elixirs’ Divine Elixir: The Hundred Steaming and Nine Flying Method**
Take one *jīn* of **xiónghuáng** (realgar) and place it in a bamboo tube.
Add four *liǎng* of **xiāoshí** (saltpeter), seal it as per the method, and immerse it in the **huápí** (flower pond) for forty days until water forms.

**Another Method:**
Take two *liǎng* of **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) and place it in a **tángdì** (clay pot) containing bitter wine within a sealed tube. Bury it in the courtyard, three *chǐ* underground, and after twenty days, water will form—sweet in taste, yellow and turbid in color.

**Method for Refining Cinnabar Water:**
Take one *jīn* of **dānshā** (cinnabar) and place it in a fresh bamboo tube. Add two *liǎng* each of **shídǎn** (stone gall) and **xiāoshí** (saltpeter), then seal it in a **tángdì** containing bitter wine. Bury it in the courtyard, three *chǐ* underground, and after twenty days, water will form—sweet in taste, yellow and turbid in color.

**Another Method:**
Take one *jīn* of **dānshā** (cinnabar) and place it in a fresh bamboo tube. Add two *liǎng* of **shídǎn** (stone gall) and four *liǎng* of **xiāoshí** (saltpeter), seal it with lacquer as before, and immerse it in the **huápí** (flower pond) for thirty days until water forms.

**Another Method:**
Add two *liǎng* each of **shídǎn** (stone gall) and **xiāoshí** (saltpeter), seal it in a **tángdì**, and bury it as above. After thirty days, water will form—bitter in taste, red in color.

**Note by the Scholar:**
The methods for transforming **fánshí** (alum stone), **xiónghuáng** (realgar), and **dānshā** (cinnabar) into water all follow the *Bā Gōng Sānshíliù Shuǐ Zhèngjīng* (Eight Masters’ Canon of Thirty-Six Waters). All methods rely on **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) to achieve this. For transforming **dānshā** (cinnabar), **shídǎn** (stone gall) is also required.

Among the great elixirs, **róngyán** (martial salt) is essential. Though the Four Seas are now peaceful and all medicines are abundant, **xiāoshí** (saltpeter) alone remains scarce. Common folk may claim to produce water without it, or mix other substances to simulate **xiāoshí**, yet their transformations lack true efficacy. After careful investigation, I fear these methods fall short of authenticity. Thus, I record substitutes below.

**Method for Simulating Alum Stone Water with Alternative Substances:**
Take three *jīn* of **fánshí** (alum stone), grind it into powder, and place it on a mulberry-wood tray over a heated charcoal bed. After the tray has been heated overnight, sprinkle bitter wine onto the hot surface, then spread the alum powder evenly across it. Enclose the tray’s edges with white ash, wait until the heat dissipates, then remove the ash and scrape off the residue. Place it in three *dòu* of bitter wine—one *jīn* of alum to one *dòu* of wine—and steep it for seven days. When ready, boil it quickly, then let it steep for a hundred days for optimal results.

The proportions of ingredients and bitter wine may be adjusted as needed at the time of use.

**Method for Simulating Crude Saltpeter (Mángxiāoshí):**
This refers to **pǔxiāo** (crude saltpeter), not true **xiāoshí** (saltpeter). Take **pǔxiāo** and **xiāoshí**, grind them coarsely without fine sifting, and rinse the **pǔxiāo** with warm water until the liquid is clear. Boil it in any quantity, reducing it by half. Pour the concentrated solution into a small basin and add **língshuǐ** (pure water) to steep overnight. The next day, it will crystallize into angular fragments resembling white quartz. Handle it carefully to avoid contamination—if others touch it, the **qì** (vital essence) will dissipate, and the transformation will fail. Only **língshuǐ** (pure water) should be used for steeping; any impurity will hinder the process. This method ensures swift and effective transformation for all elixir waters.

**Method for Simulating Martial Salt (Róngyán) with Alternative Substances:**
Take clear **shíguàn** (stone salt) in any quantity, melt it in an iron vessel until boiling, then pour it over **báifánshí** (white alum stone) powder. Remelt and pour into brine, then remelt and pour over **gānyán** (dry salt) powder, covering it completely. Repeat this threefold refining process to produce **róngyán**. Its transformative power will match that of the genuine article.

This salt is the master of all medicines. If refining the **Wǔsè Shényán** (Five-Colored Divine Salt) or the **Wǔdì Jīng** (Essence of the Five Emperors), simply add it to achieve the desired result.

**Method for Simulating Stone Gall (Shídǎn) with Alternative Substances:**
Take two *jīn* of **qīngfánshí** (green vitriol), one *jīn* of **huángfán** (yellow vitriol), and one *jīn* of **báishānzhī** (white mountain resin). Melt them in a large iron vessel until boiling, then quickly add two *jīn* of **zhēncāngqīng** (true indigo) powder, stirring vigorously to form a paste. This yields **shídǎn**. Alternatively, if the vitriols do not fully melt, add **zhēncāngqīng** to the boiling mixture, stir with bitter water until dissolved, then pour into the vitriol mixture to form a paste, which also produces **shídǎn**.

**Method for Simulating Saltpeter (Xiāoshí) with Alternative Substances:**
Take one *jīn* each of **shípí** (stone spleen), **pǔxiāo** (crude saltpeter), and **mángxiāo** (niter). Grind each into powder, then mix with three *dòu* of bitter wine in a copper pot and boil until tenfold reduction. Strain to collect the clear liquid, then simmer gently until it thickens into a paste. Pour it into porcelain vessels and steep in **língshuǐ** (pure water) overnight. The next morning, it will crystallize like frost or ice. When water is added, it dissolves instantly. Reboil the solution, thicken it again, and return it to the porcelain vessel for another steeping in **língshuǐ**. Repeat this process, but be cautious—each refinement weakens its potency. Avoid contamination and shield it from wind and sunlight.

**Shípí** (stone spleen) is the condensed **qì** of yin and yang, the essence of the Five Salts, nurtured by alum and borne by stone. It is found in Éméi Mountain, yet common folk remain unaware of its existence. Only those who seek the Dao recognize its necessity.

The ancients, unable to find the true essence from the four directions, made substitutes that surpassed the genuine. **The method of creating a substitute for *shípí* (stone spleen):**

Take one *jīn* of true **white alum** (*zhēnbáifánshí*), one *jīn* of **military salt** (*róngyán*), and pound both finely. Then, take two *shēng* of **bitter water** (*kǔshuǐ*), place it in a copper pot, and simmer until it boils four or five times. Add the two substances, simmer until half has evaporated, then remove the dregs before boiling completely dry. The residue will rise in the pot like frost or snow—**the substitute *shípí*** (*dàiyòng shípí*), white as snow.

Use this to imitate **língshuǐ** (pure water), and it will work without fail. The marvelous and efficacious Dao is now complete.

**Master Peng** said: The true **língshuǐ** (pure water), **military salt** (*róngyán*), **stone gall** (*shípí*), and **mirabilite** (*mángxiāoshí*)—though some may possess the proper yin-yang essence—are only truly divine in their transformation and efficacy.

If one seeks immortality yet does not master this Dao, they will waste ten thousand *jīn* in vain and never succeed. The substitute *shípí* is one such substance; common folk cannot distinguish it, but its imitations all retain its nature, thus serving the purpose.

Among the **divine elixirs of longevity** (*chángshēng shényào*) compiled by **Ge Hong**, none are as precious or transformative as this method.

Now I, **Hong**, record it to show those who follow the same Way. To those unworthy—even kin—this secret is not passed for ten thousand *jīn*.

「太一曰：余闻三十六水，患在硝石。黄白之中，碍乎戎盥。
　　今具得之，道无以妄传之。后学共宝守，勿示非人。

**假别药作束野硝石法**
此药入河车，用不关丹所用也。恐合炼之际见现，俱别药成，谓便通用。今故别疏出，唯入河车。
若作河车，此硝石其药无力。今作之法，取卤咸末五斗，取三年不食井水七斗半，煮之十沸，洒取清三斗，加**芒硝**十两，煎至一斗，再以**朴硝**二斤末之，投此汁中，朴硝皆消。乃下火，澄去滓，取上用此合河车，乃诸药皆有效验耳。

**诀曰**：言束野者，束野咸味所出，河束之地也。河车法中言**晋硝**者，是此束野物也。此东野法，亦是太一於元君边，闻八种硝石法中一法也。行各偶对，不得错以河车之药，误者是**神丹**之硝石也。

**速成水法**
狐刚子注《珠经》末云：其**神泉**亦中。诸水法自有正本三十六水方，更无别作。若欲令**神泉**速成，即须着华池瓮炊宠上铁圈，承底以马通火若糠火，去瓮底七寸，置筒於瓮中，温之七十日，但令才温，好谨伺候。若作诸金石之水，尽着中同作无妨。

**作三转酒法**

Its taste is bitter, yet without poison. In the third month, it is gathered from the Red Mountain, and when water is applied to raw saltpeter, it dissolves immediately. Its therapeutic effects differ slightly from those of *nitre* (硝石).

According to this account, it is indeed refined *mirabilite* (芒硝) transformed into true *nitre*, but the nature of *stone spleen* (石脾) remains unclear. Since Huangfu is from the An Ding region and well-versed in medicine and herbs, he may have further clarified its refinement. Nowadays, people from Yi Province refine *alum stone* (矾石) into *nitre*, though the resulting product, though smooth and white in taste, remains fundamentally *alum stone*.

The *Kong Shi’s Prescriptions for Decoction* states: When refining *nitre*, one must boil until the liquid is entirely evaporated and ceases to bubble—yet even then, the *nitre* retains some residual liquid. The *nitre* employed by Daoist immortals must be capable of dissolving other stones, though its full potential remains unexplored.

Moreover, raw saltpeter is found in Yi Province, specifically in the mountains between the counties of Gu and Canling in Shi Province (蚕陵). It appears mostly greenish-white, sometimes with mixed irregular patches. Common folk select the white, soft portions for use as *nitre*, boiling them until the liquid bubbles forth, resembling the form of *alum stone*.

The Daoist canon repeatedly states that *nitre* can dissolve other stones. This text also asserts its ability to dissolve stone—if true, it must be so. Each should test it for themselves.

The canon further declares that raw saltpeter can refine seventy-two kinds of stone, rendering them as white as silver. When ingested, it grants lightness of body and immortality. It already encompasses eight qualities—cold, heat, astringency, slipperiness, pungency, bitterness, saltiness, and sourness—and can additionally dissolve stone. Thus, the efficacy of raw saltpeter does not differ from that of *nitre*.

The precept reads: True *nitre* is rare to obtain in good form; if not refined properly, it cannot dissolve *realgar* (雄黄) or *cinnabar* (丹砂) into liquid. If one secures the genuine substance, first extract a few *liang* (两) of *nitre* and test its ability to dissolve *realgar* and other stones. Observe whether it succeeds or fails—if it cannot dissolve stone, it is not the true substance.

Its appearance is nearly identical to raw saltpeter, yet slightly hollow and soft. To determine its authenticity, place a fragment upon burning coals: if a violet hue emerges and it then reduces to ash, it is superior. If it bubbles vigorously for an extended time, it is raw saltpeter. Given its rarity, one must also verify its efficacy by testing it with *realgar* and *cinnabar* waters—otherwise, its authenticity cannot be confirmed.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon*, Volume Eight, concludes. The *Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon*, Volume Nine, concludes.

「The method of refining and ingesting gold and silver according to their purity and efficacy is as follows: Your servant has heard that gold and silver—these two treasures—can pacify the mind and internal organs. This is why the method of *Hújiāngzǐ* refining the *Xuányú* (玄珠) involves using them to bind and retain.

However, one must carefully select gold’s quality, for its efficacy cannot be overlooked. If silver is mixed with impurities, its hue will be greenish-yellow; if gold is mixed, its hue will be purplish-red. When burned, it leaves black soot upon the flesh, rendering it useless. True refined gold, by contrast, is a bright yellow-red, enduring even a hundred refinements without depletion. Though one may obtain it, it must still be hammered into thin sheets and subjected to common refining methods: salted earth is used to temper it for one day and night, then removed and repeatedly melted, hammered, and tempered until its heat is exhausted and it no longer burns. Thus, gold meant for ingestion cannot be sourced from the marketplace—it must be refined and prepared accordingly.

In ancient times, *Hújiāngzǐ* devised the *Seven Refinements* method for gold powder, all of which involved hammered gold. Now, when combined with the *Divine Elixir*, it is also proper to use hammered gold, with the freshly refined being superior. In general, when ingesting gold or silver, their toxicity must be fully eliminated before consumption is possible. Therefore, *Hújiāngzǐ* established that all five types of gold possess poison; if not fully refined to remove the poison and made into powder, even if one pretends to achieve transformation and concocts the *Great Elixir of the Divine Dan*, its lingering toxicity will, upon prolonged ingestion or slight violation of prohibitions, inevitably kill. Hence, *Hújiāngzǐ* left behind records on hammered gold, and now we extract their essentials, listing them as follows:

Hammered gold may be found either in water or within mountains. That found in water or on mountainous terrain beneath water resembles *millet husks*, *millet grains*, *dates*, or *glutinous rice grains*, buried one *cùn* (寸) to seven *cùn* deep in sand, stone, or earth—this is the *gold of the north-south flowing waters*, located on the eastern bank. Buried five *cùn* to nine *cùn* deep, this is called the *gold of the east-west flowing waters*, found on the southern bank and produced—all of which are the finest, superior gold.

That found in mountains is uniformly round, with veins facing the sun, buried nine *chǐ* (尺) to ninety *chǐ* deep in mixed sand, stone, and earth, displaying a red-yellow hue, fine and smooth, heavy and dense. When broken, it does not shatter; when melted by fire, it turns white like silver. After being stirred with medicines and subjected to the *Eight Winds* (八风) furnace with stone-washing, this is called the *gold of the east-west mountains*. In the northern shaded regions, it grows with water and sand intermingled, buried in stone and earth—its depth varying as above. With veins facing the sun, buried seven *chǐ* deep, its form and quality resemble the previous, and this is called the *gold of the south-north mountains*. That found in the western shaded regions is called the *second-grade gold*. It is then stirred white and subjected to the *Eight Winds* furnace with stone-washing, refined as before.

If hammered gold appears in water or on mountainous terrain but is exposed on the surface, not buried in the *yin-yang* (阴阳) regions of the west, south, or north, and has sharp edges—whether large or small—with a greenish-yellow hue, it is all of *iron nature*, resembling gold yet unfit for use.

**Method for Refining Water-Sourced Hammered Gold:**
Use sweet clay to fashion a crucible, dry it with smoke, and place pinewood charcoal in the furnace. Then, immerse the hammered gold in the crucible and ignite the furnace fiercely. Next, add salt powder and stir it in. When fully melted, use a *jīng* (荆) branch to skim away impurities. Pour out the molten gold and repeatedly stir in salt. Skim away all impurities until the grease and membrane are exhausted. Hammer and break it, then filter with iron vinegar to make it into fine shavings. Mix with equal parts cow dung ash and salt, and place it back in the furnace with cow dung fire. Temper it in sand and repeatedly melt and hammer until it becomes soft. Then, apply a coating of equal parts *huángfán* (黄矾) stone and *Hútónglǜ* (胡同律), melt it with fire until red, and cease. Repeat the burning four or five times until it becomes superior red gold. Apply the remaining medicine.

Other methods, though varied, are all fallacious—deceiving only the ears. If one seeks to make thin gold sheets or gold paste for ornamentation, melt one *jīn* (斤) of gold with equal parts *stone sulfur* (石硫黄) and *copper acetate* (曾青), each one *liǎng* (两), in a crucible and stir. It will then soften and be malleable as desired. If the impurities persist even after one round of tempering with cow dung ash, repeat the process until all impurities are removed.

**Subsequent Method for Tempering with Tin:**
Use equal parts *huángfán* (黄矾) stone, *Hútónglǜ* (胡同律), and salt, mixed with vinegar to form a paste. If these are unavailable, simply melt the gold from the mountains and refine it.

**Method for Hammered Gold:**
Take two *liǎng* each of *gold essence* (金精), *stone gall* (石胆), *cinnabar* (朱砂), *realgar* (雄黄), *stone sulfur* (石硫黄), *raw saltpeter* (朴硝), *calcined sand* (炮砂), and *white alum* (白矾), and one *liǎng* of *qílín scales* (麒鳞竭). Grind the *qílín scales* into powder, soak them in vinegar within porcelain, and place them in a furnace with chaff fire—do not let them boil, only simmer until they are decomposed, from *Chén* (辰) hour to *Wǔ* (未) hour. Remove and mix with five *liǎng* each of *honey myrobalan* (蜜陀僧) and *purple quartz* (紫石英), and one *jīn* of salt.

Grind all twelve medicinal substances into powder. In a separate copper vessel, melt eight *liǎng* of *mercury* (水银) with vinegar, applying a small, intense fire beneath. In another iron vessel, melt tin and pour it into the mercury, where they will combine harmoniously. When the vinegar is nearly exhausted, add another *dǒu* (斗) of it. Repeat this until two *dǒu* of vinegar have been used. Then, take all the medicines, place them in a porcelain vessel, and mix them simultaneously with the mercury to form the elixir in half a day.

Grind the fine hammered gold into fragments, resembling *glutinous rice grains*. Combine ten *jīn* of hammered gold with two *liǎng* of medicine and ten *liǎng* of *huángfán* (黄矾) stone powder, and place them in the *Eight Winds* furnace with *chengliǔ* (程柳) wood charcoal. Stir both hard and soft gold evenly, ensuring the fire penetrates fully, until its force is exhausted. If the gold is not fully refined, subject it to another round in the furnace—there will be none that fail to refine. Use fine sand in a basin to collect the refined gold, resembling *millet husks* or *fine sugar crystals*, which must be kept separate from the gold.»

「Take one *dòu* of cow dung ash, half a *shēng* of salt powder, and two *liǎng* of refined gold sand, mix them thoroughly, and combine with *xuánjīng* water to form a paste like a chicken egg. Dry it by fumigation, then return it to the cow dung fire. If it is well-done, stop after one round. If not, repeat the process until it is ready before consumption.

To further refine it, take the residue from the crucible, melt it in a basin, pour it into a thin layer of fat membrane, and flatten it. Mix equal parts of *hútónglǜ* (胡同律) and *huángfán* stone powder with vinegar to form a thin paste, apply it, and burn until the color emerges like the method for *shuǐjīn* (水金). This yields the finest gold.

For coating objects with thin gold paste, follow the previous method: for every *jīn* of gold, use one *liǎng* each of *huángfán* and *céngqīng* (曾青), melt and stir them in a crucible until they become pliable and malleable for use.

If the gold lacks sharp edges (*wúlěngjiǎo* 無楞角), add one *liǎng* of the previous medicine and ten *liǎng* of *huángfán* stone powder for every ten *jīn* of gold. If the gold is not genuine, forcing its refinement is merely wasted effort.

When the medicinal *qi* is exhausted and the *xīnghuà* (星化) essence dissipates, it becomes iron—regrettably, not a single *zhū* (铢) remains. Only true substances yield results.

If *qílín* (麒麟) scales are unavailable in the medicinal division, substitute them with *zǐjīn* (紫金). This also works.

**Method for the Eight Winds Furnace (*Bāfēng Wòlú* 八风沃炉) and Refining Tin Ash**

First, refine lead and tin twenty times in a sweet clay crucible. Use three *jīn* of refined tin in a cast-iron pot, melt it until it glows red and boils, then add one *jīn* of crushed gold-tin mixture. Skim off the dross and pour out the liquid.

Prepare fully charred firewood ash. Build a square furnace with clay bricks, lining it with refined ash as a mold. Place the gold-tin mixture in the center, cover it with an iron lid, and arrange hard charcoal above. Punch a hole in the furnace top and a small vent at the front. After a short time, the tin and gold will separate—take the gold, which resembles silver. Mix it with refined *qīhuáng* (雌黄) and good wine, boil it in a copper vessel to restore its original nature. If not fully refined, flatten it, refine it again, and extract the color as before.

Once the true tin is refined, place it on the iron lid, mix equal parts of *hútónglǜ*, *huángfán* stone, and salt with vinegar into a paste, and coat the tin ingot. Surround it with cow dung fire on all sides until the tin is fully consumed, leaving only gold. Transfer the gold to a cast-iron pan, mix it with *huángfán* stone and water, boil it for half a day, then melt and cast it into an ingot.

The dross from the furnace must also be refined using the same method and proportions.

---
**Purification of Tin by Submersion (*Xī Tóu Niúzhī* 锡投牛脂) Method**
Immerse tin in cow fat, red soil, then in *pútāo* (蒲挑) juice and mustard seed broth, followed by pear tea ash liquid, black *xǐ* (盥) rock wine, and *làngyánzi* (浪岩子) barley wine—each immersion seven times yields refined tin.

---
**Method for *Chìyán* (赤盐, Red Salt)**
Grind one *jīn* of *huángfán* stone and eight *liǎng* of rock salt into powder, melt them in an iron vessel until the color turns fully red. Let it cool to form *chìxǐ* (赤盥), then grind it into powder for use.

---
**Huzi’s Refining Method**
The medicinal division requires *jīnjīng* (金精), *céngqīng*, *zhūshā* (朱砂), and *xiónghuáng* (雄黄). If not fully refined, using them wastes thousands of *jīn* without gaining even a fraction of true gold. *Shídǎn* (石胆) must also be refined to extract its essence.

For *jīnjīng* and *céngqīng*, place one substance in a porcelain vessel, soak it in three cycles of *zuǒwèi* (左味) for 200 days, then dry and grind it finely for use.

For *zhūshā* and *xiónghuáng*, soak them in porcelain with good spring wine for 100 days, dry, and grind finely for use.

---
**Refining *Shídǎn* to Extract Its Essence**
Build two square clay furnaces, two *chǐ* apart, each lined with fine clay and vented on the sides. Place a copper basin in one furnace, seal it tightly with clay. In the other, burn *shídǎn* until its essence vaporizes and condenses into the copper basin. Once cooled, open the furnace and use the refined essence in any elixir—it enhances all medicines.

**Hujiangzi’s Six Gold Furnace Methods**
There are six furnace methods for refining gold, depending on its nature and quantity. Only one method is needed—no need to perform all, as that wastes effort. The two most effective methods are illustrated as before.

---
**Extracting Silver from Ore**
If the silver is already bright white, roast it with *bái fán* (白矾) and *shípào* (石炮) powder to refine it. If it remains impure, mix one *jīn* of crude silver with one *jīn* of refined lead, then filter the ash to produce superior white silver.

---
**Mold for Ash Refining (*Huīzhú* 灰逐) in a Clay Furnace**
Build a clay furnace chamber three *chǐ* high, with adjustable length. Inside, create a mold to hold the refined ash, ensuring it is fully compacted and neither too wet nor too dry. Press the ash firmly, then carve the desired shape with a knife. Sprinkle a thin layer of salt powder over the ash where the metal will flow, cover it with yellow clay, and arrange charcoal above. Seal the furnace with clay, leaving ventilation holes at the top and sides. Poke small holes at intervals to monitor progress with an iron hook, skimming off dross as it rises.

Once the fire penetrates, the tin and gold will boil and swirl, separating completely. When the tin is fully consumed and the silver stops moving, a purple-green luster emerges. Strike the surface lightly with a rod, dampen it with water, and the silver will solidify. Lift the "dragon head" mold, use an iron spoon to collect the silver—this is called *lóngtóu bái yín* (龙头白银, Dragon-Head White Silver).

---
**Clay Furnace Mold and Tin Dross Refining Method**
Hammer an iron mold to the desired size, with staggered holes (each fitting an arrow) to prevent clay leakage. Shape the mold like a tortoise shell, line it with refined ash, and compress it evenly. Cover with salt powder, arrange the ash, and monitor as before. Follow the same refining steps.

「Only when the fire beneath the iron mold is made fierce does the tin descend rapidly and separate. Next is the method for refining tin dross from the mold:

Hu Gāngzǐ says: When refining silver, there are three methods. First, gauge the amount of dross and make one furnace accordingly—this avoids unnecessary effort. Now, I present the two most essential methods, setting the mold as before.

**Method for expelling tin from the mold’s center:**
After the silver is refined, quickly mix oil and sulfur powder, pour the fat through the silver-refining holes into the mold’s center. When flames rise, use an iron rod to scrape beneath the dross holes, stirring vigorously within the mold. The tin will reemerge, flowing downward into clusters.

**Method for steaming and refining the dross within the mold:**
The refined silver dross must be steamed to remove its slippery residue, then hammered until thoroughly mellowed—this yields far more silver. If the dross is not refined well, the silver yield will be much less. If the mold cracks mid-process, the tin will spill out, and the silver will be lost. Thus, one must strike and refine it meticulously, using the finest charcoal ash from burned mulberry bark, which also works well.

**Method for refining silver with medicinals:**
Prepare the following:
- Raw realgar (雄黄) – 1 liang
- White quartz (白石英) – 1 liang
- Roasted sand (炮砂) – 1 liang
- Steamed *zhōngwǎn* stone (戎盥石胆) – 1 liang
- White alum (白矾) – 1 liang
- Green vitriol (青矾) – 10 liang

The secret is: For refining silver, it is specifically said to use raw realgar. If one follows the refining method for gold, which includes realgar, it must be roasted like cinnabar (丹砂). It is known that realgar lacks fixed properties—raw realgar produces a silver hue, while roasted realgar yields a golden one.

Grind the above seven medicinals into fine powder. Take four liang of mercury (水银) and two liang of tin (锡), place them in a small crucible. Pour vinegar over the mercury, apply intense fire beneath the tin, melt the tin in an iron vessel, and pour it into the mercury mixture. Boil with two *dòu* of vinegar until it is fully spent, then transfer it into a porcelain container. Mix all seven powders together at once, grinding them thoroughly until they harmonize.

When the tin in the mold’s center ceases to move and the purple-green luster (文园) appears, scatter this refined powder into the mold like dates. The tin must then become lively again, and the purple-green luster must vanish—this ensures rapid extraction of the tin.

**Refining gold and silver with charcoal:**
Gold requires charcoal from willow wood, pine, or *wú* wood, as well as dried cow dung—all must be firm and slightly damp in nature. When burned, they will refine the gold.

Only green wood charcoal, when dry, can be used directly for refining gold. When applied to the *lóngtóu* (Dragon-Head) furnace, the gold will flow out effortlessly, requiring minimal labor and yielding the most gold.

For silver, copper, and iron, use charcoal from hardwood. For tin, burning pine wood or hardwood charcoal also works.

**Method for producing a silver-white medicinal:**
Take white plums (白梅子) and black plums (乌梅子) from Sichuan, steam them until tender in a copper vessel. Use one *dòu* of water, two *shēng* of plums, one *shēng* of vinegar, and one *shēng* of salt powder, boiling them together until thoroughly cooked. Take the refined silver, hammer it thin, heat it until red in the fire, and press it into the plum juice. The silver must be fully immersed in the juice.

Repeat the process—boil, heat, and immerse—for about half a day. The silver will become lustrous, and its surface will turn entirely white. If the fire is not adjusted properly, there is another method: mix roasted sand with water and immerse the silver directly—it will turn white.

**Softening the superior gold:**
To soften the superior gold (上金), dissolve it in *jīng* wine (荆酒) for ten days, allowing it to permeate thoroughly. In one day, it will become supple and smooth. If one prepares it as a gold elixir (金液), softening it first is even better.

**Refining gold method:**
Take unused gold, dissolve it in sweet wine, and immerse it for three hundred cycles. It will no longer boil, and when held, it will ooze between the fingers—this is called refined gold. Only those who can meticulously refine their elixirs will attain *Tàiqīng* (太清, Supreme Clarity).

The refining of silver is the same. With this softened substance, hammer it thin, prepare it as a gold elixir, and apply it with great care.

**Refining gold and silver elixirs:**
Dissolve newly refined gold and silver in clear wine, pure fermented wine, or genuine honey, for two hundred cycles. They will become supple and smooth, and when held, they will ooze between the fingers. Even if steeped for many days, they remain suitable for elixirs.

Dissolve and immerse them in guess oil (猜脂) for two hundred cycles—they will also form supple gold. Hammer it thin, cut it finely, and mix it with non-toxic mercury to form a paste.

For every one liang of gold, mix with six liang of mercury, adding half a small bowl of cooked barley. Grind them together in an iron mortar with a pestle until finely pulverized. When the mixture is sufficiently refined, pour it into a basin and remove the stones with water and sand. Examine it carefully, ensuring no gold is lost with the stones.

Wrap the paste in two layers of cloth and twist to remove half the mercury. Take the remaining mercury paste, place it in a porcelain container, and gradually add white salt powder. Grind it until it breaks apart, adding salt until it reaches about half a small bowl, then stop grinding. Sift the residue, regrind it until fine, and then place it in an earthen pot, covering it with salt powder.

After half a day of steaming, the mercury will fully evaporate. When the salt is removed, the gold will naturally turn into powder.

Take one liang of this gold powder and mix it with five liang of refined cinnabar (丹砂). Choose cinnabar that is bright and translucent.

Pour vinegar over it, simmer with gentle fire, and continuously add vinegar to prevent it from running dry. Use an iron vessel—this process will take thirty-six days.

When refining is complete, grind it again with water, collect the fine particles, and mix them with date honey (枣膏) to form pills.

**Method for making date honey:**
Take three *shēng* of large, dried dates, add six *shēng* of water, and boil until the dates are thoroughly softened. Add another three *shēng* of water, boil until the mixture totals nine *shēng*, then strain out the dregs and clarify it until it reduces to three *shēng*.

Add six small bowls of refined lamb marrow (羊髓), simmer gently until it thickens like syrup—this is the date honey.

This honey can also be taken long-term, filling one’s body and enhancing beauty. Divide it into three portions, and take one portion every nine days.

Alternatively, mix this honey with the earlier medicinals, form pills the size of small beans, and take three pills daily for thirty days. This will eliminate cold and heat, allowing one to command spirits and deities.

Gold, once softened, loses its toxicity—even in small amounts, it is feared no longer.»

Silver also follows the method of softening gold. If it is inferior gold, take robust *jīng* root (荆根), boil it into a decoction, and ferment red glutinous rice into wine. Soak the gold in this wine, and it will dissolve.

If gold filings are soaked in it, and realgar (雄黄) is added to this wine, they will also dissolve. Why limit this to softening gold alone?

Another method: Take fine magnetite (磁石) that attracts iron, crush it, soak it in pure vinegar, then remove it and soak it again until it is thoroughly refined. Sift it through a fine sieve, then take the gold filings—still toxic when raw—and refine them. Place them in the palm, grind them, and they will dissolve instantly.

Drinking the elixir of this stone’s essence once, twice, or even three times—without hunger or thirst—grants longevity and eternal youth.

The scholar notes: According to the *Gold Powder and Gold Water* prescriptions, taking five *liǎng* or more ensures a lifespan equal to the heavens and earth. Yet, one must strictly abstain from conjugal relations and avoid meat. Cultivate the essence with disciplined practice—preferably in secluded mountains. This is valued by commoners, not by emperors.

How could it compare to the *Taiyi Golden Elixir* or the *Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Tripod Divine Pill*? The latter requires precise timing—when to ascend, when to pause—unhindered by family obligations or official duties.

*Conclusion of the Ninth Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Tripod Divine Pill Canon*
*Beginning of the Tenth Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine-Tripod Divine Pill Canon*

「Thus, the refined alchemy strictly regulates *yin* and *yang*, subduing and mastering the medicinal *qi*.

The scholar notes: Master Peng once said: "The sages of antiquity all relied on elixirs to preserve their bones and attain longevity. Later scholars, however, claim that elixirs rot the bones and shorten life—this is the difference between past and present. It stems from the purity and depth of ancient practice, while later generations grew decadent and superficial, failing to grasp the true methods. Though they may begin with a desire for life, they lack the perseverance to sustain it. Without first cultivating and refining the heart, how can one regulate the nature of the medicine?

Even if one follows ancient annotations and prescriptions, blending them together, the resulting concoction may resemble an elixir, yet its poison remains untouched. Taking it would lead to death—hence the saying, 'shortens life.'

The scholar further notes Master Peng’s words: 'Though one may hear of gold and cinnabar elixirs, if the fire and medicine are not first subdued and mastered, then the essence will scatter and vanish, leaving only dross. Where is the proof? Thus, one must first master the fire.'

Now, the scholar reveals the method: The divine elixir is the quintessence of superior stone medicines. For instance, when cinnabar is crushed, its radiance pierces the eyes—this is its essence. Like the Dao’s profound and mysterious depths, within it lies precision. Like its joyous and hazy brilliance, within it lies substance. It cannot be seized hastily nor sought leisurely. It seems both present and absent—haste brings no success, for its acquisition has its own method.

Compare this to milk fed to a cow: it becomes cheese, then clarified butter, and finally ghee through gradual transformation. Though it originates from milk, it is neither cheese nor clarified butter nor ghee at first. Yet one cannot say it is without these stages, nor can one say it is entirely absent. Skillful extraction yields them; clumsy attempts fail. The distinction between skill and clumsiness lies in the art of guiding the essence—urgency causes it to disperse, while haste without restraint leaves it unrefined. Once scattered, there is no way to retrieve it, unlike the essence of medicine, which can be recovered if lost. Hence, it is said: 'Only dross remains, no essence remains.' If the essence is lost, how can it be transmuted into the divine elixir?

**Method to Prevent Scattering in Alchemical Refinement**

When refining all stones, crush them like peas, or into fine grains like evening dew, or into powder like hemp seeds. Place them in a silk pouch within an iron pot, and immerse them in *jiǔ* (fermented liquor). When the liquor is infused, have someone carefully tend the fire—extinguish it immediately upon boiling, and keep the pot five inches above the heat. Ensure the fire is even, not lopsided, so that the medicinal *qi* rises straight and gently. If the fire is too fierce, the *qi* will scatter wildly; if too weak, the *qi* will stagnate. Maintain a moderate, balanced heat—like the gentle warmth of the human body—so as to adjust it properly.

Thus, the *Canon* states: 'All flying refinements must be moderate and warm, not so hot as to scald the hand. When the medicine turns white like snow, this is the nurturing method.' It is like the month of spring when the sun warms the earth: all things flourish, sprouting and growing in harmony. If one were to prolong the immersion like the *Yǔshuǐ* (Rainwater) season in a cold pool, or force excessive heat like a blazing fire in the *Qīngmíng* (Clear and Bright) season, the plants would either wither or burn. One does not straighten crooked branches by uprooting and replanting them; nor does one cleanse unclean roots by washing and reseeding them, for such actions sever the vital flow of life. Instead, the proper timing must be observed—like one who stokes the fire, then rides the heat to its peak. Those who dread cold plunge into boiling water to warm themselves both violate the natural rhythm of life and stray from the Dao of refinement and cultivation. The method is exhausted here.

The scholar has heard that Master Peng’s method involves regulating each medicine according to *yin* and *yang* principles, then combining them. Once the combination is complete, the elixir is formed—whether in large or small doses—all attain perfection. Taking it grants transcendence.

Those who seek the Great Dao and Great Elixir but fail to obtain this method will labor endlessly, waste vast wealth, and end as scattered bones.

The scholar notes: The *Yì* (Classic of Changes) says: "Two females dwelling together is called *gé* (revolution), while *yáng* and *yīn* meeting is called *tài* (great harmony). Thus, heaven and earth intermingle in *yīnyūn* (misty vapors), and all things are transformed into purity. When male and female unite in essence, all things are born anew. The unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang* is called *shén* (divine), while their balanced alternation is called the Dao.

Thus, they can mold all substances, nurturing life within the cauldron. This is the divine function of creation and the marvelous power of *yin* and *yang*. The secret essence of the divine elixir shares this principle.

*Tàiyīn* (Great *yin*) is lead, while *Tàiyáng* (Great *yáng*) is cinnabar. These two substances interact to form the greatest medicine. The Nine-Tripod method, the Dao of longevity, and the fundamental principles of refinement all center on these two substances.

Hence, the *Song of the True Person* declares the Nine-Tripod as first among all, establishing the supreme status of external alchemy:

*"Father dwells on the Divine Mountain, Mother on the River,*
*Their origin lies in South Yue, also in Ba.*
*They emerge from Wuling, meeting at Changsha,*
*With ancestors and kin in Yuzhang’s home.*
*A Daoist guides me to wander Five Hua,*
*Where Ziming pairs lead with vermilion powder.*
*Transformed, they yield countless black and yellow essences,*
*Like flowing pearls illuminating the inner chambers of the River.*
*Combined with the masculine *qi* of water and cinnabar,*
*They merge in harmony as one family.*
*Oysters and red stones keep them pure,*
*Frost and snow, violet hues, bloom like flowers.*
*When their natures resonate in balanced harmony,*
*At dusk, they stir—O’Zang, the finest.*
*Playful radiance, no fading brilliance,*
*Uniting *yin* and *yáng* without excess.*
*Two *qi* generate the child, with added sand,*
*Feathers swept, earthworm essence blended.*
*Whether a single grain or a pound—none is lacking,*
*Consumed with millet and sorghum, their essence ascends.*
*Sitting, observing heaven and earth from afar,*
*Suddenly crossing ten thousand *lǐ* to traverse rivers.*
*Riding the Dragon as horse, the Dragon as chariot,*
*Its light like the sun and moon—what more could one desire?*
*All celestial sages gather in reverence,*
*Spiritual tortoises paired in procession, turning at leisure.*
*Boya strums his zither, the Jade Maiden sings,*
*Her emerald waist sways in dance, their sorrowful harmonies blend.*
*By ingesting this elixir, the body attains perfection,*
*No malevolent *qi* arises, no illness prevails—*
*Thus, one achieves eternal youth, with no other means."*」

「This is the supreme utterance of the True Person. The *Húzǐ Gē* further states:
*"Grasses obtain yin and yang, their essence and qi remain forever verdant.
Stones obtain yin and yang, their essence and qi retain their form.
Heaven obtains yin and yang, their essence and qi perpetually generate.
Thus, all that transform the myriad things,
None fail to take yin and yang as their parents.*

The yang qi is Heaven, the yin essence is Earth.
Heaven’s qi is refined as spirit, Earth’s essence as treasure.
These two substances form the elixir—
Ingest it and attain longevity.

The five stones are:
*Dānshā* (cinnabar), the essence of the Great Intestine’s yang;
*Císhí* (magnetite), the essence of the Great Yin’s yang;
*Zēngqīng* (orpiment), the essence of the Minor Yang’s yang;
*Xiónghuáng* (realgar), the essence of the stone’s yang.
They absorb the true qi of yin and yang,
Align with the five directions’ true positions,
Mutually restraining, yet unstirred—
Refined and detoxified, thus granting immortality to those who consume them.

When refining *fúliàn* (mercury), one must use yang months, yang days, and yang hours.
If other methods are employed,
Even if the poison is not entirely exhausted,
Ask only for the three yangs—
Though minor techniques may be lost, the poison will be fully dispelled.

*Qiān gōng* (lead and mercury) are one—
The essence and qi of yin and yang.
If not refined at the three yangs,
The essence of the moon’s and sun’s yin qi
Cannot be controlled.
*Huángbái* (gold and silver) are the essence and qi of the Great Yang.
*Zuǒ wèi* (left flavor) is the morning yang’s vital fluid.
*Jīn zéi* (right flavor) is the evening yang’s sinews and marrow.
Using the three yangs’ flavors and qi
To govern lead and mercury—
It is infallible in eliminating poison.
The common folk do not understand this,
Mixing and consuming them recklessly—
It is fatal, indeed. One must be cautious.
Simply boiling them in wine
Only distances one further from the Dao.

All this pertains to the principle of yin and yang restraining each other.

**Taboos and Prohibitions in Refining Medicines**
The Classics say that when refining all medicinal stones,
One must observe strict fasting and abstinence,
Avoiding women, the six domestic animals, mourning, and childbirth.
According to my observation:
The True Person’s elixir of flight forbids fools, women, children,
Envious and deceitful individuals, and those prone to gossip.
For those who do not believe in the Dao,
Even if they witness it with their own eyes,
The divine medicine will not manifest.

Do not allow women, friends, or guests
To pass near the refining area.
Seek a secluded, quiet place—
A deep mountain cave or stone chamber—
Where no human voice or presence disturbs.
Once the divine medicine is perfected,
The entire household ascends to transcendence.

According to my observation:
The Yellow Emperor had one thousand two hundred women,
Yet even before his ascension,
At the foot of the Jing Mountains and above the Ding Lake,
He refined nine elixirs to completion,
Rode the Dragon and ascended to Heaven.
At that time, the furnace fires required human labor—
His attendants and servants—
Were they not women and close subjects?

Furthermore, in ancient times,
The Han Palace Attendant *Chéng Wěi* (程伟) was skilled in *Huángbái* (gold and silver) alchemy.
When he took a wife,
She came to know the marvels of the art.
*Wěi* would fan the charcoal to stoke the fire,
While the crucible contained *shuǐyín* (mercury).
He would press the tripod’s lid,
Yet the gold would not form.
His wife said:
*"I wish to attempt just one *liǎng* (两).
She took out her pouch’s medicine,
Added a small amount,
And in the time it takes to eat a meal,
The mercury transformed into silver."
*Wěi* was greatly startled and exclaimed:
*"The Dao is near you! Why did you not inform me sooner?"*
His wife replied:
*"Its attainment requires one with destiny."
Wěi employed every means to pressure her,
Demanding the secret method.
She said:
*"If you proclaim the Dao and align with its transmission,
Even if we meet on the road, I will pass it on.
But if you are not the right person—
One who speaks falsely while claiming sincerity—
Even if I were cut into pieces,
The method would never be revealed."*
Wěi persisted in threats,
And his wife, enraged, went mad,
Stripped naked, smeared herself with mud,
And died, her spirit ascending.

From this, it is evident:
A man who attains the Dao
Cannot succeed before a woman does.

Thus, *Xuánnǚ* (玄女), *Sùnǚ* (素女), *Qīngyāonǚ* (青腰女), and *Xīwángmǔ* (西王母)
Are all women who have ascended as immortals.

The Celestial True Person
Even employs *yùnǚ* (玉女) as attendants.

Hence, those called *yùnǚ* (玉女)
Are mortal women who, through elixir consumption,
Have attained transcendence.

Therefore, the Yellow Emperor’s *Nine Tripod Divine Elixir* states:
*"For those refining the divine elixir,
Who wish to obtain True and Pure (virtue),
With pleasing appearance and harmonious complexion,
Whose heart and body are devoted solely to the Dao,
Let them share the elixir with their master,
And sacrifice to her as the *Xuánnǚ* (玄女).*

To attain immortality,
One must share a single purpose with their master.
To transcend the world,
One must share a mutual covenant with their master."」

To seek ascension to Heaven,
One must first master the **Twenty-Four Virtues of the Sage**.

Together, they must recite the **Golden Scripture**,
Yet still the path to immortality remains unobtained.

Again, the scripture says:
*"Those refining the elixir must not exceed three in number.
Now, since the labor of distillation
Has yet not entered the **Divine Tripod**,
Therefore, the strict prohibitions are not yet enforced.*

The **breathing and condensing fire** must be regulated with precision.
If one is not of **upright heart and complete nature**,
Lacking **refined intention and keen insight**,
Speaking no idle words, acting no unworthy deeds,
Neither hasty nor sluggish,
Nor claiming false purity,
They shall not be entrusted with this task.

If one is a **condemned outcast**,
Whose six senses are impaired—
Deaf ears, blind eyes,
Or limbs crippled by pain or injury—
Though they may walk in **auspicious virtue**,
They are still unfit for this labor."

**Market Elixir Method**:
At **auspicious virtue grounds**,
Sit or stand in reverence—
Do not dispute rank with others,
Nor purchase goods from those clad in **mourning attire**.

On days of **auspicious virtue**,
Bathe on **child/rat and midnight/ox days**,
After seven days of fasting,
Then recite the **Heavenly Virtue Method**:
In the first month, **shen (申)**;
In the second month, **shen (申)** again—
To align with the **twelve celestial stems**.

For the **auspicious virtue method** of elixir purchase:
On **jia (甲) days**, virtue lies in **shen (申)**,
On **yi (乙) days**, virtue lies in **geng (庚)**,
And so forth in this manner.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Nine Tripod Divine Elixir Scripture** concludes its tenth volume,
And begins its eleventh volume.

**The Art of Refining Mercury for Longevity and Detoxification**

The method for **mercury (shuǐyín) longevity** and detoxification refinement:

The subject notes: In his later years, **Ge Hong** served as a disciple of **Zheng Yun**, while his fellow disciples all engaged in menial labor. Yet Ge Hong, weak and unable to endure hardship, could not contribute meaningfully—he only performed humble tasks like sweeping dust, holding candles, and copying old texts.

Zheng Yun said to Ge Hong: *"Reading books yields wisdom in every volume, but one must select the most refined teachings and apply them judiciously. There is no need to exhaust oneself memorizing everything, wasting time and energy. Once the **Golden Elixir (jīndān)** is perfected, these lesser tasks will no longer be needed."*

Yet the essence of the elixir lies in **mercury**. The subject notes: Among all **mercury**, the finest is the **Fuliang (涪陵) self-sufficient, unrestrained mercury** found in **Qingbai (青白) form** within the **Liu Sha (流沙)** waters. This mercury resembles tin, is exceedingly soft, and even dissolves when heated in **qi**. If such mercury cannot be obtained, refined **gold and silver** must be used instead—this is the best alternative. However, mercury derived from **cinnabar (zhūshā)** is also acceptable. **Heaven-born mercury** is now extinct.

The subject further notes: Mix **cinnabar and mercury** in equal parts—adjust quantities as needed—and refine them in an **iron vessel** or **sweet clay crucible (gān’ōu)** over charcoal. When the flame reaches **one chi five cun** in length, the mercury will emerge. Collect it in a **ling water basin (língshuǐpén)**, then gather it with paper.

The subject further notes: Place **raw bamboo tubes** filled with **cinnabar** (or **red cinnabar**) in the earth, covering the mouth with **mica (yúnmù)** to level with the ground. Leave only **three to four cun** of soil above the tube, then ignite it with **husk ash**. After **three days**, the mercury will form. If not yet complete, ignite again and wait another three days. Repeat this process until the mercury is fully refined. **One jin of cinnabar** yields **one jin of mercury**. If the mercury is insufficient—perhaps only **two or three liang**—market mercury may be impure. Such inferior mercury, though a source of longevity, must still be refined with proper elixir methods. Without self-refinement, it is inadequate.

The subject notes: According to the *Bencao* (本草), **mercury** is **spicy and cold**, toxic, and capable of treating **ulcers, scabies, and paralysis**, inducing **abortions**, repelling **lice**, and dissolving **gold, silver, copper, and tin**. It can also **reforge and transmute** back into **cinnabar**. Prolonged ingestion grants **immortality**. Another name for it is **gōng (汞)**.

The **raw cinnabar soil (生符陵平土)** emerges from cinnabar, yet fears magnetite. Now, mercury exists in both raw and refined forms. The so-called **raw cinnabar soil** is that which issues from within cinnabar’s core, or separately from cinnabar earth—both appearing **greenish-white**, most **potent**.

That which comes from **cinnabar** is obtained by burning **unrefined cinnabar powder**, yielding a **white, turbid** substance, inferior to the raw. It can **dissolve and transmute gold and silver into mud**, hence its use in **alchemical transmutation**. For **elixir work**, it is prescribed in **Daoist scriptures**. When mixed with wine and exposed to sunlight, ingestion grants **longevity**.

When burned, it ascends as **flying ash on the crucible’s rim**, named **vermilion powder (朱粉)**—commonly called **mercury ash**—most effective against **lice**.

The subject notes: **Hujangzi** states that mercury has **three origins**:
1. **Hermaphroditic mercury (雄汞)**,
2. **Feminine mercury (雌汞)**,
3. **Divine Flying Mercury (神飞汞)**.
Their uses differ, and their preparation varies. **Divine Flying Mercury** is easiest to subdue by fire, while **Hermaphroditic and Feminine Mercury** resist fire more. For **ascending to the heavens, transcending the void, and attaining longevity**, **Hermaphroditic Mercury** must be used. For **crafting elixirs, summoning spirits**, **Feminine Mercury** is required. For **transmuting copper and iron, reversing the Five Metals**, **Divine Flying Mercury** is employed. Each has its purpose—**do not mix them arbitrarily**. The uninitiated, ignorant of this, fail in their work, defying the **Sage’s prescriptions**, yielding no results. When used correctly, their effects are flawless.

This single substance is the **foundation of Daoist cultivation**; guard it carefully, for even **ten thousand gold pieces** cannot compare to its worth. Common folk understand neither its essence nor its diagrams. Even fewer grasp its intent. Moreover, this method is **jealously guarded by true immortals**, concealed and never revealed. **A hundred stone of gold, ten thousand baskets of pearls**—none would trade for this method. Yet if one **values longevity over all treasures**, and **reveres Daoist cultivation**, they must **pledge their blood in a binding oath** before its secrets may be disclosed.

---
**Method for Hermaphroditic Mercury (雄汞) Longevity Elixir**
Take **ten jin of cinnabar**, one *he* of **ghee**, and forge an **iron crucible**, round, one *chi* in diameter, half a *cun* deep, level and even, ensuring no high or low spots. Seal it tightly, then level its rim. Take **four green lotus petals**, matching the crucible’s mouth, and coat the interior with ghee. Place the **sifted cinnabar** thinly within, ensuring the ghee’s vapor permeates it. Seal with a **ceramic lid**, then caulk the rim with **sheep’s wool and thin mud**, preventing gas escape.

First, ignite **rotted grass**—let it burn for the duration of a meal. Then, kindle **softwood**—**segmented wood or willow**, free of worms and rot—**dampened repeatedly with soaked cotton** to prevent cracking from dryness.

After lighting, **do not stamp the ground or pace violently nearby**, lest the mercury descend into the flames.

From **Chen to Wu hour**, await its descent—either immediately or after a night’s rest. Retrieve it with a **broken hair sack** into a **fresh basin**, wrapping **three to four liang of fresh cotton** in **soft reed bark**, binding it tightly like a **mortar pestle**. Within the basin, crush it thoroughly, extracting all residue.

The powder is separately wrapped, formed into **Six-to-One Mud**—**most secret**.

Those refining mercury must consume **dog meat and wine**. If they abstain, the **mercury’s qi will clog the five viscera**, causing inability to eat or drink, eventually harming them. **Beware.**

From **one jin of cinnabar**, yield **twelve liang**. The **upper cinnabar** yields **ten liang**, the **lower** **eight liang**. This method is **invaluable**; **do not divulge it**.

Initially, **ten bundles of rotted grass** suffice.

---
**Method for Feminine Mercury (雌汞)**
The subject notes: To craft this mercury, mix **one *sheng* of dog fat** with **ten jin of cinnabar** into a paste, filling the crucible. For **Divine Flying Mercury**, grind **ten jin of cinnabar**, **one jin of raw sulfur**, **forty *zǐ* pods**, **one jin of rock salt**, **one jin of turmeric root**, and **one jin of *hútónglǜ* (胡同律)**, sifting each finely. Combine with **cow dung juice** into a paste, coating the crucible **one *cun* thick**. Seal tightly, ignite with kindling, and collect as before.

The **cow dung juice** must be **prepared in the twelfth month**, stored, and warmed with water before use. **Spring cow dung** is weak—its green grass impairs efficacy.

**Obscure terms clarified:**
- **"Yīnshòu xuánjīng zhī"** (阴兽玄精汁) = **cow dung juice**
- **"Shèngwúzhī"** (圣无知) = **red stone alum (赤石脑)**
- **"Qūyuánsù"** (屈原素) = **hútónglǜ (胡同律)**
- **"Hēigāosūn féi"** (黑膏孙肥) = **dog fat**

The subject’s method aligns with **imperial alchemical standards**, hence its omission from older records. All other procedures follow similarly.

「Purification of Mercury with Vinegar

Take **one jin of mercury (水银)**, wrap it in **two layers of silk (帛)**, twist and strain out the dregs, then mix with **three sheng of white salt (白盐)**. Gently knead it until the **mercury (汞)** appears a pure, settled white. Use an **iron vessel (铁器)** to heat it, allowing the **poisonous essence (姻)** to emerge—this is the **resting phase (休)**. Pour it into a **cauldron (釜)** for further processing. When the **poisonous essence (姻)** again emerges, boil it in **three years’ aged vinegar (大醋)**, three sheng at a time, with **gentle fire (微火)**. Complete a **stone’s measure (一石)**, then let it steep for **seven days (七日)** before examining its effects.

If additional substances are introduced, intending to incorporate them into **great elixirs (大丹)**, they must all undergo this same purification method. The method of mixing **vinegar with salt** to achieve verification, or using **oil, honey, and vinegar**, is as stated above.

**Selecting the Proper Time for Mercury Purification**
The subject notes: **Mercury (水银)** is toxic, and **lead (铅)**, aligned with **Too-Yin (太阴)**, cannot act alone—it must always be paired. If not subdued, the **two poisons (二毒)** cannot be fully dispelled. Thus, one must choose **times of Triple-Yang (三阳)**, using **Triple-Yang medicines (三阳之药)**, to subdue **lead and mercury (铅汞)**. This ensures their complete elimination without fail.

Commoners, failing to comprehend, act recklessly—merely mixing them without proper method will kill those who consume it. Simply boiling with **vinegar alone (醋)** is too distant from the **Dao (道)**. Hence, **Triple-Yang times (三阳时)**—specifically **odd-numbered days and odd hours (奇日奇时)**—are most emphasized, particularly **the Fifth Day of the Fifth Month (五月五日)** and **the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month (七月七日)**, as the **Way (道)** holds.

**Triple-Yang Medicines (三阳药)** refer to the **refined essence of the Great Yang (太阳之精气)**, which are **yellow and white (黄白)**. The **morning dew of the sun (朝阳之津液)** is **Left-Flavor (左味)**. The **evening sinews and marrow of the sun (夕阳之筋髓)** are **Golden Thief (金贼)**.

If the **medicinal properties (药味)** are mismatched or the **timing is incorrect (时节)**, even with ten thousand methods of treatment and refining, the **poison will remain (毒不尽)**. Thus, the **Subdued Mercury by Fire (伏火水银)** method states: Use **three years’ aged vinegar (大醋)**, add **fine, aged yellow sand (秾沙)**, and boil it for **one hundred days (百日)**.

Another method says: Use **yellow aged sand (黄秾沙)**, which is **flowing yellow (流黄)**; or **white aged sand (白秾砂)**, with the **two substances equally divided (二物等分)**, and boil the **mercury (汞)** in the **vinegar (醋)**. Observe and test it after **three sets of seven days (三七日)** to discern the **strength or weakness (力强弱)** of the process.

Another method says: Mix **vinegar with salt**, add a **small amount of saltpeter (硝石)**, and boil the **mercury (汞)**. Further, add a **touch of cinnabar powder (胡粉)**, and the **mercury will become white like silver snow (汞即白如银雪)**, suitable for casting into pills.

To incorporate it into **various great elixirs (诸大丹)**, grind the **medicinal residues (药屑)** into powder and add them **after refining (入飞)**.

Another method says: Place the **purified mercury (上汞)** into an **iron vessel (铁器)**, pour over **aged, bitter wine (淳苦酒)**, and boil with **gentle fire (微火)**. As the **bitter wine evaporates (苦酒消)**, replenish it continuously, ensuring it never runs dry. After **thirty-six days (三十六日)**, the **mercury will congeal and dry (汞凝乾)**, making it usable. Without this, the process is merely self-torture.

Another method says: **All refining processes (一切调炼)** must maintain **constant, moderate heat (恒令媪热)**, never so intense that it **scalds the hands (汤人手)**. The **mercury will then appear white like snow (药即白雪)**. Though these methods omit mention of **yellow, white, and Left-Flavor (黄白左味)**, their **principles of nurturing and timing (将养节候)** are still worthy of adoption, hence they are not discarded.

The **authentic method (正诀)** follows below.

**Subduing Mercury with Fox’s Just Child (狐刚子伏水银)**
Take **two jin of mercury (水银)**, in the form of **dark pearls (玄珠)**. Mix with **gold flakes (金屑)** and **silver flakes (银屑)**, along with **vinegar (醋)**, to produce **yellow and white (黄白左味)**. Boil for **thirty days and nights (三十日，三十夜)**, carefully monitoring so the **liquid never runs dry (勿使汁尽)**. The **mercury will then congeal white like snow (凝白如雪)**.

If one intends to make **elixirs (丹)**, follow the **three sets of thirty-six stone’s measures (三十六石)** of **water (水)** for boiling and refining. If the **poison remains (毒未尽)**, remove it, then place the **mercury into the cauldron (入釜)** and immediately form the **elixir (丹)**. If it does not congeal, boil further until it **congeals white like snow (凝白如雪)** as the limit.

The **methods for crafting divine elixirs (所造神丹节｀度)** follow their respective **seventy-two elixir methods (七十二丹诀)**.

**Method of Refining with Gold Dark Pearls (金玄珠法)**
Take **one jin of dark pearls (玄珠)**, with **two and a half liang of gold (金二两半)**, undergoing **fifty refines (五十炼)**. Use **five liang and two and a half fen of lead essence (铅精五两半)**.

Place the **gold flakes (金屑)** into the **cauldron (铛)** at once, and boil them in **yellow and white (黄白左味)**. After **fifteen days and nights (十五日，十五夜)**, carefully monitor so the **liquid never runs dry (无令汁尽)**. The **mercury will congeal white like silver (凝白如银)**.

If the **poison remains (毒未尽)** and one wishes to incorporate it into **elixirs (诸丹)**, boil it again in **three sets of thirty-six stone’s measures (三十六石)** of **water (水)**, refining, removing the **poison (去毒)**, and adding it **after refining (入飞)**. If it can be mixed with **gold powder (金粉)**, then the **pills and ointments (散丸膏)** are made from **dried yellow mercury (黄乾伏)**.

**Method of Refining with Silver Dark Pearls (银玄珠法)**
Take **one jin of dark pearls (玄珠)**, with **one liang and two and a half fen of silver (银一两半)**, undergoing **fifty refines (五十炼)**. Use **six liang and two and a half fen of lead essence (铅精六两半)**.

Place the **silver flakes (银屑)** into the **cauldron (铛)** at once, and boil them in **yellow and white (黄白左味)**. After **nine days and nights (九日九夜)**, carefully monitor as before, ensuring the **outer impurities are fully removed (表裹彻净)**. The **mercury will congeal white and luminous (凝白光明)**.

If one wishes to make it **pure white (作白)**, boil it in **water of the Sunstone (誉石水)** for **half a day (半日)**, then in **water of the White Alum (白矾石水)** for another **half day (半日)**. Dry it, then subdue it to make **white mercury (伏作白)**—this will succeed.

To incorporate it into **various powders (诸粉)**, remove the **poison (去毒)** first, then add it **after refining (入飞)**.

**Method of Refining with Nine-Elixir Lead Essence and Dark Pearls (九丹铅精玄珠法)**
Take **two jin of dark pearls (玄珠)**, with **twelve liang of lead essence from Nine-Elixir (九丹铅精十二两)**. Boil in **yellow and white (黄白左味)** for **seven days and nights (七日七夜)**. The **mercury will congeal white and fully purified (凝白彻净)**, then dry and subdue it to remove the **poison (去毒)**.

Combine with **all other medicines (合诸药)**, and it will become **River Chariot (河车)**.

With **the eight kinds of methods (八种)**, **elixir and lead (丹铅)** can be refined from **one to nine (从一至九)**, selecting as needed. When layered upon **various elixirs (覆籍诸丹)**, none will fail to form. Transformations are possible at will—incorporating **copper or iron (铜铁)** as desired.

**The seventy-two divine alchemical methods (七十二丹神器)** all use this process, adjusting **depth and quantity (深浅)** according to the **seasonal transformations (华应)**.

**Authentic Method for Subduing Mercury with Mulberry Ash (煮伏水银诀)**
Take **four liang of mercury (水银)**, with **one liang of silver (银一两)**, forming a **mercury-silver paste (银汞泥饼)**. Place it in an **iron container (铁函)** with **mulberry ash (桑灰)**, which must be **finely sifted and white (细筛白诤)**.

The subject notes: The **above methods (上件诸法)** all use **fewer days (日数)**. People often follow them, but if verification fails, they abandon the process. This occurs due to **excessive vinegar and intense fire (醋多火急)**, **liquid depletion and mercury drying (汁尽汞乾)**, **mismatched medicinal properties (药味差违)**, or **improper seasonal transformations (华池失法)**.

Now, the **cauldron (铛)** should be **five fen thick (五分)**, ground smooth and even. Do not place **any base layer (元布案)** inside the **cauldron (铛)**. The **mulberry ash (桑灰)** should be **seven fen thick (七分)**. Mix it thoroughly with **vinegar (醋)**, ensuring **even saturation (浥浥)** and no **uneven distribution (无置高下)**. Spread it **four times evenly (四布平停)**.

Do not press it firmly, lest it **crack or split (拆莹)**. Ensure **uniform diffusion of qi (气均赓)** and **steam permeation (熏润)** to subdue the **mercury (水银)**.»

「Make a wooden stake, using silk as its base. On the silk, spread **water silver** and the other medicines evenly—namely **stone-flow yellow (石流)**, white arsenic (黄白), **arsenic sulfide (确砂)**, rock salt (石盐), **lodestone (磁石)**, **bitter salt (卤咸)**, and **barite powder (胡粉)**—each weighing one *liang* (两). Mix with six *liang* of **mulberry ash (桑灰)**, sift through a fine sieve, and apply it uniformly over the **water silver**, making it two *fen* (分) thick. Saturate it with **vinegar (醋)**, ensuring it remains **consistently moist like porridge (恒使如粥)**, neither too dry nor overly excessive, and always keep its **qi balanced and upright (气调直)**—if it bubbles violently, that is **excessive fire (火急)**.

Replace the **ash and medicine** in the **cauldron (铛)** daily. Use **special paper (盖)**, which strictly avoids dust and impurities; the added ingredients must not be **tossed in carelessly (例不玲投)**. Retain the mixture as per the above method, until it reaches **one hundred days**, when the **water silver** will be fully transformed.

Once the cooking is complete, crush and dry it for **oral ingestion**. The method for **dry ingestion of *xuanzhu* (玄珠)** follows:

Use an **iron pot (熟铁锅)** weighing eight *jin* (斤), initially forged into two halves, each weighing four *jin*. At the center of each half, carve a hole the size of a **chicken egg (鸡子)**, wrapping the edges four times with a strip of metal, then weld them shut, making the pot **half a *cun* (寸) thick** overall. On the **greenish-black surface (车窠展绿)**, drill a hole as thick as an **arrow shaft (箭竿)**. At the hole’s edges, make the metal **thicker for secure fastening (务欲钉牢)**. Pour the **mercury (水银)** into the pot and seal it with a weld; verify its **tightness by tapping (勘可旁量)**, ensuring absolute **leak-proof integrity (必须牢密)**.

Pound the **medicines into fine powder (细药)**, then apply **four layers of sweet clay (甘泥)**, each coating **half a *cun* thick**. Leave it exposed for **five to six days**, until thoroughly dry. Then place it in a **charcoal fire (炭火)**, arranging the **ash bags (排囊)** and gradually blowing until the pot glows red, lasting **one meal’s time (一食时)**. After removing the **ash bags**, let the fire extinguish naturally; wait through the night until the next morning. From **Chen (辰)** to **Si (巳)**, adjust the heat as needed. When the pot emits a **shaking sound like broken tiles (去土摇铁如瓦砾声)**, weigh it again—its weight should remain **unchanged (秤铁复本是不耗)**. If the sound is lost, the weight has been **consumed (即本耗)**.

When the process is complete, **chisel open the pot** to remove the **water silver**. Dry and store it properly, then **refine its toxicity (诀须去毒)**.

To **remove *xuanzhu*’s toxicity (去玄珠毒)**:
First, prepare **yellow alum (黄矾) water**—one *dou* (斗). Place it in a **copper cauldron (铜铛)** and cook the **water silver** within, using **five *jin* above and two *jin* below** (上可五斤，下可二斤), until the **alum water is fully consumed (令矾石水尽)**.

Next, **burn cow dung** without leaving any ash, then **grind lodestone into small beans (磁石破如小豆)**. Boil the **dung ash** until it reaches a **rolling boil (极沸)**, and use this **hot decoction to wash the *xuanzhu* powder twice (淋二灰)**. Collect the **liquid residue (取汁)** in the **cauldron**, then cook the **water silver** for **one day and night (煮玄珠一日夜)**. Afterward, use **three cycles of refined *huangbai* (黄白) medicines** (黄白左味) to **recook it for another day and night (更煮经一宿一日)**.

Upon completion, add **three cycles of fine wine (好酒)** and **honey (蜜)**, cooking again for **one day and night (更煮经一宿一日)**. Finally, take **pure ghee (真酥)** and cook it for **three nights (更煮之三夜)**. Remove the **water silver**, place it in a **copper vessel (铜器)**, and cover it tightly. Bury it in **millet (黍米)** and **steam it for three days and nights (蒸之三日三夜)**—this will **fully eliminate its toxicity (出其毒皆尽)**, allowing it to be **incorporated into any medicine (可以入万药)** or used for **immortal elixirs (服饵神仙)**. When **yellow and white arsenic sublimate into smoke upon heating (作黄白入火飞)**, this marks the **ultimate attainment of the Dao/Way (此是道之至极毕矣)**.

The phrase **"three cycles of fine wine (三转好酒)"** refers to **dogwood wine (牡荆酒)**. The term **"three cycles of *huangbai* (黄白左味)"** means **three cycles of the *huangbai* medicines (黄白左味)**. When cooking **water silver** with **alum water**, both the **vessel and the mercury** must be **refined (镕)**. If the **water silver** does not **dissolve (消)**, you may instead make it into **cauldron cakes (铛饼子)**. If it cannot be crushed, **sift it finely and cook it**, or apply the **steaming method** as well. A **five-*jin* cauldron (五斤铛)** can hold **two *dou* of finely processed *xuanzhu* (二斗细理者)**—all **water silver** detoxification methods converge here, with no other variations.

Only the **Taixuan Master’s formula (太玄君诀)** states: **"Do not ask if it is dry; just ingest *xuanzhu* (玄珠)."** If you ingest *xuanzhu* **while moist**, seeking to **remove its toxicity**, even **one *liang* of sweet yellow (甜黄)**—a type of **yellow earth (一名玄黄土)**, sourced from the **Western barbarian lands (西方胡国)**—will prevent the **water silver’s essence from dispersing (玄珠精不能散去)**. Even **lodestone fears it (磁石亦以为畏)**, and **Mieduo Seng (蜜陀僧)** serves as its **commander (臣将)**. If you use **yellow cinnabar (黄丹)** or **barite powder (胡粉)** to **restrain the water silver’s essence**, it is merely **common practice (俗间杂用)**, not the **authentic formula (正本诀)**. Similarly, using **yellow arsenic sulfide (黄秾沙)** or **rock salt (石盐)** is also **not the orthodox method (非正本口诀)**.

The **alternative method for moistening and subduing *xuanzhu* (湿伏玄珠法)** uses **hooked lead (以钩铅)**:

First, take a **well-refined iron cauldron (好细理铁铛)**, capable of holding **three to two *sheng* (升)**. Shape it like the **"turtle method (鳌法)"**, leaving a **long opening (长开口)**. When the **mercury is first sealed (及突融先伏)** and you wish to **combine the medicines (及欲合药)**, it becomes the **"River Cart (河车)"**.

Form the **water silver into cakes (玄珠作饼)**, place them in the **cauldron**, and cover them with **lead powder (银粉为覆藉)**—or, if **lead powder is unavailable**, use **cinnabar lead powder (丹铅粉)** instead. The method is detailed in the **ninth *Si* (巳) section**.

Add **five *sheng* of oil (油脂)** and **one *sheng* of honey (蜜)**, then **mix and cook the *xuanzhu* cakes**. Some say the process lasts **thirty days and nights (三十日夜止)**, while others claim **three days and nights suffice (三日夜罢)**. The **earlier method for detoxifying copper and iron (前去毒煮法)** requires **one day and night (用一日夜)**. This **moistening and subduing method (湿伏法)** now employs **oil (油脂)**.

The **method for producing *longsheng* water silver (出长生水银)** uses **one *ge* (合) of ghee (酥)** to **coat the cauldron (涂釜)**, then **boils the water silver** while **covering with a clay-honey mixture (堵脂和朱为泥)**. In the **earlier detoxification method**, **wine and honey (酒和蜜)** are used, whereas in this **moistening and subduing method**, **oil and honey (油脂和蜜)** are applied—this is the **distinction (别矣)**.

This is called the **"moistening and subduing technique (湿伏之功)"**, differing from the **"River Cart method for copper and iron (立变铜铁也)"**.」

「Thus, the **mercury refined by the moistening and subduing method (湿伏之汞)**—when combined with **remaining subdued fire elixir (余伏火药)**—can produce **the elixir’s true formula (丹方)**. If one instead **refines the *xuánzhū* (玄珠) with herbs (药)**, stirring and mixing them until completion, that is **the River Cart method (河车之法)**, not the **genuine subdued *xuánzhū* (真伏玄珠)**.

The **Scribe notes (臣按)**: To **forge *huánghuā* (玄黄) from mercury** or to **attempt the Great Elixir (大丹)**, one must first **distill it in an empty cauldron (空煮取拟)**. If not distilled, **mercury can be paired with *jiǔdān* lead (九丹铅精)**, but **it must be refined with fifty-fold smelted lead (五十炼铅精)** and **gold and silver (金银)** to **bind and retain (拘留)** it properly.

**End of the *Eleventh Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之十一)**.
**Twelfth Scroll of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀卷之十二)** begins with the **method for combining *jiǔdān* lead (合九丹铅法)** and the **powers of refined lead (铅力功能)**.

The **Scribe notes (臣按)**: **Hú Gāngzǐ (狐刚子)** says: *"In combining elixir ingredients (合丹药), lead (铅) is the foundation. If the lead is not genuine (不真), the elixir will never succeed (药无成者)."* Thus it is said: *"Lead (铅), the sinew and marrow of **yin-yang (阴阳)**, the finest medium of **the Seven Treasures (七宝)**—when **unblocked (解)**, all undertakings can be achieved; when **obstructed (迷)**, even a thousand paths are sealed. Hence the saying: **‘Lead surpasses the River Cart, empty (铅绝河车空)’,**—what is made will **never succeed (必无功)**. **‘The power ends with the River Cart, empty (功断河车绝)’,**—all calculations will yield nothing (万计无所出)."* It is further said: *"Do not **break my Cart (莫破我车)**, nor **ruin my return home (废我还家)**. Do not **corrupt my lead (莫坏我铅)**, or **my life will be preserved (我命得全)**."*

The **Cart (车)** refers to the **River Cart (河车)**. Among **the eight River Cart methods (八河车法)**, none can succeed without relying on lead (铅). The **covering and nurturing elixir (丹之覆荐之药)** is what is called the **River Cart (河车)**. Hence it is said: *"Without the eight kinds of River Cart, the elixir has no foundation or refinement (丹无依伏是也)."*

The **Scribe further notes (又按)**: **Lead (太阴)** is the **lead (铅)**, while **the elixir (太阳)** is the **elixir (丹)**. When these two are combined into a medicine (成药), those who take it become **divine immortals (神仙)**. The **refined essence of elixir and lead (丹铅之精)** can **emit flowing pearls of white snow (出流珠白雪)**. When **two waters (二水)** are added and **all is distilled a hundred times (凡百蒸之)**, taking **one *jīn* (斤)** and dividing it into **nine portions (九分)**, repeatedly **transforming and refining (转变不已)**, it becomes **the elixir of the Divine (化神丹)**. Its **powers are profound (功既探)**, and its **efficacy is vast (力亦大)**. Through **nine ascensions and nine descensions (九上九下)**, covering and nurturing **mercury (水银)**, and **transforming mercury into elixir (化汞为丹)** in **three cycles of nine refineries (三作九转)**, it is why **the Sage keeps it secret (故圣人秘之)**, unknown to **ordinary Daoists (凡俗道士)**.

Lead’s refined essence has **thirty-six secret names (秘目)**, listed as follows:

The **Scribe notes (臣按)**: All **these thirty-six wondrous medicines (三十六名妙药)** are achieved through the **power of refined lead (铅精之力)**. Therefore, the **first method of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir (黄帝九鼎神丹第一之法)** is called **Elixir Flower (丹华)**. Another name is **Flowing Pearl Nine Refineries (流珠九转)**, which is made by **combining lead with mercury (以铅合汞)**.

Ordinary people **do not know (凡俗不知)**, and thus **they use tin from the market (市锡) as lead (为铅)****. This is like seeking progress by retracing one’s steps at dusk—how difficult it is! (可谓日暮途远，却行求进，不亦难矣.)** The methods for making it now must be **precise and specialized (皆须精专)**, completing **nine transformations (转至九方)**.

**Hú Gāngzǐ’s Method for Nine-Refinery Lead-Elixir (狐刚子作九转铅丹法)**
Take **ten *jīn* (斤) of lead (铅十斤)**, smelt it in an **iron cup (铁杯)** until it becomes **green sand (作青沙)**, then pound it in an **iron basin (铁盆)** with an **iron hammer (铁锤)** until it emits **yellow juice (取黄汁)**. Spread this **juice on fresh tiles (新瓦上暴)**, collect the **yellow powder (黄粉)**, and mix it with **the essence of *xuánzhū* (玄精汁)** to form **a pellet like a rooster’s egg (为团如鸡子)**. Let it dry in the **yin (阴)**, then smelt it in a **revolving furnace (缭炉)** to extract **the refined essence of lead (铅精)**. Return this essence to the **iron cup (铁杯)** and smelt it with **fierce fire (猛火)**. After **one cycle of refinement (一伏时)**, it becomes **lead-elixir (铅丹)**. Repeat this **nine times (如此九转)** to achieve **Nine-Refinery Lead (名曰九转铅)**.

The **sequence of transformations and medicines (转数用药次第)** is detailed in **the Yellow Old Master’s Nine Ascending Elixirs Canon (黄老九飞丹节度中)**.

**Method for *Jiǔdān* Lead and *Xuánzhū* (九丹铅玄珠法)**
Take **three *jīn* (斤) of *xuánzhū* (玄珠)** and **twelve *liǎng* (两) of *jiǔdān* lead essence (九丹铅精)**, and **distill them together in the *Huángbái Zuǒwèi* (黄白左味)** for **seven days and nights (七日夜)**. When the **white congeals and the black disperses (凝白彻挣)**, dry it, **subdue its toxicity (伏去毒)**, and combine it with **other medicines (合诸药)**—thus **the River Cart is formed (即成河车)**.

Among **the eight River Carts (八河之车)**, **lead-elixir ranges from the first to the ninth (丹铅从一至九)**—one may **select as needed (任取其用)**—to **cover and nurture all elixirs (藉覆诸丹)**, and **none will fail (无有不成者)**. It can **freely transform when mixed with copper or iron (随意入铜铁，变化自在)****. All **seventy-two divine elixir instruments (七十二丹神器)** are made using this method, each **according to the refinement of the medicines (各随药转)** and **adjusting depth and efficacy (深浅任量)**.

Though this method is already described in **the *Xuánzhū* Scroll (玄珠卷中)**, the **principles of using lead (用铅之道)** are **reiterated and emphasized (虽重发扬)**. Upon reviewing this text, one understands that **the lead used in the River Cart must be distilled in *Huángbái Zuǒwèi* (黄白左味)**, congealed, dried, and detoxified (煮凝，乾伏并备)**, only then can it be applied.

It is further said: *"Lead-elixir ranges from the first to the ninth—select as needed (丹铅从一至九，任取)."* Common people **do not know (俗人不知)**, and thus **they read *rèn* (任) with a falling tone (去声)**, but **it should be read with a level tone (平声)**, meaning *"capable of (堪也)"*. **The lead must undergo nine refineries (其铅非至九转)** before it is **capable of being used (不堪取也)**.

「Thus it is said: *"The lead-elixir, from the first to the ninth—once refined, it is capable of being used (任取矣)."* When **nine-refined lead-elixir (九转丹铅)** is used for the **River Cart (河车)**, or when applied to **cover and nurture (覆藉)** other elixirs, **there is none that fails (无有不成)**. The **seventy-two elixirs of the divine instruments (七十二丹神器)** all rely on this for their creation, each **adapting to the medicine’s potency (各随药转)**.

**Only nine-refined lead-elixir (非九转丹铅)** is **capable of being used (不堪作玄黄也)** as **Xuanhuang (玄黄)**—the **alchemical essence of lead and sulfur (铅黄花)**. It is further said: *"Though one may freely combine it with copper or iron (随意入铜铁), its transformations are unrestrained (变化自在),"* yet **the method of testing and refining (试药点黄白之道)** is **not achieved (亦非此九转丹铅成者)** unless **this nine-refined lead-elixir (此)** is **properly used (不任用也)**.

**The Method of Extracting Long-Life Lead (出长生铅法)**
I observe: **Though the Dao of lead-elixir (丹铅之道)** is **universally nine-refined (法皆九转)**, its applications **differ in three ways (按其用处，三种不同)**. If one seeks **long life, eternal vision, and transcendence (长生久视，羽化升天)**, **one must forge *xióng* lead (雄铅)**. If one seeks **to summon ghosts and spirits, or to transmute into liquid like water (辟召鬼神，化液作水)**, **one must use *cí* lead (雌铅)**. If one seeks **to transform yellow and white, or to transmute the five metals (变化黄白，回换五金)**, **one must use *shénfēi* lead (神飞铅)**.

Common people **mistake the first refinement (一) as mere crude mixture (混而无二)**, and thus **their applications are disordered (用之错乱)**, their creations **fail (所作不成)**, and they **blame the sages for ineffectual prescriptions (遂怨咎圣人方书无效)**. But **if refined and used correctly (若审而用之)**, **there is no failure (万不失一)**. This method **is unknown to the vulgar (此法俗无有解者)**, and **only those who have seen the *Five-Powder Diagram* (五粉图)** can **barely grasp its minimal proportions (乃能略知少配)**. Hence, **true persons (真人)** keep it **as a guarded secret (宝秘而不传)**.

**This single medicine (此之一药)** is **the foundation of Daoist arts (道术之本)**—**guard it carefully (慎勿轻传)**, for **its worth is beyond gold (万金不泄)**. Even if **one possessed a hundred stones of yellow gold and ten thousand baskets of pearls (假使黄金百石，明珠万筐)**, **one would still not reveal it (亦不传也)**. **If one obtained this method (若得此法)**, **all treasures would be seen as mere soil (七宝视之如土)**—**why need one hoard gold and pearls (何用百石万筐乎)**? Only **those who treasure long life (宝骯长生), cherish the Dao of transcendence (爱慕仙道), and swear solemn oaths (敌血分环，重立信誓)** may **be granted its minimal proportions (乃可略而出之)**.

**This pertains also to the methods of mercury (此言并是汞方之所具载)**. Yet **three leads and three mercuries are but one (然以三铅三汞，一而已矣)**. Hence the prescription states: *"Their functions differ, yet they share no distinction with mercury (功用别能，与汞无异)**."* **Mercury and lead (汞之与铅)** **cannot act alone (终不独行)**—**they must always pair (行必为偶)**. **If refined and used correctly (审而用之)**, **there is no failure (万不失一)**. Common people **often mistake tin for lead (俗人多以锡为铅)**, **far from the Dao (去道远矣)**.

It is further said: **The *xióng*, *cí*, and *shénfēi* leads (雄雌神飞三种)** each **require three refineries (各须三转)** before **their prescriptions take effect (用方有效)**. The **method of refining (转之法)** is **no different from what was stated earlier (用，不异於前)**—**lead, when refined to nine stages (铅至九转)**, becomes **a divine medicine (体为神药)**. **When combined with other medicines (用入余药)**, **none fail (无不效矣)**. Hence, **those who have seen the *Five-Powder Diagram* (惟见粉图者)** know **its profound intent (知少意深)**. **All other sages and immortals (自余仙圣)** keep **this prescription hidden (皆秘此方)**. Thus, **today’s creations (故今所作)** are **often flawed, rarely successful (多败少成矣)**.

**The Method of Extracting *Xióng* and *Cí* Leads (出雄雌铅法)**
Take **a hundred pounds of true elixir (真丹百斤)** and **ten pounds of *Qīngbái Yángqǐ* stone (青白阳起石)**. Further, **grind the *Táo Yángqǐ* stone (梼阳起石)** and **sift it finely (细筛之)**. **Mix it with *Xuanjing* juice (玄精汁)** to form **clusters (作团)**, and **expose them to dry (暴之令燥)**.

**Place them in an iron pot (纳铁锅中)** and **heat with a furnace (以炉鼓之)** until **the juice is fully consumed (待为汁消尽)**. **Pour it into warm ashes (泻於暖灰中)** and **wait for the clusters to be selected (待玲打择)**. **Take them as *Danfù* lead (取之为丹覆)**—**the finest (最佳)**. **The term *Danfù* (丹覆)** refers to **medicines for the alchemical essence of lead and sulfur (入神丹玄黄之药也)**.

**The Method of Extracting *Cí* Lead (出雌铅法)**
Take **a hundred pounds of true elixir (真丹百斤)** and **fifteen pounds of true powder (真粉)**. **Take one pound of *Hào Qīngfān* (昊青矾)** and **one pound of lime (石灰)**—**each ground separately (各别梼)**. **Sift the *fān* and stone finely (其矾石细筛)**. **Combine these four substances (四物合和)** and **roll them into pills with *Xuanjing* juice (以玄精汁丸之)**. **Dry them in the shade (阴乾出之)**—**the method is identical to that previously described (法与前不异也)**.

**The Method of Extracting *Shénfēi* Lead (出神飞铅法)**
Take **a hundred pounds of true elixir (真丹百斤)**, **five pounds of *Hào Huángfān* (昊黄矾)**, **one pound of red rock salt (赤石盐)**, **two pounds of *Yùjīn* root (郁金根)**, and **five ounces of yellow sulfur (黄炮砂)**. **Grind these five substances separately (此五味异梼下筛)** and **mix them with wine and elixir (以酒合丹搜之)**—**do not let them adhere (勿令相着)**. **Expose them to dry (暴之令燥)** and **regrind and sift them (更梼筛之)**. Then **take *Xuanjing* juice (牛粪汁)** and **soak them to form clusters (没之为团)**. **Dry them in the shade (阴乾之)**—**the method is as before (出法一如前诀者)**.

**The prescription calls *red rock salt* (赤石盐) *"the Sage’s Unknown"* (圣无知者)**. **The term *Xuanjing juice* (玄精汁) refers to *cow dung juice* (牛粪汁)**. **The term *Huángshān zhī* (黄山脂) refers to *Hào fān* (昊矾)**. **The term *Huángjīn zéi* (黄金贼) refers to *stone sulfur* (石硫黄)**. **In general, when combining medicines with elixir (凡以药和丹一法)**, the **order is: first *Huángfān* (黄矾), then *Chì Líng* (赤灵)**, then *Yùjīn* root (郁金根), then *stone sulfur* (石硫黄), and finally *Huángdān* (黄丹)**. **After this, moisten them with fine wine (讫，方以好酒润和之)**—**do not let them cling (勿使相着)**. **For every fifty pounds of *Huángdān* (黄丹)**, **use five *dàshēng* (大升) of clear wine (可用清酒五大升)**. **Spread them on a high rack with reed mats (於高架苇箔)**, **cover with thick paper (上铺厚纸)**, **seal with fish scales (糊鱼鳞)**, and **press in two layers (相压两重)**. **Expose them for about one day (暴可一日许)**. Then **soak them in cow dung juice to form clusters (然用牛粪汁没之为团)** and **dry them in the shade for ten days (於架箔上阴乾十日)**.

**Another method (又法)**: **First weigh the elixir (先秤丹知斤两)** and **the medicines separately (又别秤药知斤两)**. **Then match their proportions (即以药对丹)**—**adjusting for excess or deficiency (多少相配)**. **Sift them through a fine sieve (以赢罗筛)**. **Layer them alternately—one layer of elixir (布一重丹)**, one layer of medicine (一重药)**—**until all are exhausted (重重相次并尽)**. Then **mix them with wine (然后以酒搜之)**.

**The First Refining of Lead (鼓出铅诀第一转)**
Take **the medicines used (以所用味之药)**—**each ground separately and sifted finely (各异梼下筛)**—**and mix them with wine as previously described (以酒如上法合没)**—**do not let them adhere (勿令相着)**. **Spread them to dry (摊暴令乾)** and **regrind them, sift them finely (更梼下筛)**. **Combine them with cow dung juice to form clusters (以牛粪汁和搜为团)**. **The cow dung should be collected and stored in the twelfth month (其牛粪以腊月收贮)** and **steeped in boiled water (以燸水浸独)**. **Take the juice to form clusters like the yolk of an egg (取之团如鸡子黄)**—**if larger, they are harder to dry (若更大者难乾)**. **Dry them in the shade for two weeks (二七日阴乾之)** and **place them in an iron pot (纳铁锅中)**. **The pot’s base is seven inches long (长七寸)**—**its thickness varies: six and a half *fēn* (分) at the bottom (底厚六分半)**, five *fēn* in the middle (以下五分)**, and four *fēn* at the top (以上四分)**—**its width is three and a half inches (明问三寸半)**. **Heat them with a furnace (排炉出看)** until **the juice is fully consumed (尽消为汁)**. **Then pour them into warm, fine white ashes (方泻着暖灰中)**—**sifted and spread evenly on a clean surface (其灰唯细筛白者)**—**three to four *fēn* thick (厚三四分)**. **Roll the edges with dry clay (四畔以乾泥卷绕灰)** to **prevent the lead juice from spreading (不使铅汁流溢四散)**. **Press the clusters with your hands (以手摸铅)** and **wait for their selection (待玲打择)**. **The wine used should be one *dǒu* (斗) per hundred pounds (率百斤)**—**or **two *dǒu* if using *Xuanjing* juice (若玄精汁，二斗即可)**—**to yield **a hundred pounds of refined lead (团得百斤丹)**.

**The Second Refining of Lead (鼓出铅诀第二转)**
Take **the refined lead from the previous stage (上件铅)** and **roast it in an iron bowl (於铁杯中炒之)**. **The bowl’s base is three feet long (长三尺)**, **one inch thick (厚一寸)**, and **one foot deep (深一尺)**—**with slightly flared edges (两头得稍绰)**.

So **the length is three feet and five inches (上长三尺五寸)**, **the width one foot and two inches (阔一尺二寸)**, **shaped like a trough (如槽之形也)**.

**Rub and wrap it until it is extremely smooth and pure (摩裹令滑极净)**, **lest it crackle or emit a bright glow (勿使嘶莹)**.

**Stir it with a long, blunt sword and an iron rake (以长钝剑铁篦搅之)**, **roasting until all the sand is exhausted (炒令并作沙尽)**, **from dawn till noon (从旦至午)**. **When it becomes fine powder (看成细末)**, **continuously scrape it out (续续掠出)** and **place it in a cold vessel (置冷器中)**—**a thick iron basin or pan (其器是厚铁盆擭也)**.

**Add clear water (着清水)**, **stirring with a long iron rake (以长铁篦搅之)**. **Have two or three people take turns stirring (使两三人更互搅)**, **without pausing (勿令住手)**, **until it forms a juice (使成汁也)**.

**Similarly, when roasting lead in the iron bowl (然於铁杯中炒铅)**, **you may also alternate helpers (亦得换人)**, **but must not pause (不得住手)**.

**If there is any interruption (若有问断)**, **the sand must be remelted again (其沙复镕)**. **Place the iron bowl over a charcoal fire (铁杯之下然以柴火)**, **for if the fire is too weak (火玲不得)**, **the sand will not melt completely (沙成)**, **and if the fire is too fierce (大热)**, **it may melt uncontrollably (恐镕不止)**. **Observe the fire carefully at the moment of operation (临事看火)**, **neither too slow nor too rapid (勿令缓急也)**.

**Collect the yellow juice from the crucible (接取坩徒黄汁)**, **place it in a porcelain container (置瓷子中)**—**pierce holes in the bottom with a water drill (着水钻腹作孔)**—**wait until the juice settles and clarifies (候徒澄清)**. **Pour out the water through the holes (倾孔去水)**, **and evenly extract the clarified juice with a smooth iron rake (以滑铁篦匀率出澄徒)****, placing it on fresh tiles (置新瓦上)**.

**Previously, lay two layers of paper on the tiles (预於瓦上铺两重纸)**. **Spread the tiles evenly in the sun (以瓦凡平布烈日之中)** and **expose them for one day (暴之一日)**. **The lead will then harden and crack on the tiles (丹在瓦上硬裂乾定)**. **Collect it with a fine sieve (收取梼筛)** and **put it back into the iron bowl (纳铁杯中)**.

**Stir and roast it again with the iron rake (还以铁篦搅炒令赤)** until it turns **red (赤)**, **over three days and nights (三日夜)**. **Do not use intense fire (不得猛火)**; **once the lead is red, it is complete (丹赤即成)**—**the days are not strictly counted (不拘日数也)**.

**The Third Refining of Lead (鼓出铅诀第三转)**
**For all cases of using wine to extract medicine (凡以酒搜药)**, **or using *Xuanjing* juice to mix with the lead (及以玄精汁拌丹)**, **it must be done in a straight-mouthed, deep copper basin (皆於直口深铜盆中)**. **The basin must be smooth and pure (盆须滑净)**; **do not use tiles or flared-mouthed vessels (不得辄用瓦器，及绰口者)**.

**Otherwise, the medicine may scatter (恐药飞散)**, **the wine juice may be wasted (消耗酒汁)**, **and the proportions may be lost (致失准则)**. **The remaining methods are as before (余法如前)**. **The amount of medicine used is adjusted according to the increase or decrease of the lead (其用药随丹增损)**—**to determine the strength, weakness, or quality (以为多少衰降臧之也)**.

**The Refining of Lead with Cow Dung (牛粪取汁鼓铅法)**

In all cases where the juice of pressed and strained cow dung is used, it must be thickened to the consistency of congee. Thus, the common method of refining lead to make it white in color involves taking any quantity of fine wine and mixing it with white cinnabar (白炮砂) in the wine. The cinnabar should be gradually melted until it is fully dissolved, and this wine-cinnabar mixture is then blended with the dung juice to achieve the consistency of thin congee. After spreading it on a heavy cloth (厅路重布) and pressing, the resulting dung juice is used to mix with the medicinal elixir (药丹), moistening it thoroughly until it forms clusters like rooster eggs (团如鸡子)—it may also be left unclustered. Then, it is exposed to the sun to dry, placed in a furnace, and melted. After a short while, the lead emerges and is poured into a cow’s gallbladder (泻牛胆中). This process is repeated five times, and the lead will become white.

If white honey (白蜜) is used to submerge the elixir, like a strong paste, and then exposed to the sun as before, its potency will also be preserved. If the elixir hardens and the lead does not emerge, the white cinnabar must be removed. Though this lead may appear white, it is not the true method. If the refined lead from the nine transformations (九转丹铅) is not pleasing to the eye—its color being greenish-black and its texture soft—then its transformative power is beyond ordinary understanding (神化之力，不知所以然而然者也).

**The Nine-Transformation Divine Elixir of the Supreme Daoist (太极真人九转丹)**
**First Transformation (第一转):** Take five hundred *catty* of barite powder (胡粉), and mix it with twenty *catty* of rock salt (石盐) in one *dou* of water. Then, add one *dou* of cow dung juice to form clusters like rooster eggs (丸如鸡子) and dry them in the shade (阴乾). Place these in a furnace, refine them briefly, and the lead emerges—this is called *powder-lead* (粉铅), known as *Earth’s Essence* (地之精也). Take five *catty* of yellow cinnabar (黄丹), mix it with cow dung juice, form clusters like rooster eggs, and dry them in the shade. Place these in a furnace and refine them briefly, and the lead emerges—this is called *cinnabar-lead* (丹铅), known as *Heaven’s Essence* (天之精也).

**Second Transformation (第二转):** Take the previously refined *Heaven’s* and *Earth’s Essence* (天地之精), blend and roast them until they become a greenish-yellow powder like fine sand (水色青沙). Then, mix thirty *catty* of refined *stone alum* (石盥) with eight *dou* of hot water, and add salted water (日咸水). Grind this mixture in salted water until it turns a yellowish-brown powder like soil-colored sand (土色黄沙), then pulverize it finely and place it in a wok (铛器). Burn it for three days and three nights until it transforms into red sand like fire (火色赤沙), matching the color of fine cinnabar (与好丹色同). The process is complete.

**Third Transformation (第三转):** Take the refined cinnabar from the previous step and mix it with one *dou* of the milk of a firstborn son (首男乳). If firstborn son’s milk is difficult to obtain, yellow cow’s milk (黄牛乳) may be used instead. Add one *dou* of cow dung juice, thirty *catty* of refined rock salt (石盐明诤者), and eight *dou* of hot water, blending them thoroughly to submerge the cinnabar. Form clusters like rooster eggs, dry them in the shade, and refine them as before. The remaining steps follow the same method.

**Fourth Transformation (第四转):** Take the refined *Heaven’s* and *Earth’s Essence* from the previous three transformations, forming the elixir. Use twenty *catty* of fine, translucent, and radiant vermilion (朱砂), cook it in wine for twenty-one days (三七日), then pound it in a mortar and mix it with the medicine. Again, blend it with *Earth’s Strong Juice*—that is, cow dung juice (地强汁)—and form clusters like rooster eggs. Dry them in the shade, place them in the furnace, and refine them as before. All subsequent steps follow the same method as the nine transformations, but the medicinal ingredients differ.

**Fifth Transformation (第五转):** Take five *catty* of realgar with the color of a rooster’s comb (雄黄色如鸡冠者), boil it in genuine cow tallow (真牛酥) for seven days, then expose it to the sun. Mix it with the medicine as before. Then, combine one *dou* of wine and one *dou* of cow dung juice, blend them with the medicine to form clusters like rooster eggs, and dry them in the shade. Refine them as before; the remaining steps follow the same method.

**Sixth Transformation (第六转):** Take twenty *catty* of orpiment (雌黄) and five *catty* of *Wu* yellow alum (吴黄矾石), mix them with cow’s milk and hemp seed juice (麻子汁), and boil them for three days and nights. Dry them in the shade, pound and sift them, then blend with the medicine. Form clusters like rooster eggs with cow dung juice, dry them in the shade, and refine them as before.

**Seventh Transformation (第七转):** Take five *catty* of refined *stone green vitriol* (石曾青), along with one hundred cloves each of *dried ginger* (香附) and *white ginger* (白附), using fresh ones for better results. The remaining steps follow the same method as above.

**Eighth Transformation (第八转):** Take three *catty* of *martial salt* (戎盐), three *catty* of *crude sodium sulfate* (朴硝), and three *catty* of *mirabilite* (芒硝). Pound and sift them together with the medicine, then blend with cow dung juice to form clusters like rooster eggs. Dry them in the shade and refine them as before.

**Ninth Transformation (第九转):** Take the elixir from the previous eight transformations and place it according to the method on the *vital points of a person’s body* (其人生命上) and on *royal officials* (王相上). Establish an altar and perform rites of exorcism and sacrifice (立坛醮祭) as per the *Daoist Canon of the Divine Elixir* (丹经), maintaining purity through fasting and abstinence (洁清斋戒). Place the *Five Sacred Talismans of the Spirit Jewel* (灵宝五符) in the five cardinal directions, the *Twelve Divine Seals* (十二神印符) at the *hour of the day* (辰上), and the *Eight Sacred Talismans* (八灵符) in the eight cardinal directions. Cover the *Heavenly Gate* (天门), seal the *Earthly Portal* (地户), pass over the *Celestial Canopy* (华盖), and enter the *Yin realm* (阴中). Grind five *catty* of white jade into powder (为粉), and one *catty* of gold into flakes (为屑). Use the heart and liver of a green goat (青羊心肝各一具) to mix with the medicine and plaster the furnace. Blend the mixture with cow dung juice like rooster eggs and place it on the *vital points of a person’s body*. Dry it in the shade. When the *Heavenly Heart* (天心) aligns with the *Day of the Heavenly Heart* (天心日) and the *Hour of the Heavenly Heart* (天心时), place the refined elixir in the *Nine Palaces* (九宫) and mix it with the medicine. The attendant should remain in the *Central Palace* (中宫) tending the furnace.

First, it is said: *"The miraculous emergence from the palace is the finest."* After three days and nights, the elixir is complete. Form it into pills with white honey (丸以白蜜), and take two pills daily, each the size of a millet grain (如黍米粒). This can make one a *Supreme Daoist* (真人矣). Keep this secret and do not divulge it.

The scribe notes: Though this method involves nine transformations and adds hidden secrecy, the lead refined through nine transformations becomes a divine medicine (体为神药). Furthermore, the use of five *catty* of white jade as powder and one *catty* of gold as flakes—these two rare treasures—mixed and plastered onto the furnace, along with the heart and liver of a green goat (which are extremely difficult to obtain), and the milk of a firstborn son (首男乳汁) requiring ten *sheng* of measurement, is merely exaggerated for effect. The true method is to use obtainable medicines and complete the nine transformations. With this refined lead and elixir, fulfilling the *Nine Cauldrons* (九鼎), the Dao becomes even more wondrous, and its power even greater. Thus, the full account of its efficacy is presented, though it need not be laboriously detailed here.

**The Function and Potency of Cinnabar for Immortalizing the Dao (明丹砂功力能人长生之道用)**

The scribe notes: Medicines from grasses and woods can treat and cure illnesses but cannot achieve true longevity (不可以致长生也). Medicines from metals and minerals can certainly extend one’s lifespan and also eliminate a hundred evils (兼能除百邪也). Now, grasses and woods—being light, fragile, and easily damaged—cannot endure long. Boiled, they rot; buried, they decay; burned, they turn to ash; and left idle, they spoil.

「不能自坚，岂能坚人乎。不能自生，岂能生人乎。若丹砂之为物也，是称奇石，最为上药。细理红润，其质贞固坚秘，积转逾久，变化逾妙。

**The Daoist Canon of the Divine Elixir of the Yellow Emperor (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀) – Volume Twelve Complete, Volume Thirteen**

**The Function and Potency of Cinnabar for Immortalizing the Dao (明丹砂功力能人长生之道用)**

The scribe notes: It cannot fortify itself, how could it fortify others? It cannot sustain its own life, how could it give life to others? As for cinnabar (丹砂), it is called a wondrous mineral (奇石), the supreme among all medicines (上药). Its fine texture is vibrant red, its essence pure and enduring, firm yet mysterious—with time, its transformations grow ever more marvelous. It can ascend as powder (飞为粉), condense into essence as snow (精为雪), transmute into true mercury (为真汞), and become the elixir of return (还丹). It can repel fire (拒火) and dissolve into water (化水), yet when refined, it remains undiminished (消之可以不耗), and when buried, it does not spoil (埋之可以不坏). Its spiritual efficacy is wondrous and mysterious; I cannot fully describe it. To grasp its essence is to achieve full vitality (全生), but to fail in its method is to harm one’s lifespan (失法则伤寿).

**The Nature and Properties of Cinnabar for Healing (丹砂性味主疗)**

The scribe notes: The *Bencao* (本草) states that cinnabar (丹砂) is of sweet taste and slightly cold in nature, non-toxic, and governs the treatment of bodily ailments in the five viscera (五藏), a hundred diseases (百病), nourishes the spirit (精神), calms the soul and vital essence (魂魄), augments *qi* (氣) and illuminates the eyes (明目), harmonizes the blood vessels (通血脉), and alleviates vexation and thirst (止烦懑消渴). It also replenishes vitality (益精), enhances complexion (悦泽人面), wards off malevolent spirits and impurities (煞精邪恶鬼), dispels internal afflictions, intestinal pain (除中恶肠痛), and poisons such as scabies, eczema, and sores (毒气疥瘦诸疮). Prolonged consumption grants divine insight (通神明), prevents aging (不老), lightens the body (轻身), and achieves transcendence (神仙). It can transmute into mercury (化为汞), be ground into powder (调作末), and is known as true pearl (真珠), its luster resembling cloud mother (云母), and the best is that which can be broken apart. It grows in the valleys of the **Fengling Mountains (符陵山)**, and should be harvested at the **Yuan season (元时)**.*」

**On Cinnabar (丹砂) and Its Properties**

Cinnabar (恶磁石) fears saltwater. When it transforms into mercury (化为汞) and is called *true pearl* (真珠), it is also known as *golden sand* (金沙). The *Fengling Mountains* (符陵) refer to *Fuling* (涪陵), bordering the southern reaches of *Bajun* (巴郡)—now known as *Yuan* (元复采者).

**Sources of Cinnabar (丹砂出处):**
According to *Bencao* (《本草》), it is found in *Fuling* (符陵). Yet, since it is mined from the southern prefecture of *Bajun*, it is also called *Basha* (巴沙). Now, it is still harvested there, as well as in *Wuling* (武陵) and the *Xichuan* (西川) regions among the non-Han peoples. In ancient times, the *Ba* region was accessible, hence its name *Basha*. Daoist scriptures also use *Yuesha* (越沙), which comes from *Lindeng* (临邓) in *Guangzhou* (广州). These two sources are both excellent, provided their luster is bright and radiant.

If it resembles *cloud mother* (云母) in flakes, it is called *cloud mother sand* (云母沙). If it appears as *purple stone* (紫石) in larger forms, it is called *horse-tooth cinnabar* (马齿砂). All are of good quality and may be used in medicine, though they are not the finest material for refining.

If it forms large, smooth, bean-like masses, it is called *bean sand* (豆沙). If it is finely powdered and fragmented, it is called *powder sand* (末沙). These two varieties are inferior and are only suitable for grinding into vermilion (可磨作朱). Mining cinnabar always involves digging deep pits—even within the same prefecture or county, its quality varies. The methods for selecting and refining it are meticulously recorded, for the elixir of longevity is not fully detailed in *Bencao*.

Yet, though cinnabar is mined in *Ba* and *Chu* (巴楚), the finest today comes from *Maya County* (麻阳县) in *Zhenzhou* (辰州). When broken, it emits a fiery glow, with sparks resembling fireflies. When held to the light, it shimmers like moving luminous sand. If its texture is fine and it emits a brilliant white radiance when struck, it is called *cinnabar* (丹砂). The most superior is bright red, followed by purple, with muddy red being the lowest grade.

Heavenly cinnabar, already infused with fire, is rarely seen—even if obtained, it must first be subdued by fire. There is a variety from *Xingzhou* (兴州) that is dense and heavy, red in color, resembling cinnabar in appearance. When broken, it looks like iron; when burned, it turns red; when left exposed, it darkens; when heated, it does not melt—this is the true essence of cinnabar.

**Refining Methods for Cinnabar (丹砂调炼法):**

1. Take the finest cinnabar, grind it into powder, and place it in an iron vessel with the finest vinegar (上上醋). Simmer it over low heat, adding vinegar as needed without letting it run dry. After thirty-six days—or longer if it has not yet been subdued by fire—test it by burning. If it does not melt, it is refined. If not subdued, extend the process to a hundred days.

2. Use a *dou* (斗) of fine spring wine, place it in a porcelain jar, and add ten *liang* (两) of cinnabar in a silk pouch, ensuring it does not settle at the bottom. Replace the wine every ten days. After a hundred days, dry it in the sun and use it for longevity.

3. Another method: Take luminous, translucent cinnabar, boil it in wine for twenty-one days or more, then test it by fire to ensure it is subdued.

4. Another method: Crush cinnabar into bean-sized pieces, mix it with wine, and place it in a bamboo tube, then boil it in a pot. After half a day of heating, test its subduction by fire. If not yet refined, add water and boil again.

5. Another method: Take the finest cinnabar, place it in an iron vessel, and simmer it gently. Gradually add vinegar while stirring with a tool to prevent settling. For every *jin* (斤) of cinnabar, use a *dou* of vinegar. Once the vinegar is fully consumed and the cinnabar is extracted, dry it in the sun, place it in a sweet clay crucible, and refine it in a furnace. If it does not vaporize, it is complete. If it does vaporize, boil it for three more days and test again, repeating until success.

6. Another method: Take the finest cinnabar, crush it into bean-sized pieces, and place it in a copper vessel with strong vinegar. Simmer gently, gradually adding vinegar while stirring to prevent settling. Once the vinegar is fully consumed, dry it in the sun, then refine it by fire. If it does not vaporize, it is complete.

7. Another method: Take luminous, translucent cinnabar, grind it finely, and place it in a new earthenware bottle, sealing it tightly. Boil it in a pot for a hundred days to remove toxicity. This refined cinnabar is suitable for longevity. Alternatively, place it in a bottle with wine, which also prevents water contamination. Mixing it with wine ensures proper absorption into the bottle or pot.

8. Another method: Take bright, translucent cinnabar, grind it finely, and boil it in vinegar for a hundred days. When refined by fire without melting, it is called *subdued by fire* (伏火). This is used for alchemical transformations, not longevity.

**Reflections on Refining (臣诀者按):**
Though there are many methods for refining cinnabar, the key lies in ensuring it is *subdued by fire* (伏火). Ancient practitioners considered the varying intensity of fire, hence the use of prolonged boiling. They also accounted for human impatience, setting a limit of a hundred days. For longevity elixirs, it must be boiled in fine wine. For alchemical transformations, it must be boiled in strong vinegar.

When boiling in iron with wine, constant stirring is required. If placed in a bottle, it must be sealed tightly. After fully consuming the vinegar, remove and dry it, then test for subduction by fire. New bottles are preferred for longevity preparations, while copper or iron vessels are used for alchemical work. These methods are infallible.

**Alternative Method for Consuming Cinnabar (服丹砂别法):**
Take two *jin* of cinnabar, grind it into powder, sift it through fine silk, and place it in a copper basin. Pour strong, bitter wine over it until it forms a paste. Leave it in a dry, elevated place to dry. Repeat the process, using three *dou* of wine for every *jin* of cinnabar. After thirty days of drying, the mixture will turn purple—this is the completed medicine. It will not stain the hands when handled and will be malleable like honey.

Form it into pills the size of sesame seeds. Take three pills daily with spring water upon waking. After one day, intestinal parasites will be expelled. After six days, all bodily ailments will vanish. After sixty days, one will gain supernatural vision, regrow black hair where gray has been, and regenerate fallen teeth.

**Methods of Consuming Cinnabar (服丹砂别法):**

Before taking this medicine, one must first observe a thirty-day fast and purification, bathing with water infused with five kinds of fragrant aromatics before ingestion.

**Method of Consuming Cinnabar (服丹砂法):**
Take one *jin* of cinnabar, pound it into powder, and sift it. Add two *sheng* of refined lacquer and three *sheng* of strong, bitter wine, blending these three substances harmoniously. Simmer gently over fire until it can be formed into pills the size of sesame seeds, to be taken three times daily.

After ten days, all hundred ailments will be cured, and the Three Vermin (*sān shī*) will be expelled.
It is also said: After a hundred days of consumption, the skin will grow firm; after three years, longevity will be prolonged.

The scholar notes: Cinnabar alone, taken in isolation over time, still yields benefits as described above.
When the poison is removed by steaming in a clay vessel, and it is combined into the Great Elixir (*dà dān*), its efficacy is greatly enhanced.

Now, examining the previous methods of cinnabar alone and the two methods of blending with lacquer—all using refined vinegar, none mentioning wine—it is evident that the efficacy may be doubted if wine is omitted.

Additionally, there is a method where cinnabar is steeped in a clay bottle without needing vinegar.

According to the alternative method of blending cinnabar with lacquer, take one *jin* of true cinnabar, one *dou* of clear wine, one *jin* of white honey, and one *sheng* of refined lacquer. Steep the cinnabar daily in wine and honey, soaking and drying repeatedly until it can be formed into pills, then cease.

Another prescription: Blend cinnabar with clear wine, place it in a bamboo tube, and steam it for several days, as with the method of steeping and drying cinnabar. Form the mixture into pills with white honey.

Yet another method: Mix cinnabar with the juice of mulberry roots, place it in a bottle, and immerse it in boiling water for two days and nights. Then blend with refined wine and form into pills with white honey.

In all the blending methods above, first harmonize the cinnabar with wine until perfectly adjusted, then add the lacquer and steam it over the gentlest flame possible. Once it can be formed into pills, stop.

In the consumption method above, form the pills the size of sesame seeds. Initially, take two pills, twice daily. After forty days, the Three Vermin will depart; prolonged consumption leads to longevity and immortality, where one’s shadow is no longer visible at midday.

Thus, it is known that among all methods of refining cinnabar to remove its poison, none surpass the use of fine wine.

Some methods involve storing cinnabar in a new clay bottle, others in a bamboo tube. In either case, it must first be blended with clear wine.
It can be steamed or steeped; however,
Steaming requires continuous fire for a hundred days, and bamboo tubes may rot.
Steeping for a hundred days poses difficulties in maintaining uniform moisture due to varying hand dryness—how can it compare to storing it in a new clay bottle?
The wine’s vapor permeates and clarifies the cinnabar; the bottle absorbs and evenly moistens it, constantly nourishing it without effort. A single steaming session suffices to complete it.

The scholar notes: Among all minerals, only cinnabar and realgar are superior. Their refining methods are not overly difficult; combining them first to safeguard one’s life and vitality is also the foundation of essential elixirs for prolonging existence. Though not yet attaining the Great Elixir, no other supplementary medicines or tonics can rival this.

Moreover, the spirit of cinnabar is called mercury (*shuǐ yín*). When mercury is blended with cinnabar in equal parts and pounded together, placed in a copper vessel, and steamed for a day and night, it emerges as a watery substance. When placed over charcoal and heated, it becomes water—thus, it should appear purple-red. Form into honey pills the size of a bean, and its potency after a hundred days will be similar to that of cinnabar.

**Refining Realgar (雄黄) Method**

The efficacy of realgar lies in its power to attain longevity. According to my study: realgar and orpiment share the same origin, for orpiment transforms into realgar. Orpiment is called the great medicine of Heaven and Earth, and after eight thousand years, it transmutes into realgar—also known as *Dì Nán Jīng* (帝男精, "Imperial Male Essence"). After another thousand years, it further refines into gold, named *Zhēn Rén Fàn* (真人饭, "True Person’s Nourishment"), making it the most divine of stones.

For those who seek only to preserve their teeth from falling, prevent their hair from graying, strengthen sinews and bones, lighten the body, and sharpen vision, no remedy surpasses this elixir. It repels tigers, wolves, and a hundred poisons, keeping them at bay. When immersed in water, it fears no water dragons, and no venomous creatures or malevolent spirits dare approach. It also wards off the Five Weapons, possessing great might. It sharpens the senses, commands the spirits of a hundred beings, and is a singular marvel of divine transformation—the supreme elixir of longevity, the essential remedy for ailments, and the means to restore youth. No substance is beyond its influence.

In ancient times, the *Yuánqiū* (圆丘) altar was plagued by great serpents, yet it also bore fine medicines. When the Yellow Emperor prepared to ascend there, Master Guāngchéngzǐ (广成子) instructed him to wear realgar, and all the serpents departed. This demonstrates its immense power. Moreover, in the Daoist scriptures, realgar stands alone as the greatest of medicines.

**Realgar’s Therapeutic Uses**
According to the *Běn Cǎo* (本草): Realgar is bitter, sweet, and of a neutral, cold nature, with toxicity. It treats cold and fever, rodent paralysis, carbuncles, boils, hemorrhoids, dead flesh, scabies, hidden sores, eye pain, nasal polyps, severed sinews, shattered bones, wind accumulation in the joints, malignant abdominal pain, ghostly possession, malevolent spirits, evil *qi*, venomous creatures, and the poisons of the Five Weapons. It repels all serpents and viper venom, enhances complexion, and when refined and ingested, lightens the body and grants immortality. When taken as a medicine, it ascends directly to the brain, overcoming ghosts and spirits, prolonging life, and sustaining the body without hunger. It is also called *Huáng Shí* (黄食石, "Yellow Nourishment Stone").

**Realgar’s Sources**
According to my study: Realgar grows in the valleys of Wúdū (武都) and the slopes of *Dùnhuáng* (炖煌, *Dunhuang*). It may be gathered at any time, with the finest specimens resembling a rooster’s comb in color—firm, odorless, and solid. Those that are dull, black, or hollow are inferior.

The realgar from *Dùnhuáng*, located thousands of miles west of *Dòngzhōu* (冻州), is considered the most vital and rare of medicines. In the past, it was valued equally with red gold. Now, under the enlightened rule of the Holy Dynasty, with the world unified and no rebellions, treasures no longer hide in the earth, nor do mountains conceal their riches. The cliffs of Wúdū collapse daily, yielding realgar like the sun’s rays, transported to the capital without cost—its value exceeding even that of laborers’ wages, reduced to the price of tiles and stones. This is the blessing of a sage ruler in harmony with the Dao, a divine medicine of fortune, arriving without seeking.

Realgar of a murky red hue is inferior. Only the pure, bright red is supreme.

「**Methods for Refining Realgar to Remove Its Toxicity**

The humble servant observes: Though realgar is a supreme medicine for longevity (*chángshēng*), it possesses great toxicity. If its poison is not fully removed, it cannot be used in the *Great Elixir* (*Dà Dān*). The toxicity of mineral medicines intensifies with fire; even a hundredfold submerged fire (*fùhuǒ*—a method of detoxification) fails to eliminate the poison entirely.

Ordinary people, failing to grasp its true nature, mistakenly believe that substances which replace fire are free of toxicity—a grave error indeed. Therefore, one must first boil and refine it before subjecting it to fire.

This process resembles the detoxification of cinnabar (*gōngzhú*), for realgar can be refined either with vinegar or oil. Depending on its intended use, the methods differ, as detailed below.

**Method of Refining Realgar with Alcohol and Boiling in Vinegar**
Take the finest realgar, ten *jīn* in weight. Remove its stony veins (*shípài*), crush it into pieces the size of small *mùzi* (a measure, roughly a pea), or grind it into powder like sand, or pulverize it into dust like flour. If refining with oil, crush it into *mùzi*-sized pieces. If refining with alcohol, crush it into powder, then soak it thoroughly in good-quality wine within a copper vessel. Stir until fully saturated, then add more wine until two *dàn* (a measure, roughly 100 liters) are used.

Next, boil it with oil. After removing the oil, crush it into powder, and incorporate it into the *Great Elixir*. Alternatively, refine it with bitter wine until complete.

For those who wish to take it alone: Grind it into fine powder, place it in a bamboo tube, and add one *jīn* of *shìyú* (a type of salted brine or mineral solution). Cover the tube with a stone lid, seal its mouth tightly, and steam it in sand for seven days and nights. When removed, if there is liquid, drain it. The residue that does not dissolve in water should be placed in a silk pouch, stored in a honey jar, sealed securely, and buried in horse dung for seven days. When the process is complete, the medicine is formed, known as *Zǐgōng Fēi Dān* (Purple Palace Flying Elixir). Roll it into pills the size of white honey beans (*báimì*), and taking them over time will extend one’s years.

**Method of Refining Realgar with Vinegar**
Refine realgar with vinegar: Take one *jīn* of the finest realgar, crush it into powder, and mix it with good-quality bitter wine. Combine thoroughly in a copper vessel and simmer gently over low fire (*huǎnhuǒ*), never with fierce flames, until one *dàn* of wine is fully consumed. The refined mixture will resemble glue.

*Formula’s Note:* This "bitter wine" is not vinegar but rather a strong, aged wine.

After boiling, crush it into powder and place it in a bamboo tube. Steam it for one day and night. When the vapor turns greenish-red (*qīngchì*), remove it and place it in water. The residue will clump like cotton; roll it into pills the size of *wúzi* (a measure, roughly a walnut). Take one pill before meals, three times daily, and one will attain the state of the *Immortal* (*shénxiān*).

If realgar is mixed with lacquer (*qī*) for ingestion, use good-quality clear wine instead. Simmer it gently over low fire until it thickens like glue. For one *jīn* of realgar, use two *jīn* of lacquer, ensuring the lacquer is fresh and green. After boiling and straining, discard the dregs (*zhé*), and blend the mixture in a copper vessel until thoroughly combined. The medicine is now complete.

Roll it into pills the size of millet grains (*shúmǐ*), and take three daily. If rolled into smaller pills the size of adzuki beans (*xiǎodòu*), take one daily. Before ingestion, chew the pill and swallow the juice, discarding the residue. After fourteen days, all ailments will be cured. After twenty days, the skin will become supple and the dead flesh will slough off—this is the effect of the medicine’s power.

Walking at night will be like daytime; movement will be swift as a flying dragon. In cold weather, the body will feel warm; in heat, it will feel cool. After a hundred days, the intestines will be firm and strong, the skin and blood vessels resilient, and the bones, joints, ears, and eyes sharp and clear.

By three hundred days, one may gradually increase the dosage to swallowing pills the size of millet and sorghum grains (*shúsu*), with three pills as the daily norm. This method is divine and secret; do not casually divulge it.

Though called the *Lesser Elixir* (*xiǎodān*), it surpasses all other minerals and superior herbs of the earth. Before the *Great Elixir* is complete, one must first use this medicine to fortify the marrow (*guīsùi*), sustaining oneself.

If this refined realgar is to be incorporated into the *Great Elixir*, it must be boiled for a full hundred days, never stopping until it thickens like glue.

**Method of Refining Realgar for Longevity Medicines**
After soaking and removing it, let the realgar dry thoroughly in the sun. Grind it into fine powder for use. Select the brightest, most luminous red pieces, crush them into powder, and place them in a new earthenware bottle. Soak the powder in wine, seal the bottle tightly, and boil it in a steamer for a hundred days. Alternatively, place the wine in the pot and boil the bottle within it—this method is superior.

This is for use in longevity medicines and elixir preparations. Take one *shēng* (a measure, roughly 3.78 liters) of good spring wine, pour it into a porcelain jar (*bìgāng*), and place ten *liǎng* (a measure, roughly 37.5 grams) of realgar in a white cloth pouch within the jar. Replace the wine every ten days, continuing for a hundred days total.

**Method of Refining Realgar for Transmuting Copper and Iron**
Take the finest realgar with a rooster-crest hue (*jīguān sè*). In a copper vessel, boil it with good, pure vinegar for a hundred days. Test its detoxification by submerging it in fire without residue (*wúyīn*—indicating complete removal of toxicity). When successful, it is called *Fùhuǒ* (Subdued Fire). It can then be used to transmute and perfect metals instantly.

**Method of Heavy Refining with Oil: Removing Realgar’s Impurities**
Take the finest realgar with a rooster-crest hue, select its purest parts, and remove the stony veins. Crush it into pieces the size of small *mùzi*. Boil these in an oil wok (*yóuchuán*).

First, refine it thoroughly with wine for a full day. Then, boil it in oil for nine days and nights without pause. Carefully monitor the heat—if the oil is too hot, the *fat flame* (*zhīyàn*) will rise, and if the heat is too slow, the poisonous *qi* will not dissipate.

Cover the wok with an earthenware lid and wait until the steam can be held in the palm (*tǎngshǒu*—a test for proper heat). When the days are complete and the oil is extremely hot, pour it out carefully, ensuring all oil is drained. The realgar will then solidify into a mass that does not fall. Pour it out while still very hot, straining the oil evenly. Use a silk pouch, each capable of holding two *jīn*, with five pouches totaling ten *jīn*, each pouch nine *cùn* (a measure, roughly 30 cm) long.

Alternatively, fashion a *soil cauldron* (*tǔ’áo*) from clay, one *chǐ* (a measure, roughly 30 cm) high, with an eight *cùn* mouth facing upward. On all four sides of the cauldron’s top, firmly attach small clay basins (*huò*), shaped like earthenware jars (*tǔ’ōu*), and fill them with sand. Place the realgar pouches on the sand, ensuring each pouch is spaced one *cùn* apart, and fill the cauldron with sand until it is level with the pouches’ tops. Below the sand, arrange seven bundles of firewood, and observe the pouches until the fat is fully absorbed by the sand.

**Method of Relocating Refined Realgar’s Toxicity**
After steaming and refining with sand, place the realgar in a new earthenware bottle. Wrap the bottle tightly with sweet clay mud (*gāntǔ ní*), half an inch thick, and bake it until dry. Seal the bottle’s mouth with a competing substance (*zhēngwù*—likely a stopper or sealant), and weigh it down in a fixed location. First, mold a clay shape resembling the bottle or jar.

The mouth of this clay shape should be thick like the side of a palm, and its height like a clenched fist. Fill it with white sand, pressing it firmly until full. Place it in a furnace and dry it thoroughly.

**Method of Transmuting Realgar’s Toxicity with Lacquer**
Take the refined realgar from the sand-steaming process, wrap it in a white cloth pouch, and place it in a new earthenware bottle. Seal the bottle tightly with clay mud, ensuring it is half an inch thick, and bake it until dry. Use a lacquer (*qī*) mixture to cover the bottle’s mouth, and weigh it down in a fixed location.

First, mold a clay shape resembling the bottle or jar. The mouth of this clay shape should be thick like the side of a palm, and its height like a clenched fist. Fill it with white sand, pressing it firmly until full. Place it in a furnace and dry it thoroughly.

「Then, invert the bottle’s mouth over the clay shape, plug the bottle’s mouth with disordered hair, and spread a layer of paper on the sand. Secure it with small iron nails across the mouth to block the hair, ensuring the oil vapor descends and the medicine does not spill chaotically.

Once the bottle is settled, wait until it is thoroughly dry, then fill and tamp it with horse dung. Ignite the fire from above, allowing it to burn downward so that the bottle’s oil vapor drips onto the sand and gradually dissipates. After a day and night, when the vapor has subsided (*when the bottle is clear*), retrieve it.

While still hot, use tongs to hold the bottle upright, remove its mouth, and pierce a hole the size of a *Confucius* (小孔). The medicine inside the bottle will appear like turbid water. Cast it into vessels of any desired shape or size—this is called *wu yin* (無姻), a substance that repels evil.

If the vapor is not fully exhausted, break the bottle and collect the residue. The oil will be gone, and only the medicine remains, with all toxic vapors eliminated.

To consume it directly, those who immediately obtain it should sift it into powder, take three *turns of snow* (三转雪), steam it for three days, and form it into pills with white honey. Then, swallow it like a pea-sized pill.

Take three doses daily, gradually reducing the amount, to expel the three kinds of worms (*三虫*) and achieve longevity (*longsheng/long life*).

Mixing it with refined pine resin (*song zhi*) is also beneficial. This method can be used to produce multiple doses for consumption.

**Method of Refining Pine Resin**
If using mulberry ash (*sang hui*) or lime juice (*shi hui zhi*), boil it repeatedly, then rinse with water until all bitterness is removed.

**Method of Refining Orpiment**
According to my notes: The method of refining orpiment (*qí huáng*) differs little from that of realgar (*xióng huáng*). However, as *Bencao* (《本草》) states: Its medicinal efficacy differs from realgar. When making *Da Dan* (大丹, Great Elixir), this substance is especially required, hence its inclusion here.

Orpiment (*qí huáng*) is sweet, spicy, and balanced in nature, yet has toxicity. It treats malignant sores, baldness, ringworm, and scabies; kills poisonous insects and mites; alleviates itching; dispels all malevolent *qi*; removes nasal polyps; cures lower-body sores; eliminates white patches on the skin; revives deadened flesh; and counteracts dizziness and evil *qi*, neutralizing the venom of bees and snakes.

When refined, it lightens the body, prolongs life without aging, and fills one’s mind with clarity (*nǎo mǎn*—lit. "brain full"). It is mined from the same mountains as realgar, both found in the valleys of *Wudu* (武都), specifically in the yin-facing slopes. Where there is gold, the essence of gold refined by heat produces orpiment.

It can be gathered at any time. From *Wudu’s* *Chouchi* (仇池), it is yellow with a slight reddish hue. If sourced from *Funan* (扶南) or *Linyi* (林邑) in the south, it is called *true Kunlun* (真昆仑), yellow in color like gold, yet with a luster resembling mica, highly prized by painters.

Yet in alchemical practice, it is often combined with realgar in sublimation, sharing its yin-yang distinction. When used alongside realgar, the orpiment from *Wudu* is superior.

The best quality contains white, firm, and lustrous veins within its fracture.

**On the Virtue and Power of Stone Orpiment**

**Stone Orpiment’s Efficacy**
The scribe notes: Stone orpiment can transmute gold, silver, copper, and iron. Daoist scriptures frequently employ it. When burned, it yields a violet vapor, while its yellow and white residues are essential for cutting substances—thus its necessity in alchemical methods. When submerged in mercury, it is called *huángníngshā* (黄秾沙). With nitre, it transforms into liquid. This method derives from the *Thirty-Six Water Methods Scripture*.

Another method: grind stone orpiment into powder, place it in a bamboo tube, and thin its outer layer. Bury it in horse dung for twenty days, and it will liquefy. This liquid, when applied to elixirs, is called *liúhuáng yè* (流黄液). To refine it, take the finest *guāngmíngshā* (光明砂), steep and decoct it in wine, then grind it. Mix with orpiment in a copper vessel, simmer gently, and boil in repeated batches—this yields the best result. After seven to eight days, its color changes; by ten days, it becomes paste-like, forming pills the size of *wútóng* seeds (梧桐子). Take three daily, gradually increasing to forty. With prolonged use, one achieves lightness and may ascend to Dao.

This is the virtue and power of orpiment.

**Stone Orpiment’s Therapeutic Uses**
The scribe notes: Stone orpiment is sour and warm, with toxicity. It treats:
- Female genital parasites,
- Ulcers, hemorrhoids, and malignant blood,
- Rigid sinews, baldness, abdominal masses,
- Pathogenic *ling* (玲, a TCM term for stagnant or harmful energy),
- Inverted breathing and upward-rising *qi*,
- Weak, painful legs lacking strength,
- Nasal polyps and malignant sores,
- Lower-body ulcers, wound healing, and scabies eradication.

Folk remedies favor it for leg weakness and *ling*-related ailments. The scribe further notes: *Shíliúhuángdān* (石流黄丹) is the red essence of stone, akin to but distinct from orpiment itself. It seeps between cliffs, and when damp, may be pill-formulated; when solid, it is powdered. This singular stone encompasses one hundred twenty varieties, though their names exist without visual confirmation—yet it ranks among the supreme Daoist elixirs. The Five Sacred Peaks possess it, with *Jīshān* (箕山) being most abundant. Folklore claims *Xǔ Yóu* (许由) consumed it to attain longevity, thus rejecting imperial offerings and declining Yao’s abdication.

**Origins of Stone Orpiment**
The scribe notes: Orpiment grows in the valleys of *Shùhǎi* (束海, modern Xu Province), *Mùyángshān* (牧阳山), *Tàishān* (泰山), and the *Héxī* (河西) mountains. It is the essence of alum stone. Though *Shùhǎi* belongs to Xu Province, *Jīshān* also yields it. Today, the finest comes from *Fúnán* and *Línyí* (林邑), resembling a parrot freshly hatched—named *Kūnlún huáng* (昆仑黄), deep in hue and superior. This variety is prized in folk remedies for leg weakness and *ling*-related disorders. However, for high-alchemy (*dàdān*), *Línyí* orpiment cannot surpass that of Xu Province or *Jīshān*. Since the south lacks alum, its classification as "alum essence" remains unclear.

**Refining Stone Orpiment for Longevity Elixirs**
The scribe notes: The *Jiǔxiāo Jūn* (九霄君) prescribes a nine-fold lead elixir, incorporating orpiment into longevity formulas. The four key ingredients—*zhūshā* (朱砂, cinnabar), *xiónghuáng* (雄黄, realgar), *cíhuáng* (雌黄, orpiment), and *liúhuáng*—are each decocted separately in wine over gentle heat. For every five *shāng* (升) of wine, steep five *liǎng* (两) of powder, ensuring gradual saturation without abrupt addition. This prepares the elixir for longevity.

Alternative method: crush orpiment to the size of large beans, place in a bamboo tube with vinegar, and boil for three days and nights, resting halfway before adding water. Though effective for transformation, wine decoction surpasses it.

**On the Virtue and Power of *Céngqīng* (曾青) in Longevity Elixirs**
The scribe notes: *Céngqīng* ranks among the supreme Daoist elixirs. Prolonged consumption lightens the body and prevents aging. It transmutes copper, iron, and lead into gold.

**Therapeutic Uses of *Céngqīng***
The scribe notes: *Céngqīng* is sour, slightly cold, and non-toxic. It treats:
- Eye pain and excessive tearing,
- Wind-induced numbness, joint mobility,
- Dissolving masses and stagnations,
- Nourishing the liver and gallbladder,
- Alleviating cold-heat imbalances,
- Eradicating white parasites,
- Migraines and brain coldness,
- Abdominal distension and *yáng* deficiency.

**Origins of *Céngqīng***
The scribe notes: *Céngqīng* is found in Shù and Yùe’s valleys, harvested year-round. It shares properties with *kōngqīng* (空青, azurite) but avoids silk moth cocoons. Today, it is sourced from *Shǐxīng* (始兴) and *Wùzhōu* (蔚州), with *Wùzhōu* superior. Inferior varieties come from other regions. Its texture resembles earthworm droppings or *huánglián* (黄连, coptis), with slipperiness indicating quality. Its luster slightly surpasses *kōngqīng*, making it rare and costly. Daoist scriptures value it, though *Táo Yǐnjū* (陶隐居) deemed it scarce. Its gold-transmutation methods mirror those of *kōngqīng*.

**Refining *Céngqīng***
The scribe notes: Steep *céngqīng* in fine wine, place in a copper vessel, and cover with paper under sunlight. In summer, seven days suffice, though prolonged exposure enhances potency. Without sunlight, gentle heat suffices. Dry thoroughly, then grind in a porcelain mortar with a jade pestle until powdered. Mix with concentrated vinegar, adjusting moisture as needed.

Alternative method: seal *céngqīng* in a dense silk pouch, submerge in a porcelain jar with vinegar (ten *liǎng* of *céngqīng* to one *shāng* of vinegar), and suspend the pouch. Replace vinegar every ten days; after a hundred days, use one *dòu* (斗) of vinegar. The pouch must not touch the jar’s base.

Another method: refine *céngqīng* with *jīnjīng* (金精, gold essence) separately in porcelain, grinding each into powder. Steep with *sān zhuǎn zuǒ wèi* (三转左味, a three-fold left-alchemical agent) for two hundred days, dry, and pulverize in a porcelain basin with a jade pestle.

Final method: refine *céngqīng* as with orpiment—crush to bean size, place in a bamboo tube with vinegar, and boil for three days and nights, resting halfway before reheating.

This method is not unknown, but it is a hasty minor technique, insufficient for reliance.

Another method: crush into powder, then boil with *sān zhuǎn zuǒ wèi* (三转左味). For one *jīn* (斤) of *céngqīng*, use a gentle fire to exhaust five *dǒu* (斗) of vinegar, and stop.

Dry thoroughly and grind to completion; it is then ready for medicinal use.

**Refining Magnetite (磁石) Method**
This is also similar to refining *céngqīng*. This is the Nine-Heaven Lord’s (九霄君) Nine-Transformations Lead Elixir method. Though there are authoritative references, it is still inferior to the superior method of refining gold essence with *céngqīng* as described above.

**The Virtue and Power of *Kōngqīng* (空青)**
According to records: *Kōngqīng*, when taken over time, lightens the body, prolongs life, prevents aging, prevents forgetfulness in the elderly, and elevates one’s spirit toward immortality. It can also be used in elixir formulation—when refined, it transmutes lead into gold.

The *Shénnóng* [classic] states: *"It transmutes copper, iron, and lead into gold."*

Its therapeutic uses are also similar to *céngqīng*, with minor variations. The following are recorded as such:

**Therapeutic Uses of *Kōngqīng***
According to records: *Kōngqīng* is of sweet and sour taste, intensely cold, and non-toxic. It treats:
- *Qīngmáng* (青盲, visual impairment from cold)
- Deafness
- Clarifies vision
- Opens the nine orifices
- Circulates the blood vessels
- Nourishes the spirit
- Strengthens liver *qi*
- Treats red, painful eyes and skin ulcers
- Stops excessive tearing
- Facilitates urination
- Promotes lactation
- Unblocks joints
- Dissolves hardened accumulations

**Sources of *Kōngqīng***
According to records: *Kōngqīng* is found in the mountains and valleys of Yìzhōu (益州), as well as in Yuè (越) and Jùn (隽). Currently, the finest quality—deepest in color—comes from Tóngguān (同官). That from Shǐxīng (始兴) is inferior to that of Yìzhōu. In Dòngzhōu’s (冻州) Xīpíng (西平), there is also a *Kōngqīng* mountain with abundant deposits, though they are solid and round like iron beads, lacking hollow cavities. These are excavated from soil and stone without seasonal restrictions.

Now, with the Emperor’s virtuous governance, all things flourish. Thus, *Kōngqīng* is also found in Wèizhōu (蔚州), Jiǎnzhōu (简州), Xuānzhōu (宣州), and Zǐzhōu (梓州). Among these, Xuānzhōu’s is the finest. That from Wèizhōu is dense, block-like, and lacks pores.

**Refining *Kōngqīng* for Immortal Elixirs**
According to records: Crush *Kōngqīng* into powder and refine it like *céngqīng*, steeping it in alcohol for a hundred days before drying and re-crushing. Then mix with vinegar and dry it ten times. Essentially, the process aligns with that of *céngqīng*.

If refining *jiàngfán* (绛矾, red vitriol), simply steep *Kōngqīng* once in alcohol and dry it—no further repetition is needed.

**Refining *Shílù* (石碌) Method**
According to records: In current elixir formulations, this substance is unnecessary. However, the *Tāiyī Shénjīng* (太一神精) method for minor elixirs states: *"If *céngqīng* is unavailable, use *Kūnlún shílù* (昆仑石碌), grind it into powder, and extract its essence for use."*

Additionally, according to the *Běncǎo* [classic]: *"Shílù* grows within *Kōngqīng*, attached to it. It is also called *lùqīng* (碌青), with a sour, cold nature and no toxicity. It strengthens *qi*, treats liver and nasal disorders, stops diarrhea, and is found in mountain caves, colored greenish-white. It is used by painters for green pigments—artisans call it *bìqīng* (碧青, verdigris), while *Kōngqīng* is called *lǜqīng* (绿青, green malachite).

If substituting *céngqīng* in formulations, it must first be water-fly-purified. From ten *liǎng* of refined essence, three *liǎng* can be obtained. However, when refined like *Kōngqīng*, it is suitable only for minor elixirs. For major elixirs, it cannot replace other substances.

**On Refining Stones for Longevity**

**The Virtue and Power of Magnetite (Císhí 磁石)**
The scribe notes: Magnetite is counted among the Five Stones, the essence of Great Yin. Its taste is pungent and salty, cold in nature, and non-toxic. It neutralizes iron’s toxicity, yet is feared by cinnabar and liquid mercury. It is widely used in elixirs of yellow and white Daoist alchemy.

**Magnetite’s Therapeutic Uses**
The scribe notes: Magnetite treats wind-induced numbness, wind-dampness, aching joints that prevent holding objects, acidity and pain upon washing, dispels intense heat and fullness, cures deafness, nourishes the kidneys, strengthens stomach *qi*, augments essence, alleviates restlessness, frees the joints, dissolves atrophy and rodent ulcers, relieves stiff necks and sore throats, and calms infantile convulsions. When refined into water and ingested, it ensures fertility. It is also called *Xuànshí* (玄石) and *Chǔshí* (处石), with *Cháihú* (柴胡) as its messenger herb, while it is antagonized by peony and *mángcǎo* (莽草) and fears *huángshízhī* (yellow stone pitch).

**Magnetite’s Origins**
The scribe notes: Magnetite grows in the streams and valleys of Mount Tài, and on the sunlit slopes of *Císhān* (Magnetite Mountain) where iron is present. It may be harvested at any time. The finest specimens can suspend and attract needles, with three or four linked strands being optimal. Currently, the best quality is found in *Xiàngzhōu* (Relative State).

**Method for Refining Magnetite into Longevity Elixirs**
Take one *jīn* of magnetite for longevity formulations. Grind it into powder and boil with *zuǒwèi* (left-flavor vinegar) over gentle fire until five *shēng* of liquid remains. Remove and dry it; the residue is unusable.

**Alternative Refining Method**
For magnetite to be combined with *céngqīng* (blue vitriol), boil it in five *shēng* of vinegar. No soaking is required.
Another method states: Coarsely grind magnetite and boil it in bitter wine for three nights, after which it is ready for use.

---

**The Virtue and Power of Alum (Fánshí 礜石)**
The scribe notes: Alum is the essence of Lesser Yin, counted among the Five Stones. When refined and ingested, it grants immortality and eternal youth. In Daoist alchemy texts and yellow-white elixir formulas, it is highly prized. It softens gold and prevents water from freezing.

Also called *Qīngjièshí* (青介石), *Lìzhìshí* (立制石), *Gùyángshí* (固羊石), *Bái fánshí* (白礜石), *Tàibáishí* (太白石), *Zéirǔ* (泽乳), and *Shíyán* (石盐).

**Alum’s Therapeutic Uses**
The scribe notes: Alum’s taste is pungent and sweet, with intense heat and toxicity. It treats cold-heat disorders, rodent ulcers, dead flesh, wind-spleen, abdominal hardness, and pathogenic *qi*. It dispels heat, sharpens vision, descends rebellious *qi*, removes heat from the diaphragm, stops diabetes, benefits liver *qi*, dissolves accumulations, cures chronic alcoholism, alleviates cold abdominal pain, removes nasal polyps, and—when taken long-term—strengthens tendons. It thrives with fire but fears water, is antagonized by *dúgōng* (toad venom), and uses *xìxīn* (fine cinnamon) and *hǔzhǎng* (tiger paw) as messengers.

**Alum’s Origins**
The scribe notes: Alum grows in the mountains and valleys of *Hànzhōu* (Han Prefecture) and *Shàoshì* (Lesser Room Mountain). It may be harvested at any time. The finest specimens also come from *Shǔ Hàn* (Sichuan-Han), *Nán Yě* (Southern Wilds), the borders of *Péngchéng* (Peng City), and the southern walls of *Luòyáng* (Luoyang). Among these, the alum from *Shàoshì* is the hottest. If it resembles yellow clay and is half an inch thick, burning it with charcoal fire for a day and night will cause it to crack open, making it suitable for treating cold obstructions—but it cannot be used in major elixirs. The alum used by Daoists is specifically *Bái fánshí* (white alum), not ordinary alum.

**Method for Refining Alum into Longevity Elixirs**
The scribe notes: Alum is toxic and intensely hot, thriving with fire. Thus, the *Béncǎo* (Herbal Classic) states: It must be fire-refined for a hundred days before ingestion in pill form, as it can kill humans and beasts. If dissolved into water, it effectively neutralizes latent mercury.

**Refining Method**
Take the finest alum, grind it into powder, wrap it in paper to form pellets, and seal it in a kiln with yellow clay (thickened to half an inch). Build a furnace around it with charcoal and ignite for fourteen days. Once the drug has been used for a hundred days, its efficacy is superior. It may then be incorporated into yellow-white elixirs.

**Alternative Method**
Boil alum in *dǔzhī* (stacked fat) for seven nights, dry it, grind it, and soak it in bitter wine until it forms a paste. Mold it into a ball and subject it to fierce fire until it turns into copper. Then grind it into powder, mix it with refined mercury, and use it according to the formula.

**Nine-Heavens Lord’s Nine-Transformation Lead Elixir Method for Refining Alum**
Grind alum into powder, mix it with cow dung juice to form a paste, and place it in a furnace for a day and night. Remove it, pound it in a mortar, and regrind it until it is ready for substitution. Boil it in two *dòu* of water, reducing it to five *shēng*, then let it cool overnight. It should congeal slightly before removal. Use three *dòu* of three-year-old bitter wine, boil it three times, and store it in a sealed vessel with a clay lid. After fourteen days, if the surface forms a two-*fēn* thick crust, use the refined *pǔxiāo* (crude natron) essence to cover the *Tàiyī Zhāohún Dān* (Great Unity Summon-Soul Elixir) and the congealed mercury. Refine this into the essence for longevity elixirs—its potency far surpasses unrefined alum.

---

**The Virtue and Power of Mirabilite (Mángxiāo 芒硝)**
The scribe notes: Mirabilite is refined from crude natron (*pǔxiāo*). Thus, the *Shénnóng Běnjīng* (Divine Farmer’s Classic) lists only natron, not mirabilite—yet mirabilite possesses transformative power. Hence, *Péng Jūn* (Master Peng) says: True natron, military salt, stone bile, and mirabilite—though they may have yin-yang or orthodox variations—exhibit divine efficacy in their transformations. If one seeks immortality without mastering this method, they may waste ten thousand gold pieces yet gain nothing. This is the true essence of Daoist alchemy.

Its therapeutic uses align with those of natron, suggesting mirabilite *is* natron. Thus, the *Shénnóng Běncǎo* does not distinguish between them. The finest quality originates from *Níngzhōu* (Ning Prefecture), white with large grains and an extremely bitter, pungent taste. If refined by physicians, it appears snow-white with fine grains and a less intense flavor. It is derived from natron, and the refined product is superior.

Additionally, according to the *Chūn Huā Huápí* (Spring Blossom Pool) method: Take seven transformations of spring mirabilite, five *dàn* of black-colored stone (from the Five-Colored Mountain Pitch, known as *Hàohuáng Fán* [august yellow alum]), which is not five separate substances. Use five *dòu* of natron and five *jīn* of mirabilite.

Now, examining the two natrons, they are distinguished by their names, while the Five-Colored Mountain Pitch is specified as three *dòu*. Clearly, this indicates that the Five-Colored Mountain Pitch refers to a single substance.

The *Spring Blossom Pool* method states: Each differs in its *dàn* (crude form), placed within spring mirabilite, sealed for three *qī* (sevens) days to complete.

All transformations and refinements into yellow or white forms, altering the Five Metals, employ this *Spring Blossom Pool* method. The most secretive of all, the *Ten Thousand Gold* method, is never transmitted.

But mirabilite is produced by refining natron, and this method uses both substances to achieve their transcendent power—its efficacy is profound. The **therapeutic uses of mirabilite** are as follows:

According to the臣 (*chén*, "this official"): Mirable natron is of bitter, pungent taste, and intensely cold. It treats accumulations in the Five *Zàng* (organs), internal heat with stomach closure, dissipates *bèi* (back) *qì* (vital force) fragments and lingering blood, resolves phlegm-induced blockages and masses in the abdomen, unbinds the channels and vessels, promotes urination and defecation, and regulates menstrual flow and the Five *Lín* (types of urinary dysfunction). **Pteris stone** serves as its messenger herb, while it fears **millet seed** and ginger. If mirabilite is refined into natron, it treats abdominal distension from heat, nourishes the stomach and aids digestion, dispels pathogenic *qì*, and also dissolves in water—its therapeutic effects align with those of true natron. The refining method is detailed within the natron section.

**Sources of mirabilite**: According to the臣 (*chén*): Mirable natron originates from natron, found in the mountains and valleys of **Yìzhōu** (Benefit Prefecture). Natron is also said to share the same mountains as natron, indicating their similar efficacy and origins. Though natron and natron are not identical, they are largely alike with minor differences.

Natron is described as **granular like held salt and snow**, not melting under strong pressure, and when burned, it emits **purple-green, amorous flames**, then turns to ash without boiling or yielding liquid—this is natron. If it boils and produces liquid, it is natron. If carefully examined for color and nature, they should not be hastily distinguished.

Natron grows in the **sunlit slopes of mountains** where there are **bitter, salty waters**. The finest quality comes from **Níngzhōu** (Ning Prefecture).

**Method for refining natron into mirabilite**: According to the臣 (*chén*): Though mirabilite has crude and refined forms, its transformative power and effects are divine. Since it is already derived from natron, it is a substance that has undergone refining—one should not further refine what has already been refined.

Now, the method for refining natron into mirabilite is as follows: Regardless of the natron’s quantity, first sift and grind it. Use **warm water** to extract its essence, clarify the liquid, and boil it—always reducing it to half its volume. Place the residue in a **wooden basin soaked in clear water**, and after a night, it will form—**crystals resembling white quartz in size**, each with eight facets.

Handle it carefully to avoid contamination. Strictly avoid mixing it with other substances or allowing onlookers during the process, as this will disrupt its **refined *qì* (vital essence)**, and the transformation will fail. Only **replacing the clear water** in the wooden basin will hasten its formation. Do not use unclean water; this method’s efficacy depends entirely on the purity of the water.

The official submits that this is what is required to produce the eight varieties of nitre. Among the eight types of nitre, there are *shípí* (石脾) and nitre. It is proposed to refine thirty-six waters, and *shípí* is also a refined substance, yet it cannot stand alone—it must rely on refining crude natron. The text states that mirabilite aids in this process, and only then can the transformation of all waters be fully effective.

Now, when people see in the mirabilite method the phrase *"exhausting its efficacy,"* they mistakenly believe that mirabilite alone can produce water—how greatly they are misled! *Shípí* is a single substance that few recognize. Without it, nitre and its waters cannot be properly formed. Those who can produce it achieve divine efficacy.

Thus, the method’s application—when used to make nitre—is infallible, its Dao/Way complete.

The mirabilite method further states: *"This transforms and produces all external waters, fully effective."*

**Method for Producing *Shípí* (石脾) Powder**
To produce *shípí* powder, refined saltpeter (*róngyán*—戎盐) is required. The method for refining *róngyán* is identical to the true process, and together they form nitre to refine the waters. Though both are included in the nitre methods, they are reiterated here for emphasis in relation to mirabilite.

**Method for Producing *Shípí* (石脾)**
Take one *jīn* of true white alum (*zhēnbái fánshí*—真白矾石) and one *jīn* of *róngyán*. Grind each separately into powder. Place two *shāng* of bitter water in a pot, boil it four or five times, then add the powders and simmer until half remains. Filter out the dregs, then boil again until the liquid is exhausted. When it boils anew, *shípí* forms—a white substance like snow. Using this to make nitre is always effective, its efficacy divine and complete.

**Method for Producing *Róngyán* (戎盐)**
Take any quantity of pure rock salt, melt it in an iron vessel until boiling, then add powdered white alum. Remelt it in brine, then add powdered *gānlíng* (乾灵), covering it tightly. Repeat this threefold refining process to produce *róngyán*—its transformation indistinguishable from the true substance.

**Five-Colored Divine Salt**
Peng Jun says: *"This is the sovereign of all medicines. If one makes the five-colored divine salt, using the essences of the Five Emperors, it becomes the five-colored divine *yàn* (盥)."*

**East Wilds Mirabilite Method**
Take any quantity of *xiánjīng* (咸精, salt essence), place it in an earthen pot with bitter water, and boil it ten times. Strain and clarify, then immerse it in *ruògǔcǎo* (若骨草) brine for two days. Transfer the *ruògǔcǎo* brine to a copper pot and boil until the liquid is exhausted—it will congeal into white mirabilite. If one wishes it to form facets, do not boil the liquid dry. Instead, place it in a clean porcelain vessel and store it in a shaded location for three days—it will crystallize into large, faceted mirabilite.

This mirabilite is indistinguishable from the true substance and can also purify the body.

**Essential Method for *Rògǔcǎo* (苦骨草, *Ruògǔcǎo*)**
The *Rògǔcǎo* is *kǔcān* (苦参, *Kǔcān*). Its bitterness penetrates to the bones, hence its name. Its herb is exceedingly potent and bitter as well.

Mirabilite (*mángxiàn*, 芒硝) is also bitter and pungent. Thus, when it is used in this manner, it is said to also possess potency. However, it can be employed in medicinal preparations for the sovereign, yet it is not suitable for alchemical transformations.

Some may doubt whether *kǔshuǐ* (苦水, bitter water) refers to vinegar, and why it must be so. If one seeks to perform alchemical transformations, it is not possible to refine *pǔmirabilite* (朴硝) and produce the essence of *yuánzhèng* (元正, primordial purity) without it. True substances are far superior in efficacy.

**Method for *Shípí* Mirabilite (石脾硝石法)**
Take *shípí* (石脾, *Shípí*) one *jīn* (斤), mirabilite (*mángxiàn*) one *jīn*, and *pǔmirabilite* one *jīn*.
Though this method is already recorded in the *Shíyàn* (硝石, Mirabilite) Essentials, it is transcribed again here for clarity. The previous volume distinguished true from false substances and included various methods, but in selecting one, errors may occur. Now, *mángxiàn* (芒硝), *róngyàn* (戎盥), and *shípí* (石脾) are all compounded together.

Master Pēng (彭君) further states that their transformative efficacy does not fall short of the genuine essence. He also instructs those seeking immortality to rely upon this method. Thus, the method for *shípí* is appended here.

Grind each substance finely and mix into a powder. Take three *dǒu* (斗) of *kǔshuǐ* (苦水, bitter water), and decoct in a copper pot until ten ebullitions occur. Add the three powders, and decoct until half the liquid remains. Remove the dregs and clarify the mixture. When the decoction reaches a viscous state, pour it into a porcelain vessel and immerse it in a clean porcelain vessel filled with *língshuǐ* (玲水, clear water) for one day—it will congeal into *shípí* mirabilite, resembling frost or frozen dew.

Pour water upon it, and it dissolves instantly. Then decoct again, until it reaches a viscous state, and pour it into a porcelain vessel, immersing it once more in *língshuǐ*. It will again form *shípí* mirabilite. Repeat this process three times. If the method is followed correctly, the results will be evident.

Do not refine it in a filthy place, nor expose it to wind or sunlight. *Shípí* is the congealed *qi* (氣) of yin and yang. The essence of the Five *Yàn* (盥) is prolonged by alum (*fán*, 矾) and nurtured by stone, often found in abundance on *Éyuè* Mountain (峨崛山). Common folk rarely recognize its use, so it is seldom sought. Only those who practice the Dao (道) must employ it.

In the past, it was divided into four regions, and none could obtain it. Thus, ancient alchemists created substitutes, which are indeed superior to the genuine substance. *Shípí* is the congealed *qi* of yin and yang. Bitter water is exceedingly potent, and alum is cold in nature; when these two are decocted together, they congeal under fire. The essence of the Five *Yàn* is derived from *rónglíng* (戎灵, *Rónglíng*), which can be used to make five-colored salt. The sovereign’s method is thus established.

Prolonged by alum and nurtured by stone, it becomes *báifánshí* (白矾石, white alum stone). This is its perfected form.

**Essentials of the *Jiǔdǐng* Divine Elixir (黄帝九鼎神丹经诀) – Volume XVI**

**Method for *Xuányellow* (玄黄, *Xuányellow*)**
*Xuányellow* is produced by mixing tin (*xí*, 锡) with mercury (*shuǐyín*, 水银).

Tin is originally derived from *Huángdān* (黄丹, yellow cinnabar), but if its essence is not refined, it is unfit for the cultivation of longevity. Thus, the method for *Huángdān* follows:

**Method for *Huángdān* (黄丹, yellow cinnabar)**
If one obtains *Huángdān* from the market, it may be adulterated with yellow soil, so its quality is uncertain. True *Huángdān* is not self-made by the master. The self-made elixir is red and vivid, with a lustrous radiance that is pleasing to the eye. If it does not meet this standard, it is not genuine.

**Preparation Method**
Take two *jīn* of lead (*qiān*, 铅), wash it clean in any quantity, and roast it in an iron cup until it becomes sandy. Rinse with clean water and place it in an iron sieve, repeatedly washing and sifting until it is thoroughly refined. Drain the water, leaving only the dregs, and dry them in the sun for ten days. Pound into a fine powder, then sift through silk. Place the powder back into the iron cup and roast it for two to three nights until it turns red. This is the refined lead (*dānqiān*, 丹铅).

**Extraction of Lead**
Hu Jiāngzǐ (狐刚子) says: In all elixir preparations, lead is the foundation. If the lead is not genuine, the elixir will fail. The method for extracting lead is as follows: Take *Xuányellow* essence (*jīngzhī*, 精汁) and add a small amount of gold powder (*jīnzéi*, 金贼). Knead it like dough until it is malleable, then dry it in the shade for seven to eight days. Heat it in an iron pot, and it becomes *dānqiān* (丹铅, cinnabar lead), which is then used to make *Xuányellow*.

The lead used for decocting mercury has a separate method, which is detailed under the *Fùshuǐyín* (伏汞, subdued mercury) and *shuǐyín* (水银, mercury) methods.

**Method for *Xuányellow* (玄黄)**
Take one *jīn* of mercury (*shuǐyín*), and decoct it for thirty-six days, or until it congeals with twenty *jīn* of lead. Refine it five times to ensure purity. Place both substances in an iron vessel and heat them fiercely. The lead and mercury will emit their refined essence—a violet substance with yellow brilliance, known as *Huángyá* (黄芽, yellow sprout) or *Lóngqīngfēi jīng* (龙轻飞精, Dragon’s Lightly Ascending Essence).

**Essentials Say:**
Take tin (*xí*) and place it in an iron vessel. Add charcoal fire beneath, and bring it to a boil. Gradually reduce the heat until it simmers, then add mercury (*shuǐyín*) into the vessel. Stir with damp willow wood until five colors appear. Use an iron spoon to skim near one side, then collect the essence, allowing it to flow out before taking it again.

When the fire is hot, the color appears yellow. If the fire is refined (*líng*, 玲), the color turns violet-green, with a faint vapor. If the fire is well-regulated, the color becomes red-violet, resembling gold.

When burned together in shared flame, they assume a single hue, closely resembling gold in form.
Once removed from the fire, they revert to their original nature.

To forge the *Danfǔ* (elixir cauldron), one must first prepare *Xuánhuáng* (玄黄, Mysterious Yellow).
The Nine Cauldrons’ ritual offerings likewise rely upon this substance.
If not pre-prepared in abundance, one will inevitably fall short when the moment arises.
Thus, one must early refine mercury and extract lead.

According to the *Tàiqīng* (太清, Supreme Clarity) ritual offering method, there are also instances where *Xuánbái* (玄白, Mysterious White) must be used as the elixir’s offering. The method follows as below:

---
**Method for *Xuánbái* (Mysterious White):**
In the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎, Nine Cauldrons) Eighth Elixir Method, take one *catty* of *Xuánhuáng* or *Xuánbái*, spread it across the cauldron’s base, and place mercury upon it—hence the necessity of its preparation.

Take lead, melt it into a flat plate, and place it beneath mercury—one *catty* of mercury to three *caties* of lead, with six *liǎng* of true gold, dissolving the lead and gold.
Then, introduce the mercury, beating it into a silver plate, and suspend it in the *Huápó* (华池, Flower Pool) for seven days, checking daily.
If no reaction occurs, seal the *Huápó*’s ceramic mouth tightly. When it reacts, collect the flowing white substance, place it in a green bamboo tube, seal its mouth with lacquer, and return it to the *Huápó*. After thirty days, it becomes water.

**Alternative Method:**
Take one *catty* of lead and one *catty* of gold, hammering them into a thin plate like silk.
Place it in a wooden tray, lining the bottom with cloth, and immerse it in the mixture. After thirty days, *Xuánbái* will form in the tray—only then may it be used.
If the *Xuánbái* contains gold, it may be used; if not, it cannot.

The *Tàiqīng* elixir uses *Xuánbái* as the offering gold, while the *Jiǔdǐng* method employs only *Xuánhuáng*.

**Note by the Scholar:**
To concoct the divine elixir, one must first prepare the various waters, refine all mineral poisons, submerge in *Liùyīní* (六一泥, Six-to-One Mud), and boil the subdued mercury. Whatever one handles must be steeped in vinegar for over a hundred days—this is called *chúnyùn* (淳酝, refined ferment). If aged three years or more, it is termed *kǔjiǔ* (苦酒, bitter wine). When medicated, it becomes the *Huápó*.
Ancients kept this secret, calling it the *zuǒwèi* (左味, Left Flavor), seeking the Great Dao.
Those who covet immortality and eternal youth must prepare it; without it, success is rare—hence the prescribed order follows.

---
**Method for Vinegar:**
Take one *dàn* of red *jì* millet, clean and rinsed, and three *dàn* of *bēn* (坩, a type of clay pot).
Cook it thoroughly into rice, then treat it in equal measure—three *dàn* at a time—placing it in a ceramic vessel, sifting and pressing it.
Mix the milled millet rice and *bēn* in equal parts, then layer seven sheets of paper over the ceramic mouth. After each seven days, remove one layer. By the forty-ninth day, all paper is gone.
Initially, the paper is sealed with *Zī* (Zl ］) cords.
After seven cycles of seven days, the vinegar is ready.
Cover the ceramic mouth with fine silk, waiting until full before adding medicine.
To extract the vinegar for medication, collect only the clear liquid.
If the dregs are to be stored, keep them sealed and undisturbed.

The vinegar water should be made with rainwater from the fifth month—most potent.
For large batches (hundreds or thousands of *dàn*), distribute the vinegar evenly across the ceramic base, ensuring it is spread thinly.

**Avoid frequent transfers—each move risks spoilage. Use only a wooden ladle, and occasionally sprinkle with dried thorns to remove hair and impurities.**

---
**From the *Tàiqīng Zhōngjīng* (太清中经, Supreme Clarity Central Scripture) – Method for the *Huápó*:**
The *Huápó* (Flower Pool) is also called *nìshuǐ* (溺水, Urine Water), *Sìhǎishuǐmǔ* (四海水母, Mother of the Four Seas), or *Xuánchí* (玄池, Mysterious Pool).
It exists naturally in the heavens, located at the North Pole.
The human-made method uses five *dàn* of refined *zuǒwèi*, taking three parts and adding one *catty* of honey, five *dòu* of grain.
Soak it in water until sprouted, then dry and sift it, placing it in the *Huápó* and mixing thoroughly.
Wrap thirty *catty* of alum stone in rice husks, soak it within, and seal it for three days—its taste is bitter yet sweet and sour.
Add ten *catty* of saltpeter, completing the mixture.

With five *dàn* of gold and jade water, twenty days of lead and mercury, or a hundred days of gold, silver, pearls, and lead, all will dissolve into water.
Rainwater from heaven used for *zuǒwèi* is especially superior.

**Heavenly Master’s *Tàiqīng Huápó* Oral Instruction:**
As per the original scripture, prepare the *Huápó* by soaking five *dòu* of grain in water until sprouted, drying and sifting it, then placing it in the *Huápó* and mixing with the other ingredients to complete it.
If the grain does not sprout, the pool will fail—this is the essence of the Great Dao.

With *Huápó* water, gold, jade, five stones, lead, and the like, all will dissolve into essence.
Among the thirty-six waters, all require the *Huápó* to transform into water.

---
**Method for Three-Cycle *Huángbái Zuǒwèi* (黄白左味, Yellow-White Left Flavor):**
Take six *dàn* of three-year-aged *kǔjiǔ* (bitter wine) from a refined fermentation.
Add spring wine dregs, stirring and mixing them in.
Take one *dàn* of *shǔmǐ* (黍米, glutinous millet), soak it thoroughly in urine water, and place it inside until fully dissolved. Press out the clear liquid.
Add eight *dòu* of *huángyī* (黄衣, yellow garment—likely fermented grain husks) and five kinds of sprouted grains—each three *dòu*—into the mixture. After twenty-one days, press it out and place it in a large ceramic vessel.
Add one *catty* each of gold and silver filings, two *catty* of green alum stone, ten *catty* of yellow alum stone, and three *catty* of thirty-times refined lead ash, wrapping them in cloth and suspending them within. After seventy days, the lead essence will dissolve into the medicine.

The completed *Huángbái Zuǒwèi* is another name for the *Huápó*—it exists naturally in the heavens.
The five sprouted grains refer to wheat, beans, millet, barley, and rice, soaked in water until sprouted in seven to eight days, forming a bed—collectively called the five sprouted grains.

If one seeks to concoct elixirs or refine gold and mercury waters, subduing the eight poisons and myriad celestial prescriptions, one must pre-prepare ten or twenty ceramic jars. These must be made in advance—never at the last moment, for the medicine will lack potency, and transformations will fail.

**Instruction:**
The *qīngfánshí* (青矾石, green alum stone) is selected from *hàobái fán* (昊白矾, celestial white alum), choosing only the green-yellow variety—this is what the *Běncǎo* (本草, *Compendium of Materia Medica*) calls *yīngyǐfán* (鹦矢矾, parrot-dropping alum).

「Hang it in the midst [of the mixture], after seventy days, the essence of lead will dissolve into the medicine, forming the yellow-white *zuǒwèi*—the method is complete. When the yellow-white *zuǒwèi* is achieved, this is called *Huápí*—it exists naturally in the heavens. The five sprouted grains refer to wheat, beans, millet, barley, and rice, soaked in water until sprouted, then selected and steamed until ripe. The *bùpò mài* (不破麦, unsprouted barley) is used to make the *zuǒwèi*—this is the correct method.

According to the *Húzǐ Xuánzhū Jīng* (狐子玄珠经, *Fox’s Mystic Pearl Scripture*), only the *Xuánzhū* (玄珠, Mystic Pearl) of the yellow-white *zuǒwèi* is employed, which is precisely the *Huápí* described above. All other methods are inferior to this.

The **Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir *Huápí* Method** (黄帝九鼎神丹华池方):
To concoct the *Huápí* elixir and verify the essence of the five stones, preventing their dispersion, take small barley (*xiǎomài*) five *dǒu* (斗, a measure of grain). Soak it, select the sprouted portion, and steam it until ripe. Take *gòu* (够, glutinous rice) five *dǒu*, and green-white stones (*qīngbái shí*) as large as a chestnut, five *dǒu* in total. Take seven *jīn* (斤, a unit of weight) of lead (*qiān*), and refine it into flakes (*xiè*). Take five *jīn* of cinnabar (*dānshā*), finely ground into powder. Take red millet rice (*chìshǔ mǐ*), one *dǒu* as the main ingredient, and cook it into porridge (*fàn*).

First, place the stones (*shízǐ*) at the bottom of the ceramic jar (*cípǐ*). Next, layer the cinnabar (*dānshā*), then the glutinous rice (*gòu*), followed by the barley (*mài*), then the millet porridge (*shǔfàn*), and finally, pour in one *shí* (石, a large measure) and five *dǒu* of water, thoroughly moistening it. Seal the jar tightly. In summer, it takes seventy days to complete; in winter, one hundred and forty days.

Prepare it in a secluded chamber (*shèngshì*), at a auspicious location (*wàngxiàng zhī dì*), ensuring that no parrot (*yīng*), dogs (*quǎn*), women (*fùrén*), or livestock (*liùchù*) witness the process, lest the divine efficacy (*shén gōng*) fail.

The **Jade Candle Five Sprouted Grains *Huápí* Method for Subduing Mercury** (玉烛万金诀伏汞华池方):
Take three *shí* of yellow-white *zuǒwèi*, along with one *jīn* of celestial green alum (*hàoqīng fán*), and one *jīn* each of the five sprouted grains. Take the yellow-white *zuǒwèi* and refine it three times (*sān zhuǎn*), then finely grind it.

Take *qīngshān zhī* (青山脂, green mountain fat), and store it for seven days before opening the seal. Add the five sprouted grains, reseal tightly to prevent leakage, and let it mature in three cycles of seven days (*sān qī rì*), thus completing the process.

According to the *Dān Huápí* (单华池, Single *Huápí*) method, if one seeks to subdue mercury (*fú gōng*), the essential requirement is to use the five sprouted grains *Huápí* method. Any other method will fail to subdue mercury. Common folk, unaware of this, simply boil it in vinegar (*cù*), either for three nights or ten days and ten nights, expending their efforts in vain—there will be no true subduction. Without the five sprouted grains *Huápí*, even if one labors for a thousand days, success will never be achieved.

**Instruction:** This method of the five sprouted grains *Huápí* is made using the yellow-white *zuǒwèi*, clarifying that it is not the vinegar-refined *zuǒwèi*. Moreover, according to the *Xuánzhū* (玄珠) method, all substances refined (*zhì*) are said to be of the yellow-white *zuǒwèi*. Now, using the refined flakes (*jīn xiè*) of this *Xuánzhū*—gold flakes (*jīn xiè*), silver flakes (*yín xiè*), and lead white (*qiān bái*)—along with green-yellow stones (*qīnghuáng èr pān*) of the great *Huápí*, and on days *gēngxīn dǎo* (庚辛卯, the 7th, 8th, and 4th day of the lunar cycle), re-add the five sprouted grains and celestial green alum (*hàoqīng fán*), and let it mature in four cycles of seven days (*sì qī rì*). Then use it to subdue mercury—it will always be effective.

The variations in methods are initially perplexing, but this ensures no mistakes are made. As for the Jade Candle Five Sprouted Grains *Huápí* method, it involves refining the yellow-white *zuǒwèi* three times (*sān zhuǎn*), which is precisely what is described here.

Why? Because the initial method of three refinements of the yellow-white *zuǒwèi* uses six *shí* of aged, bitter wine (*kǔjiǔ*), which has been repeatedly distilled (*chóngniàng*) from three-year-old wine. This is the meaning of the first refinement (*yī zhuǎn*). The term *chóngniàng* (重酿) refers to another name for *chúnzuì* (淳醉, pure intoxicant), as its flavor is not diluted. It is not the common, profit-seeking wine (*súwèn qiú lì zhī wèi*).

Again, it states: Take the pure essence (*shàngqīng*) of the second refinement (*èr zhuǎn*), along with one *shí* of spring wine dregs (*chūnjiǔ zāo*), and thoroughly mix it in after it has been stored for a period. Then take one *shí* of the finest millet rice (*shàngshǔ mǐ*), cook it into a weak, extremely soft porridge (*ruò chī jí làn*), and add it to the mixture, waiting until it fully dissolves. This is the meaning of the second refinement (*èr zhuǎn*).

Again, it states: Take this second refinement (*èr zhuǎn*), then press it to extract the pure essence (*qīng*). Add eight *dǒu* of yellow-white *zuǒwèi*, and three *dǒu* each of the five sprouted grains. Store it in a sealed jar for three cycles of seven days (*sān qī rì*), then press it out and place it in a large ceramic jar (*dà cípǐ*). Add one *jīn* each of gold flakes (*jīn xiè*) and silver flakes (*yín xiè*), followed by two *jīn* of celestial green alum (*hàoqīng fán*), ten *jīn* of yellow alum (*huáng fán*), and three *jīn* of fifty-times refined lead white flakes (*wǔshí liàn qiān bái xiè*). Wrap it in cloth and suspend it within the jar. After seventy days, the essence of lead will dissolve into the medicine, forming the yellow-white *zuǒwèi*—this is the meaning of the third refinement (*sān zhuǎn*).

Now, using the third refinement of yellow-white *zuǒwèi*, after the essence of lead has fully dissolved, and the seventy-day process is complete, take one *shí* of the pure essence (*shàngqīng*) and add one *jīn* of finely ground celestial green alum (*hàoqīng fán*), storing it for seven days before opening the seal. Then add one *jīn* each of the five sprouted grains, reseal tightly to prevent leakage, and let it mature in three cycles of seven days (*sān qī rì*), thus completing the process.

This is what is referred to as "reapplying celestial green alum and reinvesting the five sprouted grains," done to ensure its supreme efficacy. Therefore, the *Dān Huápí* (单华池) method, even if practiced for a thousand days without proper observance, will never succeed.

The **Jade Candle Five Sprouted Grains *Huápí*** (玉烛五栽) is also called the *Huápí Xuánzhū* (华池玄珠, *Huápí* Mystic Pearl). The method for subduing mercury (*fú gōng*) is only called *zuǒwèi*, clarifying that it must be refined to the fifth sprouted grain and fourth transformation (*wǔ zǎi sì zhuǎn*) to be the true method.

Again, according to the annotations of the **Yellow Emperor’s Supreme Unity Gold Elixir Returning Elixir *Huápí* Method** (太一金液还丹注释), all failures are due to either the use of false saltpeter (*xiāo shí*), or the *Huápí* method being lost. This is the case.

Again, regarding the **Five Transformations Frost Powder *Huápí* Method** (五转霜粉法之华池), if not done as prescribed, even after ten days or twenty days, or even if one adds hooks and leaves (*gōuliú*), the pills will never form properly. If mixing clay with aged, bitter wine (*kǔjiǔ*), it can also be done according to the gold elixir *zuǒwèi* method, but the wine must not be rushed—it must be aged. The term *bǎi rì* (百日) means it must not be less than one hundred days; three years is even better.

The **Yellow Emperor’s Supreme Unity Gold Elixir Returning Elixir *Huápí* Method** (黄帝太一金液还丹华池方):
Take three *shí* and six *dǒu* of water from the heavens during the fifth month (*tiān yǔ shuǐ*), and make aged, bitter wine (*kǔjiǔ*), using glutinous rice (*mǐ gòu*) as usual for sealing the jar. Within twenty-one days, prepare one *dǒu* and eight *shēng* (升, a smaller measure) of finely ground barley sprout powder (*dàmài xuàn mò luò*).

After seven days, or three cycles of seven days (*sān qī rì*), separate the clear liquid (*qīngdèng*) and store it in a large ceramic jar (*dà cípǐ*), naming it *zuǒwèi*. Again, prepare three *dǒu* of finely ground glutinous rice (*lín mǐ luò*), and first grind ten *jīn* of alum stone (*fán shí*) until it resembles the size of glutinous rice grains (*rú mǐdòu dà*). Wrap the grinded alum in the glutinous rice powder, making about thirty such parcels (*bāo*). Place them in the *zuǒwèi*, and after one hundred days, it becomes the **Yellow Emperor’s Supreme Unity *Huápí*** (太一华池).

Once the *Huápí* is complete, it can be used to soak gold elixir (*jīn yè*), and as a remedy for the eight stones (*bā shí*). The **Eight Stones *Huápí* Method** (八石华池法):
Take two *shí* and one *dǒu* of the third refinement *zuǒwèi*, along with one *jīn* each of purple stone crystal (*zǐ shíyīng*), true stalactite (*zhēn zhōnglǘ*), and special-born *yù shí* (誉石, esteemed stone), one *jīn* of magnetite (*cí shí*), five *jīn* of *qīngyáng shí* (青阳石, green sun stone), one *jīn* and four *liǎng* (两, ounce) of gypsum (*shí gāo*), and eight *liǎng* of *shízhēng zhī* (石亭脂, stone pavilion fat), along with three *dǒu* of the five sprouted grains.

In all cases of the Nine Elixirs, sift the *tāo* (梼) separately, select a day of the *Yin* (寅), and combine them in porcelain vessels, sealing tightly so as not to let the *qi* escape. In seven days, it is complete.

Take gold filings, silver filings, and *huáng yī* (黄衣) and cast them into the Eight Stones *Huápí*. According to the method, when full, it becomes the Yellow-White *Zuǒwèi*. This is the Yellow-White Eight Stones *Huápí*. With this *Zuǒwèi*, one may boil mercury and refine cinnabar (*hédān*), and upon sublimation, it yields the elixir of immortality.

**Qīngshān Zhī *Huápí* Method**
Take two *shí* and one *dǒu* of the third refinement *Zuǒwèi*, that which is the color of amber. Within it, use fifty *jīn* of *Hàoqīngshān zhī* (昊青山脂, Celestial Blue Mountain Fat)—some say thirty *jīn*—sifted and cast into the *Zuǒwèi*, sealed tightly so as not to let the *qi* escape. In forty-nine days, it becomes the Eight Treasures *Qībǎo Water*. Add five *dǒu* of the Seven Treasures, reseal for three times seven days, and place the medicine inside without omission—it will no longer be water. Keep this secret and do not divulge it.

Adding earthly filings of Yellow-White and the like, it transforms into water and elixir with certainty.

**Chūncháo *Huápí***
Take three *shí* of the seventh refinement *Chūncháo*, that which is perfectly black. Within it, use three *dǒu* of Five Mountains Fat (*Wǔshān zhī*), five *jīn* each of *mángxiāo* (芒硝, mirabilite) and *pǔxiāo* (朴硝, crude saltpeter), each sifted separately, and cast into the *Chūncháo*. Seal for three times seven days, and it is complete.

For all transformations and refinements of Yellow-White, or altering the Five Metals, this *Huápí* is used—most secret, worth ten thousand in gold.

The supreme *Huápí* is used to make the *Bǎiqīshuǐ* (百七水, Hundred-Seven Water). All cases of subduing mercury use the Yellow-White *Zuǒwèi*, and one must use gold filings, silver filings, and the like, cast into the *Chūnniàng Huápí* (春酿华池, Spring Ferment *Huápí*) to refine the divine *fēiqiānshuǐ* (飞铅汞, sublimated lead-mercury water).

For all uses of the Thirty-Six Waters, and for all nitrates used in transformations, take the *Huápí* of the Yellow Emperor’s Supreme Golden Elixir (*Tàiyī Jīnyè Huápí*), the *Huápí* of the *Tàiqīng Zhōngjīng* (太清中经, Central Scripture of Supreme Clarity) Divine Elixir, or the *Huápí* of the *Yùshuǐ* (溺水, Urine Water) as well.

If boiling the elixir of immortality’s mercury, use the Eight Stones Five Refined Yellow-White Third Refinement *Zuǒwèi Huápí*.

If one wishes to mix *mòjīnní* (没金泥, gold-sealing mud), take wine aged three years or one hundred days.

The **Jīnhuá Huápí** (金华华池, Golden Flower *Huápí*), akin to the Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir (*Jiǔdǐng Shéndān*), is used in blending, refining, and coating—all applications. Other *Huápí* methods that do not align with this are not recorded here.

**End of Volume Seventeen of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Scripture**
**End of Volume Eighteen of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Scripture**

The **Lingzhu (钟乳)** and other stones, as well as all copper and iron ores, all possess the use of prolonging life.

**Refining Lingzhu’s Power**
The humble servant notes: Though Lingzhu is not the finest of medicines, it is indeed the essential ingredient for the *Eight Stones Huápí*. Thus, Tao Yuanming (陶隐居) consumed it, thereby extending his lifespan, preserving his youthful vigor, and maintaining his radiant complexion without aging.

**Lingzhu’s Therapeutic Actions**
The humble servant notes: Lingzhu is of sweet and warm nature, non-toxic, and treats:
- Reversed drinking (饮逆),
- Upper respiratory obstruction (上气),
- Brightening the eyes and enhancing essence (明目益精),
- Calming the five viscera (安五脏),
- Unifying the hundred joints (通百节),
- Benefiting the nine orifices (利九窍),
- Promoting lactation (下乳汁),
- Augmenting *qi* and replenishing deficiencies (益气补虚损),
- Treating leg weakness, pain, and numbness (疼玲),
- Rectifying injuries from sexual exhaustion (下宜伤竭),
- Strengthening yang (强阳),
- Conferring fertility (令人有子).

If consumed unrefined, it causes urinary disorders (淋). *Shechuang* (蛇床) serves as its messenger herb, while it is antagonized by *mudan* (牡丹), *xuanshi* (玄石), and *du rong* (杜荣), and feared by *zishí* (紫石) and *suocao* (蓑草).

**Lingzhu’s Sources**
The humble servant notes: Lingzhu grows in the valleys of Shaoshi Mountain (少室山) and Taishan (太山). It may be harvested at any time. It is also known as *Kongru* (孔乳), *Lushi* (卢石), and *Xiashi* (夏石), found in Shaoshi, which connects to Songshan (嵩高山). It also appears in regions like Shixing (始兴), Jiangling (江陵), and the eastern frontier’s renowned mountains and stone caves. The finest Lingzhu is light and thin like a goose quill, shatters like claws or nails, lacks internal striations like wild goose teeth (*yanzhi*), and gleams brightly. Some specimens reach one to two *chi* in length, turning white when washed with aged wine. Though rarely used in Daoist scriptures, it is highly valued in folk prescriptions and commands a high price.

**Refining Lingzhu into the Elixir of Longevity (长生华池法)**

Take Lingzhu, regardless of quantity or thickness—only that which has been washed until its brightness gleams—may be used for refining.
The yellow and red hues are unfit for use.

When refining, place the Lingzhu in a vessel of gold or silver. If no such vessel is available, a large cauldron may suffice. Boil it until the liquid is as viscous as fish eyes, then add water as it evaporates.
For thin specimens, three days and nights suffice. If black-edged or thick like a goose quill, seven days and nights are needed. When the liquid turns yellow, the Lingzhu is ripe. If doubt remains, boil for ten days and nights; the water in the cauldron will turn entirely yellow.
Discard all this water. Drinking it will perforate the throat and cause headaches. Prolonged consumption leads to dysentery, but eating pork may remedy it. If the yellow water is not discarded, the process will fail. Pour in fresh water and boil the Lingzhu again for half a day. If the water remains clear, refining is complete.

If refining is careless and the elixir is consumed, it will cause festering sores on the back. Thus, meticulous refining is essential.

**Method for Grinding the Refined Lingzhu**
Place the refined Lingzhu in a porcelain mortar and grind it with a jade pestle until it shatters. Add a little water during grinding; as the water evaporates, replenish it, always keeping the mixture as thin as diluted ink. The finer particles will float, while the coarse ones settle. Though grinding with a pestle may seem swift, it must be done continuously for five or six days, day and night. Grind it so finely that it resembles human milk. After ten days, the Lingzhu will emit a pure white radiance, most exquisite.
Test a small amount by applying it to your arm—it will adhere like white fish fat on paper, glowing with light even when washed. Only such refined Lingzhu is worthy of consumption.

After thorough refining, strain and dry it in the sun. Once fully ground into fine powder, it may be used in pills or powders as needed.

**Alternative Method:**
To obtain superior Lingzhu, sift it through silk and soak the residue in clear wine for a day and night. Remove the floating impurities, then take the settled portion, dry it, and grind it as before.

Once the Lingzhu is fully refined and ground into powder, mix it with three *dan* of glutinous rice and steam it for optimal effect.

**Another Method:**
After grinding and refining the Lingzhu, place it in a gold or silver basin. For every *jin* of Lingzhu, use two *liang* of saltpeter (硝石), mix them well, and seal tightly to prevent the escape of *qi*. Then steam the mixture.

**Zishíyīng (紫石英)**
The humble servant notes: Zishíyīng is the finest powder of Lingzhu. Consuming it ensures longevity, and holding it in the mouth prevents hunger and thirst.

Zishíyīng is the essential ingredient of the *Bashi* (八石) elixir. Long-term consumption lightens the body and extends life. Its taste is sweet, spicy, and warm, with no toxicity. It grows in the valleys of Taishan (太山). It may be harvested at any time.

The stones from Taishan are of black color, clear and bright. Beneath them lies a root, hence they are called the finest.

There is also *Mian* stone (绵石), which is black but not clear and bright. Another is *Caiyi* stone (材邑石), whose belly encloses something resembling an eye. *Hao* stone (昊兴石) has purple hues on its four edges but lacks luster. *Hui* stone (会稽石) resembles pomegranate seeds in shape and color.

These four kinds of stones were once indiscriminately used by physicians. Now, if one selects the finest, none surpasses Taishan’s rooted stone. It may be added to the *Bashí* (八石) elixir.

**Dai* **Zhe* Stone (代赭石) – One *Dou* (斗):**
The humble servant notes: Dai Zhe is especially crucial for Daoist elixirs. It is also urgently needed alongside *Rong* salt (戎盥) and *Lu* salt (卤咸). Thus, it is a vital ingredient in the Yellow Emperor’s elixirs.

The finest has a vermilion-red hue, like a rooster’s comb, with luster—it stains fingernails without fading. Commonly sourced from the valleys of Qi (齐国), it may be harvested at any time. Also called *Xu* Pill (须丸), from Gumu (姑幕), or *Xu* Pill Strength (须丸力) from Dai (代郡), named Dai Zhe. This is the common usage, but it is coarse.

Its taste is bitter-sweet, cool, and non-toxic.

**Lu* Salt (卤咸):**
The humble servant notes: Lu* salt and *Rong* salt? These are the most prized by elixir artisans. They are also essential ingredients in the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons (九鼎) elixir.

Their taste is bitter, salty, and cool, with no toxicity. They grow in the salt pools of the He* River (河束). Some say they are the congealed residue beneath boiling salt cauldrons, while others claim they are the great spirit of the He* River, forming like frozen ice, round and firm.

*Hei* salt (黑盥) is likely Lu* salt, and *Rou* salt (柔盥) is probably *Rong* salt. There is also red salt (赤盐), spotted salt (驳臭盐), and *Ma* salt (马齿盐). All four are not fit for consumption; *Ma* salt is the same as *Da* salt (大盥).

**Rong* Salt (戎盥):**
The humble servant notes: *Rong* salt is abundant among the barbarians. When the chieftain from Dong* State (冻州) arrives, the salt he carries is likely this inferior grade. The chieftain from Henan (河南), as well as the Hu* merchants from Dun*huang (炖煌), also bring it.

Its form is in blocks or slices, sometimes like chicken or duck eggs, sometimes like ice flakes. Its color is purple-white, and though its saltiness is unbearable, when tasted, it emits a faint vapor—just like the scent of a *Duan* chicken egg—proving its authenticity. Additionally, within the mud of Lingchi Pool (灵池) in Henan, there naturally exists congealed salt resembling stone flakes. When struck, it breaks into squares of green color, effectively treating horseback sores. This is likely the same as well.

In general, since it is called *Rong*, one should obtain it from Hu* merchants for the best quality.

**To the Right:** Zishíyīng (紫石英), Dai Zhe (代赭), Lu* salt (卤咸), and *Rong* salt (戎盥) are all non-toxic substances used by elixir artisans. As for Lu* salt, once refined by fire, its method is already established. The rest, even if not refined, may still be used without concern.

**Lead* **Cinnabar (铅丹):**
The humble servant notes: Lead cinnabar is born from lead—it is made by smelting and refining lead into yellow cinnabar. Common folk rarely use it, except in the Daoist *Jian* elixir cauldron, where it is refined to become Nine Radiant (九光) elixir.

This is the method for the Nine Radiant elixir. No other changes or refinements are needed. Also called *Qiang* Flower (铅华).

Its taste is spicy and slightly cool; long-term consumption grants divine insight.

**Hu* Powder (胡粉):**
The humble servant notes: Hu* powder is the primary substance for the True Person’s Ninefold Refined Lead Cinnabar (九转铅丹). It is also the first ingredient in the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons (九鼎) Divine Elixir method, where it is mixed with *Xuan* Yellow Flower (玄黄花) to form a paste. It is indeed of utmost importance.

However, *Bencao* (本草) states: Powdered tin is also called *Jie* Powder (解粉). It further explains: This is the result of refining lead into gold, producing Hu* powder. Its taste is spicy and cool, non-toxic, and those with a golden hue are superior.

**Method to Neutralize Lead Poison:**
From the first to the ninth refinement, the process is the same. Use one *Dou* (斗) of fine spring flower pool (好春华池), one *Liang* (两) of red salt (赤盥), and one *Liang* of vermilion (朱砂). Stir and immerse them thoroughly. Refine the lead thoroughly by frying it until it turns red, then strain it into the spring flower pool medicine. Repeat this nine times—its poison will be fully exhausted.

One *Dou* of spring flower pool and two *Liang* of red salt cannot neutralize one *Jin* (斤) of lead’s poison, so the poison will not be fully exhausted.

**Method to Remove Copper’s Impurities:**
First, pound it into thin sheets. Apply warm glue juice until it is thin and pliable. Burn it in a *Yue* furnace (越宠) until it turns red, then seal it with thick *Ling* paste (灵厚). Place it back in the *Yue* furnace and burn until red, then remove it. Pound and wash it before placing it back in the furnace. Repeat this process twenty times. If done a hundred times, all impurities will be eliminated, and the copper will become soft and pure.

**Method to Remove *Shu* Stone (输石) and Iron’s Impurities:**
Removing impurities from *Shu* stone and iron is also similar to the copper method. Before pounding *Shu* stone and copper into thin sheets, they must first be pre-refined three times. Their bodies will then be more pliable, and their waters must be thoroughly strained, warmed, and not fully poured in, lest they scatter and be lost.

The *Shuo* (铄) method is as follows: Cut into pieces one *Cun* (寸) wide, six to seven *Cun* long, and two *Fen* (分) thick. After burning, pound and apply glue to fully coat them. If they become too hot, fold them; otherwise, they will not complete the hundred-fold process. Ten *Liang* of impure copper can yield five *Liang* or less of pure substance. This method applies similarly.

**Refining Stone Salt (石盐):**
Ten *Jin* (斤) of stone salt must be strained and washed. Boil it with hot water until it dissolves, then let it settle overnight. Take the clear liquid, evaporate it until nearly dry, and spread it out. Place it in wooden containers, drain the water, and dry it in the sun, ensuring no dust contaminates it.

The best stone salt is ground into three *Dou* of powder. Sift it with cold water and quickly strain it out; slow straining will cause it to dissolve.

Again, use water just enough to moisten it, then wait until it fully dissolves before straining. Let it settle overnight, take the clear liquid, and evaporate the water to obtain salt crystals. Place them in wooden containers, tilt the container to drain the water, and dry in the sun—this yields the finest product.

**Refining White Wax (白蜡) Method:**
Take fine white wax from Kunlun (昆仑). In a sweet clay pot, dissolve it by adding vinegar, refining it three hundred times to complete the process.

When mixed and boiled with medicines, it immediately stops hunger. It can also be used to create a longevity-enhancing skeletal structure, and its refining method for copper and other uses is the same.

**Method for Taking White Wax:**

Take three *jin* of narrow-mouthed jar (*狭斗*), two *sheng* of hemp (*胡麻*), and two *liang* of ginseng (*人参*), along with three *liang* of sulfur (*硫黄*). In total, these four substances are each ground into fine powder and formed into cold honey pills (*冷蜜丸*).

After eating, chew a large piece of white wax—about the size of a date—then add this medicine, chewing it like millet grains until it becomes watery. Swallow it immediately. Repeat this three times a day.

In thirty days, the body’s internal and external *qi* will harmonize, and the skin will become smooth and radiant. In a hundred days, one will appear transformed; in a year, the corpse will expel itself (*伏尸自去*), and all ailments will be cured—one will even revert to the appearance of a child.

**Method for Refining Tin (炼锡法):**
This is similar to the method for refining white wax above. The process is nearly identical.

In refining tin, for each *jin* of tin, add one *jin* of salt powder. Stir with damp willow branches until fully dissolved, then pour into a crucible. Repeat the refining process as before. If you wish to extract pure tin directly, pour it into damp earth. If you refine it ten times and obtain pure tin, you must still mix it with salt and refine again.

**Method for Refining Narrow-Long Fungus (炼狭苓法):**
Take the finest, purest white narrow-long fungus (*狭苓*), which is smooth and tender. Boil it in mulberry ash water until it disperses, then pour it into boiling water. It will quickly congeal into a firm, jar-like shape—this is the best form for use.

**Refining Yellow Earth (炼土扶):**
Take the finest yellow earth, which resembles fat or wax in texture. Dry it in the sun, then grind and sift it. Wash it with water as if preparing sweet wine (*甘饮*), stirring it hundreds of times. Let it settle overnight, then remove the upper clear water.

Take the remaining fine sediment, dry it in the sun. The lower layer is then ground and washed again as before.

Break it into pieces the size of plums or cherries, and burn it fiercely for one or two days until it turns uniformly red like cinnabar (*丹*). Let it cool, then grind it through silk sieves—three *jin* of the refined earth mixed with one *jin* of yellow cinnabar (*黄丹*)—this is the finished product.

Another method: Take one *jin* of yellow earth, which is dense and finely textured. Sift it through silk, then boil it in scalding water for three days. This sediment is used as the crude form of *Huangdi’s Nine Cauldron Elixir* (黄帝九鼎丹), specifically as the *Danliu Zhu Dan* (丹流珠丹).

**Method for Warding Off Evil Spirits and Pestilence (辟神虫皇法):**

Collect five *yǔshuǐ* (rainwater from the fifth month), store it in a porcelain vessel. When needed, reheat it—**pests will emerge and foul it**. To prevent this beforehand, take **three to five *dòu* of soft, yellow earth**, place it in the vessel, and seal it tightly—**do not let dust or impurities enter**.

**Method for Extracting Onion Tears (*cōng tì*):**
Pound fresh onions, wrap them in a coarse cloth, and press to extract the liquid—this is called *tì* (tears).

**Method for Refining Date Honey (*zǎo gāo*):**
Take **one *dòu* of dried dates**, add **six *dòu* of water**, and boil until the dates soften. Then add **three *dòu* of water**, boil again until scalding, and reduce the liquid to **nine *shāng* of decoction**. Strain out the dregs, clarify the liquid, and reduce it to **three *shāng**. Add **six *shāng* of ram’s (雄羊) fat**, stir gently, and simmer until it thickens like syrup. If ram’s fat is unavailable, **goat’s marrow** may substitute. Divide into grades—this is *zǎo gāo* (date honey).

**Such honey, when taken long-term, fills the body, bestowing radiant complexion.**

This honey is used in the preparation of **Golden Elixir (Jīnyè) and Elixir Refining**.

*Excerpt from the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir Canon, Volume Nineteen*

**Methods for Detoxifying Poisonous Metals and Minerals in Alchemical Preparation**

**Detoxifying Dan-Yang Copper Poison**
As recorded in the preceding volume, coat copper with salt glue a hundred times, refining it until pure. Then pulverize the refined copper and boil it in **one *dòu* of nitre water** until fully dissolved. Next, boil it in **one *dòu* of green vitriol water** until fully dissolved. Then boil it in **one *dòu* of *róngxǐ* water** until fully dissolved. Again, boil it in **one *dòu* of true wine**, along with ground black pepper, until fully dissolved. Finally, wrap **one *dàn* of glutinous red millet** around the copper shavings, mix evenly with ground black pepper, and combine with sugarcane juice. Steam for three days and nights, then remove. All poison shall be eliminated. This method detoxifies **ten *jīn* of Dan-Yang copper**, rendering it suitable for powdering and alchemical transformation.

**Detoxifying Lead Ore Poison**
Take the finest Persian lead ore of the highest quality. As in the preceding volume, refine it with salt glue a hundred times until pure. Pulverize the refined ore, then apply the same boiling and steaming methods as for Dan-Yang copper—no differences exist.

**Detoxifying Iron Filings Poison**
Refine iron filings with salt glue a hundred times, ensuring all foul vapors are exhausted. Take **ten *jīn* of refined iron filings**, pulverize them, and boil in the following solutions for three days and nights:
1. **Three *dòu* of realgar water**, until fully dissolved.
2. **One day and night** in *róngxǐ* water (prepared as specified).
3. **One day and night** in magnetite water: place **one *jīn* of iron** in a clean crucible, wrap evenly with cloth, and overlay with the powdered iron. Seal tightly, subject to intense fire beneath, then cool and collect the refined essence. Repeat with magnetite water for another day and night—all poison shall be eliminated. Only then may this detoxified iron be powdered or used in alchemical transformations.

**Preparation of Special Waters**
*(From the Thirty-Six Waters Canon)*

**Nitre Water Method**
Sift nitre, soak it in brine until thoroughly moistened, then place in a bamboo tube. Seal tightly and bury it **four *cùn* underground** for five days to yield the water. *(Note: Some texts specify four *chǐ* and four *cùn*—verify before use.)*

**Green Vitriol Water Method**
Select blue-green vitriol (**one *jīn***), first moistening it thoroughly with pure wine. Seal it with lacquer in a container, then bury it **three *chǐ* underground** for fifteen days to yield the water.

**Stone Sulfur Water Method**
Take **one *jīn* of stone sulfur**, **one *shāng* of mulberry leaf dew** (collected by a pure-hearted child on a clear morning with washed hands), and **two *liǎng* of nitre**. Seal in a lacquered bamboo tube and submerge in a flower-filled pond for thirty days to yield the water.

**Pure Brine Water Method**
*(This is brine water.)* Prepare refined salt, sift it, and moisten thoroughly with water. Hollow out a bamboo tube, wrap its mouth tightly with silk, then bury it **four *chǐ* and four *cùn* underground**—the water forms in four days.

**These four waters** are used for refining Dan-Yang copper and lead ore.

**Realgar Water Method**
Take **one *jīn* of realgar**, place it in a bamboo tube with **four *liǎng* of nitre**, seal with lacquer, and submerge in a flower-filled pond for thirty days. *(Alternatively, add two *liǎng* each of vitriol and nitre, seal in an earthen jar, and bury for twenty days.)* The resulting water is sweet-tasting and yellow.

**Brine Water** is the same as the **Pure Brine Water** method above, differing only in name.

**Magnetite Water Method**
Take **one *jīn* of magnetite**, **one *liǎng* of雄黄 (*rónghuáng*)**, and **one *liǎng* of stone gall**. Grind them together, seal in a lacquered bamboo tube, and submerge in a flower-filled pond for thirty days to yield the water. *(All sealed containers must be dried in shade with ash-wrapped cloth.)*

**These three waters** are used for detoxifying iron filings.

---
**General Alchemical Principles**
For those seeking to transmute **Divine Elixir (Shén Dān)** into gold or silver, all waters and minerals must be refined with utmost precision—especially copper and iron, which are not naturally occurring but artificially produced.

To transmute copper into gold or silver:
- For gold: Use **detoxified fire-refined copper**, then apply **雄黄 (*rónghuáng*)** to alter its hue before testing with the elixir.
- For silver: First treat copper with **detoxified white wax** (as in the preceding volume) to whiten it, then test with the elixir. Only through such meticulous preparation shall the transformation succeed—this is the mark of true divine medicine.

---
**Ritual Precautions for Elixir Preparation**
Before commencing elixir formulation in the mountains, first summon the mountain spirits to inquire for approval. Only then may the work proceed without flaw. The method is as follows:

1. **Purification and Invocation**
   - Fast for ten days. Write a **one-*chǐ* yellow-and-white talisman**, dedicating it to the mountain’s sovereign deity. Declare your intent to craft **Divine Elixir**, seeking their permission and ritual directives via symbolic characters.
   - On the day of elixir unification, write an **eight-*cùn* white talisman in cinnabar**, encase it in a crimson pouch, and strike it against your chest.
   - Those who ingest the elixir must abstain for seven days beforehand. Upon consumption, they shall attain **spiritual penetration**, able to command ghosts and spirits.

   *(This is the **Taiyi Eight-*cùn* White Talisman**.)* Preserve the talisman with reverence—do not defile it.

**Incantation from the *Taqīng Shén Dān Bǎo Jīng*:**
*"Concentrate and refine the eight stones,
Illumine with five radiances, seven clarities.
Secure the Celestial Treasury’s essence,
Subdue the Fire Spirits’ might.
Through nine transformations, achieve transcendence—
Ascend to the Supreme Clarity."*

After reciting the incantation, seal the talisman in a **green silk pouch** and strike it upon the head.

This talisman subdues and controls the stone *qi* (精), preventing its escape, filling the air with mist and frost, and causing the *shénhuá* (神华) to congeal. The **harm-repelling talisman**—written in cinnabar on white paper—three inches wide, four inches long—must be cast into the hearth. Immediately, the *qi* will be suppressed. If one often sees the divine light and refines the *qi*, all spirits will come and gather, and immortals with jade maidens will appear.

When the **spiritual elixir** is complete, no malevolent ghosts or spirits in heaven and earth can cause harm.

The method states: *"To forge the spiritual elixir of the five stones and their transformations, extracting the essence of the five metals, one must first pay homage to the **Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord** (天上皇道君) and receive the **Five Divine Talismans** (五神符). Then, the five stones and five metals will transform at will, and their essences will compete to emerge.*

**Green Dao/Way Lord Talisman Method** (青帝符法): On days *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙), use white millet grass as the mat, three feet long. Spread a green silk banner one *zhàng* (丈) two feet long upon it. Place two cups of wine and two slices of dried meat on the mat. Use the banner as the ground, and write the talisman in ink—two inches wide, seven inches long—and place it on the mat. The incantation reads:

*'On a fortunate day and auspicious hour,
Your humble servant [name] prostrates twice.
Reverently receiving the Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord’s Green Dao/Way Lord Divine Talisman.
After prostrating twice, burn the talisman and ingest it.*
This corresponds to one talisman image. When copying, ensure meticulous accuracy. The **Red Dao/Way Lord Talisman Method** (赤帝符法): On days *bǐng* (丙) and *dīng* (丁), use white millet grass as the mat, three feet long. Spread a crimson silk banner one *zhàng* three feet long upon it. Place two cups of wine and two slices of dried meat on the mat. Write the talisman in cinnabar—two inches wide, seven inches long—and cast it upon the mat. The incantation reads:

*'On a fortunate day and auspicious hour,
Your humble servant [name] prostrates twice.
Reverently receiving the Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord’s White Dao/Way Lord Divine Talisman.
After prostrating twice, burn the talisman and ingest it.'*

**Yellow Dao/Way Lord Talisman Method** (黄帝符法): On days *wù* (戊) and *jǐ* (己), use white millet grass as the mat, three feet long. Spread a yellow silk banner one *zhàng* two feet long upon the mat. Place two cups of wine and two slices of dried meat on the mat. Use vermilion as the ground, and write the talisman in purple ink—three inches wide, seven inches long—and cast it upon the mat. The incantation reads:

*'On a fortunate day and auspicious hour,
Your humble servant [name] prostrates twice.
Reverently receiving the Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord’s Yellow Dao/Way Lord Divine Talisman.
After prostrating twice, burn and ingest the talisman.'*

**The following talismans are not closely related to the previous five**, yet they are also counted as one talisman. Each must be examined carefully.

**White Dao/Way Lord Talisman Method** (白帝符法): On days *gēng* (庚) and *xīn* (辛), use white millet grass as the mat, three feet long. Spread a plain white silk banner one *zhàng* three feet long upon it. Place two cups of wine and two slices of dried meat on the mat. Use green as the ground, and write the talisman in cinnabar—two inches wide, seven inches long—and cast it upon the mat. The incantation reads:

*'On a fortunate day and auspicious hour,
Your humble servant [name] prostrates twice.
Reverently receiving the Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord’s White Dao/Way Lord Divine Talisman.
After prostrating twice, burn the talisman and ingest it.'*

**Black Dao/Way Lord Talisman Method** (黑帝符法): On days *rén* (壬) and *guǐ* (癸), use white millet grass as the mat, three feet long. Spread a black silk banner one *zhàng* two feet long upon it. Place two cups of wine and two slices of dried meat on the mat. Use black as the ground, and write the talisman in cinnabar—two inches wide, seven inches long—and cast it upon the mat. The incantation reads:

*'On a fortunate day and auspicious hour,
Your humble servant [name] prostrates twice.
Reverently receiving the Celestial Sovereign Dao/Way Lord’s Black Dao/Way Lord Divine Talisman.
After prostrating twice, burn the talisman and ingest it.'*

**The following methods** are the five Dao/Way Lord Divine Talismans, along with the four additional talismans received by **Master Ge Xuan** (仙公葛玄). Write two copies of each: one to burn and ingest, and one to wear upon the head. These are especially useful for alchemists seeking to forge the elixir beforehand, and should be prepared ten days in advance.

**Treatise on Taboos and Precautions for Alchemical Fusion**

What is elucidated here is the taboo and precautions for alchemical fusion.

The *Nine Cauldrons* and *Nine Elixirs* do not exhaust the method—there are the *Method for Testing the Cauldron and Refining the Medicine*, and the *Method for True Protection After Ingestion*.

Your humble servant notes: The Great Elixir is the refined essence of metals and stones, the treasure of the True Person. Therefore, those who ingest it attain divine transformation, longevity, and vision; they command spirits and ascend to the Celestial Clarity.

Common folk know only the titles of the elixir classics but do not understand the taboos of alchemical fusion. Even if they obtain the formulas, they will never succeed.

For one who seeks to refine the divine elixir, there are **five taboos, three prohibitions, four failures, and six dreads**. If transgressed, the elixir’s essence will scatter, its spiritual flowers will fall, its divine light will sink, and its frost-mists will be lost. Ingesting it will yield no benefit—this must be heeded with utmost caution.

Thus, the True Persons inquired into their particulars. The Mystic Master replied:

**The Five Taboos:**
1. When refining the medicine and igniting the fire, do not use the **Five Dead Days of Stones**—namely, Spring *Rén-Chén* (壬辰), Summer *Guǐ-Wèi* (癸未), Autumn *Bǐng-Xū* (丙戌), and Winter *Dīng-Chǒu* (丁丑). If the elixir is refined on these days and the furnace lit, the stone’s essence will stagnate, the flowers will not rise, the frost-mists will turn toxic, and ingestion will be futile.

2. When purchasing alchemical ingredients or discussing elixir matters, do not use the **Five Malevolent Days**—namely, the *Nine Turnings* of Spring, the *Cloud Purification* day, and the day the purification begins. Before dawn, pour five *dou* of clear wine into flowing water where the purification is held. If no flowing water exists, dig a well and pour the wine into it to purify the earth’s *qi*, so that those purifying may drink this water. Though no ritual invocation is spoken, it is the intent of offering and sacrifice. The elixir’s sublimity demands such rites—even if only symbolically—to fulfill the lower methods’ requirements. Hence, the Primordial Lord says: *"This is not for sacrificing to ghosts or gods."* It is clear.

Before the medicine is fully refined, sincerity must be upheld. Thus, the sacrifice is merely to express the wish for its completion. If the fusion is already finished and another sacrifice is made, this contradicts reason.

The purpose of sacrifice is either for the Celestial Sovereign to descend directly or for the Jade Maiden to be dispatched to assist. The divine *qi* bestows efficacy upon the medicine, enabling the practitioner to attain immortality and longevity.

When refining the elixir in secluded mountain retreats beside flowing eastern waters, erect a ritual platform and house, and complete all earthenware furnace preparations. Once the medicine’s essence is fully refined and the charcoal is ready, observe a hundred-day purification on the *Day of Opening and Expelling*, with no more than three like-minded companions sworn in secrecy. Only after testing the cauldron’s secrecy may the fire be lit.

Before fusing the medicine, observe a seven-day purification. On the *Day of Opening and Expelling* marked by *Jiǎ-Zǐ* (甲子), perform a sacrifice at the cauldron’s side. The sacrificial method uses five *shēng* of clear wine and white wine, three *jīn* of lamb and deer jerky, two *dòu* of yellow grain rice, two *shēng* of large dates, twenty cooked chicken eggs, and a three-*jīn* carp (head included). Arrange three tables, each with three cups, and burn *lù* incense. After two prostrations, recite:

*"Your humble servant [name] now adjusts the medicine to refine the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir. May the divine and immortal Jade Maidens—Playful Maiden, Mystic Maiden, and Waistband Maiden—together perfect it. May the Great Dao Lord, the Great Harmony Lord, and the Supreme Lord grant that your humble servant [name], greedy for life and desiring immortality, may successfully complete this divine elixir."*

After pouring the wine and completing nine prostrations, chant:

*"O Great Dao Lord and Mystic Maiden, as you refine the divine elixir, may it neither scatter nor perish—let all its essence submit to the fire. May its hue be flawless, its transformations effortless, its gold and silver fully formed. May ingestion grant eternal life without end, attaining the True Person."*

Then place the actual medicine, dates, and oranges upon the altar and ignite the fire as prescribed.

For the **Great One’s Sacred Seat**, use a new bed three *chǐ* six *cùn* in length, two *chǐ* eight *cùn* in height, covered with fresh mats, facing west. Place a three-*chǐ* crimson silk cloth upon the mat, and set the sacrificial text for the day the fire is lit.

**The Nine Elixirs’ Sacrificial Method:**
At the refining site, construct a yellow-earth altar nine *chǐ* square, fenced on all sides. The central square is four *chǐ*, with gates on all four sides. Place the furnace six *chǐ* west of the altar. On the altar, arrange a mat of white grass, one *chǐ* long, with five layers of mats, one separate piece, and one cup of jerky and wine. To the east, arrange nine layers of mats, two pieces each, with two cups of jerky and wine. Use two *shēng* of yellow millet rice, three *jīn* (or five *jīn*) of beef and mutton jerky, three carp (three *jīn* total), and steam them. Prepare twenty boiled chicken eggs, three *shēng* of large dates, and one pear. If oranges, pomelos, or other red-hued fruits are available, burn incense, pour wine, and prostrate before the seat. Then proceed with the fire-igniting ritual as before.

After the furnace-side sacrifice, place fresh wine and jerky on three new tables, each with three cups of wine and three *jīn* of jerky. From this point onward, always offer wine and jerky at three locations, day and night without cessation. Replace the jerky every three days and the wine three times daily. Each time, pour the wine with the usual prostrations. From the moment the sacrifice is established, continuously burn incense, day and night without interruption, maintaining utmost purity, reverence, and diligence—never neglecting.

When the medicine is complete, perform another sacrifice as initially done, adding three *jīn* of roasted pork on the eastern seat of the altar, one *shēng* of white rice, and one roasted cock. Recite:

*"The divine medicine is now complete. I now request permission to open the cauldron, as desired."*

The sacrifice concludes with the opening of the cauldron.

In all cases of alchemical fusion, one must first ritually offer wine to the Yellow River’s source to subdue the earth’s *qi*. Additionally, a grand sacrifice to the divine must be made to appease the Eight Stones. If a *Nine Elders’ Jade Pass* is obtained, it will inspect the ten thousand *qi*, repel malevolent spirits, avert assassins and thieves, and ensure divine protection. The fire spirits will naturally submit, rendering further ritual offerings unnecessary—success will follow.

The *Nine Elders’ Jade Pass* states: On the first day of the fast, first inscribe in red on blue-black paper. This paper is also called the *Eight-Substance True Talisman* or the *Supreme Clarity Highest Talisman*, square in form, nine inches wide, two sheets in number. When finished, facing east, recite the incantation:

*"Eight-Substance True Talisman, Nine Elders’ Jade Pass.
Heavenly gods inspect the earth, above protecting the elixir’s essence.
Nine sources sealed, eight rivers brimming with treasure.
Slaying assassins, vanquishing malevolence—jewelous brilliance shines.
Golden nectar, jade frost: the essence of the Eight Stones.
Seven transformations, five changes, nine cycles to completion."*

After reciting, take one sheet and place it in a green brocade pouch, striking it against the chest. Take the other sheet to a well, cutting it in half: cast one half into the dwelling’s water, the other half bury beneath the *Six-One Furnace*, beneath the alchemical cauldron in flowing water—this may be struck with a stone to sink it. The buried portion should be three inches deep. This is the *Mysterious Seal*—the *Treasure Seal of Miao State*. Also called *Xianbo Taiyi’s Inspection* or the *Eight-Inch White Script*. On the first day of the fast, if it falls on *jiazi* or *jia-yin* at noon, face east and inscribe with a green brush upon the *Six-One Cauldron*. Again, take a white sheet, eight inches square, and inscribe this talisman upon it. When finished, recite:

*"Spring: *ren-yin*, Summer: *gui-si*, Autumn: *ren-shen*, Winter: *gui-hai*.
On these days, entering the mountains to refine divine medicine will yield no success—spirits will not aid, and malevolent ghosts will ruin the work."*

Three prohibitions: Do not refine elixir on *Spring geng-yin*, *Summer gui-wei*, *Autumn bing-shen*, or *Winter ding-chou*—these are days when entering the mountains to gather herbs or refine will cause spirits to seize one’s soul, spoiling the elixir and bringing illness.

Four prohibitions: Do not refine elixir in the furnace or seal the divine medicine on *Spring bing-xu*, *Spring bing-chen*, *Summer xin-wei*, *Summer xin-chou*, *Autumn ren-chen*, *Autumn ren-xu*, *Winter gui-wei*, or *Winter gui-chou*—these days will cause the furnace to burst open, elixir essence to scatter, and the Five Stones to disperse, ruining the frost and brilliance.

Five prohibitions: Men refining elixir must avoid the third day of the seventh month and *jia-yin* days in the seventh month; women must avoid the seventh day of the first month and *geng-shen* days in the first month. These four days are when stone spirits clash and ghosts gather. If refining begins on these days, the elixir essence will not manifest, spirits will not respond, and malevolent ghosts will invade, bringing ruin.

This is called the *Five Prohibitions*. The *Three Taboos* are:
1. Weeping or lamenting while refining elixir.
2. Uttering the names of assassins or thieves.
3. Encountering death, decay, or uncleanliness—such as childbirth or nursing.

If these taboos are violated, the stones will fail to coalesce, the Five Brilliances will not shine, and the elixir will become poisonous, killing those who ingest it. Those grieving, near corpses, or involved in death-related matters must not participate in refining frost and snow or tending the furnace.

Elixir also has an assassin ghost—*Stone Leek Child*, surname *Hunni Xi*, whose name must be avoided on the first day of refining. If invoked again, the smoke and frost will collapse, ghostly armies will invade, the divine furnace will shatter, and the essence will scatter—four calamities:
1. The refining site trembles as if traversed by chariots.
2. Envy-bearing individuals (those with malevolent gazes) near the divine medicine invite ghostly retribution.
3. Thunder shakes the cauldron, causing the essence to fall and the brilliance to fail.
4. The presence of pungent foods or burning chicken/dog hair.

These four calamities are the Eight Stones’ greatest taboos—violating them will cause the essence to fail and the elixir to never form. If refining days are insufficient and thunder is heard, quickly cover the cauldron with a damp cloth to suppress the essence, preventing smoke from rising.

Six dreads:
1. On the first day of sealing the medicine and when first igniting the fire, dread wind, rain, and thunder.
2. On the refining day, dread hearing calls to the soul.
3. *(Original text omitted three items; fourth)* Dread hearing weeping or lamentation.
4. Dread encountering blood, filth, or uncleanliness.

These six dreads are the elixir’s strict prohibitions—violating them will disturb the rising essence and damage the brilliance.

**Nine Cauldrons’ Hidden Text on Elixir**

The true person’s alchemical precepts are the precepts of the *Nine Cauldrons’ Elixir*. The first elixir is named *Danhua* (Elixir Flower). This elixir has two names: *Liuzhu Jiuzhuan* (Flowing Pearl Nine Transformations) and *Danhua*.

**Method for *Liuzhu Jiuzhuan*:**
According to the original scripture, first prepare the *Xuanhuang* (Mysterious Yellow). Take one *jin* each of realgar and cinnabar water, mixing them. *(Note: Though the precept lists two ingredients of one jin each, it does not specify the quantity of Xuanhuang nor the method of mixing—dilute or thick. Thus, those who follow this may fail. Referring to the second precept under the name *Shenfu Law*, there are four methods. The second method states: After preparing Xuanhuang, mix it with the Flowing Pearl Nine Transformations’ Xuanhuang water until it turns red—though the fire-charring method differs, its consistency, like mud, remains unchanged.)*

In the *Thirty-Six Waters Method*, there is indeed a *Xuanhuang Water Method*. Yet *Danhua* and *Liuzhu Jiuzhuan* do not employ it. When it states *"above, the Flowing Pearl Nine Transformations’ Xuanhuang water,"* it refers to the Xuanhuang used in the process—cinnabar and realgar waters mixed and subjected to a hundred steams. Place them in a green bamboo tube, thinly scraping its exterior, sealing it with white wood, and covering it with fine yellow sand.

「If the chamber is too spacious, the *qi* will easily disperse, and the fine essence produced will be mixed with earth, appearing yellowish.

This is then submerged with the *Mò* and steamed, and after a short time, it becomes water.
Immediately, it condenses below, then ascends again as water—thus, a hundred times up and down.

Again, take one *jīn* each of realgar and cinnabar waters, and use them to refine the *Xuanhuang*.
Place them in a sealed crucible and subject to sublimation—do this nine times in succession.
When the *Xuanhuang* essence is fully refined, remove it.

Take this one *jīn* of *Xuanhuang*, and divide it into nine portions.
Then take one portion and further divide it into two.

Next, prepare two crucibles: one as the *Taìqīng Dān* "White Snow Soil Crucible" method, detailed in the sixth volume of *Shàngshù* (already explained).
This method is not repeated here.

Then, take twenty *jīn* of oyster shell and seventy *jīn* of red stone pitch, grind them into powder, and ferment with soil for a hundred days to form a paste. Grind them again with three thousand strokes, and coat the soil crucible.
Take two *jīn* of mercury and place it in the soil crucible, covering it with the two portions of *Xuanhuang* above and below.
Then seal the two crucibles tightly with the oyster shell and red stone pitch paste, smearing them green on the outside.
Combine them securely and let them dry in the shade for ten days.

Set an iron pot atop, with legs raised nine *cùn* high.
Use horse dung fire or fire from parched rice husks—burn for three days and nights, then cool for one day.
Upon completion, open and retrieve the sublimed essence, discarding the dregs.
If the dregs, when burned, yield a residue, it means the *qi* of the medicine is not fully exhausted.
Repeat the sublimation as before until the *qi* is fully spent.
Afterward, adjust the fire as needed, prolonging the sublimation until it is complete.

Take one portion of *Xuanhuang* and divide it into two, covering the soil crucible above and below with it, then subliming it while sealed as before.
Do this nine times in succession, then open and retrieve the sublimed essence.

Next, take seven *túlóng* (earthwax) pieces.
The master’s secret is this: the scriptures sometimes refer to them simply as *lónggāo* (wax), or as *túlónggāo* (earthwax).
There is no difference—they are all white-necked, curved ants.

Place them in a vessel, coat with salt, and let them dissolve into water.
Use this to mix with the sublimed essence, then sublimate again.»

As before, sublimate for three days and nights, then cool for one day, and open to collect it—the five-colored frost, called *Liúzhū Jiǔzhuàn* (Flowing Pearl Nine Transformations).

I privately think that even these curved ants and tiny creatures are sentient.
To take their fragile lives to prolong my own years—
this is contrary to benevolence and righteousness.
The Confucian way forbids it.

Moreover, when refining the elixir in thirty-six waters,
one should not hear the cries of slaughtered livestock,
nor the sounds of weeping and lamentation.
Even among the three taboos,
one must also avoid sorrow and grief.
Thus, even the lowliest creatures are spared.
Where blades strike, who would not fear?
Only when absolutely necessary
does the greater righteousness allow the sacrifice of kin.
If one can safely escape the four nets,
there is the virtue of opening the three paths.

Regarding the second elixir, named *Shénfú* (Divine Symbol) Elixir,
the four methods of the *Sìzhōng* (Four Central) scripture
first use the first method—
mixing the elixir with *Xuányè* (Mysterious Liquid) like mud,
which can substitute for this.

Again, the first elixir is called the *Dānhuá* (Elixir Flower) method.
If the medicine does not comply,
use *Xuánshuǐyè* (Mysterious Water Liquid) and *lónggāo* (wax) to moisten it,
mixing until thoroughly damp, then sublimate again—
thus, it is refined for thirty-six days.
These two substances
do not rely on the juice of curved ants.

Moreover, *Xīlónggāo* (Western Wax)
is the dew from mulberry leaves.
The juice of the *qūmiǎn* (curved ants) and other insects
are all autumn morning dew—
their quality varies when pressed,
and ancient methods must not be altered.
I dare not omit or change them;
instead, I rely on the *Xuánshuǐyè*’s own secret, as follows:

For those who take the first elixir,
the *Liúzhū Jiǔzhuàn* and the *Dānhuá* elixirs—
on a *Jiǎzǐ* (Gabi) day at dawn,
facing the sun, bow twice,
then kneel long and take it like millet grains—
instantly, one becomes an immortal,
ascending to the Nine Heavens.
Taking half a millet grain
makes one an earthly immortal—
unaffected by water or fire,
immune to calamities and blades,
free to transform at will,
entering and exiting without hindrance,
commanding ghosts and spirits,
with a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth.

If one wishes to depart this world,
taking another half millet grain
will instantly send them to Heaven.
To elevate a mortal,
take it like a small bean grain—
they will ascend that very day.
Taking half a small bean grain
makes them an earthly immortal.

Even livestock, if given a large bean grain,
will ascend to Heaven at once.
Thus it is said:
A crow becomes a phoenix,
a beast becomes a qilin,
a serpent becomes a dragon,
a ghost becomes a spirit,
a woman becomes a jade maiden,
a man becomes an immortal.

Mixing snake fat into four pills,
each the size of a shot pellet,
and burying them at the four corners of one’s residence—
the house will transform into a red dragon,
lifting the entire dwelling to Heaven,
seven thousand feet above the earth,
where it becomes gold and jade,
free to roam as desired.

Burying one pill the size of a chicken egg yolk,
near or far—within a thousand *li* in any direction,
down to the Nine Abysses—
all rivers, mountains, and forests within
will ascend to Heaven.

Take one *catty* of firm, fine-grained yellow earth,
grind and sift it, then boil in three cycles of scalding water.
Add one *qian* (gram) and stir until thoroughly mixed,
simmering until the water evaporates—
it will turn to gold.

According to this secret,
at first hearing, it seems unbelievable.
Yet the teachings of sages
are not easily slandered.
Long ago, the Eight Immortals told King Huainan:
*"I can refine mud into gold in one boil
and solidify mercury into silver—
this is indeed the power of the elixir."*
Yet the King only received the *Wǔlíng* (Five Spirits) method,
not the *Jiǔdǐng* (Nine Cauldrons) secret.
Thus, Liu An bowed repeatedly
but never attained it.
The Way of knowing is difficult to perceive.

Yet even common copper and iron,
when infused with elixir power
and stirred into a paste,
naturally differ from their original forms—
this cannot be dismissed as false.

Even lead, tin, mercury, or iron—
one *catty* of any—
when mixed with one *qian* of elixir,
will all become gold.
This is the most forbidden secret of Master Zhāng,
so the original scripture does not record it.

---
**Second Elixir: *Dānhuá* Method**
The *Dānhuá* elixir uses only earthen crucibles,
just like the *Báixuě* (White Snow) method.
Place the medicine inside, seal it, and set it
on three iron tripods over fire,
as in the second elixir’s *Shénfú* (Divine Symbol) method
from the *Dānjié* (Elixir Secrets).
The first method uses the *Dānhuá* crucible
to sublimate the two divine symbols—
this is supremely effective.

This elixir, once sealed,
ascends and descends nine times without opening.
Place mercury in the crucible,
then seal the two earthen crucibles’ mouths
with *mǔlì* (oyster shell) and *chìshízhī* (red stone pitch) mud.
Let it dry in shade, then set it
on three iron tripods over fire,
nine inches above the ground,
using husk-fire for one day and night.
Invert the crucible (lower becomes upper)
without opening it, for another day and night.
Repeat nine ascensions and descensions,
then cool for one day before opening
to collect the sublimed essence.
Mix it with *lǐyúdǎn* (crucian carp bile)
until thoroughly damp, then return it
to the earthen crucible.
Seal it with *Liùyī* (Six-One) mud
as in the *Dānhuá* crucible method,
let it dry, then fire it as before—
one day and night.
After nine ascensions and descensions,
mix in *Xīlónggāo* (Western Wax),
which is mulberry dew,
until thoroughly damp.

Separately, take *qiānhuánghuá* (lead yellow flower)
and mercury, refining them as in the scriptures
to produce *Liúzhū* (Flowing Pearl) five-colored *Xuányè* (Mysterious Liquid).
When ten *catties* are obtained,
divide them into nine portions.
Take one portion and split it into two.
Prepare three earthen crucibles, each holding six,
then take the previously sublimed nine times mercury
and place it in the crucible.
Cover the top and bottom with two portions of five-colored *Xuányè*,
then seal the crucible’s rim with *Liùyī* mud,
three *cùn* thick, and let it dry in shade for ten days.
Fire it with husk-fire for nine days and nights,
cool for one day, then collect the sublimed essence
and return it to the original earthen crucible.
Again, take one portion of five-colored *Xuányè*,
split it into two, and cover the top and bottom,
sealing and firing as before.

Thus are the nine transformations complete.

For the third transformation, replace the crucibles with two new earthen ones, as per the *Tàiqīng Dān Jiǔdǐng Jíyào* method. The nine transformations require three sets of six crucibles each.

As the original scripture states: *"Three preparations for nine transformations—this is it."*

The medicinal potency and timing align with the nine transformations of *Liúzhū* (Flowing Pearl).

This divine symbol elixir can also transmute mercury into elixir. The method: take one *catty* of mercury, heat it in an iron vessel, then add one *qian* of divine symbol elixir, stirring until it transforms into divine elixir. It is called *Huándān* (Returning Elixir). As the scripture says: *"This is the method of treating mercury to form elixir."*

Ingest it as per the *Dānhuā* (Elixir Flower) method.

Another second method for the divine symbol: prepare *Xuányè* (Mysterious Liquid) separately, as in the original scripture, completing the *Xuányè*. This *Xuányè* refers to the *Xuányè* of nine *catties* of mercury and one *catty* of lead—not the three *Xuányè* methods in the *Huāfǎ* (Flower Method).

Take the previously refined *Liúzhū* nine-transformations *Xuányè* water.

According to the *Xuányè Shuǐ Běnjīng* by Zhang Tian Shi: *"The elixir flower is indeed the first flower—it is water. Upon careful examination, it is not the water of cinnabar or realgar."*

The *Xuányè* water method lacks proper instruction among the thirty-six waters. This water is obtained by steaming—no doubt about it. Mix it into a paste, heat it in an iron vessel until red, then blend with *Xuánshuǐ yè* (Mysterious Water Liquid). *Xuánshuǐ yè* is also called *Xuánshuǐ zé*—it is magnetite water.

Its preparation: one *catty* of magnetite, two *liǎng* of realgar, and two *liǎng* of *shídǎn jīng* (stone gall essence) are placed in a bamboo tube, sealed with lacquer as before, and submerged in the *Huāchí* (Flower Pool) for thirty days to form water.

Another method: carve bamboo into a *qiān* shape, fill it with saltpeter, bury it in a well three *chǐ* above water, and wait twenty days for the water to form. Add saltpeter again for another twenty days to complete the water. Add mica for another twenty days. If it does not transform, rebury it.

*"Red Dragon’s blood"* refers to cinnabar placed inside. *"Green Dragon’s blood"* refers to *zēngqīng* (blue-green vitriol) placed inside. *"Mysterious Water Liquid"* refers to magnetite placed inside.

All methods involve burying in a well. When needed, test both methods to determine the superior one.

Shape into a paste, place in an earthen crucible, seal, and fire as per the scripture.

The third divine symbol method: take the *Xuányè* from the nine-transformations *Liúzhū*, mix it with *Huāchí* into a paste, coat the earthen crucible, and let it dry. Place mercury inside, cover with one crucible, seal with *Liùyī* mud, let it dry in shade for ten days. Place on three iron tripods and fire for nine days and nights, then cool for one day. Open and ingest as per the *Dānhuā* method.

This mercury must be the nine-times sublimed, detoxified mercury. All others are unusable.

The fourth method’s *Xuányè* is also from the nine-transformations *Liúzhū*. The earthen crucibles used in the nine elixirs follow the *Tàiqīng Báixuě* method without variation.

**Third Elixir: Divine Elixir Method**
Mix realgar and orpiment as in the original scripture. First, coat the two earthen crucibles with *Xuányè* paste, three *fēn* thick, and let it dry in shade for ten days. Place realgar and orpiment inside, then coat the crucible mouths with *Xuányè* paste, seal, and apply *Liùzhōu* mud at the rim, three *fēn* thick, letting it dry. Place on three iron tripods and fire as before.

**Fourth Elixir: Returning Elixir Method**
First, calcine *yùshí* (jade stone) and *fánshí* (alum stone) with nine other substances in charcoal fire. Seal in an earthen crucible, layer one *catty* of *Xuányè* on top, then one *catty* of mercury beneath it. Next, layer one *catty* of realgar (pounded a thousand times) and one *catty* of mercury, followed by seven other substances, each one *catty*, layered as described in the scripture. Seal and fire as per the method—do not deviate from the timing.

**Fifth Elixir: Elixir Pill Method**
Coat the two earthen crucibles with *Xuányè* paste, three *fēn* thick, and let it dry. Place the medicines inside, seal, and fire on three iron tripods nine *cùn* high, as per the scripture.

**Sixth Elixir: Refining Elixir Method**
Mix *tǔlóng gāo* (earthworm juice), *tǔlóng shǐ* (earthworm essence), yellow dog bile, oyster shell, and red stone pitch into a paste to coat the crucible. Spread *Xuányè* on the crucible bottom, half-*cùn* thick, then place the medicines inside, seal, and fire as before. The rest follows the scripture.

(*Tǔlóng gāo* refers to earthworm juice.)

**Seventh Elixir: Soft Elixir Method**
As per the scripture, place mercury in the crucible, coat the two crucibles’ rims with *Xuányè* paste, seal tightly, and apply *Liùyī* mud, three *fēn* thick. Place on three iron tripods and fire as per the method.

**Eighth Elixir: Subdued Elixir Method**
As per the scripture, coat the crucible with *Liùyī* mud, then layer one *catty* of *Xuányè* or lead white at the bottom. Place mercury above the *Xuányè*. Pound and sift one *catty* each of *zēngqīng* (blue-green vitriol) and magnetite separately. First, layer *zēngqīng* over the mercury, then layer magnetite over the *zēngqīng*, and finally layer one *catty* of *Xuányè* (previously mixed with *lónggāo* to a moist state) over the magnetite. Seal and fire as per the method.

After nine ascensions and nine descensions, reapply *lónggāo* to moisten it before subliming again.

**Ninth Elixir: Cold Elixir Method**
As per the scripture, first layer one *catty* of *Xuányè* at the crucible’s base, then place the medicines in order.

**Sealing the Crucible as per the Method**
As the scripture states, the sealing must be done properly.

It is further said: *"Zǐmíng"* refers to **fire**. In the **Second Elixir of the Divine**, the method of preparing *Xuányè* (lead white) differs from the rest. All other elixirs follow the **Nine Ascensions of the Flowing Pearl and Lead White** method.

**Method for Opening the Crucible**
The subject notes: The crucible and furnace must be sturdy and tightly sealed, known as the **Divine Chamber**. Between the two vessels, the space is firmly filled with *Zhōnghuáng* (realgar), and when fire is applied, it becomes even more solid. The mud layer must be thick.

One must not strike, chisel, or tap the crucible, but rather prepare **two or three sharp saws** to gradually cut through it, or use a whetstone to sharpen it like a blade until the crucible’s material is exposed. Then, with iron implements, one may cautiously open it layer by layer.

Next, the upper vessel is inverted, and the **sublimated essence** is brushed away and collected.

The method then advises using **cock’s feathers**, specifically noting that the cock is the **bird of the *yǒu* hour** (酉禽), implying that **white feathers** are preferable. Before use, one should raise a pair of **pure white cocks and hens**, nurturing them until they lay eggs. Their **feathers from the wings’ tips**—known as *liáofēngmáo* (wind feathers)—are taken, **three from each bird**, without washing or wiping them, to sweep the **sublimated frost** (飞霜华).

The elixir is then placed in a **golden container**, sealed tightly, and wrapped in a **brocade pouch**. The scripture states: *"Dàizhòu"* (carrying at the elbow) is the correct way to keep it close, for it is too precious to leave unattended, and one must also guard against accidental ingestion before its potency is realized, lest its **transformation** (神化) fail.

**Testing the Medicine**
The subject notes: The **Daoist alchemical scriptures** state that the medicine must first be tested by refining **gold**. If the gold succeeds, then the elixir is complete. If the gold does not succeed, then the elixir is not yet complete.

Further sublimation must be conducted until the **gold is formed** as the standard. Though there are precise measures for the **Nine Ascensions**, one must carefully verify them with other methods when testing.

According to the **Nine Ascensions method**, take **ten catties of lead**, place it in an iron vessel, and boil it with **fierce fire** until it bubbles three times. The **sublimated essence** from the Nine Ascensions is **one grain**, which is then stirred into the lead. In a short while, **nine catties of yellow gold** will form.

Again, take **seven catties of tin**, place it in an iron vessel, and apply **fierce fire** until it bubbles three times. Stir **one grain of the Nine Ascensions essence** into it, and in a short while, **white silver** will form.

The obtained **sublimated essence** must first be weighed. If it is sufficient for **thousands of people**, then one may proceed to test for gold. One must not hastily sell the medicine based on a single method’s results.

The **concentrated residue** (浓丹滓) can also be used to produce silver, if desired. The testing is conducted according to this method.

At the time of refining, one must strictly adhere to the original scripture. The measures for consumption and protection must also follow the **orthodox method**.

**Subject’s Observations on Consumption and Protection**
The subject notes: Those who consume the elixir upon completion are often **unrefined practitioners** (格人). Among them, the **Three Grades**—upper, middle, and lower—are distinguished.

If the **upper-grade adept** consumes it, they will ascend to **True Personhood** (登真) in seven days. If the **middle-grade adept** consumes it, they will attain **immortality** (得仙) in seventy days. If the **lower-grade or foolish practitioner** consumes it, they will become immortal in a year.

If one’s resolve is sincere and they dare to ingest the elixir in one dose, they will all **temporarily die for half a day**, then revive as if awakening from sleep. This is the **most perilous** method, requiring strict adherence to the proportions—**half a grain of glutinous millet** is the measure.

The subject further notes: When taking **medicines for healing**, they should be consumed **before meals**. When taking **medicines for cultivating the Dao**, they should be consumed **after meals**.

This is because **medicines that attack illness** should be taken when the stomach is empty and **malignant qi** (毒气) has not yet circulated. If taken after meals, the medicine’s power is wasted in **digesting food**.

If one wishes to **nourish the Dao** by taking medicine before meals, then the **virtue/power of the medicine** (药力) is not yet fully activated, and the food will **drive it downward**, rendering it ineffective. It cannot eliminate the **upper ailments** (上病) and thus yields no benefit.

Though the **Divine Elixir** (神丹) has great efficacy, one must strictly follow the **orthodox scriptures** and their measures, not disregarding the **common prohibitions** (常涂小禁) or minor taboos.

The subject notes: Each person’s lifespan and constitution have their own **affinities**. If one’s **life-affinity** (年命所属) is **earth**, they must not consume **green-colored medicines**. Others should follow this principle accordingly.

All **restrictions and taboos** (拘忌) must be observed to align with the **natural order** (克顺). If the **golden elixir** or **precious medicines** (丹金大药) possess **transformation** (神化) of extraordinary marvel, then the question of **appropriateness or prohibition** is no longer relevant.
