**Volume One: The Surging Spring Cauldron Elixir Preface**

Heaven and Earth originate from yin and yang; lead and mercury arise from water and soil.
Water and soil nurture eternal life in *shēn* (申), where yang is born from *hài zǐ* (亥子).
*Zǐ* (子) is the Heavenly One, generating the flourishing phase of water.
Fire is born in *yín* (寅), yin in *wèi wǔ* (巳午), and *wǔ* (午) is the Earthly Two, the peak position of fire’s vitality.

Without yin and yang, there is no water and fire—thus, nothing can be formed. The elixir furnace follows this principle.
Water descends to Earth—how then does it summon rain from Heaven?
Fire ascends to Heaven—how then does it bring heat to Earth?

Truly, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth rises and falls, merging in exchange.
Through this union, the four seasons are formed, and all things are complete.
Heavenly *qi* descends from above to Earth, while Earthly *qi* ascends from below to Heaven.
Thus, life is generated, and form is perfected—two *qi* embrace, condense spirit, and gather *qi* to manifest substance.

Each follows its kind: jade, stone, grasses, and trees; birds, insects, scales, and shells; and beasts that walk.
Yet jade, stone, gold, and silver are most esteemed—all are natural treasures born of Heaven and Earth’s transformative *qi*, prized by the world.

Now, gold and silver originate from cinnabar (*dānshā*).
Humans refine it to separate its yellow and white hues.
Within cinnabar lies a refined essence called *gǒng* (mercury), also called *shuǐyín* (water silver).
Though named "water silver," it never truly wets things—its moisture is unseen, yet it contains water within.
It drips and scatters like pearls to Earth, impossible to gather once lost.
When exposed to fire, it flees as smoke, vanishing before the eyes—yet something can subdue it.

In the *Běn Cǎo* (Materia Medica), under the *Yùshí* (Jade and Stone) section, there is *liúhuáng* (sulfur) and *gāngǒng* (dry mercury), which produce *língshā* (spirit sand).
Eight parts (yin) and three parts (yang) are balanced—
Ancients used eight *liǎng* (两) of mercury with two *liǎng* of sulfur in one crucible, refining them through *shuǐhuǒ jíbì* (Water-Fire Reunion) to extract it.
Some used three *liǎng* of sulfur to nine *liǎng* of mercury, refining as yang to treat ailments.

Since ancient times, the Yellow Emperor (Xuānyuán Huángdì) ascended Luohe Mountain, where a yellow-robed boy taught him sixty methods for gold and silver.
From then, these arts have spread for a thousand years, revered by successive dynasties—yet their originators’ names are lost to time.

Since the *Bǎoyìng* era of the Tang Dynasty, the *Lèibiān Běn Cǎo* (Classified Materia Medica) has been known, and the *Dānfáng Jìngyuán* (Mirror of the Elixir Chamber) has been published, detailing the marvelous properties of medicines, containing Daoist and immortal techniques.
The *Běn Cǎo*’s *Yùshí* section on gold, silver, and stones elaborates further.

There are alchemists who can dry mercury’s mother ore to produce true silver.
Such secrets have rarely been passed down from ancient times to now—few indeed possess this art.

I, though poor, pity the poor, and though poor, I value righteousness.
I once encountered a Daoist master who transmitted the *gāngǒng* (dry mercury) method—
the *língshā* (spirit sand) is washed and refined, yielding the Surging Spring Elixir of eternal life.
This wondrous, concise method requires no excess—results appear swiftly.
A single batch yields tens of thousands of *liǎng* of silver, for where the mother is abundant, the child is plentiful; where the field is vast, the grain is rich.

The *Dān Jīng* (Elixir Classic) says:
*"Like a hen brooding an egg—from nothing, something emerges."*

The Classic also states:
*"To obtain dry mercury, one must first have dry mercury.
To kill mercury, nothing surpasses dead mercury."*

The *Dān Jīng* further declares:
*"Five metals meet their kind and die; eight stones encounter saltpeter and perish."*
A common proverb says:
*"Sow wheat, reap wheat; sow beans, reap beans."*

This method is like tilling a field to harvest grain—
yet there is no drought or flood.
Mercury is the most difficult to kill, for when burned, it becomes *yínzhū* (cinnabar red), and when *yínzhū* is burned again, it reverts to mercury—truly difficult to kill.
To kill mercury is to attain immortality.
Once the treasure is revealed, it no longer revives—
it may be freely shaped into vessels.

The *Dān Jīng* says:
*"Nine transformations complete the Great Return Elixir of Gold."*
The Returned Elixir becomes *zǐjīn fěn* (purple gold powder),
which is then used to dry mercury, turning it yellow or white.

Though methods vary, the core of drying mercury remains one.

There is the *Huángyá Dàdān* (Great Elixir of Yellow Sprouts),
which subdues the Four Celestial Fires to forge a golden treasure.
Cutting its yellow sprouts and applying silver yields *gēng* (regent metal).

Another method involves nurturing fire with elixir for twelve years,
or one year of elixir for each year of fire-nurturing.

There are *dútǐ* (single-substance) cinnabar, sulfur, and *xiónghuáng* (realgar),
as well as four refined nurturing methods:
*Liùjiǎ fēixióng* (Six Regents Flying Phoenix),
*Tàiyī Zhōngdān* (Central Elixir of the Supreme One),
and treasures like *hǔpò pípái zhūshā* (amber and white arsenic cinnabar),
*Bái Língshā* (White Spirit Sand),
*Jīn Língshā* (Golden Spirit Sand),
and *Tàiyī Shénjīngshā* (Supreme One’s Divine Essence Sand).

There are also:
*Dānzhì Mǔshā* (Single-Refined Mother Ore),
*Fěncōng* (Powdered Frost),
*Qiān Bái Cōng* (Lead White Frost),
*Jiànbǎo Zhūshā Fǎ* (Treasure-Revealing Cinnabar Method),
*Shénfú Bái Xuě* (Divine Protector White Snow),
*Hēi Língshā* (Black Spirit Sand),
*Jīndǐng Pípái* (Golden Crucible Arsenic),
*Bái Hǔ Kuì* (White Tiger Cauldron),
*Hēi Hǔ Kuì* (Black Tiger Cauldron),
*Xiāo Kuì* (Saltpeter Cauldron),
*Pípái Kuì* (Arsenic Cauldron).

And further:
*Jū Líng Gòng Kuì Jiāolín Shā* (Jade Spirit Shared Cauldron Washing Sand),
*Jiànbǎo Jiǔ Zhuǎn Língshā* (Treasure-Revealing Nine Transformations Spirit Sand),
*Jiànbǎo Jiǔ Zhēn Língshā* (Treasure-Revealing Nine True Spirit Sands), named *Wūtuán* (Black Cluster).

The *Wūtuán* refines spirit sand into *Wūtuán Yǎnghuǒ Chéngbǎo* (Black Cluster Nurturing Fire into Treasure),
yielding hundreds of thousands of *liǎng* of silver.

Another method involves *Gōnglǐng Sūn Jiù Jiāolín* (Public Leader Grandson Washing in the Cauldron),
nurturing for seven days, turning green-black.
Gathered beneath a torch flame, passed through a bright furnace,
it becomes the Surging Spring Cauldron.

One *liǎng* of *Wūtuán* nurtures one *qián* (钱).
For every ten *liǎng* of elixir head, wash with two and a half *liǎng* of mercury—
this is the method of nurturing four *liǎng* to produce one *liǎng* of mercury.

This is the minor nurturing method.
Using ten *liǎng* of elixir head as the standard,
refine two and a half *liǎng* of spirit sand—
once removed from the furnace, it is named *Wūtuán*.

「Twenty *liǎng* as the standard, then nurture five *liǎng* of it.
Using forty *liǎng* of *Surging Spring Cauldron* elixir head,
nurture ten *liǎng* of mercury—
this is the method of nurturing for seven days with fire.

For every hundred *liǎng* of elixir head,
nurture with fire for seventeen days.
With twenty-five *liǎng* of dry mercury,
the yield will be abundant.

Both large and small furnaces follow this method.

Another method involves the *Sanqī Mǔshā* (Three-Seven Mother Sand),
deposited into the *Surging Spring Cauldron*,
where fire nurtures it until completion,
named *Qiónghuā Yōngxuě* (Jade Flower Embracing Snow)—
indeed, its benefits are boundless.

The *Méihé Yín* (Plum Kernel Silver) methods
are all but trifling techniques.

Among medicines, there are the *Eight Dragon Sprouts* (八般龙芽草)
and the *Sixteen Marvelous Grasses* (十六般奇草),
each with their own names.

Though myriad methods exist, dry mercury remains supreme.
After achieving the *Miào Chéngbǎo* (Wondrous Treasure),
the dry mercury sand,
passed through a bright furnace and refined into a single vaporous melt,
contains several *guān* (关) of medicinal properties—
the *liúli* (硫璃) *guān*,
the *tiěshā* (铁砂) *guān*—
when the shell is stripped away and the white essence revealed,
this is the *Nine True* (九真) method.

There is also the *Fùguì guān* (富贵关),
where silver leaf wraps the dry mercury sand,
three-seven as the measure,
and after passing through a bright furnace in a single melt,
reveals the *qiānhuáng guān* (铅黄关).

These two methods are the critical *guān* (关) for achieving treasure from spirit sand—
never a single one is lost.
This method of dry mercury,
brings wealth and honor to the body,
saves others and benefits all—
truly, it is no idle boast,
a priceless Daoist art worth ten thousand gold.

In the past, I carelessly entrusted it to a high person,
who, upon receiving it, preserved it.
Only those with *yìqì* (义气, righteousness/loyalty) and *dàoxīn* (道心, Daoist heart) could attain it—
those who had green merit in a past life now receive it in this one.
Yet if kept secret and not passed on,
how can it save others and benefit all?
The art, hidden from the world, conceals Heaven’s treasure.

The origin of refining elixirs
traces to the *Dan* (丹) masters *Zhāng Fùhú* (张富壶) and *Yáng Jiǔdǐng* (杨九鼎) of *Xīshǔ* (西蜀, Western Shu).
This was my father’s master’s practice,
and the master’s practice was passed to me—
both were near the esteemed *Bǎoxuán* (宝玄, Precious Mysterious) lineage.

My teacher received this rare transmission,
treasured beyond measure.
Yet those who now receive it from me
regard it as commonplace,
valuing it lightly despite its noble essence.»

The transmission must not betray the teacher,
nor obscure the heart—
to endure long and enjoy wealth and honor,
to aid the poor and relieve suffering,
it must be preserved and kept secret.
Do not lightly divulge it.

Thus it is said.
In the year *bǐngchén* (丙辰), on the *Yíngfù Rì* (迎富日, Wealth-Receiving Day),
the disciple *Zhāo Nài’ān* (赵耐庵, Zhao Endurance-Annoyance) records this:

**Seeing the *Bǎolíngshā* (宝灵砂, Precious Spirit Sand) for the *Chángshēng Yǒngquán* (长生涌泉, Eternal Spring Fountain) vessel:**

1. **Transparent sulfur**—two *liǎng* (两), like goose-fat blocks, unadulterated by stone.
   **Mercury**—eight *liǎng*, without the tortoise-tail impurity.
   First, grind the sulfur finely, then mix with the mercury and grind together for half a day,
   until no more sparks appear—this is called *yīnjiāo yùn* (阴交媾, Yin-Yang Copulation).
   Next, add *qīngjīntóu* (青金头, Green Gold—likely *qīngtǐng* 青铅, green lead) in the form of iron filings,
   and roast with *wǔhuǒ* (文火, gentle fire) and *wǔhuǒ* (武火, fierce fire) alternately for half a day,
   stirring frequently up and down with slow fire—
   do not let smoke rise.
   The process is complete when the green turns to sand.

2. **Prepare a water-fire *dǐng* (鼎, furnace) pair**—each capable of holding fifteen *liǎng*.
   First, test each with water overnight to ensure no leaks.
   After drying, rub the exterior with fresh ginger juice,
   then bake it several times, and pierce the ears with iron wire for suspension.

3. **For sealing (*gùjì* 固济):**
   Sift fine yellow earth through silk cloth—
   for every six *liǎng* of dry earth, add one *liǎng* of *guàn* (盥, a type of clay),
   known as *liùyī ní* (六一泥, Six-to-One Mud), mixed with paper fibers.
   Pound this mixture a thousand times, then apply it to the furnace one finger’s thickness,
   and dry it in the shade or with gentle heat.

4. **Prepare *kūnlún mò* (昆仑墨, Kunlun Ink):**
   Grind chicken egg whites with high-quality ink,
   and coat the interior of the fire furnace and the underside of the water vessel.
   After drying, finely grind the *qīngjīntóu* again and pack it into the furnace.
   Then, with thickened rice vinegar, mix *chìshízhī* (赤石脂, red stone pitch) and *mǒyào* (牡蛎, oyster shell, powdered from previously broken shells) in equal parts.
   Apply this to the furnace’s mouth and the water vessel’s back,
   tightly bind the furnace’s mouth with iron wire,
   and coat the entire structure with the sealing mixture.
   Dry in the shade—if cracks appear, reapply.
   This method applies universally to all elixir furnaces.

5. **Construct a square brick furnace**, six *cùn* (寸) deep, with an interior width of one *chǐ* (尺).
   Leave ventilation holes one *cùn* wide on each side.
   Position it according to the *fēngjǐng* (风井, wind-well) *guà* (卦, trigram).
   Inside, hammer in three *dīng* (丁, supports), each five *cùn* long,
   driven two *cùn* into the ground, leaving three *cùn* above to hold the furnace.
   First, heat the furnace to remove moisture.
   Hang a *jiùmìng gōu* (救命钩, life-saving hook) above the furnace to suspend the vessel.

6. **Fueling the furnace:**
   Use ten *jīn* (斤) of charcoal, divided into three stages of red-hot coals.
   First, place three *jīn* at the furnace’s base—
   when the fire begins to subside, add another three *jīn* to reach halfway up the furnace.
   Finally, add four *jīn*, split into two portions, to reach just below the furnace’s rim.
   Cover with tiles to smother the flames, then place *zhōngmǐfěn* (中麸粉, middling bran) on top to absorb residual moisture.
   Wait until the fire fully subsides, then open the furnace the next morning.

   **For water addition (before sealing):**
   Measure seven *dǐng* (鼎, furnace volumes) of water—
   the standard is six *dǐng* plus four *fèn* (分).
   Use a bottle to hold the water at room temperature—never cold.
   When adding water, introduce only five *fèn* at a time—
   never fill it completely.
   If boiling becomes violent, use a lead rod or tile to calm it.
   Alternatively, place a wick from a burned oil lamp inside to regulate the boil.
   If water overflows and risks seeping through the seal, losing the *língshā* (灵砂, spirit sand),
   immediately apply sealing mixture with a brush.
   Otherwise, place an ash bucket nearby, quickly transfer the furnace into it,
   then reseal—this is critical.

   **Timing:**
   Begin firing at *zǐshí* (子时, 11 PM–1 AM), cease at *wǔshí* (午时, 11 AM–1 PM).
   Resume at *mǎoshí* (卯时, 5–7 AM), cease at *yǒushí* (酉时, 5–7 PM).

7. **After opening the furnace:**
   Split the extracted *língshā* into square blocks the size of a thumb.
   Wrap each in thick silk pouches, then place them in a jar holding five *shēng* (升) of water.
   Add three *shēng* of rice vinegar (each *shēng* with two *dǒu* of alcohol),
   twenty-one *báiméi* (白梅, white plum kernels),
   *bái yǒu* (白友, a type of mineral, in block form) and *bái yín* (白嵚, another mineral) each half *liǎng*,
   and half a *liǎng* of lotus leaf ash.
   Suspend the *língshā* blocks in the vinegar mixture and simmer for one *fúshí* (伏时, a period of 60 days, or metaphorically, a day and night).
   If the vinegar evaporates, replenish it and continue with slow heat—
   do not let it boil over.
   After cooking, bathe the sand in *gāncǎo* (甘草, licorice) decoction—both *yīnyáng tāng* (阴阳汤, yin-yang broth).
   Dry thoroughly in the shade.
   Next, mix half a *liǎng* of *huángdān* (黄丹, yellow cinnabar) and half a *liǎng* of *sháo fěn* (韶粉, a type of powder, possibly borax),
   thickened with rice vinegar, called *tiēshēn* (贴身, body-adherent).
   Apply half of this mixture evenly to the cooked *língshā* blocks and dry in the shade.
   If applied too thickly, the medicinal *qi* will not circulate;
   if too thin, the *qi* will dissipate.
   Use only half the mixture now—reserve the rest.

8. **Prepare forty *liǎng* of pure silver**—mountain or stream silver, or *yuánbǎo* (元宝, silver ingots).
   Melt it into a liquid, then pour it onto a swept floor,
   allowing it to cool into pearl-like lumps the size of a rooster’s head.
   Alternatively, hammer the silver into square blocks the size of a little finger.
   Apply the remaining *tiēshēn* mixture to the silver lumps or blocks and dry in the shade.
   Use a *yǎnghuǒ hézi* (养火合子, fire-nurturing crucible)—preferably from *Chǔzhōu* (处州).
   First, wash the interior with borax solution and dry it.
   Shape heated iron wire into handles, secure them, and seal the crucible with *liùyī ní* one finger’s thickness.
   Dry in the shade or with gentle heat—do not let it crack.
   Line the crucible’s base with silver, then place the *língshā* blocks at its center.
   Fill the surrounding space with *yínzhū* (银朱, cinnabar) until full,
   and seal the top with a silver lid.
   Cut *kūnlún zhǐ* (昆仑纸, Kunlun paper) to size, coat it thickly with chicken egg white and ink,
   dry it, and use it to seal the crucible’s mouth.

Seal the crucible’s mouth with a paste of vinegar, mixed with powdered *chìshízhī* (赤石脂, red stone pitch) and *mǎoxiè* (牡蛎, oyster shell), and apply it to the seam. Secure the crucible with fire-nurturing heat.

Fix the iron wire handles firmly, ensuring the seams are tightly bound—no leakage, not even a hair’s breadth. Reinforce the exterior with *liùyī ní*, dry it gently with low heat, and ensure it does not crack before placing it in the ash pit.

The ash pit is made from a small jar, thoroughly washed and dried. Fill it with *zhǐqián huī* (纸钱灰, paper money ash) to a depth of about one *shallow jar’s measure*, sifted and dried by cold roasting. Use a fire basin to heat charcoal red-hot for this purpose. Over time, the charcoal ash will settle and become dense; replace it as needed. Ash from bamboo leaves, thatch grass, or mulberry leaves may also be used.

Place an iron three-legged stand at the jar’s base to support the fire-nurturing crucible. Cut *yángjīng* (羊经, sheep’s spinal cord) charcoal into blocks, each five *cùn* long and weighing two *liǎng*—six blocks total, known as *liùhé huǒ* (六合火, Six-Union Fire). Heat them red-hot, then level hot ash beneath the stand. Insert one red-hot charcoal block at the center, place the crucible atop, and cover it with more hot ash to a height of one *palm’s breadth* above the crucible. Position another iron stand three *fingers’ width* above, arranging the charcoal blocks in the *zi-wu-mao-you* (子午卯酉) directions, each three *fingers’ width* from the crucible. Add charcoal as needed.

On the first day, ignite the *zi-wu-mao-you* charcoal. On the second, use *chén-xū-chǒu-wèi* (辰戌丑未). On the third, use *yín-shēn-wèi-hài* (寅申巳亥). Repeat this cycle for seven days. Afterward, open the furnace and crucible, remove the silver lumps, and wash them with *zàojiǎo tāng* (皂角汤, soapberry decoction) until clean. Boil them in *wūméi tāng* (乌梅汤, black plum decoction) to whiten them. Set aside and extract the nurtured *língshā* blocks, which should now be uniformly black-green inside and out—this indicates successful nurturing. If red remains, the fire-nurturing was incomplete; reseal and refire as before. If the red is faint, nurture for an additional day; if deep, nurture for two. Only when uniformly black-green should the blocks be placed in a bright furnace, melted into liquid, and poured into a silver-melting mold to form ingots. If the melt is too viscous, pour it immediately as the *língshā* begins to liquefy—delay risks vapor loss.

Cut the solidified *língshā* into thumb-sized blocks, soak them in *gāncǎo tāng* (甘草汤, licorice decoction), and dry them. These are now *yǒngquán kuàng* (涌泉匮, Springwell Crucibles).

---
Nine: Clean the fire-nurturing crucible’s interior with borax solution, dry it, and reinforce the handles with iron wire as before. Seal the exterior with *liùyī ní* and dry it thoroughly. Place the *yǒngquán kuàng* (Springwell Crucible) head inside, centered. For each *kuàngtóu* (匮头, Crucible Head) weighing four *liǎng*, use one *liǎng* of mercury. If the head is ten *liǎng*, use two *liǎng* and a half of mercury. Seal the top with *kūnlún zhǐ*, cover with the crucible lid, bind the seam, and reinforce the exterior with *liùyī ní* before drying.

Nurture with *huǒshuǐwèijì* (火水未济, Fire-Water Uncompleted) method. Place a small jar at the ash pit’s base, filling it with eight *fēn* of water—do not overfill. Surround it with damp earth, leveling it to the jar’s rim. Cover the jar’s mouth with a brick, piercing a small hole the size of a tendon at its center. Position the fire-nurturing crucible over the hole and ignite five *wǔfāng huǒ* (五方火, Five-Direction Fire) charcoal blocks—each five *cùn* long and two *liǎng* heavy—three *fingers’ width* from the crucible. Place another stand three *fingers’ width* above, arranging two *liǎng* of red-hot charcoal horizontally and four blocks vertically, as before, following directional alignment. Seven days of fire suffice. Remove the crucible: the mercury will have dried, hardened like teeth, and formed a precious substance. If oil-like mercury remains, the fire was insufficient—nurture for two more days.

---
Ten: **Rich Noble Seal (Fùguì Guān)**
Take one *liǎng* of dry *gǎnshā* (乾汞砂, dry mercury sand), wrap it in three *qián* of fine silver foil, and smoke it in a bright furnace to form a treasure, which may be shaped as desired.

**Lead-Yellow Seal (Qiānhuáng Guān, also called Jīnhuá Guān)**
Use fifty *liǎng* of high-quality *jiànkāng huángdān* (建康黄丹, Huangdan from Jiankang), mixed with fresh ginger juice to a thick paste. Dry it and place it in a silver-melting pan, covering with a tile. Heat until the mixture liquefies, then pour it onto a stone to form *tànqiān* (探铅, lead exploration)—the yellow flowers will appear at the center while the edges and base remain leaden. Once cooled, grind the yellow flowers finely, purify them with water, and use as sealing medicine. For each *liǎng* of mercury sand, apply one *liǎng* of yellow flowers, cover, and smoke until liquefied. Pour into a mold, seal the medicine within, and cool to reveal a supreme treasure. The sealing medicine may be reused—this is the **Lead-Yellow Seal (Qiānhuáng Guān)**, also called **Golden Flower Seal (Jīnhuá Guān)**, of great efficacy.

---
**Supplement to Crucible Methods**
The Crucible Head is called *Chángshēng* (长生, Eternal Life). When its nurturing power is exhausted and it can no longer dry mercury, apply crushed *fēngwō sū* (蜂窝酥, honeycomb sugar) to reinforce its potency.

**Great Rescue Method, Small Rescue Method, Leading Grandson Method, True Death Sulfur Reunion with Crucible Head Method, Black Mass Nurturing Black Mass Method, and Crystal Flower Gushing Snow Method**—these ensure continuous mercury infusion without rest, achieving boundless eternal life.

**Leading Grandson Method (Gōng Lǐngsūn Fǎ):**
For each standard Crucible Head of ten *liǎng*, use one *liǎng* of previously cooked *língshā* (nurtured mercury sand), formed into blocks, cleansed, and placed beside the Crucible Head within. Pour mercury over it and nurture for seven days as before. If internal redness persists, extend the nurturing in subsequent cycles without interruption—the firmer, the better. The resulting product may also be smoked, melted, and recast into Crucible Heads, prolonging their lifespan indefinitely. Mercury application follows the original ratio.

**True Death Method (Zhēn Sǐ Fǎ):**
Take eight *qián* of *língshā* blocks, adding two *qián* of dead sulfur, melting them together with a Crucible Head into a liquid, then pouring and casting into Crucible Heads for nurturing.

**Black Mass Nurturing Black Mass Method (Wū Tuán Yǎng Wū Tuán Fǎ), also called the Great Rescue Method (Dà Jiù Fǎ):**
For every four *liǎng* of Crucible Head, use one *liǎng* of previously cooked *língshā* as the ratio. If the Crucible Head weighs twenty *liǎng*, nurture five *liǎng*. After seven days with sufficient fire, open the cold furnace to reveal a green-black hue. If the fire is strong, transfer to a bright furnace, refining into liquid and ingots, then casting into blocks for Crucible Heads—without adding mercury—before recycling into new Crucible Heads.

**Crystal Flower Gushing Snow Method (Qióng Huā Yǒng Xuě Fǎ):**
Use one *liǎng* of green vitriol and one *liǎng* of mercury, boiling with one fresh *yáozi* (possibly *Ziziphus jujuba*) in half a bowl of water until no sand forms. Add more water and boil until sand appears, then stop. For ten *liǎng* of sand, use a large new iron pot, ten *liǎng* of vitriol, and boil until sand forms. Wash the vitriol away with salted plum juice, dry with thick paper, then boil the sand with mulberry ash juice to resist fire. Place in a *Yǒng Quán* Crucible and nurture with fire for seven days. Open the cold furnace to reveal the treasure. It may be used as a *guān zào* (sealing furnace) or as a mother substance to nurture *língshā* into Crucible Heads. If no *dān tóu* (cinnabar) is used, follow the silver-smelting method in an ash pit, refining with lead into an ingot. For the previous methods of pouring and washing sand, divide three *qián* into this portion to create a fully refined substance.

**Black *Língshā* Arsenic Method (Hēi Língshā Pí):**
For those who understand clearly, use five *liǎng* of *fǔzi* (possibly *Aconitum carmichaelii*), half a *jīn* each of fresh ginger and garlic, and forty-nine *cǎo má* (possibly *Cannabis sativa*) seeds (hulls removed), all crushed. Store in a clay bottle with river water, then suspend the arsenic in a silk pouch and boil with *wǔ-wu* (civil-military) fire for three *fú* periods. Dry the arsenic, add two or four *liǎng* of mercury, and refine until no stars remain. Place in a crucible, seal, and calcine with ten *jīn* of charcoal using the *língshā* method at low fire. Open the crucible, suspend the substance again, and boil with goat-hoof root for one *fú* period. For every two *liǎng* of red substance, add one *qián* and five *fēn* of the drug, then two *qián* of silver to form an instrument.

**First Pool (Dì Yī Chí):**
Soak red silk in *rénzhōng huáng* (human-centered yellow, possibly orpiment) for seven days—the more, the better.

**Second Pool (Dì Èr Chí):**
Grind *bànxià* (Pinellia), *nánxīng* (Arisaema), *dāngguī* (Angelica), *máhuáng* (Ephedra), *rǔxiāng* (frankincense), and *mòyào* (myrrh) into a powder, then soak in white wine dregs. Melt the previous red substance into a liquid and pour it in. Once cooled, proceed to the third pool.

**Third Pool (Dì Sān Chí):**
Use *zhìlíng fèn* (Oriole dung), *shùguā* (wax gourd) juice, and garlic vinegar, adding leeks. Add another pool with filtered crane oil—if collected, use crane fat. Other oils like red goose oil or mineral oil may also be used.

**Alternative Method:**
Boil one *liǎng* of red substance with rice vinegar, add three *qián* of *lú* (possibly *Aloe*), and three *fēn* of *páo* (parched), then grind into a powder. If the red substance is watery, add five doses and refine into ingots. Burn with alum powder five times, boil in alum water for three periods, then burn until slightly black. Finally, boil in single-plum water for three periods, first adding three *qián* of the mother substance with heavy use.

**Incantation:**
*"Heaven’s radiance descends swiftly, the River King’s adamantine descends swiftly.
Heaven’s wheels turn swiftly, Earth’s wheels turn swiftly—
Sun, moon, mountains, and rivers all turn swiftly.
Humans turn, ghosts turn, cold forests and trees all transform and turn—
All things hear and turn swiftly.

The Sacred Crucible’s eternal life-giving *Yǒng Quán* Crucible Method."*

「Cinnabar from the Chen Cloth (*Chén Jǐn*) one *jīn*, and sulfur from the ship (*pó shàng liú huáng*) two *liǎng*—mix the two into uniform granules. Store them in a bag sewn with hemp cloth (*mǎ wěi luó*). Use two *dòu* of mulberry twig ash lye (*sāng chái huī zhī*), suspend the crucible within the pot, and boil for three *qī* days and seven nights. Do not let it touch the pot’s bottom.

When the lye is nearly exhausted, replenish with hot lye, keeping the fire moderate—always boil with a gentle, fish-scale-like simmer. When the allotted days are complete, take one granule of the medicine and burn it red over flame to test. If no smoke appears, it has undergone *fú huǒ* (subduction by fire). Only then may it be stored in the *kuàng* (alchemical vessel) for nurturing.

**Nurturing Method:**
Take an iron or magnetic crucible (*hé*), large enough to hold half a *shēng* of liquid. Heat the crucible with fire, then coat its exterior with the natural juice of fresh ginger (*shēng jiāng*) while still warm. Next, rub it with salt and vinegar (*yán cù*), and let it dry thoroughly before use.

**Storage Method (*Kuàng Fǎ*):**
Use one *jīn* of mountain and marsh mercury (*shān zé yín*), ground into powder, or half of it formed into granules (*zhūzi*). Spread this over the crucible’s base. Then layer the earlier cinnabar granules atop the mercury powder. Cover with four *liǎng* of high-quality *wú tóu* (unheaded) powder (*liáng wú tóu mò*), and place a sheet of Kunlun paper (*kūn lún zhǐ*) as a separator. Fill the rest with moistened yellow earth (*rùn huáng tǔ*), tamp it down to ensure fullness, and seal it tightly with a lid. Mix vinegar and honey (*cù mì*) to coat the seam of the red stone pitch (*chì zhī*), ensuring the mouth is sealed with honey. Secure with an iron wire in a cross pattern (*shí zì shuān*), and coat the entire crucible with *guàn ní* (alchemical cement) to a thickness of half an inch. Parch and dry it in the sun before placing it in the furnace for nurturing.

**Furnace Method (*Lú Fǎ*):**
Dig a pit in the ground (*zhēn dì*), one *chǐ* five *cùn* deep and one *chǐ* four *cùn* in diameter. Burn it dry, then line the bottom with clean mulberry twig ash (*jìng sāng chái huī*), four finger-widths thick.

**Subduction by Fire Method (*Fú Huǒ Fǎ*):**
Layer four *liǎng* of firewood (*huǒ*) atop the crucible’s lid. Cover with hot ash, ensuring the flame does not extinguish. Use grass to test the fire—if it goes out, add more fuel immediately. Add fresh fire during the *mǎo yǒu* (morning and evening) periods, twice daily. Nurture the fire thus for seven days, then increase the fuel to half a *jīn* and nurture for another two *qī* days. Next, add a full *jīn* of firewood for three *qī* days. When the fire is fully sustained, add another *jīn* and let it burn for half a day. Remove the clean ash, then place ten *jīn* of charcoal (*tàn*) atop the crucible to burn the remaining fuel. Once cooled, open the crucible and separate the cinnabar granules from the mercury powder. The dead mercury (*sǐ gǒng*) will resemble black iron or charred residue, with dry, intense patterns on its surface—this is its maturation. If any granules retain a red or purple hue, they have not yet undergone full subduction by fire (*wú fú huǒ*). Return them to the vessel, nurture with one *jīn* of firewood for five or seven days, and test again. Once fully subdued, take one granule and test it over intense flame. If it burns red like a boiling liquid, it is perfect. If slight smoke appears, it has not yet been fully subdued by fire; return it to the vessel and nurture for another five to seven days until fully subdued.

Then take the fully subdued cinnabar granules and place them in a sweet crucible (*gān guō*), melting them into liquid in a wind furnace (*fēng lú*). If the mercury content is minimal, pour the liquid into the crucible and use a probe (*tàn zǐ*) to stir. If the cinnabar is abundant, cast it into a *dǐng* (alchemical cauldron). Use mountain and marsh mercury to fashion a lid; for every *jīn* of mercury in the cauldron, add half a *jīn* of mercury. Coat the entire cauldron with *guàn ní*, not requiring great thickness. Place it in the furnace, and beneath it, use half a *jīn* of prepared firewood to nurture for three *fú* periods (*sān fú shí*). If using half a *jīn* of firewood daily, when the allotted days are complete, open the cauldron and remove the dry mercury (*gān gǒng*). Test it over flame—if no smoke appears, it is marvelous. Then place it back in the wind furnace and pour it into ingots (*dìng zǐ*) for use. If casting into a cauldron is difficult, follow the earlier probe method, storing it within the crucible and nurturing as before.

**Alchemical Method for Refining Mercury (*Diān Shā Fǎ*):**
To remove the dross (*fēn qì*) from cinnabar and mercury, place the cinnabar in a sweet crucible and melt it into liquid. Add five *wú* (husked) hemp seed shells (*cǎo má zi*), then pour in mercury liquid once, followed by half a *liǎng* of saltpeter (*xiāo shí*), repeating this process five to seven times. The mercury liquid should resemble a mirror’s surface before refining into yellow. If pouring is desired, dross separation is unnecessary.

**Immortal Daoist Nurturing of the Dao/Way (*Shén Xiān Yǎng Dào Shù*):**
Cinnabar, cinnabar—its essence is naturally immortal (*zì rán bù sǐ*). If one’s *qì* is weakened, blood is dissipated, body is exhausted, and bones are withered, the alchemical work of entering stone (*rù shí zhī gōng*) can slightly restore vitality. For those who seek longevity, eternal youth, preservation of life, and tranquility of spirit, cinnabar must be ingested.

Moreover, when entering stone and encountering fire, all is reduced to ash. But cinnabar, after subduction by fire, transforms into yellow mercury (*huáng yín*), capable of being heavy or light, refined or spiritualized, blackened or whitened, darkened or illuminated. A single *hú* (bushel) of it cannot be lifted by a person’s strength. Ten thousand *jīn* of it, when met with fire, ascends swiftly and lightly.

Ghosts and spirits seek it in vain, knowing not its whereabouts. If *mǎ yá xiāo* (saltpeter), saltpeter (*xiāo shí*), or grass are used for subduction, the weight remains unchanged, and all metals—gold, silver, copper, iron—become pliable, while hard substances soften instantly.

**Space Green (*Kōng Qīng*):**
Long-term ingestion of *kōng qīng* (space green) lightens the body, prevents aging, and keeps one from forgetfulness. It elevates the spirit, transforms one’s essence, and can refine copper, iron, lead, and tin into gold. In regions like Sichuan’s *Yìzhōu Shān Gǔ* (Benefit State Mountains and Valleys) and *Yuè Ruì Shān* (Jade Beauty Mountain) where copper is heavy, *kōng qīng* grows within. Its belly is hollow, and it is harvested year-round, especially in mid-March.

**Former Green (*Zēng Qīng*):**
Long-term ingestion of *zēng qīng* (former green) lightens the body, prevents aging, and can refine gold and copper. It grows in Sichuan’s mountains and valleys, as well as in *Yuè Ruì*, and is harvested year-round.

Additionally, it is said: When refining *zēng qīng* (former green) without dross (*bù jiā qì*), or when working with copper green (*tóng qīng*), if one *liǎng* of material is used, gather *zǐ bèi tiān kuí* (purple-backed celestial cabbage), *gān cǎo* (licorice root), and *qīng zhī cǎo* (blue-green herb), each in equal dry and moist portions of one *yǐn* (two *liǎng*). Grind them finely and place in a sweet crucible. Add one *yǐn* of *zēng qīng* and two *yǐn* of flowing water, along with the other herbs. Simmer slowly for five days and nights, ensuring the water and fire are not lost. Once complete, remove it and rinse with flowing water. Then place it in a mortar (*rǔ niǎo*) and grind into powder for use.

It is also said: Former green (*zēng qīng*) and subduction by fire create cinnabar (*liàn shā*), the birthplace of *jīn qì* (metallic *qi*).

It is further said: If former green (*zēng qīng*) is kept in the fire and becomes a paste (*chéng gāo*), the paste can immediately refine mercury into silver (*zhuǎn dé yín*), yielding eight *dàn* (piculs) of product.»

Realgar, when combined with copper, can produce gold. It is also called *Goldstone Food* (*jīn shí shí*), or some say it is the "seedling of gold" (*jīn zhī miáo*).

It is further said: If realgar is subdued by herbs and refined into a liquid (*chéng zhī*), its inherent color remains unchanged. If one adds the liquid of refined realgar to other medicines, it can be ingested, but it can only transmute copper into silver (*diǎn tóng chéng yín*), not silver into gold. Orpiment, when subdued by fire, retains its inherent color, and when its shell is melted into liquid, it can transmute silver into gold and copper into silver.

The *Xìn Rén* text states: If orpiment is subdued by herbs and fire, its inherent color remains unchanged, and when its shell is melted into liquid, it can transmute copper into silver. However, if the quality appears dry (*zhì kū*), it is unfit for use.

Lead oxide (*qiān hēi*) and lead herb (*qiān cǎo*), when subdued, become a treasure (*chéng bǎo*), capable of transmuting copper into silver (*diǎn tóng wéi yín*). It can also be cast into tripods (*zhú zuò dǐng*), nurturing cinnabar (*zhūshā*) to retain its fire, and quicksilver (*shuǐ yín*) to withstand fire, as well as refining powdered frost (*duǎn fěn shuāng*).

As for gold filings (*jīn xiè*), there are twenty types of gold-bearing substances: Realgar gold (*xiónghuáng jīn*), orpiment gold (*cíhuáng jīn*), former green gold (*zēng qīng jīn*), sulfur gold (*liúhuáng jīn*), water gold (*shuǐ zhōng jīn*), raw iron gold (*shēng tiě jīn*), refined iron gold (*shú tiě jīn*), raw copper gold (*shēng tóng jīn*), *shūshí* gold (*shūshí jīn*), *lùshā* gold (*lùshā jīn*), *mǔshā* gold (*mǔshā jīn*), white tin gold (*báixī jīn*), black lead gold (*hēiqiān jīn*), cinnabar gold (*zhūshā jīn*), and the first fifteen of these are genuine. Only *stillborn gold* (*huán dàn jīn*), water gold (*shuǐ zhōng jīn*), *child gold* (*zǐ jīn*), *green bran gold* (*qīng fú jīn*), and *grass sand gold* (*cǎo shā jīn*) are true gold; the rest are all false.

Cinnabar (*zhūshā*), when subdued by herbs and fire, does not shatter and can transmute other substances into gold filings (*wéi wǔ jīn zéi*), but if it is subdued by mineral medicines and ash-frost (*guī fěn shuāng*), it is unfit for use.

It is further said: The white realgar of *Northern Court* (*Běi Tíng*), when refined, is called *gold thief* (*jīn zéi*), capable of refining all other medicines, causing them to self-produce realgar and orpiment. It is also used as a soldering agent (*jié yào*), particularly with borax (*péngshā*) for soldering gold and silver.

Alum stone (*fán shí*), which can transmute iron into copper, and black realgar (*hēi cíhuáng*), also called *chicken dung alum* (*jīshǐ fán*), are not used in medicines but only for coating, to blend with refined copper. When placed in bitter wine (*kǔ jiǔ*) and applied to iron, it turns into a copper hue, though its core remains unchanged.

Lampblack oil (*qīng yóu*) can soften all copper and iron.

Stone gall (*shí dǎn*), when refined and ingested, prevents aging, and prolonged consumption increases longevity and grants immortality (*jiāng shòu shénxiān*). It can also transmute copper into gold and silver. It is also called *bìshí*, *hēishí*, *tónglè*, or *mùshí*.

Stone sulfur (*shí liúhuáng*) can transmute gold, silver, copper, iron, and other strange substances. It can be decocted into liquid, poured into molds to create vessels, and also appears in a yellowish hue like *ézi* (a type of sulfur).

The *Daoist Method* (*xiānfāng*) for yellow cinnabar (*huáng zhūshā*) can destroy the five metals (*wǔ jīn*), but it can also create a golden hue. In general, do not use green-red or half-white-half-green, half-red-half-black substances, nor those that have already been transmuted into gold filings (*yǐ jīn liǎng*).

Substances with a pure yellow hue, internally lustrous like life itself (*nèi yíng zhì sì wùmìng*), are precious. For use, take four *liǎng* (one *yǐn*), first with one *liǎng* of *dragon-tail artemisia* (*lóngwěi hāo*) natural juice, two *liǎng* of flowing water, and one *liǎng* of *purple-backed borago* (*zǐbèi tiānhuī*) juice, along with the juice of *xùsuì* (*xùsuì zǐ*) fresh stems. Combine these four ingredients in a crucible (*A kǒu*), stir thoroughly until uniform, and seal with *liùyī ní* (a type of clay). Beneath, place crushed sulfur (*liúhuáng suì*), then pour into the pot. Using the previous liquid medicine, gradually add fire, stirring as it cooks until the liquid is exhausted.

Next, take ten *liǎng* of *bǎibù* (*bǎibù mò*), two *jīn* of *liǔbàng* (*liǔbàng mò*), and two *jīn* of *yīcuì cǎo* (*yīcuì cǎo mò*), finely ground. Mix with flowing water and the other medicines, then cook the sulfur powder for one *fú* (a period of time, roughly a day). Remove all the medicines, take out the refined sulfur, and wash it with refined *Gān Cǎo* (*shú gāncǎo táng*). Grind it in a mortar for twenty thousand strokes before use. When it encounters the five metals, it turns black; when it encounters quicksilver, it turns red.

It is further said: Sulfur (*liúhuáng*), also called *General* (*jiāngjūn*), has the power to break evil (*pò xié*). Quicksilver (*shuǐ yín*) can neutralize the poisons of gold, silver, copper, and tin, and transmute them back into cinnabar (*huán fù wéi dān*). Prolonged consumption grants immortality and prevents death (*jiāng shòu shénxiān bù sǐ*). It is also called *gǒng* (mercury), and it can dissolve and transmute gold and silver into mud, which people use to coat objects (*rú rén yǐ duò wù shì yě*).

When transmuted back into cinnabar (*huán fù wéi dān*), it is further said: First, use the natural juice of *purple-backed borago* (*zǐbèi tiānhuī*) and *night jasmine* (*yèjiāo téng*), cooking them together for one *fú*, causing their poisons to subside naturally. If refining ten *liǎng*, use seven *liǎng* of each juice, thoroughly mixing them as sufficient.

It is further said: Quicksilver congeals when mixed with lead, solidifies when mixed with sulfur, but disperses when ground with date flesh (*zhǎo ròu*). Another method: crush it into greasy powder (*pò wéi ní fěn*), then grind the powdered frost (*fěn shuāng*) with saliva and dead lice (*sǔn*). When applied to copper, it makes it lustrous (*tóng dé zhī zhì míng*); when poured into a corpse (*guàn shī zhōng*), the corpse does not decay (*shī fú wú*). When placed upon gold, silver, copper, or iron, it causes them to float (*shì fú*). If mixed with *purple deer antler* (*zǐhé chē*), it sinks (*dé zhī fú*). The method for applying to hair is as follows:

Take seven *qiān* of red hair (*chì máo*) and three *qiān* of human hair (*rén máo*), melt them open, and gradually apply the medicine. Pour it entirely into the oil slot (*yóu cáo*), take it out and crush it, resulting in a tea-colored red (*chá tóu hóng*). If the previous medicine is insufficient, add another *qiān* or half-*qiān* of it, melt again, stir uniformly, and pour back into the slot. Taking it out and crushing it yields a tea-colored green, which is ideal.

For use in *Fēngkuì* (a type of alchemical vessel), crush the medicine with three to five or ten new bricks (*xīn zhuān*), place it into a pot (*fàng rú guō nèi*), and extract its medicinal aroma (*yào qì wèi lái*). Pour it back into the slot, crush it, and observe the result. Add three to four *qiān* of silver (*yín*), stir well, and pour into a plum water pot (*méi shuǐ guō*) to cook, the more the better.

If done quickly, use two *qiān* of *língshí* (a type of mineral) and one *qiān* of white alum (*bái fán*), crushed and mixed with water. Apply it to the substance, heat it until red, take it out, and scrub with charcoal ash (*tàn huī*). Wash clean and return it to the plum water pot to cook white. Then apply the previous alum again and heat it, repeating this process for the best results.

Another method: First, cook the base silver (*méi shāo dǐ yín*) with three *qiān* of clear alum (*qīng fán*), seven *qiān* of *shí líng* (a type of mineral), and three *qiān* of *bǎibù*, thoroughly ground and mixed with water like paste (*rú hù*). Apply it three times with great fire, then cook it in plum water (*hòu rù méi*). Rinse with diluted plum water three times before applying the medicine and heating. Then cook it in plum water three times in total.

Take one *liǎng* of red hair, hammered into either a square or round shape, and half a *qián* of base silver (*dǐ yín*), cut into pieces. Mix two *fēn* of powdered borax (*fēi guò páng shā*) evenly and apply it to the hair, then heat the base silver until it melts and blends into the hair. Hammer the mixture smooth, reapply the previous substance, and again heat it thoroughly. Once fully refined, immerse it in the plum water pot (*méi guō*) to cook white—repeating this process yields the best results.

For one *liǎng* of gold, use two *fēn* of white alum (*bái fán*), one *fēn* of green vitriol (*zào fán*), twelve *fēn* of saltpeter (*yàn xiāo*), and two *fēn* of salt. Apply the refined plum water mixture (*jīng méi*) to the gold, heat it until the surface turns black, then plunge it into water and reheat. Scrub vigorously with a brush until the blackness is removed—repeating this process improves the result.

For one *fēn* of gold and one *fēn* of mercury (*shuǐ yín*), grind them together in the palm until they form a paste, then apply this to a piece of *yúo shí* (a type of mineral stone), heat it red-hot, and hammer it into a square or round shape. If the paste remains, reapply, reheat, and finally cook it in plum water.

**Master Yuánzhēn Dòngyángzǐ** remarked:
*"The above four methods are merely the playful arts of the immortals. They may serve in desperate circumstances, but one must not rely on them as a primary practice—lest they mislead others and harm one’s virtuous intentions. Those who attain enlightenment should ponder this."*

「The Method of Boiling Glue: Take deer antlers in any quantity. First, place them in a clay pot filled with water and soak for three days, then drain. Wash them with sand from the river until their yellow color appears.

Next, take a piece of lead about two *cùn* long, rinse with fresh river water, and soak in the pot for three days. Use a large covered clay bowl. Mix *guàn* clay (a type of waterproofing mud) with aged *bì* soil (a type of earth) to form a paste to seal the bowl. According to the size of the bowl, fashion a stopper (*áo*).

Pour the water from the second soaking into the bowl, then add the deer antlers and boil. Continuously heat water in an iron pot and pour it before the stopper. If the water in the bowl decreases by one *cùn*, replenish it by one *cùn*—never add cold water, only pure *lì* charcoal. For three days and nights, the fire must never cease; boil until the antlers are fully softened. On the fourth day at dawn, drain the liquid and, while still hot, scrape off the skin to obtain deer antler glue (*lùjiǎo shuāng*).

The remaining broth in the bowl must be simmered until it thickens to one-tenth of its original volume. Pour it through a bamboo tube and hang it in a cold, shaded place—it will solidify by the next morning. Break open the bamboo tube, shape the residue into lead cakes (*qiān bǐngzǐ*), and store them.

Another Method of Boiling Glue: Deer antlers—whether freshly dead or not, in any quantity, about three *cùn* in length—should be cut and the outer skin removed. Soak the antler shavings in river water for seven days, changing the water daily until the antlers are thoroughly washed. Boil them in a pot. For every five *jīn* of antlers, use half a *jīn* of *sāngbái* bark (mulberry bark), one *jīn* of *chùshízi* (paper mulberry fruit), two *liǎng* of imported *liúhuáng* (sulfur), and two *liǎng* of *zhūshā* (cinnabar). Boil them together. When the water is exhausted, add more broth. By the time of one *fú* (a period of two hours), the antlers will naturally soften. If the fire is not allowed to stop and they remain unsoftened, boil them again for one *fú*. Once softened, cool them and remove the antlers, then hang them in a well-ventilated place to dry. Filter the deer antler broth to remove all the herbs, then simmer it slowly over low heat to obtain glue (*jiāo*).

The Method of Pill-making: For each *jīn* of medicine, use one *jīn* of honey as a binder, mixed with flour paste. For every four *liǎng* of powdered medicine, use four *liǎng* of the drug and one *liǎng* of rice flour.

Another Boiling Method: Use two pots, always keeping warm broth ready for replenishing. Lead and Mercury, from the *Jiǎ Gēng* to the *Bǎo Jí* collection, Volume One complete. Lead and Mercury, from the *Jiǎ Gēng* to the *Bǎo Jí* collection, Volume Two complete. The Ninefold Great Elixir of *Xūyuán* (Void Source), Cinnabar and Silver Method—First Transformation.»

「Take one and a half *liǎng* of fine powdered **Cinnabar** (*zhūshā*). Use one *liǎng* of **Mercury** (*gǒng*), grinding them together until thoroughly mixed. Wrap with cotton, suspend in **slaked lime** (*huánghuā* or *xiūhuáng* **quicklime** *shíjiāng* **suspension**), and add one *liǎng* of powdered **Coptis** (*huánglián* or *qiānghuā* **Coptis** *qiānghuā*), boiling for one *fú* period. Remove and set aside, then mix with **honey** to form a paste of **Coptis**, **Aconite** (*cǎowū*), **Arisaema** (*tiānnánxīng*), and fresh **Rheum** (*dìyú*) leaves, as thick as a finger. Further add **realgar** (*bái yǒu*) and **orpiment** (*bái bì*), with **pepper** (*biāo*) powder—adjust to taste. Mix with **egg white** (*jīzǐ qīng*), then wrap once more. Place in a container, cover with **realgar** powder, seal the cracks with **oyster shell powder** (*bàngfěn*) mixed with oil, and store in an **earthenware or porcelain vessel** (*wǎ cí*). Nurture with heat for seven days.

On the first and second days, use one *liǎng* of fire. From the third to the fourth days, use four *liǎng* of fire. On the fifth and sixth days, use six *liǎng* of fire. On the seventh day, use one *jīn* of fire. After one day of destruction by fire, wait until it cools, then remove—this is the completion of the **First Transformation**.

**Second Transformation:** Use two *liǎng* of **Mercury**, following the prior method of binding with **Cinnabar** and boiling the medicine, as done before. Place in the container, nurturing for another seven days. On the first and second days, use one *liǎng* of fire. From the third to the fourth days, use four *liǎng* of fire.»

Five days and six days, use six *liǎng* of fire.
Seven days and eight days, use eight *liǎng* of fire.
Nine days and ten days, use ten *liǎng* of fire.
Eleven days and twelve days, use twelve *liǎng* of fire.
Thirteen and fourteen days, use thirty *liǎng* of fire.

**Third Transformation:** Use two *liǎng* of Mercury, following the prior method of binding with Cinnabar and boiling, then sealing and nurturing with fire for another three sevens of days.
On the first and second days, use one *liǎng* of fire.
From the third to the fourth days, use four *liǎng* of fire.
On the fifth and six days, use six *liǎng* of fire.
Seven days and eight days, use eight *liǎng* of fire.
Nine days and ten days, use ten *liǎng* of fire.
Eleven and twelve days, use twelve *liǎng* of fire.
Thirteen and fourteen days, use thirty *liǎng* of fire, nurturing until completion.

**Fourth Transformation:** Take the original Cinnabar, weigh its quantity, and measure an equal amount of Mercury. Following the previous method, boil and bind, then place in fire to nurture for three sevens of days, and remove.

Take a new Cinnabar container, lay ten *liǎng* of bright Cinnabar (*guāngmíng shā*) inside, and seal the container with honey-mixed [illegible] powder. On the exterior, use egg white to mix with fine ink and seal the body. Then, use the prior medicine to seal the White Tiger [medicine], covering it with the prior medicine—this is the method of securing the Cinnabar.

Place the sealed container inside, mix shell powder with oil to seal the seams, and place it in a fire pot with three *jīn* of fire. Nurture for forty-nine days to completion.

**Fifth Transformation:** Take five *liǎng* of *míngchuāng chén* (window dust), which is the refined Cinnabar. Following the prior method of layering Cinnabar, add five *liǎng* of sulfur, and after seven days, remove—sulfur can now subdue Mercury.

**Sixth Transformation:** Take five *liǎng* of the medicine, layer with Orpiment (*qīhuáng*), seal, and nurture for seven days to subdue Mercury into *gēng* (a refined state).

**Seventh Transformation:** Take the powdered Cinnabar from the sixth transformation, layer with Realgar (*xiónghuáng*), seal, and nurture for seven sevens of days—this can transmute iron into *gēng*.

**Eighth Transformation:** Take the powdered Cinnabar from the seventh transformation, form pills with *chǔ* (ramie) juice the size of millet grains. Each pill, swallowed with water, can prolong life and align one with the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

**Ninth Transformation:** Take the Cinnabar from the seventh transformation, layer with ten *liǎng* of arsenic (*pí*), and nurture for seven days—this can transmute the five metals into supreme treasures.

**The Supreme Ancestor’s Secret Prescription for Golden Elixir**
**Refining the Golden Elixir to Transform Metals and Stones**
The Supreme Ancestor’s Golden Sulfur Secret—transforming metals into treasures, nourishing endlessly.

It speaks of the Three Grades of Golden Elixir:
The First Grade of Golden Elixir—when taken, ascends to the Golden Palace of Heaven, named *Tiānxiān* (Celestial Immortal).
The Second Grade of Returning Elixir—when taken, grants longevity in this world.
The Third Grade of Spirit Elixir—transforms the five metals and eight stones into great treasures, benefiting the world and the self, named *Rénxiān* (Human Immortal).

Those who possess this art are called *Wánggōng* (Kings and Dukes).
Yet it must not be transmitted to the unworthy. Both the recipient and the transmitter will suffer great misfortune, and the medicine will fail.
Only those who benefit others and act with restraint may be taught.
Wasting such precious medicine will bring eternal damnation as a lowly ghost.
If one obtains the method but does not transmit it to the worthy, it is called *Yǐn Tiānbǎo* (Hidden Heavenly Treasure).
If transmitted to the unworthy, it is called *Xiè Tiānjī* (Leaking Heaven’s Secrets).
These are all forbidden, and they invite karmic retribution.
Practitioners must be cautious.

**Secret Prescription for Refining**
Take one *liǎng* and two *qián* of live *fǔjīn* (gold), and two *liǎng* of imported sulfur.
First, melt the gold into a liquid, cast it into ingots, grind into powder, and refine it to the finest consistency.
Take seven *qián* of gold powder, add two *qián* of sulfur, and grind together into a powder as fine as *mǐnyàn* (Indian myrobalan).

Take a small magnetic container that can hold all the medicine.
First, rub the container with ginger-ground ink three times, dry it, then place the gold-sulfur mixture inside, filling it halfway with a spoon. Use the remaining half-*liǎng* of gold powder to cover the top, sealing it tightly.
Cover with seven layers of vinegar-inked paper, then cover the top with white alum powder, level with the container’s rim, and seal with red stone pitch (*chìshízhī*).
Externally, grind magnetite and lodestone into powder, mix with egg white into a paste, and seal the white container securely.
Take another outer container, fill it with powdered *fúhuǒ yán* (buried salt), and place the small container inside. The space between the outer and inner containers should be no thicker than a finger.
Seal the outer container’s rim with red stone pitch and secure it with salt powder. Once dry, place it in an ash pot and nurture with three *liǎng* of fire for three days.
With six *liǎng* of fire, nurture for six days.
When reduced to ash, remove the outer container’s salt seal, open it, and take out the small white container. Also remove the medicine’s outer layer and the rim seal, blow away the black paper ash, and wipe the container clean on all sides.

Then, with a sharp knife, scrape the gold-sulfur mixture—it should resemble the color of *mìtuó sēng* (a Buddhist monk’s robe).
Weigh it as before: one *liǎng* and four *qián*.
Grind the gold-sulfur mixture again, take half-*liǎng* to cover the top, and place nine *qián* of gold-sulfur powder and two *qián* of raw sulfur into the container following the prior method. Seal the outer container as before, place it back in the ash pit, and follow the previous fire schedule by days.
Open the container, grind the mixture finely, and weigh it as before: one *liǎng* and six *qián*—the sulfur is now mostly subdued by fire.

Grind the gold-sulfur mixture again, add two *qián* of raw sulfur into the container, and cover the top with six *qián* of gold-sulfur powder. Seal it as before and nurture with fire according to the prior method until completion.
But add two *liǎng* of absolute sulfur—this is the limit.
If the container is small, switch to a larger one, following the method, totaling three *liǎng* and two *qián* of fire-subdued Supreme Ancestor’s elixir.

**Next: The Method of Nurturing Treasures**
Take small pieces of Cinnabar the size of beans.
First, use a clean, oil-free mortar, place the container’s powder inside, and add one *liǎng* of Cinnabar. Roast it slowly over low fire until it turns purple.

Let the container’s powder cool, then place it in the crucible. Shape the cinnabar into even pieces like my lotus seeds, seal it, and heat with three *liǎng* of fire for three days. Six *liǎng* of fire for seven days. Open the crucible—now the cinnabar resembles a violet-gold hue.

Grind it uniformly with the previous container’s powder, add two *liǎng* of mercury, and grind until no specks remain. Return it to the crucible, heat with four *liǎng* of fire, and nurture for seven days. Open the crucible, sift, and grind the mercury—this becomes the **Elixir of Longevity**.

If refining like **sifted grains** (i.e., *chén* method), use three *liǎng* of cinnabar, shaped into pieces like **lotus seeds** within the crucible. Layer the crucible’s powder over it, then add another layer of cinnabar, topped again with the crucible’s powder. Seal as before, place in the **ash pit**, and heat with four *liǎng* of fire for seven days. Open the crucible—the cinnabar, three *liǎng* in total, will appear grain by grain like gold, and the upper layer can be struck into sheets.

Follow this method precisely to refine twenty *liǎng* of gold. Take ten *liǎng* and process them in a **Seven Treasures furnace** to extract eight *liǎng* of true cinnabar-gold. Grind the remaining ten *liǎng* of cinnabar finely, mix uniformly with one *liǎng* of raw sulfur, seal it in the crucible, and place it in the ash pit. Nurture as before for seven days. Open the crucible, grind finely—the medicine may turn white, and the mercury will be transformed into true gold.

As before, place the gold crucible into the container’s powder without diminishing it. Scoop out the center to form a pit, pour in four *liǎng* of mercury, cover with the container’s powder, and seal with **red stone pitch**. Place in the ash pit, heat with four *liǎng* of fire for one **fire cycle** (*fú shí*), and a **golden furnace** will be formed.

This method must be carefully observed; there are also **oral precepts** (*kǒu jué*) that further guide its completion. One must have **virtue and merit** (*fúdé*)—only then will cultivation surely succeed. Those lacking virtue and merit may not refine this treasure.

Next: The Method of Entering the **Golden Furnace**
The **soft gold** (*ruǎn jīn*) has a method to be processed.

「Use two *qián* each of **green vitriol** (*bì fēn*) and **yellow vitriol** (*huáng fēn*), one *liǎng* each of **purple vitriol** (*zǐ fēn*) and **crimson vitriol** (*jiàng fēn*). Grind all four into fine powder with **fire-refined** (*fú*) methods. Take one *shēng* of vinegar, boil it with **goldfish scales** (*jīn yú mù*) until it bubbles, then heat a gold vessel until it turns red, and immerse it into the **flowering crucible** (*huā huī*). Apply gentle heat until the gold vessel glows like molten gold. While still hot, quickly immerse it into the vinegar bath—this will fix its red hue and make the yellow and purple radiance dazzling.

For each batch, use **plum soup** (*wū méi tāng*) to cleanse, wiping with black felt.

**Next: The Method of Moistening the Golden Crucible**
One *shēng* of **clear oil** (*qīng yóu*), one *jīn* each of **yellow cow fat** (*huáng niú zhī*) and **pork fat** (*dǔ zhī*), eight *liǎng* of **white nitre** (*bái xiāo shí*), and four *shēng* of urine. First, heat the oil until boiling, then add the cow fat and reduce it by six *fēn*. Add the urine, boil for over forty times, then introduce the **white nitre** (*bái xiāo*) and **raw natron** (*pò xiāo*). When it forms a liquid, immerse the gold vessel—it will be moistened with marvelous luster.

The **powdered crucible** (*huī mò*) method is detailed in the following section.

In general, all substances placed in the crucible undergo **yin suppression of yang** (*yīn zhì yáng*), and through **fire-refining** (*fú fāng*) they become supreme treasures. All **elixirs** (*dān*) are formed by first **yin-suppressing** (*yīn zhì*) to solidify the embryo, then **yang-refining** (*yáng fú*) to take shape.

If an elixir is **yang-refined** (*yáng fú*) to form its shape, it will be colorless. If only **yin-suppressed** (*yīn zhì*) to solidify, its hue will be dark. In essence, refining **gold and sulfur** (*jīn liú*) along with the **eight stones** (*bā shí*), one must first **yin-suppress** (*yīn fú*), then place in the **yang furnace** (*yáng lú*). This is a universal and wondrous method.

If **gold leaf** (*jīn piàn*) is mixed with **cinnabar** (*zhū shā*), it will turn into gold upon entering the crucible. If **silver foil** (*yín biè*) is mixed with cinnabar, it will become silver. Without the **mother substance** (*mǔ*), the **calcined product** (*bèi*) will naturally form a treasure. Even if a little mother is added, the calcined product will still be miraculous.

**The Method of Fire-Suppressed Vitriol**
Two *liǎng* of **sulfur** (*liú huáng*), two *liǎng* of **nitre** (*xiāo shí*), and three *qián* of **Aristolochia debilis** (*mǎ dòu líng*). Grind these into a powder, mix evenly, dig a pit, place the mixture in a jar, and level it with the ground.

Take a **fire-refined** (*fú*) fire block the size of a **prickly ash fruit** (*shān zhū*), wrap it with dough, and wait until smoke rises. Cover with four or five layers of damp paper, then seal with two square bricks, pressing down with an earthen mound. When cooled, remove it—the **sulfur** will remain intact.

For each three *liǎng* of **white vitriol** (*bái fēn*), mix with two *liǎng* of **fire-suppressed sulfur** (*fú huǒ liú huáng*) into a powder. Use a large **sweet crucible** (*dà gān huī*), place the mixture inside, and stir into a liquid. Pour it into a stone vessel—its color will be like jade.

**The Method of Fire-Suppressed Green Salt**
One *jīn* of **green salt** (*qīng yán*), placed in a sweet crucible with two *liǎng* of **mulberry twig ash** (*sāng yáo qiào*), will naturally form a liquid when mixed.

**The Method of the Nine-Precious Crucible**
**White lead** (*bái yǐ*), **white arsenic** (*bái yǒu*), glutinous rice, date flesh, **mulberry ash** (*sāng huǒ huī*), **white chalk** (*bái è zi*), and **red stone pitch** (*chì shí zhī*). Grind all into fine powder, mix with water to form a crucible paste, and dry it for use.

**Oral Transmission of the Secret Precept**
*The Lower Section of Daoist Alchemy: Transmuting Gold and Stone* says:
The **Supreme Sovereign** (*Tài Shàng*) teaches this gold-and-stone method to benefit the world and guide people, so they may know what can be cultivated—just as **alchemical techniques** (*shù*) have proven efficacy. It is not to command lifeless gold and stone to transform into supreme treasures.

If one cultivates and ingests this, it will prolong life and extend years—ah, the wonder! Yet few among later generations encounter it, while many do not. Those in high station covet fame and wealth, indulging in desires; those in lowly ranks are proud of deceit and trickery. Such people, though they meet this method, cannot cultivate it. Even if they attempt refinement, they cannot succeed—it is because they lack the **virtue and merit** (*fúdé*) to aid them.

Thus, the **Supreme Sovereign’s** sacred crucible method is truly what the **Supreme Sovereign** spoke of, sealed in the **Golden Crucible and Jade Casket** (*jīn huī yù hán*), unknown to the world. I impart this method to **Daoist adepts** (*yǒu dào zhī shì*), so they may transmit and uphold the **Supreme Sovereign’s** teachings, benefiting themselves and the world, nurturing life and refining treasures.

The **truly authentic** (*zhì zhēn*) adept bowed in reception, but even after the first cultivation, nothing succeeded, and all materials were wasted. Only then, before his teacher, did he receive the **oral precepts** (*kǒu jué*), a few words on fire and timing.

I then followed the method and precepts, and the crucible was cultivated successfully. Now, I reveal no more, lightly divulging the **Dao’s** mysteries. According to transmitted precepts and experience, if the cultivation exceeds the proper degree, the **inner and outer crucible** (*nèi wài huī*) paste and the **fire-suppressed** (*fú huǒ*) medicines must be carefully measured—do not let the proportions be uneven. If even a **hair’s breadth** (*háo lí*) is lost, the medicine will fail.

To refine, one must first select **numinous mountains and great rivers** (*míng shān dà chuān*), or a **pure hall** (*guān yǔ*), or a **cleansed chamber** (*jìng shì*). Only then can the medicine be safely placed. If the dwelling is in former **slaughterhouses** (*tú fáng*), **prisons** (*qiú yù*), **graves** (*fén mù*), **birth chambers** (*chǎn shì*), or places with lingering **corpses** (*fú shī*), **ghosts** (*guǐ mèi*), or frequented by **worldly feet** (*rén zú cháng dào*), the effort will be in vain—**the crucible cannot be set**.

**Next: The Method of Warding Off Demons**
Before setting the crucible, one must first observe **strict fasting** (*yán zhāi*), purify the chamber, and maintain **ritual cleanliness** (*jié jìng*) for three or seven days. Sacrifice and offer to the **local deities** (*shè jiào shén zhī*), and present the **Supreme Sovereign’s** true image. Then even **ghosts and demons** will come to guard and assist.

Daily, one must recite and meditate on **sutras** (*jīng*), never neglecting incense—this is the **primary essential** (*xiān yào*) for nurturing the medicine. One must not fail to know the method.

The method uses **yellow** (*huáng*), for it is the **dross of gold and stone** (*mǐ jīn*) freshly extracted from mountains and rivers, still retaining the **numinous qi** (*líng qì*) of heaven and earth—thus it can be refined and transformed. If one uses **matured gold** (*shú jīn*), it is a **tainted substance** (*chù è zhī wù*), unfit for the **great medicine** (*dà yào*).

Yet the method does not rely on other medicines for the crucible paste, using only **gold and sulfur**—for the **mother and child** (*zǐ mǔ*) can generate the **embryonic qi** (*huà zhī líng*). All **gold-liquid** (*xiāo jīn zhī*) and crucible-paste mixtures must use **new, unused materials** (*xīn wèi céng yòng zhě*).

When using vessels for the process, they must all be bathed in **frankincense water** (*rǔ xiāng shuǐ*), placed before the **sacred altar** (*shén shèng*), and set in a **pure chamber** (*jié jìng chǔ*). At the moment of placing the medicine, **chickens, dogs, women, and children** (*jī quǎn fù rén*) must not be present—this is a **great taboo** (*dà jì*).

The method must be kept in **deep secrecy** (*shēn mì*), and no **idle person** (*xián rén*) should know of it. One must also exercise **caution and reverence** (*jiè shèn*).

The method’s proportions must be **meticulously precise** (*fèn liàng zǐ xì*). If even a **hair’s breadth** (*háo lí*) is miscalculated, the medicine will **disperse and ruin** (*yào fēi huài*).」

The **gold and sulfur** must be ground as fine as **Myanmar lac**—if coarse, even two days of fire may not suffice to penetrate it.

For **solidifying the elixir**, one must proceed with meticulous care according to the method. First, dry the **vessel in the shade**, then dry it in the sun. If cracks or damage appear from wind, it must not be used. Only on an **auspicious day** may it be placed in the furnace.

When the text speaks of **"three measures of fire, nurtured for three days,"** it means three measures of fire for each **one *fúshí*** period. The rest follows this proportion.

Before combining the **vessel**, first place it in an **ash pit**, mixing the ash with **firewood ash and paper ash**, then tamp the ash firmly on all sides with a spoon. Use a **fire-tempered spatula** to seal the vessel’s opening—one *cùn* wide—ensuring the ash beneath is hollowed through. Then, when the fire is fully kindled, quickly cover the vessel’s mouth, seal it with ash, and ensure no wind leaks in or the fire extinguishes. If the fire lingers too long without transformation, examine the ash near the vessel—it must not be tightly packed, for if it is, the fire’s power will stagnate and retreat outward. The ash on all sides, however, must be firmly compacted.

If any impurity is introduced or the fire is mismanaged, the **sulfur will dissipate and be lost**. If the **vessel’s head is increased**, the sulfur will flee—measure the lost amount precisely, then supplement it according to the method, nurturing it again for the required days. Once the days are complete and the vessel is opened without fracture, proceed to add more sulfur, continuing until the desired quantity is achieved.

When introducing **cinnabar**, first place it in a **pure chamber**, measuring the amount to be immersed in water, then boil with **earth, horsehair, borax, and roasted sand** in gentle and fierce fires for one *fúshí* period before proceeding with the elixir’s preparation.

The method of **grinding the elixir** is difficult, yet this technique is swift and extraordinary—only cease when the **vessel is fully exhausted**, confirming its efficacy.

Then, according to the method, introduce **mercury**, taking four *liǎng* of the substance per *fúshí* period—this is the definitive measure.

When the substance first emerges, do not expose it to **violent winds**. Instead, first boil **black plum, wrapped gold, earth tiger, and eargrass** (each half a portion) with the substance in a stone vessel for one *fúshí* period, then transfer it to a **triple-fired pot** before use.

Now, lest these **secrets of the vessel and elixir head** be lost, I record them all for preservation as a **family treasure**, to be shown to none. Composed on the **3rd year of Yuanhe in the Great Tang, on the *jiǎzǐ* day of the *wùshēn* month**, by **Qīngxū Zǐ of Jīnhuā Cave**.

**First Transformation of the Nine-Turns Beyond-Dust Elixir**
*Poem follows:*

**First Transformation of the Nine-Turns Beyond-Dust Elixir (Continued)**

**Refinement of the Nine-Turn Elixir**
*Method:*
Take **three yellows** (rhubarb, scutellaria, and evodia), **two children** (bitter apricot kernel, soapberry), **guess-tooth** (soapberry), **blue wood**, and **winter wheat flower**, each ground into powder. Place in a **building cup**, layering with **cinnabar** (five *liǎng*), pressing firmly. Cover with a small cup, bind with iron wire in a cross, secure tightly, and dry.

Wrap in ash, bake with two *jīn* of fire until fully heated. Once cooled, remove the grass ash—now the cinnabar is black. Repeat this process four times, yielding twenty *liǎng* of warmed cinnabar.

Proceed to the next stage: for every two *liǎng* of lead, use one *liǎng* of arsenic. First, melt the lead in a **sweet crucible** into a liquid, then add **pistachio blocks** into the molten lead. When the smoke clears and the fire cools, break the pistachio-lead mass—lead forms the lower layer, pistachio the upper. Discard the lead; the arsenic, now **amber-red and translucent**, is retained.

Warm twenty *liǎng* of pistachio with twenty *liǎng* of cinnabar, grinding them evenly. Place in a sweet crucible, cover with a **glazed tile**, and heat in the furnace until red. Remove and cool in warm ash, then break open to reveal the cinnabar as a **precious mass**, like fresh silver—this is the **Green-Gold Head**.

The pistachio, now colorless, is discarded. This refined cinnabar is now called the **Green-Gold Head**.

*Poem:*
**Second Transformation: Cooking Lead into Black**
*"Smash the Green-Gold Head without doubt,
The primordial embryo simmers for two or three hours.
The medicinal spirit expels the yellow sprout’s breath,
Its efficacy divine—truly wondrous."*

*Method:*
Take **aconite, Sichuan pepper, alum, dragon bone, gallnut, licorice, magnetite, wolfsbane, arisaema needle, and sand** (ten herbs), steep in rice vinegar. Shape the Green-Gold Head into flakes, encase in raw silk, and suspend for **three days and nights of boiling**, then **one day of vigorous boiling**, washing three times to purge the lead essence. Then, form it into a **vessel**.

**Third Transformation: Green-Gold Vessel, Cinnabar Becomes Precious**
*Poem:*
*"The cinnabar, nurtured by hidden fire, is most praiseworthy,
Now formed as a vessel to foster the divine sand.
Layered within like a lotus, five days’ work—truly commendable."*

*Method:*
Grind the cooked Green-Gold cinnabar into powder, forming a vessel. Use **four *liǎng* of fire** at the **child and adult hours**, nurturing for five days until the lead essence is severed and the spirit awakens.

**Method for Warming Borax into Mother Sand (Attaching to the Body):**
Take **white peony, anemarrhena, and dendrobium**, burning them in a sweet crucible until blackened, then reddening. Add equal parts **borax**, melting into a liquid like jade. Moisten pure cinnabar with rice vinegar, then layer with **three-sevens mother sand** (in seven-to-three ratios), wrap in honey, and dust with pepper. Place inside the previous vessel, using the same fire regimen, nurturing for seven days. The extracted sand is now **iron-colored**, sufficient to form a *jīn* for the **Dan-Yang Vessel**, fostering the **spiritual sand**.

If not formed into a vessel, the lead can be refined into a precious mass of **eight *liǎng***.

**Fourth Transformation: Dan-Yang Vessel, Spiritual Sand Reveals the Precious**
*Poem:*
*"Nurtured cinnabar can transmute the bones,
Speak truly—creation refines the spiritual sand.
Seven days in the furnace yields an immortal form,
If it meets the lead pool, it’s called Snow Flower."*

*Method:*
Take **three *jīn* of Dan-Yang** and **four *liǎng* of spiritual sand**, moistening with vinegar and silver powder. Attach to the body and place in the vessel, using **four *liǎng* of fire** at the child, adult, and hour of the dragon and rooster. Nurture for seven days—one *jīn* of fire suffices per refinement. Cool, then reassemble into a vessel. If the precious form appears, it is cherished.

**Fifth Transformation: Transcending the Mundane, Entering Sagehood—Nurturing Mother Sand into Precious**
*Poem:*
*"Fire’s power aids the Great Axis,
The Dan-Yang Vessel grows ever more divine.
Transcending the mundane, entering sagehood in true essence,
Five days of baking yields a worldly treasure."*

*Method:*
From the **third transformation**, take the Dan-Yang vessel’s cinnabar, refining it into silver in a **yellow furnace**, forming **three-sevens mother sand** (five *qián* to nine *qián*). Boil in **alum-salt broth** for one *fúshí* period, then harden, moisten with honey, and attach to the body. Place inside the previous Dan-Yang vessel, using **four *liǎng* of fire** at the child, adult, and hour of the dragon and rooster. Nurture for five days—two *jīn* of fire suffices. After five refinements of fire nurturing the mother sand, proceed to the **sixth transformation**.

**Sixth Transformation: Nurturing the Seven Treasures into the Great Medicine Vessel**
*Poem:*
*"The cinnabar’s nature unites yin and yang,
Sulfur’s sacred function now merges.
The three-sevens mother sand encloses the former,
Pill formed—divine treasure within."*

*Method:*
Take the accumulated fire from the first five transformations, grinding the Dan-Yang vessel into powder (**two *liǎng***), adding **raw cinnabar** and **three yellows** (each one *liǎng*), and **mercury** (one *liǎng*), finely ground until no stars remain. Mix with **two *liǎng* of patchouli grass** in **yao-hua juice**, then layer the other herbs, slow-firing into a paste. Shape into nine **marble-sized pills**, drying them like iron. Use **holy silver** to form the three-sevens mother sand, attach to the body, and place in the previous five-times-fired vessel. Nurture for seven days with **two *jīn* of fire**. When opened, it resembles a **golden marble**—this is the **Great Medicine**.

Accumulate thirty *liǎng* to form a vessel for the later stages.

**Seventh Transformation: Cinnabar Beyond-Dust Refinement**
*Poem:*
*"The Seven Treasures’ source returns to the Great,
Cinnabar receives *qi* to forge the elixir.
One day, creation aligns with the True Sovereign,
Mercury and cinnabar become gold in an instant."*

*Method:*
Take the **thirty *liǎng* of Seven Treasures** to form a vessel. Add **three *liǎng* of raw sulfur** and **seven *liǎng* of raw cinnabar**, shaping with **mulberry juice** into nine marble-sized pills. Place in the treasure vessel, using the same fire regimen, nurturing for seven days without refinement. When cooled, the cinnabar-sulfur pills are **purple-gold**, dense with spirit, their luster dazzling.

**Eighth Transformation: Beyond-Dust Refinement**
*Poem:*
*"The Dao’s elixir transcends life and death,
Transforming mortal flesh for those with resolve.
Not only does mercury revive the dead—
Who knows that mortal bones may ascend to the heavens?"*

*Method:*
Reduce to powder. For every three *qián*, refine one *liǎng* of mercury into treasure. Take fresh iron filings, moistened with hundred-flower honey, and add ten *liǎng* of mercury. Mix in one *liǎng* of cinnabar powder, seal with a lid, and secure the seams with vinegar and red stone pitch. Apply a moderate fire of four *liǎng*, listening for internal rumbling—this is the *dry* phase. The cinnabar-mercury mixture remains unchanged; sweep it into the vessel to nurture. Refine again until the mercury is free of dust, then nurture for one year, yielding one grain per *liǎng*.

**Ninth Transformation: The Purple Cloud Great Elixir**
*Poem:*
*"Believe that all possess hidden realms—
Sincere cultivation reveals the truth.
The Purple Cloud Elixir nears Penglai’s shores,
When refined, its hue is green as fate’s decree."*

*Method:*
Take the accumulated thirty *liǎng* of Seven Treasures, ground into powder, to form the vessel. Add seven *liǎng* of transparent cinnabar, also powdered, shaping with mulberry juice into nine pills—do not handle with bare hands. Place in the vessel, seal tightly, and apply four *liǎng* of fire. Nurture for forty-nine days during the *zi-wu-xiao-you* hours. Cool in a cold furnace, burn incense, and pay homage to the Three Pure Ones. When opened, its radiance dazzles. Reduce to powder, shape with nine dates into the size of *wu tong* seeds, encase in crimson silk, and submerge in a well one *chi* below water. After seven days, the toxic fire is purged—this is the **Purple Cloud Great Elixir**. One grain refines one *liǎng* of mercury into ten *fen* of *gēng*.

Ingesting it, one sheds the mortal coil and ascends as an immortal, transcending to sainthood.

---
*End of Volume Two*
*Begin Volume Three of the Lead-Mercury Regimental Treasures*

**The *Zi-Wu Ling-Sha* Method of Nourishing Mercury**

**Ling-Sha**, when its mulberry ash is refined, must be washed three or four times with concentrated juice before cooking—do not let it contaminate the original. When pounding it, avoid excessive fragmentation.

**First Refining**
Ling-Sha, regardless of quantity, is ground into small dice-like blocks. With mulberry ash juice, it is cooked for two *fú* periods, then removed. For every *liǎng* cooked, take the Ling-Sha and mix with six *qiǎn* of silver powder and one *liǎng* two *qiǎn* of mercury, combining them in an iron mortar to form one *liǎng* half of **nourished Ling-Sha**.

**Thickened Layering Method**
Use one *jīn* of **alumen** (*fǎng*), four *liǎng* of **anemarrhena** (*zhī mǔ*), finely ground and stir-fried until smoke rises. Once the smoke from anemarrhena dissipates, remove it and place the Ling-Sha in a sealed vessel with salt. When the Ling-Sha has thickened like a lotus, add it to the vessel, cover with **alumen** (*shā fǎng*), seal tightly, and secure with **red stone pitch** (*chì shí zhī*), making it half an inch thick. Let it dry daily, then bury it in an ash jar.

On the **second and third nights**, apply four *liǎng* of fire.
On the **fourth and fifth nights**, apply five *liǎng* of fire.
On the **sixth and seventh nights**, apply six *liǎng* of fire.
By the **seventh night**, apply half a *jīn* of fire.

**Eighth Day**
Remove the excess fire.
Wait until the vessel is thoroughly cold, then scrape off the dirt and open it to retrieve the Ling-Sha—**do not discard the thickened layers (the nourished Ling-Sha)**.

Next, use **balanofruit** (*bō lèng zǐ*), **bitter cardamom** (*kǔ jiǎ zǐ*), **water caltrop** (*dā shuǐ huā*), **Chinese yarrow** (*tián zì cǎo*), and **golden lampwort root** (*jīn dēng cǎo gēn*), finely ground into five powders. With **purple hemp juice** (*zǐ gé zìrán zhī*), knead them into one ball, securing the Ling-Sha inside. Place in a crucible and refine with **seven to eight *jīn* of fire**, until the flames subside and the liquid forms. Remove the **nourished Ling-Sha** (*líng shāo*), discarding the original.

Next, refine in the **lead cauldron** (*qiān chí jiān*), using one *liǎng* of Ling-Sha to one *liǎng* of lead.

**Second Refining**
With the refined silver powder, knead the original Ling-Sha and cook it with fire as before.

**Third Refining**
Use eight *liǎng* of mercury, two *liǎng* of **realgar** (*shí tíng zhī*), and one *liǎng* of **orpiment** (*xióng huáng*), ground and mixed into a powder. Evenly pour into the mortar, stir-fry to a **green-gold head**, pound the Ling-Sha, and cook it as before. If it does not transform, only follow the **vessel-nourishing method** during the third refining: refine the Ling-Sha into powder, and for every four *liǎng* of powder, use one *liǎng* of mercury. Knead until no grains remain.

Generally, for a **twenty-*liǎng* vessel**, use five *liǎng* of mercury. Take ten *liǎng* of Ling-Sha powder and five *liǎng* of mercury, kneading them until no grains remain. Of the remaining ten *liǎng*, place five *liǎng* at the vessel’s base, then layer the kneaded mercury mixture (fifteen *liǎng*) in the center, and finally cover with the remaining five *liǎng* of mercury-free powder. Seal the vessel with **red stone pitch** (*chì shí zhī*) and mud, wrapping its entire body with **paper-fiber mud** (*zhǐ gēn ní*), then bury it in an ash pit for seven days until half a *jīn* of fire is sufficient.

In a **cold furnace**, gently use an iron spoon to scoop out the top five *liǎng* of mercury-free powder, then the central fifteen *liǎng* of mercury-infused powder, and finally the bottom five *liǎng* of mercury-free powder. Combine the top and bottom mercury-free portions (ten *liǎng*) into one.

Use seven *liǎng* of mercury to knead the remaining portion until no powder grains remain. Take half of the earlier kneaded mixture and place it at the vessel’s base, layer the newly kneaded mercury mixture (fifteen *liǎng*) in the center, and cover with the remaining half of the earlier mixture. Seal as before, bury in the ash jar, and increase the fire for nourishing. Follow the same method as earlier.

After seven days, remove it. Combine the upper and lower layers, then knead with eight *liǎng* of mercury. Seal and refine with fire as before, resulting in **forty *liǎng* of vessel-nourished Ling-Sha**. This is called the **Feeding and Refinement Method**.

This can nourish **Ling-Sha** and **mercury powder** (*fěn shuāng*). After winter, increased fire enhances its **virtue/power** (*dé*), without the **yellow soil head** (*huáng tǔ tóu*) flaw. If the vessel appears dry after several refinements, add four *liǎng* of powder to one *liǎng* of mercury, feeding it to restore **virtue/power** (*dé*) without depletion—each *liǎng* becomes more refined.

**Fourth Refining**
Use eight *liǎng* of mercury and one *liǎng* each of **male and female sulfur** (*zhuāng xióng*).

First, **intercourse** (*jiāo gōu*) the sulfur and mercury, then refine the male and female sulfur together into Ling-Sha. Cook and refine with fire as before—**do not use the original Ling-Sha**. Instead, within the third vessel, nourish for seven days, adjusting the fire as in the **Feeding and Refinement Method**. Only then form the vessel, and refine **Gēng-Sha** (*gēng*) over **seven sevens** (*qī qī*) days.

If it appears dry during nourishment, follow the **Feeding and Refinement Method** as before.

**Fifth Refining**
Use **three-yellow Ling-Sha** refined earlier, place it in the fourth vessel, and refine the Ling-Sha again with the **Feeding and Refinement Method**, then return it to the **alumen** vessel. **Do not use the original Ling-Sha**; instead, wrap it with herbal medicine in this vessel to refine **golden Ling-Sha** (*jīn shā*) more effectively. Use seven *qiǎn* to refine one *liǎng* of **red flesh** (*chì ròu*), gradually producing **soles-of-shoes skin** (*jiǎo xuē pí*)—the **true elixir** (*zhēn dān*) for **yang transformation** (*yáng huàn*) and **bone-changing** (*gǔ*).

**Sixth Refining**
Use **three-yellow Ling-Sha** without cooking—only within the fifth vessel’s refined Ling-Sha, nourish with fire for seven days. Remove and examine the quantity; take as much as desired. This **sixth refining** of Ling-Sha can use seven *qiǎn* to refine one *liǎng* of **red flesh** (*chì ròu*), achieving the **true elixir** (*zhēn dān*) for **yang transformation** (*yáng huàn*) and **bone-changing** (*gǔ*)—the **orthodox method for blackening the soles** (*zhèng jiǎo hēi* □).

This can be used in the **Dead Dragon Coiling** (*sǐ lóng pán*) method, also called **White Snow** (*bái xuě*) or **Bright Window Dust** (*míng chuāng chén*).

**Seventh Refining: Dead Dragon Coiling Method**
Using the **crucible method** (*dǐng fǎ*), for every one *liǎng* of the sixth-refined Ling-Sha, knead with one *liǎng* of mercury until no grains remain—**the standard ratio is thirty-three *liǎng*** (*fǎ zhèng sānshān sān liǎng*). Combine thirty *liǎng* of Ling-Sha with thirty *liǎng* of mercury, kneading into sixty *liǎng*, then place in the crucible. **Rise in the morning, descend in the evening**, pounding it into **White Snow** (*bái xuě*).

The crucible’s height is twelve *cùn* around its circumference, corresponding to the **twelve months**. Its length is eight *cùn*, corresponding to the **eight seasonal nodes** (*bā jié*).

**Refining the Crucible’s Dimensions and the Dead Dragon Coiling Method (Continued)**

The upper crucible’s width is twice that of the lower, thus aligning with the **twenty-four qi** (*èrshí sì qì*). The upper crucible represents **Heaven**, the lower **Earth**; rising denotes **Yang**, descending denotes **Yin**. When **Yin-qi** seeks to ascend and **Yang-qi** seeks to descend, this reflects the **refining of Yin and Yang** (*yīnyáng táo yě*). The crucible’s width and length must neither be too large nor too small—**too broad disperses the qi, too narrow forces it to overflow**, thus failing to achieve the **balanced harmony of ascent and descent** (*shùn hé shēng jiàng*).

The upper crucible’s circumference is **twenty-four cùn**, while the lower is **three-tiered**, matching the crucible’s rim. The lower crucible’s length is **eight cùn**, its circumference **twelve cùn**, with a **three-tiered rim** to fit the upper crucible’s descent. **No deviation is permitted.**

This crucible lacks a base. Instead, **forge an iron rim to thicken it**, securing three **iron pegs** (*sān zhú*) as feet—**each as thick as a thumb, two and a half cùn high**. Then fashion the **Yin and Yang furnaces** (*yīnyáng èr lú*).

The **Yin furnace** is dug into the earth as a pit, burying a jar whose mouth matches the upper crucible. **Cover it with thick earth**, leveling it with the jar’s opening. **Shape the remaining soil into four walls**, resembling a **walled enclosure without ground** (*wú dì xiàng*). The **Yang furnace** is merely stacked flat on the earth.

When the **sixty-liǎng** of refined medicine is placed inside the crucible, **adjust with cinnabar paste** (*chì shí zhī*) to form a thin, cohesive mud. **Pierce with iron wire through the ears**, securing it tightly. **Refine as with Ling-Sha**, using **four-season fire** (*sìshí huǒ*) for **seven days and nights** to complete the process. **The three elements—water, fire, and medicine—correspond to Heaven, Earth, and Man** (*tiān dì rén sān cái*).

**Four-season fire** proceeds thus:
- **Spring fire** (*chūn huǒ*) seeks warmth,
- **Summer fire** (*xià huǒ*) seeks intensity,
- **Autumn fire** (*qiū huǒ*) seeks moderation,
- **Winter fire** (*dōng huǒ*) seeks subtlety.

This method is practiced on a **Child Day, Child Hour** (*zǐ rì zǐ shí*), placing the crucible atop the **three-footed stand**. **Insert the Yang furnace**, then stack charcoal beneath the crucible until its body is **one-third submerged**, using **gentle, slow-burning fire** (*huǎn wén huǒ*) to make the **inner qi intermingle** (*nèi xiāng jiāo gòu*), lasting **one and a half hours**.

Next, **apply fierce fire**, piling charcoal to **half the crucible’s height**, lasting **one and a half hours**. Then **intensify the flame**, raising the crucible’s body to **three-fifths its height**, lasting another **one and a half hours**. Finally, **gradually reduce the fire**, using **subtle heat** until the **inner medicine’s qi settles** (*nèi wēn wēn qì dìng*), lasting **one and a half hours**. At **midday**, remove the crucible and place it in the **Yin furnace**, seating its belly atop a **small jar’s mouth**, then **bury three-fifths of its body in ash**. **Drain the upper crucible’s moisture with cloth**, ensuring it is dry before placing it on the **crucible tray**. **Light one catty of fire**—**Spring fire**—inside. Let the **mercury within descend slowly**, lasting **one and a half hours**. **Stack charcoal and fan the flames**, gradually increasing the intensity for **one and a half hours**. Then **let the fire blaze fiercely**, from the **upper crucible tray to the ash**, until **one and a half hours** have passed. Afterward, **extinguish the upper fire**, then **gradually remove the lower fire**, using **subtle heat** until the **inner medicine’s qi stabilizes** (*nèi yào qì dìng*), lasting **one and a half hours**. By **midnight**, return the crucible to the **Yang furnace**, repeating the **ascent and descent** (*shèng jiàng*)—**now fully refined, yet still incomplete**—until **seven days and nights of fire** are fulfilled.

**Break the crucible**, extracting a small portion of **White Snow** (*bái xuě*). Place it in the **Qi furnace** (*qì lú*) to **dissolve into liquid** (*huài chéng zhī*), **without loss or waste** (*bù zhé bù hào*), completing the task.

If any **White Snow** is **slightly damaged or discolored**, refine another crucible using the same **ascent-descent method** for **seven days and nights**, then extract the **White Snow mercury** as **Great Treasure** (*dà bǎo*). Should the **elixir’s Dao** (*dānshì Dào*) be **leaked or exposed**, take this **Dead Dragon Coiling** (*sǐ lóng pán*) as **stillness** (*jìng*). Grind it in an **iron mortar** (*tiě xiàng*) until powdered. **Form a thin iron vessel** (*bó hézi*), placing **three parts of White Snow** inside, then **inserting a long hole** (*chā zhòng cháng kǒng*). **Fill it with mercury** until full, repeating this **circumferentially** (*zhōu chā*), resembling **a lotus pod** (*ruì lián zhī zhuàng*). **Cover the opening with one part**, securing the seam. **Place the vessel atop an ash pool**, keeping the ash **one and a half cùn deep**. **Light four liǎng of fire** to begin, increasing to **ten liǎng**—**day and night**. On the **eighth day**, extinguish the remaining fire. When cool, open the vessel and **harvest the White Snow crystals** (*bái qióng tiáo*). **Each one-catty portion** can **refine one liǎng of Ling-Sha** (*chì ròu*) into **True Elixir of Heavenly Transformation** (*zhēn huàn gǔ dān yáng*). If using **three to two catty portions** for one liǎng, the result is even more refined. Otherwise, **merely refining it yields silver**, which is also acceptable.

**In total, this process involves seven extractions.** By the **eighth extraction**, the method shifts to **six days of refining**. After six days, proceed to **five days**. Then **four sets of four days**, **three sets of three days**, **two sets of two days**, until finally reaching the **morning extraction and evening collection of White Snow** (*zhāo zhǒng mù shōu bái xuě*). At this point, **one liǎng can refine mercury into its highest purity** (*sǎn huáng sì chū zhī miào*), rendering it **infallibly effective** (*wú bù líng*).

**Master Day-Hua’s Oral Precepts:**
**First Refining: Yellow Sprout into Great Treasure**
Pound the **Yellow Sprout** (*huáng yá*) until shattered, then **water-fly and wash** (*shuǐ fēi táo*). Whatever **passes through the water** belongs to the **crucible’s vessel**, nurtured as **Great Medicine** (*dà yào*). What **does not pass** is **White Sand** (*bái shā*), melted into **Treasure** (*bǎo*), unfit for medicine.

**Second Refining: Yellow Sprout Produces Dust**
Take **five liǎng of inner gold** (*nèi jīn*) and **Yellow Sprout**, place in the **Hua Pool** (*huá chí*), adding **five and a half liǎng of mercury**. Refine it over fire until it **forms sand**. Extract and place it in the crucible, sealing it tightly. **Refine with two cycles of Wu and Wen fires** (*liǎng wén wǔ huǒ*), nurturing it **one day and one night**. Reextract and **pour five liǎng of mercury** over it, following the **previous fire cycles**. The result, when extracted, is **Great Treasure**.

**Third Refining: Cultivating Yellow Sprout into Jade Fields**
Take **half a catty of Yellow Sprout**, **half a catty of mercury**, and **half a catty of silver powder** (*yín mò*), mixing them uniformly into mud. **Combine the three essences** into the **Hua Pool**, quenching **fifty times** (*qìng wǔ shì*). Extract and place in the **furnace crucible**, securing it tightly. **Refine with fire**, following the **previous cycles**, until it **melts into Treasure**.

**Master Qing-Xia’s Saying:**
**One liǎng of Yellow Sprout** can **refine one liǎng of Ling-Sha** (*chì zhàng zǐ*) into **Great Treasure**. Alternatively, take **five catties of Sprout as the mother**, quenching it **once every five days**, extracting **five liǎng** each time.

**Fourth Refining: Cultivating the Essence of Ming-Chuang Dust into the Original Source of Vermilion and Mercury**
Take **two liǎng of Ming-Chuang dust** (*míng chuāng chén*), placing it in the **Divine Chamber**. Use **high-quality cinnabar lumps** (*zhu shān kē kuài*) of **one liǎng**, enclosing them within the **fusion vessel**. Spread the **Ming-Chuang dust** above and below, then pour **one liǎng of mercury** over it, securing it tightly. Place it in the **ash pool** for refining, nurturing it for **forty-nine days**.

When opened, all becomes **violet gold powder** (*zǐ jīn fěn*). Smelt it into **Treasure**, and its hue will match **true gold**—this is the **unchangeable violet powder elixir**.

If ingested, grind it finely into powder, form **dates-flesh pills** (*zǎo ròu wán*) the size of **mung beans** (*méng dòu*), and swallow **one grain** with an empty stomach using **well-bloom water** (*jǐng huā shuǐ*). It will **settle the spirit and stabilize the soul** (*àn hún dìng pò*), dispel illness, and prolong life. There are also **posthumous prescriptions** (*cù jīng*) that remain unspoiled for **seven days**—use **half a qián of cinnabar**, mix with cold water, and pour into the mouth of the deceased. They will revive in **mere moments**.

Its **Ming-Chuang dust** may be formed into **pills with ramie juice** (*chǔ zhī wán*), the size of **sesame seeds** (*má dòu*), with **one to two grains** swallowed to prolong life, exhibiting **extraordinary spiritual efficacy**.

**Fifth Refining: Cultivating Ming-Chuang Dust with the Two Qi Method**
Take **two liǎng of Ming-Chuang dust**, placing it in the **crucible**. Use **one liǎng of raw sulfur** (*shuāi huáng*) and **one liǎng of mercury**, grinding both finely together, then layering them within the crucible above and below the **Ming-Chuang dust**, securing it tightly. Place it in the **furnace** and refine with fire for **five days**.

When opened, all will appear **violet gold** in color. Grind it finely again, then add **five qián of raw sulfur** each time, grinding uniformly. Form **pills with ramie juice** the size of **mung beans**, and **one pill** can **coat one catty of mercury** to produce **Treasure**.

**Sixth Refining: Cultivating Ming-Chuang Dust into the River Chariot**
Take **five liǎng of Ming-Chuang dust**, placing it in the **Divine Chamber**—this is the **Great Divine Chamber**. Use **five liǎng of mercury**, layering it like **lotus seeds** within the **dust**, securing it tightly. Place it in the **furnace** and refine with fire following the **previous cycles** for **seven days**.

When opened, all will sprout, ascending like **sprouts** upon the crucible, forming **violet River Chariot powder** (*zǐ hé chē fěn*). Smelt the **sprouts** into **true Treasure**.

**Seventh Refining: Transforming the River Chariot into Violet Gold Elixir**
Take **five liǎng of violet River Chariot powder**, grind it into fine powder, mix with **vinegar** (*zǐ cù*) to form a paste, and knead it into a **fusion vessel**. Once dry, place **mercury** inside, then enclose it in the **Divine Chamber**, securing it tightly. Refine with fire for **seven days**.

When opened, all will become **vermilion, cinnabar, and mercury** (*dān shā gǒng*). Smelt it into **true Treasure**.

**Eighth Refining: Cultivating the River Chariot into Yellow Sprout**
Take **one liǎng of violet River Chariot** and **one liǎng of realgar** (*chén shā*), grinding both finely into powder. Place it in the **Divine Chamber**, secure it tightly, and refine in the **ash pool** for **forty-nine days**.

When extracted, grind it finely again. Form **pills with ramie juice** the size of **hemp seeds** (*hú má zǐ*), with an empty core, and swallow **one grain** with **unsooted wine** (*wú huī jiǔ*). This **elixir** can **restore the soul and revive the dead** (*fǎn hún qǐ sǐ*). Ingesting it for **ten days** will cause the **Three Corpses** (*sān shī*) to depart.

**Master Qing-Xū’s Saying:**
If a person dies and their body remains unspoiled for **seven days**, use **half a qián of this elixir**, mix with cold water, and pour into their mouth. They will revive and return to life at any time.

**Ninth Refining: Subduing Realgar with Male Sulfur to Transform Its Nature**
Take **one liǎng of Yellow Sprout**, **one liǎng of realgar**, **one liǎng of mercury**, and **five qián of male sulfur** (*xióng huáng*), grinding them all finely together. Place it in the **Divine Chamber** and refine with fire for **seven days**—this is sufficient.

When extracted, grind it finely again. Form **dates-flesh pills** the size of **mung beans**, and swallow **one grain daily** with an empty stomach using **well-bloom water**. If taken when **yang vitality is declining** (*yáng shuāi*) or **life force is exhausted** (*qì jué*), with **spirit wandering and confused** (*jīng shén huǎng hu*), ingesting it will **stabilize and restore yang vitality** (*gù yáng shēng lì*), **doubling strength and vigor** (*gāng jiàng bèi jiā*), **reverting aging to youth** (*fǎn lǎo huán tóng*), and **reviving the dying** (*huí shēng qǐ sǐ*).

If taken by **inner attendants** (*nèi chén*), it will **renew their youthful complexion** (*zài tóng yán*), with effects **unmatched in efficacy**.

**Mercury’s Transformation: The Tenth Method**
Place **one catty of mercury** in the **leaping vessel** (*tiào nài*), and **two grains of elixir** can **coat it** to produce **Treasure**.

**Eleventh Refining: The Male Sulfur Method of Transformation**
Take the **previously prepared Yellow Sprout pills**, placing them in the **Divine Chamber**. Use **one liǎng of Yellow Sprout powder** to layer above and below, securing it tightly. Refine with fire following the **previous cycles** for **one hundred days**—this is sufficient. When opened, **one grain of elixir** can **coat one catty of iron** to transform it into **true gold**.

**Dao/Way’s Verification is Beyond Debate**—by now, **spiritual transformations** (*líng biàn huà*) are complete.

**Twelfth Refining: Coating Mercury with Violet River Chariot to Produce Treasure**
Combine the **Yellow Sprout** and the **River Chariot sprouts** uniformly, then add **four liǎng of realgar**. Layer and secure them in the **Divine Chamber**, refining with fire following the **previous cycles** for **thirty-five days**—this is sufficient. When extracted, grind the **cinnabar** into powder and form **pills with ramie juice** the size of **mung beans**. Each **grain** can **coat ten liǎng of mercury** to produce **Great Treasure**.

**Thirteenth Refining: Cultivating the Violet River Chariot into Yellow Sprout**
Take **one liǎng of powdered frost** (*fěn shuāng*), layering and securing it in the **furnace**, refining for **twenty-one days** (*sān qī rì*). When extracted, each **grain** can **coat ten liǎng of mercury** to produce **Treasure**. This substance has **other transformations**.

**Fourteenth Refining: The Violet Gold Elixir’s Method of Subduing the Five Metals**
Take **one liǎng of River Chariot powder**, placing it in the **Divine Chamber** and securing it tightly as before. Refine with fire for **one year**, adjusting the **fire’s intensity** (*huǒ lì*) like the **Great Elixir**.

Form **pills with ramie juice** the size of **mung beans**, and **one grain** can **coat the five metals** to produce **Great Treasure**.

**Fifteenth Refining: The Dao/Way’s Method of Violet Gold Transformation**
Take the **previously prepared violet River Chariot powder**, place it in the **Divine Chamber**, and secure it tightly. Refine with fire for **one year**, then extract. Form **dates-flesh pills** the size of **hemp seeds**, placing them in the **Divine Chamber** and securing it tightly for **forty-nine days** before extraction.

Wrap the substance and immerse it in **flowing water** for **forty-nine days**, then extract. Observe **ritual purity** (*zhāi jiè*), bathe, and swallow **one grain** with an empty stomach using **unsooted wine**. It exhibits **other spiritual efficacies**.

**Sixteenth Refining: Transforming into Violet Gold Elixir**
Take **four liǎng (or half a catty)** of this **golden River Chariot** (*jīn hé chē*), placing it in the **Golden Divine Chamber**. Use **one liǎng of sprouts**, layering the **violet River Chariot** above and below to secure and seal it. Refine with fire for **one year**, then extract, dividing it into **five elixirs**.

If **Great Treasure** encounters **golden elixir** (*jīn dān*), refine with fire following the **previous cycles** for **one year**. Upon opening the **furnace**, observe **ritual purity**, bathe, and **offer thanks to Heaven and Earth** (*zhòu xiè tiān dì*). Only then open the **crucible** to collect the **various elixirs**.

If **congealed formations** (*níng jié*) are seen on the **crucible**, resembling **true vermilion**, it is called the **Dragon-Tiger Great Reversion Elixir** (*Lóng Hǔ Dà Huán Dān*). Ingesting it for **one hundred days** will **cleanse and elevate one to immortality** (*chōng shēng cháng shēng bù sǐ*), allowing **cloud-soaring in the Violet Palace** (*yún yóu zǐ fǔ*). Even **chickens and dogs** that consume it will **transform into dragons and phoenixes**.

Within the **fusion vessel**, there are **golden flowers** on all four sides, resembling **fish scales** (*yú lín piàn*), called the **Divine Symbol White Snow Elixir** (*Shén Fú Bái Xuě Dān*).

If the four sides are of a pale red hue, it is called the **Purple Extremity Elixir** (*Zǐ Jí Dān*). Since purple does not change with other colors, it is also called the **Purple-Gold Elixir** (*Zǐ Jīn Dān*). If the crucible’s edges are entirely adorned with golden flowers, radiant and dazzling, it is called the **Golden Elixir of the Minor Reversion** (*Jīn Yè Xiǎo Huán Dān*).

As for the above elixirs, roll them into pills with mulberry bark juice the size of hemp seeds, let them dry, wrap them, and soak them in flowing eastern water for one hundred days. Take a drop of well-water, place one grain inside, and take four *liang* of the elixir as one dose. This elixir must be refined with utmost care and precision—its divine efficacy is self-evident. After a thousand days of ingestion, one’s bones, body, and five viscera will all turn golden. All the elixirs of gold, stone, herbs, and wood in the world are impure, but this elixir is non-toxic. Neither water nor fire can harm it; all malevolent forces keep their distance, and it grants the status of an **Earthly Immortal**.

**Sixteen Transformations**
**Yellow Sprout Encounters Treasure (First)**
Crush the yellow sprout and wash it in water. The floating portion is cultivated as medicine; the sand within the water dissolves into treasure, called **White Gold**. **Yellow Sprout Extracts and Produces Medicine (Second)**
Take five *liang* of the sand from the water, add it to the mercury pool, and let it solidify into a mound. Place it in an iron vessel and seal it tightly. Nurture it for three days, then gradually increase the fire from two *liang* to five *liang* daily, until it reaches one *jin*. Place it in the **Divine Chamber** and refine it through nine cycles. When ingested with the five metals, it grants immortality—known as the **Red Stone Elixir** (*Chì Shí Dān*).

**Red Stone Elixir Seeds the Jade Field (Third)**
This is called the **Immortal Jade Root** or the **Great Gushing Spring**. Take one *liang* of red cinnabar, refine ten *liang* of mercury, grind it into powder with vinegar, and mix it with ten *liang* of quicksilver, stirring into a paste. Then place it in the mercury pool and temper it ten times. Again, add ten *liang* of mercury into an iron vessel, cover it with sand and stone, and seal it tightly. Nurture it in an ash pool with five *liang* of fire for seven days until full. Add another three *liang* of mercury, nurture for seven more days until it produces white laughter—take three *liang* of this and add it to three more *liang*. When ingested, it becomes a **Cauldron Treasure**, inexhaustible, a technique of the **Golden Shell**.

**Transformed into the Four Divine Elixirs (Fourth: Taking Clear Window Dust)**
Take one *liang* of the **Four Divine Elixir**, half a *liang* of sulfur from the ship, and three *liang* of mercury, grinding them into powder. Place them in a bottle from Hunan, set within an ash pool, and nurture for twenty-one days, increasing from half a *liang* to ten *liang*, then cease. After twenty-one days, remove and grind it two thousand times. After a year of refinement, it gradually transforms into light dust—water cannot drown it, fire cannot burn it. At noon, scatter a small amount into the empty sky, and it will turn into white clouds, ascending to heaven with unfathomable depth.

**Refining Mercury with Clear Window Dust (Fifth)**
Take five *liang* of **Clear Window Dust**, mix it with rice vinegar into a paste, dry it, and place it in a mercury vessel, sealing it tightly. Refine it with both gentle and fierce fires for one *fu* period, and it becomes treasure—usable as an instrument and capable of distinguishing all poisons.

**Clear Window Dust Preserves Its Original Color (Sixth: Method of Refining Cinnabar)**
Take **Clear Window Dust**, layer cinnabar above and below, and refine it with both gentle and fierce fires for one *fu* period. Form it into pills with date-flesh juice. Ingesting them calms the soul and steadies the spirit. If a person dies and has been deceased for seven days, use half a *qian* of refined cinnabar with cold water, and place it in their mouth—they will revive, their soul returned. If **Clear Window Dust** and refined cinnabar are nurtured for a year, their transformations match those of the Great Elixir, though they cannot ascend.

**Clear Window Dust Transforms Copper into Silver (Seventh)**
Take arsenic and grind it into powder. Purify it in a clear garden, then layer **Clear Window Dust** above and below, and refine it for one *fu* period. For every *liang* of powder, add one *jin* of the rod to make treasure.

**Refining Yellow Lead (Eighth, also called Purple River Carriage)**
Take ten *liang* (or one *jin*) of yellow lead and refine it like a great medicine for ten months, until it becomes purple-gold powder.

**Purple River Carriage Adds Mercury (Ninth)**
Take one *liang* of **Purple River Carriage** and one *jin* of mercury, place them in the mercury pool, and temper them three times. The mercury will naturally form white frost. Seal it in a vessel and nurture for seven days—it will become yellow gold. Remove it, add more mercury, and follow this method repeatedly. This is the **Human Seed Gold**, a technique of the **Shell Art**.

**Purple River Carriage and Realgar Wood (Tenth)**
When the **Purple River Carriage** powder forms a block, take an unrestricted amount of realgar, place the powder in a vessel, and layer it above and below, sealing it tightly. Nurture it in an ash pool for seven days to produce **Refined Realgar**. For every *liang* of powder, add one *qian* of bornite resin, roll it into pills with mulberry bark juice the size of broad beans, and take three with empty stomachs, using unslaked wine.

**Refined Realgar and Dry Mercury (Eleventh)**
Take ten *liang* of mercury and half a *liang* of refined realgar powder. Sprinkle the mercury inside, cover it with damp paper in a tea cup, and seal it tightly. Refine it with both gentle and fierce fires for one *fu* period, gradually heating until the crucible glows red—it will then become treasure.

**Purple River Carriage Refines the Purple Elixir (Twelfth)**
Take four *liang* of **Purple River Carriage**, eight *liang* of mercury, and four *liang* of realgar, place them in an iron vessel, and seal it tightly. Nurture it in an ash pool for forty-nine days—equivalent to a year of refinement—until it turns the color of polished yellow gold. Roll it into pills with mulberry bark juice the size of hemp seeds. Each grain can refine one *jin* of mercury into the ultimate treasure.

**Purple-Gold Reversion Elixir Transforms Dry Mercury into Gold (Thirteenth)**
Take one *jin* of mercury and one pill of the elixir, place them together in a crucible, and refine them slowly in an ash pool with gentle fire for one *fu* period. If it turns yellow, it becomes treasure from the furnace.

**Purple-Gold Reversion Elixir Transforms Iron into Gold (Fourteenth)**
Take one *jin* of raw iron and temper it into **Water Purple-Gold**. Place one grain of the elixir in a pot and apply it—it will become superior gold.

**Purple-Gold Reversion Elixir Transforms Copper into Gold (Fifteenth)**
Take one *jin* of copper and temper it into water. Place one grain of the elixir in a pot and apply it—it will become superior gold.

**Ingesting the Purple-Gold Reversion Elixir (Sixteenth)**
Take three pills with an empty stomach daily, using clear wine. After ingesting a thousand pills, all venomous snakes, fierce beasts, malevolent spirits, and evil deities will be powerless to harm you. It surpasses all worldly elixirs of gold, stone, herbs, and wood. After a thousand days of ingestion, one’s five viscera, bones, and marrow will all turn golden, granting immortality and eternal life as a **Land-Bound Immortal**, ascending to the Violet Palace.

**Elixir of Longevity and Life Preservation by the Emperor of Taiwei**
**First of the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions in Cold Forest**

**Method for Refining True Lead:**
Take mountain or marsh silver, place it in a sweet crucible, and refine it into a liquid, forming millet-grain beads.

**Method for Nurturing Cinnabar:**
Take one *liang* and eight *fen* of transparent cinnabar, suspend it in a gestation vessel, and boil for one *fu* period.
For the decoction: use borax, green vitriol, and white vitriol, each two *qian*; and rock salt, half a *liang*.
Combine these into a powder, boil in sour wine, and use for bathing.

**Bathing Preparation:**
Take *qianghua* (Cynanchum), *yuanzhi* (Polygala), and *chuanjiang* (Sichuan pepper), each three *qian*, boil in water for half a day, then strain. Dry over fire and grind into a thick paste with pine soot in a bowl, rolling until black.

**Application of Protective Coating:**
Use refined honey to coat the body, then apply powdered *tiezhi* (ironstone) to the surface. Before sealing, mix wild *zhimu* (Anemarrhena) root, *qianghua*, *yuanzhi*, and salt into a paste, apply it inside, then layer the lead powder like a lotus, covering it thoroughly. Use lotus leaves to isolate and seal with salt powder, then fix in an ash pit and nurture with fire.

Nurture with three *liang* of fire for three days, three *liang* and eight *fen* for three days, and four *liang* for one day. Remove and test on fire—if it does not liquefy, nurture again until it submits.

Then take out and add one *liang* and eight *fen* of cinnabar into the vessel for nurturing, following the previous fire regimen. After seven days, remove, yielding three *liang* of cinnabar.

Use this three *liang* of cinnabar as the vessel, then take two *liang* and eight *fen* of raw cinnabar, refine it as before, and add three *liang* of lead through three cycles of gestation fire. Nurture it in the cinnabar vessel without using wild *zhimu* root to seal—only cinnabar powder to cover and seal tightly.

Place in the ash pit and nurture with fire: two *liang* for two days, three *liang* for three days. Remove three *jin*, destroy with intense fire, and let cool. Its color will be red-and-white; grind finely and add back to the vessel for the third cycle.

**Third Cycle: Enhancing Cinnabar into Precious Substance**
Take the previous five *liang* of cinnabar, grind finely as the vessel. Add three *liang* of cinnabar, following the previous method for coating and fire regimen. After the second cycle’s fire process, its color remains white without change.

For the third cycle, follow the previous steps, yielding eight *liang* as the vessel. Add medicinal nurturing for *tongling* (awakening spirit), completing the nine-cycle method.

**Fourth Cycle: Eliminating Fetal Qi Without Addition**
Take the previous eight *liang* of cinnabar, grind and place in a vessel. Cover with mica stone slices, fill with talc powder, and seal tightly. Nurture in an ash jar with three *liang* of fire for three days, then remove and discard the talc.

**Fifth Cycle: Reverting to Earthly Form, Turning Yellow, and Generating Life**
Take the fourth-cycle cinnabar, place it in a vessel, and again cover with mica. Add two *liang* of refined *xionghuang* (realgar), grind finely, and cover. Follow the previous fire regimen of three *liang* for three days—its color reverses to yellow, like earth.

Set aside the *xionghuang* for other uses.

**Sixth Cycle: The Method of Uncovering Celestial Foundation Without a Cover**
Within the five cycles, when the earthly form appears, secure it with herbal medicine. The sixth and ninth cycles revert to their original substance.
Use yang fire to refine it into ash. Place the previous cinnabar in a vessel without covering with mica—only mix with wheat-stalk ash to seal. Nurture with three *liang* of fire for three days.

**Seventh Cycle: The Seven Reversions**
When cinnabar reaches the seventh cycle, its color reverts to red, becoming the primordial cinnabar again—hence, *huandan* (reversion elixir). At this stage, its spirit transforms.

Initially, its color is emerald-green, resembling the mother substance. Without lead, the five yellows and three whites undergo transformation, requiring synchronization with the medicine.

Upon reaching the seven reversions and nine returns, use the original lead to externally secure it—this is the Dao of returning to the origin.

All things revert to their primordial essence, achieving longevity and transformation. From this point, the elemental essence is restored, allowing dead mercury to undergo seven cycles.

**Seventh Cycle Continued:**
Take the previous cinnabar, grind and place in a vessel, covering it. Use the first-cycle lead to cover, nurturing with three *liang* of fire for three days. Remove—its color reverts to red, capable of transforming into yellow-and-white six *liang*.

The mother substance no longer requires seven reversions; once the eighth cycle is established, it can generate life. Use this seven-reverted cinnabar as the vessel, nurturing three *liang* and seven *fen* of mother cinnabar, divided into four blocks and sealed. Nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days, and four *liang* for one day. Repeat this nurturing three times, then use two *fen* of mother cinnabar, following the previous fire regimen, nurturing for nine cycles.

After nurturing the mother cinnabar three times, destroy it to form a treasure. Take two *fen* of the seven-reverted cinnabar powder as the base, place it in a mercury vessel, and carve four indentations inside. Add half a *liang* of mercury to each, then cover with one *fen* of the powder. Nurture with two *liang* of fire for three days, then remove.

Repeat, creating indentations for two *liang* of mercury, following the previous method. After thirty such cycles, pour two *liang* of mercury and nurture with two *liang* of fire for one night—only then does it attain spirit. This marks the mystery of the eighth cycle.

**Eighth Cycle: Separating from the Mother, Entering Transformation**
Use four *liang* of raw cinnabar, wrap it in gold foil, and place it in the elixir vessel. Nurture with fire—this cycle is detailed within the first variation.

**Ninth Cycle: Also Named Nine-Return Elixir**
Remove the nurtured cinnabar and place it in another vessel for further nurturing—this is elaborated in the sixteen variations.

**Alchemical Refining in the Dan Chamber: Master Zhao Zhongming’s Six Verified Methods**

**Dead Washing (死盥):**
For each batch of ten *liang*, use one large bowl of *yangchi* root-leaf juice to wash and filter the material, then dry it. Mix in two *liang* of soapberry powder, spread evenly in a sand pot, and heat with intense fire until the pot glows deep red—stop when the smoke ceases.

**Dead Alum (死明矾):**
Burn with five-directional grass ash juice for half a day, then dry and heat until the pot glows red.

*Alternatively, use* **páng’ěr** *(*苍耳*) juice.*

**Dead Niter (死硝):**
First, rinse the pot multiple times with ginger juice. Then, boil the niter with ginger juice for three hours. Once the juice evaporates, cover and heat until slightly reddened, then remove—this is true dead niter.
*Used within powdered frost.*

If niter is to be destroyed for other uses, boil it with *xiāngzhī* and soapberry in a decoction for half a day, then heat until red—this is true dead niter, rendered inert.

**Dead Sulfur (死硫):**
First, burn *huángsù* (yellow millet husks) into ash, steep and boil for a day. By evening, spread the ash on the ground and let it cool overnight. The next morning, pound fresh *bōcài* (spinach) into two or three basins of natural juice. Heat an iron *tiàojué* (jumping furnace) until red, melt the sulfur, and pour it into the cold spinach juice—repeat three or four times until no smoke remains. If smoke persists, remelt and pour into fresh juice until none remains.

*When adding sulfur to the furnace, first mix the previously steeped husk ash with thick ash juice into a paste, then cover the fire. If sulfur emits thick smoke, quickly cover the fire with ash—this is the supreme method.*

**Dead Male (死雄):**
Extract juice from *cāngmù* (blue wood) and *dāngguī* (angelica), mix with male powder in a jar, and boil for a day. Once dry, cover the jar with the boiled residue, heat in a bright furnace until slightly red, then remove immediately. Once cooled, smash the jar—the male powder will congeal into a single mass at the bottom.

**Dead Female (死朋):**
Blow *chuānniúxī* (Chinese knotweed) into a powder, mix with raw *mǔlì* (oyster shell) to remove fine particles, then decoct the knotweed to make a broth. Boil the female oyster shell in this broth for a day, place in a sand pot, cover with the knotweed residue, and heat intensely until red. Once cooled, the oyster shell and female powder will naturally separate.

*The six methods are fully verified.*

**Sealing the Crucible’s Mouth:**
Mix *zhēnshā* (borax), *géfěn* (oyster powder), and vinegar into a paste.
*Alternative methods:*
- Mix *báishàn tǔ* (white clay), *géfěn*, and vinegar.
- Mix ash and vinegar.
- For the *liùyī ní* (six-to-one clay), first heat it, then apply.

**Mirror Source of the Dan Chamber:**
*Yúnmù fěn* (cloud-mirror powder) refines mercury and subdues cinnabar—also edible.

**Keymire Flower (芹花):**
Rises like *sháoyáo* (peony) blossoms, red-green in hue, growing three *chǐ* tall, with yellow spots on its leaves. Bitter and pungent, it can be boiled with female orpiment to stabilize fire.

*Leigong* says:
*"Female orpiment obtains keymire—immediately becoming *gēng* (elixir)."*

**Patchwork Stone (补天石), also *Xiūtiān shí* (修天石):**
Subdues lead and resists fire.

**Purple-Backed Celestial Thistle (*Zǐbèi tiānkuí*):**
Purple on the back, green on the front—it solidifies lead’s form and reverses dead lead.

**Zōngxīn Grass (宗心草), now called *shízhúhuā* (石竹花):**
Retains arsenic within the crucible.

**Qīngxū Grass (青须草), now called *hǔxū cǎo* (虎须草):**
Boiled with sulfur, it stabilizes fire and immediately forms *gēng*. If sulfur encounters *chìxū yù* (赤须玉, Red-Bearded Jade), its powder can nurture cinnabar.

**Mángxiāo (芒硝, Mirabilite)** subdues female orpiment.
**Shízhōngrǔ (石锺乳, Calamine)** can be used as an outer inert substance to nurture cinnabar, refine sulfur, and make powdered sulfur.
**Zǐfān shí (紫矾石, Purple Alum)** refines mercury.
**Huáshí (滑石, Talc)** refines male and female orpiment as an outer inert substance.

**Stone Gall (石胆):**
From *Yúxiāng County*, *Púzhou*—egg-sized, green when struck, splitting into layered patterns. If exposed to wind for long, it turns green inside as well.

**Lead Mountain’s Bitter Spring (信州铅山县):**
Its flowing water, when boiled, forms *dǎnfān* (胆矾, Copper Sulfate), which can be smelted into copper. Even iron pots, boiled long enough, will also transform into copper.

**Copper Acetate (*Zēngqīng*):**
Only that from *Wùzhōu* (蔚州) is true—avoid *jiāshí* (夹石, intermingled stone) and *tóngqīng* (copper green).

*For alchemical work requiring one *liǎng*, use:*
- *Zǐbèi tiānkuí* (紫背天葵)
- *Gān cǎo* (甘草, Licorice)
- *Qīngzhī cǎo* (青芝草, *Unclear, possibly* Green Herb)

Dry or moist, equal parts in a basin, mixed with other herbs. Boil slowly for five days and nights without losing control of water and fire. Once complete, rinse in flowing water, then grind in a mortar until powdered. Use this to refine copper acetate into mercury, generating *jīnqì* (金气, Metallic Qi).

*Additionally:*
If copper acetate stabilizes into a paste, it can immediately refine mercury into silver.

**Eight Stones Transformation:**
*Kōngqīng* (空青, Azurite) follows the same method—*Wùzhōu* (蔚州) is superior.

**Realgar (雄黄):**
After a thousand years, it transforms into gold. If it resembles *zhègū gān* (bluebird liver) in color, use:
- *Gāncǎo* (甘草, Licorice)
- *Tiānkuí* (天葵, Celestial Thistle)
- *Dìdǎn* (地胆, Earth Gall)
- *Bìlénghuā* (碧棱花, *Unclear, possibly* Blue Ridge Flower)

Each finely ground, five *liǎng* per herb.

**Realgar (雄黄):**
Three *liǎng* of realgar, rinsed in flowing water, placed in a crucible, and boiled for three *fú* periods. Once cooled, it is pounded into powder, then water-floated to remove impurities—dried and ground again for use.

If it contains *jié tiě shí* (劫铁石, "plundered iron stone"), it must not be mixed with saltpeter to form a solution, as this weakens its fire-retention.

**Stone Sulfur (石硫黄):**
Can refine mercury when dry.

*Scripture says:*
"This sulfur blackens upon contact with the five metals but turns red when exposed to mercury."

*Additionally:*
If the sulfur is bright yellow like a sprouting seed, it is suitable for use.

**Refinement Process:**
Four *liǎng* of sulfur, one *pǔ* of *lóngwěi hāo* (龙尾蒿, Dragon-Tail Artemisia) juice, three *pǔ* of flowing water, and one *pǔ* of *zǐbèi tiānkuí* (紫背天葵, Purple-Backed Celestial Thistle) are combined. *Xùsuì zǐ* (续遂子, *Cynanchum* stem) juice is added, mixed evenly, and placed in a sweet crucible. Using *liùyī gùjì* (六一固济, "Six-to-One Solidification"), the sulfur is crushed and added. The medicinal decoction is gradually poured in while boiling until the liquid is exhausted.

Next, take one *liǎng* of powder (100x the original), two *jīn* of *liǔbàng* (柳蚌, Willow Shell) powder, and two *jīn* of *yīcù cǎo* (一簇草, *Possibly* *Achyranthes bidentata*) finely ground. Boiled in flowing water with the previous herbs for two *fú* periods, the decoction is strained, and the residue is boiled again with licorice (*gāncǎo*), then ground repeatedly in a mortar. *Yèzǐ qīhuáng* (叶子雌黄, Leafed Orpiment) can transform sulfur, and *fǔ fěngshuāng* (伏粉霜, "Subdued Powder Frost") must be recorded—do not delay its use.

**Orpiment (雌黄):**
Four *liǎng* of orpiment, with *tiānbì zhī* (天碧枝, Celestial Blue Branch), *héyáng cǎo* (和阳草, Harmonizing Yang Herb), and *xùsuì cǎo* (续遂草, *Cynanchum* Herb), each five *liǎng*, dry or moistened in double measure. Boiled in a jar-crucible for three *fú* periods, its color turns golden like a liquid.

One *tàn* (探, "dip") is taken from below, then violently rinsed in flowing water three times. Dried and pounded through a sieve into fine dust for use.

*Greatly forbidden:* Contact with filth.

If black orpiment is refined with fire-retention, its embryonic color remains unchanged, forming a liquid to adorn treasures.

**Gypsum (石膏):**
From *Guìzhōu* (桂州), it can refine mercury into cinnabar when placed in a crucible.

First, decoct *tiānkuí* (天葵) and *yèjiāoténg* (夜交藤, Night-Jasmine Vine) juices together for one *fú* period to neutralize their toxicity. Ten *liǎng* of the herbs are combined and boiled to completion. The resulting powder, when sifted, produces a silken smoke.

**Magnetite (磁石):**
Four *liǎng* of high-quality magnetite refines cinnabar and nurtures mercury, removing copper’s luster.

For stubborn hard or soft mercury, one *jīn* of magnetite is ground with one *pǔ* of *wǔhuā pí* (五花皮, Five-Petal Bark), one *pǔ* of *dìyú* (地榆, Chinese Thorowax), and fifteen *liǎng* of raw silk. The mixture is crushed into small pieces, placed in a ceramic vessel, and boiled in flowing water for three days and nights. After drying and wrapping in cloth, it is pounded on stone, then ground into fine dust. *Níngshuǐ shí* (凝水石, "Congealed Water Stone") can be used to create an oily coating, which is edible.

To refine cinnabar into a *kuì* (匮, "container"), *fǔ xuánjīng cháng qǐshí* (伏玄晶肠起石, "Subdued Dark Crystal Intestine-Rising Stone") can serve as an external *kuì*.

Non-charred wood can boil mercury. *Yóuzhōu* (游州) wood is superior.

**Dragon Liver (龙肝):**
Or aged ten years, dug from one *chǐ* below the furnace, in straight purple-black pieces, can refine cinnabar, shrink *hè shí* (贺石, "Felicitous Stone"), subdue sulfur, remove tin’s luster, refine realgar, and process *páo shā* (炮砂, "Cannon Sand"). It can also serve as a *kuì*, named *Bái Hǔ Kuì* (白虎匮, "White Tiger Container").

**Red-Leaf Alum (红皮矾石):**
Can refine cinnabar, nurture mercury and arsenic, and dry mercury while transforming copper.

Grass-refined with fire-retention preserves its embryonic color when forming the liquid.

Those attuned to *qi* can directly refine *kū chāi* (枯拆, "Dried Fragment") without using *dàizhě shí* (代赭石, Hematite), producing golden *páo shā* (炮砂). It can also refine orpiment and realgar, with grass-refined fire-retention preventing fracture.

It can refine all stones into black lead, and with grass-refinement, produce treasure. Copper can be turned into silver, and cast into tripods to nurture cinnabar and retain fire, or to refine mercury and retain fire, or to subdue powdered arsenic.

**Alchemical Elixir Methods:**
For all elixir-making, take one *jīn* of lead, two *liǎng* of sulfur, and one *liǎng* of saltpeter. First, melt into a liquid, then add vinegar dropwise while boiling. When rolling and boiling, add a small piece of sulfur, followed by a little saltpeter. After boiling stabilizes, add vinegar again, then more saltpeter in small amounts until the boiling ceases and the yellow (sulfur) is exhausted. The residue is fried into powder, forming *huáng dān húpǔ* (黄丹胡粉, "Yellow Lead Barbarian Powder"), which can refine sulfur or serve as an external *kuì*—this is the modern *huápǔ* (化铅所作胡粉, "lead-transforming barbarian powder").

**Wu Chang Copper (武昌铜):**
When forged into elixir, it does not crack.

**Steel Salt (戎盐):**
Purely refined into red and black forms. Layered eggshells dry mercury to produce cinnabar. *Lǔwǎn* (卤盥, "Salt Brine") is purely refined into four yellows for soldering. *Xié xuàn fán* (握雪矾, "Snow-Clutching Alum") dries mercury to produce mercury itself. Cinnabar and alum are stored in ceramic bottles, heated until internally and externally glowing red. The lid is lifted with tongs, and a *shífēng wō* (石蜂窠, "Stone Bee’s Nest") is placed inside, burned until exhausted. The bottle is then cooled, struck open, and the contents ground into powder.

A pit is dug beneath a house, five or six *cùn* deep. The powder is wrapped in paper and left overnight, then re-ground. For every ten *liǎng* of work, six *liǎng* of *shífēng wō* are used.

**Alternative Method:**
Grind into powder and place in a ceramic bottle holding three *shēng*. Seal with *liùyī* mud and bake by the fire until dry. After grinding alum finely, add *wǔjiǎo cǎo* (五角草, *Possibly* *Achyranthes*) and *tiānkuí* juices, each one *pǔ*, gradually adding alum while boiling until the liquid evaporates. Cover with a cup and seal with mud, heating from *sǐ* (9–11 AM) to *wǔ* (11 AM–1 PM). Once cooled, grind into light powder.

For use, saltpeter is ground into powder, placed in a bottle, and heated in a five-*jīn* fire until uniformly red. *Jīcháng yè* (鸡肠叶, Chicken Gut Leaf) and *xiàng zǐrén* (相子仁, *Possibly* *Brucea javanica* seeds) are mixed, formed into small pearls, and placed in the red bottle with four *liǎng* of saltpeter. The chicken gut and seed juices are used to coat the pearls until exhausted. Saltpeter refined with grass retains its fire without breaking.

All mineral sands are first washed in fragrant water, dried, crushed, and ground in a white mortar for three *fú* periods.

Take a jar or pot, place the sand inside, and layer *gāncǎo*, *tiānkuí*, and *wǔfāng cǎo* (五方草, *Possibly* *Schisandra*) on top and bottom. Rinse with flowing water until clean and dry, then grind into powder. Store in a small ceramic bottle.

The following is your translation:

---

**Green Zhi Grass** (青芝草) and **Mountain Xu Grass** (山须草), each half *liǎng*, are layered on top. It is heated in a ten-*jīn* fire from the *sì* hour until the *zǐ* hour, then set aside.

When cold, it is again ground into powder for use.

For five *liǎng* of sand, use two *liǎng* of **licorice root** (甘草), one *bō* of **celosia** (天葵), and one *bō* of **Schisandra** (五方草) juice. Collect **mica** (云母) with a lustrous sheen like water, one *jīn*. Use one *bō* each of **small earthbinder grass** (小地胆草, *Possibly* *Hedyotis diffusa*), **purple-backed celosia** (紫背天葵), **fresh licorice root** (生甘草), and **Rehmannia root** (地黄) juice. The dry ingredients are finely ground, while the moist ones yield their juices. In a ceramic jar or pot, place the **stone** (石) and all the medicines together, and add three *bō* of **Heavenly Pool Water** (天池水). Simmer for seven days and nights—**do not let the water or fire deviate** (失度). The stone will naturally turn jade-green, and the **jade essence** (玉浆) will settle below.

Then, pour **Heavenly Pool Water** (天池水) forcefully into it, stirring. Remove any floating impurities like **snail slime** (蜗涎). Repeat this process three times.

Next, take three *shāng* of **aloeswood decoction** (沉香汤), dividing it into three doses. Further rinse the **essence water** (浆水) clean, dry it, and store it for later use. **Cinnabar** (朱砂) refined with grass retains its fire without breaking, and its **embryonic hue** (胎色) is fully developed in the juice—this may be used to mark treasures.

**Mercury** (水银) meets **sulfur** (硫) and solidifies; meets **lead** (铅) and congeals.

**Dead Mercury** (死水银), use **purple river car** (紫河车, *Possibly* *Cistanche* or *Placenta hominis*).

To **kill mercury** (水银要死), use the natural juices of **purple-backed celosia** (紫背天葵) and **night-blooming jasmine vine** (夜合交藤, *Possibly* *Jasminum sambac*). Combine these two and simmer for one *fú* period, then add **lotus rhizome nodes** (藕节). Simmer with **asafetida** (阿魏) to kill the **copper womb** (铜紫河车). The **white copper mercury** (白铜汞) will not disperse.

**Ligusticum wallichii** (益母草) can refine **sulfur** (硫黄); **turmeric ash** (郁金灰) can solidify **sand** (砂子). **Mallow juice** (楮汁) can submerge **mastic powder** (没药砂子); **benzoin resin** (乳香) can soften **copper** (哑铜, *Possibly* *muted/malleable copper*). **Mulberry ash** (桑灰) can solidify **mercury** (结汞); **dragonskin** (拖子, *Possibly* *Dragon’s blood resin*) can soften **gold** (柔金). **Galla** (五倍子) can assist **lead** (佐铅); **willow bark glue** (杨柳胶) can solidify **sand** (结砂子). **Horse fat** (马脂) can soften **the five metals** (五金). **Dung** (粪) nurtures all medicinal powers; **cow dung** (牛屎) can extract **copper haze** (抽铜晕). **Sheep tallow** (羊脂) can soften **silver** and **malleable copper** (柔银软铜). **Dried ram’s horn** (段羊角) can shrink **realgar** (缩贺). **White dog dung** (白狗粪) can be used to boil **tin** (煮锡). **Mantis egg-case fat** (蜻皮脂, *Possibly* *Ootheca mantidis*) can refine **realgar** (伏雄黄) and soften **copper** (软铜). **Cuttlefish bone** (乌贼鱼骨) can be used for **light washing** (淡盥). **Sesame oil** (胡麻油) is superior in strength. **Yellow cinnabar** (黄丹) can be used with **sand** (砂粟). **Grass ash** (草灰) can extract **tin haze** (抽锡晕). **Praying mantis ash** (祷麦灰) can be boiled into **powdered frost** (煮粉霜). **Bitter gourd** (苦瓠) can be used to boil **mercury** (煮汞). **Husk fire** (糠火) must be relied upon for its strength. **Dongcai ash** (董菜灰) can refine **cinnabar** (朱砂) and **sulfur** (硫黄). **Horsetail ash** (马齿灰) can be boiled with **cinnabar** (丹砂) to solidify **mercury** (结汞). **Five-colored amaranth** (五色苋) can be used to boil **sand** (煮砂子). **Winter melon vine ash** (冬瓜蔓灰) can be used to boil **mercury** and **cinnabar**, as well as to break **copper and tin** (碎铜锡).

**White Snow Holy Stone Scripture** (白雪圣石经):
**White Chalkstone** (白垩石) – three *shāng*
**White Stone** (白石) – twenty *liǎng*

Take three *shāng* of water and mix it within the cauldron. Use charcoal fire to decoct until the water reduces; when the water is nearly gone and the surface ripples vanish, the **Stone Flower** (石花) will immediately emerge.

Next, use a willow-wood spoon to press the flower onto paper. Once dry, place it in a jar, seal tightly with mud, and fire it for one day and night until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the jar to retrieve it—now formed as a cluster of **White Snow**, named the **First Refinement of Holy Stone**.

Take this stone and grind it finely. Add four *liǎng* of the earlier **White Stone**, decoct together to extract the flower, then dry it and place it tightly in a bottle. Pour a *dàhé* of white honey over the medicine, then surround the bottle with three to four *jīn* of fire. After the honey dries, gradually increase the heat until the bottle turns red for the duration of a meal. Retire the fire, let it cool, then break the bottle to remove it.

Again, take two *liǎng* of the earlier **White Stone**, decoct together to extract the flower, dry it, and place it in a jar, sealing it tightly. Fire it for the duration of one *fúshí* until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the jar to retrieve it—the stone now turns green, named the **Second Refinement of Steely Salt**, which can soften eggshells.

This method subdues **femininized orpiment** (伏雌黄) and **talc** (滑石), known as the **Jade Method**.

Take half a *jīn* of talc powder and five *liǎng* of this stone, grind them together, and mix with rice vinegar. Place in a bottle and boil in a heavy simmer for three *fúshí*—it will become **Supreme White Frost Jade**.

Another method: Use half a *jīn* of this medicine and half a *jīn* of **masculinized orpiment** (雄黄), following the decoction method, and it will become **Red Glass**.

Again, take this stone and add two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, dry it, and mix with **rice paste, vinegar, and black donkey milk** (乌驴乳) totaling half a *jīn*. Stir thoroughly, place in a bottle, and boil in a heavy simmer until the milk dries. This is named the **Third Refinement of Glass**, which absorbs sand and can subdue mercury.

**Method of Use:** Grind one *jīn* of mercury with three *liǎng* of this stone for half a day. Place in a pot, surround with three to four *jīn* of fire, and gradually reduce the heat until the mercury surges and boils steadily—this is the **One-Essence Subdued Fire True Treasure**.

Take this stone and grind it finely, add three *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, mix with honey to form cakes, and place in a bottle sealed with raw silk. Place the bottle in a cauldron and boil in a heavy simmer for one *fúshí*. After cooling, break the bottle to retrieve it—now named the **Fourth Refinement of Green Sandstone**.

Take this stone, grind it finely, place in a bottle, and mix evenly with rice vinegar. Boil in a heavy simmer for five days and nights—this is the **Fifth Refinement of Black Convenient Spirit Stone**, which is deep in hue. It can temper lead, mercury, and tin into gold when fired.

**Ingestion Method:** Mix five *liǎng* of **Black Spirit Stone** with one *jīn* of mercury, stir evenly, and after half a day, seal with mud and bury in fresh dung. Use husk fire and horse dung to fire it for three days and nights until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, retrieve it—now a round **Subdued Fire Treasure**, radiant with five colors like red glass. Though it lacks the power to ascend to heaven, ingesting it grants eternal life.

Take four *liǎng* of this stone, grind it finely, add two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, and place in a vessel to fire for one day and night until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the bottle to retrieve it—now named the **Sixth Refinement of Purple-Clothed Sandstone**, which can subdue mercury.

**Method of Use:** Grind one *jīn* of mercury with one *dàliǎng* of this stone for half a day. Place in a pot and fire until the mercury surges and boils steadily—it will become one *jīn* of **Soft Gold**, malleable under torch flame, suitable for hammering into blades or sheaths.

Take four *liǎng* of this stone, grind it finely, add two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, and place in a vessel to fire for one *fúshí* until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the bottle to retrieve it—now named the **Seventh Refinement of Dao Glass**.

**Method of Use:** Take one *liǎng* of this stone and one *jīn* of mercury, mix evenly, and fire until the mercury boils steadily—it will become one *jīn* of **Purple-Ground Gold**, five times more potent than ordinary gold by weight.

Another method: Take four *liǎng* of this stone, grind it finely, add two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, and place in a vessel to fire for one *fúshí* until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the bottle to retrieve it—now named the **Eighth Refinement of Hidden Dragon Verdant Wave Stone**, which can subdue black tin into gold.

**Method of Use:** Strike ten *jīn* of black tin into thin sheets. Place four *liǎng* of **Verdant Wave Stone** in a cauldron, then add rice vinegar and decoct, continuously adding vinegar. After one day and night, it will become ten *jīn* of **Yellow Gold**, surpassing all other metals.

Take two *liǎng* of this stone and two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, dry it, and place in a vessel to fire for one *fúshí* until it turns the color of flame. After cooling, break the bottle to retrieve it—now named the **Ninth Refinement of Red Stone**, which can subdue mercury.

**Method of Use:** Grind one *jīn* of mercury with four *liǎng* of this stone, place in a pot, and surround with fire. When the mercury surges and boils steadily, it will become ten *jīn* of **Red Gold**.

Take four *liǎng* of this stone and two *liǎng* of **White Stone**, decoct to extract the flower, and place in a vessel to fire for one *fúshí* until it turns the color of flame. Melt it in a pot to form a **Dragonfly-Red** hue—now named the **Tenth Refinement of Green Emperor’s River Vehicle**, also called **Yellow Stone**. It can subdue all hard substances, turning them into jade, and transmute copper, iron, lead, tin, and mercury into **Red Gold**.

Take one *jīn* of **Stone Flower** and one *liǎng* of **Yellow Stone** powder, mix them, and it will immediately become gold.

If ingested, each of these stones also grants eternal life.

For crafting vessels from these jade-like stones, grind one *jīn* of the stone into powder for each object, mix with one *liǎng* of **Yellow Stone**, and grind evenly. Place in a bamboo tube without bark, boil in a heavy simmer until it liquefies. To shape an object, mix talc powder with animal glue and apply it to a mold. Pour the liquid into the mold—once set, the object will be transparent, luminous, and exquisite.

The crafting of **Dao/Hua Crystal** follows similarly.

Take **Yellow Stone** four *liǎng*, **White Stone** two *liǎng*, and extract the essence as before. Once dry, place it in a bottle and heat until it glows like fire for one *fúshí* (watch period). Melt it in a pot, then cool and break the bottle to retrieve it—this is called the **Eleventh Transformation: Radiant Light Sand-Yellowing Stone**, also known as **Smoke Stone Treasure**.

**Method:** Grind **Black Tin** ten *jīn* into powder, mix with **Sand-Ze Stone** four *liǎng*, and boil with rice vinegar for one *fúshí*. Then, using husk fire and cow/horse dung, heat until it glows like fire for a day and night, yielding **Ten *jīn* of Purple-Gold Fern**.

When ground into powder and ingested, it grants **eternal life without death**.

Take **Sand-Ze Stone** four *liǎng* and **White Stone** two *liǎng*, extract the essence as before, dry it, and heat in a vessel until it glows like fire for one *fúshí*. Once cooled, melt it in a pot—this is called the **Twelfth Transformation: Serene Serene Jade-Light Stone**.

**Method:** Use refined **lead** ten *jīn*, hammered into cakes. Mix with **Serene Serene Stone** five *liǎng* and boil with vinegar for one *fúshí*—this yields **Ten *jīn* of Purple-Glazed Gold**.

If **mature copper** ten *jīn* is melted into liquid and stirred with one *liǎng* of this gold, it becomes **ten *jīn* of Yellow Gold**.

Take this stone four *liǎng* and **White Stone** two *liǎng*, with five *jīn* of water, and extract the essence as before. Heat in a vessel until it glows like fire for one *fúshí*, then cool and melt into ingots—this is called the **Thirteenth Transformation: Red Stone**.

**Method:** Use refined **lead** ten *jīn*, flattened into thin sheets. Grind **Red Stone** four *liǎng* into powder, mix with rice vinegar into a thin paste, and coat the lead sheets. Let dry, then apply a half-inch layer of cow dung. Once dry, arrange in a flat-bottomed pot and heat with husk and horse dung fire until it glows like fire for three days and nights—this transforms the lead into **ten *jīn* of Mature Gold**.

One *liǎng* of this gold equals five *liǎng* of ordinary gold.

Take this stone four *liǎng* and **White Stone** two *liǎng*, with five *shǎng* of water, and extract the essence as before. Heat in a vessel until it glows like fire for one *fúshí*, then cool and melt into ingots—this is called the **Fourteenth Transformation: Sun-Moon Radiant Splendor**, also known as **Five-Colored Stone**.

**Method:** Take **clamshells**, remove the thick skin, and grind into fine powder. For each *jīn* of powder, mix with one *liǎng* of **Five-Colored Stone** and grind evenly. Place in a bottle within a cauldron and boil with heavy steam for half a day until it forms a paste. Roll into beads with both hands, pierce with a needle, and place in lime—after some time, they harden into **pearls**.

Feed them to a goose; after two nights, retrieve from its dung, wash, and polish until they shine brilliantly.

To create **night-illuminating pearls**, mix **clamshell powder** with **Crystal powder** in equal parts and follow the same method.

Take this stone four *liǎng* and **White Stone** two *liǎng**.

Zhang Xiu’s **Secret Key** reaches mastery at five transformations, while **Divine Channels** require twenty-one.

**Method:** Use three *liǎng* of the aforementioned stone, mix with one *jīn* of **mercury**, and grind for half a day. Heat with three *jīn* of fire until it glows like fire for one *fúshí*. Once cooled, it becomes gold.

Grind into powder, mix with two *liǎng* of **saltpeter**, and place in a barkless bamboo tube. Boil with heavy steam for three days and nights—it will liquefy and harden upon exposure to air.

Take one **mung bean-sized** dose on an empty stomach daily for three days to attain **eternal life**. After one hundred days, one gains the **power to ascend to heaven**, meeting deities who will bestow the title of **True Person**.

This stone is the **essence of the Sun**, while mercury is the **essence of the Moon**. Following this method, silver becomes gold—nothing entering fire fails to transmute.

The **five flavors** are the stone’s essence, while **mercury and gold** are its core. Lead is the stone’s essence, mercury the **qi** of gold. Twenty-one transformations lead to **supreme divine enlightenment**.

Fortunate to receive transmission from the **Supreme True Daoist**, lest the **Sacred Way** be lost and one suffer endless kalpas. Since the **Original Lord** transmitted this alchemical method through the ages, it must not be concealed.

The **Eight Stones** are named: **Dao/Hua Water, Crystal Pool, Sacred Ignorance, Imperial Flavors, Hu-Yao, Scattered Clouds, Abyss Root**—these are the eight stones by different names.

The unenlightened misinterpret the **Eight Books of Methods**. An ancient verse says:

*"Called the Purple Wandering Elixir.
The **Dragon-Tiger Scripture** states:
If one obtains the Purple Wandering Elixir,
Death is not difficult to avoid.
The **Sui-Luo** emerges from here—
This medicine births ten thousand things.
Also called **Purple River Vehicle**,
Filling my home with gold.
Red Breast returns to the Black Mother,
One substance blending the Three Sovereigns."*

The first transformation requires **two *dòu* of refined substance** and **two *shǎng* of *zē***. If the *zē* is of supreme quality—measured in *jīn*—then the refined substance’s quantity is indeterminate. The *zē* is hidden within the refined substance, melted and repeatedly clarified until pure—hence the **Parametric Accord** says:
*"Vague and indistinct, yet within it lies essence.
The square confines the ten crosses—this is the Mysterious.
The Mysterious is the number of water.
Thus the **Dragon-Tiger Scripture** says:
Water nurtures all things—only humans know this.
This is the mechanism of the **Dragon-Tiger Elixir**."*

Pass this only to the **enlightened**. The **Bao Jun Song** says:
*"White Snow Method—
A maiden companion for Liu Lang.
At twenty-eight, the medicine brings death,
Yet fire refining restores the Yang—
Sunlight turns it frosty white.
The Mother is **cinnabar**."*

**"The Method of the Fifteenth Transformation Preserving-Life Elixir"**

Simmer together to extract the flower, place in a vessel, and ignite until the fire’s glow lasts one *fú* time. Within the crucible, it melts into an ingot—named the **Fifteenth Transformation Preserving-Life Elixir**, also called **Glass Stone**.

**Method:** Use *yīng-xióng* (male-female) ore, *kōngqīng* (blue-green vitriol), *shílù* (stone sulfur), *shuǐyín* (mercury), and *zhūliúshā* (cinnabar)—these seven stones, all capable of becoming treasure. Take each of the aforementioned stones, one *jīn* per kind, grind separately into powder, and mix with one *liǎng* of Glass Stone. Once refined, it hardens upon exposure to wind, its surface luminous and unscathed by fire—this is the finest jade. When ingested, it secures longevity and extends life.

If one pound of mercury is mixed with this stone and ground for half a day, then heated in the crucible until boiling, it swiftly transforms into one pound of red gold.

When these stones are powdered—each one pound—and combined with one *liǎng* of Glass Stone, mixed with one *shēng* of rice vinegar, and placed in a bamboo tube without skin, then boiled in a double boiler for one *fú* time, the resulting jade resembles lost *miàn* stone, malleable into any vessel.

When ground with abalone shell until smooth and white, then buried in lime for a long time, it hardens into jade—translucent and radiant beyond compare.

As for *chēlì* (agate), *mǎnǎo* (agate), and the seven *sèsè* treasures, all may be thus formed.

The unenlightened fail to grasp this principle, mistaking it for disparate arts and methods.

When this stone undergoes five transformations, it becomes the **White Tiger**. At ten transformations, it is the **Green Emperor’s River Vehicle**; at twenty-one, the **Dark Heaven Purple River Vehicle**, equal in efficacy to the **Great Return Elixir**. By forty-nine transformations, it transmutes mercury into gold.

If this stone is refined two or three hundred times, how much more so at twenty-one? All transformations stem from this single method.

---
**Method for Refining Lead**
Divide the two stones equally, then refine them in lime, cow dung, wood ash, cold water, animal fat, and vinegar dregs—each for ten cycles. After flattening into thin sheets, they may be used to forge gold.

This method follows the **Celestial Prescriptions** above. When refined to twenty-one transformations, and the divine essence is further purified with *róngyán* (martial salt), it softens and becomes pliable—suitable for generating lead and mercury. After three days and nights of burning, gold is achieved.

If one seeks haste, take five *liǎng* of refined stone as powder, one *liǎng* of raw mercury, and two *liǎng* of black lead, grinding them together—this is called **Stone Powder**. Cover the ingot, seal with clay, and burn for three days and nights. Once cooled, remove the dross, yielding one *liǎng* of molten essence. Immerse it three times in fresh cow dung juice, and it becomes **Gēng**.

If one obtains a five-refined stone the size of a bean, mix it with one *liǎng* of mercury, hold it in the mouth for some time, then spit into the fire to burn—it will no longer disperse, and gold is formed.

---
**Test of the Golden Sage**

Half a *jīn* of gold is pounded on fresh, dust-free tiles.
In a five-star crucible, the essence is simmered—two *pàoqián* of mercury reveal its divinity.
Four *liǎng* of levelled lead are spread with one *fēn* of alum.
A *huā* of well-water is boiled for one *fú* time—when ripe, purple mist mirrors crimson clouds.
Half a *liǎng* of alum, one *fēn* of sulfur—these two are most refined.
Two trays hold the light, ethereal powder; the cinnabar’s vigor is unyielding.
Eight *liǎng* of silver flakes are layered—each silver stratum wraps a layer of cinnabar.
Vinegar-mixed *bái shàn* seals the mouth; seven days of steaming are praiseworthy.

One, two—fire’s stars ignite.
Four, one—two cycles until crimson.
Six, seven—four mornings add half a *liǎng*.
Six stars of lead, wrapped, possess singular merit.

Now take this cinnabar and silver as the vessel—
Foster the cinnabar anew—
This is **True Lead, True Mercury**,
The foundation of the **First Weaving**.

*(Excerpt from the Fourth Volume of *Jiaqiú Zìbǎo Jiàn*)*

**Secret Essence of the Great Primordial Elixir**

**Refining Cinnabar to Obtain True Lead and Master the Secret of Nourishing Primordial Qi**

---
**True Lead from the Mountain**
To refine cinnabar and obtain **True Lead**, one must select the most supple and tender variety—its **Primordial Qi** must be abundant. After passing through the fire to form its essence, add **snow-white arsenic** (砒), which should be light and delicate. Avoid the yellow, hardened, or crimson forms—these are **True Lead’s Qi** being too dense and thus useless.

All such varieties are heavy in **Lead Qi** and unfit for use. For every ten *liǎng* of **True Lead**, take two *liǎng* of small, block-like **arsenic**, cover it with **wax coins** (瓦钱), and let it smolder gently in the crucible. A slight smoke is permissible, but the fire must be kept low on all sides. Once the **arsenic** has fully transmuted into its essence, pour it into a **cinnabar vessel**, let it cool, and then carefully extract it. If the **arsenic** is a pale yellow—no issue—this is the finest quality. However, avoid deep yellow or red hues; though they may appear attractive, they indicate excessive **arsenic** loss, the foremost flaw.

If the **arsenic** loss is minimal and its color remains a fresh yellow, then the **Lead body** within is scarce and the **Primordial Qi** is plentiful—such **arsenic** is most potent. Therefore, the **Daoist scriptures** say:
*"This is the transmission of **Qi**—its substance is not used, but its **Qi** is."*

Thus, its wondrous efficacy becomes manifest, the most profound of mysteries. How could one not delve deeply into its essence?

The text states that though this method is said to be practiced by all under heaven, why then does it fail afterward? The secret lies in this: it is because one has not obtained **true Lead** and **authentic Qi**.

**The Three-Families’ Method of Killing Cinnabar with Dead Arsenic**
Take **gold crucible arsenic** (10 *liang* of fine powder) and **cinnabar** (10 *liang*), mix them well, and place them in a **water-fire crucible**. Seal the mouth tightly with clay, bind it securely with iron wire, and apply **water-fire**—**fire beneath, water above**—with utmost caution. Let the water boil to the point of **crab-eye bubbles** as the standard; do not add more fire, nor let the flame extinguish. Keep the water level at **eight-tenths full**, replenishing only with boiling water. If the water does not boil, the medicine below is too thick. **Never add fire**; maintain the original heat level and stir continuously for **six double-hours**. Then reduce the fire, wait overnight, and open the crucible to scrape out the medicine inside. Grind it into fine powder and return it to the crucible for a second refining. Repeat this process until the **fifth time**, at which point the crucible will **truly die**.

Take the **cinnabar** and **gold crucible arsenic**, now both dead, totaling 20 *liang*, grind them finely, and place them in a **sweet crucible**. Refine them into a liquid, set the crucible aside to cool, and open it—**the separation of the embryo has begun**.

**Method for Extracting Cinnabar from the Embryo**
If the cinnabar yields **10 *liang* of pure substance**, grind it finely into a **nurturing vessel**, add **4 *liang* of life-nurturing cinnabar**, and refine it according to the usual method for **seven days of fire**. When the fire is complete, remove it and it may then be used to **alchemize objects into treasures**.

**Method for Extracting Arsenic to Purify Lead and Attain Spirituality**
If **arsenic** is separated from the cinnabar—**10 *liang* of pure arsenic**—shape it into small blocks. Use **10 *liang* of refined silver**, refine it into a liquid, and gradually add each arsenic block until the liquid is fully consumed. Refine with **great fire** into a liquid, set the crucible aside to cool, and open it—the **silver’s Qi** will appear, indicating the **Lead** is within the silver.

Recover the **arsenic** and use **refined silver** separately. Each time, use **10 *liang* of silver** to process the arsenic through the liquid **four or five times**. After the embryo breaks the crucible and is removed, the silver will remain **snow-white, untainted**. At this point, the **Lead’s Qi** is exhausted, and the **arsenic is spiritually perfected**. It may then be made into a **nurturing vessel**, used to **alchemize dull substances**, nurture **cinnabar elixirs**, cultivate **powder sprouts**, or forge **□ medicines**—its efficacy is unparalleled.

**First Transformation: Nurturing Cinnabar Blocks**
Take **5 *liang* of cinnabar blocks**, moisten them with rice vinegar, and roll them in the **arsenic powder extracted from the embryo**. Place them in a **true-death arsenic vessel**, seal it, and apply **three *liang* of fire** for **seven days of nurturing**. Add **half a *jin* of fire**, and when the ash is fully consumed, cool it. The **five *liang* of cinnabar** will remain **immobile mercury**; it may then be used as a **long-life vessel**.

Only the **cultivated cinnabar** that emerges will be **vital red**, each grain the color of iron, having **subdued the true-death fire**. It may be further refined into a liquid, poured into a **mold**, and naturally **separate and alchemize**.

**Second Transformation: Alchemizing Iron to Separate the Embryo**
Take **1 *liang* of raw iron**, place it in a **sweet crucible**, and refine it into a clear liquid with **great fire**. Then add **seven-tenths of the cultivated cinnabar** (in granular form) to the iron liquid, stirring with **red charcoal** for **one double-hour**. Remove the crucible, set it on ash to cool, and open it—the **iron** will have transformed into **1 *liang* of fine silver**. Beneath it lies **honeycomb-patterned silver**, and **seven *money* of cinnabar** remains unchanged, floating on the surface, its **spirit undiminished**, its **weight unaltered**—this is the **separation of the embryo**, the **manifestation of the treasure medicine**.

The process of **separating the embryo** follows as before. For **gold, copper, tin, iron, and Lead**, all will become **fine silver**.

If the **cinnabar elixir** has been used once and its alchemical power has weakened, it must be returned to the **nurturing vessel** for **seven days of cultivation** before it can be used again. Alternatively, if one does not wish to recultivate it, the used cinnabar may be ground into powder, mixed with honey into a pill, and processed as follows.

**Third Transformation: Method for Red Lychee Silver**
Take **three-seven cinnabar** (3 *liang* of cinnabar, 7 *liang* of mercury), place **one grain of vital cinnabar** (the size of a **soapberry**) inside, wrap it in **cinnabar silk**, then in **two layers of soap silk**, and bind it tightly with thread. Suspend the embryo in a **porcelain jar**, add water and a small amount of **white alum powder**, and boil for **half a double-hour**. Remove it, then mix the **previously used embryo cinnabar powder** with honey into a pill, wrap it, and boil to extract the **mother cinnabar**, forming a thick **spherical mass**. Let it dry, place it on level ground, and shape **two bowls of vinegar-moistened ash** into a **hat-like form** around it.

First, ignite **four *liang* of firewood** to stabilize the flame, then gradually increase it to **three *jin*** (seven *liang* per *jin*). When cooled, remove the ash—**first three *liang*, then another three *liang*, and finally one *liang***—until the fire has consumed **three-tenths**, leaving the center **bright red**, where **cinnabar** will have formed. All of this is **the supreme treasure**, known as **Red Lychee Silver**. The **wrapped cinnabar** remains **unchanged**.

Additionally, **eight *liang* (or ten *liang*)** of the cinnabar may be reserved, mixed with **four *liang* of raw mercury**, ground together, placed in a **sealed vessel**, dried, and nurtured with **four *liang* of fire** for **seven days**. Add **one *liang* more of fire**, cool it, and recover the **mercury and cinnabar**, which will have **subdued the fire** and may be returned to the **nurturing vessel**—this is the **method for nurturing the mother cinnabar**.

**Fourth Transformation: Method for Nurturing the Three-Seven Mother Cinnabar Vessel**
Take **twenty *liang* of cinnabar powder**, spread **twelve *liang*** at the bottom of the vessel. Next, place **five *liang* of three-seven mother cinnabar** (boiled in **white alum water**), arrange it inside, and cover it with **eight *liang*** of powder. Seal the vessel as before, apply **four *liang* of fire** for **seven days of nurturing**, then increase to **three *jin* of fire**. When cooled, open it—the **mother cinnabar** will have **subdued the fire**, and the vessel’s efficacy will grow **more potent with time**.

However, if it is **removed after only seven days**, the **raw cinnabar** will have become **refined**, and after **twenty cycles of nurturing**, the **mother cinnabar** will have **absorbed the mercury**, and the **alum will be exhausted**.

**Fifth Transformation: Method for Transforming and Nurturing Mercury**
Take **twelve *liang* of the previous mother cinnabar**, press it firmly into the vessel, forming a **hollow center**. Pour in **mercury**, equal in measure to the cinnabar—**the more balanced, the better**. Seal the vessel tightly, let it dry, apply **four *liang* of fire** for **seven days of nurturing**, then increase to **three *jin* of fire**. When cooled, open it—the **mercury will have become a treasure**.

But once every seven days, extract the refined and return it to the raw, and the longer it is nurtured, the more potent it becomes. By the twentieth cycle, it can be ground and refined.

**Sixth Transformation: Method for Grinding and Refining**
Take the previous alum and grind it into powder. For every *liang* of mercury, place it in a crucible, then cover it with one *qian* of alum powder. Next, use a *qi* cup to seal it, sealing the seams with vinegar-moistened paper strips. Place the crucible over *three jin* of fire until the sound within ceases, and the bottom turns red for a long time. Then transfer it to cold ashes. Once cooled, open it—the mercury will have absorbed the fire, and the alum will remain unchanged.

Alternatively, pour mercury and grind-refine it twenty times. Its color will gradually turn yellow, and it can then be used in *Gēng* alum.

**Seventh Transformation: Method for Nurturing *Gēng* Mother Cinnabar**
Take twenty *liang* of the previous alum powder, along with two *liang* each of male and female orpiment, half a *liang* each of gall, yellow willow bark, and three alum types, and two *fen* of *jiē lǜ* (green vitriol). Grind these six ingredients together finely, place them in a fine silk pouch, and suspend it inside a silver-lined porcelain jar.

Separately, take one *fen* each of the previous six ingredients, along with one *fen* each of potash alum and green salt. Grind them finely, add vinegar, and boil the pouch in this mixture for half a day.

Then remove the cinnabar from the pouch and place it in the vessel. Seal it tightly, let it dry, and place it on level ground. Apply *three to four jin* of fire at the top. Once the fire is exhausted, cool and remove it, then grind it finely, blowing away the light ash. This yields the *Gēng* mother cinnabar.

**Eighth Transformation: Method for Initially Nurturing Heavy-Headed *Gēng* Mother Cinnabar**
Take ten parts of the previous alum, spread seven parts in the vessel, then form two *liang* and five *qian* of *liù Gēng sì hóng* (six *Gēng* to four cinnabar) into pellets. Wrap them in two layers of silk, suspend them, and boil them in the previous alum-vinegar mixture for two hours. Remove and place them inside the alum vessel, covering the top with the remaining three parts of the alum. Seal the vessel’s mouth and edges tightly, dry it thoroughly, and apply four *liang* of fire for seven days of nurturing. Then increase to *three jin* of mature fire. Once cooled, remove the mother cinnabar—it will now be a superior *Gēng* alum. The alum will forever serve as the *Chángshēng Gēng* (long-life *Gēng*).

But once every seven days, extract the refined and return it to the raw. By the twentieth cycle, reduce the mother and add mercury.

**Ninth Transformation: Method for Storing Mother and Adding Mercury**
Take mercury in a ratio of six parts to four parts *Gēng*, forming pellets as before, boiling them in the medicinal broth, placing them in the alum, and following the previous fire regimen. After several cycles, the alum will have absorbed the *Gēng* essence, and it can then be used to nurture *Gēng* cinnabar and cinnabar.

**Tenth Transformation: Method for Nurturing Light-Headed *Gēng* Cinnabar**
Take *Gēng* in a ratio of three parts to seven parts mercury, forming pellets as before, boiling and nurturing them, and following the previous methods. After several cycles of storing mother and adding mercury, reach a ratio of nine parts mercury to one part mother. Then, through repeated nurturing, follow the previous methods.

**Eleventh Transformation: Method for Transforming and Nurturing *Gēng* Vermilion**
Take coarse vermilion, boil it in the previous medicinal vinegar as before. After one day, remove and wash it. Then take the *jiǔ yī Gēng* (nine-to-one *Gēng*) cinnabar pellets, grind them finely, and wrap each piece in honey-refined cinnabar, ensuring the wrapping is thick and conceals the substance entirely.

Dry the crucible until the honey hardens. Then attach four *liang* of the previous fine alum to the top and bottom, sealing it as before. Nurture it with fire, following the previous regimen.

Once cooled, open it—the vermilion will have penetrated bone by bone, transforming into *Gēng*, suitable for the Great Elixir, known as *Jīndān* (Golden Elixir).

If one wishes to forge *Gēng*, mix mother cinnabar with [blank] and smelt it evenly, then it becomes superior *Shén Gēng* cinnabar—a worldly treasure, with mercury as its essence.

**Twelfth Transformation: Reiterating the Method for Crafting the Elixir’s Embryo**
The yellow sprout should be made as before, though it may be costly. Instead, take sixteen *liang* of fully refined gold, smelt and grind it into powder.

Next, use the previous lead crucible to produce ten *liang* of yellow sprout arsenic, refining it once in a silver crucible. Then mix it evenly with gold powder, seal it in a water-fire crucible, and apply fire from *Wén* to *Wǔ* (gradual to intense). Use one *jin* of fire, smelting for a day and night. The next day, remove it, grind it evenly with gold powder, and gradually add it to the red mother crucible, lowering it bit by bit. Cover the mouth with a *wǎqián* (coin-sized lid), ensuring no ash enters.

Once the fire is exhausted, place the crucible on cold ashes. When cooled, open it—the embryo will naturally separate. Discard the gold and take only the ten *liang* of yellow sprout arsenic to transform and nurture the Great Elixir.

**Thirteenth Transformation: Method for Transforming and Nurturing *Gēng* Cinnabar**
Take four *liang* of clear, ash-free vermilion and cinnabar, boiled in the previous *Gēng* cinnabar medicinal vinegar. Wrap it in gold foil, then cover it with the previous ten *liang* of yellow sprout powder. Place it in the vessel, seal it tightly, let it dry, and place it in an ash pit. Apply three *liang* of fire at the top for seven days of nurturing.

Then apply four *liang* of fire for another seven days. Increase the fire to two *jin*. Once cooled, remove it, grind it evenly with the alum, and seal it again in a water-fire crucible. Smelt it for half a day, then remove and grind it finely.

Next, heat a sweet crucible until red-hot, gradually adding the liquid to form gold essence. Place the crucible on cold ashes, and when cooled, the embryo will naturally separate. Discard the yellow sprout arsenic and retain only the four *liang* of cinnabar.

**Fourteenth Transformation: Method for Nurturing *Gēng* Sprout**
Take the previous four *liang* of cinnabar, grind it, and mix it with one *liang* of *èrbā Gēng* (two-to-eight *Gēng*) cinnabar. Boil it as before, then place it in the cinnabar vessel, sealing it tightly in a water-fire crucible. Apply two *liang* of fire at the bottom and two *liang* of inserted fire for nine days of nurturing.

Increase the fire to half a *jin*, surrounding it with rotating flames. Once the fire is exhausted, remove it—the sprout will have turned into a treasure color.

Repeat this process with apricot kernels several times, blending it with cinnabar and *Gēng* until it reaches eight *liang*. The remaining two *liang* will be *jiǔ yī Gēng* cinnabar.

**Fifteenth Transformation: Method for Mixing Embryos to Form Gold and Mercury**
Grind the cinnabar and cinnabar pellets evenly, nurture them for half a month, then remove and mix them with ten *liang* of yellow sprout arsenic. Grind them finely, seal them in a water-fire crucible, let it dry, and smelt with intense fire for a day and night. The next day, remove it, grind it into powder, and repeat the process to form a liquid. Place it in a crucible on cold ashes, and when cooled, the cinnabar and cinnabar will naturally separate, forming the Great Elixir *Gēng* medicine.

**Sixteenth Transformation: Method for Nurturing the Yin-Yang Embryos**
Remove the arsenic and use only the *Gēng* cinnabar vessel. The mercury will then dry naturally.

**Yin-Yang and Sulfur (二两 each)**, grind evenly, refine with honey into a cake, then place within the yellow sprout arsenic vessel. Seal and nurture for forty-nine days. When removed, it will be truly dead.

Combine with the previous eight *liang* of cinnabar, grind evenly, and smelt in a water-fire crucible for a day and night. Remove, grind into powder, and boil twelve *liang* in medicinal vinegar. Add three *liang* of sulfur, seal with lotus mud, and nurture with fire for twenty-one days. Add half a *liang* of fire, then remove—it will become a fine powder. This is the Great Elixir medicine.

**Seventeenth Transformation: Method for Scattering Mercury into *Gēng* (Cinnabar)**
Four *liang* of cinnabar, boiled in medicinal vinegar, with one *jin* of medicinal powder. Pierce a hole, insert mercury, seal, and nurture for seven or nine days. When removed, it will fully transform into *Gēng* treasure.

**Eighteenth Transformation: Method for Scattering and Alchemical Pointing**
Take four *liang* of dead mercury, apply yellow sprout arsenic to its head, and smelt into a liquid. Remove the arsenic, then refine the mercury treasure into a *hun-tun* (chaotic egg) of one *jin*, shaped like the primordial chaos. Place one *liang* of cinnabar inside, then cover externally with yellow sprout arsenic, sealing it completely—thick enough to cover two fingers—so that nothing is exposed. Dry it thoroughly, then place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for forty-nine days. When removed, it will be truly dead.

This method transmutes the Five Metals and refines worldly mercury—its full process cannot be fully described.

**Golden Elixir Method**
Use only one ingredient: dead mercury gold. Add one *liang* of cinnabar, place within the *hun-tun* vessel, seal externally with medicinal mud, and apply the *zhou-tian* (circular elixir) fire regimen—advancing, retreating, refining, and bathing—following the method for one year. The Great Elixir will then be complete, hence its name: *Golden Elixir*.

Divide one *liang* into 360 grains. Each grain, when refined into ten *liang* of dry mercury, will become the supreme purple-gold treasure.

**Method for Extracting Purple *Gēng* from Malachite**
One *jin* of malachite, four *liang* of gallstone, half a *liang* of sulfur, and two *liang* of ochre. Grind into powder, melt in a sweet crucible with intense fire until it becomes a liquid, then pour out to form *Gēng*.

**Cold Yellow Refining Divine Cinnabar**
Take two *liang* of yin (sulfur), half a *liang* of sulfur, and one *liang* of oyster shell. Place the yin in a vessel, cover with oyster powder, seal tightly, and dry. Nurture with four *liang* of fire for one *fu* period. Grind finely, wash with water to remove oyster ash, dry, and roast again. Refine the sulfur into a liquid, let it cool, and remove.

Grind into wax pills the size of *cíyù* (a type of tuber). Each pill is applied to one *liang* of black lead—its color will be exquisite.

**True Dead Borax**
One *liang* of borax, with one *liang* each of *héngxuàn* grass and *fángfēng* root. Seal in a crucible and calcine until glowing red. Place the borax inside, cover with a porcelain plate, and smelt into a liquid.

**Dead Saltpeter**
Use croton seed and soapnut to fumigate the crucible, leaving some seeds mixed with saltpeter. Burn until the crucible turns red, then pour the saltpeter into it and fan into a liquid.

**Another Cold Yellow Method**
Half a *jin* of black lead, melted into a liquid. Add half a *liang* each of *qīngshèng* (a mineral), *xīpēng* (a mineral), and sulfur, along with three *qián* of arsenic. Roast until purple—this is the *dan-tóu* (elixir head). Apply one *qián* of *dan-tóu* to ten *fen* of lead, turning it red.

**Method for Crafting the Elixir Head**
One *liang* of yin (sulfur), two *qián* and a half of sulfur. Grind finely, wrap in silk, then tightly bind with seaweed. Seal with magnetite powder mixed with honey, and use *làliáo* pitch as the vessel. Nurture for ten days, applying two *liang* of fire each morning and evening.

When the fire is complete, remove it—it will be effective when applied.

Half a *qián* of sulfur, two *qián* and a half of gallstone, six *qián* of alum, half a *liang* of ochre, half a *liang* of gold clay, half a *liang* of saltpeter, four *qián* and a half of green vitriol, and half a *qián* of green salt. Grind into fine powder, mix with a little brine, and dry until it resembles tea dregs. Spread as a base and cover, then press with food salt. Use ten or so pieces of charcoal, ignite until glowing red, and burn until the fire is exhausted.

**Hidden Method (Alternative Prescription)**
One *qián* and a half of sulfur, one *qián* of seaweed, one *qián* of alum, one *qián* of green salt, and half a *qián* of saltpeter, along with *tiānzhú* yellow (orpiment). One *qián* of green vitriol, one *qián* and a half of gallstone, and one *qián* of salt crystal. Grind into fine powder—one *qián* of each—spread medicinal powder above and below, cover with food salt, and smelt with intense fire into a liquid. This is marvelous.

**Another Printing Method**
One *jin* of black tin, mixed with one *dou* of quail dung in water, then filtered to remove sand and soil.

Melt the lead in a crucible until it becomes a liquid, then pour into the quail dung solution. Remove when it turns white, and shape into sheets.

Mix equal parts of realgar and orpiment, grind finely.

Use a pearl ash vessel, apply *cāibí* (a type of grass) nasal oil inside, dry, and place the realgar-orpiment powder within. Cover with four or five pieces of medicinal grass, seal tightly, and dry. Place in an ash pit and nurture with three *liang* of fire for three days.

Remove, grind finely, and place in the vessel. Layer one sheet of lead, then one layer of realgar-orpiment powder, repeating until full. Pack tightly, seal the vessel with mud, and smelt with five *jin* of fire.

Remove, melt the black lead until it turns yellow, then shape as desired—its appearance will be excellent.

**Another Method**
Half a *liang* of yin (sulfur), one *fen* each of sulfur and arsenic. First grind the yin, then separately grind the arsenic and sulfur into powder.

Take one egg, pierce a hole, remove the yolk, and keep the clear liquid. Place half of the arsenic-sulfur mixture at the bottom, then place the yin in the center, and cover with the remaining arsenic-sulfur mixture.

Use half of the eggshell to cover the opening, seal with green vitriol water, and close tightly. Place one *jin* of yellow cinnabar in an iron crucible, arrange half inside, place the egg medicine in the center, then cover with the remaining yellow cinnabar, pressing slightly. Fill the gaps with lime, seal tightly.

Use half a *liang* of charcoal in an ash pit to nurture. When removed, the process will be complete.

**Method of Refining Lead into Elixir**

For every *liang* of white tin, use small mung beans in size. First melt into liquid, then add the medicine dropwise. Drain and wait for cooling—it will immediately become golden.

**Cultivating Lead with Sulfur**
Sulfur in any quantity: use fish-vine (*Houttuynia cordata*) and sour-vine (*Veronica didyma*) juices, crush and steep. Boil and grind finely, then drip sulfur into the mixture. Boil for three days, dry, and place in a crucible. Use ten cloves of garlic, crush and press into the top. Seal with brine-mixed oyster-shell powder, bind with iron wire, and seal with salt mud. Place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for seven days.

- Days 1–2: Use two *liang* of fire, split into two blocks (four *liang* total).
- Days 3–5: Use three *liang*.
- Days 6–7: Top with two *liang*, base with two *liang*.
- Day 7: Top with four *liang*, base with four *liang*.

**Dead Lead**
Take *Hu Sun* (possibly *Aristolochia debilis*) juice, drip and parch to powder. Layer in the sulfur crucible, seal, and nurture with four *liang* of fire for five days. Remove when brittle—this is the measure. If not brittle, it will fail later; recultivate until brittle.

Once removed, remelt into liquid. Use *Hou Dan* (post-cinnabar) to drop onto one *liang* of lead, transforming its bones. For final alchemy, use *Hou Mu Sha* (post-mercury) to complete the elixir. For every five *liang* of lead, use one *liang* of *Mu Sha*—this also yields *Mu Sha*.

**Cultivating *Mu Sha* (Mercury)**
When *San Qi Mu Sha* (three-seven mercury) solidifies, layer crushed lotus root (*Nelumbo nucifera*) over it, place in an oil jar without covering with lead. Seal and wait until the lotus root is fully decomposed. Remove.

Next, use fivefold gallnuts (*Rhus chinensis*), aged mulberry leaves, and vinegar to coat and layer in the jar as before. Wait until smoke ceases, then remove the *Mu Sha*. Wrap in *Kunlun* paper (four *liang*), nurture with fire for one *qi* (seven days), using two *liang* of fire each day.

**Preparing *Dan Tou* (Cinnabar Head) for Lead**
As for *Jin Ding Pi* (gold furnace arsenic), one *liang*, with three *qian* of frankincense, grind finely. Crush five cloves of garlic, steep in water to extract green juice (one bowl), strain, and drip-cook with arsenic-frankincense. Dry thoroughly. Place in a water-fire crucible, pound three times with water until dry. When pounding, press with garlic; use raw arsenic only. *Jin Ding Pi* arsenic cannot be fully refined.

Equal parts *yin* (sulfur) and *yang* (mercury), one *liang* each. Boil in a bottle of brine for one day to remove lead’s toxicity. If no brine, boil in clean water, rinse with boiling water to remove black residue, and parch dry. Next, boil *yin* in large-leaf mugwort for one day, then in raw *Rehmannia* for one day, and parch dry.

**Dead Sulfur**
Decoct *Iron Tower Grass* (*Siegesbeckia orientalis*) juice, drip-cook in a *jian* cup for half a day. Layer crushed *Iron Tower Grass* in a sweet crucible, cover with a porcelain plate, seal, and nurture in ash until liquid forms. Top with five *liang* of fire; once cooled, remove and discard the grass ash.

**Dead Saltpeter**
Fumigate the crucible with soapberry (*Gleditsia sinensis*), sprinkle saltpeter to form liquid, then add licorice root. Pour into a trough. For every half *liang* of dead saltpeter, add half *liang* of dead sulfur and one *liang* of *Mu Li* (oyster shell). If unavailable, substitute with wood from *Yang Liu* (willow) or *Mu E* (duck tree). Grind into powder, drip-cook in a *jian* cup with lake water for one day. Dry, add half *liang* of *Mu Li* powder, mix, and place in a crucible. Pound gently with one *jian* cup of water until dry.

Combine these five refined substances to form the *Dan Tou*, then drop onto lead to complete the elixir.

**Alternative Method**
Seven *qian* of *mao* (hemp), seven *qian* of tin, half *qian* of arsenic, five *qian* of alum, and five *qian* of cinnabar (*Zhu Sha*). In a sweet crucible, first add hemp, then tin, then arsenic and alum powder, and finally cinnabar. Melt into liquid, pour into an oil trough to form the elixir.
