**Tongyou Jue**

**Scripture Title:** *Tongyou Jue* (*The Formula for Penetrating the Mysteries*). The author is unknown, approximately dating to the Tang or Song dynasties. It records both internal and external alchemical formulas. One fascicle.

**Source of the Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (*Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*), *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.

**The Formula States:**

The treasure elixir fundamentally arises from the One, which then generates the Two. The Two governs Fire, residing in *bing* and *ding*, born of *jia*. At the *Initial Nine*, the *Hidden Dragon* first line emerges, establishing Yang in the *zi* position. The *Celestial Tally* releases and disperses, startling the mat to receive qi from the Mother. The Mother is Earth.

The Dao is born of the One; the One generates the Two; the Two generates the Three. The Three are the ultimate parents of Yang. Yang is the essence of Heaven and Earth, thus called the *Three-Five and One*—the fundamental basis of the Returned Elixir.

The *Celestial Tally* is the *solar sign*. The Sun is the primordial essence of Heaven and Earth, the first illumination of the Five Phases. Its radiance follows the affairs of the day; the day follows the month; the month follows the seasons; the seasons follow the years—thus measuring distance and distinguishing differences.

At the initial division of the primordial qi of Chaos into Yin and Yang, the Dipper establishes the Twelve Branches, shifting and revolving without cease. The clepsydra never halts; release and union alternate, and the myriad things transform and take form.

The *Celestial Tally* is the sign. It can release and disperse the myriad things, moving them to return to their root and become essence and qi. Subtle movement congeals into essence; essence transforms into cinnabar. Its color inherits the *bing-ding* Fire of the South—externally Yang yet internally Yin—ruling the male, the Yang soul of the Sun.

The radiant qi of the Sun and Moon illuminates Heaven and Earth. The harmonious qi of the Great Yang and Great Yin intermingle and ascend, receiving qi. After 1,080 years, essence and qi congeal. When the *Celestial Tally* shines upon cinnabar for another 1,080 years, it becomes cinnabar, called *Zhusha* (Vermilion Sand).

Yang within Yin is named the *Great Yang* and *Vermilion Bird Stone*, ruling Water. The primordial harmonious qi is not yet sufficient—this is the *solar cinnabar*. The *Celestial Lead* of the ten thousand heavens, the essence of the *Imperial Male*, the blood of the *Dragon Maiden*, transforms South into North, extracting the untransformed Yin Mercury, ruling Water. Water’s number is One, thus it is said that Mercury is born of Lead, and Yang serves as the minister.

The *Celestial Lead* and *Divine Water*, driven by the *Celestial Tally*, illuminate cinnabar, nurturing it for another 1,080 years. Heavenly Fire transforms it into the Great Yang; Yang qi becomes sufficient while Yin qi wanes. When Yang qi flourishes and overflows, it turns back and generates its own color, inheriting the *ren-gui* Water of the North—externally Yin yet internally Yang—ruling the female, the Yin soul of the Moon. It is no ordinary substance of the human realm.

Thus, that which arises naturally in the Red Water is called *Yang Mercury*, the essence of *Celestial Lead* and the ancestor of the *Yellow Sprout*. It is the radiant qi-water of the Sun and Moon, transformed into the *Natural Returned Elixir*. When the *Celestial Tally* shines upon it for another 1,080 years—totaling 4,320 years—primordial qi becomes sufficient, and the Returned Elixir forms naturally.

The naturally subdued Fire is black in color, turning from North to West. West rules Metal, and Metal’s number is Four, the foundation of Water. Thus, we know the *Three-Five and One* are the supreme essences of Heaven and Earth. The Three is Fire; the Five are the parents of cinnabar; the One is the primordial ancestor of cinnabar.

The cycle revolves and turns; essence and primordial harmony interact to form shapes, never exceeding the One. The One is the fundamental origin of the Dao—Water.

Scholars fail to realize that cinnabar is Lead, and the child born within Lead is Gold. It is but a single thing of Yin and Yang, moving and self-regulating. Yang within Yin, Yin within Yang, Mystery within Mystery—this is called the *Mysterious Warrior Stone*, turning Water into Gold.

Thus it is said: *Cinnabar is produced from the Yin of Metal, serving as the ruler and refining agent of Gold.* When the *Celestial Tally* moves, totaling 4,320 years of illumination, the parents nurture and form *Celestial Lead*, the *Natural Returned Elixir*.

**The Formula States:**

Later sages used Fire to illustrate the line images. A month comprises 360 hours; a year comprises 4,320 hours of qi and seasons. Combined, they total 4,320 years—when qi and seasons align, the *Celestial Tally* naturally forms the Returned Elixir.

Thus it is said: *Vermilion Sand, Mercury, Gold, Water, Dragon and Tiger, the Five Phases—united in body, returning to the One, no duality, attaining the Five.* By following the *Earthly Tally* and the hexagrams’ seasonal nodes, the Golden Elixir is accomplished.

**The Formula States:**

The essence-soul of this cinnabar emerges from within the Twelve Divisions of China, ruling the *First Palace* in the southwest corner of *Kun* Earth. This treasure is the supreme essence and primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Through the movement of the Sun, Moon, and *Celestial Tally*, union occurs in the Five. The Five is *wu-ji*, the central palace of Earth.

The places where it is born possess auspicious mountains and ridges, where qi, bones, and flesh are complete. Water and land flourish with lush grasses and trees; soil and stone are firm and extraordinary. Spirits guard and attend; Yin qi bestows, and Yang qi disperses. Enveloping and nurturing, illuminating essence and qi, it is born of Earth and transforms into cinnabar.

Where cinnabar exists, whether day or night, after initial clearing or during overcast moments, qi and radiance often appear, resembling sunlight emerging, sometimes vanishing, sometimes visible—discernible only to the adept miner.

Herein are recorded the names of the mountains, valleys, and administrative regions where it is produced, along with its various appellations:

*Cinnabar, Vermilion Sand, Vermilion Lead, Gold within Lead, Celestial Lead, Fire Lead, Divine Water, Radiant Pool, Yin Mercury, Yang Mercury, Yang within Yin, Yin within Yang, Quicksilver, Five-Colored Stone, Five Metals, Lord of the Seven Treasures, Returned Elixir, Heaven-Born Sprout, Yellow Sprout, Embryo of the Five Phases.*

**Names of Administrative Regions, Mountains, and Valleys:**

*Guifu, Chen, Jin, Heng, Lang, Shao, Goulou, Duyun, Xiangdu, Yong, Bang, Rong*, and the borders of *Hunan*, among other places. In the mountains, rocks, and valleys where terrain and vegetation flourish, it is found.

If one seeks the essence of cinnabar without refinement—naturally self-generated—simply search in previously mined areas, where stones have been struck or cavities filled, regardless of whether they are new or old; it will be present.

Newly opened mines and ancient ones do not necessarily yield it. When cinnabar glows radiantly upon the matrix, with a natural hierarchy of lord and minister on all four sides, or when it grows in obeisant clusters—its hue like an unopened red lotus, translucent and luminous as the sun, or resembling hibiscus, purple and diaphanous, its form like a zither; or when it appears in well-defined flakes with sharp edges, clearly lustrous—these are all of the highest grade. Or when it resembles mica sheets, white and translucent (also called "white horse’s tooth"), or occurs in granules of two or three, even weighing one or two catties, extracted from stone, with granules of bright red, fragmented brilliance. Or when it appears in flakes with sharp edges and white luster, invisible when submerged in water. Or when it exhibits a clear blue-green luster with well-formed edges—these are all of the middle grade. Though used similarly to the highest grade, they suffice as supreme medicine. Varieties with an iron-like hue, or those gathered from bamboo-lined valleys, earthen caves, or water, with granules of indeterminate weight, or mere handfuls of powdered cinnabar, are of the lowest grade. Though the land’s veins may flourish and their essence be drawn and subdued, they serve only to cure worldly ailments, not to prolong life, and are unfit as supreme medicine.

This is akin to the ranks of officials: the highest and middle grades hold titles, while those without are common. The lowly lack autonomy and cannot achieve extraordinary feats. Hence the saying: "They only cure worldly ailments, not prolong life."

**Heavenly Talisman: The Sun.**
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* speaks of the sun as the "Heavenly Talisman." The sun is the essence and spirit of yang, the principle of heaven, thus its radiant illumination. *The Master of Huainan* states: "The accumulated heat of yang qi surges and transforms into fire. The essence of fire is the sun, embodying the power of luminous brilliance." It also says: "The sun is born in *jia*, the position of double yang. Fire is born in *zhen*, the *chen-si* position. *Zhen* is the eldest son, *xun* the middle son—they are the parents of southern fire. Fire is called *ceng*, wood is called *qing*; they are the agents of all things, hence the term *cengqing*."

**Earthly Talisman: The Moon.**
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* refers to the moon as the "Earthly Talisman." The moon is the essence and spirit of yin, the principle of earth, casting its singular luminous glow. *The Master of Huainan* states: "The accumulated cold of yin qi surges and transforms into water. The essence of water is the moon, which waxes and wanes in response to the sun." It also says: "The moon is born in *geng*, the position of double yin. Water is born in *dui*, the youngest daughter—they are the parents of water. Thus, men stand to the east of the sun, while women, like the moon, rise in the west."

The cinnabar of the alchemical path is the radiant essence of the sun and moon, the root of life and destiny. In harmony with the inner and outer primal forces, it assumes form through transformation. Ingesting it grants immortality, for it is the union of the sun and moon’s essences—hence the term "Earthly Talisman." The moon’s birth and the sun’s nurturance depend on yin and yang’s workings, which in turn rely on their mother: earth. The sun and moon are the most numinous treasures of heaven and earth. When base emotions stir their essences, they transform and illuminate, coalescing into cinnabar, first called the "Vermilion Bird Stone." Among the seventy-two stones, none surpasses mercury. Responsive to the twenty-four qi and corresponding to the twenty-four names, it transmutes into the Elixir. When crows consume it, they become phoenixes; when serpents ingest it, they become dragons; when humans partake, they attain longevity, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth. It gathers the hun and po souls, reverses aging to return to youth, summons wind and clouds, and commands jade maidens to attend—such is the power of the Great Elixir.

The formula states: Lead is the liquid drawn from cinnabar, ruling water, yang within yin—mercury. That which naturally emerges from cinnabar rules metal, yin within yang—mercury. The formula states: Thus, the unyielding wood is subdued by metal. When metal nurtures water, water must preserve metal. When wood nurtures fire, fire must rely on wood. Therefore, lead-water governs mercury-water, and lead-fire governs mercury-fire, harmonizing their natures and forms.

The formula states: Lead-water is that which naturally emerges from cinnabar, ruling yang mercury. Mercury-water is the liquid drawn from water, ruling yin mercury. Thus, lead-water governs mercury-water. It also says: Lead-fire is self-generated metal. Mercury-fire is the drawn liquid. Water is lead-fire governing mercury-fire. Many fail to grasp this, hence the term "Golden Mercury Dao."

The sun is the fire essence of Great Yang—vermilion mercury, the Dragon. The moon is the water essence of Great Yin—lead-silver, the Tiger. The Dragon is the qi of yang, the utmost of the number nine, the non-being of wood. The Tiger is the qi of yin, the utmost of the number four, the being of metal. The formula states: "Use non-being to govern being, and the Dao is complete." Hence it is said: "Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal. In perfect balance, it becomes supremely sacred and numinous." Yet the world does not awaken; people see gold and regard it as mere earth.

The *Song of the Elixir* says:
The Great Mystery and Earthly Talisman give birth to yin and yang.
Yin and yang generate the Five Phases, which unite to form the Returned Elixir—
Hence the names Dragon and Tiger.
Heaven has three revered: the sun, moon, and stars.
Earth has three revered: the rivers, lakes, and seas.
Humans have three revered: ruler, father, and teacher.
The body has three revered: the Three Elixir Fields.
The Elixir has three revered: earth, fire, and metal.
Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* are the father and mother above and below.
*Kan* and *Li* are water and fire as medicine.
*Zhen* and *Xun* are the moving trigrams.
After three years of circulation, the Elixir naturally returns—
This is the qi of the Great Origin; how could it not become the Elixir?

The formula states: Calculate 12,960 hours, excluding the varying lengths of months and intercalary months, to arrive at the true count. If even one qi is lacking, it is no different from worthless rubble. When the myriad phenomena’s essences align, the numinous naturally resonates.

The formula states:
Yin and Yang revolve, qi transforms into essence,
essence into cinnabar, cinnabar into mercury,
mercury into gold, gold into medicine—
thus called "golden sand," named the Great Return.
The Great Return means the meaning of returning.
"Elixir" is the name of the red color.
"Mercury" is fundamentally gold;
gold and water restrain each other,
hence called "golden sand."
When the fundamental body is refined, it is called the Great Return Elixir.
Earth is the Yin tally, the central palace of Wu and Ji,
also called the Five Qi Golden Crucible.

The formula states:
The Five Qi restrain and subdue without flying,
able to generate the Five Colors,
returning to their mother—
ingested, they grant longevity.

The formula states:
Cinnabar is the father of flowing mercury.
Wu and Ji are the mother of yellow gold.
The mother’s number is five; five is earth.
Using earth as the crucible,
its restraining power is called the Golden Crucible.
Earth can generate the myriad things;
gold is born of earth, thus it is the father of gold.
The mother is gold’s fundamental origin in earth,
hence called the earth mother.
Water regards earth as its ghost—
earth fills water so it does not rise.
The merit of Wu and Ji is called the Five Tally Golden Crucible.
Mercury cannot be subdued without earth.
Earth rules the realm of metal;
the three substances all seek it,
following the image of the emperor and king.
As when a ruler has the Dao, the four directions come to offer tribute.
Simply discern the true lead and mercury—
this is the primary crucible method.
Thus, the three substances form one family,
all returning to Wu and Ji.
Without earth to govern, gold and water cannot form the Elixir.

The earth mother reigns for eighteen days in each season;
the remaining days are abandoned, imprisoned, or concealed.
In refining the Golden Crucible,
investigate Yin and Yang,
the essence and qi returning—
the clepsydra does not cease.
Realgar is likened to earth, pacifying the four barbarians.
Earth is the fundamental soil that generates gold.
"Xiong" means male; "huang" means earth.
It can suppress water and earth—
this is metal and fire, unrelated to realgar.
The crucible’s outer master is called the Five Tally.

The world does not awaken to the Elixir’s fundamental father and mother,
mistakenly using gold and silver as the mother
or as crucible vessels.
Thus, the primordial qi does not depart from the Five,
and the Five do not depart from the primordial qi.
Their names are blended as one,
but their functions differ when distinguished.
The primordial qi is the ruler of the Five Agents;
the Five Agents are the ministers of the primordial qi.
Ruler and ministers govern in tandem—
they cannot be separated.
The Golden Elixir employs the primordial qi,
not exceeding the Five.
The Five are the Five Tally.
The Five Tally are qi.
Qi is originally formless,
born from essence,
containing truth within and without.
When ingested, one neither dies nor is born.

The Golden Crucible is the outer control of the medicine—
the outer is qi, the control is the crucible.
The crucible resembles a hen’s egg,
white outside encasing yellow,
combined with mercury—
using white gold as the vessel,
the vessel does not depart from the Five.
The Five are earth, the earth that generates gold.
Through intricate mutual restraint,
it seems effortless,
preventing water from escaping—
this is the merit of Wu and Ji.

The formula states:
Grasp the sword, lay down the halberd,
encompassing the four directions.
Grasping the sword is the primordial qi of metal, the Five.
Laying down the weapons—
like water meeting earth and not flowing—
this is gold dying in earth.

The foundation of the Great Elixir is cinnabar.
Cinnabar is lead,
fundamentally born of earth,
and in death also returns to earth—
thus, use the earth that generates cinnabar.
The world knows this in number.

The crucible has alternate names:
Outer Spirit Water, Flowery Pond, Spirit Chamber,
Enclosing Frame, Outer Control, Five Qi,
White Robe, Elixir Robe, Mother’s Abode,
Golden Crucible, Spirit Hut.

The formula states:
The Five Qi—
in greatness, they encompass the eight directions;
in smallness, they conceal even a hair’s tip.
They spit forth Kun and vomit forth Xu,
emerging from existence, entering non-existence.

The formula states:
The flowing pearl revolves nine times,
transforming into yellow and white.
Naturally interacting,
one Yin, one Yang—
this is called the Dao.
It must be subdued within the Golden Crucible,
the merit of the central palace.
Spiritual penetration is free and unobstructed,
nurturing and subduing—
hence called the Golden Crucible.

The Golden Elixir is the primordial harmonious qi of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon.
Shining and silently revolving,
it becomes cinnabar.
Within the sand, it spontaneously generates—
this is the Return Elixir.
Like humans conceiving sons and daughters,
all arise from the union of father and mother’s Yin-Yang essence and qi—
thus, the Return Elixir resembles male and female.
Males are born facing downward; females, upward.
Not only in life—
even in death, it is so.
Simply cast them into water:
males float downward, females upward.
Heaven causes this—
it is not by the parents’ instruction.

Gold and water within the crucible
resemble male and female playing,
male above, female below,
naturally attaining mutual affinity,
fulfilling the Dao.

The formula states:
Though the Golden Elixir obtains its primordial foundation,
one must know the nurturing and subduing of its fundamental father and mother.
The father is the Yang qi of fire—
the father can emit, move, and complete it.
The mother is the Yin qi of earth—
the mother can contain and nurture it.
The mother rules the central palace, yellow—
yellow is earth, the earth that generates gold.
When cinnabar first receives qi,
it relies on earth to be born—
thus, it is called the fundamental mother of the yellow sprout.
Formed by Yang, born by the mother—
hence named the earth cauldron, the mother.

Earth is the earth of the Five Agents,
the earth of generation and completion.
Water, fire, wood, metal, earth—
each resides in its direction,
moving to its proper position.
Fire comes to overcome metal;
earth comes to overcome water.
Water is the child of cinnabar.
Earth is the crucible.
Fire is movement, contending—
yet forming shape, obtaining earth’s generation.
Earth can restrain water;
the fundamental qi resonate,
becoming the ancestral Dao.
Thus it is said: Know the white, guard the black.

The world entirely does not know that like kinds
follow and generate each other,
overcome and restrain each other—
metal generates water,
earth is the ghost of water.
Earth fills water so it does not rise—
the merit of Wu and Ji is called the Five Tally Golden Crucible.
None among the world’s people know this.
Earth tally is the essence of fire and wood.

The formula states: The earth tally is fire.
Fire can cook and ripen the myriad things,
nurturing the people.
Fire is the root yang qi of *jia*,
conjoining and uniting with the essence qi of sun and moon,
returning to the undivided essence of *jia*.
Fire’s number is two; its generating number, three; its completing number, nine.
Nine is the extreme number of yang—yang qi.
*Jia* is called *zeng*; wood is called *qing*.
The agent of all things, the Azure Dragon of the East—wood.
Wood is the parent of fire; fire and wood, its descendants.
*Zhen* is the eldest son, born of one yang line;
*Xun* the middle son, born of two yang lines—
thus fire is born in *chen* and *si*.
*Li* is the middle daughter, born of two yang lines.
Yang *bing* resides in the *zi* position.
Wood conceives fire and restrains it;
fire must borrow from wood.
Three is the essence of wood, the Way of true yang,
the position of *jia* and *yi*—the sun.

The celestial tally is trust, able to activate and release the myriad things.
The moon, a yin tally, can nurture the myriad things.
Earth, a yin tally, can nurture the myriad things.
Fire, an earth tally, can cook and ripen the myriad things.
The primordial qi of metal and water, likewise yin tallies,
can nurture the myriad things.

*The Straight Tally Hand Mirror* compares the sixty-four hexagrams of sun and moon,
the six lines activating and releasing,
the celestial tally—
thus forming the golden elixir.
Ingesting it, one ascends in feathered transformation—
the power of *Ziming*.

The Perfected Lord of the Primordial Emperor,
whose name has changed through the ages,
has summarized the subtleties of yin and yang,
the mutual resonance of the Five Phases,
the line images of the *Zhouyi*,
and the straight tally of *Can Si*—
like tally and contract, perfectly aligned.
Observing the cycles of heaven and earth,
the revolutions of yin and yang,
the proper positions of *zi* and *wu*,
the mutual gazing of *mao* and *you*:
In the eleventh month, the first yang arises—
the myriad things are born.
In the fifth month, the first yin arises—
the myriad things take form.

Spring gives life, autumn brings harvest—such is the natural Dao.
The formula states: Use fire gently, without missing the seasonal nodes.
The myriad things ripen of themselves—this is the meaning of the *River Chariot*.

The formula states: *Zi* governs the fire-tally, first in withdrawal and addition.
One says: *River* is the northern position.
*Chariot* means the conveyance of burdens.
Another says: *Zi* is metal, *River* is water—hence *Zi River Chariot*.

**Earth-Tally Straight Hexagram Seasonal Advance-Retreat Diagram**
The formula states: Originally employing the four hexagrams,
the sun and moon through the four seasons,
the straight tally cycles endlessly—
like the wheels of a chariot,
revolving yin and yang,
completing the numbers of creation,
bearing and conveying the myriad things.
Thus, in the pitch-pipes and monthly nodes,
there are five and six taboos,
honoring the solar terms and their combinations.

The sixty-four hexagrams,
hard and soft with outer and inner,
at dawn the long day begins with the hexagram of duty,
by dusk the receptive takes its turn—
day and night each employ one hexagram.
The sequence, having reached its end at the dark of the moon,
renews itself with advancing and retreating line images,
all within this straight tally.

From one to nine,
the Metal Tiger spits forth essence—
the formula for the straight tally is not recorded here.

The formula states: Borrowing the yin-yang line images,
the sixty-four hexagrams establish their metaphors.
When deploying fire for release,
it is the eleventh month that governs,
receiving the yang seasonal tally.

**Eleventh month, first nine:**
"The hidden dragon does not act."
*Earth-Thunder Fu* (Return), aligned with *Yu* (Enthusiasm).

**Twelfth month, second nine:**
"The dragon appears in the field."
*Earth-Marsh Lin* (Approach), aligned with *Cui* (Gathering).

**First month, third nine:**
"The noble one toils ceaselessly all day."
*Earth-Heaven Tai* (Peace), aligned with *Pi* (Stagnation).

**Second month, fourth nine:**
"Perhaps leaping in the abyss."
*Heaven-Thunder Wuwang* (Innocence), aligned with *Dazhuang* (Great Strength).

**Third month, fifth nine:**
"The flying dragon is in the heavens."
*Heaven-Marsh Lü* (Treading), aligned with *Fu* (The Gentle).

**Fourth month, upper nine:**
"The exalted dragon has regrets."
*Pure Qian* (The Creative) governs—yang qi surges and intermingles.

**Right: The Six Yang Positions**
The yang arises to its extreme—
the hexagram of the exalted dragon, *Great Excess*—
modeled on heaven,
thus from *zi* to *si*.

**Fifth month, first yin arises.**
*Heaven-Wind Gu* (The Taming Power of the Small), aligned with *Xiaoxu* (Small Accumulation).

**Sixth month, second yin arises.**
*Heaven-Mountain Dun* (Retreat), aligned with *Daxu* (Great Accumulation).

**Seventh month, third yin arises.**
*Heaven-Earth Pi* (Stagnation), aligned with *Tai* (Peace).

**Eighth month, fourth yin arises.**
*Wind-Earth Guan* (Contemplation), aligned with *Sheng* (Ascending).

**Ninth month, fifth yin arises.**
*Mountain-Earth Bo* (Splitting Apart), aligned with *Qian* (Modesty).

**Tenth month, sixth yin arises.**
*Pure Kun* (The Receptive) governs.

**Right: The Six Yin Positions**
The yin arises to its extreme—
the hexagram of qi lying hidden,
modeled on earth,
thus from *wu* to *hai*.

**Zhen** governs spring wood:
generating three, completing eight.

**Li** governs summer fire:
generating two, completing seven.

The formula states: Verifying the preceding fifteen days as white,
the moon’s fire and wood govern—hence seven and eight.

**Dui** governs autumn metal:
generating four, completing nine.

**Kan** governs winter water:
generating one, completing six.

The formula states: Verifying the following fifteen days as black,
the moon’s metal and water govern—hence nine and six.

All are the straight tally’s six lines,
employing hexagram nodes to interpret qi and seasons,
the numbers of the Five Phases overcoming one another.
Thus, seven and eight sum to fifteen,
nine and six likewise correspond—
the Dao is complete.

One, two, three, four, five—
all are the foundations of the Five Phases.

The formula states:
One is the northern *ren gui* water.
Two is the southern *bing ding* fire.
Three is the eastern *jia yi* wood.
Four is the western *geng xin* metal.
Five is the central *wu ji* earth.

The classic states: "The father is young, the child is old."
The father is celestial lead—
cinnabar lead.
The child emerges from the father—
black lead of metal.
Thus, the father is young, the child is old.

If the child is not fixed, the father’s lineage spans five generations.
Water, fire, metal, wood, earth—
the Five Phases shift and transform the myriad things.
Five days make one *hou*,
five *hou* make twenty-five—
thus the father’s age is twenty-five.
The child’s number is unfixed,
its age conveyed and revolving without constancy—
hence the father is young, the child is old.

The world does not know that the myriad things
arise and are completed from the Five Phases as parents.

**Employing Fire**
The formula states: The six lines of the straight tally,
revolving hexagrams to employ fire—
weights and measures begin with *Pure Kun*,
end with *Kun*,
cycling without cease.

The formula states: One cauldron is changed each month,
thus nine cauldrons are used before stopping.
The tenth cauldron is left to natural ebb and flow—
whether used or not, both yield wondrous transformation,
for this is the original qi of metal’s birth.

Thus, the earthen crucible—
the earthen crucible is called the mother,
the mother of the metal cauldron.

The formula states: The metal cauldron follows the revolving qi and seasons—
after fifteen days, the metal nature perishes;
after thirty days, the elixir forms.
When the cycle reaches the tenth month,
the original earth is no longer used as the cauldron—
mother and child shed their forms,
nine transformations, nine cauldrons.
Nine is the fire in service;
the cauldron is the mother in service.

All elixirs resemble humans—
from receiving qi to birth, three hundred seventy days,
nine months when yin and yang are both abundant,
the tenth month when earth is sovereign—
thus mother and child part,
hence the name *shedding the womb*.

The returning elixir resembles a person—
four qi complete, it is born,
like an infant nourished for three years,
until the great original qi is full,
and the golden elixir is achieved.
This is called *Yellow Fame*,
transforming and returning to the north,
black color penetrating through—
only then is it named *Great Return*.
The world does not know this.

The child is the medicine,
the mother is the cauldron—
responding to qi, they generate one another,
produce and subdue,
restrain and overcome,
alternately flourishing and declining.
Ascending and descending within the cauldron,
flying and hiding above and below,
yin and yang govern each other,
intermingling and devouring,
the four agents pressing upon one another,
ruler and minister attending.

Earth’s nature gives birth,
metal’s nature dies,
fire’s nature extinguishes,
water’s nature unites.
The four agents—
yin within yang, yang within yin.

But with the original earth as the axle,
the straight tally revolves—
thus the four agents,
each dwelling in its quadrant.
When the natures of the four agents all perish,
returning to unity and the root—
this is called the golden elixir.

The formula states: Guard and revolve for one year,
ingest one *liang* and a half—
no illness will assail you.

After two years, the White Way is achieved—ingest half a *liang*.
After three years, the Great Original *qi* is full and the Red Way is achieved—ingest one *fen* to dwell in the world while death’s register omits your name.
A *daogui* measure refines mercury into the White Way; after five years, ingest seven grains the size of sesame seeds. With a *daogui* measure, transmute one *jin* each of iron and mercury into the Red Way. After nine years of guarding and revolving, ingest three grains—the Three Corpses and Nine Worms will all depart, and you will attain longevity without death.
You will be able to transform the Five Metals and Eight Stones, turning even tiles and pebbles into treasures according to their original colors.

The fire method states: The established symbolic trigrams, hand-mirror fire records of weights, and reliance on yin and yang conceal the mechanism of hidden transformations. Though the descendants’ methods differ slightly, the essential technique remains the same.
For example, in the eleventh month, when *jianzi* begins, the first yang line stirs the fire. The generating number is two, the completing number seven—movement and bearing proceed like a wheel.
In the first month, one yang arises; by the fifth month, one yin arises. Each month, one yang line retreats until the tenth month, when all returns to earth, ending in *kun*—then the cycle begins anew.
The Golden Elixir is the movement of the sun and moon, naturally forming the elixir.
Since Suiren altered fire, later sages have used it, aligning with celestial fire. The utmost of creation lies herein—timekeeping is precise, seasonal fire adjustments and weight movements proceed gradually, like steaming. When the four seasons, months, and hours are fulfilled, the Golden Elixir is complete, for the fire-timing dictates it.
If driven too hastily, it flees like a chicken; if too lenient, it will not submit. But by following the straight tally’s trigrams, gold and water will naturally obey.

In the sixth month, yang ends at *si*; in the twelfth month, yin ends at *chou*.
The formula states: Cinnabar is the essence of flowing yang pearls, establishing *qian* and *kun*, moving water and fire, responding to celestial tally, and harmonizing the Three Powers.
Gold is the essence of the moon, dwelling in the yin position. Mercury contains the *qi* of *li*, corresponding to the yang line.
The numinous embryo of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon—when the negative reaches its extreme, the positive arises. Thus it is said: Cinnabar is the essence of wood, which merges with metal—this is the Way of the Three-in-One.
The Three are fire; the One is the medicine—hence the name "guarding the One."
It is also said: Cinnabar is the medicine; gold is the cauldron. Thus, the Three Ways derive from the One, all rooted in the fundamental.
The supreme principle of the Great Way admits no second gate.
Cinnabar’s nature is mild and non-toxic, its flavor pungent. The original *qi* communicates with the numinous, and all things do not wither—it is called Black Lead.
Black Lead is the natural liquid within cinnabar, the liquid drawn out by the upturned moon.
Thus it is said: Black Lead enters the upturned moon, pairing as husband and wife. Yin soul unites with yang spirit, and the two natures naturally harmonize.

The formula states: Employ the Five Agents—*qian*, *kun*, *zhen*, and *xun*—the straight tally nurtures from the inception of *jian*, when the first yang arises. *Zi* and *wu* correspond, eight eights interconnect, shifting with the hours. The sun, moon, and five planets, the coming and going of cold and heat, day as yang and night as yin—every forty-five days, a new phase arrives. Yin and yang adjust and submit, moving and returning, circulating through the sixty-four hexagrams in endless cycles. Water and fire follow one another, dwelling without external things—the Five Metals and Eight Stones are subject to human transformation.
The Five Metals are the Five Agents; the Eight Stones are the Eight Trigrams.

The formula states: Water meets the dragon and becomes rain; fire meets man and moves yin and yang. *Qi* governs the growth of all things; the dragon’s movement and rain’s descent bring all things to life.
The Reverted Elixir nurtures creation, not exceeding the Five Agents.
The formula states: When the straight tally first stirs, water is pure and timing is not lost. The civil fire does not exceed nine; the martial fire does not exceed nine.
Nine is the extreme of yang. Three threes make nine—the utmost of *daguo*, the inception of yin’s birth. When yin is exhausted, yang arises—all follows the Dao of heaven, with yin and yang in motion.
If gold and water are balanced, the seasonal nodes are followed. If the sequence is lost, gold and water perish.
Movement is like a silkworm warming and hatching eggs, receiving *qi* to generate life. The workings of mutual generation and destruction resemble the transformation of a cold valley into spring—yin and yang, the Five Agents, mutually employ one another, all established through analogy.

The formula states: Essence is original *qi*. It is born in the southern fire of *bing* and *ding*—*li*, lodged in the two yang lines with one yin arising, the sun’s soul, yin mercury, water.
When its *qi* is full, it shifts to the northern water of *ren* and *gui*—*kan*, lodged in the two yin lines with one yang arising, the moon’s spirit, yang mercury, metal.
Water is still and unmoving, the body of non-action. Fire is blazing and ceaseless, the ancestor of action. Bringing the active under the control of the inactive completes the wondrous Way.
Thus, know that metal is born in dark yin places—this is the inception, the correspondence of *zi* and *wu*.

The formula states: When gold enters the Central Palace, it is the Great One’s *geng* city. It nurtures the yellow *qi*, blending its original essence.
The Red Horse guards the Yellow Crow; the Azure Dragon rides the White Tiger. Control and submission follow their kind—hence the name *Cantong*.
It is also said: *Kan* and *li* are one and two—south and north alone form the path.
One is water; two is fire. All things are born through water and completed through fire. Fire and metal contend; water and earth overcome—thus the Great Elixir is achieved.
The straight tally first stirs in *zi*, the eleventh month, arising from *zhen*. In the fourth month, fire reigns, extreme yang retreats. Then it arises from *xun*—the two woods gradually submit.
Though mercury is initially subdued in *qian*, it is not yet the Fire Elixir. After guarding and revolving for three phases, it is called Cinnabar Sand; after five phases, Gold Sand. After one year, it is called Long Sand or the Lesser Reverted Elixir; after two years, the Soul-Returning Elixir or the Middle Reverted Elixir.
After one thousand days, when the *qi* is full, it is called the *Qi* Beast Great Reverted Golden Liquid Elixir—ingesting it grants immortality.

The formula states: Those who cultivate the Golden Elixir without awakening to the mysterious principle fail because they do not comprehend that cinnabar is the root of lead’s transformation. Lost in confusion, they mistakenly use common mercury, common lead, gold, silver, realgar, and azurite.

The common lead is the mother of worldly silver; realgar is the child of the medicine; cinnabar is the mother of lead; yellow is earth, and earth is the parent of cinnabar. Azurite belongs to *jia*, the parent of fire; azurite belongs to wood, stationed in the east. The unenlightened mistakenly use mercury, common lead, gold, silver, realgar, and azurite as medicines, or as crucibles and vessels, or as mother and child, or refine lead to extract its flower, or mix stones into the medicine—from ancient times to the present, none have succeeded.

The root of the Dao, the path of immortality, lies in unity before one’s eyes. Cinnabar, the essence of wood, is born from earth and dies in earth; its arising and ceasing do not depart from the Five Phases. They alternately serve as parents, mutually overcoming and generating to form substance.

The formula states: *Qi* sustains life—this is the Inner Elixir. Medicine preserves form—this is the Outer Elixir. For attaining long life through ingestion, nothing surpasses the Inner and Outer Elixirs, the radiant *qi* of the sun and moon. This radiant *qi* is the primordial harmonious *qi* of cinnabar, the very foundation of nature and life. Beyond the essence of the Inner and Outer Elixirs, the five metals, two azurites, four yellows, miscellaneous stones, magnetite, and five alums are not within the scope of discussion.

The formula states: Consider mercury—solitary yin, widowed yang—it corrodes bones and searches marrow. Gold damages the liver; silver damages the spleen; copper damages the kidneys; lead and tin damage the stomach. The four yellows are highly toxic, all possessing material nature, severing yang and harming the primordial harmonious *qi*. To speak of a single metal or stone is not to speak of common metals or stones. The six waters of the world are all highly toxic; though no immediate harm may appear upon ingestion, they ultimately cause great injury. Cinnabar, if governed by minor auxiliary methods, can treat worldly illnesses and slightly prolong life, but it cannot grant immortality.

The method states: Using the four ingredients—prepared sulphur, realgar, and azurite—to make vessels, when they mutually subdue one another, success is achieved. If various toxic medicines are suppressed and forced together, the resulting conglomeration of *qi* is impure and cannot be ingested. Exercise caution.

The formula states: Common lead is the mother of worldly silver; within the ore, it receives sufficient yang *qi* and naturally subdues fire. When smelted, it becomes worldly silver.

The formula states: Mercury and the mercury within cinnabar may appear similar in form, yet they differ as distinctly as man and woman. Cinnabar resembles man, the essence and spirit of the Great Yang sun, capable of preserving human nature and life. It inherently contains mercury to subdue and restrain itself, neither mingling with external mercury nor being forced by external substances—thus it benefits human nature and life. Common mercury resembles woman, the essence and soul of the Great Yin moon, capable of seizing human nature and life. Solitary yin, widowed yang, it is highly toxic and cannot be ingested.

The formula states: Though the yin and yang natures of mercury differ, they are both the essence of heaven and earth, resembling the distinction between male and female yin and yang. When cinnabar is governed by minor auxiliary methods, common lead may be used as a vessel to frame and complete the medicine.

The formula states: The unenlightened do not know the root of the Yellow and White; they mistakenly use common mercury, common lead, gold, and silver as supreme medicines. Little do they realize that mercury is born from lead, and cinnabar is produced from gold. In the Golden Elixir, one must know that lead is the foundation of *qi* and its transformation—how can one abandon the root and rely on external things? Lead is the child, the essence of cinnabar; *qi* is the mother, the earth that generates essence—hence it is called the root lead *qi*.

The formula states: Celestial lead is vermilion lead. Gold is born from lead, meaning the child is concealed within the mother’s womb. The child is also hidden within gold, meaning the mother is concealed within the child’s womb. Lead is the Yellow Sprout; yellow is earth; sprout is cinnabar. Earth can generate sprouts, hence it is called the Yellow Sprout. Lead and mercury are the fine matchmakers of the Seven Treasures and the marrow of the Five Metals. When understood, all matters become clear; when deluded, all paths are blocked. Thus, lead restrains mercury, and lead and mercury mutually complete one another to form the Way of the Yellow and White.

The formula states: The Dao consists of one yin and one yang; the Elixir consists of one metal and one stone. Stone rides the yang and is hot; metal receives the yin and is cold. This is the mutual resonance of spirit and soul, an inevitable principle. Stone liquid stabilizes the spirit; metal essence stabilizes the soul. Without the interaction of yin and yang, how could one await the depths of the Nine Darks?

Thus it is said: The gentleman seeks a fine companion, as the virtuous maiden is his perfect match. The Old Woman of the River is numinous and most divine. When she meets fire, she flies, leaving no trace of dust. Ghosts hide and dragons conceal themselves—none know where they reside. To subdue her, the Yellow Sprout is the root. If one does not enter the Yellow Sprout and burns mercury alone, even with a vessel a foot thick and sealed a hundredfold, when fire is applied, it will fly away, leaving nothing behind in an instant, like a ghost vanishing into darkness or a dragon hiding in the watery abyss. Even with the eyes of Li Lou, one could not perceive its trace. That water cannot flow east or west is the power of the Yellow Sprout.

The formula of the Primordial Lord states: The Yellow Sprout is the *jia-zi* of the Five Phases. *Jia* belongs to wood, the parent of yang. The mother belongs to the *qi* of earth. After the winter solstice, one yang surges forth—this is called the birth of one yang. The sprout receives *qi* from the mother earth and is named *jia*. *Jia* relies on earth to sprout; the sprout depends on the mother. The mother is *kun*, which is the Yellow Sprout of *gui*. The position of the Six *Jia* is imprisoned, dead, resting, or abandoned—all share one *jia*, which is extinguished in *gui*. The Five Grains, Five Vegetables, flourishing grasses and trees, the myriad creatures born from wombs and eggs, medicinal substances, and people—all arise from the Yellow Sprout. The yang *qi* is warm and diffuse, moving the earth to act, breathing as a fetus breathes. All things in spring and summer disperse and grow as the Yellow Sprout; in autumn and winter, they contract and mature, each returning to its color and original flavor, unchanged in form—hence the meaning of Reverted Elixir is to return to the root. If a person alters their constant nature, they must die; if a thing changes its color, it must decay.

Thus we know that medicinal substances move directly, the yang *qi* bears and transports, yet they do not alter their original form—aligned with the celestial fire in creation. The Reverted Elixir receives *qi* and returns to the root. The yang *qi* shines and congeals by the natural Dao, hence called the Yellow Sprout. People of the world do not know that when the Three Luminaries of heaven and earth first divided into clear and turbid, all people and the myriad things arose from the Yellow Sprout, born without transcending the Five Phases. The Yellow Sprout is the first budding, stretching, and bending of the initial sprout. It coalesces through yang and is born through yin, where yin and yang intersect. At the moment of receiving *qi*, it is initially a primordial chaos. After the separation of clear and turbid, the Yellow Sprout first emerges. In *jia*, it is called "yellow"; in the crescent, it is called "sprout"; in extension, it is called "bud"—hence the name Yellow Sprout. Thus we know the primordial does not depart from the Five Phases: the Five Phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Water is said to moisten and descend; fire, to flame and ascend; metal, to follow and transform; wood, to bend and straighten; earth, to sow and reap.

The formula states: The great Dao of heaven and earth endures forever; the *qi* of primordial harmony grants long life, yet none surpass the sun, moon, and stars. Yin and yang, the Five Phases, all depend on earth to be born and ultimately return to earth. They follow the four seasons in cyclic transformation—this too is the natural Dao. For instance, animal fat, receiving the *qi* of the great yang for a thousand years, transforms into *fushen*. After another thousand years, it becomes amber; after yet another thousand, it becomes crystal. All are the essence of the sun and moon’s radiant *qi*, congealed into essence by illumination. Another example: toads and frogs playing in the moonlight, clams and oysters bearing pearls—all gather and receive the *qi* of the great yin’s lunar radiance, forming pearls in the womb. These pearls are the congealed yin essence of the moon. Both substances are fit for ingestion, particularly effective for lung *qi*, fright and evil, and forgetfulness. Form them into pills with wood honey, the size of sesame seeds, and take three after meals with saliva—pearls from clams can restrain mercury.

When a person cultivates inner virtue and power, the *qi* of primordial harmony surges and harmonizes. Through cultivation and embracing the Dao, essence congeals into a pearl, naturally granting long life. The pearl resides in the red waters—red waters are blood. Consider birds, beasts, insects, ants, fish, and crabs: all that dwell and endure receive the *qi* of primordial harmony, sustaining life without reliance on parental instruction. How could they attain enlightenment? By steadfast resolve, harmonious resonance in sound, mutual resonance among things, interpenetration of being and non-being, yin and yang embracing to fulfill the great Dao—when the two *qi* harmonize, being and non-being distinguish yet complete each other, realizing the true Dao.

The River Chariot is the master of the Five Metals, also the northern position. Water can ferry the chariot, bearing the myriad things; its wheels turn without cease. This is yang dwelling in the yin position, yin uniting with yang essence—when metal and mercury meet, it is called the River Chariot. The Dao of primordial harmony is the ancestor, establishing heaven and earth, regulating yin and yang. The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born. Receiving *qi* is called destiny; the most numinous is humanity. No blessing surpasses life, no misfortune surpasses death. Yet hating death while desiring life is to lose the Dao and fail to attain life. Strive, strive!

Moreover, what I have annotated differs from other schools, its meaning aligning with the orthodox classics, its principle resonating with the great Dao. In discussing hexagrams and images, fire timing comes first; in selecting yin and yang, medicinal substances are primary. *Can* means to blend. Water, earth, and metal—three substances—form one family, like tallying tokens or contracts, uniting in a single principle, hence called *Cantong* (Triple Unity).

The formula states: The myriad things are not born without the sun and moon; metal and water are not perfected without fire and earth. Metal and water are the origin of transformation; fire and earth are the beginning of yin and yang. When heaven and earth were in primordial chaos, they were silent, though not yet transformed, they were ultimately the root of the myriad things. Metal is white, water is black; they meet within *qi*, resembling a chicken’s egg. The yang burning-mirror gathers fire, yet without the sun, it does not emit light. The Dog Rong use a fire-mirror to hold mugwort, transforming it in an instant—thus fire emerges, resembling the Reverted Elixir, the union of yin-yang metal and fire. Such things also exist within the Great Tang’s domain, but "words cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning." Yet can the intent of the sages not be glimpsed?

Those who use common mercury to make the Golden Elixir are deluded. Those who speak of cinnabar without grasping its principle do not know the Dao—they have strayed far from the truth. Some say: Using common mercury and common lead yields no numinosity, for they fail to comprehend the true essence of mercury and true lead, only praising the efficacy of common lead. They do not speak of mercury’s subtlety and wonder, insisting on singular success without acknowledging dual excellence. If common lead is used as medicine, it strays far from the Dao. If common mercury is used for the Golden Elixir, it is not the true method. Those who grasp it rightly take mercury and fire-lead as primary. As long as lead retains its original *qi*, encountering the Five Phases, it forms the Elixir without losing its root. If one comprehends primordial transformation, a single application yields boundless marvels. If one clings to external things as emotion, nature cannot unite. If mercury is substituted for cinnabar, lead cannot be embraced. If nature cannot unite the Three Palaces, how can it be secured? If lead cannot embrace the Eight Stones, how can it be wondrous?

Gold retains its original weight; gold does not lose its heaviness. The sun and moon retain their usual forms. Yin mercury does not lose its weight—this is the sun and moon’s gold, retaining its original heaviness. My destiny lies in lead; lead does not lose heaven. When lead completes the Reverted Elixir, gold endures for ten thousand myriad years. Lead is the two mercuries, originally one body without duality—hence called celestial lead. Do not harm my lead, that my destiny may be preserved. Do not break my chariot, that I may return home. Lead is that which naturally arises within cinnabar; the chariot is the liquid drawn from cinnabar. Within lead is gold; within gold is return. Discerning treasure from treasure, the worthy attain the Dao. Lead is that which naturally arises within cinnabar; gold, through fire’s movement, returns with the moon.

The Perfected One speaks: the golden essence and yellow sprouts possess the power to restrain water from overflowing—this is the Dark Water. The golden essence and yellow sprouts share a name, being the self-generated lead. Water is the liquid drawn from cinnabar. To use lead or not to use lead—without it, one cannot attain longevity. Using lead means the cinnabar naturally contains lead to restrain it. Not using lead refers to the mother of common silver, which is ordinary lead. If lead is not true, the supreme Dao is hard to attain. If lead is true, one does not lose one’s household retainer. If lead is not true, it is ordinary lead. If lead is true, it is cinnabar-lead. Better to refine the gold within lead—this is the gold self-generated within cinnabar. Do not refine the treasure within gold—this is common mercury. The sage clearly sets forth analogies to instruct later learners.

What is the crucible? It is the native soil where raw cinnabar is born. What is the medicine? It is the mercury that naturally flows from cinnabar. Fire-lead is the mercury produced when cinnabar is moved by the sun and moon. Water-silver is another name for mercury, drawn from cinnabar when its yang qi is insufficient. When mercury resides within cinnabar, its essence incomplete, it is called the maiden. When fire-lead resides within cinnabar, its essence complete and self-generated, it is called the youth. Male and female unite, yin and yang naturally harmonize, their union free from any foreign element. The Golden Elixir originates from a single substance, with nothing external added; through the movement of yang qi, it is called the Dao of the Three-in-One. The white is the essence of metal, the black the essence of water—they return to oneness without duality. The sage borrows the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* as metaphors, moving and refining the elixir through reversal of time. When the hun and po are lost, like the sun and moon eclipsing and losing their positions, they do not submit to one another. The sage guards this secret, unwilling to speak plainly, often using veiled language. From this, scriptural instructions diverge, and many fail to succeed. Some, despising the loss, incur great resentment.

The method of the golden crucible must be guarded with care. When medicines are combined, achieving efficacy is difficult. The heavenly Dao is secretly revealed, sometimes hidden in celestial images, sometimes attached to yin and yang, falsely expounded among men. Its words are subtle, its principles profound, yet some remain deluded and uncomprehending. Since the time of Fuxi, those who sought the Dao and long life have been many, but those who encountered and attained it have been few. Relying on their own conjectures without discernment, and without seeking a teacher’s instruction, they compose their own formulas, seeking the way to transcend the world. In vain, they toil in famous mountains and deep valleys, decaying like foolish scholars. Those who seek immortality never attain it. Eating the five grains, indulging the six desires, man dwells in yang, ghosts in yin. Unable to command ghosts and spirits or direct yin and yang, they fail to obtain the elixir of transcendence and all perish in the world. Like seeking warmth by grasping silk in the cold or drinking water to ride the wind in the heat, born within the bounds of yin and yang, governed by the five phases, consuming earthly things, they return to earth at death, repaying the earth with their bodies to revert to their origin.

Without encountering the radiant qi of the sun and moon, circulating their essence and fluids, and refining the Reverted Elixir of the Three-in-One, how can one transcend the world? They crowd together like walking corpses, like stones cast into rivers, gone without return, sinking into servitude and transformation—truly pitiable. But if one encounters the inner and outer Golden Elixir and consumes it, the body is transformed and appearance preserved in an extraordinary manner. One can escape the bounds of yin and yang, free from the five phases’ control, unrecorded in the registers of death, with ghosts and spirits as attendants.

The scripture states: Daoist books and immortal transmissions, secret records of elixir classics—*The Dragon and Tiger*, *The Supreme Clarity Scripture*, the five works akin to the *Zhouyi* hexagrams, the songs and verses of the *Cantong Qi*—all expound the sages’ intent. The Yellow Emperor, Laozi, Confucius, and the twenty-four Perfected Immortals were all immortals who attained the Dao. Worldly people, deluded and uncomprehending, must cultivate practice to achieve it. There are also unnamed individuals who attained it and concealed it. Those who deny the existence of the immortal Dao are truly foolish and deluded. All the songs, records, scriptural instructions, and hexagrams reveal only branches and leaves, not the direct path. From ancient times to the present, one must receive oral instructions from a teacher to succeed; without the proper destiny, one cannot learn it. Those who transmit this method must treasure and guard it, for the heavenly Dao must not be lightly revealed. Nurturing a tiger invites it to bite you; entrusting it to the unworthy brings calamity for seven generations, demoting one to a lowly ghost, eternally serving the ghost officials—how can one not fear this?

Even when one finds a worthy person, one must still examine their conduct. Only those of unwavering inner practice and destined signs may receive the transmission. One must first purify one’s intent, invoke the hundred spirits, swear oaths, and establish a covenant before passing it on—this must be done with utmost care. Cultivation must be unwavering, the supreme medicine peerless. When human Dao aligns with the primordial principle, it can naturally be encountered. One must endure hardship and toil without complaint, not seeking it hastily or recklessly. Upon meeting an enlightened teacher, one awakens to the great medicine through a single word—there is only one gate. The three substances—water, earth, and metal—are not the common water, earth, and metal of the world. Attaining them, the hun and po return, and one achieves long life without death. With a mind of unwavering practice, the teacher will surely come.

The Golden Elixir and Inner Elixir, once their gate is attained and consumed, confer immortality, equaling heaven and earth in duration. The secret method of long life, called the *Elbow-Behind Method*, is revealed to later learners who fail to comprehend. The construction of the crucible, the addition of metal, the use of the direct tally, and the hexagram timing of the clepsydra are not recorded here—those who understand should examine and consider them carefully.

**Method for Unchanging-Colored Sulfur:**
Take a duck egg, remove the yolk and white, and wipe the inside clean with paper. The opening should be small. Once dry, take fine yellow sulfur, grind it, and mix it with egg white until slightly moist. Fill the egg with this mixture, packing it tightly with a chopstick. Seal the opening with egg white mixed with lead powder to ensure it is airtight.

Then mix red lead with egg white to form a paste, and coat the entire duck egg with it to a thickness of approximately two *fen*. Once dry, apply yellow clay to a thickness of two *fen* and let it dry in the sun. Next, wrap it finely with lead, layering it to a thickness of four or five *fen*, repeating this process three times. Stand the egg upright in an iron mortar, then pour molten lead over it until half-submerged. When cool, pour more molten lead to cover the top, leaving a thickness of five or six *cun* above. Around the mortar, construct a mud fire furnace as usual, placing fire at three points to keep the mortar slightly warm, ensuring the lead does not melt completely. On the fourteenth day, apply intense heat to melt the lead, and once melted, skim off the floating dross and collect it. When cool, open the egg to find the sulfur subdued by fire, its color unchanged. This can be used to prepare a vessel for subduing cinnabar and mercury. One *liang* of subdued sulfur can subdue half a *liang* of raw sulfur in five days, which is also sufficient for the fire-subduing process.

**Wood-Elixir Formula:**
Take one *hu* of wood, wash it clean with water, dry it, and pound it finely into powder. Boil it in two *hu* of clear water until soft, then strain the liquid through silk. Steam the liquid in a copper vessel over boiling water. Add one *sheng* of white honey and one *sheng* of pitted, mashed dates, blending the pulp and skin thoroughly. Mix this into the wood liquid, stirring until it reaches a jerky-like consistency. Take daily a piece the size of a bullet, three or four pieces, and all illnesses will be cured, no evil will harm you, your complexion will glow, your ears and eyes will sharpen, and after three years, your face will resemble that of a maiden. You will become an immortal and never die.

**Another Formula:**
Take one *hu* of wood, wash it clean, dry it, and pound it into powder. Remove the pits from four *dou* of large dates, mix with five *dou* of wine, and simmer slowly while stirring until it forms a thick syrup. Take daily three pills the size of a plum, and no illness will harm you. Your face will become like that of a child, and you will withstand cold and frost.

The *Secret of Penetrating the Profound* concludes here.
