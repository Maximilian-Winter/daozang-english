# 太清经天师口诀

**Oral Instructions of the Celestial Master from the *Taiqing Jing***

The *Taiqing Jing* of the Celestial Master comprises oral instructions. Its compiler remains unknown, though it likely emerged during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The first half, titled *Oral Instructions of the Celestial Master*, pertains to the water-based methods of elixir refinement. The latter half, *Red Pine Master’s Elbow-Pouch Medicinal Instructions*, records the preparation of ten ointments, powders, and nine medicinal formulas.

The term "oral instructions" denotes the supreme key among the myriad scriptures of immortality. Those who seek transcendence through countless arts yet fail to obtain these instructions shall never succeed. Their secrecy is paramount—worth more than ten thousand gold pieces. If transmitted at all, they must be imparted orally, following the text line by line, never committed to writing in full.

According to the ritual code, the recipient must present as a pledge: eight taels of gold, forty feet of yellow cloth, eight taels of silver, and forty feet of white silk. Within a century, the instructions may be passed to but one person, sealed by an oath of cinnabar, never to be disclosed. Should one violate the code, transmit them to the unworthy, or breach confidentiality, the Heavenly Emperor shall expel them from the ranks of immortals, forever barring their ascent to the Mystic Path of the Supreme Mystery and the Celestial Capital. Their mind shall grow confused, their ambitions collapse. The Nine Elder Immortals shall cloud their spirit, rendering all their studies futile. The Supreme Unity’s Record-Keeper shall omit their name from the Register of Life, and the Three Heavens’ Life-Commanders shall curtail their years. Calamity shall extend to their seven generations, and they shall suffer punishment in the Great Mystery Capital.

The oral instructions for the *Taiqing Divine Elixir* specify the preparation of the "Flowery Pond" (*huachi*). As the text directs, take five *sheng* of grain, soak it in water until sprouts emerge, then dry and grind it into powder. Place this in the Flowery Pond, mix with the other ingredients, and the process shall succeed. Without sprouted grain, the Flowery Pond cannot form—this is the essential principle of the Great Dao.

With water, gold, jade, the Five Minerals, gold, silver, pearls, and lead, all may be transmuted into liquid. The method is detailed in the *Thirty-Six Water Scriptures*, and all require the Flowery Pond to achieve completion.

**Method for Dissolving True Pearls into Water:**
Sift large pearls finely. For every *jin*, add two *liang* of saltpeter powder, place in a black-feathered vessel, and seal both ends with carved wooden stoppers, then coat with lacquer or beeswax. Alternatively, seal the mouth with wax and submerge it in the Flowery Pond or strong, bitter wine. Seal the jar’s opening and inspect it frequently after seven days, taking care never to open the vessel’s mouth. Hold it to the light to observe whether dissolution has occurred. When the pearls turn to water, they will resemble mercury within the vessel. Ingest a dose the size of a *wutong* seed each morning. After a hundred days, one shall attain immortality. If the pearls have not dissolved, return them to strong vinegar until fully liquefied. Small, miscellaneous pearls may also be refined by this method. Pour the dissolved pearl liquid into molds to form large pearls. Alternatively, take bright, pure white mother-of-pearl from oysters or clams, break it, and select the finest portions. For every *jin*, add two *liang* of saltpeter, grind finely, place in a black-feathered vessel, and dissolve as above. Pour into pearl molds to congeal into true pearls, shaping them as desired for other objects.

**Method for Dissolving Lead and Tin into Mercury:**
Take half a *jin* each of lead and tin, melt them together, and hammer into thin sheets resembling chive leaves. Take a fresh bamboo tube, pare its outer layer until as thin as silk, insert the lead-tin sheets, and add two *liang* of saltpeter. Seal the top and bottom tightly, ensuring the bamboo joints are secure, then coat the opening with lacquer to prevent gas leakage. Soak the tube in aged, strong vinegar within a jar, seal the jar’s mouth with wax, and leave undisturbed for forty-five days. The metals shall transform into mercury, suitable for filling gold but not for elixir use.

**Silver Snow Method:**
The original text states: Take one *jin* of mercury and fifteen *liang* of *huashi* (talc or mica), and refine them together until thoroughly blended. Boil the mercury in strong vinegar for nine days and nights, replenishing the vinegar as it depletes until the mercury solidifies. Then grind it into powder and mix with *huashi*. When compounding various elixirs, blending medicines, or using mercury in any alchemical process, failure to follow this method will prevent the mercury from harmonizing, and the work shall never succeed.

It further states: Place the mixture in a vessel coated with Six-One, lead white, and a red crucible. "Six-One" refers to Six-One Mud, prepared according to the method in the *Nine Elixirs Scripture*. "Lead white" is the lead white described in the original text, mixed with strong vinegar and pounded a thousand times. Apply this to the inner surface of an earthen crucible to a thickness of three *fen*, then dry in the shade for ten days before adding the mercury and *huashi* powder. The "red crucible" is an earthen crucible. To make it, take red-yellow soil from a chicken coop, grind it finely, sift through silk, and steam from dawn until noon. Remove, mix with thin vinegar to form a paste, and pound until smooth. Shape the crucible according to the quantity of ingredients, ensuring a uniform thickness of about five *fen*, then dry in the shade for thirty days. Next, take thirty *jin* of *hu* tree bark, chop finely, and boil in three *dan* of water for a day. Strain and reduce the liquid to about one *dou*, yielding a deep red-black substance called *hu* lacquer. Coat the exterior of the earthen crucible with this lacquer to harden it, preventing cracks in fire. This is the great secret of the divine elixir crucible.

For the *Taiqing* Nine Elixirs, Golden Liquor, Eight Radiant Essences, Flower of the Supreme Void’s Jade Rosary, Returning Elixir, Flying Lightness, Mystic Frost, Crimson Snow, Supreme Harmony, Spontaneous, Vermilion Radiance, Cloud Azure, Purple Flower, Crimson Blossoms, and all other grand elixirs, the earthen crucibles used must follow these instructions. Without them, the crucibles shall crack in the fire, and the work shall fail.

It further states: Cover the crucible with a red basin and seal it with Six-One. The alchemist must mix lead red with strong vinegar to form a paste, pound it a thousand times, and apply it to the crucible’s mouth. Then cover it with a red basin.

Apply lead red paste again, sealing the juncture tightly, and dry it in the shade for ten days. Then coat the exterior of the earthen crucible and its lid with Six-One paste, ensuring a uniform thickness of five *fen*, and dry it in the shade for another ten days. Next, mix white clay with fermented mash and the basin’s residue, pound it a thousand times, and apply it over the Six-One paste, then dry it in the shade for ten more days.

Thereafter, erect four weights at the four cardinal directions and one depression at the center, calling this the "Five Peaks." Alternatively, arrange three supports in a triangle, naming them the "Three Terraces," and place the earthen crucible upon them. Fire it according to the prescribed method.

*Gen* Snow is also called White Snow or *Xiong* Snow. The method states: Use Six-One paste to build a structure in a large cauldron, stacking it like a *sheng* measure, and dry it in the shade. Place *Gen* Snow beneath it and cover it with a copper plate. Sprinkle a small amount of strong vinegar inside, then heat it with charcoal fire until both the *Gen* Snow and the copper plate dissolve. Refin it into a plate, suspend it above the Flower Pond, with the rest as described in the classic instructions. For *Xiong* Snow, place it inside the flying vessel, seal it with a red basin, and fire it following the *Gen* Snow method. The flying vessel is a red earthen crucible.

*Chisongzi’s Elbow-Behind Remedy Formula*
Yunzi respectfully asks Chisongzi: "Humans receive the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth to be born and rely on the Four Great Powers to be nourished. Yet why do they differ in wisdom and folly, and why are their lifespans unequal?"

Chisongzi replies: "Your question is indeed profound."

Now I shall explain to you the causes of encountering such truths—only the worthy may inquire of me. I have lived through the Three Calamities of Heaven and Earth before comprehending the efficacy of the supreme elixirs, whose value far surpasses ten thousand gold pieces and cannot be fully described. The power of the great elixirs can kill a person, revive a person, emaciate a person, or fatten a person. They transform the countenance, alter the appearance, enhance one’s nature, and extend one’s years. They can prolong life beyond kalpas, allowing one to witness the attainment of immortality and sagehood. Do you believe this?

Yunzi replies: "My body has not yet received the scriptures, so I dare not firmly believe."

Chisongzi says: "Your heart doubts. Would you also disbelieve that water can extinguish fire? It is ignorance. Strike a flint, and clouds instantly rise; scatter *Hong* stone, and heaven sends rain and dew. Drop the *Luo* pellet, and both sun and moon are eclipsed; scatter goose ash, and wind arises. *Shi* rice can suppress wind and quell fire, while *Haiban* skin can instantly summon thunder, lightning, and radiance. Reed ash in a tube causes the sun and moon to halo; *Jieqian* and *Lusu* make the earth quake. Cast the *Huijing* sand pellet, and mountains topple; apply the *Shenqian* grinding powder, and the seas dry up. Mix powdered glass with fish gall and *Ao* bile, and dragons come; shoot the beast pellet, and tigers and leopards flee. The Five Ointments can confer instant transcendence, and the Three Powders can deliver one from calamities across billions of kalpas, allowing one to witness the attainment of sagehood. The *Tai* True Pellet grants a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. These medicines have been long verified by the immortals—do you believe?"

Yunzi says: "Having received your teachings and enlightening guidance, my heart now believes. I humbly request to hear the names of these medicines."

Chisongzi says: "Listen carefully. Today I shall transmit to you the complete account of medicines and their formulations as taught by Hu Gangzi. Chisongzi addresses Yunzi: These Five Ointments and Three Powders were originally bestowed by the Heavenly Immortal Qian Yuanzi upon Hu Chongzi, who then passed them to Zhen Huazi. I received them from Zhen Huazi after enduring two cycles of the Three Calamities. If you possess lofty aspirations and seek to study longevity and immortality, I shall now transmit them to you. After receiving these medicines, if you encounter a benevolent and compassionate seeker of transcendence, observe their conduct over time—those of steadfast character, sincere heart, and filial piety—you may then confer upon them the method of the Five Ointments and Three Powders.

**Method of the Disaster-Averting Numinous Flying Powder, First Scroll**
In the primordial era of the Three Origins, there was a certain Tai Anzi, a record-keeper of the immortal officials. While overseeing immortal formulas, he often heard the immortal officials praise the Five Ointments and Three Powders, with the Golden Elixir being the most supreme. He copied the formula and transmitted it to Qian Yuanzi. Qian Yuanzi, whose name was Lizhen, passed it down to ten great immortals. Upon first ingesting this medicine, after twenty days, one’s spirit becomes keen, strength increases ten-thousandfold, and the complexion turns jadelike. One may ascend and dwell at will, command ghosts and spirits, and having attained the Dao of immortality, ranks among the upper echelon of transcendents.

The method requires thirty-six taels of newly smelted *Li* gold, refined, and seven taels of stalactite powder. Hammer the gold into thin sheets. Divide the thirty-six taels of gold into six portions, each of six taels. Take one portion of six taels of gold, cut it finely, place it in a jade mortar, and grind it five hundred times with a jade pestle. Add five fen of stalactite powder and grind them together into a fine powder. If one desires pure gold powder, wash it with water to remove the sand, and the stalactite powder will separate. If unable to wash away the sand, ingesting the mixture with the stalactite is also excellent. The reason for mixing stalactite powder is that gold is inherently slippery; grinding it alone will not produce powder. With stalactite powder, it readily forms. Thus it is said: *Gold powder mixed with half stalactite, ground gently, naturally softens.* It is also said: *To neutralize gold’s toxicity, use unburnt wood, cow dung, and magnetite, blended together. Guard this secret, and it will lead you into the immortal’s abode.*

**Method of Ingesting the Numinous Flying Powder:**
Place honey in a copper pot and gently heat it to form small cakes the size of coins. Place a mung-bean-sized amount of gold powder on each honey cake and wrap it. At dawn, face east and ingest it. After ingestion, enter a secluded chamber and sit. Avoid seeing birds or beasts, and do not engage in conversation with passersby. Simply compose your mind and silently invoke the majestic spirits of the immortals and sages of the ten directions to assist the medicine in granting you longevity. On the first day, take one pellet; on the second day, two pellets; on the third day, three pellets. Then return to taking one pellet daily. After a hundred days, you will attain transcendence.

All gold and silver contain toxins; if not meticulously refined, they may harm the person. First, refine with lead thirty-seven times; next, refine with mercury thirty-seven times; then refine with *Xuan* water three hundred and sixty times; refine with limewater for twenty-one days; steam with toxin-neutralizing ash thirty-seven times; stir-fry with toxin-neutralizing ash thirty-seven times; and refine with vinegar for twenty-one days. Only after the toxins are fully purged may it be ingested.

**Lead-Refining Gold Method:**
Use thirty-six taels of gold and seventy-two taels of lead to make an ash cup. Fire it until dry, seal the edges with honey, and leave one observation hole. Place the lead in the cup. Make an iron cup of matching size, perforated with holes on top, and fit it over the ash cup. Pile charcoal on the iron cup, cover it with mud, and fire it. When the lead is exhausted, retrieve the gold and make another ash cup. Repeat this process thirty-seven times; this is called lead-refined gold.

**Next, the Mercury-Refining Gold Method:**
Take the thirty-six taels of lead-refined gold, hammer it into thin sheets, and place it with thirty taels of mercury in a crucible. Gently warm it over a low flame and gradually add the gold sheets. Once done, seal the crucible with another vessel overnight to form a paste. Melt it in a crucible; the mercury will dissipate, leaving only gold. Repeat this process thirty-seven times; this is called mercury-refined gold. Gradually expel the toxins to recover the mercury.

**Next, the *Xuan* Water Refining Method:**
Melt the gold in a crucible and pour it into *Xuan* water—ensure it is of excellent quality. Repeat this process three hundred and sixty times; the gold will become soft and malleable. This is the *Xuan* water refining method."

**Next, the Lime Juice Refining Method:**
Take the *Xuan* water-refined gold, hammer it into thin sheets, and place it in a crucible. Boil it in lime juice for twenty-one days; this is called the lime juice refining method.

**Next, the Toxin-Dissolving Ash Refining Method:**
Hammer the gold into thin sheets, then place it in a crucible with toxin-dissolving ash juice. Boil the gold sheets for twenty-one days.

**Next, the Toxin-Dissolving Steaming Method:**
Shave bamboo into thin tubes and fill them with toxin-dissolving ash juice. Layer fine, pure sand and gold sheets alternately within the tubes until full. Seal the tube openings tightly, place them in a jar, cover with sand, and steam for twenty-one days; this is called the steaming method.

**Next, the Stir-Frying Method:**
Use a new, clean iron wok, scrubbed thoroughly. Place fine powder of toxin-dissolving dry ash inside, then break the gold sheets into small pieces and stir-fry them with the ash for twenty-one days. Use a low flame during frying—if the fire is too strong, the lead may melt. This is called the stir-frying method.

**Next, the Vinegar Refining Method:**
Use triple-fermented fine vinegar, pour it into a jar, and place the gold sheets inside. Seal the jar tightly, then boil it in a large pot of toxin-dissolving ash juice for twenty-one days until all toxins are expelled; this is called the vinegar refining method.

**Next, the Stone Juice Method:**
Use fresh, high-quality lime, steam it until its vapors rise thoroughly, then pour hot water over it to extract the juice; this is called stone juice.

**Next, the Toxin-Dissolving Ash Method:**
Mix equal parts cow dung ash and *li* stone ash. Crush magnetite, boil it thoroughly in flowing water, then use the liquid to leach the two ashes to obtain the juice. This ash can dissolve the toxins of gold and silver; it is called toxin-dissolving ash.

**Method for Burning *Li* Stone into Ash:**
*Li* stone, commonly known as "ashless wood," does not turn to ash when burned—only cow dung fire can reduce it to ash immediately. The *li* stone resembles rotten wood and is found in famous mountains; those with long veins and hardness are not genuine.

**Jade Spirit Flying Rosy Powder, Second**
This Jade Spirit Flying Rosy Powder is the treasured medicine of the Ten Great Immortals. In ancient times, Master Tai’an consumed it and attained immortality after two hundred days. Since then, the Ten Immortals have passed it down, though its wondrous effects cannot be fully described.

**Method of Preparation:**
Take twelve *jin* of the finest, most translucent, and immaculate jade. Use selenite to cut it into plates, each two *fen* thick. After cutting, wash the plates thoroughly with river water to remove the scent of selenite. Prepare the following waters: two *shi* and four *dou* of snow water, one *shi* and two *dou* each of dew water, frost water, rainwater, and well water (morning well water is best). Use fine, non-porous crucibles to hold each of the five waters separately.

First, dig a pit twelve *chi* deep. On the winter solstice, before midnight, place the crucibles into the pit. At the exact midnight hour (*zi* hour), add the five waters and jade plates, then cover with a basin and seal with a thick layer of mud to prevent qi from escaping. Place wood over the pit, cover with straw, then mud, and finally earth three *chi* thick. Erect a barrier around it to prevent people or animals from passing over. On the summer solstice at noon, retrieve them—by then, they will have absorbed the full complement of yin and yang qi.

Next, press fresh hemp seeds to extract their oil. Place a finger’s width of oil in a copper pot, add the jade plates, and boil for twenty-one days. Then, construct a special furnace with *li* stone grates to hold the jade plates. Light a fire beneath the furnace and heat for twenty-one cycles. Retrieve the jade and grind it into powder using a jade pestle, ensuring it is extremely fine—the finer, the more potent.

**Method of Consumption:**
On a day when the four seasons are in harmony with the reigning celestial stems and branches, at dawn, face east and take a square *cun* of the powder with morning well water. Consume it three times every seven days. After sixty days, your form will transform; after a hundred days, no one will recognize you; after two hundred days, you will commune with spirits; after a year, you will attain the Dao of immortality. The elderly who consume it will achieve immortality in two years.

**White Essence Life-Securing Powder, Third**
This powder was consumed by Master Yuan Yang, who attained immortality after three hundred days. He roamed freely across realms, manipulated yin and yang, and possessed boundless spiritual powers, moving without obstruction—his wonders cannot be fully described.

**Method of Preparation:**
Take thirty-six *taels* of newly smelted fine silver. Refine it with lead three times; all other refining methods follow the same procedures as for gold. After refining, use six *taels* to make a mortar, add five *fen* of refined milk, and grind them together as with gold powder.

The method of consumption is the same as for gold powder.

**Qian Yuanzi’s Yellow Spirit Ointment, Fourth**
This divine ointment was consumed by Master Qian Yuanzi, who ascended to immortality in seven days and survived two or three calamities, thereby becoming a superior immortal. Passed down by the Ten Immortals, it is sealed in a jade box and treasured as a provision for ten thousand kalpas. Among all medicines, it is the most supreme and precious—guard it well.

**Method for Preparing the Yellow Spirit Ointment:**
Take thirty pure *fuling* (poria), burn them with hempseed oil lamps until the jade plates turn red, then soak them in twelve *jin* of scallion juice. Add twenty-four *jin* of hundred-times-refined pine resin and one *shi* and two *dou* and four *sheng* of edible honey, along with thirty-six *taels* of gold powder.

Use a new copper pot to hold the honey. After placing the honey inside, first add the *fuling*, then the pine resin, and boil for two days. Finally, add the gold powder, scattering it gradually into the pot. Boil it carefully without stirring; once it boils, it will sink naturally. Boil for seven days and seven nights, and the ointment will be ready.

**Method of Consumption:**
Use the initial essence powder to form pills the size of small beans. Take three pills per dose, three times a day. After ten days, you will naturally cease eating; after twenty days, your strength will greatly increase; after sixty days, your complexion will become like jade; after a hundred days, you will attain immortality.

Take this single dose, and you shall endure through ten thousand kalpas, your divine powers unobstructed.

**Hu Chongzi’s Jade Spirit Ointment (Fifth)**
The merits of this ointment are beyond full description; here, only the essential recipe is recorded.

**Method for Jade Spirit Ointment:**
Use twenty-four *jin* of finely ground, refined *fuling*; twenty-four *jin* of finely ground, hundred-times-refined pine resin; two *shi* and four *dou* of edible honey; and twelve *jin* of jade powder. These four ingredients are prepared as follows: first place the honey in a copper pot, then add the pine resin, followed by the *fuling*, and finally the jade powder. Stir until thoroughly blended, then boil for seven days until the ointment is complete.

**Method of Consumption:**
Use the initial essence powder to form pills the size of small jujubes. Take three pills per dose, three times a day. After two hundred days, you will attain immortality.

**Zhen Huazi’s White Spirit Ointment (Sixth)**
This formula was previously lost, and the original text contains no further details.

**Grand Perfection Everlasting Elixir (Seventh)**
The original text extols its virtues at length, but here only the recipe is transcribed.

**Method for Grand Perfection Everlasting Elixir:**
Use one *jin* each of white *ma-nao* powder, white jade powder, rock crystal powder, amber powder, true pearl powder, and gold and silver powder; twelve *taels* each of coral powder, purple fluorite powder, and mica powder; one *jin* each of cinnabar powder, realgar powder, and orpiment powder; eight *taels* of *shi-feng* powder; twelve *taels* of *shi-rou* powder; one *jin* of stalactite powder; thirty-six *jin* of *fuling* powder; twenty-four *jin* of pine resin; and two *shi* and four *dou* of refined honey.

Combine these eighteen ingredients, all finely refined into powder. Wash the honey and place it in a new copper cauldron, boiling it for one day. Then, in sequence, add the powders of the various ingredients and boil them together for seven days and seven nights until the elixir is complete.

**Method of Consumption:**
On a day when the four seasons are in their dominant phase and the day’s cyclical signs do not clash, form the elixir into pills the size of small jujubes. Take three pills per dose, and you will immediately ascend as an immortal.

**Three Radiance Ointment (Eighth)**
**Method for Three Radiance Ointment:**
Use twelve *taels* each of cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, *yu-yu liang*, mica powder, *shi-rou*, stalactite, white quartz, purple fluorite, *shi-feng*, and *shi-nao*; thirty-six *jin* of *fuling*; and twenty-four *jin* of pine resin.

Refine these thirteen ingredients into fine powder. Use one *shi* and two *dou* of edible honey, place it in a copper cauldron, and add the powders of the above ingredients. Boil for seven days, then form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take three pills per dose, three times a day. After three years, you will attain immortality.

**Condensed Spirit Ointment (Ninth)**
**Method for Condensed Spirit Ointment:**
Use thirty-six *jin* of *fuling*; twenty-four *jin* of pine resin; twelve *jin* each of pine nut kernels and cypress nut kernels.

Refine these four ingredients into fine powder. Use two *shi* and four *dou* of edible honey, place it in a large copper cauldron, and boil for one day. Then, in sequence, add the powders of the various ingredients, stirring until thoroughly blended. Simmer over a low flame for seven days.

**Method of Consumption:**
Form into pills the size of small jujubes. Take seven pills per dose, three times a day. If fasting, take as many as needed to feel satiated. This will lead to cessation of eating, lightness of body, and rejuvenation from old age to youth. After two years, the Dao of immortality will be achieved.

**Initial Essence Powder (Tenth)**
Red Pine told Cloud Yangzi: “When I had not yet attained immortality, True Huazi instructed me: ‘If you seek long life and wish to study the Dao, you should first take the Initial Essence Powder, then the Condensed Spirit Ointment. If you take these two medicines first, it will be easier to refine your body and study the higher arts.’”

**Method for Initial Essence Powder:**
Use thirty-six *jin* of *fuling*; twenty-four *jin* of pine resin; and one to three *jin* of stalactite.

Refine these three ingredients into fine powder. Use three *sheng* of edible honey, stir until thoroughly blended, and place in a covered jar. Seal the opening tightly and dry in the shade for a hundred days until it becomes powdery.

**Method of Consumption:**
Take a three-*fangcun* spoonful per dose, three times a day. After taking one dose, no other powder will compare—it is most excellent. If you do not take this Initial Essence Powder and Condensed Spirit Ointment first but proceed directly to the major elixirs, their effects will be delayed.

**General Instructions for Refining Major Elixirs:**
The refinement of major elixirs must take place in a secluded mountain forest. Construct a special elixir chamber, hang swords on all four sides, and prepare Ghost-Repelling Pills and Ghost-Repelling Talismans to place and hang within. Only then may the major elixir be compounded; otherwise, ghosts and spirits will steal the essence of the medicine. Talismans and medicines must be made to repel malevolent ghosts and spirits.

**Method for Ghost-Repelling Pills:**
Use equal parts of cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, turtle shell, *yao-lu*, peach kernels, aconite, *da-banxia*, wild kudzu, sulfur, croton, raw rhinoceros horn, *gui-jiu*, musk, *gui-jian*, and centipede.

Grind and sift these seventeen ingredients, mix with the juice of orchid grass, and form into pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk. When refining the elixir, hang them on all four sides. Burn one pill in the center, and a hundred ghosts will flee. Burn another, and all ghosts will perish. This method is secret and highly effective.

**Ghost-Repelling Talisman**

The above Ghost-Repelling Talisman is to be hung on all four sides when compounding the major elixir.

**Method for Preparing Mica Powder:**
Select five-colored mica, soak it in the Five Waters, and dig a pit twelve feet deep and six feet wide. Place a jar within the pit, pour the Five Waters into the jar, and on the winter solstice at midnight, place the mica inside the jar. Seal the jar with mud, then lay wood over the pit, cover the wood with straw, the straw with mud, and the mud with earth, making the earth five feet thick. On the summer solstice at noon, retrieve the mica and roast it in a furnace until red. Then, immerse it in the Five Waters one hundred times. Next, roast it again and immerse it in the Empty Pavilion Liquid twenty-one times. The Five Waters are snow, frost, dew, rain, and well water.

**Method for Preparing Empty Pavilion Liquid:**
Take pavilion grass, select the pure portions, remove the skin and fibers, and chop finely. Pack tightly into gourds until full, seal the openings with lacquer, and on the winter solstice at midnight, dig a pit twelve feet deep. Place thirty to forty gourds inside, fill the pit with earth, and ensure no person or beast passes over it. On the summer solstice at noon, retrieve the gourds to obtain the liquid. This liquid can be used to soak gold, silver, jade, and cinnabar, transforming them into a watery or even mud-like state.

**Method for Refining Cinnabar, Realgar, Orpiment, and Sulfur:**
Take the four ingredients in fine powder form and wash them with pig intestines cleaned at the *hai* hour. Soak them in vinegar for three days, then mix the vinegar with the cinnabar and the other three ingredients, placing them separately into a pig intestine. Secure both ends tightly, place straw in a steamer, lay cloth over the straw, place the intestine on the cloth, cover it with more straw, and then earth one foot thick. Steam over a fierce fire for seven days and nights, then check for a yellow hue on the earth. Remove the ingredients and boil them in a bamboo tube with detoxifying ash liquid for twenty-one days. Finally, use the aforementioned liquid, place the cinnabar and the other three ingredients into the bamboo tube, and boil them in vinegar for another twenty-one days until the toxins are neutralized. This refined substance may then be ingested.

The oral instructions of the Heavenly Master from the *Taiqing Jing* conclude here.
