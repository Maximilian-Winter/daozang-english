**Preface to *Jinbi Wu Xiang Lei Tantong Jing***
Composed by Yinyang Changsheng

*"Param"* means **separation**; *"Tong"* means **harmonization**; *"Qi"* means **union**.
The eighty-one chapters: If a sincere scholar seeks to transmit the **Dao** of refining the **Way** and attaining true essence, the primordial mysteries of heaven and earth—**Yin** and **Yang**’s creative transformations—must first be entrusted to three individuals whose hearts and aspirations align, whose natures resonate without discord. Only then may they don the **Daoist** robes of the ten directions, still the body of chaotic thoughts, and have the disciples sweep the five-directional altar within the three-tiered square *fangzhang* (altarpiece), place the incense burner, and with pure intent, burn incense while invoking the **Three Pure Ones**. Four daggers stand erect, eight mirrors hang suspended.

The scholar, holding a thousand *liang* of gold, kneels and solemnly vows, pledges, and swears before transmitting the profound secrets of the **Daoist** scriptures. Only those who cherish the **Way** with sincerity, refining the **qi** of the **Dragon** and **Tiger** (Lead and Mercury), may attain the path to **Celestial Immortality**. Yet if encountered by thieves, rogues, or those lost in vain imaginings, the **Dao** must not be divulged—such recklessness invites eternal damnation.

Only the virtuous—those who honor parents, revere the **Dao**, cherish the **Way**, and trust in the worthy—may be initiated. Unauthorized transmission brings retribution upon seven generations. For the **Great Dao** is the origin of heaven and earth, the progenitor of **Yin** and **Yang**, the foundation of transformation.

**Scroll One: *Jinbi Wu Xiang Lei Tantong Jing***
Annotated by Yinyang Changsheng

**Exposition Chapter (1)**

Of old, the *Paramartha Tantong Jing* (Arcane Concordance) was spoken by the **Wei** sage, where *"Param"* means **separation**, *"Tong"* means **harmonization**, and *"Qi"* means **union**. To those who study the **Dao** of the **Way**, this text reveals the hidden mechanisms of the **Dao** and recognizes the primordial roots.

*"Qi"* (union) signifies the convergence of **Celestial Immortality**’s secrets with the transformations of **Yin** and **Yang**’s creative forces—this is the **Upper Concordance**. Within lies the **True Speech of Eternal Life**, elucidating the obscure yet luminous essence of the **Five Phases** in their authentic form.

The primordial roots of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations:
**Yin** and **Yang** emerge as black generating white—this is the **One** of water. Water generates metal, the **Three**. Water is said to **separate** from **Kun** (Earth), for Earth is **Yin**, **Yin** is female, female is mother, and mother originates from **Kun**, bearing vitality—thus **Kun**.

Metal resides in the northwest, belonging to **Qian** (Heaven), as **Yang**, male, father, born from **Kan** (Water). This is the primordial source of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.
Thus the scripture states:
*"The **Li** (Fire) official conceals true water within its form,
The **Kan** (Water) gate harbors hidden authentic gold."*

When **Qian** (Heaven) begets three males and **Kun** (Earth) three females, their interplay forms the **Eight Trigrams**, nurturing each other in cycles of **Eight Eights**—the **Great and Small Numbers** of **Yin** and **Yang**’s transformations.

**Do not ask others—ask only yourself.**
For the **Dao** of refining the **Way** and attaining true essence lies within one’s own body. Enlightened sages comprehend this profound truth. To seek externally is to stray forever from the **Dao**.

Many who do not grasp the **Dao**’s scriptures wander in confusion, searching outside themselves for truth. When will they ever attain the **Dao**’s essence?

The **Way** is singular and absolute—yet some still chase the **Five Metals** and **Eight Stones**, laboring to forge the elixir. How could such efforts ever succeed?

**Cinnabar, black tin, and realgar**—when refined in the furnace, they yield **Erxi Dan** (Two Radiant Elixirs).
**Cinnabar** is not the common cinnabar of the world.
**Mercury** is not the common mercury of the world.
**Black tin** is the mineral smelted from ore—this is true **Lead**. Within **Lead** lies its own refinement, its own **Silver**.

The sages take **cinnabar, black tin**, and place them in the furnace, using **realgar** as a regulator, and refine them into **Erxi Dan**. **Realgar** is not the common realgar of the world; its source is the **Wudu Mountains**, where it forms through water’s alchemy. Only with this **realgar** can the elixir be perfected.

**Cinnabar** originates from the **Southern Palace**, born in the **Bing** and **Ding** (Fire) phases.
**Black tin** comes from the **Northern Palace**, generated in the **Ren** and **Gui** (Water) phases.
**Realgar** emerges from the **Central Palace**, thriving in the **Wu** and **Ji** (Earth) phases.
When these three substances are combined in the furnace and refined into **Erxi Dan**, transformations multiply.

The **Daoist scriptures** say:
*"Medicine is not medicine; the furnace is not a furnace.
To complete the **Four Symbols**, to fulfill the **Five Phases**—
Medicine and furnace do not depart from the body.
Seek not outside."*

To seek externally is to distance oneself from **Immortal** attainment.

When **cinnabar** and **black tin** are gently refined with **realgar**, the elixir is named **Erxi Dan**.

The **elixir** is refined with **Wen** and **Wu** (Civil and Martial) **Fires**,
first transforming into **White Snow**—
its form in the **furnace** is like goose down or snowflakes,
half red and half white in hue.

When **Realgar** restrains it, it becomes **Yellow Sprout**,
like seeds planted in the earth,
gaining **Xī** (radiance) and sprouting.

**Realgar** is **Earth**—
Earth nurtures all things.
When all things die and return to Earth,
it is the **Five Phases** reverting to **One**,
and all matters conclude.

Let the **River Vehicle** (Hé Chē) be altered at will,
seven returns and reversals complete the **Xian** (completed) transformation.
See its **Yin** (Wood), recognize its **Zhen** (Earth).
In the **truth**, it is called **Jin** (Metal).
Metal can subdue Wood—
this is the **return** (Fan).
Internally, it governs the **lungs** and **liver**;
externally, it is the **Bundle West** (Shù Xī).
**Jin** is **essence** (Jīng), Wood is **fluid** (Jīn).
Essence and fluid combine—
this is the **cinnabar** (Dānshā).

Essence descends from the **Li** (Fire) **Palace** and is produced,
fluid ascends from the **Kǎn** (Water) **Palace** and is born.
The **Li** and **Kǎn** **Palaces**—
this is the **furnace of Water and Fire in Harmony** (Shuǐ Huǒ Jì Jī Dǐng).

The **River Vehicle**—
this is the **true radiance of the Northern Palace**.
When it enters the **Bundle West** (Shù Xī) **Jia** (Wood) **position**,
**Jia** and **Yǐ** (Metal) form the **Jin Hua** (Metal Flower),
a shift from **Kǎn** (Water) to **Zhèn** (Thunder/Earth).

After nine transformations, the **Purple Metal Sand** (Zǐ Jīn Shā) is formed,
illuminating our home with **gold and silver**.

**Lead** and **Mercury** (Qiān Gōng) combine with **Realgar**,
refined into the **Great Medicine** (Dà Yào),
revealing the **Heaven and Earth** (Buàn Kūn).

The **Yang** (male) **stem** weighs **192 chǐn** (铢),
totaling **384 chǐn**—
this is the measure of one **jīn** (斤).
The **Metal** weighs **8 liǎng** (两),
the **Silver** weighs **8 liǎng**—
this is the **Returned Cinnabar** (Huán Dān),
named **Purple Metal Sand**.

The **Yang** (male) **stem** is **192 chǐn**,
the **Yin** (female) **stem** is **192 chǐn**,
totaling **384 chǐn**—
this is called the **Returned Cinnabar**.

The **Great Medicine** naturally refines itself,
and when a person obtains this **elixir**,
their home is filled with **gold, silver, and seven treasures**.
**Black Crow** (Wū Sài) becomes **Phoenix** (Fèng),
**Serpent’s bait** (Shé È) turns into **Dragon**.

When consumed by humans,
it grants **long life and immortality**,
allowing them to roam the world—
these are called **Earthly Immortals** (Dì Xiān),
who later, after **800 lifetimes** (Bā Bǎi Xíng),
ascend as **Divine Immortals** (Shén Xiān).

**Recognizing the Roots and Sprouts of Medicines (Chapter Two)**
Before practicing the **Dao** (Way),
one must discern its **medicines**—
seeing the **sprouts** (Miáo) to recognize the **roots** (Gēn).
If a person cultivates their body and nourishes their life,
they must know **loss and gain** (Sǔn Yì),
discerning the **roots and sprouts** of the **medicines**,
with **black and white** clearly distinguished,
radiant and supple in appearance.

**Discarding the key** (Qiè) is called **root belt** (Gēn Dài).
Left is **discarding** (Qiè), right is **key** (Suǒ).
Beneath the **Dan Tian** (Elisir Field) of a person,
there is a **discarding** (Qiè),
within which are stored the **roots of the sun and moon** (Rì Yuè Zhī Gēn),
day and night revolving,
through the **four seasons** (Sì Shí Zhōu Zhā).

Refined in the **three Dan Tians** (Sān Tiān),
this is the **vital essence of the Three Souls** (Sān Hún Zhī Yào),
the source of the **Great Medicine** (Dà Yào) and **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Dān).

Called **Supporting the Spleen and Calming the Souls** (Fú Líng Ān Hún),
**Ginseng** (Rén Shēn) stabilizes the **Spirit** (Pò).
These are not mere **herbs** (Cǎo).

**Supporting the Spleen** (Fú Líng) is black on the outside and white within,
**Ginseng** (Rén Shēn) is red and yellow externally,
wrapped in green and white—
these are the **visible roots and sprouts** of the **medicines**.

To cultivate and nourish,
one must recognize the **true roots and sprouts**—
this is the **mystery**.

When collecting,
use the **true essence of the Two Eights** (Èr Bā Zhēn).
The **medicines** inherently contain **true butter and milk** (Zhēn Sū Lào).

The **Two Eights** (Èr Bā) refer to **Mǎo** (Wood) and **Yǒu** (Metal),
also called **Metal and Wood in Mutual Subduction** (Jīn Mù Xiāng Kè).

The upper **Mǎo** (Wood) is the **Dragon** (Lóng),
the **Dragon** being **blood** (Xuè).
The lower **Yǒu** (Metal) is the **Tiger** (Hǔ),
the **Tiger** being **marrow** (Suǐ).

When **marrow and blood** harmonize,
this is called **butter and milk** (Sū Lào).
**Butter and milk**—
this is the **essence and radiance of the sun and moon** (Rì Yuè Zhī Jīng Huá).
A practitioner who attains this substance
can achieve **long life, perpetual youth, and immortality** (Cháng Shēng Jiǔ Shì Bù Sǐ),
ascending as a **Divine Immortal** (Shén Xiān)
and passing through the **Southern Palace** (Nán Guān).

This is when the **sun and moon** generate **Kǎn** (Water) **height** (Gāo),
forming **Water and Fire in Harmony** (Shuǐ Huǒ Jì Jī).
The foundation is of the **Lead and Mercury** (Qiān Gōng) **type**.

The **Civil and Martial Fires** (Wén Wǔ Huǒ) are the **functions of the four seasons** (Sì Shí Gōng).
**Closing and inhaling** (Bì Xī) to **absorb radiance** (Nà Xī),
the **nine-one** (Jiǔ-Yī) measure in restraint—
this is the **upper collection of Wood and Fire fluids** (Jīn),
the **lower extraction of Metal and Water essences** (Jīng),
entering the **Central Palace** (Zhōng Guān),
using **Earth** to combine into the **Great Medicine**.

**Slow pounding** (Màn Dǎo) must be precise in measure.
**Slow pounding**—
this is the **sequence of operations** (Gōng Chéng).
**Closing and inhaling** to **store and contract** (Cún Suō),
drawing and absorbing to obtain **Earth** (Tǔ),
combining and inhaling to form the **Fire** (Huǒ) **pattern** (Fāng)—
then refining the **cinnabar** (Dānshā),
forming the **medicine’s body** (Yào Tǐ),
which naturally emits **divine light** (Shén Guāng).
The complexion becomes joyous and radiant,
**reverting aging to youth** (Fǎn Lǎo Huán Tóng),
the body strong and light,
movement swift as a galloping horse,
strength doubled as usual,
hearing sharp and vision clear.
When the **virtue/power** (Dé) is fulfilled,
**purple mist** (Zǐ Wù) envelops the feet,
and wherever they go,
the **Three Souls, Seven Spirits, Five Zàng Organs, Six Fǔ Entrails, Six Ding, Six Jia** (Sān Hún Qī Pò Wǔ Zàng Liù Fǔ Shí Dīng Shí Jiǎ),
and the **land spirits** (Tǔ Dì) follow.
**Demons and malevolent entities** (Wǎng Liǎng Jiān) see them
and retreat, not daring to approach or harm.

**Black Crow** (Wū Sài) becomes **Phoenix** (Fèng),
**Serpent’s bait** (Shé È) turns into **Dragon**.
When the **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Yè Huán Dān) is formed,
the **Vermilion Bird** (Zhū Què) naturally manifests as **Phoenix**.
The **perfectly harmonized practitioner** (Tōng) spontaneously transforms
into the **victorious serpent** (Shèng Shé) as **Dragon**.

When the **harmony** (Tōng) aligns with the **intent** (Yì),
they ascend on **cloud dragons** (Yún Lóng),
gaining the ability to **ride the phoenix** (Kua Fèng).

If there are those who practice the **Dao**,
they need only **resolve to refine Lead and Mercury** (Zhì Liàn Qiān Gōng Zào Huà),
endlessly transforming.
When the **Golden Elixir** (Jīn Dān) is formed,
**fire cannot burn it** (Huǒ Bù Néng Shāo),
**water cannot drown it** (Shuǐ Bù Néng Nì),
and even as an **Earthly Immortal** (Dì Xiān),
they face no obstacles.

**Chapter on Operations (Chapter Three)**
The **operations** are performed in **winter, summer, and the transitional seasons** (Dōng Xià Jì Chūn Qiū).
The **four seasons** (Sì Shí)—
these are the **beginning of spring, summer, autumn, and winter** (Lì Chūn, Lì Xià, Lì Qiū, Lì Dōng),
which mark the **four symbols** (Sì Xiàng) as their **heads** (Tóu).

**Spring** spans **72 days** (Qī Shí Èr Rì),
**Summer** spans **72 days**,
**Autumn** spans **72 days**,
**Winter** spans **72 days**—
this is the **Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water** (Mù Huǒ Jīn Shuǐ)
**Four Symbols** governing the **four beginnings** (Sì Mèng Tóu).

The **Yin-Yang transformations** of great and small numbers—
**Yin (寅) and Shen (申)** are **Metal and Wood** (金木),
where **mutual destruction and generation** (相刑相生) occur.
Their **physical forms** (体) together span **388 years** (三百八十八年之数).
Using the **four beginnings** (四孟) sparingly,
in **Winter**, **four or five days** (四五日) suffice—
this yields **190 years**, the **greater reckoning** (大数).
For lesser operations (功小者),
using the **four seasons daily** (日用四时) also yields **190 cycles** (一百九十数).
Calculating the **Yin-Yang transformations** (阴阳造化) of great and small numbers—
this is the **ineffable work of the divine and sagely** (神明不测之功).

**Wei (巳) and Hai (亥)** mark the **return to the Eight Trigrams’ origin** (还八卦头).
**Wei (巳)** is **Fire** (火),
called the **fourth month** (四月), the **pure Yang body** (纯阳之体),
its **Trigram** corresponding to **Qian (乾)**, the **Heaven**.
**Hai (亥)** is **Water** (水),
called the **tenth month** (十月), the **pure Yin body** (纯阴之体),
its **Trigram** corresponding to **Kun (坤)**, the **Earth**.
**Heaven and Earth unite** (天地相合),
with **six Yin and six Yang** (六阴六阳) fully present.

From **Zi (子) to Wei (巳)**, half the year’s count—
the **initial *Fu* (复) Hexagram of Earth Thunder** (地雷《复》) begins,
with **six Yang lines** (六阳爻) complete.
From **Wu (午) to Hai (亥)**, half the year’s count—
the **initial *Gou* (遘) Hexagram of Heaven Wind** (天风《遘》) begins,
with **six Yin lines** (六阴爻) complete.

The **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) manifests in its **nine returns** (九还),
called **Water and Fire in Perfect Union** (水火既济).
**Water and Fire** contend yet are **controlled** (相克而制之),
the **root essence** (根元) attaining its **true form** (正体)—
the **Great Elixir** is complete (大药成).

**Daily conjunctions** (日会) of **Jia (甲), Geng (庚), Ren (壬), and Bing (丙)**—
**mutual destruction and containment** (相克相包) seek the **Four Symbols** (四象).
**Jia (甲)**, the **Wood position** (木位), in the **northern bundle** (束北),
reaches the **28th day** of the month—
here, **Earth consumes its ally** (地而丧朋),
**Yang arises, Yin perishes** (阳生阴灭).
**Geng (庚)**, the **Metal position** (金位), in the **southwest** (西南),
appears on the **third day** of the month in **Geng’s domain** (庚地)—
here, **Earth gains its ally** (地而得朋),
**Yin arises, Yang perishes** (阴生阳灭).
**Ren (壬)** is **Water**, **Yang Water** (水是阳), born from the **Sun’s spirit** (日魂).
**Bing (丙)** is **Fire**, **Yin Fire** (是阴), born from the **Moon’s shadow** (月魄).
The **Moon’s shadow** (月魄) is **Metal’s radiance** (金之熙), **Yin within Yang** (阳中阴).
The **Sun’s spirit** (日魂) is **Wood’s radiance** (木之熙), **Yang within Yin** (阴中阳).

Thus, **Yin-Yang transformations** (阴阳造化) originate in **Kan (坎) and Li (离)**—
**mutual destruction and containment** (相克相包),
**reciprocal concealment** (互相包藏).
**Ren (壬) generates Jia (甲)**, **Bing (丙) generates Geng (庚)**—
this is the **Four Symbols’ pursuit** (四象求),
entering the **Central Furnace** (入官鼎).
The **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) then **transforms** (方变成).

As the **Classics say**:
**Wood governs the Azure Dragon** (木主青龙),
**Metal forms the White Tiger** (金作白虎),
**the Sun is the Vermilion Bird** (日为朱雀),
**the Moon is the Dark Warrior** (月为玄武).
When the **Four Symbols converge** (四象交会),
they enter the **Central Furnace** (入於中官).
**Eternal Life** never departs from **Wu (戊) and Ji (己), the Earth** (长生不离於戊己土),
as **Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** coalesce into **dust** (金木水火以成尘).
One does not know who first takes dominion—
**the common folk misunderstand the Sage’s words** (世人不晓圣人言),
**using their own shallow judgments** (自用胸襟不师古),
**misleading others along erroneous paths** (更将错路指迷人),
**unaware their bodies crumble to ash** (不觉身姐为灰土).

I **urge the alchemist** to refine the **True Tiger** (劝人炼药须真虎),
**Yang embracing Yin** (阳得阴兮自并互).
When the **work is complete**, it relies on the **Ninefold City** (九重城),
**consuming it for a thousand days** (饵之千日) to **ascend** (身腾举).

This is the **Four Symbols’ pursuit** (四象求) of **Ren (壬), Bing (丙), Jia (甲), and Geng (庚)**—
the **true Metal, Wood, Water, Earth, and Fire** (真金、木、水、土、火是的也).
**Water and Fire** **reverse in the True Furnace** (水火翻易真鼎器),
the **River Vehicle** (河车) **turns**, while **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** remain.
The **Four Symbols** emerge from **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** (四象生於戊己),
for **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** are **preeminent** (为尊).
The **Four Symbols** rely on **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)** to **complete** (而成).
Without **Wu (戊) and Ji (己)**, the **Four Symbols** cannot form,
and the **Five Phases lack a master** (五行无主).
**Wu (戊)** is **Earth**, **Ji (己)** is **dung** (粪),
yet **dung and Earth unite** as **one virtue** (相合为一德).
The **Classics say**:
**Heaven attains One and becomes clear** (天得一者清),
**Earth attains One and becomes tranquil** (地得一者宁),
**the Elixir attains One and is complete** (药得一者成),
**Man attains One and becomes divine** (人得一者灵).
**Earth is the sovereign of all things** (土为万物主),
**all things are born from Earth and return to Earth** (万物得土而生，万物因土而死归土).

The **Four Symbols**—**Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire**—
enter the **Central Furnace** (来入中官),
only then **returning to the Vessel** (方归鼎器).
The **Vessel** (鼎器) is the **marrow of the Elixir’s body** (丹药体中髓).
The **Azure Dragon and White Tiger** emerge from **south and north** (青龙白虎生南北),
**beasts subduing one another within the Furnace** (禽制相伏鼎中游).

The **Azure Dragon**, **Master of Wood** (青龙木之主), is **Lead** (为铅),
born from the **northern Ren (壬) and Gui (癸)** (从北方壬癸#2中而生).
The **White Tiger**, **Master of Metal** (白虎金之主), is **Mercury** (为汞),
produced from the **southern Bing (丙) and Ding (丁)** (从南方丙、丁而产).
**Mercury** is born from **#3 Cinnabar** (朱砂中),
**externally red** (外赤应阳), **internally Mercury** (内生水银是阴).
**Lead** is mined from **stone** (产於石中),
**internally and externally black** (内外黑应阴), refined into **silver** (炼出白银是#4阴).
**Lead** is **essence** (津), called **Jade Nectar** (玉液), or **Hua Pool Water** (华池水).
**Mercury** is **spirit** (精), called **Indigo** (曾青), or **Law Water** (法水).
These **two substances** are **one in origin** (二物本一体),
until the **Mid-Autumn Festival** (中元朝), when the **Red Emperor** (赤帝) **allocates them** (分配归於上下).
The **upper is Lead, Yang** (上者铅是阳),
the **lower is Mercury, Yin** (下者汞是阴).
When **Yin and Yang unite**, they yield the **Yellow Mother** (得黄婆),
and the **Great Elixir is formed** (方成大药)—
this is the **Dragon and Tiger’s play within the Furnace** (此是龙虎鼎中游).

**The Golden Lord** (金公) **seeks the Yellow Mother** (自觅黄婆),
**inquiring how to unite with the Jade Maiden** (问要与玉女会绸缪).
The **Golden Lord** is named **Yingxiong** (婴兄).
The **Jade Maiden** is named **Mercury** (名日汞也).
When **Lead and Mercury unite** (铅汞相合),
they enter the **Central Furnace** (入中官鼎内).
The **Furnace** is the **Yellow Mother** (鼎者，黄婆也).
It is called the **Dan Field** (丹田),
**Earth generating Five** (土从一生五),
**Five returning to One** (五合於一) — **the Sixfold Cycle** (谓之六).
This is the **essence of the Sun and Moon’s radiance** (日精月华),
the **Sun’s spirit and Moon’s shadow** (日魂月魄),
the **silver exterior and gold interior** (银表金裹之体).

---
**Chapter on Lead and Mercury (Chapter Four)**
**Lead and Mercury** share a **single origin** (并生时本体).
**Lead and Mercury** are the **root of the Lower Dan Field** (下元命门之根),
produced in the **abandoned key** (弃钥中),
**born in the kidneys** (生於肾).
The **left kidney governs Ren (壬)**, the **right kidney governs Gui (癸)**.
The **two kidneys** (肾之二) **unite as one** (合为一体).
This is **Lead and Mercury’s single origin** (是铅汞本一体),
**one representing Lead**, the **other Mercury** (一象铅，一象汞).
**Ascending and descending**, they **separate** (上下飞分),
**south and north** (南北) **pair with Kan and Li** (离官坎户配相随),
**reversing above and below** (上下翻变) with **Lead and Mercury**.
**Mercury** is **Yang**, **Wood** (为木), also called the **Infant** (婴儿),
or the **Sun’s spirit** (日魂), or the **Sun’s essence** (日精).
**Lead** is **Yin**, **Metal** (为金), also called the **Bride** (媳女).
Thus, the **Classics say**:
**Kan (坎) is male, Li (离) is female** (坎男离女为夫妇),
**Water and Fire are the Great Elixir** (水火为大药).
This is the **true male and true female** (真男真女),
the **true Water and true Fire** (真水真火),
the **true Lead and true Mercury** (真铅真汞) —
the **essential divine operations** (要妙神用也矣).

**Gold and Silver** are the **true essence** (金银便是真宗的),
**reversed above and below** (上下翻作两般名).
**Gold and Silver** are the **true radiance of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之正熙),
called the **upper and lower strings** (谓之上下两弦).

「On the third day of each month, the moon appears at **Geng** (庚);
on the twenty-eighth day, it appears at **Jia** (甲);
on the eighth and twenty-third days, it manifests at the **Li** (离) and **Kan** (坎) positions respectively.
It is also said:
**The luminous transformations of Yin and Yang** (显阴阳变转) give rise to the **cosmic shaping** (造化成形),
**fullness in the first fifteen days** (前十五日而圆) and **waning in the latter fifteen days** (后十五日而缺).
This is called the **foundation of the twenty-eighth** (此谓二八之基),
where **Yin and Yang’s numerical lines are complete** (阴阳数爻俱备).
The remaining days have **augmentations, diminutions, excesses, and reversals** (增亏盈反),
and are called the **□** [missing character] **Child-Midday cycle** (子午日分阴阳之足数).
The **Classics say**:
**The souls of the sun and moon** (日月魂魄) arise from **Kan and Li** (因生坎离).
This is the **true interaction of Gold and Wood** (金木之□),
**Water and Fire** (水火) forming their essence.
**Conceiving the embryo** (感胞胎), **nurturing the Elixir** (养还丹),
**changing hue and altering appearance** (以变色动容),
**results in the Four Divine Elixirs** (成为四神丹), the **Four Transformations’ Medicine** (四转之药).

**Yin and Yang’s reversed transformations** (阴阳翻变) traverse the **Nine Domains** (九域),
**Kan and Li’s positions** (坎户离宫) manifest their **interactive changes** (显变通).
**Seeking the true radiance of Yin and Yang** (探阴阳之正熙),
**preserving the essence and vital fluids** (存精津) yields completion.
The **key is the seven-eight cycle** (要用七八之数),
employing the **four times of the Tiger, Monkey, Dragon, and Pig** (寅、申、巳、亥).
**Refining Fire below** (下火煅烧) ensures **Lead does not ascend** (铅无飞),
**Mercury does not flee** (汞不走),
but when arranged within the **Central Furnace** (中官鼎),
it can transform into **White Horse Tooth** (白马牙).

Yet with the **Daoist Pill** (刀圭),
**natural Jade Nectar** (玉液) is called **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),
and **Cinnabar Elixir** (丹砂) is achieved.
**Seven returns** (七返) use **Tiger** (寅) as the head,
**corresponding to the Hexagram of *Tai*** (卦应地天《泰》),
where **three Yin and three Yang lines intersect** (三阴三阳交遘),
called **internal resonance with the liver** (内应其肝),
**external manifestation as Wood** (外象於木).
**Tiger** (寅) is the **fourth of the Months** (四孟), called the **longest** (谓其长).
**Zhen** (震) is among them, and **Tiger** (寅) may be used,
but **not Dragon** (卯) should be employed.
**Monkey** (申) corresponds to the Hexagram of *Pi* (卦应天地《否》),
called **the negation of Yin and Yang** (阴阳否极泰来),
**when *Tai* reaches its peak, *Pi* arrives** (泰极否至),
**interacting harmoniously with the times** (交泰随时),
**three Yang and three Yin lines return and unfold** (三阳三阴返覆而生),
**internally resonating with the lungs** (内应其肺),
**externally manifesting as the Metal of the West** (外应其西方金).
**Monkey** (申) in the **West** (西位) is **Metal** (金), also belonging to the **Months** (孟);
**Dui** (兑) is the **second of the Months** (仲), and **Monkey** (申) may be used,
but **not You** (酉) should be employed.
**The Dragon does not lie dormant** (龙不伏), **the Tiger moves freely** (虎自走).
**Tiger and Monkey** (寅申) are the **Seven Returns’ Spirit Sand** (七返灵砂),
**three transformations and returns** (三变转还).

The **Nine Domains** (九域) are formed by the **Nine Colors** (九色),
**arising from the gate of transformation** (变转之门从□生):
**White, Yellow, Red, Black, Green, Blue, Scarlet, Purple** (白、黄、赤、徘、绿、碧、红、紫).
**Nine transformations** (变转九色) are called **Nine Returns** (九还),
known as the **Nine Domains** (号为九域).
**From the Heart and Kidney’s reversal** (从心肾翻成),
it is said: **Sun in Li’s position, Moon in Kan’s** (日离官坎户).
**The Heart** (心) belongs to **Yin** (阴), **the Kidney** (肾) to **Yang** (阳),
thus it is called **Yin and Yang’s reversed transformation** (阴阳翻变).
**The souls of the sun and moon** (日月魂魄) are treasured by **Daoist Immortals** (仙人惜),
**gathering to refine the Three Fields** (会炼三田) depending on **Precious Essence** (依宝珍),
**the Daoist Pill** (刀圭) being the **true treasure** (自要仙人吃).
**Sun’s soul and Moon’s spirit** (日魂月魄) are the **true essence** (精) and **vital fluid** (津)
**interacting within the Three Furnaces** (往来於三官),
the **true radiance of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之真熙).
**Daoist Immortals treasure this** (仙人惜此) as it is **the human root** (是人根柢),
hence the reverence.

**Gathering to refine the Three Fields** (会炼三田) means
**the true essence** (熙) **interacting within the Three Furnaces** (往来於三官),
**refining the Three Corpses** (炼三尸) to **self-annihilation** (而自亡灭),
**returning the Elixir** (却还丹) to become **Purple Gold** (紫金),
**perfectly round, an inch in diameter** (方圆径寸),
**weighing a pound** (可重一斤),
called **the true essence of Yin and Yang** (阴阳正熙结成真金).
This is called the **true Daoist Pill** (真刀圭),
**the Central Furnace’s vessel** (是中鼎器谓之刀圭).
It is also called **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),
**fragrant and savory** (有香味),
**like chrysanthemum yet yellow** (若菊花而黄色),
**a true person’s delight** (真人地仙俱所好吃用),
hence it is called the **Daoist Pill** (故日刀圭),
**the red blade, the white standard** (刀赤圭白).

**Chapter Five on Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit** (日魂月魄章第五):
**Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit emerge from Kan and Li** (日魂月魄出坎离),
**Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit** (日月魂魄) are the **true essence of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之熙结).
**Sun’s Soul** (日魂) **ascends from Kan’s position** (从坎户而上),
**manifesting as Wood’s essence** (应其铅) and forming **Jade Nectar** (为之玉液),
**located atop the Hua Gai** (在华盖之上).
**The souls emerging within the orifices** (在窍中所出日魂月魄),
**produced from the Three Furnaces** (从三官而产),
**descend to manifest as Mercury** (是熙下应其汞),
forming **Golden津** (为之金津).
**The four seasons interact and circulate** (四时上下来往交感),
**never leaving the Three Fields** (不离三田),
**descending to the Lower Elixir Field** (下归下丹田),
**the Tail Vein Cavity** (尾闲穴),
**three cavities ascending from the right orifice** (有三穴从右穴而上行),
**transforming into flowing pearls** (变为流珠).
**Ascending to enter the Mud Nine** (上入泥九),
**congealing into bone marrow** (凝於骨髓),
**it becomes Gold** (化为金),
**bone marrow transforming into flowing pearls** (骨髓变为流珠).

**When Jia meets Geng** (甲会庚时), **the divine mechanism shifts** (神机变也).
**The returned Elixir** (还丹) **enters Ren and Bing** (壬丙入希夷).
**Bing** (丙) is **Fire** (火), **Ren** (壬) is **Water** (水),
**Water and Fire** (水火) **are the completed *Ji Ji* Hexagram** (为既济).
**The Four Furnaces contain the Great Medicine** (鼎四中大药已成),
hence it is called **Hi Yi** (希夷).
**Hi Yi** (希夷) is the **root of the Five Phases** (之五行之根),
**arising from a single dou measure** (从一斗而生),
**transforming through Nine Returns** (化通九转),
also called **from Earth’s congealing** (从土结),
**known as the returned Elixir** (谓曰还丹).
**Jia** (甲) is **Wood** (木), **Geng** (庚) is **Metal** (金),
**Metal and Wood mutually restraining** (金木相刑) **achieves perfection** (乃成真).
**Earth, Metal, and Wood** (土、金、木) are the **foundation of the medicine** (药之本也).

**When a person awakens** (人之悟也),
**they realize the sacred principle** (悟其圣理),
**and act to refine Lead and Mercury** (动行修於铅汞),
**thus harmonizing the divine mechanism** (自合神机).
**The *Fu* line** (《复》爻) **and *Gou* form** (《遘》体) are the **two mechanisms** (是两机).

**Gold and Silver’s Five Analogies** (金碧五相类)
**from *Parameter of the Mysterious* (参同契) Volume Middle**
**Commentary on Yin’s Long Life** (阴长生注)

「Gold and Silver’s Five Analogies (金碧五相类)»

**The Seventh: Gold Essence and Silver Dew (金津玉液)**
Gold Essence arises from the **Kan** (坎) Palace’s **child position** (户),
Silver Dew is produced from the **Li** (离) Palace’s **noon position** (宫).
Gold Essence is the **vital essence** (精) from the **Kan** Palace’s child position.
The **Kan** Palace’s Gold Essence is the **kidney** (肾).
Silver Dew is the **saliva** (津), born from the **Li** Palace’s noon position.
The **Li** Palace is the **heart** (心).
When **vital essence** (精) and **saliva** (津) merge into the **central palace** (中官),
They form the **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药), called the **two True Ones of Lead and Mercury** (铅汞二真).
Both **essences** (两般) are one in origin,
Yet divided into **Yin and Yang** (二仪) through their **boundaries** (界).
Lead is the **saliva** (津), Mercury is the **vital essence** (精),
Together refined through their **boundaries** (界) to completion.
Thus, from the **Li** Palace’s noon position,
They are divided into **Yin and Yang** (阴阳), the **transformative principles** (造化) of the **Heavenly Dao** (本一物).
Yet split into **two forms** (二体),
They **return and merge** (卸以相合用) to forge the **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药).
The **Great Elixir of Gold** (金丹大药) **forms in the East** (大东结).

**When one attains it** (就),
**The Five Grains grow spontaneously** (五谷自徐),
**The Three Corpses vanish** (三尸自亡),
And **longevity is secured** (人乃长生延年).
A **hundred thousand kalpas** (百万劫) as a **Celestial Immortal** (天仙),
Forever beyond the **fall into the mundane** (堕於凡世问).
Yet **those who seek it in vague confusion** (但於恍恍惚惚觅),
Find **its form in the boundless void** (杳冥自有形).
In **vague confusion** (恍恍惚惚),
There **is substance within the void** (其中有物),
Called **the void containing reality** (虚中有实).
**Darkness within brilliance** (污中熙) is **boundless void** (杳杳冥冥),
Where **vital essence dwells** (其中有精) like **moonlight** (月中).
This is the **union of Yang Vital Essence and Yin Saliva** (是阳精与阴津) to form the **Great Elixir** (大药),
For **where there is elixir, there is the numinous** (有药自有神).
The **numinous** (神) is **breath** (息).
One is **water** (水), two is **fire** (火),
Fire **generates earth** (能生土), and earth **nourishes the numinous** (生神).
The **void carriage** (空车) **saves on substance** (省实),
For **the Dao is born from the void** (无中道自成).
Without the **Dao**, **pure Yang cannot forge the elixir** (纯阳不成丹).
The **Dao** is **the completion of cultivation and refinement** (修养之成).
**Blood** (血) four is **water** (水),
**Blood** (血) one is **fire** (火),
Fire **generates earth** (能生土), and earth **nourishes the numinous** (生神).
This is called **one body of Yang Vital Essence** (一体场精),
And **one body of Yin Vital Essence** (一体日阴精).
The **Dao’s completion** (道省成) is called **addition** (添),
**Brilliance transforms into saliva** (熙化为津),
**Saliva transforms into blood** (津化为血),
And **blood replenishes the vital essence** (血补於精).
The **vital essence** (精) is the **numinous** (神),
The **numinous** (神) sustains the **body’s vitality** (体印健).
If **one nourishes the numinous** (偶存神但养) while **preserving its essence** (存神之理),
The **Dao’s completion** (道) is naturally attained.
Yet if **one nourishes brilliance** (养熙) without **preserving the numinous** (不得存神之理),
Thus the **classic says**: Pure Yin, one Yin, one Yang is called the **Dao** (是谓道).
Its **root lies in the transformative principles** (本因造化体),
Where **Yin and Yang shift and flourish** (阴阳变通荣).
**Brilliance is Yang** (熙者为阳), **vital essence is Yin** (精者为阴),
Their **interaction as Yin and Yang** (阴阳相感) is the **correct principle** (为正).
The **correct principle** (正界) is the **foundation of human life** (人之根柢).
When **brilliance is scattered** (溅散), the **numinous is lost** (神不东).
When **brilliance is gathered** (聚), the **numinous is purified** (神自清),
Then **longevity may be attained** (方可得长生).
The **numinous and brilliance** (神熙) **are life** (为命),
This is the **root of Metal and Wood** (是金木之宗).
Through **the transformative principles** (造化),
They **shift and flourish** (变通荣).
When **one’s body is joyous** (其身悦),
Their **luster naturally thrives** (其泽自得昌盛),
**Reverting aging to youth** (返老还童),
Thus **this method achieves the true numinous Immortal** (是以此法成真神仙).

**Seven Returns and Nine Circulations** (九还并七返),
**The Heavenly and Earthly cycles** (乾坤) are their **stages of completion** (是功程).
The **Seven Returns** (七返) are from **Yin** (寅) to **Yin** (申),
Three Yang, three Yin,
Six **numbers** (数) that **mirror half a year** (可象半年),
Called the **True Six** (正六).
From **Yin** (申) to **Yin** (寅) are three Yin, three Yang,
Also six **numbers** (数) that **mirror half a year** (可象半),
Named the **Seven True** (七正).
The **return** (返) is called **intertwining at the spine** (交夹脊),
Ascending to the **brain’s palace** (上至脑户),
Descending to the **Silver Spring** (却下玉泉).
The **Seven Returns and Nine Circulations** (七返九还) are:
Six Yang, three Yin **numbers** (数) from **Wei** (巳) to **Hai** (亥),
**Hai** returns to **Wei** (却至巳) in their **process** (行).
From the **tail’s void orifice** (尾闲穴),
The **vital essence returns** (返入) to the **Golden Bone** (金骨),
And **ascends through the Central Dao** (中道).
From the **Nest of Mud** (泥丸),
It **passes through the Twelve Orifices of the Heavy Palace** (度重楼十二环).
To the **Red Sovereign** (赤帝君),
It **flows downward to the Elixir Field** (流行下丹田).
To the **Yellow Sovereign** (黄元君),
It **later enters the Golden Hall** (后入金堂),
And **is stored in the Treasure Vessel** (收入宝鉼藏).
One name is **Divine Elixir** (神丹),
Two is **Treasure Tortoise** (宝龟),
Three is **Scarlet Gold Elixir** (赫赤金丹),
Four is **Threefold True Fire** (三昧真火).
These are the **Nine Circulations** (九转),
Manifesting the **Nine-colored lights** (九色之光) of the **Nine Returns** (九还).

**The Eighth: Divine Water and Emerald Green (神水曾青)**
Divine Water and Emerald Green are **two names** (分两名),
**Flowing and circulating above and below** (上下通流各别行).
Divine Water is the **saliva** (津) within the mouth,
Beneath the tongue,
Originating from the **left kidney** (左肾) and **ascending inversely** (而逆上),
Passing through the **Li** Palace (过离官),
Mostly becoming the **fluid of the Flowering Pool** (华池之浆).
Thus the **song says**: Divine Water, the Flowering Pool’s fluid, the world seeks in vain,
Transmitted secretly, not to be known by mortals.
Emerald Green is the **vital essence** (精) born where **the waste is discarded** (弃钥所生),
From the **right kidney** (右肾) it **flows** (而行),
Ascending inversely through the **Li** Palace (离官),
Descending to emerge at the **Silver Spring** (玉泉).
Thus the **song says**: Emerald Green has a path to the **Rare and Exalted** (希夷),
Its traces are left only for those of **resolute intent** (志人知).
From **one substance** (一物),
**Divided into two forms** (分其二形), called **saliva and vital essence** (津精).
Above and below, they **flow through separate channels** (别行各道),
Realizing the **principles of saliva and vital essence** (津精之理),
One grasps the **sentiments of Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger** (便是铅汞龙虎之情),
And **attains the void of vague confusion** (达恍惚),
**Reaching the boundless darkness** (得遂杳冥).

Divine Water **originates from Bing and Ding** (本从丙丁出),
Emerald Green **is born from Ren and Gui** (生在壬癸情).
**Bing** (丙) is **Fire’s birth in the South** (南方生於巳), **Yang** (属阳).
**Ding** (丁) is **Fire’s birth in the South** (南方生於未), **Yin** (属阴).
**Clasping Li** (夹其离), Li is **two Yang at its ends** (两头是阳),
And **one Yin at its center** (中心是阴).
The **Divine Water** (神水) it **produces** (所生) is called:
One, **Silver Dew** (玉液),
Two, **Lead** (铅),
Three, **Dragon** (龙),
Four, **Young Brother** (婴兄),
Five, **Golden Official** (金公),
Six, **Taoist Sun Butter** (太阳酥).
Emerald Green **is born from Ren and Gui** (生在壬癸).
**Ren** (壬) is **Water’s birth in the North** (北方生於亥), **Yang** (属阳).
**Gui** (癸) is **Water’s birth in the North** (北方生於丑), **Yin** (属阴).
**Clasping Kan** (夹其坎), Kan is **two Yin at its ends** (两头是阴),
And **one Yang at its center** (中心是阳).
The **Emerald Green** (曾青) it **produces** (所生) is called:
One, **Golden Dew** (金液),
Two, **Mercury** (汞),
Three, **Tiger** (虎),
Four, **Young Sister** (妮女),
Five, **Jade Essence** (玉质),
Six, **Dharma Water** (法水).
This is the **Heavenly and Earthly transformative principles** (阴阳造化),
Where **Ren and Gui mutually transform** (壬癸通变),
Thus **one must recognize them** (故要识也).

**Those who awaken to the Immortal’s principles** (有人自悟仙经理),
**See the Great Elixir forming** (便见还丹大药成).
**Even cultivators refining the Dao** (几有修养道人),
**Who realize the *Parameter of the Mysterious*’s logic** (自悟《参同》之理),
The **Great Elixir** (金丹大药) **naturally completes itself** (自然成).
In **a moment**, it **transmits its oral instructions** (须臾传之口诀),
Thus the **classic has songs** (故经有歌) saying:
**"The Five Phases of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth** (所言金木水火土),
**Preserve the body, safeguard life as Dragon and Tiger** (留身保命是龙虎).
**Learners fail to recognize the Five Phases’ vital essences** (学人不认五行精),
**And forcefully acknowledge others as their parents** (强认他人为父母).
**Wood governs brilliance** (木主熙), **Metal is the Tiger** (金作虎),
**Flesh mirrors earth** (肉象土), **blood is water** (血为水)."

The **Dao of Immortality** lies in the **Celestial Official** (离官),
Mastering the **true essence of the Five Phases** (五行真有主).
The **Great Elixir** must be **mercury-essence pearls** (还丹须是水银珠),
Yet **jade-like purity** (玉质) **cannot be its consort** (那堪为伴倡).
But **awakening to this truth** (但悟此言) **reaches the Dao/Way of the Immortal** (达神仙),
And **harmonizes with the High Exalted** (铃与高尊为朋倡).

Seek the **Central Palace’s furnace-vessel** (须向中宫寻鼎器),
Calculating **Eight Gates’ functions** (八门相应计功程).
The **Central Palace’s furnace-vessel** (中官鼎器) **is the Yellow Primordial Lord** (是黄元君也).
The **Eight Gates** (八门者) are:
**Rest, Birth, Injury, Blockage, Eclipse, Death, Shock, and Opening** (休、生、伤、杜、景、死、惊、开).
Called **Eight Gates**, they are the **daily applications of the Eight Trigrams** (是日用八卦之应),
Beginning at **Eight**, dwelling in the Central Palace,
To **operate and refine** (使若运用功程下工夫也).
Only when **Water and Fire** (水火者) **achieve *Completed Success*** (成既济)—
**Jing-essence, Vitality, Brilliance, and Breath** (津、精、熙、息是也)—
**Above is Water, below is Fire** (上有水，下有火),
The **Elixir is forged and completed** (其丹炼之而成).
If **no miscalculation in breath-counting** (不令差错息数),
One may **reach a thousand days as an Immortal** (可至千日为神仙).
The **Southern Palace’s register of Immortals** (上方南官列名簿)
Records the names of **those who cultivate the Dao** (於修学道人名姓注矣).

**Chapter Nine: Solar Essence and Lunar Luster**
**Solar Essence** (日精) **and Lunar Luster** (月华),
When **united, refine into cinnabar** (相合炼成砂).
**Solar Essence** (日精者) **is the brilliance of Wood** (木之熙).
**Lunar Luster** (月华者) **is the brilliance of Metal** (金之熙).
Wood is **Yang** (木谓之阳), Metal is **Yin** (金谓之阴),
Their union **forms the *Cinnabar of Completed Fate*** (相合着方成济命丹砂).
**Knowing Black to guard Yin** (知白守其阴),
Is called the **River Vehicle** (名日是河车).
**Yin is Black** (阴者阴), **Yang is White** (阳以白).
From **Yin emerges Yang**, called **Lead** (从阴而所产阳，谓之铅).
**Lead** (铅者) **is Black Tin** (阴锡),
Refined by **Fire**, revealing **White Silver within** (用火而炼之，内有白银自现),
Thus it is said:
**"Knowing White to guard Black"** (知白守阴),
**Black is Water’s count of One** (阴水数一),
**White is Metal’s count of Two** (白者金二之数也).
**One produces Two**, called **Yin and Yang as Solar Essence and Lunar Luster** (得一方生二，谓之阴阳为日精、月华),
Named the **River Vehicle** (名日河车).
Thus the **classic says**:
*"The Northern Peak is called the River Vehicle"* (北方正熙号河车),
*"The Eastern Quarter produces *Golden Luster*"* (束方甲乙成金华).
This is it.

Within the **Central Palace**, the **Yellow Sprout** (丹田生黄芽) **emerges**.
But **Solar Essence and Lunar Luster** (日精月华),
Used **daily in the Four Seasons** (日用四时),
Circulated into the **Central Palace** (而运转入於中官之内).
The **Central Palace** (中官者) **is the furnace-vessel** (谓之鼎器也).
**Solar Essence** (日精) **is Lead**, named the **River Vehicle** (名日河车).
**Lunar Luster** (月华) **is Mercury**, named **Golden Luster** (名日金华).
**Golden Luster** (金华者) **is Lead**, the **Yellow Luster** (黄华也).
The **Central Palace’s furnace** (中官鼎者) **is Earth** (谓之曰土也).
When **Lead and Mercury meet Earth** (铅汞见土),
The **Sprout is born**, called the **Yellow Sprout** (乃生其芽，谓之日黄芽是也).
When **the Five Grains’ impurities are exhausted** (谷阴消除尽),
**Pure Golden Luster naturally appears** (自现美金华).

For **those who cultivate the Dao** (几以修学之人),
Awakening to **Lead and Mercury** (悟其铅汞),
The **True Brilliance** (下田真熙) **emerges within**.
But **close the breath** (但自闭息),
**Nurture the Spirit and Brilliance** (存神养熙),
Counting **a thousand breaths** (息闭千数),
The **Five Grains’ impurities vanish** (五谷死阴自除),
One **neither hungers nor thirsts** (人乃不饥不渴),
**Breath suspended, Spirit preserved** (息住神存),
The **True Brilliance grows daily** (真熙而日日自生),
Cultivators **naturally lighten their bodies** (学人自然身轻体健),
Their **strength doubles that of mortals** (力与常人加倍),
Moving **like clouds racing, rain rushing** (行如云奔雨骤).
When **hungry, they feast on Primordial Brilliance** (饥赛元和之熙),
When **thirsty, they drink Jade-Liquid Nectar** (渴饮玉液之浆).
Within the **Pool of Luster** (华池之内),
There is **constant fragrance like chrysanthemums** (常似菊华之香),
This is the **True Harmony of Heaven and Earth’s Golden Luster** (是天地之真和气美金华也).
The **Sea contains no impurities** (海中无秽质),
The **Three Worms gradually depart** (三虫渐渐赊).
The **Sea** (海者) **is the Stomach**, named the **Sea of Water and Grains** (名日水谷海).
It holds the **dregs of the Five Grains** (其中盛於五谷之租滓),
Called **impurities** (此名秽质).
For **those who cultivate the Dao** (几修学人),
Exploring **Lead and Mercury’s refinement** (探铅汞炼),
May reach **a thousand days** (可及千朝),
Closing the breath to **nurture Brilliance** (闭息养熙),
Counting **a thousand breaths** (数至千息),
The **impurities of the Five Grains naturally vanish** (谷阴自然而除),
The **ancestral dregs retreat completely** (祖滓退尽).
At **thirty days**, the **Upper Worm (Pengju)** (上虫名彭居),
In the **Dan Field, self-dissolves in sixty days** (在丹田自以销亡六十日),
The cultivator’s **complexion glows, aging reversed** (学人颜貌光泽，返老还童).
**Its dissolution** (亡) **removes hunger and thirst, softens the skin** (令人不饥不渴肌香).
At **ninety days**, the **Middle Worm (Pengzhi)** (中虫彭质) **is consumed** (以消亡),
Removing **all ailments** (令人无疾),
In the **Dan Field, the body lightens** (在丹田自以销),
The **Lower Worm (Pengyao)** (下虫彭矫) **in the Dan Field reverses aging** (在丹田自返老还童).
When **the flesh is supple and the Three Worms die** (肉润三虫死),
One becomes an **Earth-Walking Immortal** (身作地行之仙),
**A crane dances at the crown**, **clouds form at the feet** (顶中鹤舞，足下生云),
Called the **True Person**, aided by the **Three Yang True Spirits** (号日真人，三阳真神助也).
The **form transcends metal-bones** (形超於金骨),
And **accompanies the Floating Official** (将身伴浮查).
For **those who refine Lead and Mercury** (几修道人之志炼铅汞),
Using the **Four Seasons daily** (日用四时),
Circulating through the **Three Palaces** (运转三官),
May reach **a hundred days to complete the Golden Elixir** (可及百日金丹而成).
Closing the breath to **nurture impurities** (闭息养阴),
Counting **ten thousand breaths** (如数至万),
The **bones transmute into gold** (换骨成金骨),
The **form becomes like ice** (形超如冰),
The **skin fragrant, flesh luscious** (肌香肉腻),
**Water cannot wet them**, **fire cannot burn them** (入水不濡，匿火不焼),
Entering the **Five Phases’ illusions** (自入五假之中),
To **depart and ride the void** (要去而乘空便往),
**Will arrives where the feet tread in mist** (意到去处足雾而至矣).
This is **accompanying the Floating Official** (谓伴浮查).
The **Floating Official** (浮查者) **is the Immortal of the Five Phases** (五假之仙是也).

**Chapter Ten: Great and Small Counts**
From **One to Ten** (从一至十),
Allocated by **years and months** (分配年月).

From **One to a hundred**, from **a hundred to a thousand**, from **a thousand to ten thousand**,
Ten thousand generates **ten thousand** (亿),
Ten thousand thousand becomes **a hundred million** (兆),
A hundred million turns to **a myriad myriad** (垓),
This is the **Great and Small Counts** (增之大小数).

The **Small Count** (小者) is **twelve hours in a day** (一日十二时),
Six hours as **yang** (阳), from **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳);
Six hours as **yin** (阴), from **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥),
A day and a night, this is called the **Zi-Wu Method** (子午法).

**Zi** (子) before is **nurturing yin** (生阴),
**Wu** (午) after is **killing yang** (死阳),
Not to be practiced.

From **Zi** (子) after to **Wu** (午) before,
This is called **nurturing yang** (生阳),
Where one may apply effort.

Thus the verse says:
*"From **Zi** after to **Wu** before, one must strive with intent to refine,
Exit and enter as one’s will dictates,
**Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳) must be pondered carefully—this is the treasure."*

From **Zi** after to **Wu** before,
This is the **refinement of Jade Fluid and Golden Essence** (运用玉液金精) to produce **Immortal Elixir** (仙药),
The **count of yang predominance and yin receding** (阳大阴小之数).

At **Yin** (寅) and **You** (酉) open the furnace and bathe,
**Three *cǐ* (参) and two *liǎng* (两) divided evenly**—**stop.

For **ninety-nine times** (九九) at **Yin** (寅) and **You** (酉),
And **twenty-eight days** (二八日),
One must not practice nor dwell in the fire,
Only use them for bathing.

At **Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥) kindle the fire.
Each hour use **one *cǐ* of fire** (一铢),
**Three *cǐ* and seven *hū* (忽)**—**seven *sī* (丝) and seven *miǎo* (杪),
Do not let the fire be hasty,
It must be **gradually added** (慢慢加火之数).

Fire (火者) **is the method of closing breath to nurture the void** (闭息养无),
A practice within the **Dao of the spirit** (在神之数).

From **nine** (九), **gradually increase** (而添),
Until reaching **ten thousand** (至万数),
The **Golden Elixir** (金丹) will naturally be forged,
When its **baby form** (婴儿) is seen,
This is called **"Ten-Month Pregnancy of Mother and Child"** (十月怀胎子母分),
The **Elixir’s completion** (丹之成).

Wrap **silver** (银) around **gold** (金) to form the **outer casing** (裹),
Merge the **spirit’s chamber** (神室) with the **embryonic form** (子形).

Silver (银表者) **is lead** (铅),
Gold (金裹者) **is mercury** (汞).
Lead (铅) is **yang** (阳),
Mercury (汞) is **yin** (阴).
Yang (阳) is the **outer casing** (表),
Yin (阴) is the **inner core** (裹).

**Dragon’s retreat and Tiger’s concealment** (龙伏虎),
Fluid wrapped, Essence contained,
This is called **Day Soul and Moon Spirit** (日魂月魄),
**Day Essence and Moon Radiance** (日精月华),
**Yin Brother and Yang Sister** (婴兄诧女),
**Jade Night and Golden Fluid** (玉夜金津),
Hence the saying: **"Six yang lines, six yin lines"** (六阳爻六阴爻).

Their mutual regulation is called the **spirit’s chamber** (神室),
Yin and yang **vigorously unite** (熙相结),
Like the **cock’s crow at dawn** (鸡卯),
This is called the **embryonic form of yellow and white** (合子形黄白).

Place it in the **Central Palace’s cauldron** (中宫鼎),
Then use the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) to proceed.
The **Central Palace** (中官) is the **Dan Tian** (丹田),
Called the **cauldron vessel** (鼎器).

Yin and yang **vigor** (二熙),
Refined and drawn into the **Central Palace** (中官),
Obtaining **earth** (土) allows them to merge and regulate as one.

**Green, yellow, and white** (青黄白) are its **Elixir** (丹),
Called the **mandate** (命).

The **trigram patterns** (卦体者) are **stages of practice** (功程之侯),
Also the **yin and yang weights and trigrams’ lines** (阴阳斤两、卦象爻数),
The **union of yin and yang essences** (阴精阳精合成).

Discourse on the **Trigram Patterns** (卦体章第十):
**Qian generates Kan** (乾生於坎) is **Golden Essence** (金精).
**Qian** (乾) is **Heaven** (天), belonging to **Metal** (金), corresponding to **West-North** (位应西北).
On the **fifteenth day** (十五日), **returning light faces *Gēng* (庚) at *Shēn* (申)**—**
One **water** (水) unites with **Green Vigor** (青熙).

**Kan produces *Gèn* (艮)**—**the **name of mountains and stones** (山石名).
**Kan generates water** (坎生水),
This is **yin containing yang** (阴中有阳),
From **Metal** (金) generating **Kan** (坎).
On the **fifteenth day** (十五日),
**Yin-Month’s White Essence** (阴月白精) and **water** (水) are produced in **Kan** (坎),
The **trigram named Mountain-Stone** (卦名山石).

Bound in the **North position** (在位束北),
This is called **Day Essence** (日生).
On the **twenty-eighth day** (二十八日),
The **lowering *xián* (弦) form**—**Wood** (木),
**Water-Mountain-Stone** (水山石) produces **Zhèn** (震) **— Wood** (木).
The **trigram named Thunder** (卦名雷),
Corresponding to the **Mao position** (应之卯位),
Comprising **a hundred *kè* (刻), twenty *fēn* (分), and forty *miǎo* (杪)**,
Also **seventy-two degrees** (七十二度),
Symbolizing **one year’s ten-month count** (象一年十月之数).
Hence, it is called **"Ten Years"** (十年),
Thus it is called the **Small Count** (故谓之小也).

The **Great Count** (大者) is **twelve months** (十二月).
Six months as **yang** (阳): **eleventh to fourth month** (十一月至四月),
From **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳).
Six months as **yin** (阴): **fifth to tenth month** (五月至十月),
From **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥).
This is the **count of twelve months in a year** (一年十二个月之数),
Thus it is called the **Great Count** (故谓之大也).
This is the **stage of the year’s monthly count** (此是一年之月数之程),
The **true monthly count** (是实数月).

**Day and hour counts** (日时运) are **numbers** (为数),
But they measure **yin and yang conditions** (但度阴阳情).
**Day** (日者) is **aligned with hour** (与时同光).

For those who **practice and refine life and mandate** (几修学养性炼命),
One may use the **Four Seasons** (四时).
The **Four Seasons** (四时), the **Four *Mèng* (孟)**—**
**Establishing Spring** (立春), **Establishing Summer** (立夏), **Establishing Autumn** (立秋), **Establishing Winter** (立冬),
Called the **Four *Mèng* (孟)**—**
**First month’s *Mèng* Spring** (正月孟春), **Fourth month’s *Mèng* Summer** (四月孟夏), **Seventh month’s *Mèng* Autumn** (七月孟秋),
And **Tenth month’s *Mèng* Winter** (十月孟冬), as recorded in *Sān Tóng Qì* (参同契).

These are the **beginnings of the four seasons** (此为四季之首).
**Hours** (时) use **Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥),
This is called **"Day’s Seven Returns and Nine Reversions"** (日七返九还).
**Yin** (寅) is **Wood** (木),
**Si** (巳) is **Fire** (火),
**Shen** (申) is **Metal** (金),
**Hai** (亥) is **Water** (水),
These are the **four images** (四象) contained in the **Central Palace** (纳於中官),
Forming the **Five Phases** (为之五行),
Thus it is called **"Nine Reversions"** (故谓日九还).

**Yin** (寅) as **Metal** (金),
**Si** (巳) as **Water** (水),
**Shen** (申) as **Wood** (木),
**Hai** (亥) as **Fire** (火),
Contained in the **Central Palace** (纳於中官),
**Reversed and paired with *Kàn* (坎) and *Lí* (离)**,
Thus it is called **"Seven Returns"** (故日七返).

Hence the scripture says:
*"The **Lí Palace** (离官) holds the **true water** (真水) within its symbol,
The **Kàn door** (坎户) contains the **hidden true metal** (隐正金)."*

This is called **"Seven Returns and Nine Reversions"** (故谓之九还七返),
The **yin and yang conditions** (是阴阳之情).

For those who **practice and attain this principle** (几修养悟此理),
This is the **true, unobstructed wondrous Dao** (是真正妙道无碍).

**Six Harmonies and the Breaking of Oppositions** (六合与冲破),
Spiritual mechanisms **mutually wrapped** (互包) to form.

**Zi-Chou** (子丑), **Yin-Hai** (寅亥), **Si-Shen** (巳申), **Wu-Wei** (午未), **Xū-Mao** (戌卯), **You-Chen** (酉辰),
These are the **Six Harmonies** (六合).

**Zi-Wu** (子午), **Mao-You** (卯酉), **Si-Hai** (巳亥), **Yin-Shen** (寅申), **Chen-Xū** (辰戌),
These are the **Breaking of Oppositions** (冲破).

When the **Six Harmonies** (六合) all **turn and transform** (运转),
The **Breaking of Oppositions** (冲破) is used for practice,
This is the **spiritual mechanisms mutually wrapped** (神机互包成象).

The **Great Count** (大) and **Small Count** (小) are **yin and yang principles** (阴阳情理),
But depend on this **refinement without deviation** (但依此铃无差互).

The **Great Count** (大) requires **nine years of practice** (九载),
The **Small Count** (小) is **a hundred days** (百日).

This sentence is explained by the previous one.
The **Great Count** (大) is **nine years, twenty-seven months** (九年二十七),
The **Small Count** (小) is **three months** (方三月) **—** the **Great Count’s completion** (大功毕).

The **Small Count** (小) is the **one-hundred-day closed-breath practice** (百日闭息功程),
Where one may immediately achieve **Golden Elixir** (金丹),
Exceeding the **nine-year Great Count** (九载之功).

This is called **"Nine Years, One Hundred Days"** (此谓九载，百日之名数).
**Nine years** (九载) is difficult to achieve,
But **one hundred days** (百日) can be completed immediately.

**Yin** (寅) and **Shen** (申) together with **Si** (巳) and **Hai** (亥),
**Zi-Wu** (子午) **refines Golden Essence** (转金精).

**Yin** (寅), **Shen** (申), **Si** (巳), and **Hai** (亥),
These are called the **Four Seasons** (四时).
**Practice with the Day’s Zi-Wu** (日用功行子午名),
**Reversed *Bàn* (般) *Zǐ* (载) from the *Wěi* (尾) *Xiàn* (闲) hole,
**Returning upward to *Ní* (泥) *Jiǔ* (九)**—**
**Sequentially turning to return to the Dan Tian** (顺转归於丹田中),
**Revealing true nature** (见真性),
**Gold crystals transform into Golden Elixir** (金晶变转成金丹).

「The **Yīn** (令) **Sheng** (生) phase—**two-day** (二日) **xiàng** (象)—
Is the **grandson of Gold** (金之孙) and the **child of Water** (水之子).
Emerging from **Shān** (山), it is called **two yīn, one yáng** (二阴一阳).
When the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other and generate,
It becomes the **body of Wind** (风体), **Wood** (木), the **Spring Vitality** (春中日魂).
It is also called the **Dragon of the Sun and Moon** (日月精名日龙),
The **ninefold number** (《周易》九之数) of the *Chóng* (弦) and *Wàng* (望).

**Xùn** (巽) is **Wind** (风),
Generating the **body of Wood** (体木) and forming the trigrams.
As **Xùn** (巽), its name is the **Wind Trigram** (卦名日风),
And its position corresponds to **束** (束) **Nán** (南) [the southeast].
Thus, the **daughter of Kǎn** (坎) [Water] generates within **Wood** (木).
In **Spring** (春), it can generate,
As all things sprout and bud,
And the **gentle wind** (和风) melts the frost—
This is called **two yáng, one yīn** (二阳一阴).
With **yáng** above and **yīn** below,
In **three days** (三日) it becomes **perfected** (成华).

**Lí** (离) is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀) hidden in **Earth** (土).
**Lí** (离) belongs to **Fire** (火),
Called **yīn within yáng** (阳中阴),
Generated from **Zhèn** (震) [Thunder],
Formed by **Wind** (风) into its trigram structure.
It is said that **cinnabar** (朱砂) contains **quicksilver** (水银),
Positioned at **Wǔ** (午) [south],
Belonging to **yīn** (阴).
Hidden in **Earth** (土) #3—
This means there is the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram in the **southwest** (西南),
And in **sixty days** (六十日) it forms **purple essence** (紫精),
Where **yīn** and **yáng** are beyond measure.

**Duì** (兑) emerges from the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] palace,
Naturally harmonizing with **emotion** (情).
**Duì** (兑) corresponds to the **west** (西方) at **yǒu** (酉) [west],
Generated from **Kūn** (坤) [Earth],
And its season aligns with the **eighth month** (八月).
When the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other,
The **moon** (月) grows—
After **four and seven** (四七) [the 14th day],
It begins to wane, becoming **two yīn, one yáng** (二阴一阳).
With **yīn** above and **yáng** below,
In **ninety days** (九十日) it forms **purple gold sand** (紫金砂).
**Gold sand** (金砂) is **purple crystal** (紫晶),
Which is also called **essence** (精).

After **Zǐ** (子) [north], the **Fù** (复) line becomes the **initial trigram** (初卦),
And **Yīn** (寅) **Shēn** (申) [west] **Tài** (泰) [Peace] **sevenfold return** (七返灵).
**Zǐ** (子) corresponds to the **eleventh month** (十一月),
And the **sun** (日) aligns with **Zǐ** (子) [midnight],
Where **one yáng** (一阳) initially generates,
Operating beneath **five yīn** (五阴) in its **functioning** (功程),
Called the **Earth-Thunder *Fù* Trigram** (地雷《复》卦).
**Five yīn** (五阴) battle **one yáng** (一阳),
Known as **"Dragon in the Field"** (见龙在田).
Returning to **Yīn** (寅) [east], it becomes the **Earth-Heaven *Tài* Trigram** (地天《泰》卦),
Called **"Mutual Prosperity of Three Yīn, Three Yáng"** (交泰三阴三阳).
Returning again to **Shēn** (申) [west], it becomes the **Heaven-Earth *Pǐ* Trigram** (天地《否》卦),
Also **"Mutual Prosperity"** (交泰),
Corresponding to **autumn’s three yáng, three yīn** (秋三阳三阴),
Known as **sevenfold return** (七返),
Explaining the **returning interplay** (相返) of the *Pǐ* (否) and *Tài* (泰) trigrams.

After **Wǔ** (午) [south], the **Gòu** (遘) position arrives in correspondence,
And **Sì** (巳) **Hài** (亥) [west] **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] **ninefold return** (九还成).
**Wǔ** (午) corresponds to the **fifth month** (五月),
And the **sun** (日) aligns with **Wǔ** (午) [noon],
Where **one yīn** (一阴) initially generates,
After the **five yáng** (五阳) have completed their **functioning** (功程),
Called the **Heaven-Wind *Gòu* Trigram** (天风《遘》).
**Five yáng** (五阳) battle **one yīn** (一阴),
Known as **"Six in the First Position: Treading Dew, Firm Ice Approaches"** (初六履霜坚冰至).

**Sì** (巳) corresponds to the **fourth month** (四月),
And the **sun** (日) aligns with **Sì** (巳) [morning],
Called the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] trigram’s **structure** (体),
With **six yáng** (六阳) lines fully present,
**Yáng** (阳) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢) [12.6 grams].

**Hài** (亥) corresponds to the **tenth month** (十月),
And the **sun** (日) aligns with **Hài** (亥) [night],
Called the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram’s **structure** (体),
With **six yīn** (六阴) lines fully present #4,
**Yīn** (阴) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢) [12.6 grams].

**Yáng** (阳) is **silver** (银) at **half a jīn** (半斤) [8 oz],
And **yīn** (阴) is **gold** (金) at **half a jīn** (半斤) [8 oz].
When **gold** (金) and **silver** (银) combine,
Their total weight is **three hundred eighty-four zhu** (铢),
Called **sixteen liǎng** (两) [16 oz],
Which is **one jīn** (一斤) [1 lb] in measure.
This is the **Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir** (金丹大药),
The **ninefold return of the Golden Elixir** (九转还丹之名).
The **ninefold return** (日九还) corresponds to **nine colors** (九色).
When the **nine colors** (九色) appear,
**Chóng** (弦) and **Wàng** (望) naturally complete their formation.

**Gèn** (艮) [Mountain] invests the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram,
**Yáng** (阳) [Heaven] fully observed,
Employing the **yīn-yáng nine-month process** (运用阴阳九月程).
**Gèn** (艮) is **Mountain** (山),
Positioned at **束** (束) **Běi** (北) [northeast],
With **one yáng, two yīn** (一阳二阴).
**Kūn** (坤) is **Earth** (地),
Positioned at **xīnán** (西南) [southwest],
With **three yīn** (三阴).

When **Gèn** (艮) [Mountain] invests **Kūn** (坤) [Earth],
The trigram is named **Mountain-Earth *Bō* Trigram** (山地《剥》),
Corresponding to the **ninth month** (九月),
Where **one yáng** (一阳) battles **five yīn** (五阴).
By the **tenth month** (十月), **Hài** (亥) [west] is established,
**Yīn** (阴) is exhausted, **yáng** (阳) is spent,
And the **Kūn** (坤) [Earth] trigram is revealed.
**Kūn** (坤) is where **true Earth** (真土) and its **wondrous applications** (妙用) are seen—
This is called **"Earth of the Sun"** (日土).

**Duì** (兑) enters the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] palace,
**Yīn** (阴) nearly vanishing,
The trigram divides at the **seasonal nodes** (节令),
And the **ninth month’s threefold process** (九三经) is complete.
**Duì** (兑) corresponds to the **west** (正西) at **yǒu** (酉) [west],
And **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] corresponds to the **northwest** (西北) position.

Where **yīn** (阴) nearly vanishes.
By the **fourth month** (四月), **Sì** (巳) [east] is established,
And the **Qián** (乾) [Heaven] trigram is perfected.
This is called the **ninefold return** (九还).

Thus, the **Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir** (金丹大药) becomes a **treasure** (成宝),
Known as **purple gold sand** (号名紫金砂).

**Chóng** (弦) **Wàng** (望) **Chapter Twelve** (章第十二):
**Upper Chóng** (上弦) begins at the **new moon** (月初生) at **gēng** (庚) [west].
Every **three days** (几三日),
The **moon** (月) emerges from **gēng** (庚) [west],
Called **gold essence** (金精),
**Familiarity** (熙) initially generates,
**Yīn** (阴) lines emerge,
Weighing **twelve zhu** (铢),
Named **moon’s shadow** (月魄).

**Lower Wàng** (下弦) is the **moon’s decline** (月丧) at **jiǎ** (甲) [east].
Every **twenty-eighth day** (二十八日) of the **moon** (阳),
The **moon’s decline** (月丧) is revealed.
**Jiǎ** (甲) [east] is where **familiarity** (熙) initially generates,
**Yáng** (阳) lines emerge,
And **familiarity** (熙) harmonizes with it—**yáng** (阳).
**Silver** (银) is the **outer layer** (表),
The **envelope** (裹),
With **water and fire** (水火) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],
When the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other at **seven and eight** (七八) [times],
**Familiarity** (熙) is generated.

The **first fifteen days** (前十五日) and **last fifteen days** (后十五日),
Five days total—
**One hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢),
The **moon’s decline** (月丧) is at **jiǎ** (甲) [east],
Early **too heavy** (太重) #5—
**Twelve zhu** (铢) is named **sun’s vitality** (日魂) #6 #7.

**Harmonization** (合) of **yīn-yáng** (阴阳) **familiarity** (熙) totals **one liǎng** (一两) [16 grams],
Called the **measure of yīn-yáng** (阴阳之数).
This is **lead** (铅) generated from **Wood** (木) as **husband** (夫).
And **quicksilver** (汞) generated from **Metal** (金) as **wife** (妇).
When combined, they form the **four essences** (四象),
Totaling **sixteen liǎng** (十六两) [128 grams] of **Great Medicine** (大药).

When the **sun and moon** (日月) face each other at **seven and eight** (七八) [times],
The **sixteen yīn-yáng** (二八阴阳) lines are complete.
The **sun and moon** (日月) each reach **fifteen days** (十五日) in **illumination** (一望),
The **moon** (月) has **abundance** (盈)—
This is **two moons** (二月).
The **last fifteen days** (后十五日) are the **moon’s decline** (月).
It is said that **six yīn, six yáng** (六阴六阳) are fully present,
**Yáng** (阳) heavy at **one hundred ninety-two zhu** (铢),
Totaling **three hundred eighty-four zhu** (铢),
The **moon** (月) at **sixteen liǎng** (一十六两) [128 grams],
**Chóng** (弦) **silver** (银) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],
**Moon’s decline** (月) at **eight liǎng** (八) [64 grams],
Opposing **twenty-three days** (对二十三) **moon’s decline** (月) at **eight liǎng** (八与二十三),
And **fourth month’s jī** (四j') **Wood** (木) also.
**Wood essence** (木精),
**Yīn-yáng sun-moon** (阴阳日月) totaling **twenty-four zhu** (相计二十四铢),
The **sun** (日) has **abundance** (盈) **Wood** (木) for **measure** (为);
And **Metal** (金) is **reversed** (日有反).
The **first ten days** (前十) are **silver’s outer layer** (银表) and **gold’s envelope** (金裹).
**Gold and water** (金水) at **eight liǎng** (八两) [64 grams],
When the **sun and moon** (日月) meet,
The **moon** (月) has **deficiency** (亏),
Again **yīn** (阴) is heavy at **one** (一),
Calculating **one jīn** (一斤) [1 lb] in total.

The moon in its **ascending phase** (上弦) produces **eight liǎng** (八两) of **Metal** (金), its rising and setting both within the **Lí** (离) mansion.
When the moon rises and sets, it is said to be aligned together at the **true south** (正南) at **noon** (午地), belonging to **Fire** (火), corresponding to the **Lí** (离) hexagram—where the two ends are **yáng** (阳), and the center is **yīn** (阴).
According to the *Zhōu Shū* (《周书》), it states: **"Lí’s center is void"** (#8).
This means **Fire** (火) contains **Water** (水), and every **eighth and twenty-third day** of the month, it is generated in the **Lí** mansion.
The **moon** is the **Metal’s radiance** (金之熙), and within **Lí** lies **true Water** (真水), which is the **child-mother** (子母) of **Metal** (金), hence its appearance and disappearance in the **Lí** mansion.

The **yīn-yáng** distribution of **Metal** (金) and **silver** (银) aligns with the **great elixir’s** (大药) harmonious correspondence.
**Yīn** refers to **Metal** (金),
**Yáng** refers to **silver** (银).
The **moon** is **Metal** (金), the **sun** is **silver** (银)—when **sun and moon** (日月) align, **silver** is the **outer layer** (表), **Metal** is the **envelope** (裹), and **mercury** (汞) with **lead** (铅) naturally coalesces into the **great elixir** (大药).
But one must **nurture the spirit** (存神) and **restrain the refining** (息炼) of the **golden elixir** (金丹).
**Nurturing the spirit** (存神) is the **radiance** (熙),
**Restraining** (息) is the **blood** (血).
**Black** is **Water** (水), **blood** is **Water** (水).
**Restraining** (息) has five aspects: as **Earth** (土), as **Metal** (金), as **Water** (水), as **Wood** (木), as **Fire** (火).
**Water** is **blood** (血), **blood** is **marrow** (髓), **marrow** is **essence** (精), and **essence** is then the **spirit** (神).
If one preserves **essence** (精), it becomes **jin** (津).
When **jin** (津) and **essence** (精) harmonize, life is sustained, years prolonged, and longevity increased.
The **Dan Tian** (丹田) contains **true radiance** (真熙), and soon one becomes a **true person** (真人).

After **nine transformations** (九转), the heavens and earth are renewed, and the **three worms** (三虫) are extinguished, granting **prosperity** (昌) to the body.
**Nine transformations** (九转) refer to the union of **essence** (精) and **jin** (津), where **lead** (铅) and **mercury** (汞) self-form.
**Lead** (铅) is **white externally, black internally**,
**Mercury** (汞) is **red externally, white within**.
When refined into **true lead** (真铅), the **red** turns **pale yellow** (徘),
**Lead** (铅) transforms into **yellow** (黄),
**Yellow lead** (黄铅) merges with **pale yellow, red, and green** to become **purple gold** (紫金), named **golden sand** (金砂).
This is the **great elixir’s** (大药) circulation within the **central mansion** (中官),
**Nine unifications into one** (九合归一), known as the **golden elixir** (金丹).
After abstaining from **five grains** (五谷), within a hundred days, the **three worms** (三虫) self-destruct,
Granting **bodily prosperity** (身昌) and **transcendent form** (形超),
**Golden bones** (金骨) and **luminous body** (体透光明),
**Silken hair** (绪发) and **youthful visage** (童颜),
Equal to the **immortals** (仙), naturally free from **cold, heat, or hunger**.

The **Three Pure Ones** (三清) bestow celestial decrees.
If one recognizes **lead** (铅) and **mercury** (汞),
Warmly refining them into the **golden elixir** (金丹),
And anchoring it within the **Three Officials** (三官),
Using the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) daily,
With **six-time circulation** (六时运转),
The **Heavenly Gate** (天关) does not open inward,
The **Earthly Gate** (地户) does not emit outward—
This is the **leak-proof field** (无漏之田).
When the **merit is complete** (功成) and the **practice fulfilled** (行满),
One’s name is recorded in the **Three Pure Ones’** (三清) celestial register.
After **eight hundred days** (八百), treasures spread across **three thousand** (三千),
Heavenly messengers in **scarlet robes** (朱衣) descend to welcome.

The Seven Treasures originate from **One Essence** (一**精**).
Divine symbols appear as white snow from **Jia-Yin** (甲庚).
The Seven Treasures refer to the **Seven Refining** (七返) name,
and arise from the **True Essence** within the **Dan Field** (丹田之中真**精**所生).

**Jia** is Wood, **Geng** is Metal—Metal and Wood mutually assail.
From **Yin to Shen** (寅至申) as **Geng**, measuring **Jia’s** return to bind and form the **Refinement**.
**Yin** is the **Jia’s** progenitor, **Shen** the **Geng’s** ancestor.
**Jia** is called **Day Essence** (日精), the **Essence of Wood** (木之**精**).
**Geng** is called **Moon Dew** (月华), the **Essence of Metal** (金之**精**).
Metal and Wood mutually assail—
Initially as **Divine Symbols of White Snow** (神符白雪),
when **Essence and Qi** (精津) merge,
within the **Crucible** like mother-of-pearl,
or like snow and ice—
called **Day Divine Symbols of White Snow Golden Elixir Great Return Elixir** (日神符白雪金液大还丹).
This is the **Supreme Refined Elixir of Spirit** (上品灵妙之丹).

**Bing-Ren** (丙壬) converge to form **Two Essences** (二**精**).
**Bing** is Fire, **Ren** is Water.
**Bing** belongs to the Heart, called **Li** (离).
**Ren** belongs to the Kidneys, called **Kan** (坎).
Fire and Water counteracting form **Completed** (既济).
**Kan** is Lead, **Li** is Mercury.
Mercury within **Kan-Lead** refines into **White Silver** (白银),
**Li-Mercury** returns to form **Red Boy** (朱儿).
The **Red Brother** and **White Lead** merge,
when burned, become **Two Essences’ Red Cinnabar Elixir** (二**精**赤丹砂).

Within **Jia**, **Horse-Tooth** (马牙) appears like **Laughing Birth** (似笑生).
Taking the **Two Essences’ Cinnabar Elixir** into the **Dan Field** to warm-refine,
it transforms into **White Horse-Tooth** (白马牙).
Like the tender sprout of **Luo** (劳),
or white shoots sprouting from grass,
rising from the earth—
called **White Horse-Tooth** (白马牙).

Metal and Wood reunite in the **Crucible**,
Water and Fire harmonize in the **Hero’s Pit** (雄坑).
Metal is Water, is Mercury—**Yin**.
Wood is Fire, is Lead—**Yang**.
Metal is **Essence** (精),
Wood is **Qi** (津).
The **Four Symbols** harmonized,
entered into the **Central Official** (中官)—
called the **Crucible** (鼎).
**Stillness and Closure of Essence** (定息闭**精**),
**Nurturing Spirit** within the **Central Crucible** (存神於中官鼎内).
The **Crucible** is Earth—
called the **Hero’s Pit** (雄坑).
Its medicine is named **Four Spirits** (四神),
also called **Four-Refining Soul Elixir** (四转灵丹).

When the **Five Phases** merge and transform,
**Jade Elixir and Cinnabar** refine through **Seven Turns**.
The **Five Phases** are Water, Wood, Fire, Metal, Earth.
Its medicine transforms into **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽),
then into **Jade Elixir and Cinnabar** (玉液丹砂)—
**Seventy-Two Days** equal **Seventy-Two Years** in duration.

**Yin-Shen** (寅申) focus intent on **Fire’s Timing** (火候),
but preserve **White Essence** to return **Metal Essence** (金精).
**Yin** is Wood, **Shen** is Metal.
Wood is **Yang**—Lead and Mercury merge.
At **Yin Hour** and **Shen Hour**,
**Si Hour** and **Hai Hour**, apply the **Work**—
called **Destruction-Refinement, Diligent Fire Timing** (毁炼勤行火候),
**Nurturing Metal Essence** to extend years and life.

**Day-Month, Four Seasons, and Eight Trigrams**—
the **Great Elixir** transforms into **Childhood**.
**Day Use**: One day equals one year.
**Month Use**: The Four Seasons—**Yin, Shen, Si, Hai**.
**Yin** is **Early Spring** (孟春), **Hai** is **Early Winter** (孟冬),
**Shen** is **Early Autumn** (孟秋), **Si** is **Early Summer** (孟夏)—
these are the Four Seasons, mirroring a year’s count.
The **Eight Trigrams** are:
*Kàn* (乾), *Kūn* (坤), *Lí* (离), *Kàn* (坎), *Pǐ* (否), *Tài* (泰), *Fù* (复), *Gòu* (遘).
This is the **Application of the Eight Trigrams**.

**One Hundred Twenty Days** complete the **Great Elixir’s** count—
**One Thousand Two Hundred Years**, the **Three Worms** die,
**Grain Essence** (谷**精**) exhausted,
the **Five Viscera’s True Essence** self-formed—
forever abandoning tastes,
neither drinking nor thirsting,
returning to childhood, body light and ears keen,
moving like flying—
walking as clouds race, rain rushes—
strength doubled, becoming **Immortal**.

**Chapter on Nine Refining** (九转章第十四)
The **Nine-Refining Soul Elixir** is called **Gold** (金).
The **Daoist Classic’s** profound meaning is deep.
To recognize the **True Great Medicine** within the body,
one must rely on **Yin-Yang Two Essences** (阴阳二**精**) to complete it.
Called **Purple-Gold Cinnabar** (紫金丹砂),
though **Daoist Scriptures** number ten thousand volumes,
and **Master’s Writings** ten thousand chapters,
all speak of **Lead and Mercury**.
Students who do not grasp the principles
instead take **Essence and Tin**, **Water Silver** (水银),
and burn them in **Crucibles**—
yet none attain it.

Those who awaken to its principles know:
the **Great Medicine** never leaves the body—
the body itself contains it.
This is the **Purple-Gold Elixir** (紫金丹).
If one grain is refined,
it extends life for **Ten Thousand Years**—
ghosts and spirits fear it.

Few students awaken to **Lead and Mercury’s** principles,
recognizing **Yin-Yang’s** roots,
destroying and refining into **Elixir** to extend years,
adding **Ten Thousand**—all diseases vanish,
the **Three Worms** annihilated,
spirits and demons tremble upon seeing it.

Dispersed as **Thousands of Flowing Pearls** (流珠),
when gathered, they become **True Person** (真人).
When **Lead and Mercury** are refined into **Pearls** (珠),
also called **Relics** (舍利), **Immortal’s Flowing Pearls** (仙人日流珠).
This is the **Seven Treasures** gathered—
**Yin-Yang Two Essences** merging into **One Grain**,
**True Gold** the size of a **Square Inch** (方寸),
weighing **One Catty** (一斤), **Sixteen Two-Ounces** (十六两).
**Yin** weighs **One Hundred Ninety-Two Mín** (一百九十二铢),
**Yang** weighs **One Hundred Ninety-Two Mín**—
this is **Metal and Wood**.
Wood is **Mercury**, Metal is **Lead**.
Mercury is the **Tiger**, Lead is the **Dragon**.
The **Dragon and Tiger** subdue each other,
self-forming the **True Medicine of Immortal**.

**Yin-Yang Lines** harmoniously converge,
the **Mechanism of Creation** naturally unites.
**Yin** is the **Kūn Trigram** (坤卦), **Yang** is the **Kàn Trigram** (乾卦).
**Kūn** is Earth, **Kàn** is Heaven.
**Heavenly Essence** descends, **Earthly Essence** ascends.
Through **Yin-Yang** mutual sensation and harmony,
called **Creation** (造化)—
named **Divine Communication** (神通),
also called **Unfathomable Creation Divine Communication** (造化神通难测量).

**Chapter on Eliminating the Three Worms** (除三虫章第#3十五)
The **Three Worms** later have names.
The **Three Worms** are the **Three Corpses** (三尸).
The **Upper Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Jū** (居),
dwells in the **Upper Dan Field** (上丹田).
The **Middle Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Zhì** (质),
dwells in the **Middle Dan Field** (中丹田).
The **Lower Worm**, surname **Peng**, named **Jiǎo** (矫),
dwells in the **Lower Dan Field** (下丹田).
Within the body, they are the **Three Souls** (三魂),
also called the **Three Corpses**.
They crave **alcohol, meat, and fighting**,
**greed for wealth and lust**—
causing early death in humans.

**Chapter on Eliminating the Three Worms (续)**
The **Upper Corpse** delights in food, wine, meat, joy, and anger.
The **Middle Corpse** covets wealth and fights.
The **Lower Corpse** lusts for beauty, favoring death over life.
Each **Reginal Day (庚申)**, it ascends to the **Upper Realm** to report to the **Lord of Fate (司命)**, denouncing a person’s sins, never their virtues—seeking early death and feasting on their blood and marrow.
Thus, the practitioner must first eliminate the **Three Worms** to avoid suffering.

This arises from **intent (志)**—a subtle **Dao** difficult to master.
If one encounters a **virtuous and enlightened scholar (志贤达士)**, seeking profound principles for cultivation, they may attain it.
But if one is **unworthy (负志)**, Heaven will punish them.

When the **Three Worms** are eradicated, lifespan extends.
When **grains are abandoned**, the worms perish of themselves.
Humans must first observe the **Reginal Day (庚申)**, eliminating the **Three Worms**, then refine **jing-essence (精津)** into the **Great Elixir (大药)**.
**Lead and Mercury** restrain each other—**Dragon and Tiger** do not ascend;
they subdue the **Five Zang Organs**, forming **True Essence (真精)**,
while the **Lower Source (下元)** generates **Surge and Harmony (冲和之精)**.

Hold the breath to **one hundred twenty breaths**,
gradually eliminating the **grains-worms (谷虫)**.
At **thirty days**, the **Upper Worm** dies.
At **sixty days**, the **Middle Worm** dies.
At **ninety days**, the **Lower Worm** perishes.
Once the **Three Worms** are gone, longevity and vitality endure—
eternal freedom from hunger and thirst.
**Nurture the Golden Essence (金精)** without concern.

When humans abandon grains and despise flavors,
the **Golden Essence** remains undiminished—
this is the **Great Elixir’s foundation**,
the **ancestral scripture of human vitality**:
*"Life is the root of death; death is the root of life."*

Few recognize the **two roots of life and death**.
One who can **die to live and live to die**—
when **Lead and Mercury** form the Elixir, they revive the living.
If one strays from the **Five Phases**, they fail to grasp the **Mystic Principle** and cannot eliminate [the worms].

This is the **Golden Essence** transforming into the **Great Elixir**.
The **Golden Essence** is **Mercury (汞)**;
the **Jade Nectar** is **Lead (铅)**.
**Mercury** is **Metal (金)**;
**Lead** is **Wood (木)**.
Wood is **Yang**; Metal is **Yin**—
**Green and White** converge in the **Dan Fields**.
The **Central** is **Earth (土)**, **Yellow**—
called the **Green, Yellow, White Elixir**.
When gathered, it forms the **Purple-Gold Elixir (紫金丹)** in the **inch-square cavity**;
when dispersed, it flows as **pearls**—**jewel treasures**.

**Three Fields’ daily refinement**—
ninety days of practice—
the **Three Worms** die, grains are abandoned,
and breath may be held to **a thousand breaths**,
walking underwater without drowning.
The **Three Officials’** realm holds **sun-moon refinement**,
the body becomes transparent and luminous,
free from worldly thoughts—
**True Essence** flows naturally.

**Chapter on the Nine Domains (九域章第十六)**
The **Nine Domains** must be known by their **incantations**,
transforming **God-Essence (神精)** into **marrow and blood**.
The **Nine Domains** are the **mirror of the Nine Circulations (九运)**,
also called the **Nine Transformations’ gateway (九转之门户)**.
They are named:
**1. Grain Spirit (谷神)**,
**2. Dry Pass (乾关)**,
**3. Hua Pool Gate (华池户)**,
**4. Flying Gate (飞门)**,
**5. Soul Window (魂窗)**,
**6. Heavenly Gate (天户)**,
**7. Sea Leak (海漏)**,
**8. Xi-Yi Gate (希夷门)**,
**9. Day Domain (日域)**—
called the **Nine Domains**, bearing the **Nine Circulations’ hues**.

All enter through these gates.
The practitioner, mastering the **incantation**, closes the breath to nurture **essence (精)**—
closing the breath permeates the body.
**Essence and blood** chase each other into the bones,
transforming into **marrow**.
When marrow is full, lifespan extends—
**immortality without death**.

**Supplementing essence and marrow strengthens sinews and skin**—
at night, **white milk** flows through the body,
**essence transforms into blood**, blood into **essence**.
When **essence is not lost**, it supplements **marrow**,
circulating into the **Nine Caverns (泥丸)** as **brain marrow**.
The flesh becomes moist, the skin white as jade, smooth and luminous—
**sinew strength** surpasses mortals a hundredfold.
After **a hundred days**, **True Essence** flows freely,
**white milk** circulates everywhere—
no **red blood** remains—
this is the **Pivotal Immortal’s rank (膀仙位)**,
dwelling long in the world as a **True Person (真人)**.
This is called the **Earth Immortal (地仙)**.

When the **Three Worms** perish, the **Dao flourishes**,
**True Essence** flows endlessly.
With the **Three Worms** dead, the body thrives—
**grains-worms** vanish, the **Five Zang Organs** fill,
**True Essence** circulates through the body,
breath sustains itself.
One may hold it to **ten thousand breaths**,
enter water unsoaked, enter fire unburned—
this is the **Day Immortal (日仙)**.

**Heavenly Pass is sealed, Earthly Gate is closed**,
**Central Official’s infant** embraces **sun and moon**.
The **Heavenly Pass** sealed—
**upper and lower** cannot taste flavors,
**grains-worms** are unattainable,
breath is held naturally.
The **Earthly Gate** is firm—
**nothing leaks below**; both gates are closed.
The **Central Official** is the **Dan Field**,
named the **Crucible (鼎器)**.
When **Lead and Mercury** enter the **Crucible**,
it is called **True Essence**.
The **infant embracing sun and moon**—
this is the **orthodox essence of Yin and Yang**.

A **hundred years** of refinement produces a **True Person**,
**Three Pure Ones** add the name—**Jade Emperor rejoices**.
**A hundred years** means **a hundred days** of completion.
Each day has **twelve periods**—
six **Yang**, six **Yin**—
also called **Meng (孟)** of **Tiger, Monkey, Dragon, Rabbit**—
the **Four Seasons**—
refining the **Golden Elixir** into a **True Person**.
When the deed is done, ascending to the **Upper Realm**,
the **Three Corpses** are eliminated.
The **Three Pure Ones** observe this person’s **glowing aura (霞精)**,
their name is added to the **Celestial Register**—
the **Jade Emperor’s face brightens**.

---
**Chapter on the Infant and Virgin (婴儿媒女章第十七)**
Within the **Three Palaces**, the **Infant** appears.
The **Three Officials** are the **Three Dan Fields**.
The **Infant** is the **Three Primordial Essences (三元正精)**,
also called **Lead (铅)**—
or the **orthodox essence of Wood (木之正精)**, named **Wood Essence (木精)**.

Before the **Bright Hall (明堂)** is a **Jade Pool**.
The **Bright Hall** is the **lock-key (索钥)**,
also called the **Sea of Essence (精海)**—
named the **Bright Hall**, or the **Chamber (洞房)**.

**Yellow Grandmother** unites the **Virgin**.
The **Virgin** is **Mercury (汞)**,
also called the **essence of Metal (金之精)**, named **Moon’s Luster (月华)**.
**Yellow Grandmother** is **Earth**, named the **Crucible (鼎)**—
the **essence of the Central Palace (中官之精)**.
When **Lead and Mercury** meet **Earth**, they merge as one.
**Two-one returns to the Crucible**—
**Elixir** is formed and harmonized,
united within the Earth, never separating.

The **Infant** is **Lead**,
the **Virgin** is **Mercury**—
**Lead and Mercury** unite,
**Lead** is **Metal** encased in **Wood**.

The **True Yang and True Yin** are embraced by the **Central Palace**,
within the **Crucible** merging into one.
This is the **unity without separation**—
the **root ancestor of the Great Elixir**.

At **dawn and dusk**, observe the **Pearls of Sun and Moon**,
each night accompanied into the **Emerald Canopy**.
**Dawn** is the **White Day**,
**Dusk** is the **Night**.
**Observing** means **qi condensing into pearls**—
called **Flowing Pearls**.
**Sun and Moon** are the **true essences of Metal and Wood**.
Within the **Dan Field**, there are **Sun and Moon** apart—
**Sun** is the **essence of Yang**, **Moon** the **essence of Yin**,
called the **Souls and Spirits of Sun and Moon**.
Each night, they enter the **Emerald Canopy**—
this is called **Metal and Wood restraining each other**.
The **Emerald Canopy** is named for the **Great Elixir’s dual-essence Golden Elixir** when formed.
When the **True Embryo** is perfected and refined,
the **True Nurturer** achieves **Embryo Liberation**—
**refining and binding** is the **root ancestor of the Great Elixir** taking form.
**Yellow Sprouts and White Snow** emerge—
this is the **silken binding**.
The **True Cultivator**, when the **Dan Field’s true essence solidifies**,
transforms countenance, reversing aging to youth—
this is called **Embryo Liberation**.

The **ten-month term** is the fixed cycle;
**twenty-four essences** are arranged in order.
Yet through human cultivation, **three hundred days in ten months** forge the **Great Elixir**.
There are **sixty days** for **Mao and You**—
the **eight and two** facing each other,
the **number of annual bathings**; within twelve months,
excluding the **second and eighth months**, only ten months are used.
When the **Great Elixir** is complete,
**twenty-four names correspond to the twenty-four essences**—
the **full year’s nodes**.

A **Son-Infant** is born at the **Crown’s Gate**.
The **Scholar-Cultivator**, through **Dan Field essence refinement**,
refines the **Golden Elixir**.
When **True Yin and Yang essences** unite,
each **visualization and storage** sees the **true essence** emerge at the **Crown’s Gate**—
this is the **Elder Brother-Infant**, called the **True Person wandering the Crown**.

---
**Eighteenth Chapter: The Emerald Canopy’s Glowing Essence**
**Nurturing Spirit and Essence, the Soul’s Luminous Vitality**—
**Ten Thousand Transformations** shift within the body.
**Nurturing Spirit** means **essence not spilled, spirit preserved**;
if **essence is spilled, spirit departs**.
Only by **cultivating body and life**, not spilling **essence**, is it called **spirit**.
If one **abides within essence**, the **form does not wither**.
If a man **frequently spills Metal essence** from the **Jade Spring**,
his **form decays**, his **body weakens**, and he becomes a **morning ghost**.
If a man **does not spill Metal essence**, his **form transcends the vulgar**,
his **appearance transforms**—all shifts and changes.
With **saliva harmonized**, the **soul enters the sacred Dao**,
and **ten thousand creations** leave **marks of essence and spirit**—
all **Yin records** erase from the **Death Ledger**, registering **Immortal Names** in the **Upper Realm**.

**Breath can be closed for thousands**, the **Five Phases’ true essences** abiding together.
Few who **study the Dao of body and life** succeed—
the **Lower Dan’s true essence** must not be spilled into **semen or breath**,
able to **return to a thousand breaths**, becoming a **spirit-immortal**.
**Five**—**fasting from grain and food for a hundred days** can cure illness.
Yet **only nurturing the Upper** prevents the **Five Viscera’s true essences** from exiting,
giving birth to **spirit at the Crown**.

**Silently recite the True One**, focusing the **mind and will**—
**jade clouds emerge at the brow**.
**Silently recite the True One**—
**day and night, store it in thought**.
**Devote oneself to the Dao**—
**immortality, first banishing the Three Corpses**:
the **Lower Corpse** beneath the heart, the **worms departing**.
**Three hundred sixty breaths**, **twenty inhalations per session**, rest once—
**four times daily**.
Always at **midnight and cockcrow**, recite:
*"The Green Tooth drinks the Morning Flower"*—
**three swallows**.
*"The Southern Vermilion Elixir, drinking from the Elixir Pool"*—
**three swallows**.
*"The Central Wild, gazing at Mount Tai, consuming the Original Essence, drinking from the Rhapsody Spring"*—
**three swallows**.
*"The Western Bright Stone, consuming and drinking the Numinous Liquid"*—
**three swallows**.
*"The Northern Mystic Nourishment, consuming and drinking the Jade Lift"*—
**three swallows**.
Thus, for **thirty days**, the **three worms die**, the **corpses flee**, and the **spirit-essence stabilizes**.

With **constant visualization**, **white essence** naturally appears at the brow,
surrounding the body—
this is the **Jade Cloud Spirit-Essence’s lightning flash**.

At the **nape and back**, **nine halos ride the Purple Mist**,
the **Three Pure Ones descend**, recording **banners and flags**.
**Cultivating body and life**, one gains **golden bones**,
**blood turns to white milk**, the **form emits light**,
later **nine-colored halos** appear, **auspicious clouds and purple mist** rise,
**heaven sends true records**, with **Dragon Maidens before** and **Tiger Flags behind**—
where the **intent goes**, arrival is instant—
this is **spirit-perfection accomplished**.

When **cultivation is complete and the journey fulfilled**, one ascends to **Heaven**,
where **Tortoise and Crane Immortal Children** await.
The **Daoist Cultivator**, refining **body and life**, has **True Yin and True Yang** in the **Dan Field**,
uniting into **Purple-Gold Elixir**—
the **crystallized luster of Sun and Moon’s Souls and Spirits**.
Dispersed as **Flowing Pearls**, this is **perfection and journey’s end**—
**Luan and Feng, White Cranes, and Immortal Children** bring **Heaven’s Edicts**,
riding **Luan and straddling White Cranes**, returning to **Heaven**,
naturally ascending to the **Purple Palace** as **True Immortals**.
