The *Record of the Efficacy of the Spirit-Flight Powder*

I once shared with Censorate Inspector Huishu of Boling a bond of transcending the world to preserve the form, a pact to soar beyond mountains and seas. We often spoke thus: scholars in pursuit of learning explore distant and erroneous paths, ashamed to cultivate what is near and real. They vainly pursue the remote and vast, yet before shedding their vulgar and base nature, they already aspire to ascend as immortals, believing that the Golden Elixir alone can prolong life and that celestial registers are instantly attainable.

Yet if the heart is not truly aligned with the Dao, and the body’s refinement differs not from the ordinary, teeth and hair will not endure, and the complexion will fade with time. This is because qi and blood are inwardly depleted while appearance outwardly transforms. Before illness is dispelled and desires cease their torment, one may die prematurely, failing even to reach the natural span of life. Such blind and deluded pursuits are all too common.

If one seeks true distinction, one must first seek an effective formula. Only after verifying that one’s appearance and teeth differ from the vulgar, and that the natural limits of life are not pressing, may one hope for longevity and the cultivation of immortal potential. Refine the spirit to attain clarity and emptiness, seek to ingest the essence of mushrooms and jade, and in recent times, there have been new insights to rescue the body—these we share to enlighten one another.

One day, Huishu said to me: "There was a guest who spoke of Commander Pei, whose hair had long turned white yet whose complexion remained youthful. When asked what he ingested, he credited the efficacy of the Spirit-Flight Powder." We knew this formula was recorded in the twenty-eighth fascicle of the *Thousand Gold Pieces*.

Huishu further said: "I heard that External Affairs Officer Junyi of Fanyang once studied the Way of qi refinement with the alchemist Wu Hanren. In their discussions of this formula, they noted that the version in the *Thousand Gold Pieces* was incomplete and often unreliable. The original formula derives from the *Scripture of the Grand Clarity*, and one should seek the authentic text to prepare and ingest it according to the method." However, Junyi’s private aspirations remained uncertain as to what he might achieve.

At the time, he was residing in the former residence of Secretary Li Bi. One leisurely day, he chanced upon a small chamber filled with books piled upon the desk—most were torn and incomplete, jumbled in disarray. As he examined nearly half of the scrolls, he suddenly came upon one with an intact header, its calligraphy and ink exceptionally fine. It was titled *Authentic Scripture of the Grand Clarity*, and upon unrolling it, he found the formula for the Spirit-Flight Powder.

Junyi took it and read with joy, his heart truly moved. He hastened to inform the alchemist, who then burned incense, bowed in reverence, and washed his hands to hold the scroll, saying to Junyi: "This is a true legacy of the celestial bureaucracy, a spiritually responsive and particularly efficacious formula, recorded in the immortal scriptures to encourage later learners."

Huishu, knowing that my bond with Junyi was one of profound trust, deemed the transmission credible. We agreed to consult and seek a copy. I rode to his door and, upon hearing the account, obtained a transcription, which I shared with Huishu.

The formula’s ingredients are divided, with "cloud powder" as the principal component. That year, I was appointed to a post in Zhongling, and Mount Lu was within my jurisdiction. Its peaks leapt like waves, its veins flowing into streams and ravines. The local adepts and immortality-seekers all drew from the rushing springs and clouds, where water was cleansed by the sun, and frost and snow gleamed like crystal. The pills rolled like pearls and spiraled like conches, as if crafted by heaven itself.

Sold in village markets, they provided sustenance for clothing and food. The common shops stocked them daily, setting no fixed limit. Among the formula’s essentials, only this one substance was difficult to obtain—yet here, it was readily available. Such was the fortune of this journey.

Indeed, heaven lent its design to my intentions, and thus did it also benefit fellow seekers of the Way—else how could such a convergence have occurred, fulfilling our earlier pact? I privately treasured this numinous revelation, never forgetting it in waking or rest. Traveling through the merchant routes of Lu, I lodged at a leopard’s hidden abode. A courier from Neixiang arrived, speaking of one Deng Yuanrong, who had served as acting magistrate of the former district. Though he had reached the age of fifty, his bearing and temples showed no sign of age, nor had his eyes dimmed. He governed with vigor, receiving guests with the strength of a man in his prime. When asked the source of his vitality, he replied that he had once obtained a divine formula. Upon arriving in the district to investigate, I found it to be the *Lingfei Powder*. Examining its transmission and the efficacy of its medicinal power, he recounted that years earlier, he had met a Tang clerk who had received it orally from a Daoist adept, claiming it was a celestial formula from the immortals. To witness its effects, one could transform hair and complexion in an instant.

Yuanrong had an elderly relative whose countenance and hair had already declined. Seeking to test its numinous power, he requested a portion of the formula. After thirty days of ingestion, his relative’s appearance and hair were suddenly restored to their former state. Yuanrong, having experienced half the dosage’s effect, preserved his youth for decades without change. Regrettably, before the medicine’s full potency could manifest, he ceased its use, and further requests were hindered by distance and exhaustion. Though his resources had since dwindled, he remained distinct from ordinary men. He further recounted that in Chang’an, he had transmitted the formula to the two imperial sons-in-law, Zhang and Pei, both of whom witnessed its transformative effects, confirming what he had previously heard. Thus, the marvel of this formula was verified by repeated evidence, and my eagerness to learn it grew with each account.

Moreover, the recluse Sun, a master of Daoist inquiry, had delved deeply into the essentials of formulas and included this in his compilation—surely not by chance. Fortunate in our encounter with Junyi, Huishu and I fulfilled our earlier vow, pledging to ingest the medicine and await its proof in days to come, continuing this record.

Written in earnest on the fifth day of the fourth month, the seventh year of the Yuanhe era, by Qi Tui of Gaoyang.

The *Taiqing Jing* states: To summon the myriad spirits and seek ascension as an immortal, one must first purify oneself through fasting and ablution, washing the head with fragrant water and bathing the five limbs. After a hundred days of such refinement, one may then invoke the divine. Those who seek immortality should entreat the Perfected Ones of the Northern, Western, and Central Peaks for the *Lingfei Powder*; once obtained and ingested, one is certain to attain transcendence.

The Perfected One says: To seek immortality, eternal youth, and longevity—restoring white hair to black, fallen teeth to growth, a radiant complexion, and luminous flesh—one must take the *Lingfei Powder*.

Lord Lao says: This is the essence of the arts of the Dao, the very foundation of immortality. For Daoists, transcendence becomes effortless; for guardsmen, wandering Mount Hua is within reach; for common men, departed years return; for the elderly, a child’s visage is reborn.

Lord Lao says: Those who take this medicine may defy aging. After ten days of ingestion, one may fast for three years. After three years of use, one may live for three thousand six hundred years. Not I alone, but all who attain the true Dao shall preserve their bodies and become immortals.

**Lingfei Powder Formula**
- 1 *jin* of refined mica
- ½ *jin* (or 1 *jin*) of *fuling* (poria)
- 7 *liang* of *wuzi* kernels (schisandra)
- 7 *liang* of stalactite
- 5 *liang* (or 15 *liang*) of chrysanthemum
- 4 *liang* of *mu* (likely *muxiang*, costus root)
- (One version includes 7 *liang* of ginseng)
- 12 *liang* (or 15 *liang*) of dried rehmannia
- 7 *liang* of cassia heartwood
- 7 *liang* of *xuduan* (dipsacus)

Grind the nine ingredients into fine powder. Then take nineteen *jin* of fresh *tianmendong* (asparagus root), pound it to extract the juice, and use it to form pills. If the juice is abundant, blend it with the powder; if scant, knead it. Place the mixture in a bronze vessel, suspend it beneath a steamer, and steam it with twelve *dou* of millet until cooked. Remove and dry the medicine in the sun, then grind it again into a fine powder. Take a one-*cun* square spoonful every seven days.

This medicine is non-toxic and may be taken in larger doses.

After ten days of consumption, the body will feel light; after twenty days, hearing and vision will sharpen; after seventy days, white hair will turn black again. If all hair has fallen out and teeth have been lost, take twenty-seven *bi* of the medicine, blend it with white honey, and grind it two hundred times until smooth. Form pills the size of *wutong* seeds, yielding approximately eighty-one to eighty-nine pills. Dry them in the sun until thoroughly desiccated. When the surface and interior of the pills become visible—resembling luminous moon pearls or glowing firefly orbs, sometimes red, sometimes white—this is the elixir that immortals carry with them and consume regularly.

To ensure hair and teeth regenerate in due time, take seven pills daily, three times a day, until new growth appears without whitening or shedding. If entering deep mountains without food, these pills may also be taken—seven pills a day will stave off hunger. If hair has not yet fallen out or turned white, the powdered form may be taken instead, granting a lifespan of five to six hundred years without graying. For those whose hair has already turned white, following the aforementioned method will allow it to remain black for up to seven hundred years before falling. Those who seek the Dao and take this medicine without experiencing white hair or tooth loss should consume it twice daily—this is the key to attaining immortality. Shedding teeth and bones is the lesser path of *shijie* (corpse liberation).

When preparing this *Lingfei* powder, taking it for three days will double one’s strength; after five days, blood and qi will flourish; after seven days, the body will feel light; after ten days, the complexion will glow with radiance, and the mind will grow sharp; after fifteen days, one’s stamina will become boundless, allowing one to walk as swiftly as a horse; after twenty days, aging will cease; after thirty-five days, night vision will acquire luminosity.

**Method for Processing Mica:**
- Mix one *jin* of white salt with one *jin* of mica, then grind them together.
  - Grind the mica thoroughly without sifting. Place it in a double-layered cloth bag and press firmly. Rinse with water until all saltiness is removed, then transfer to a silk bag. Hang to dry, and it will become powder.
  - *Alternative method:* Boil the mica in saltwater until it dissolves into a mud-like consistency, then press it into powder.
  - *Another method:* Soak one *jin* of mica in one *dou* of coarse salt within a bronze vessel for three to four days, then steam for a full day. Grind it in a mortar until it becomes powder.
  - *Yet another method:* Boil one *jin* of mica in three *dou* of *poxiao* (sodium sulfate) solution until it forms powder. Dry and spread it out, then examine it under sunlight—if no streaks (*mang*) are visible, it is properly refined. If streaks remain, do not consume it, as prolonged use may cause illness and even death. Refine it meticulously.

This method was originally recorded in the authentic transmission obtained from Lu Silun.

The sutra states: After grinding the mica into a paste, place it in a layered cloth bag and press it thoroughly. Then transfer it into a leather bag and press again. However, this method is generally inferior to using water from Mount Lu’s stone steps to pound and grind it, which yields the finest and most refined powder. If self-prepared and the process is not meticulous, residual streaks (*yingmang*) may remain, which can harm the body—beware. After taking the medicine, avoid carp, and ideally abstain from all fish, as contamination from knives or cutting boards may cause serious harm. Also refrain from consuming blood, including raw meat, raw dried meat, and the like. Cooked blood dishes are not forbidden. Avoid raw onions, garlic, leeks, fermented vinegar, peaches, plums, quince, sour foods, and flowing water. If traveling by river or using water from mountain streams or old wells, boiling it before consumption is acceptable. Barley diminishes the efficacy of mica, so it should also be avoided. This medicine can halt menstrual bleeding, and when combined with the cultivation of a tranquil mind and qi, its effects manifest more swiftly. It must not be taken in the presence of others—thus noted here.

Scholar Sun’s *Secret Essentials of Nurturing Life* states: “Since encountering this formula, nearly thirty-six years have passed. Though I have long admired and delighted in it, I hesitated to put it into practice due to lingering doubts.”

After years of inquiry and seeking, I have repeatedly encountered devoted practitioners who have benefited from this formula, and so I have taken it myself—its effects precisely as described. If one persists in its practice without cease, the merit will not be in vain. *Record of the Transmission of the Wondrous Flying Powder* concludes here.
