**Dongshen Division: Miscellaneous Arts – *Yin Zhengjun’s Five Correspondences of Metals and Stones* (with Preface)**

**Title:** *Yin Zhengjun’s Five Correspondences of Metals and Stones*
**Author:** Unknown. Likely a Tang-dynasty Daoist who falsely attributed the work to the Han-era Yin Changsheng.
**Volume:** One.
**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong era), **Dongshen Division: Miscellaneous Arts**.

Now, the subtlest essence of Heaven and Earth is none other than the **Dao/Way**. Among the Five Phases, the most refined is none other than Black. Among all living things, the most spiritually animated is none other than Man. Among the cycles of light and darkness, none are clearer than the Sun and Moon. Among flowing vital essences, none surpass the rivers and seas. Among the rise and fall of kings, none are more profound than the Four Seasons. Among the principles of **克伐** (subjugation and restraint), none are more cyclical than the Six Celestial Stems (甲,乙,丙,丁,戊,己).

These correspondences, each relying on the Great **Dao/Way**, interact in both harmony and opposition, their effects varying with time and alignment. Yet if one applies **yin-yang** without discerning their true correspondences, even clever techniques will be in vain, laboring without reward.

For Heaven and Earth differ in nature—masculine and feminine, distinct in their operations—and their corresponding interactions bear no fixed reliance.

In ancient times, the most refined Daoist arts of the Celestial Worthies, sacred texts on prolonging life, were compiled into nine volumes. Within them, the trigrams of **Sanwu** (三五, Three and Five) were exhaustively explored, delving into the subtlest essence of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** (德), all applied to the harmonization of Heaven and Earth.

Emerging from the Three Sovereigns (三皇), expounded in the Eight Trigrams (八卦), they first distinguished **Long** (Dragon) and **Hu** (Tiger)—two forces that complement each other, akin in nature to Metals and Stones.

Yu cast the Nine Cauldrons (九鼎), and the Earth established the Nine Palaces (九宫), dividing into Nine Regions (九州). The elixir undergoes nine transformations, and man has nine orifices—seven bright, two dark. The head contains nine **Zhen** (真, "true" or "authentic" essences), while the Big Dipper (北斗) has nine stars, two of which remain unseen. The realm has the Nine-and-Five (九五) hierarchy, and cosmic principles are governed by the Three Elements (三元).

Thus, these correspondences align with time and the Great **Dao/Way**, harmonizing in perfect accord.

Those who grasp this principle may master the **San Dan** (三丹, Three Elixirs) method, for the **Dao/Way** lies before them—not in distant pursuit. Beyond the **San Dan**, there is nothing else to speak of.

Why so? The **San Dan** employs the Great Transformation’s Black essence to solidify, forming the true vital fluids of man in accordance with the Five Phases. From Nine to Nine, the **San Dan**’s ninefold elixir aligns with the **Shangqing** (上清, Supreme Clarity) Canon’s nine volumes, harmonizing with the symbols of the Eight Trigrams.

In the *Shiluji* (实录记, *Record of Authentic Scriptures*), the **Lingbao** (灵宝, "Numinous Treasure") Divine Symbols are ranked first, and the **Xuan Yuan** (玄元, "Mysterious Origin") teachings serve as the **sutra**. The **Hunyuan** (混元, "Primordial Chaos") White Snow Elixir, the **Jiuzhuan** (九转, "Nine Circulations") Eight-Precious Elixir, and the **San Dan** (三丹)—all are transformations of the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, requiring no other external substances. Through cultivation, they become the ultimate **medicine**.

Yet if one speaks of lesser elixir methods using **Dan Sha** (丹砂, cinnabar) and miscellaneous arts, there are myriad techniques in the world. Though they may temporarily cure ailments, they lack the power to transcend the mundane.

Why so? Because their correspondences are confused and misaligned, their use of Black differs, and their **yin** and **yang** do not properly interact. Their methods vary, leading to discord.

For instance, in the preparation of Metal and Stone elixirs, there are seventy-two types of stone. Their origins lie in the deep, hidden layers of Earth, each possessing distinct **yin-yang** natures and temperaments.

Obtained from **Yin Mountains** (阴山), these are the **Yin Stones**—all varieties of **Qing** (青, blue-green). From **Yang Mountains** (阳山), one gathers **Yang Stones**—such as **Liu Huang** (硫黄, sulfur).

If one seeks to harmonize **Yin Stones** and **Yang Stones**, it is like the husband’s song and the wife’s response. If high and low are not properly aligned, the **medicine** will be flawed, and how can it harmonize?

Thus, the *Five Correspondences* is compiled into twenty chapters, passed on to like-minded seekers.

For example, if **Yin Stones** are taken from **Li Mountain** (离山, the South), and **Yang Stones** are obtained from **Beishan** (北山, the North)—where **Shuiyin** (水银, mercury) is produced—transforming **Shuiyin** into **Zhu Sha** (朱砂, cinnabar), which belongs to **Li** (Fire), what then is its origin?

Though **Beishan** is of **Yin** nature, its **Lü** (green) varieties oppose and subjugate it, so it first forms **Shuiyin**, then **Zhu Sha**.

**Zhu Sha**, receiving the Black essence of **Li Fire**, assumes a false crimson form, yet it never fully discards its **Shuiyin** nature. The **Lingbao** teachings, transmitted by **Biling Yangzi** (被陵阳子), reveal that **Zhu Sha**’s **Jin Ye** (金液, "golden fluid") is superficial, its **Zao Bai** (皂白, "alkaline and sulfuric") aspects merely divided. Through the method, one strips away its false crimson form, restoring its true essence, naming it **Tuoti Dan Sha** (脱体丹砂, "Elixir Cinnabar of Detached Form"), also called **Huangu Dan Sha** (换骨丹砂, "Elixir Cinnabar of Transformed Bone"), and also **Baihu Nao** (白虎脑, "White Tiger’s Brain"), thus achieving clarity.

In explaining this **sutra**, the correspondences of Metal and Stone’s **gateways** are aligned, the Five Categories harmonized, and nothing is lost from its original intent.

**First Chapter: Correspondences of Metal and Stone’s Gateways (配合金公相类门)**
**Five Principles (五条):**

1. **The First Correspondence: Forming Metal’s True Essence (配金成质)**
   Using **Lead** (铅), which contains **Yin** yet holds **Yang**, while its **Yang** is the **Silver** (银) within **Lead**. When refined into **Shuiyin** (水银, mercury), one extracts **Huang Hua** (黄华, "yellow flower," a term for lead oxide or refined lead essence).
   **Huang Hua** is the **qi** of **Lead**, **Silver** is the refined essence within **Lead**, and the three substances form the **vital essence** (命). When united as one, they achieve true alchemical substance.

   If a **Daoist adept** (仙士) uses **Lead** to extract **Huang Hua**, the **Lead** lacks **qi**, and extracting the essence leaves **Lead** without its **bone and flesh**. If one substance must contain both **vital essence** and **substantial form**, then removing its **flesh** leaves its **bone** incomplete, removing its **bone** leaves its **flesh** incomplete, and removing its **Huang Hua** leaves it without **qi**—so what use is **Lead** then? If one body lacks its **hun-po** (魂魄, "soul and spirit"), how can it be used?

   The transmitted Daoist teachings reveal how to resolve and discern this.

   **Yin Zhengjun** explains: **Lead’s Huang Hua** is the **qi** of **Lead**, refined into a flower, to interact with **Shuiyin**. Though the two **qi** combine in form, they never fully coalesce into substance. After the **medicine** is prepared, they inevitably separate.

   If one doubts this, refining the mixture into a liquid three times will reveal their separation and reunion, regardless of the method’s specifics.

   The ultimate **medicine**, refined a hundred times into a liquid, circulates clearly without loss. Yet it retains its **hun-po**, making it suitable for ingestion and granting eternal life. If the **medicine** is merely prepared and then artificially constrained, its **form and spirit** will not endure—how could it then fortify one’s **vital essence** and **life force**?

   This shows that **Lead** has lost the **qi** of **Huang Hua**, thus proving its incompleteness. The correspondences have reversed, its **sinews and bones** (筋骨) forever severed, and it remains fundamentally distinct.

2. **The Second Correspondence: Extracting Silver from Lead (采铅中银)**
   Known as **Tiansheng Ya** (天生芽, "Heavenly Born Bud").

   Directly refining **Shuiyin** into substance, this substance relies on **Lead** for its formation, discarding **flesh** to take **bone**. Yet **bone** lacks **qi**, rendering it **form and spirit incomplete**.

   The verse states:
   *"Do not destroy my Lead—my Vital Essence must remain whole.*
   *If destroyed, Lead will have no bone, no flesh, no qi—*
   *the Three Talents (三才) are incomplete—*
   *what then is the Elixir Field (丹田)?"*

「Again the verse says:
*"Use Lead or not use Lead—*
*when Lead is used, the Three Talents are whole.*
*When Lead is used and the Three Talents are whole,*
*that is the true Elixir Field.*

*Lead must be whole,*
*then one may recognize its category.*

All who acknowledge Lead must not harm its true essence—
Lead must not be mixed with external substances.
If mixed, its form and spirit lack **qi**—
until the Elixir Field is thus,
how could it ever manifest?

Since ancient times, **Daoists** (仙士) have used **Huang Hua** (黄华) and **Lead** (铅) in their purest form;
their methods are extraordinary,
different from common practices,
yet aligned without contradiction—
Dao can return to unity.

**The Third Correspondence:** Using **Jin Gong** (金公) without harming it,
the **Divine Symbol** (神符) in its pure form becomes **Xuan Yuan** (玄元, "Mysterious Origin").

**Xuan Yuan** is the **Heavenly Mirror** (天镜),
the Heavenly Mirror is the Three Talents undivided.
**Huang Hua** (黄华) within Lead is **qi**,
**Lead’s essence** (铅精) as Silver is bone,
and **Lead’s substance** (铅质) is flesh—
when the Three Talents are fully employed,
the pure essence of **Xuan Yuan** is not lost.

One day is **water** (水), two days is **fire** (火);
Lead contains the Three Talents whole—
it can be used to attain the Dao,
thus its efficacy is never lost.

The **Divine Symbol** is the head of Heaven and Earth,
and the **superior elixir** originates from the *Five Symbol Scripture* (《五符经》).
Its five **Symbols** (符) emerge from the **Spiritual Water Immortal Palace** (灵水仙宫),
formed by water, used as elixir.

**The Fourth Correspondence:** Refining **Lead** through **nine transformations** (九转),
Lead must remain whole.

If Lead is whole, the Three Talents are preserved—
its **Huang Hua** does not lose its place,
and its **Huang Hua** fully harnesses the **qi** of Lead.

A furnace must have three feet—
none may be missing.
If **qi** is lacking, the Dao will never be achieved;
if an elixir lacks spirit and essence, it will not be efficacious.

Why so?

Within **Huang Hua**, there are no sinews, bones, or flesh—
the Three Talents are thus incomplete.
Even after half a year,
if it is tested and found to be fully consumed,
its **qi** cannot be contained—
how could one use what is powerless?

Categories do not follow one another;
preservation and combination yield success.
Guest and host must unite,
but **Shuiyin** (水银) is contrary—
each departs on its own.

**The Fifth Correspondence:** The Dao of **Jin Gong** (金公),
preserving its **great elixir** (大丹),
with form and spirit both complete,
unchanged in its true nature—
the treasure of life lies within my true Lead.

If Lead is not true,
its **mercury** (汞) will not be intimate;
the true is already whole in the Three Talents.

Flesh is Heaven,
also the Mother—
the Mother within **Qian** (乾, "Heaven"),
contains the **yang Heaven** (阳天).
Within Lead, Silver is the **yin Earth** (阴地),
Earth nurtures all things.
**Huang Hua** is **qi**,
**qi** sustains all things—
if **Daoists** use it without breaking its **vehicle** (车),
then it is true Lead.

The verse says:
*"Do not break my vehicle,*
*let me return home—*
*for that is my life.*

The **vehicle** is another name for Lead;
if broken, the Three Talents are incomplete—
useless for any purpose.

Again it is said:
**Huanglong zhi** (黄龙汁, "Yellow Dragon Essence"),
is the **Huang Hua** essence of Lead refined into a liquid.
Common folk use this liquid to administer it,
calling it **Lead’s Huang Hua**.

If Lead lacks this liquid,
how could it be of use?

The true Lead spoken of here
is not of the five metals, earth, or stone variety.
Seekers of the Dao must carefully examine and clarify its principles.»

**Section Twenty: Alchemical Refining of Mercury (配合水银相类门第二十)**

**First Name: Xuan Water (玄水)**
Xuan Water is the primordial *qi* of water in its embryonic state. After a thousand years, it congeals—neither fully solid nor fully formed—yet not yet a true embryo. Thus it is called Xuan Water, yet it is unfit for use.

**Second Name: Xuan Pearl Flowing Mercury (玄珠流汞)**
Flowing Mercury is the luminous *qi* of water. After two thousand years, it becomes Xuan Water Pearl, now true mercury, though still unrefined for elixir-making. This is the initial stage of mercury.

**Third Name: Riverbank Old Woman (河上姥女)**
This is the three-thousand-year *qi* of water, now fully mercury, tinged with green. It is called *Riverbank Old Woman*—when exposed to fire’s *yang* *qi*, it flees at the slightest flame, yet cannot yet endure fire. Only those who practice the Dao of mercury should use this.

**Fourth Name: Tai Yin (太阴)**
After four thousand years, mercury surpasses the three-thousand-year mark and is called Tai Yin—aged mercury, now fit for use.

**Fifth Name: Chi Emperor Flowing Mercury (赤帝流汞), also named Red Blood General (赤血将·军)**
This emerges from the Vermilion Palace’s red waters, infused with *yang* *qi* and redness, forming cinnabar. This is mercury’s alternate name.
It accumulates the *qi* of the Primordial Chaos, forming the Yin Mountain.
Yin Mountain is perilous—it yields mercury.
Mercury is the true *qi* of Chaos.
Ultimately, it is the refined *qi* of Tai Yin—unfaltering before fire, neither consumed nor diminished. When harmonized with the Great Transformation, it holds the supreme merit of immortality and transcendence.

**Sixth Name: Xuan Water Golden Elixir (玄水金液), also named Xuan Water Mercury (玄水水银)**
Born from water, it congeals into mercury, then achieves the Great Transformation.
Daoists refine it into the *Xuan Water Dan Lead* form, its upper essence named Golden Elixir—this is the divine talisman, originating from the Water Crystal Palace.

**Seventh Name: Xuanming Dragon Grease (玄明龙膏), also named Drawn Dizziness Cinnabar (抽晕丹砂)**
Xuanming means without *qi* haze. Dragon Grease is another name for white snow.
After suppression by fire, it remains unaltered. When ingested, its effects are beyond measure.
Yet if applied to malignant sores, it acts instantly—thus called Dragon Grease, with great efficacy.

**Eighth Name: Mercury Tiger Alum (水银虎矾)**
When mercury enters alum stones, it forms medicinal compounds, neutralizing all venomous creatures and refining into the five metals—treasured by the world.
Yet if ingested with alum, it becomes unusable.

**Ninth Name: White Tiger Brain, Xuanwu Bone (白虎脑、玄武骨)**
A collective term, also called White Cinnabar or Heavenly Sprout.
Directly processed mercury, which reunites with its essence upon exposure to fire.
Also called *Child-Mother Mutual Generation*—never departing its origin. This is the Heavenly Sprout.

**Tenth Name: Sand Compliance (砂顺), also named Metal Stubbornness (金顽), also named Taiyang Flowing Pearl (太阳流珠)**
These three names of mercury possess transformative power, becoming worldly treasures—beneficial for ailments and immortality, rivaling Heaven and Earth’s creation. All things submit, forming the Dao.

**Lingyang Ziming (陵阳子明)** is another name for mercury. This immortal sage, through countless kalpas, exhausted its elixir nature, combining Three Yellows, Two Greens, and One White. He gathered life’s essence from the Child-Midnight and Parent-Noon, merging with the Central Palace’s *yin-yang* harmony, penetrating the Yin Mountain to discern mercury’s true nature—thus defining its alternate names.
If fit for ingestion, it follows its prescribed methods. Yet without true understanding, even if used in alchemy, it risks flight or failure, lacking transcendental merit.
All clever deceits pale compared to recognizing mercury’s true nature—when properly aligned, they merge as one.
Lingyang Ziming examined Yin-Yang Mountains’ mercury, knowing its purity without flaw.
True mercury contains crimson veins like blood—this is the supreme essence of aged Yin Mountain.
Green is called *Riverbank Old Woman*; white is called *Xuan Water Flowing Pearl*, also *White Tiger Brain*.
*White Tiger Brain* is also named *White Cinnabar*.
Daoists, stripping its *qi* haze, reveal its pristine whiteness—thus *White Cinnabar*, a name for the three-to-four-thousand-year stage.
Today’s *Chénjǐn cinnabar* is also called *cinnabar*, but if Daoists harmonize *yin-yang* and suppress it with fire, it is called *Suppressed-Fire Mature Cinnabar*—not to be confused with *Cinnabar*.
*White Tiger Brain* has three names: First, *White Tiger Brain*; Second, *White Golden Elixir*; Third, *White Cinnabar*.

Lingyang Ziming easily discerns mercury’s nature—its transformation into gold and immortality. When properly refined, the Great Transformation’s principles are never in vain.

**Section Three of the Copper Green Category (配合曾青相类门第三)**

**First Name: Copper Green Dragon Grease (曾青青龙膏)**
Copper Green Dragon Grease is mercury’s destiny.
If transformed with Copper Green into grease, mercury’s sacred Dao is fulfilled.
It is also mercury’s envoy, capable of refining mercury into an elixir.
Called *grease* because mercury within achieves elixir form—its elixir is spiritually potent, suitable for ascension.
Without Copper Green grease, mercury flees like a dragon before fire—thus Copper Green is mercury’s grease.

**Second Name: Copper Green Phoenix Wing (青龙翘)**
Copper Green originates from the *mu* wood category—wood contains fire, symbolizing Copper Green’s metallic essence.
Without fire in wood, Copper Green’s metal remains obscure—just as humans require *yin-yang* soul and spirit to manifest form.

「This fourth significance illustrates how mercury is contained within the body of cinnabar.
Its third name is **Copper Green Envoy (青腰使者)**.
Copper Green resides in water—its name is also **Waterless (亦无二三)**.
When alchemists prepare it, it resembles an elixir of ascension,
and thus takes its name from the result obtained.
Yet when comparing its efficacy, each takes its own merit,
and by examining its gains and losses,
one understands that Copper Green easily harmonizes with mercury’s nature.
The names **Copper Green Dragon Grease (青龙膏)** and **Copper Green Phoenix Wing (青龙翘)**
arise from mercury—
mercury, like a dragon, flees at the sight of fire,
but Copper Green grease subdues and restrains it,
earning the title **Dragon-Tiger Elixir (龙虎丹)**.
With five parallels now established,
it is clear that Copper Green possesses the power to **restrain mercury (驻水银)**,
and also to **restrain the vital essence of life (驻生灵之命)**,
harmonizing with mercury’s nature as it aligns with Copper Green’s own.

Thus, it is known that Copper Green, paired with wood,
is perfectly matched with mercury,
and **Child of Clarity (子明)** refines it without error.

**Category: Sulfur and Its Analogues (配合硫黄相类门第四)**
Sixth Name: **Sulfur’s First Name (玫始初之名)**,
also called **Sulfur (硫黄)**,
which emerges from the **Yang Stone Mountains (阳石之山)**.
When **Nuwa (女娲)** discovered it and used it to seal the **Pit of Stopped Fat (停脂穴)**,
the **Immortal Masters (真人)** deliberated upon it.
The **Green Pit (绿穴)** extends hundreds of feet deep,
and within it flows a stone essence that hardens upon exposure to wind,
resembling yellow gold in hue—
thus, it is named **Sulfur (硫黄)**.
Originally, it was called **Stone-Stopped Fat (石停脂)**.
Its second name is **Yellow Flower (黄英)**,
for it produces a yellow fluid from the **Yang Stone (阳石)**,
which solidifies into stone—
hence, the name **Yellow Flower (黄英)**.
Its third name is **Yellow Candle (黄烛)**,
also a form of **Stone-Stopped Fat (石停脂)**,
whose nature carries the **essence of the Sun (太阳炁)**,
flaming when exposed to fire—
thus, it is named **Yellow Candle (黄烛)**.
Its fourth name is **Lawful Yellow (法黄)**,
for when **Nuwa (女娲)** refined it, she attained the **Dao of Yellow (黄道)**,
and thus it was named **Lawful Yellow (法黄)**.
Its fifth name is **Nine Spirits of Pure Yang (九灵黄童)**.
The **Nine Spirits (九灵)** refer to the nine names of the Sun,
and **Pure Yang (黄童)** denotes the nature of a **virgin boy (童子)**—
free from **yin**, hence its name.

Its sixth name is **Yellow-White Sand (黄白砂)**.
According to **Immortal Techniques (仙法)**,
when **Stone-Stopped Fat (石停脂)** is subdued,
and fire is restrained, yielding a yellow-white hue,
its **Dao** will soon transform the **Five Metals (五金)** into treasures.
Later, it is said:
*Sulfur also stands alone as a category,*
*possessing the method to **save the poor (救贫)**.*
*With one category alone,*
*it can transmute the **Five Metals (五金)** into worldly treasures.*
If one follows the **Heavenly Dao of the Immortals (天仙之法)**,
and **restrains mercury to become white gold (住水银成白金)**,
while **transforming Copper Green into the Sun’s essence (反曾青为太阳)****,
then it becomes the **elixir of Heaven and Man (天人之仙药)**.

The names of **Stone-Stopped Fat (停脂穴)** originate with **Nuwa (女娲)**,
who revealed its **divine transformation (神化之功)**,
and passed its new name down through the ages.
The most refined essence of Heaven and Earth
cannot surpass the **Dao (道)**.
Within the **Dao**, the subtlest aspect
cannot surpass **qi (炁)**.
To **nurture qi and settle the soul (养炁安魂)**,
nothing surpasses **mercury and the Sun’s essence (水银太阳)****.
To **refine the spirit and preserve the essence (炼魄存神)**,
nothing surpasses **Sulfur (硫黄)**.
For **proclaiming restraint and explaining concealment (宣制解释)**,
as well as **harboring and nourishing (含藏育养)****,
nothing exceeds **Yellow Dragon Essence (黄龙汁)**—
which is merely another name for **lead (铅)**.
For **tranquility and immobility (安静不动)**,
nothing surpasses **Copper Green Envoy (青腰使者)**.
The **Copper Green Envoy (青腰使者)** possesses its own **divine transformation (神化之功)**,
**pressing the strong and soothing the weak (压强抚弱)**,
**harboring the hundred spirits of gold essence (含金液之百灵)***,
**settling mercury’s true nature (定水银之真性)**,
**calming the Four Spirits (安四神)***,
**harmonizing the Five Zang Organs (调五藏)***,
**aiding the Sea of Qi (助气海)***,
**capable of both ascension and descent (能升能沉)**.
If one **understands its method (解)**, it ascends as **Yellow God (黄神)**;
if one does not **understand (不解)**, it descends.
Descending, it leads to death;
ascending, it grants immortality.
If one **settles (定)** the **Stone-Stopped Fat (停脂穴)**,
then it possesses the power to **nourish humanity (育人)**.
If one fails to **settle and subdue Sulfur’s nature (不定伏得硫黄之性)**,
its toxicity will manifest late—
it will surely **kill (杀人)**.
If an adept **settles and subdues the Three Yellows (雄黄黄芽，并水银之异性)***,
**uniting them with Copper Green as Yellow God (解使曾青为黄神)***,
and **binds and refines Copper Green into a yellow hue (胶炼曾青黄色)***,
then this is the **hidden name of the Supreme Dao (至道中)**.
When the **great secret of subduing the Three Yellows (伏定三黄之大诀)***
is mastered,
one can **transmute all things (变化万物)**—
nothing cannot be transmuted.
If the **Three Yellows (三黄)** are subdued by fire,
each must retain its **original hue (元色)**,
and all must be **paired in parent-child succession (子母相承)**.
If one uses **unrelated substances (别性物)***,
they will not **enter the category (入类)**—
one should **ponder and discern (思知见)***,
**generating treasures from treasures (以宝生宝)**.
If one **understands (解)**, it is swift;
if one does not **understand (不解)**, it is as distant as two strangers facing each other.
The **Dao** lies within oneself—
if one **attains it (得)**, the names will follow;
if one **seeks and examines its parallels (类考寻知)***,
and uses **nothing impure (不杂)***,
then one is **skilled (善)**.

**Category: Realgar and Its Analogues (配合雄黄相类门第五)**
Eleventh Name: **Realgar (雄黄)**,
which originates from the **Western Metal (西方兑宫)**—
why so?
Realgar is **Regal (庚)** and **Metal (辛)**,
the **offspring of Metal (兑金之苗)***,
borrowing the **qi of Regal and Metal (庚辛之炁)***
to coalesce into **Realgar (雄黄)****,
emerging from **Wudu Mountain (武都山)**.
This mountain is most **numinous (灵)**—
those without **proper understanding (理)**, cannot obtain it.
One must **perform rituals and declarations (祝醮启告)***
before beginning to **extract it (采)**.
Even then, out of ten thousand who attempt it,
none truly **know its use (知其所用)**—
this is how its category was revealed.
Later, in the **Later Han Dynasty (后汉)**, the **Dark Lord (阴君)** sought its location,
discerned its **color and properties (色目)**,
and through **examination of the arts of the Immortals and Saints (众仙圣之术)***,
gained clarity.
Moreover, Realgar has **ten general names (十一般名)***,
each with its own **application (所用)**.
Those who practice **Daoist alchemy (药道士)***
must **know its roots (根源)**.
If one takes **Realgar from Wudu Mountain (武都雄黄)***
and attempts to **subdue and refine it into an elixir (伏炼丹)***,
one will **fail to understand its true use (不解用药)***,
nor will one **grasp the Dao’s origins (会道之根源)**.
Even if one **偶然 achieves a crude elixir (偶成丹)***,
it will **not be fit for consumption (不堪服食)**.
Some may **fail entirely (作不成)**,
and later **blame it on spirits and gods (妄推鬼神所作)***,
claiming **rituals were ineffective (祭祀无功)**,
yet they **err by relying on ancient texts (误凭古文)***,
**using Realgar indiscriminately (信手称情)***—
this is not the **path of true Daoists (知道之流)**.

Its first name is **Crimson Phoenix Sinew (朱雀筋)**.
**Crimson Phoenix Sinew (朱雀筋)** refers to its **subdued qi forming substance (伏炁成质)***,
first bearing a **crimson hue (朱色)**.
After **five thousand years (五千年)**,
it transforms into a **yellow color (黄色)**.
If one seeks **Crimson Phoenix Sinew (朱雀筋)**,
the **fresh yellow (黄新)** is unfit for **major use (大用)***,
and its **power is weak (力又薄)**.
The common folk, seeing this,
**contend it is fine Realgar (争言云好雄黄)***—
this is greatly mistaken.
If one **merely combines it with herbal elixirs (合草药小丹方)***,
it may **serve minor purposes (任意用得)**.
Yet for **great, rational applications (入理大用)***,
or to **subdue, refine, and transmute (拟制伏变化)***,
it is **indeed unfit for use (实未堪用)**.

「Its second name is **Gòuchén (勾陈)**—
this is **Realgar** after it has shed its crimson hue and gradually turns yellow, hence the name **Gòuchén**.
If used as medicine, **eight or nine times out of ten** it fails to achieve full efficacy,
and it **cannot endure fire-refining**.

Its third name is **Tàiyī (太一)**—
the **stone of the first decan**, its **medicinal form now fully yellow**, fit for fire-testing.

Its fourth name is **Ròuhuáng (揉黄)**—
here, **Realgar** has fully formed.
At the end of a **great kalpa (大劫)**,
it may be used **freely in any direction** without hesitation.

Its fifth name is **Huángnú (黄奴)**—
**Huángnú** is the **servant of mercury (水银之使)**,
earning its name as it **preserves yin-yang qi** when immersed in mercury.

Its sixth name is **Dìnánjīng (帝男精)**—
another name for **Huángnú**, akin to **Tàiyin (太阴)**,
where **qi transforms daily** through their union—
like a woman receiving a man’s seed.

Its seventh name is **Dānrìhún (丹日魂)**—
this is **Realgar in its extreme yang**, the **soul of the sun**,
earning the title **Tàiyáng (太阳)**.

Its eighth name is **Shíhuáng (石黄)**—
**Shíhuáng** is the **essence of Realgar**,
not only used for **subduing and refining**,
but when **worn on the body**, it renders one **impervious to blades and arrows**.
If carried **raw and unrefined**, it suffices—
but when **further combined into the Three Yellows (三黄)**,
**subdued by fire and transmuted**, it becomes a **treasure of supreme transformation (大造化之宝)**,
and a **path to transcendence (出世之门)**—
this is no empty claim.

Its ninth name is **Huángjīn (黄金)**—
this single substance, **subdued and refined by fire into yellow**,
when **assisted by subtle yellow divine glue (微微黄神胶)**,
can **solely transmute the Five Metals into gold**,
unbound by the **limits of alum (矾石)**.

Its tenth name is **Huángcāng (黄苍)**—
**Huángcāng** is **aged Realgar**.
Not only can it be **refined into an elixir**,
but even a **touch carried by children** suffering from **demonic possession or illness (邪魅鬼病)** will **instantly cure them**.

Its eleventh name is **Dìnánxuè (帝男血)**—
here, **Realgar** appears **cloaked in white**, yet **veined with blood-red light**,
translucent as empty space, **bright as blood**—
this is **true Realgar**.

If **properly combined with qi at the right moment**,
the resulting product **harmonizes with the Three Realms (三才)**.
After **three years of purification in the crucible**,
when taken according to **prescribed measures (法度)**,
one may **ascend immediately**.

It originates from **extreme southern Wǔdū Mountain (极南武都山)**.

One substance, many names—
each with its own application.
The **laws left by immortals** are **known in full**,
and those who begin with skill **achieve success**.

The **Supreme Medicine** has undergone **ten thousand refinements**,
thus earning its names.
Some **establish distinct names**,
but when **unified in essence (总解)**,
its **mystical principles (妙理)** are **fathomless**.
When **aligned with the root source (根元)**,
its use is **without error**,
and when **harmonized with qi**, it **succeeds**.

If one **uses medicine indiscriminately without regard to its source**,
and **names it Dao**—
this is **misguided**.

For **heaven’s essence is extreme yang**,
while **earth’s essence is extreme yin**—
**moistening downward**, it becomes **rivers and seas**,
**nourishing earth’s meridians (血脉)**.
**Heaven has the Milky Way (河)**,
connecting with **earth’s circulating qi (通炁)**,
forming **suspended symbols (悬象)**—
**heaven above has no water**.

The **ultimate precision of heaven and earth**
does not exceed **holding fast to the One (守一)**,
yet it **divides into the Three Realms (三才)**,
mirroring the **Three Great Elixirs (三大丹)**,
**inheriting the Five Virtues (五德)** to give birth.

Later practitioners, following these **supreme methods**,
**seek in myriad ways**,
applying **heterodox and perverse techniques (邪异施)**—
using **substances devoid of qi**,
**shifting with time**,
and thus **inviting great calamity**.

How could the world know?
The **ultimate precision** does not exceed **holding fast to the One**,
while **establishing principles** does not exceed the **Three Realms**.
**Mutual generation** does not depart from the **Five Phases (五行)**,
**concealment** does not depart from **water and fire**.
The **principle of correspondence** originates from **the One**.

When **two complementary forces (两情)** are **paired**—
**capable as husband, capable as wife**—
**yin at its peak gives rise to yang**,
and thus **perfect medicine is formed**—
all such **depend on the Great Yang (太阳)** and **Great Yin (太阴)**.

**Pairing with Lead Essence (铅精) – Twenty-One Names**

**Lead Essence (铅精)**, when used by immortals, has **many names**.
If one **knows how to apply it**, one **does not stray from the Way**.

1. **Qiānhuā (铅花)**—
   the **qi of lead**, capable of **subduing mercury**,
   though it may **temporarily resist fire**,
   it ultimately **lacks true completion (了义)**,
   yet it **dissolves the Three Poisons (三毒)**,
   **fully transforming into emptiness**.

2. **Qiānjīng (铅精)**—
   the **silver within lead**,
   when **combined with mercury medicine**,
   forms a **kindred substance**—
   yet **lead’s nature** remains the **great affliction within the elixir**.

3. **Xuánhuáng (玄黄)**—
   the **essence of lead**,
   when **united with mercury’s qi**,
   **preserves the Three Realms**,
   **unchanging in true nature**,
   serving as **divine talisman (神符)** and **celestial mirror (天镜)**.
   When **entered into lead**, it becomes **its sinew and bone**.

4. **Huángyá (黄芽)**—
   the **yellow bloom of lead**—
   **yellow bloom** is the **qi of lead**,
   when **united with mercury**,
   **retains lead’s form**—
   this is **Huángyá**.

5. **Fēiqīng (飞轻)**—
   the **refined essence of lead**,
   though **extracted and combined with lead**,
   it is **none other than cinnabar (丹砂)**.
   When used, one must **know that two kinds share the Great Yang’s qi**—
   **one must not be lacking**,
   and they must be **interwoven in application**.

**Heaven’s Canopy (天盖)** resides within lead—
**Heaven’s Canopy** is the **Pool of Flowers (华池)**,
and **Pool of Flowers** is the **water foundation**.

6. **Huángjǔ (黄举)**,
7. **Zǐgēn (紫根)**—
   these **two names**, when **refined a hundred times**,
   yield **medicine of absolute purity (绝粒之药)**,
   whose **effects are immeasurable**.

8. **Huánghuá (黄华)**,
9. **Héchē (河车)**—
   these **two names** can **subdue mercury**,
   circulating **throughout the Microcosmic Orbit (周天)**,
   **neither distant nor near**, **losing not a single grain**.

10. **Lìzhìshí (立制石)**,
11. **Qiānjīng (铅精)**,
12. **Huángqīng (黄轻)**,
13. **Huánglóng (黄龙)**,
14. **Fúdān (伏丹)**,
15. **Huángchí (黄池)**—

**Lìzhìshí (立制石)** is **lead after it sheds its form**, turning **white as stone**,
capable of **subduing mercury**,
becoming the **supreme medicinal lead essence (至药铅精)**.
Immortal methods **refine metals and stones**—
if **poison remains**, it **cannot be ingested**.

**Huángqīng (黄轻)** is another name for **yellow bloom (黄华)**—
when used, it is **as light as bloom (轻华)**,
yet **capable of heavy application**.
It can **transform yellow and white substances into treasure**.

**Huánglóng (黄龙)** and **Fúdān (伏丹)** are alternate names for **lead bloom (铅华)**.»

The **Huángchí (黄池)** is another name for **refining lead (修铅)**.

The above are all **various names for lead in alchemical formulas (诸杂丹方回名立字)**.
Ancient Daoists practiced methods of **subduing mercury (制汞)**,
earning their **yearly titles (当年之号)**,
yet these were **never recorded in official annals (不上实录)**.

16. **Jīngōng (金公)**,
17. **Jiǎgōnghuáng (假公黄)**,
18. **Mùxī (木锡)**,
19. **Fēixióng (飞雄)**,
20. **Tàisùjīn (太素金)**,
21. **Tiānxuán (天玄)**—

All the above are **extracted from the *Divine Symbols Recorded Alchemical Dao/Way (神符录丹术大道记)***.

**Jīngōng (金公)** is another name for **lead (铅)**.
Moreover, **native lead of this region (本州土人)** must be used—
**one must know the proper application and not err**.

**Jiǎgōnghuáng (假公黄)** refers to **lead that has already produced silver and bloom (已出银并华了)**—
it is said to **lack purity and essence (无精华)**, making it **unfit for use (不堪用)**.

**Mùxī (木锡)** is the **refined essence of lead (铅之精华)**,
capable of **entering mercury as supreme medicinal lead (入汞为至药)**,
**preserving its Dao/Way (不失其道)**.

**Fēixióng (飞雄)** is **lead entering the Great Yang (太阳)**,
becoming **pure Yang (纯阳)**,
and **can be forged into a cauldron (可作鼎)**.
It is also **akin to the *qi* of silver (炁银之类)**.

The names **Mùxī (木锡)** and **Fēixióng (飞雄)**,
both **Divine Symbols (神符)**,
are recorded in the alchemical Dao/Way—
**one must not lose the essence of lead (不得失铅精)**,
and **the *qi* and spirit must be harmonized (炁魄合数)**.

**Lead is fundamentally silver in nature (铅本是银质)**,
while **silver is fundamentally lead in spirit (银本是铅胎)**.
**Yin governs the Great Yang (太阳)**,
while **Yang governs the Great Yin (太阴)**.
**The Yang within Yin (阴中之阳)** is **lead containing silver essence (铅含银精)**.
**The Yin within Yang (阳中之阴)** is **cinnabar embracing the *qi* of water-silver (朱砂怀水银之炁)**.

If **they are paired according to their kind (相配类)**,
they are collectively called **the *qi* of embryo and breath (胎息之炁)**,
yet **they have not yet reached the rank of treasure (未见成宝之位)**.

If **one can grasp their intended use (解用之意)**, then **moistening (润)** them,
**they become formless (无象)** when **properly transformed (成之)**.

**The Three Treasures must be complete (三才必备)**,
**the Four Symbols must remain unharmed (四象不伤)**,
**preserving the *qi* in its entirety (全炁而行)**,
**thus aligning with the Great Dao/Way (於其大道)**.

If **one cleverly misapplies their intent (巧计用意)**,
taking **formless substances (无炁之物)**,
and **pairing them to forge an elixir (相配成丹)**,
**one will fall into grave error (自大误矣)**.

The **secret key to the Three Spirits Elixir (三灵丹秘诀)** states:
**The lead *qi* must be united with the primordial (铅炁合元)**,
**the process must be fully embodied (事须体全)**,
**like a man and woman in union (如人交合)**,
**extracting the *qi* of a maiden (采少女之炁)**,
**must merge with the original body (须合本体)**.
Thus, **pairing their kinds, Yin and Yang’s dual nature (配类阴阳二性)**,
**the host and guest’s mutual affinity (主客两情)**,
**whether they are close or not (亲不亲之)**,
**whether they are obtained or not (得不得之)**,
**the Two Principles must correspond in kind (两仪相类)**,
**and the Dao/Way and virtue must transform cyclically (道德展转)**.

Later disciples **use without understanding (用以不用)**,
**act arbitrarily (任情而为)**.
I **dare not proceed without proper intent (终不敢随意而行也)**.

The **Primeval Lead**, also called *Tàisù Jīn* (太素金), or **Dan Earth Yellow**, is refined from *húfěn* (胡粉) transformed into *qiān bái* (铅白). It is also named *Qīngjīn* (青金), another appellation for *Tàisù Jīn*. Its name aligns with the **Great Yang** (太阳), harmonized and refined through alchemical processes. When drained, it yields a **Celestial Indigo Elixir (青丹天玄)**, also called the **Suppressed Indigo Elixir (伏玄丹)**.

Its preparation involves using *qiān huā* (铅华) as the **Flower Pool**, into which *shuǐyín* (水银) is introduced as the **Double Flower Elixir**. When fused in the crucible and burned into medicine, any residual *qiān jiāng* (铅浆) is of no use.

The above describes the **refined essence of lead (铅精)**, whose alchemical function is supreme and whose transformations are boundless. Those of shallow understanding grasp only its outward form, unable to seek its true essence. They recklessly adulterate it with foreign substances, corrupting its pure and refined essence.

Those who seek ultimate truth must pursue **true lead (真铅)**, ensuring no impurities are mixed.

**Pairing with White Cinnabar (白丹砂) – Seventh and Sixth Classifications**

1. **Heaven-Born Sprout Cinnabar (天生芽丹砂)**, known as **White Cinnabar (白丹砂)**.
   The **Suppressed Primordial Spirit-Qi of the Great Yang (伏元神炁太阳)** is called **Natural Qi (自然之炁)**.
   It contains the **Essence of Fire (含火之精)**, named **Spiritual Cinnabar (灵砂)**. Among all cinnabars, its sprouts grow longest. As recorded in the *Dan Book* (丹书) *Huáng Lù Jì* (黄录记):
   *"True cinnabar resembles true pearls; thus, the Immortals named it **True Pearl Cinnabar (真珠砂)**, also called **Heaven-Born Sprout (天生芽)**."*

   Directly refining *gōng* (汞/mercury) without additional medicines, this cinnabar, when applied, causes mercury—regardless of quantity—to **suppress fire** upon exposure. It can **transform barren mercury into efficacy**, refining it to a golden hue. It can also **transmute the Five Metals into treasure**.

2. **Immortal Cinnabar (仙砂)**.
   Immortals require no external medicines for their elixir substance, nor do they use artificial crucibles or tripods. They simply ingest this white cinnabar to achieve longevity. They do not refine mercury into an elixir; thus, Immortals designate it as **White Cinnabar (白丹砂)**—the **Heaven-Born Sprout**.

3. **Vermilion Black Cinnabar (朱乌砂)**.
   This cinnabar originates from the **Southern Palace of the Fire Deity (离宫南方)**, belonging to Fire. Its name derives from its association with the Southern direction.

4. **Mercury Cinnabar (汞砂)**.
   Named for its unoxidized, pristine white form resembling sand.

5. **Stone Spleen Cinnabar (石脾砂)**.
   This cinnabar is found in **stone beds (石床)** or between layered stones, appearing white and resembling stone in color.

6. **Red Emperor’s Salt (赤帝卤咸)**.
   The Southern direction belongs to the **Red Emperor (赤帝)**. This cinnabar resembles white grains of salt, symbolizing its name. Immortals classify it differently.

---
**Pairing with Gold (金) – Eighth and Fourth Classifications**

1. **Regal White Gold (庚辛白金)**.
   Gold is numbered four, hence its four names. Originally formless, it is symbolized by the **Western direction (西方)**, associated with *Gēng* (庚) and *Xīn* (辛).
   Thus, one understands the **Immortal Dao’s divine transformations**, where *qi* is paired and refined to form substances. It is unclear whether mercury originates from **golden water** or if gold itself is unfit for elixir-making. The Immortals’ symbolic teachings cannot be measured by conventional logic.

   **Regal White Gold (庚辛白金)** is not formed from metallic gold but from **natural *qi*, creating a treasure of great transformation**. It is not artificial gold but the accumulation of ingested gold, refining the body into a **divine, transformed essence**. Thus, the **Great Dao is profound and mysterious**, beyond the grasp of ordinary minds.

2. **Primeval Lead (太素金)**—its name reflects its original essence.
3. **束方 Day-Sun (束方日阳)**.
4. **Mao Wood Green-Gold (卯木青金)**—named after the **Three Sovereigns**, with Huangdi later establishing its title.
   *束方 Day-Sun* is also called **Male Left (男左)**, representing **Mao Wood Green-Gold (卯木青金)**, all crafted by Immortals under distinct names.

The **Three Sovereigns** paired with the Western direction. Later, the **Great Sage (太上)** traveled to the **Flowing Sands (流沙)**, refining true lead into medicine, all originating from the teachings of *Gēng* and *Xīn*.

This is the **law of the Primordial Lord (元始君)**, who established symbols for humanity, who otherwise could not naturally form metallic substances. Thus, through ingesting gold, one achieves a **spiritually transformed body**.

Later, in the **Year of the Tortoise Shell (龟甲元年)**, the **Emperor’s succession was disrupted by violent upheaval**, leading to the decline of the age and the Immortals’ withdrawal. The human world temporarily lost the **Primordial Teachings (元教)**, and no divine-transformed gold existed as an ultimate elixir.

In the **Year of the Tortoise Shell’s Upper Primordial (龟甲上元元年)**, the Immortal **Lóu Jìng (娄敬)** instructed the use of **water sand (水砂)** to extract gold for elixir-making. He excavated **Yīn Mountain (阴山)**, mining silver ore and extracting **white gold**, causing immense labor for the people. Due to the **tyrannical rule of the worldly emperor**, the lack of harmony between ruler and subjects, and the people’s resentment, the **Dao was severed**, and the **teachings of life and death were disrupted**. The people fled to the plains, blaming the **Heavenly Dao**.

Afterward, when Immortals descended into the world, hiding among mortals, they gradually transformed society. **Divine gold (灵金)** emerged, and people came to enjoy medicines, valuing gold and treasures as mere dust. The world achieved great peace, and the people no longer resented the **Heavenly Dao**.

---
In the **Highest Antiquity**, when Heaven and Earth first divided, the **Five Phases (金木水火土)** had not yet aligned, nor had deceitful artifices arisen. People lived in simplicity, and the **Sages governed above**, the **Immortal Teachings** faithfully observed.

Later, **Huangdi established the calendar and the Five Phases**—though it is unclear who first systematized them in antiquity. Seeking the **ultimate elixir to save lives**, all claimed the **Three Sovereigns** had created it. At the time, there were no reliable records, and **green inscriptions (绿文字)** had not yet appeared. Later, those who attained the Dao relied on **seclusion from the world**.

The Immortals left behind **laws and teachings**, naming medicines and recording them in **verifiable annals**. Countless later practitioners refined and attained the Dao.

According to ancient records, **Emperor Míng (明帝)** first obtained the **ultimate elixir**, then passed the **Treasure of the Throne** downward. Eventually, it reached **Yu of Xia (夏禹)**. The **people’s desires were too hasty**; Yu did not await the **treasures of the feudal lords**, and though he benefited from the elixir, his reign was too brief to fully harmonize with the lords. Thus, the **Treasure of the Throne** passed to **Qǐ (启)**, and the **Imperial elixir tradition vanished from the world**.

Although many subjects attained it, they concealed their knowledge—some dwelling in the marketplace, others in secluded mountains and forests. Those who delighted in the Dao once glimpsed the **Ultimate Treasure**, yet it was not derived from earth, stone, water, or sand.

Later scholars must **know and recognize** it: the **Primordial Golden Transformation**’s essence. **True cinnabar (确砂)**—classified under *Similarity of the Ninth and Fifth*—has several forms:

1. **True cinnabar (确砂)**, whose origin lies in the **Yinshan Mountains**, where accumulated ice congeals into structured water, forming sand.
2. **Red true cinnabar (赤狙砂)**, bearing a reddish hue—whether aged or fresh, it benefits all things without harm.
3. **Cannon sand (炮砂)**, which people neither understand nor know its source; it damages substances and harms the body.
4. **White sea sand (白海砂)**, a saline sand resembling frozen seawater, found in the **glacial north** (绿北庭), resembling white snow, with an earthly taste like brine—thus named. It is **fit for ingestion** and serves as the **Ultimate Elixir**.
5. **Five Metals’ Thief (五金贼)**, so named because it **corrupts the Five Metals**. If used correctly, the metals remain unharmed; if misused, they are ruined. When applied in moderation, it yields strength—but overuse **destroys the body’s organs**, weakens the Five Metals, and brings swift death. This sand originates from **Poison Mountain**, where accumulated **yin-qi** congeals into its form. If forced, it must be withdrawn after formation; excessive use **guarantees death**, swiftly ravaging the **Five Viscera** and the Five Metals.

Those who grasp its **mysterious principle** and recognize **True Cinnabar** attain the Dao through its use.

---
**Pairing with Niter (口硝石)**—classified under *Similarity of the Fourteenth*—has four forms:

1. **Niter (硝石)**, the **Autumn Stone**, a **Yin Stone**, born from lands where **accumulated cold congeals frost**. This frost-earth is refined by boiling and distilling until it solidifies like **coagulated water**. Its applications differ: its **green nature** is cold, drawing **Kan-qi (北方坎子)** from the North, accumulating **yin** to subdue **yang’s toxicity**. Ancient Immortals used it to **refine substances**, transmute the Five Metals into treasure, and **forge the Dao through alchemical union**.
2. **Northern Emperor’s Mysterious Pearl (北帝玄珠)**, sourced from the **Northern qi**, transformed into a pearl of **ice-frost essence**, adjacent to **Cannon Sand** yet differing in application. **True Cinnabar** guides other medicines, while **Niter** subdues them—each possessing distinct natures. **True Cinnabar** is **yang-stone qi**; **Niter** is **yin-stone qi**.
3. **Aconite (乌头)**, named for the **yellowing autumn leaves** when frost first descends—symbolizing **withered grass**. Its variant,
4. **Yellow Aconite (黄乌首)**, is harvested when **ulcers face north**, its head **welcoming the frost**. Immortals used it to **counter Giant Yang’s great toxicity**, thus ranking it among **sacred Daoist practices**, opposing **saintly virtue** yet aiding worldly benefit when applied correctly—its **mystery lies here**. It **specifically treats women’s stagnant blood-qi**.

---
**Pairing with Orpiment (空青)**—classified under *Similarity of the Eleventh*—has three forms:

1. **Orpiment (空青)**, bearing a **feminine hue**, embodying **yin-qi** like the **West’s essence**—the **Regent and Xīn Metals (庚辛金)**, the **White Tiger’s qi**. **Green verdigris (曾青)**, by contrast, aligns with **Jia-Yǐ Wood (甲乙木)**, the **East’s essence**, the **Green Dragon’s qi**. Orpiment mirrors the **West’s Regent-Xīn Metals**, where **Wood-qi overcomes Metal**, yet it retains **Metal’s nature**. Though two names, their uses differ. **Verdigris subdues mercury**, acting as a **yang-messenger (使属阳)**, thus **masculine**. Orpiment’s **weak, hollow nature** earns its name, being **yin—feminine**. It **responds to verdigris’ qi**, enabling alchemical mastery. If **Orpiment is carelessly mixed** with other elixirs, it **fails to harmonize**. Once mercury is **fixed**, the **Three Yellows (三黄)** serve as messengers—but their union **becomes discordant**.
2. **Midriff’s Maiden (青腰中女)**, named for its **non-mercury qi**, blending with mercury yet lacking **Male Taiyang’s force**, hence its **feminine designation**.
3. **Green Sand (青砂)**, Orpiment’s **central hollow**, containing a **silver star**—a single grain, **pea-sized and green**, serving as the **Ultimate Elixir**. Ingesting it grants **longevity**. Also called **Mysterious Pearl (玄珠)** or **Mysterious Sand (玄砂)**. Without proper **alchemical pairing**, reckless labor yields nothing. The wise know that **Orpiment’s inner elixir** is **naturally formed**; Immortals who consume it **do not die**. Orpiment’s **silver star** is **yin—feminine**; **Verdigris’ gold star** is **yang—masculine**. It **commands mercury**, capable of **subduing the Three Yellows’ might**—the **secret technique**. The **Orpiment’s inner seed** is **heaven-born**, a **natural divine elixir**.

---
**Pairing with Sulfur (闷黄芽真性)**—classified under *Similarity of the Twelfth*—has four forms:

1. **Yellow Sprout Lead (黄芽铅)**, which **subdues mercury**, earning its name. The lead must be **unblemished by the Three Talents (三才)** to qualify. When refining mercury, it first **whitens**, then **yellows**, shifting through **Five Colors**, each governing a direction—only then does it **sprout**, fulfilling the **Great Dao’s function**.
2. **White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂)**, another name for **Yellow Sprout**. This **White Cinnabar Sand** is the **true embryo of Vermilion Ape (朱乌)**, its **skeletal essence** directly subduing mercury—marking the **initial stage of the Dao**, its power **transcending mortal limits**. It first **whitens**, then **glows yellow**, before manifesting the **Five Directions’ hues**, achieving **harmony (兑)**—the **Regent-Xīn Metals’ medicine**, transforming mercury into its **symbolic form**. The classics state: *"Extracting lead’s refined qi yields the **heaven-born sprout**."*
3. **Sulfur (硫黄)**, also called **Yellow Sprout**.

The **Sulfur (硫黄)** used to subdue mercury is indeed temporary—though it may dwell, it ultimately **flee**. If the **Ghost Flame (鬼焰)** is not severed, the **poisonous qi (毒炁)** lingers, and mercury remains afflicted. Even if one briefly **overcomes the fire (伏火)**, it is still **unbearable to ingest (不堪服)**, and only **treatments for illness (疗病)** may suffice. Different substances belong to distinct lineages—none can **prolong the dwelling (延驻)**; they will **harm in the end (终害人)**.

The verse says:
*"Heaven-born sprout (天生芽), White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂),
Uniting the two **qi (炁)**, as one kin (一家).
No deviation in the path (路不错), entering **Divine Transformation (神华)**—
The Dao lies here (道在此), this is the **River Vehicle (河车)**."*

The **Fourth Name: Lead-Yellow Flower White Cinnabar Sprout (铅黄华白丹芽)**—within lead, there is silver, hence its extraction by method. Obtaining silver’s **refined qi (精炁)**, it is called **White Cinnabar Sprout (白丹芽)**. **White Cinnabar Sprout (白丹芽)** is the **embryo formed by qi (炁结成胎)**, the essence of silver. Its **silver’s refined qi (银精炁)** subdues mercury as medicine, embodying the **Dao of Immortals (神仙之道)**. If used without harming the **Three Powers (三才)** and preserving its **qi-force (炁力)**, the verse declares:
*"Lead-Yellow Sprout (铅黄芽), perfecting the **Three Flowers (三华)**,
Extract my **qi (炁)**, forming the Sand (结成砂).
Initially white (初门白), refining fire (运火加),
Cycling the **Five Colors (轮五彩)**, rising like clouds and mists (起云霞).
**Green Vitriol (曾青)** as the agent—
The **Great Dao (大道)** knows no deceit (无邪),
With three complete, it is the **family of Immortals (仙家)**."*

The **Sprout (芽)**, born of **Heaven, Earth, and Humanity (天地人三才)**, is fully named as such. The **Sprout (芽)** contains the **qi of Heaven and Earth (天地之炁)**, giving rise to all **ten thousand forms (万类)**. Its root is **unbroken and continuous (绵绵不断)**, hence it is called **Sprout (芽)**.

**White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂)** is the **precious essence (宝精)** of mercury. When used to subdue mercury, it acts as **lord and minister (如君如臣)**—none can fail to **respond (相禀)**. Mercury, over **four thousand years (四千年)**, transforms into **Cinnabar (朱砂)**, then into **gold (金)**, and finally into **White Tiger (白虎)**, the **stone-fluid (石液)** of ages. Yet even the **Immortal Teachings (仙教)** often vary—when one attains its **form and spirit (形神)**, it too **shifts and changes (变改)**. Before it is named **True Cinnabar Sand (真丹砂)**, the **green mercury (绿水银)** remains unstable in nature.

Only **White Cinnabar Sand (白朱砂)**, called by Immortals **Primordial Origin Sand (玄元砂)**, endures **ten thousand years (万载)** without alteration. Its **Primordial White nature (元白之性)** differs from mercury’s. The **Sand (砂)** is like a **worldly ruler (世国主)**—though human in form, its **qi (炁)** differs from the common. **Life and death are in its grasp (生杀在手)**, and **transformation is in its mind (变化在心)**. So too with **White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂)**—only then does one know this **Sand (砂)** is the **Primordial Origin’s beginning (玄元之首)**.

None but those who **already possess Immortal Dao (宿有仙道者)** can obtain it by extraction. If alchemists wish to **attain the Heaven-born Sprout (天生芽)**, they must seek **Primordial Origin Sand (玄元砂)**—which is precisely the **Heaven-born Sprout (天生芽)** and **White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂)**. Near the earth it does not grow—it thrives in **distant mountains (远山)**. Mountains hold **Kān-Lǐ caves (坎离之穴)**, yet alchemists cannot penetrate deeply. To extract my **Primordial Origin (玄元)**, one must **fathom the unfathomable depths of the Sand (莫测丹之浅深)**. Only **Jinzhou Cinnabar (锦州朱砂)**, refined into **precious grains (成颗者)**, is taken—by method, its **qi is drawn (抽晕)**, then **restored to its original form (却归旧体)**. **Overcoming the fire (伏火)** without harming the **Dao (道)**, it is also named **Yellow Sprout (黄芽)**.

It **sequentially subdues mercury (递相承制汞)**—like **minister meeting sovereign (臣见君)**, like **fire encountering kindling (火见薪)**, like **wind meeting clouds (风得云)**—none fails to **be overcome (不伏)**. Yet after **completing the Sand (成丹之后)**, it **cannot be ingested (不堪服食)**. Some may **craft it for worldly gain (制为世利)**, or **偶然 heal ailments (偶以愈疾)**, but it **never fulfills transcendence (终无出世之功)**—this can be **verified (验)**.

After **one or two years (一二年)** of ingestion, **men’s yang pathways (阳道)** are **severed (俱绝)**—for **pure yin accumulates (纯阴之所积)**. Fellow seekers of the **Later Teachings (后学同志)**, follow only the **Ancient Teachings (古教)**. If one extracts this **Sand (砂)** and ingests it, **none will fail to attain the Dao (无不成道)**.

**Green and White Cinnabar Sand (绿白丹砂)** is the **medicine of nature (自然之药)**. The method **encompasses the Three Powers (三才)**—using **Heaven and Earth as the furnace (天地为炉)**, the **Four Seasons as fuel (四时为炭)**. **Passing through water and fire (经水过火)**, enduring **kalpas (劫)**, it **refines into substance (成质焉)**. Alchemists must know—**wondrous Dao is not distant (妙道不远)**.

If one obtains this **Sand (砂)** and ingests it, simply **removing impurities (去却夹石)**, grinding it into **powder (研炼如粉面)**, with **nine steams (蒸)** as the measure. **Grinding it a hundred times (研及百过)**, like **Indian ink (如缅)**, forming **pills with date kernels (枣禳)** or **rotten rice (烂饭)**. The **pills (丸)**, the size of **mung beans (蒙豆)**, are taken **one daily (日服一丸)**—never more. Its **qi (炁)** is as **ingested (如服)**.

After **one or two years (一二年)**, one may **attain transcendence (出世之功)**. Before **leisurely observation (闲观)**, it **differs from common folk (与常人不同)**. Its **refined light shines like the sun (精光耀日)**, its **qi (炁)** **naturally luminous (自明达)**.

The **principles of the Ultimate Dao (至道之理)** lie solely in **containing the essence and returning to the origin (含精返本)**, nourishing the **Divine qi (资神炁)**. Extracting its **true fluid (真液)**, restoring it to the **Primordial Ancestor (元祖)**, filling the **blood and marrow (填其血脑)**, one **naturally grows young again (老而复少)**, **withers and flourishes anew (枯而复荣)**. Thus the classics say:
*"Quicklime cast into charcoal fire (胡粉投炭火), its form destroyed, returns as lead (色坏还为铅).
Ice and snow plunged into warm broth (冰雪入温汤), dissolve and become the **Great Mysterious (太玄)**."*

Moreover, **quicklime (胡粉)** is **lead burned (铅烧成)**, and **refined again (再炼)**, it **returns to its lead form (却归铅体)**. **Ice and snow (冰雪)** are **water congealed (水结成)**, yet **warmth’s qi (温暖之炁)** restores it to **water’s nature (水质)**. A man **begins young (年少)**, but with **ultimate refinement (至精)** and ingestion, he **reverts to childlike vigor (返其童颜)**, **returning to youthful essence (还归少质)**."

This is the **earnest instruction (殷勤教谕)** of ancient sages to **fellow seekers (同志之士)**. It also **pities this age’s people (哀悯当世之人)**, who **covet life yet lose principle (贪生失理)**, **cut down by sounds and colors (夭枉於声色)**, **withered by tastes and flavors (衰悴於滋味)**—thus their **Primordial qi (元炁)** **gradually decays (渐衰)**, and the **Great Destiny (大期)** **approaches silently (奄至)**. Hence, I **diligently expound (孜孜着论)**, warning those of the **future (将来者)**.

My **Primordial Origin Great Sage (玄元大圣)** is the **Sand of Martial and Civil Dao (文武神化)**—nothing more than the **true nature of Yellow Sprout (黄芽真性)**—the **Teaching of Primordial Origin (玄元之教)**. Thus, the term **Yellow Sprout (黄芽)** cannot be **sought by will (意求)** or **mastered by method (法则)** alone. **Heavenly Immortal’s secret arts (天仙秘术)** were transmitted by the ancients—**only through oral instructions (口诀)** can one **sequentially learn (递递为师)**. Do not **recklessly reveal (轻泄)** these truths. Without grasping their **marvelous principles (妙理)**, do not **arbitrarily entertain strange thoughts (异端之心)**.

**Chapter Thirteen: Pairing the Sand with Lead—The Doctrine of Their Affinities (配合丹铅魂相类门)**
**Green Vitriol (曾青)** and **lead (铅)** are the **soul (魂)** of mercury.
Mercury is the **vital breath (魄)** of **Green Vitriol (曾青)**.

**White Cinnabar Sand (白丹砂)** and **Heaven-born Sprout (天生芽)** are the **heavenly soul (天魂)** of mercury—**without mercury’s vital breath (无水银之精魄)**.
**Sulfur (硫黄)** is the **wronged soul (冤魂)** of mercury—**concealing mercury’s wayward breath (隐水银之横魄)**.

**Realgar (雄黄)**, **Orpiment (雌黄)**, **Arsenic Sulfide (毗黄)**, **Niter (硝石)**, **Calcined Cinnabar (炮砂)**, **Great Yin Mysterious Essence Stone (太阴玄精石)**, **Void Green (空青)**, and **Alum (矾石)**—each **embodies qi to form (各禀炁成形)**—yet **none align with Immortal arts (都与仙术不合)**. Their **souls and breaths do not correspond (魂魄不相类)**, and their **Dao differs (道不同)**.

「If those who **embrace their affinities** (若相禀者),
their **strength** (力) does not surpass **lead** (铅),
their **command** (使) does not surpass **Green Vitriol** (曾青),
their **achievement** (功) does not surpass **water and fire** (水火),
and their **loss** (失) does not surpass **miscellaneous substances** (杂类).

**Green Vitriol** (曾青者) is the **essence of wood** (木精).
**Lead and mercury** (铅汞者) are the **affinities of metal** (金相类).

**The Three Souls** (三魂):
**Green Vitriol** (曾青), **First and Second** (甲乙), is the **first affinity** (第一), the **essence of wood** (木精).
**Maid’s Daughter** (姥女), **White Cinnabar Sand** (白丹砂), **Third and Fourth** (丙丁), is the **second affinity** (第二), the **mercury of the Vermilion Bird** (朱雀汞).
**Lead** (铅), **Seventh and Eighth** (庚辛), is the **third affinity** (第三), the **mercury of silver, gold, and Heaven-born Sprout** (铅银金水芽).

These **three colors** (此三色) each possess **divine transformations** (神化之功),
capable of **restraining mercury’s strength** (能制水银之力).
If one attains this **mysterious principle** (妙理),
then one will not **lose the Dao of Immortality** (失其仙道).

**Next is Sulfur** (其次硫黄),
also a **path of the Intermediate Immortal** (中仙之道).
Those who use it must **align its affinities** (使其相类) as **outer form** (表裹),
as **ministerial assistant** (臣佐),
and as **qi and force** (炁力).
If attained, one becomes an **Intermediate Immortal** (中仙),
but if not understood, one becomes a **deadly adept** (死士).

**Sulfur** (硫黄) has **great toxicity** (大毒).
One kind is called **common Sulfur** (凡常硫黄).
**Our Immortal Sulfur** (我仙家硫黄),
can **discriminate** (殊别),
and when **greatly applied** (大用),
like the **ministers of the Three Platforms** (三台之臣),
it can also **lead to transcendence** (有出世之路),
**transform the five metals** (化五金之功),
and possess a **separate method** (独行一门),
**saving the poor** (救贫之法).

The **scripture says** (经云):
*"Refine it to gold color (炼如金色),
and it can **transfuse stones into gold** (可以点输石成金),
without falseness (不虚)."*

When **greatly applied** (大用者),
it **assists in forming the Immortal’s divine elixir** (助成仙人神丹胎),
and **none can do without it** (无不用之).
To use it, one must **avoid ghostly flames** (无鬼焰).

**Green Vitriol** (曾青) shares **its fundamental affinity** (同本类) with **one color** (一色),
but **only possesses the divine transformation** (独有神化之功),
**drawing mercury’s qi** (引水银之炁),
**flowing and dispersing through the hundred meridians** (流散百脉).

If **practiced alone** (独行一门),
it can **transform the five metals into worldly treasures** (化五金为世宝).
When **used in its liquid form** (用化为液),
the **five metals** (五金) encounter it,
and **none fail to change** (无不变改).

**The mercury method** (水银一门):
**Immortal elixir—White and Vermilion Cinnabar** (仙丹白朱砂宝),
is **Heaven-born Sprout** (天生芽).
It **originates from mercury** (本从水银中生),
its **spirit unaltered** (精神不变),
and when it **forms White Cinnabar** (成白朱砂者),
it is then called **Heaven-born Sprout** (始名天生芽).
If one **attains this sprout** (得此芽),
**mercury will be subdued and transformed** (水银无不伏化).

Now, **Daoists lack Heaven-born Sprout** (今道士无天生芽),
so why not **borrow qi to form White Cinnabar Sand** (借炁而成白丹砂),
and thus **align with its grand transformation** (即同其大造化)?

**Ancient Immortals** (上古仙士) established the **Grand Transformation** (立言大造化),
using **Heaven and Earth as the furnace** (天地为炉),
and the **four seasons as fuel** (四时为炭).
If one **refines with pure and profound understanding** (纯妙用),
it also **aligns with the Grand Transformation** (亦同大造化),
and does not **need to seek distant models** (不在远取其则).

Yet, **the Three Ones must be mutually required** (然三一相须),
their **positions differ** (其居不同),
but their **purpose is singular** (其致一也).
If the **types and applications diverge** (若种类不同),
and **intentions vary** (用意参差),
then **divided into two paths** (分两有异),
how can one **understand and extract** (如何解摘)?
Only **my divine transformation secret arts** (唯我神化秘术),
**trust and follow** (信心所从).

**The Doctrine of Their Affinities: Divine Elixir Palace** (配合神丹宫相类门第十四)
**The Three Souls** (三魂):
**Mercury’s spirit and vital breath** (水银灵魄),
**form the three grades of Immortal elixir** (成三品神仙之丹).

From **the Three Ones** (从三一起),
**separating the Dao-principles** (分别道元),
**one generates two** (一生二),
**two generates three** (二生三),
and **three generates the Three Talents** (三生三才).
**The three elixirs align in affinity** (三丹相类),
**divine symbols like White Snow** (神符白雪),
**Nine-turned Golden Cinnabar** (九转金掖),
**from the ninth to the ninth** (从九至九),
**its liquid is unbroken** (液之不断),
and **unbroken is the name of qi** (不断是有炁之名).

**Accumulating qi to perfection** (积炁成功),
it **becomes the Three Palaces of Upper Clarity** (为上清三宫).
The **first is called Purple Cloud Palace** (一名紫霞宫),
the **second is called Heavenly Sovereign’s Jade Palace** (二名天皇琼宫),
and the **third is called Purple Hall** (三名紫宸官).

**Heavenly One Palace** (天一宫) **unites with the Divine Elixir** (合神丹),
and **its three grades of elixir** (其三品丹),
**all belong to one method** (都在一门).
**The three substances within the medicine** (药中三物) **coalesce to form** (共成),
**entering Heavenly One Palace** (入天一宫).
**Heavenly One Palace** (天一宫) is another name for **Heavenly Sovereign’s Jade Palace** (天皇琼宫之别名).

If one **refines the divine symbols for the upper elixir** (修神符上丹),
**beginning from the Purple Cloud Palace** (从紫霞宫起首),
**from yellow to purple** (从黄至紫),
**without losing its original hue** (不夺旧色),
then it **cannot be named** (不可载其名).

**Heavenly One Palace** (天一宫) is the **greatest**.
The **Three Palaces** (三宫) are the **realms of the Three Purity** (三清之境),
**from the void and formless Purple Cloud Palace** (从虚无紫霞宫天皇前),
**all things, great saints, converge** (一切，大圣悉皆归集).

If **worldly beings attain this true Immortal path** (世人若得此真仙之门),
**without mixing, they align with the Grand Transformation of Heaven and Earth** (不杂亦同天地大造化).

**The Great Dao** (大道者) is **Heaven and Earth** (天地).
**Ordinary mercury**, if **attained by Green Vitriol** (凡水银如得曾青),
**tested by fire and subdued** (以火试伏),
and placed **within the crucible** (而於鼎中),
its **spirit transforms into radiant brilliance** (其灵变光芒),
**fire burns without consuming it** (火烧不烬),
and it **becomes the Immortal’s elixir** (变成仙丹),
**responding to the true divine elixir of the Upper Immortal’s Heavenly Palace** (以应上仙天宫真神丹).

It is called **Emperor of Light** (号明皇元君),
**transformed from the Jade Morning Lord** (从玉晨君化成),
and its **name derives from the White Snow** (其名因白雪而成道).

According to **the *Scripture of Its Own Conduct*** (按《本行经》中载元始五老),
**the Five Elders of Primordial Beginning** (元始五老),
are the **highest revered by the Most High** (太上之尊).
Their **elixir** (其丹) **encompasses the wisdom of all Heavenly Palace saints** (上关天宫诸仙圣智),
**yet remains concealed within the human body** (下在人身中而伏藏).
If **known both above and below** (上下知之),
one may **name it the Great Dao** (可名成大道).

**The Doctrine of Their Affinities: Fetal Palace of Male and Female** (配合胎宫雌雄相类门第十五)
**Within the fetal palace**, **aligning elixirs** (胎中配丹):
**Sulfur and mercury** (以硫黄、水银) are **affinities** (相类).
**The Four Spirits** (四神):
**Realgar, Cinnabar Sand, Void Green** (雄黄、朱砂、空青) are **affinities** (相类),
and **lead, tin, gold, copper** (铅锡金铜) are **affinities** (相类).

**Miscellaneous elixir medicines** (杂诸丹药),
**combined with alum** (合以矾石),
and **herbal medicines** (并草药相类),
**yellow elixir and niter** (黄丹、硝石) are **affinities** (相类).

**Metal aligns with wood** (金合木),
**water aligns with fire** (水合火),
**qi aligns with wind** (炁合风),
**yin aligns with yang** (阴合阳),
and **all align in affinities to form grades** (并相类成品),
**uniting qi with Dao** (以炁合道).

**All miscellaneous elixir formulas and medicines** (凡所置杂丹方药),
**lack transcendental efficacy** (并无出世之功),
yet **temporarily possess healing abilities** (暂有治疾之能).
If one **mixes this alum with the Immortal’s protective qi** (将此矾石杂类),
and **mercury is used as the elixir** (染我神仙之卫),
then **though it may temporarily reside** (水银为丹者，虽尔暂住),
**it will ultimately depart** (终久还去).

Moreover, **mercury’s nature is inherently slippery and pure** (且水银性自滑净),
**untainted by dust or filth** (不染诸尘垢).
**Daoists** (道士) **should not seek its affinities** (岂不相类求象),
**to align with the Sacred Dao** (以合圣道).

For instance, **lead belongs to the North** (假如铅属北方),
the **Water position** (子，水位),
and the **substance of qi** (炁之质).
As the **fetal palace containing silver** (为含银胎),
its **silver fetus is yellow flower** (其银胎为黄花),
like **fire contained within wood** (如木中含火),
**seeking affinities and configuring qi of lead** (禀类相求，而配其炁铅).

The **white** (白者) is the **metal’s essence** (金精),
and the **qi** (炁者) is the **water’s foundation** (水基).
**Mercury internally contains the fire of harmony** (水银内含火熙),
symbolizing **fire within wood** (象木中含火).
**Water restrains fire** (水刑火),
**as the Wood position (卯) aligns with the Tiger position (寅) for fire** (为卯合寅为火),
called **Double Yang** (曰重阳),
with **fire concealed within** (火在其中伏藏).

Thus, the **Dao scripture says** (所以道经云):
*"Know the white and guard the qi"* (知白守炁).
**Qi** (炁者) is the **North position** (北方之位),
where the **lead’s essence resides** (铅精所居),
**the male** (为雄),
and **the male is lead containing silver** (雄者为铅中含银).

**Male aligns with female** (雄配雌),
and **the female is mercury** (雌者水银),
**whose nature contains yang** (体性含阳).
**Female and male mutually require** (雌雄相须),
**yin and yang unite** (阴阳相合),
**forming the initial medicinal method** (为药初门),
**transforming into White Cinnabar** (为化成白掖),
**subduing mercury and causing its death** (伏汞而死).

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"The common people use it daily, yet do not know its Dao."*

Water, the first of the Five Phases, alone can generate all things.
Does the Daoist not know the art of divine transformation within it?

The **male**—silver within lead—can transform mercury’s silver into **White Elixir**.
The **White Elixir** arises when the **male** and **female** mutually refine each other.

This is the **Immortal Pill**, the supreme grade of the **Mystic Teachings of the Upper Primordium**, named the **Divine Symbol Pill** in the *Five Symbol Scripture*.

Next, one uses **copper acetate (曾青)**, **malachite (空青)**, **realgar (雄黄)**, **orpiment (雌黄)**, **yellow arsenic sulfide (毗黄)**, **sulfur (硫黄)**, **saltpeter (硝石)**, **calcined sand (炮砂)**, **arsenic trioxide (戎盥)**, and **lead oxide (铅华)**—for **lead oxide** is another name for the refined essence of silver within lead. All these medicines assist in completing the **Dao**; they must be used according to their **resonant affinities**.

This aligns with the *Changes*’ symbols—never misapplied. When refining at the furnace, if the **Three Powers** are complete, the **Heavenly Dao** succeeds, and nothing fails.

As for the **Three-Grade Supreme Pill**, it does not use **saltpeter or alum** and their ilk. Yet in the *Harbor Passage Key*, the **Five Metals’ System** belongs to the **Worldly Utility Gate**, where alum must be used to **harmonize affinities**, making them **flow smoothly** and aiding the **Gate’s function**—omission renders it incomplete.

For **minor pills** treating **lingering fevers**, common folk mistakenly mix alum with mercury to assist in pill formation. They do not grasp **resonant affinities**, recklessly taking their roots. Even if illness temporarily abates, it is because the patient’s **fate** allows it—not the pill’s power. Such methods are **groundless**.

Why? The **Five Viscera** cannot absorb alum.

Further, in herbology texts, many prescriptions use **white alum** and similar substances. When fire-refined, they become **raw or cooked essences**, yet their **alum nature** remains unchanged. Just as **dead mercury** does not lose its **mercurial essence**, nor does **cooked rice** lose its **raw rice nature**. Only their **timing** differs—**raw** is **urgent**, **cooked** is **slow**. The **beginning and end of qi’s swiftness and slowness** are fundamentally the same. As a person ages from youth to old age, their **essence** remains unaltered.

Only our **Three-Grade Divine Pill** harmonizes **qi by affinity**, aligns **qi by category**, never strays from the **Five Phases**, pairs **yin and yang**, omits no **water-fire methods**, mirrors its **colors** without exceeding **束 (restraint)**, forms by **affinity**, and never departs from **south and north**.

It **receives qi** and **issues commands** in a **cyclical order**, never exceeding the **Eight Trigrams**. It **commands sinews and bones** without overusing **copper acetate**. It **refines yin-yang essences**, yet its transformations never exceed **lead, gold, and White Elixir**. Its **concealment** never surpasses **water and fire**, and its **fulfillment** never exceeds **water’s foundation**.

**Hidden in form**, it is **Divine**—**sulfur** is supreme.
**Yellow arsenic sulfide**, a singular substance, moves alone as **Heaven’s One**. **Hermaphroditic saltpeter** transforms **white to yellow**, then **yellow to purple**, all **affinitive substances** never straying from the **Divine Pill**.

Misdirected combinations **greatly err in the Dao**.

---
**Refining the Oral Divine Pill: The Sixteenth Gate of Affinitive Cultivation**

**First Divine Pill: Divine Symbol, Supreme-Grade Pill.**
Its pill is formed by **harmonizing qi**, becoming the **Great Pill**, named **Heaven’s Mirror**.
The **yellow bloom within lead** is silver, contained in lead, called **Yellow Bloom**—its **bloom-pool**.
The **bloom-pool** is **water’s foundation**, named **female**, which is **silver**, the **Western Planet’s White Star Constellation**, called **Regents Geng and Xin, the Young Maiden**—the **female**.
**Lead’s refined essence-qi** is the **precursor bloom**, named **male**—previously called **Yellow Bloom Lead**. This **precursor qi** can refine mercury, hence **lead’s refined qi** is its **central male**, of the **Northern Position**.
Paired with the **Western Lead’s male**, it forms the **bloom-pool**.
It aligns with the **Golden Young Maiden**, becoming the **male-female bloom-pool**.
Mercury, **shedding its form**, becomes **White Elixir**. When the **Elixir’s essence is pure**, it is **one qi**—**water’s foundation**, its position in the **Northern Child Trigram**.

**Second: White Snow.**
**White Snow** arises from mercury, used for the **Maiden’s function**. **Returning White Snow** aligns by **category**, merges with the **Dao’s original essence**, and all **qi coalesces into one**. It is also called the **Special-Mission Pill**.

Why does it require **varied flavors** to be supported?
Its creation is easy, yet attainment is difficult. Why?
Because the **first assistant**, **copper acetate**, is **Heaven’s One, Wood’s essence**.
**Yellow-sprouted lead essence**, **White Elixir’s gold essence**, and **Autumn Stone**—all **enter yin from yang**, drawing **Heaven and Earth’s qi**, passing through the **Dao’s true essence**. Once forged, it is **permanent**; no second effort is needed.

It is also called the **Gold-Sand Pill**. With **sun and moon’s successive addition**, **sulfur** is the **sprout**, **green waist** (arsenic trioxide) the **messenger**. When blended into **Gold-Sand**, a **surrounding mist** forms—named **Emerging Clouds and Mist**.
Obtained by **affinity**, it is taken without death.

The **Three Pills** align by **category**, each drawing its **qi**.
**Divine Symbol** responds to **spring and summer**,
**White Snow** to the **three autumns**,
**Nine Circulations** to the **three winters**.
Spring and summer belong to **yang—the male**.
**Lead’s yellow sprout** is the **Divine Symbol**.
Autumn and winter belong to **yin—the female**.
**Cinnabar and mercury** are the **Maiden’s White Snow**; **White Snow** is **yang’s cinnabar**.
**Nine Circulations** respond to the **three winters**—why?
**Divine Symbol** responds to **spring and summer**, when **heaven’s clarity** issues commands, **stirring all phenomena** to life, **responding to movement** and receiving **mandate**, aligning with the **four seasons** and the **eight nodes**. This is also the **Supreme Immortal’s Pill**, named **Divine Symbol**.

Next is **White Snow**, the **beginning of the three autumns**, relying on **chilling dew** to form **frost**, accumulating **yin-qi** into **snow**. It **checks and halts** (the heat), reducing all grasses to **ashes and dust**, while **movement retreats** into **earth-qi**. It is called the **Pill of Boundless Divine Transformation**, taken without death, its **creation** leaving **no trace**, beyond measure.

**Third: Nine Circulations.**
The **Nine-Circulation Divine Symbol** is also called the **Gold-Liquid Pill**, aligning with the **ninefold ninefold count**.

「**First: Nine Circulations.**
The **Nine-Circulation Divine Symbol** is also called the **Gold-Liquid Pill**, aligning with the **ninefold ninefold count**.

**Nine Circulations (of the Gold-Liquid Pill):**
The **Nine-Circulation** employs **sulfur** (硫黄), which is **Taiyang** (太阳). Using **yang** to generate **yin**, it is named **Pure Gan** (纯乾). **Pure Gan** forms the **Great Daoist Transformation Qi** (大造化炁), known as the **Nine-Circulation Pill**.

The **Nine-Circulation Pill** harmonizes the **Five Phases** (五行) and **Three Talents** (三才), obtaining this **Pill’s Daoist Symbol** to bind **Wood** (木), the **Wood Sovereign** (木王) now standing **Pure Gan**.

In the **midst of the twelfth month**, at the **true beginning of the first month’s node** (正月节), the **thawing spring** (解冻之春) marks the **Divine Symbol** as the **highest achievement**, the **Nine-Circulation Pill** as the **secondary achievement**, and **White Snow** as the **martial achievement**. The **Divine Symbol** is the **civil achievement**. Among the **Heaven-Earth Pill** (经天地), **spring** (春) is supreme, and the **Divine Symbol** has the greatest efficacy.

All **immortal’s protective arts** (神仙之卫) do not exceed these **three pills**. The **three pills** were created by the **Three Sovereigns** (三皇). Their pill-making methods are diverse, with myriad techniques, but those that fail to align in **rank and kind** (品类相配) are not recorded in the **Immortal’s Registry** (仙录).

The **Nine-Circulation Pill’s emissary** (使者) uses **Yellow God Glue** (黄神胶), the **White Snow Pill’s emissary** uses **Tianyi Sulfur** (天一黄芽), both being classified under **Yellow God Glue** (同黄神胶为一房). The **Divine Symbol Pill’s emissary** uses **lead with sulfur** (铅黄芽). These **three grades of supreme pills** (三品上丹) are distinct in their preparation; the **day of pill-making must not be mistaken**, lest the **immortal’s teachings** (仙教) diverge in kind.

**Failure to follow this kindred principle** (不涉入) is a **great error**. The **Seventeenth Gate of Aligning with Saltpeter and Sulfur** (配合传熙相类门第十七) involves **saltpeter** (硝石), **calcined realgar** (炮砂), **realgar** (雄黄), and **orpiment** (雌黄). These **four substances** are kindred in their **qi**, akin to general **subjugation techniques** (造伏), and can **refine mercury** (制水银) into **pill’s efficacy** (成丹之化). Their methods of **sensing qi** (感炁) are recorded in the **Key Gates** (要门).

Their **functions are distinct**, as **Heaven’s inherent categorization** (天生类别) dictates. For instance, **realgar** (雄黄) is kindred to **mercury** (水银) in forming **golden qi** (成金之炁), nurturing **gold’s essence** (辅金之苗), and producing **gold’s hue** (成金之色). When **cupric acetate** (曾青) is used as an **emissary** (使), it belongs to the **realgar kind**, forming **qi** in the same manner.

**Orpiment** (雌黄) is **yin**, assisting **void green** (空青). When **void green** is used as an **emissary**, it is also akin to **mercury**. **Saltpeter** (硝石) is the **minister** (臣), aiding **realgar, orpiment, and mercury** like **shutting and sealing doors and windows** (关闭门牖) to prevent loss.

They are akin to **one family’s members** (一家之人) or **one kingdom’s sovereign and ministers** (一国之君臣), without **barbarian or杂州** (四夷诸杂) interlopers, to **break the Three Talents** (破三才). In **all pill-making and protective arts of yellow and white** (黄白卫), one must not exceed these **four kindred substances** (四般为类).

**Calcined realgar** (炮砂) and the **Five Metals** (五金) must also **borrow qi** (借炁) for use. Their **dosage** must be known. If not aligned in kind, the **endeavor fails** (事不成). All **ten thousand things** (万物) follow this principle; it is not limited to **elixirs**. The **Gate of Refining** (修炼之门) succeeds when kindred substances are aligned.

**Beyond these four ingredients**, there are **others that intrude**, leading to **many contradictions** (非端多端). These are **not to be revealed** (未可闻命).

**The Eighteenth Gate of Aligning with Persian Lead** (配合波斯铅精相类门第十八):
**Persian lead** (波斯铅) does not harm the **Three Talents** (三才), becoming the **Five Pill’s Heavenly Mirror** (五符天镜), forming **my great pill** (我大丹), and serving as **Yellow Ke** (黄芽), the **highest law of the heavens** (毕天之上法). **Persian lead** is the **White Tiger** (白虎) **regal metal** (庚辛金铅), named **Western Country’s Yellow Ke** (西国黄芽).

**Lead from Jiayou** (嘉州铅) refined with **mercury** in **fierce fire** (猛火) until it turns **golden** is called **Yellow Ke**, bearing the **two characters: "Break the Three Talents, Divide the Gold"** (破三才分金公二字). It is also named **"Corrupt Nature"** (坏性), though it forms **Yellow Ke**, it is the **secondary law of the heavens** (日中天之次法), lacking the **Three Talents**.

**Persian lead** refined with **mercury** in **fierce fire** until it turns **golden** must be **a hundred refineries** (百炼) to achieve the **golden hue**, then it can be used for **transmutation** (点化).

**Adopted yellow flowers** (黄华) are used as **ke** (芽). **Transfuse and inject** (点输) into **stone** (石) and **realgar, orpiment, void green** (雄雌黄、空青), forming **Yellow Gold** (黄金) as the **treasure of the world** (世宝), also named **"Heaven’s Ultimate Law"** (毕天之法).

**Jiayou lead** (嘉州铅) and **sulfur** (硫黄), refined with **mercury** into **powder**, are used to **refine mercury** into the **Taiyi Pill of Contained Transformation** (太一含化丹), also named **"Central Heaven’s Law"** (中天之法).

**Jiayou lead** (嘉州铅) mixed with **sulfur** (硫黄) is **slightly consumed** (微微同销) into a **liquid**, using **greatest efficacy** (大功力). **Boiled in water** (水煮) for **a hundred days** (一百日), the **refining vessel** (盛器) yields **mercury** (成水银), which is also used as a **pill** (成丹用). The **Jiayou lead** is called **Hua Chi** (华池), refining **all mercury** into **substance** (成质), known as **True Lead, Golden Sovereign, Hua Chi Water** (真铅金公华池水).

**Persian lead** (波斯铅) mixed with **mercury** (水银), refined in **fierce fire** (猛火), yields **six liang of yellow flowers** (六两黄华). When **mercury is refined** (熟丹砂), it is the **yang elixir, Wood Essence** (阳药木精). **Stored in a cabinet** (柜中) for **a hundred days** (养一百日), **refined and purified** (修炼擎出), the **pills** are formed like **Firmiana seeds** (梧桐子大), to be taken **one grain daily on an empty stomach** (每日空心服一粒). Following the **regulations**, it **enhances the mind and spirit** (益心神), **sharpens vision** (明目), and **revives qi, beard, and hair** (炁髭发).

If **not taken for two hundred days** (不经二百日), **gray hair rejuvenates** (再炁), which is the **minor efficacy’s law** (小功之法). One knows that the **Dao of Immortals** (神仙之道) is **not false**.

**Jiayou lead** (嘉州铅) and **杂州 soil** (杂州土), refined into **powder** (为粉), **burned** to form **Yellow Pill** (成黄丹), also known as **Mieduo Seng** (蜜陀僧) or **Hufa** (胡粉). These are used to **make cabinets** (作柜子) for **subjugating elixirs** (伏丹药), serving as **gates for beneficial use** (堪为利用之门).

**Jiayou lead** (嘉州铅) can form **elixir silver** (炁银), **copperware** (铜器), and **extract copper’s bloom** (抽铜晕) to make **silver**. **Persian lead** (波斯铅) is **not used**; if **mercury is refined alone** (空炼) for **one subjugation cycle** (一伏时), **yellow flowers** (黄华) are taken to **refine mercury** (制水银), ensuring **no loss** (无不伏者).

**Refined alone for one cycle**, taking **yellow flowers** to **refine mercury** into **cinnabar powder** (成砂子). If it **endures fire in subjugation** (入火伏得住), it is also named **"Central Pill"** (中丹). For **great elixirs** (大药), **all leads are not used**.

**Song (Chant):**
*"Great elixir does not use lead,
Use lead and it must align in kind.
Align in kind and the Three Talents are complete,
Fail to align and things are ruined and shattered.
Yellow flowers all depend on lead,
Lead has transformations and changes.
Heaven and Earth are inherently complete,
Efficacy achieved and lead must withdraw.
Ultimate elixirs have no second or third,
Lead’s alignment brings them to completion.
Completion stems from the mind’s intent,
Intent requires lead and yellow flowers present.
Altering methods follow lead’s nature,
Without the Dao, success cannot be assured.
Assured is the Heavenly Mirror’s efficacy.
Lead-Yellow Pill,
The world also calls it Yellow Ke Lead.
Hufa,
The world also calls it Yellow Ke Lead.
For subjugating fire to make vessels,
To receive mercury,
It is also named White Gold, Yellow Ke.
**Jiayou lead**—one hundred catties (斤),
Refined into **two liang** (一两), **white as snow**.
Add **one liang of sulfur** (硫黄),
Use **one liang of mercury** (水银) refined by **water-flying** (水飞),
**Yuyu Grain** (禹余粮) and **Kong Gong Nuisance** (孔公孽) each **one liang**.
First, **consumed into liquid** (销成汁)."*

Then add the mercury, followed by the sulfur, then Kong Gong Nuisance and Yuyu Grain, stirring with the leftover bamboo branch tips.

Wait until they harmonize and emerge, then place them in a glazed stone basin and finely grind into a segment of purple powder.

Next, place it in a crucible, seal tightly, and refine with controlled fire for a hundred days, using no more than one *jin* of fuel.

After refining, remove and grind finely into powder, store in a silk pouch, and suspend it in an underground pit for three days before taking out.

Place it in a glazed stone container with rice, steam twice, then mix with human breast milk to form pills the size of *wu tong* seeds. Take one pill on an empty stomach.

Begin with wine as the carrier, increasing to ten pills, then cease, thereafter using saliva alone.

After a hundred days of ingestion, it will enhance complexion, thicken beard and hair, and even allow for fasting—this is a secondary Daoist remedy, though it does not lead to transcendence.

Why?

This green substance, though not of the formless kind, still contains within lead an unimaginable, boundless power, rivaling the Dao of immortality.

If one seeks to fast and nourish the body, or treat wind-related ailments, this alone suffices—no greater alchemical achievement is needed for worldly transcendence.

The **Persian Lead Flower Pool** can merge with verdigris, transforming the five metals into treasures of the age, acting as a singular agent.

The methods used are recorded in the *Secret Keys*.

But lead, when its Flower Pool is attained, can refine the five metals, subdue fire—if mastered, it harmonizes with *qi*, and when the proportions of the elixir are precise, it fulfills the grand transformations of Heaven and Earth.

Daoists must pay close attention, carefully studying these lead techniques, which encompass sixteen methods, aligning with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Those who master them become immortals.

Moreover, worldly wealth and even the ability to alter one’s appearance into that of a maiden emerge from this lead. Its power grants longevity and eternal youth, encompassing all the gates of Heaven and Earth—all derived from this.

But with the true method obtained, nothing remains uncertain.

Now, I briefly record these instructions.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Method of Lateral Qi Communication—The Gate of Resemblance**

The method of lateral *qi* communication relies on subduing the Three Yellows and the Eight Stones. One must not alter their original essence, allowing each to subdue fire.

When subduing fire, one must not let it consume or scorch—all this is due to the lateral use of *qi*, guiding *qi* back to its true nature, so that its fundamental essence remains unchanged. This is called the "subdued fire of the Three Yellows."

The methods for subduing these medicines are like the eclipse of the sun and moon: though temporarily obscured, they ultimately return to clarity, reverting to their original essence.

The methods for subduing the Three Yellows also require the power of saltpeter. Saltpeter is named Autumn Stone.

Why is it called Autumn Stone? Daoist practitioners of flying elixir must know its origin. The Autumn Stone—these Three Yellows—belong to the *qi* of Spring’s Grand Solar Yang, which is killed in Autumn; thus, saltpeter can subdue yang medicines. If one subdues the Three Yellows without using saltpeter, the yang toxicity will never dissipate.

The Three Yellows and Eight Stones all belong to fire, being pure yang *qi*. Their generation is akin to that of mercury, but mercury, when subdued by fire, becomes dry silver, retaining its original form. The Three Yellows and Eight Stones are all born of yang *qi*—how could one know their transformations?

But if one subdues the Two Yellows and Eight Stones without altering their original essence, their efficacy is boundless—this is entirely due to the power of Autumn Stone.

Thus, Autumn Stone is the sovereign of yang medicines. When using medicines, mastering their profound principles is like a sage ruler obtaining virtuous ministers. Autumn Stone is that minister.

The method for subduing saltpeter begins with obtaining white cinnabar stone, refining it with fire and water into powder, then using it to subdue Autumn Stone. Autumn Stone originally forms in cold, sunlit places, accumulating frost and ice to become white cinnabar—a product of ancient, congealed ice-earth, forming a white stone bed. From this bed, cinnabar emerges. Saltpeter, being of similar *qi*, is used in lateral communication to subdue mercury and cinnabar, preventing their essences from dispersing.

Thus, Autumn Stone is of the same primordial category. When subduing the Three Yellows and Eight Stones with it, the utmost yin can restrain and subdue them without altering their true form—this is due to the innate natures of these two medicines.

Next, sulfur is paired with Autumn Stone. Sulfur originally derives from saltpeter, inherently bearing a white hue. Though sulfur itself has not been subdued by fire, when paired with saltpeter and used in lateral *qi* communication, it strengthens the power of Autumn Stone and saltpeter.

**Chapter Twenty: The Gate of Resemblance—Pairing Methods**

Take Persian lead, which originates from the west’s *gēng-xīn* metals (iron and mercury). Lead contains gold, with its floral essence resembling the west’s *gēng-xīn* metals, while its substance resembles the north’s *rén-guǐ* water. Thus, ancient immortals recognized the floral essence of lead as the Yellow Sprout.

Yet those who extract only from lead’s exterior resemble *qi* of the same category in use—within one substance, gold and water are generated together. This is called "resemblance," referring to form and essence.

The *Yin Lord* and *Bóhé Master* explain: The *Primordial Teachings* of the Celestial Worthy originated from the Flowing Sands, where it was named "paired lead." Han Dynasty lead, though having floral essence, lacks purity, differing from the Flowing Sands lead of the Western lands. The Most High thus ordained the Flowing Sands lead as the true lead.

Obtaining Flowing Sands lead yields the Three Grades of Dan Gold, the first true lead of the immortals. The *Primordial Teachings* of the Mysterious Embryo are named Flowing Sands lead—this is Persian lead.

Its paired lead within is like a person possessing talent and skill—both are inherent, not outwardly displayed. Thus, according to the *Lingbao Five Talismans*, "The adept who does not return to the elixir embraces its pure flow; if the child obtains it, the True Person may be sought."

If lead is used without harming the Three Realms, it becomes the supreme medicine of Heaven. If it harms the Three Realms, its floral essence must be extracted. If its floral essence is extracted, the lead loses its *qi* and power. Though still taken from lead, it will never be true—unworthy to serve as minister or assistant.

Why is lead’s power incomplete? Because its original *qi* is lacking, and its true nature is impaired.

If the Three Realms remain whole, this is the supreme method of Heaven. If its floral essence is extracted, this is the secondary method of the Middle Realm. If used as an auxiliary, this is the inferior method of the Middle Realm. These three methods all stem from the sixteen gates of lead.

If one seeks to use them, one must clearly understand the Great Dao’s Primordial Teachings—without error—thus achieving the Three Dan methods, corresponding to the Three One Palaces. The Three Palaces are the Three Purities: Supreme Purity, Upper Purity, and Jade Purity, unified as the One Primordial Palace of Heaven.

The Three Dans must encompass the true natures of the Three Realms: lead, mercury, and sulfur. Malachite serves as a unique envoy, embodying the true nature of the Eastern lands. The East is the first of the four seasons, generating all things—nothing is untouched by its influence. Thus, malachite is the envoy of lead, the sinews and bones of mercury.

Like wood containing fire, it can make lead, mercury, and sulfur into the Yellow Divine Glue, providing the *qi* and power of ministers and assistants.

If one refines the elixir without understanding the principles of the Three Realms, recklessly using the Five Metals and Eight Stones, even if one achieves lead elixir, consuming five grains will turn one’s beard and hair white in ten days, making one’s face like a maiden’s. Though this may seem miraculous, it lacks the function of transcending the world and prolonging life—exhaustion leads to death.

But if the Three Realms are complete, and the elixir is refined with proper resemblance, consuming it will make one’s body eternal, with lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth.

Thus, since the division of Heaven and Earth, only the Green Waist Envoy was known. Later generations did not understand the Primordial Teachings’ transformations, nor how to extract the *qi* of the four seasons, nor how to draw upon spring, summer, autumn, and winter to form the Yellow Sprout. Unable to transcend the world, they lack even minor alchemical gates.

Nor do they understand how to borrow the Five Phases and Four *qi*, using furnace fire to transmute lead-*qi* into the Yellow Sprout’s pool.

For lead is the bone of the Yellow Sprout, lead powder its ministers, lead water its pool, and lead’s essence the vessel of the Five Metals. Lead’s function harmonizes with the Five Phases, entering sixteen applications—each distinct, yet within distinction lies the supreme treasure.

Lead belongs to the Right General, also called the feminine nature, or *yin*. It governs *yin* subduing *yang*—*yang* belongs to the Left, the masculine, which also generates the Three Yellows and Eight Stones. Yet its nature ultimately succumbs to *yin*’s subjugation, mirroring how a man’s essence spills into a woman’s womb—unaltered.

Thus, it is clear that *yang* dies under *yin*.

Hence, the world values preserving essence and safeguarding life—here lies the principle of medicine.

Yet the Three Yellows’ nature must be subjected to *yin*’s killing force, only then does it remain subdued and not dissipate, nor lose its original hue. Why? Because *yang* is ensconced within *yin*.

The world does not perceive *yin*-essence within the sun, as a man’s bond with his wife—constant in their union. This is *yang* being consumed by *yin*; when *yang* is established, it is met by *yin*’s subjugation.

The moon contains *yang*-essence, like a woman receiving her husband’s favor—devouring *yang*-*qi*, yet never parting. This is *yin* and *yang* responding, male and female merging in affectionate harmony, thus forming the Great Dao.

The sun is like a man—externally *yang*, internally *yin*.
The moon is like a woman—externally *yin*, internally *yang*.
The two *qi* interact.

Every thirty days they unite, each drawing the other’s refined essence to nurture all things.

The *Yijing* says: *"The meaning of *yin* and *yang* corresponds to the sun and moon."*
It also says: *"One *yin*, one *yang*—this is called the Dao."*
And: *"Suspended symbols, none greater than the sun and moon."*
All great elixirs are thus called sun and moon.

The elixir hymn states:
*"The Sage seizes the intent of Creation,
With hands clutching sun and moon within the furnace.
Subtly stirring the essence of Heaven and Earth,
Piercing *yin* and *yang* to move spirits and ghosts.
Who recognizes the sun’s soul and moon’s shadow?
Those who know are the Daoist immortals.
Refining and ingesting for a thousand days,
The body then lacks *yin*—how could death come?"*

Thus, the Three Yellows can be made into medicine only when subjected to *yin*’s killing force.

As when a woman bears a child for ten months—is it not nurtured within the *yin* womb to form its body?
*Yang* cannot generate without *yin*; *yin* cannot bear without *yang*.
The sun cannot shine without the moon; the moon cannot illuminate without the sun—this is the natural order.

When *yang* is exhausted and dies under *yin*, it is influenced by the Upper General’s power on the Right—the Upper, the Right. It governs subjugation.

Men’s pulses flow leftward; women’s turn right—thus, though mercury contains *yang*-*qi*, it is not yet free from the *Taiyin* body.
Lead, though in the *Renzi* position, does not lack the essence of Golden Flower. Metal and water share affinities, and with fire, they manifest.

Mercury is the essence of *Taiyin*, containing cinnabar within. Cinnabar originally transforms from the *yin* palace yet resides in the *Li* position, sharing lineage with lead, born in the Golden Flower pool—essentially one.

The *Huagai* symbolizes Heaven’s canopy over all things. Though dense clouds may not rain, *yin*-*qi* forms mist and dew, nourishing all things.
Lead’s *Huagai* nurtures and covers.

The White Tiger is the Golden Flower’s *yang*—its *qi* aligns.
All dragons are the souls of clouds; clouds are the canopy of rain.
Rainwater mirrors lead water, a dam against metal.
The tiger is the soul of wind; wind is rain’s messenger—each holds its primal essence.
This *qi*’s law mirrors the cosmos: imprisonment, death, decay, rebirth, and kingship lie within.
All things’ generation is governed by this.

Thus, ancient Daoist masters preserved the primordial scene of Great Creation, refining the Three Elixirs, exhausting a hundred liquids, achieving ultimate truth from the Three Primordials. Their transformations are recorded in Heaven and Earth, verified through analogy and evidence, gathering ancient Daoist texts to perceive the mysteries of immortality. They unified the Primordial Teachings, encompassing Confucian and Buddhist doctrines alike.

The Four Symbols establish Heaven; the Eight Trigrams found Earth. The Three Elixirs’ true principles interdependently reside within the Twenty Chapters.

Transmitted and practiced with precision, their essence flows without error—eternal principles, unchanging for ten thousand years.

For those refining the supreme medicine, ancient taboos must be observed. To repel ghosts, demons, and malevolent spirits, one must use analogous materials to forge potent tools, always kept beside the furnace. Shift their placement daily—these are the *Da Yao Bao Jin* instruments. Their use requires *gui ping* iron, forged white as a blade, one *chi* two *cun* long, or as short as five *cun*. If such iron is unavailable, pure steel suffices.

Next is the copper blade, which must bear the *yin-yang* symbols of dragon and tiger to be efficacious. It must never have been used before—for once employed, it cannot endure near the furnace.

All tools that govern *qi* must be forged from *yin-yang* materials. Other tools are ineffective.

Moreover, mercury and lead inherently embody *yin-yang* natures, merging to form their *qi*. Borrowing the essence of dragon and tiger, they guard each other—dragon and tiger are the substance of the Great Dao. Thus, malevolent spirits and ghosts dare not approach the furnace or cauldron.

This blade, when not in use, should rest beside the head, taken out once a year for purification with fragrant water, then polished and venerated. When refining elixirs, it patrols the furnace, driving away all evil spirits and instilling fear.

Yet it is known that the Great Dao uses tools to govern *qi*. Since the Primordial True Ones’ Three Elixirs are forged from metallic *qi*, the return elixir requires a metal tool to aid its completion.

The substances of like nature combine to form yin and yang—lead and mercury, the two names, both obtaining the essence of dragon and tiger. The Water and Fire phases never part; in all like substances, nothing fails to coalesce.

The Supreme Dao of Transcendence, within the *Secret Essentials of the Jade True One*, reveals its mysteries. The adept’s devotion—how could it not be manifest?

The Yin True Lord’s five metallic correspondences are now complete.
