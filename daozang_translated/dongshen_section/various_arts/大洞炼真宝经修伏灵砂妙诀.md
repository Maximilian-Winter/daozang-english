**Title:** *The Wondrous Secrets of the Great Cavern Scripture of Refining the True*
Composed by Chen Shaowei, a Daoist of Mount Heng during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. Recorded in the *New Tang Book · Treatise on Arts and Letters*. The author claims to have encountered a perfected being in the Yellow Dragon Grotto, who transmitted to him the essential secrets of divine cinnabar. He thus set forth the *Sevenfold Reversion Secrets of Divine Cinnabar* in seven chapters and the *Supreme Secrets of the Golden Elixir* in two sections, along with a preface and treatise. Later disciples divided this work into two parts, nearly two scrolls in total. Here, they are combined into one.

**Preface to the Wondrous Secrets of Refining and Subduing Divine Cinnabar**

Since the beginning of the Tianyuan era, I have wandered Mount Heng and sojourned in the Yellow Dragon’s abode. Suddenly, within a rocky cavern, I encountered a perfected and true being, who bestowed upon me the essential secrets of divine cinnabar.

The perfected one said: "I received this from Master Xu Juankun, who was taught by the Heavenly Master Wu. The Heavenly Master originally received it from the Realized One Ding of the same prefecture. The fundamental secrets of cinnabar elixirs are profound and abstruse in their mystery and principle, truly difficult to fathom. Thus, those who seek the Dao and aspire to the divine arts of the immortals, failing to penetrate their true origin, remain long mired in the dust of the world. Since ancient times, the transmitted scriptures have been veiled in obscurity, their words concealed, never disseminated among the world. I have long been moved by this. Now, I set forth the *Sevenfold Reversion of Divine Cinnabar* in seven chapters, along with the *Supreme Secrets of the Golden Elixir* in two sections, and compose this preface and treatise, to be shown to those of like aspiration in later generations."

**Treatise on the Sevenfold Reversion of Divine Cinnabar**

Cinnabar is the supreme essence of the Great Yang, the true embodiment of metal and fire. It harmonizes with the eight minerals and corresponds to the twenty-four qi. That which is called "cinnabar" is metal, transformed by fire, and thus named "cinnabar." That which is called "mercury" is fire, separated from metal, and thus named "mercury." Cinnabar receives the essence of Yang and awaits its fulfillment, while mercury departs from its original substance and its body is incomplete. Thus, cinnabar is the essence of metal and fire, coalescing into form, containing the true qi of the mysterious and primordial, the upright and pure. This is the foundation of the returning elixir, the root origin of the great medicine. When its virtue is contained, the myriad images arise; when its body departs, it becomes obscure and unfathomable.

The scripture says: "The radiant essence of Yang—obtaining it, one may restore the hun-soul and return the po-soul." Thus, it is known that consuming the essence of Yang grants longevity, while ingesting the yin po leads to death as a ghost. Cinnabar is the lord of the true Yang, the sovereign of the Red Emperor, enthroned in the south, the rightful position of fire.

Now, the forms of cinnabar are manifold, each receiving qi differently. Only three kinds are fit for the supreme medicine: the finest is luminous cinnabar; the middle grade is white horse-tooth cinnabar; and the lowest is purple divine cinnabar. Other varieties, such as river cinnabar and earthen cinnabar, are unfit for the supreme medicine or for ingestion.

One tael of luminous cinnabar is equal in potency to four taels of white horse-tooth cinnabar. One tael of white horse-tooth cinnabar is equal in potency to eight taels of purple divine cinnabar. The potency of river cinnabar and earthen cinnabar cannot be compared.

Some may ask: "If all cinnabar receives the essence of the Great Yang, why do river and earthen cinnabars differ in potency?" Luminous cinnabar receives the pure, clear, and luminous essence of the Great Yang, descending to coalesce into a radiant red glow—hence its name. White horse-tooth cinnabar receives the balanced and gentle essence of the Great Yang, descending to form a sparkling white luster like mica—hence its name. Purple divine cinnabar is half-formed by the numinous qi of mountains and marshes, its color a reddish-purple—hence its name. River and earthen cinnabars, however, receive turbid and impure qi, coalescing into a muddled, dull form devoid of essence—thus unfit for the supreme medicine.

For instance, refining one catty of luminous cinnabar yields fourteen taels, and through fire refinement, seven taels of the supreme treasure are obtained. Refining one catty of white horse-tooth cinnabar yields twelve taels, and through fire refinement, six taels of the supreme treasure are obtained. Refining one catty of purple divine cinnabar yields ten taels, and through fire refinement, four taels of the supreme treasure are obtained. Refining one catty of river or earthen cinnabar yields six or seven taels, and through fire refinement, only one or two taels of the supreme treasure are obtained. From this, it is clear that river and earthen cinnabars receive impure qi, mingled with turbidity. The wise and discerning first select the cinnabar, then regulate the fire, carefully attending to the process to achieve the seven reversions and nine returns.

Among metals and stones, none are as numinous, sagely, divine, or luminous as cinnabar. Carrying even one tael in one’s sleeve repels demons and evil spirits—how much more so when refined and ingested, entering the five viscera!

Now, the seven reversions and nine returns are different names for the same body. "Reversion" is cinnabar transformed into metal; "return" is metal restored to cinnabar. The scripture says: "Return to my homeland, restore my constancy—ingesting it, one ascends in broad daylight to the Jade Emperor."

Some may ask: "Is the sevenfold reversion cinnabar, belonging to fire, refined into metal, and thus called the sevenfold reversion?" The treatise states: The completion number of fire is seven. Seven transformations correspond to the ultimate embodiment of Yang. The seven transformations proceed as follows:

After refining cinnabar to obtain the subdued fire, it is smelted into white silver—this is the first reversion. The white silver is transformed to extract cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into yellow-flowered silver—this is the second reversion. The yellow-flowered silver is transformed to extract cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into azure gold—this is the third reversion. The azure gold is transformed to extract cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into yellow gold—this is the fourth reversion. [...]

The yellow gold is transformed to extract red cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into red gold—this is the fifth reversion. The red gold is reverted to extract cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into crimson gold—this is the sixth reversion. The crimson gold is once more transformed into cinnabar, which is smelted with subdued fire into purple gold. Upon reaching purple gold, it becomes the seventh-reversion numinous-cinnabar gold, replete with accumulated Yang and suffused with the essence of true primordial qi.

When purple gold is transformed back into cinnabar and refined with fire through one full cycle, it becomes radiantly translucent and luminous, called *Purple Gold Reverted Elixir*. Those who ingest it achieve the union of form and spirit, ascending lightly on the very same day.

Yet many in the world mistakenly take mineral sulfur, calling it the supreme essence of Grand Yang, and combine it with mercury to refine the seven reversions. Sulfur, however, bears the solitary Yang of mineral and stone, while mercury has departed from its original harmony—both substances are partial and imbalanced. How then can they yield a true and perfect treasure? I have observed that while many attempt refinement, none succeed in the end, for they blindly follow inherited errors down to later generations. I grieve deeply for this.

Consider, for instance, the first-reversion subdued-fire cinnabar: ingesting one *liang* dispels ten thousand illnesses; two *liang* turns hair and beard black; three *liang* brings a rosy complexion; four *liang* extends years and augments longevity. The second-reversion medicine, when taken in one *liang*, harmonizes the body and clarifies the spirit, reversing age to return to youth. The third-reversion medicine, in one *liang*, induces emptiness and detachment, uniting the heart with ultimate essence. The fourth-reversion medicine, in one *liang*, renders the body translucent, penetrating both exterior and interior. The fifth-reversion medicine, in one *liang*, enables one to enter water without drowning or fire without burning. The sixth-reversion medicine, in one *liang*, renders one unshaken by transformation and unknown to spirits. The seventh-reversion medicine, in one *liang*, elevates one beyond the Nine Heavens, roaming freely between heaven and earth. Further ingestion of the *Crimson Floret Ninefold Elixir* allows one to dwell in the Golden Towers, attaining the rank of Perfected.

Thus, the power of cinnabar is manifest and observable. Having grasped its true principle, I have long wished to aid others as an act of merit, illuminating the great Dao so that all may together return to the mysterious realm. Therefore, I composed the *Seven Chapters on Numinous Cinnabar* and the *Two Chapters on the Golden Elixir*, along with detailed accounts of fire phases, the sequence of medicinal substances, the hierarchy of chapters, and their respective categories—all arranged in subsequent sections to be bestowed upon the worthy and sincere.

Those of virtue who obtain these teachings must treasure them, for they bring boundless fortune and longevity. Those who recklessly divulge them shall bring calamity upon nine generations of ancestors. One must not deceive with false words nor obscure the Dao; take care not to transcribe and show them to the unworthy. Test the wise and the foolish, and only after discernment bestow these chapters.

*The Precious Scripture of Great Pervasion on Refining the True and Subduing Numinous Cinnabar: Wondrous Instructions*
*Composed by Chen Shaowei, styled Ziming, the Perfected of Mount Heng*

*Seven Reversions of Numinous Cinnabar*
*First Reversion: Cinnabar*

The Scripture states: Cinnabar is the lord of all numinous beings, the root of creation and transformation, the foundation of spirit and illumination. Dwelling in the Ninefold Purity, it governs and commands all through the Mysterious Pervasion. When moved, it ascends in its lofty form; when stabilized, it achieves the perfection of Qian. Capable of transformation, it is thus named the Crimson Dragon. When soaring, it is called the Vermilion Bird.

The finest grade is born in the stone caves of Chen and Jin, appearing in several colors. The middle grade grows in Jiaozhou and Guizhou, also in several varieties. The lowest grade originates in Hengzhou and Shaozhou, with numerous types and classes. All differ in purity and turbidity, their true or spurious nature distinct, their descending qi and refined essence resonating with metals and stones. Those that receive the upright qi, when ingested, harmonize with the profound and unite with the true, becoming the highest attainment. Those that receive partial qi, when ingested, also attain longevity and remain in the world.

Moreover, the finest luminous cinnabar emerges from the mountains and stones of Chen and Jin, atop the white Jiaoshi lungs, twelve pieces forming a seat, their color like an unopened red lotus, radiant and sunlike. There are also seats of nine, seven, five, three, or one piece. Those of twelve or nine pieces are most potent; those of seven or five pieces are next in efficacy. Within each seat, there is one large pearl weighing over ten taels, serving as the sovereign. Surrounding it are smaller ones, also weighing eight or nine taels, or even six or seven taels, acting as ministers in attendance, paying homage to the central sovereign. On the four sides of the seat, there are one or two *dou* of miscellaneous cinnabar, encircling the jade seat and the cinnabar lungs. From this miscellaneous cinnabar, one may select pieces shaped like hibiscus buds, fully formed; when placed on red silk at night, their luminosity penetrates through—these also belong to the finest grade.

There is also a type resembling horse teeth, with a white exterior and floating radiance—this is the finest white horse-tooth cinnabar. Another, like mica flakes with white light, is the middle-grade white horse-tooth cinnabar. Those round and elongated, resembling laughter, with a red-purple hue, are the finest purple numinous cinnabar. If they resemble stone flakes with angular edges and emit a greenish light, they are the lowest-grade purple numinous cinnabar, such as those from Jiao and Gui. However, if found in seats or within stones, shaped like hibiscus buds and luminous, they also belong to the finest grade. If formed in clusters of three or more pieces, weighing a *jin* and translucent, they are of the middle grade. Those in fragments, clear and bright, are of the lowest grade, like those from Heng and Shao. All purple cinnabar, or that extracted from stones with a red glow, are also of the lowest grade. River cinnabar, formed in granules and translucent, when refined and ingested, also grants longevity and permanence in the world, though it does not elevate one to the rank of highest immortality.

Cinnabar born in earthen caves and river cinnabar nurtured in the soil and water of streams, mixed with earth and stone, are unsuitable for use in superior medicinal preparations. The seat-born cinnabar is the finest of all. Obtaining one sovereign piece from the center of the seat, refining it, and incorporating it into the five viscera brings immediate merit, elevating one to the Upper Terrace of Cinnabar. With upright qi ever abiding, one transcends all entanglements. Further ingestion through the seven reversions and nine refinements naturally dissolves the corporeal soul, annihilates the mortal form, purifies the spirit-body, and entirely dispels yin qi. Thus, one embraces form yet ascends lightly, forever becoming a flying immortal of the highest truth.

Thus, it is known that the true essence of yang descends as qi, its round radiance complete and without partiality or deviation. Any refined cinnabar shaped like a hibiscus bud, with round and penetrating luminosity, is of the finest grade—the elixir ingested by divine immortals.

The Scripture states: Cinnabar is the natural reverted elixir. The world cannot fathom its origin. Even the cinnabar of the jade seat is known to all, such as the gold seat and the celestial seat. These are the cinnabar of the Supreme Purple Dragon and Mysterious Flower, not to be seen or known by common folk or ordinary men. The jade seat is for scholars and aspirants who accumulate merit and refine themselves through practice; its ingestion leads to immortality. The gold seat is for those with innate immortal bones, who cultivate emptiness and refine the spirit, dwelling in mountain caves. When immortals gather and consume it, they ascend and transform on the very same day. The celestial seat is reserved for the true officials of the Supreme Heavenly Immortals; its collection and ingestion are not the province of lesser immortals.

The cinnabar of the jade seat, having received the pure essence of six thousand years of yang numinosity, transforms into the gold seat. The gold seat is golden, with five pieces growing in layers at its center, surrounded by forty or fifty small pearls. After sixteen thousand years, it transforms into the celestial seat. The celestial seat is jade-green, with nine pieces growing in layers at its center, encircled by seventy-two pieces. It resides in the boundless void, perpetually guarded by the spirit of the Great One. On the day of the Upper Prime, true officials descend to gather it. The mountain suddenly opens, its radiance illuminating all, the entire mountain aflame. The cinnabar of the celestial seat is collected by true officials; later generations cannot obtain or gather it.

Thus, the origin of cinnabar is profound and remote. For those of lofty aspiration who yearn for light ascent, it is essential to discern the grades of the elixir, then regulate the fire phases, harmonize yin and yang, and refine it naturally to unite with the highest truth.

**On the Refinement of Yin and Yang and the Secrets of Fire Phases**

The Scripture states: Yang essence is fire; yin essence is water. The refinement of yin and yang entails the mutual restraint of water and fire. Thus, it is known that ice and charcoal cannot coexist, and decline and flourishing ultimately find their resolution. Moreover, cinnabar is yang essence and requires yin to restrain it; the restraining agent is water. One should use azurite, malachite, *shicheng*, *mayaxiao*, *xuanjing*, and *huashi*. For one *jin* of luminous jade-seat cinnabar, refine it with four *liang* of azurite, six *liang* of *shicheng*, six *liang* of *mayaxiao*, and two *liang* each of *huangjing* and *huashi*.

For one *jin* of externally luminous cinnabar, refine it with five *liang* of azurite, four *liang* each of halite and *mayaxiao*, and one *liang* each of *huangjing* and *huashi*. For one *jin* of white horse-tooth cinnabar, use three *liang* each of *shicheng* and *mayaxiao*, and three *fen* each of *huangjing* and *huashi*. For one *jin* of purple spirit cinnabar, refine it with four *liang* of malachite, two *liang* each of *shicheng* and *mayaxiao*, and two *fen* each of *huangjing* and *huashi*. For cinnabar of inferior quality from riverbeds and mixed soils, refine each *jin* with four *liang* of azurite and two *liang* each of *shacheng* and *mayaxiao*.

Grind *shicheng* together with *huangjing* and *huashi* into fine powder, place it in a cauldron, and nurture it with gentle fire for one day until it melts into liquid. After it has liquefied, mix in *mayaxiao* and heat intensely until it turns red. Then, use *shacheng*: first melt it three times into liquid before employing it.

For larger pieces of luminous cinnabar, crush them to the size of sesame seeds, then place them in an earthen crucible. Add malachite, *shicheng*, and *mayaxiao* with water, and boil vigorously day and night for thirty days without extinguishing the fire. Once the time is complete, wash and settle the cinnabar. Place it in a crucible, refining it with yin and yang fire phases; the crucible should hold one *sheng*.

There are five types of crucibles: the first is the golden crucible, the second the silver crucible, the third the bronze crucible, the fourth the iron crucible, and the fifth the earthen crucible. Place the cinnabar in the crucible and refine it with yin and yang fire phases.

**Method of Refining with Fire Phases**
The formula states: five days make one phase, three phases make one qi, and eight qi—twenty-four phases—complete in one hundred twenty days, at which point the cinnabar is fully refined by fire. For each refinement phase, deduct five days: four days use the *kan* trigram, and one day uses the *gao* trigram. The *kan* trigram entails boiling with water for four days, while the *gao* trigram entails refining with yang fire for one day.

Begin with yang fire, using seven *liang* of charcoal arranged vertically beneath the crucible, keeping the base of the crucible heated. Use exactly seven *liang* of charcoal, neither increasing nor decreasing. After each cycle, add one *liang* of charcoal for the next refinement. After five cycles, black vapor and mercuric frost may emerge; collect the frost and mix it with half a *qian* of melted *shicheng*, grinding it lightly in a mortar with a jade pestle until the mercury is fully absorbed. Then, return it to the crucible and refine it again with *kan* and *gao* fire phases.

After twelve cycles, add two *liang* of charcoal for each subsequent cycle. Add one *fen* of melted halite as powder on the surface, with about two *liang* of mercuric frost. When the frost flies out, the crucible will appear empty and luminous, and the elixir’s color will gradually turn yellowish-purple. Collect the frost and mercury, mix them with one *qian* of halite, and grind thoroughly in a mortar. Return it to the crucible and refine it again with the previous fire phases.

After eighteen cycles, add three *liang* of charcoal; the elixir’s color will turn red. After twenty cycles, add four *liang* of charcoal for each subsequent cycle. When only half a *liang* or less of mercuric frost remains, it will fly out as hard as blue-gold flakes, radiant with yellow and white luster. Mix it with *shicheng*, grind in a mortar, and return it to the crucible for further refinement. After twenty-four cycles, the cinnabar is fully refined, its color a brilliant red, resplendent to behold.

Once the cinnabar is refined, wrap it in salt flowers, seal it tightly with yellow clay, and place it in a yang furnace. Heat it vigorously for thirty days, then remove the cinnabar and place it in a bamboo tube. Seal the opening, submerge it in cold spring water, and bury it for thirty days before washing and grinding. The lighter portion may be separated for ingestion, while the heavier portion is melted into golden liquid.

When superior luminous cinnabar is refined, its color becomes a vivid red, and after washing and settling, six *liang* of golden-star cinnabar remain, gleaming brilliantly. When medium-grade white horse-tooth cinnabar is refined, its color turns a bright red, yielding four *liang* of golden-star cinnabar. When inferior purple spirit cinnabar is refined, its color becomes a reddish-purple, yielding three *liang* of golden-star cinnabar. For cinnabar of mixed riverbed soils, though its color may turn reddish-purple after refinement, it lacks luster and yields no golden-star cinnabar.

Since ancient times, immortals have refined and ingested true cinnabar to attain the Dao. The finest luminous cinnabar is indeed the true cinnabar. Those of wisdom must carefully select its essence to successfully compound the divine elixir.

After refining cinnabar in cold spring water, proceed to melt and forge it to reveal its true treasure.

**Method of Melting and Forging**
The formula states: for each *liang* of refined cinnabar, use half a *liang* of salt flowers. First place the salt flowers at the bottom of the cauldron, then add the refined cinnabar. Once the cauldron and cinnabar are uniformly red-hot, forge it a thousand times until golden liquid flows out, called "white silver," while the surface displays a moist, lustrous yellow bloom, radiant beyond description. This is the most authentic treasure of heaven and earth.

For ingestion, divide one *liang* into three hundred sixty pills, mixing them with jujube pulp. Take one pill daily, consuming one *liang* over a year. Before ingesting these cinnabar pills, one must purify and fast for seven days. At dawn, face east with reverence, sincerely invoking the Three Pure Ones, the Perfected Lord of Purple Tenuity, the True Person of Grand Unity, the immortal officials of former masters, and the spirits of water and fire. Request that this divine cinnabar elixir enter the five viscera, eternally preserving form and spirit to unite with the highest truth.

After the invocation, perform seven bows, then ingest the pill. After taking this cinnabar elixir, one must not consume putrid, stale, or accumulated foods, nor any raw or bloody pork, nor witness the impurities of life and death.

Thus the scripture states: "Yang essence delights in purity, while the yin corpse delights in filth." One must constantly empty and harmonize the will, purify and cleanse the form, to assist the true qi of the numinous yang. Naturally, the spirit will rejoice and the body will be clear, and the attainment of immortality may then be realized.

**Second Reversion: Precious Cinnabar**
The scripture states: "Those who refine the true unite with the utmost subtlety; those who refine cinnabar unite with the utmost numinosity; those who refine the numinous unite with the utmost spirit; and those who unite with the utmost spirit unite with the Dao. When the Dao is united, one ascends to Jade Clarity and becomes a lofty immortal. Now, refining cinnabar to obtain the precious is the medicine of utmost truth; transforming the precious to generate cinnabar is the wondrous elixir of profound resonance."

**Method for Transforming the Precious to Generate Cinnabar:**
Take four *liang* of white silver from the cinnabar and fashion it into a crucible, placing it within a glazed oil jar that holds one *sheng*. The precious crucible should match the size of the jar’s base. First, take one *liang* of Beiting cinnabar, one *liang* of *shi jian*, and one *fen* of *qilin jie*, grind these three ingredients together, and mix them with bitter wine into a paste. Coat the crucible on all sides, ensuring the medicine is fully applied, then let it dry. Encase it in yellow clay mud to a thickness of one *cun* and two *fen*. Heat it in a husk fire for three seven-day periods, then with white charcoal and a martial fire for two seven-day periods. Remove the mud to retrieve the precious crucible, place it in the jar, and add four *liang* of true mercury—mercury extracted from cinnabar of the same origin, called "the method of kindred resonance that transforms and generates cinnabar." The reason the scriptures of the perfected immortals keep this secret is due to this mother-and-child method, lest the hearts of the vulgar and foolish come to know it.

After adding the true mercury to the jar, pour in five *ge* of water, ensuring the jar always contains five *ge* of water without fluctuation. Nurture it with a civil fire for two seven-day periods, until it boils like fish eyes. After the days are complete, add another four *liang* of mercury, and continue nurturing with a civil fire for one seven-day period, then let it dry. Seal the mouth tightly and apply a martial fire to press it for three days. Red and yellow cinnabar will surge forth upon the precious crucible. Collect the cinnabar and replenish the mercury as before. Always maintain eight *liang* of mercury in the jar, neither increasing nor decreasing, and continue using civil and martial fires to nurture and press, generating cinnabar. Collect the cinnabar as it emerges. For every four *liang* of the precious, one *jin* of cinnabar is obtained. The precious will then wither, become brittle, and its essence will be entirely transformed into cinnabar. Only two *liang* of bluish-black ash will remain in the jar.

Take the cinnabar and, following the previous method, boil it with medicinal ingredients for thirty days. Then wash and retrieve the cinnabar, place it in the tripod, and refine it with yin-yang fire cycles—five days per cycle, twenty cycles in total, completing one hundred days. The cinnabar will then be subdued by fire. The amount of charcoal used in the fire cycles should follow the previous method. Once the cinnabar is subdued, do not use it directly; instead, wrap it in salt and heat it to melt and forge. The forging method also follows the previous section. Use salt as the agent to guide the flow of golden liquid. From one *jin* of this precious cinnabar, fifteen *liang* are obtained through refinement. When subdued by fire and forged, thirteen *liang* of yellow-flower silver are produced, its color gradually turning golden with a lustrous sheen, white within and yellow without—this is called yellow-flower silver.

If this cinnabar is to be ingested, it must first have its fire toxin drawn out by cold springs. The cold spring method involves burying it deep in the earth for thirty days, then retrieving, washing, and grinding it. Mix it with jujube pulp to form pills, making three hundred sixty pills per *liang*. Each day at dawn, face east with reverence and sincerely ingest one pill. After taking this precious cinnabar elixir, one’s thoughts will naturally become tranquil and the spirit clear; turbid qi will not enter, and the will shall not be disturbed. Thus, one gradually ascends the steps toward immortality.

**Third Reversion: Florid Cinnabar**
The scripture states: "When yang’s primordial energy accumulates through practice, the florid qi naturally converges with true essence. When true essence resonates and transforms, the divine elixir may be attained." Thus it is said: "Refining the true to attain the true, the true essence responds universally, transforming into the mysterious cinnabar of golden floridity."

**Method for Transforming Precious Cinnabar into Florid Cinnabar:**
Take four *liang* of yellow-flower silver from the precious cinnabar and fashion it into a crucible, following the previous method to match the size of the jar’s base. Use one *liang* of Pu Prefecture chalcanthite, one *liang* of *shi jian*, and one *liang* of processed cinnabar. Grind these with bitter wine into a paste and coat the crucible on all sides, ensuring the medicine is fully applied. Let it dry, then wrap it in yellow clay mud and heat it in a husk fire for two seven-day periods. Afterward, use white charcoal and a martial fire to heat it for one seven-day period. Remove the mud and retrieve the crucible. Following the previous method, place it in a glazed oil jar, add four *liang* of true mercury and five *ge* of clear water, and nurture it with a civil fire for two seven-day periods. Then add another four *liang* of mercury and nurture it with a civil fire for one seven-day period. Once dry, seal it tightly and apply a martial fire to press it for one day. The cinnabar will surge forth upon the precious crucible, radiant in red and yellow, its brilliance indescribable. Collect the cinnabar and replenish the mercury. When one *jin* of cinnabar is obtained, the quantity is sufficient.

Place the cinnabar in the tripod and refine it with fire cycles as before—five days per cycle. For the first three days, use the *kan* trigram, boiling with water for three days. For the next two days, use the *qian* trigram, flying with yang fire for two days. Initially, use seven *liang* of charcoal for the yang fire. After each cycle, increase the charcoal by two *liang*. After seven cycles, two *liang* of mercury frost will fly out, its color a radiant yellow, clustered with purple light, adhering to the underside of the tripod’s lid. Collect the frost in a bowl, add one *qian* of Pu Prefecture chalcanthite, mix it with bitter wine and cinnabar, and grind it thoroughly with a jade pestle until fully incorporated. Then return it to the tripod for further refinement.

After the sublimation process completes eighteen phases over ninety days, the refined cinnabar will have fully undergone fire-taming without the slightest loss. It may then be smelted and cast. Following the previous method, use saltpetre as a flux to stir the melt, and the precious essence will flow forth—lustrous with azure brilliance, called "Azure Gold." Azure Gold arises as yang essence gradually coalesces, emerging from *dui* to manifest in *zhen*, then cycling through *kun* to return to *li*, marking the full circuit of yang essence’s transformation.

If this refined cinnabar is to be ingested, first take half a *liang* of elm seeds and two *liang* of raw licorice, decoct them to extract the juice, and boil the cinnabar in a silver vessel for fourteen days. Afterward, strain the cinnabar, place it in a pale green bamboo tube, and bury it deep in the earth for thirty days. Upon retrieval, mix it with jujube pulp to form pills, dividing each *liang* into three hundred sixty. Each morning at dawn, face east, invoke the Three Pure Ones and the Immortal Officials, and then consume the pills. By ingesting this refined cinnabar elixir, one’s cravings and desires will fade, meat and blood will no longer pass the lips, and dwelling in quietude, the spirit will harmonize while the body grows light—gradually attaining fellowship with the Perfected.

**Fourth Return Elixir: Wondrous Transmuted Cinnabar**
The scripture states: The *qian* body radiates yang brilliance, its pure essence gradually clarifying. *Gen*’s snow is light and fresh, dissolving the yin spirit. Thus, the Azure Gold’s essence interacts with mercury to generate cinnabar, their vital energies intertwining to form the wondrous—called "Wondrous Transmuted Cinnabar."

**Method for Wondrous Transmuted Cinnabar:**
Take four *liang* of Azure Gold and forge it into a crucible capable of holding four *ge*. Mix half a *liang* each of red salt, sulfur, *da peng* cinnabar, and one *liang* each of *Bei Ting* cinnabar and Pu Prefecture chalcanthite with bitter wine, grinding them into a paste. Coat the Azure Gold crucible inside and out, then heat it gradually until the medicine is fully absorbed. Once dry, encase it in yellow clay as before, sealing it in a ball. Fire it with chaff for fourteen days, then with white charcoal under strong fire for another seven. Upon completion, remove the clay, extract the crucible, and place it in a flask with four *liang* of pure mercury and five *ge* of water—no more, no less. Nurture it for fourteen days, then add another four *liang* of mercury. Continue with gentle fire for seven more days until dry, seal it tightly, and apply strong fire for one day. The wondrous cinnabar will surge forth, yielding four *liang*. Collect it, add another four *liang* of mercury, and repeat the gentle-fire nurturing until cinnabar forms. Once a total of one *jin* is gathered, the quantity is sufficient.

Place the cinnabar in the tripod and refine it with fire cycles as before—five days per cycle. For the first two days, use the *kan* trigram, boiling with water for two days. For the next three days, use the *qian* trigram, flying with yang fire for three days. Follow the fire regimen and charcoal increments as described in the refined cinnabar section. After sixteen phases over eighty days, the wondrous cinnabar will have fully undergone fire-taming, its golden stars gleaming with radiant red brilliance—truly the most refined and wondrous cinnabar.

For smelting and casting, use saltpetre as a flux to induce the golden liquid to flow, forming yellow gold. As the gold solidifies, its hue deepens, lustrous and luminous, its pure essence gradually manifesting. Thus, the scripture states: "From yin, it returns to yang; from turbidity, it returns to clarity." This is the transformation of yang’s primordial essence, merging with the truly wondrous to attain immortality.

If ingesting, first take half a *liang* of elm seeds, one *liang* of raw licorice, and one *liang* of purple fluorite, decoct them to extract the juice, and boil the cinnabar in a precious vessel for fourteen days. Then place it in a pale green bamboo tube and bury it in a cold spring for thirty days. Upon retrieval, mix it with jujube pulp to form pills, dividing each *liang* into three hundred sixty. Each morning at dawn, consume one pill. Daily ingestion of this wondrous cinnabar will gradually sharpen the mind, dispel turbid qi, and refine the body and spirit to purity, merging with the Perfected and transcending the mortal realm. For those of resolve who grasp the secrets of primordial essence refinement, the Dao of immortality is within reach.

**Fifth Return Elixir: Spirit Cinnabar**
The scripture states: Yang virtue spreads its merit and radiates light, moving its primordial essence. Primordial essence flows and transforms into refined cinnabar, which in turn enters the wondrous. The wondrous qi refines further to generate myriad spirits. Thus, the profound and wondrous attainments of the sages grow ever more luminous, resonating with true essence to naturally manifest spiritual transformation.

Spirit Cinnabar arises from the yellow gold within the wondrous cinnabar, interacting with mercury to generate its essence—flaming red with dazzling golden stars, its crimson hue pure and ethereal.

**Method for Spirit Cinnabar:**
Take eight *liang* of yellow gold from the wondrous cinnabar and forge it into a round tripod capable of holding four *ge*. Use two *liang* of gold for the lid. Inside the tripod, place half a *liang* each of sulfur, red salt, *Bei Ting* cinnabar, and Pu Prefecture chalcanthite. Mix them with bitter wine and grind into a paste, coating the interior of the tripod and lid evenly until the medicine is fully applied. Once dry, encase it in yellow clay, forming a one-*cun*-thick layer. Nurture it with gentle fire on all sides for fourteen days, ensuring it is too hot to touch. After fourteen days, gradually increase to strong fire with white charcoal for another seven, maintaining the flame day and night. After seven days, let it cool, remove the clay, and re-coat the tripod’s exterior with sweet clay to a thickness of two *fen*. Suspend it in a furnace, ensuring the base is open for fire access. Add four *liang* of pure mercury and two *ge* of water to the golden tripod, then seal it with the lid.

Maintain gentle fire for seven days, ensuring five *liang* of glowing charcoal remains beneath the tripod at all times—neither increasing nor decreasing. Continuously replenish water in the tripod, always maintaining two *ge* without allowing it to dry. Attend carefully to the process, lest the moment be lost. After seven days, add another four *liang* of pure mercury, then nurture with gentle fire for another seven days as before. Once dry, tightly seal the opening and apply strong fire for one day. This will produce *ling sha* (red radiant cinnabar), yielding five *liang* of red cinnabar.

Then add five *liang* of pure mercury to the tripod, ensuring the vessel always contains eight *liang* of mercury—neither more nor less. Nurture with gentle fire for seven days, then dry it and seal tightly. Apply strong fire for one day to generate cinnabar. Once formed, collect the cinnabar. Add more pure mercury to the tripod and alternate gentle and strong fire to cultivate further cinnabar. When the cinnabar appears, gather it. From this single tripod, collect a total of thirty *liang* of cinnabar before ceasing, for the quantity is now sufficient.

After the gold has yielded its cinnabar, its essence is exhausted, leaving it brittle and dull, weighing only about four *liang*—its vital essence having interacted with the mercury to fully transform into *ling sha*. Thus, the texts speak of "true mercury," which is drawn from its original cinnabar form for use. If refining luminous cinnabar as the medicinal base, extract mercury from it and replenish accordingly. If using *bai ma ya sha* (white horse-tooth cinnabar) as the base, extract mercury from it in turn. If employing *zi ling sha* (purple radiant cinnabar), take mercury from it for the process. Mercury derived from riverbank cinnabar is of mixed type and will not harmonize in *qi*.

From one *jin* of luminous cinnabar, fourteen *liang* of mercury may be extracted, flowing bright and white—this is the finest grade, containing only two *liang* of *shi hei* (stone residue). From one *jin* of *bai ma ya sha*, twelve *liang* of mercury may be drawn, containing four *liang* of *shi hei*. From one *jin* of *zi ling sha*, ten *liang* of mercury may be obtained, with six *liang* of *shi hei*. From one *jin* of high-grade transparent cinnabar, only eight and a half *liang* of mercury may be extracted, containing seven and a half *liang* of *shi hei*. *Shi hei* refers to the hollow, blackened residue of fire-stone. After mercury is extracted, about one *liang* of *shi tai* (stone embryo) remains, a pale gray ash.

The method for extracting mercury from cinnabar was briefly outlined in the previous chapter on precious cinnabar but not exhaustively detailed, hence its reiteration here. The extraction of mercury from cinnabar is enumerated among the superior methods in the preceding chapter on the Golden Elixir. Once thirty *liang* of *ling sha* is collected in the golden tripod, the quantity is sufficient, and no further yin-nurturing is needed. Proceed as in the earlier section, employing the yin-yang fire cycle, with five days as one phase. On the first day, use the *kan* trigram (water) to steam for one day. For the next four days, use the *gao* trigram (yang fire) to refine. Begin the yang fire with nine *liang* of charcoal, increasing by two *liang* with each subsequent cycle. After five cycles, increase by three *liang* per cycle, yielding three *liang* of five-colored *jin hui shuang* (golden radiant frost). Collect the frost and mix it with the cinnabar in a mortar, adding half a *fen* of *Pu Prefecture* chalcanthite and one *fen* of sulfur, grinding thoroughly with bitter wine for half a day. Return the mixture to the tripod and refine using the *kan* and *gao* trigram fire cycles. After fourteen phases—seventy days in total—the frost and cinnabar will be fully refined by fire.

Once refined, the cinnabar will glow with golden radiance, its hue like pomegranate blossoms, luminous as the sun and moon. All poisonous dragons, serpents, evil spirits, and demons will cower at its sight, unable to raise their eyes. Can anything be more divine? This cinnabar is potent yet difficult to cast. To melt it, first prepare a clean vessel of purified earth, free from impurities. Mix salt flowers with the *ling sha* and grind for two thousand revolutions before melting. Upon melting, the golden liquid will congeal into a vibrant red, called *hong jin* (red gold). *Hong jin* is the blackness of yin’s essence, refined away to reveal the pure yang’s radiance—this is the true gold of yang’s spirit.

For ingestion, follow the earlier method: boil with *yu gan zi* (elm sweet fruit), raw licorice, and *zi shi ying* (purple fluorite), extracting the juice in a precious vessel for fourteen days. The fire cycle and medicinal quantities should adhere to the previous instructions. Once boiled, place it in a sealed tube, secure the opening, and bury it in a cold spring or underground for twenty days. Then retrieve it, mix with jujube pulp, and form into pills—360 pills per *liang*, each the size of a hemp seed. The *ling sha*’s body will gradually grow heavier.

Each morning, after purifying oneself and facing east, invoke the Three Pure Ones and the True Officials, then pay homage to the ancestral master before ingesting. After consuming this *ling sha* elixir, the heart and spirit will become luminous, perception will penetrate inner and outer realms, the body will emanate red light, and one will merge with the utmost truth.

**Sixth Reversion Elixir: Divine Cinnabar**
The scripture states: When subtlety reaches its peak, spirit communicates; when spirit communicates, it attains divinity; when divinity unites, the Dao is complete; when the Dao is complete, the mysterious and true descend, allowing ascent to the Jade Clarity and attainment of high immortality.

*Shen sha* (divine cinnabar) is the congealed essence of the Nine Spirits, the condensed breath of the Treasure Wind, the crystallized radiance of the Mysterious Flower—transformed into divine cinnabar, resplendent in dark and yellow hues, its brilliance dazzling. Thus it is named *shen sha*.

**Method for Refining Divine Cinnabar:**
Take nine *liang* of the red, radiant gold from the previous *ling sha* and cast it into a precious tripod, capable of holding five *ge*. Use three *liang* of the same gold for the lid. First, place one *liang* each of sulfur, luminous cinnabar, red salt, and *Bei Ting* cinnabar inside the tripod, grinding them with bitter wine into a paste. Coat the interior of the tripod and lid evenly, ensuring the medicine is fully applied.

Once dry, seal the lid and encase the vessel in yellow clay mud, applying a thickness of two *fen* as the standard. Follow the previous method, nurturing it with gentle fire for two seven-day periods. Then, apply fierce fire to heat it for seven days until it matches the color of the flame. Once cooled, remove the yellow mud and re-coat the exterior of the tripod with sweet clay mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Place the tripod in the furnace, add six *liang* of true mercury into the vessel, and pour in three *ge* of water, replenishing gradually to prevent dryness. Nurture with gentle fire for seven days, then add another three *liang* of mercury. Continue with gentle fire for three more days, then allow it to dry. Seal tightly and secure the closure. Apply fierce fire for two nights, and it will fully transform into divine cinnabar of radiant red light. Collect the cinnabar, then add eight *liang* of mercury, nurturing with gentle fire for seven days before applying fierce fire for two days to produce more cinnabar. Collect the cinnabar, add seven *liang* of mercury, nurture with gentle fire, then apply fierce fire to generate cinnabar. Once the cinnabar forms, collect it, add five *liang* of mercury, and alternate between gentle and fierce fire. Continue until cinnabar is produced. Collect it, then add three *liang* of mercury, following the previous method of alternating gentle and fierce fire. In total, you will have gathered two *jin* and thirty-two *liang* of divine cinnabar—this is sufficient.

Place the cinnabar into a mortar with four *liang* of sulfur and two *liang* of *Pu Zhou* chalcanthite, grinding them thoroughly for half a day. Then transfer the mixture into a precious gold tripod and refine it with *yang* fire. *Yang* fire refers to the pure fire of the *Li* trigram. Refine it for five days as one cycle. Begin with nine *liang* of charcoal; after each cycle, add two *liang* of charcoal. After each cycle, remove the cinnabar, grind it thoroughly in the mortar, then return it to the tripod for further refinement. After five cycles, add three *liang* of charcoal per cycle. When *jiang jin shuang* (crimson gold frost) emerges, its red brilliance will dazzle the eyes. Collect the frost, mix it with the cinnabar in the mortar, add one *fen* of *Pu Zhou* chalcanthite, and grind thoroughly with bitter wine for half a day. Then return it to the tripod, seal tightly, and refine with fire for twelve cycles over sixty days. The divine cinnabar will have completed its refinement, its color resplendent and radiant, its purple glow penetrating—indescribable in words. If you wish to cast it, follow the method described in the previous *ling sha* section. When combined with *ling hua* (spirit flower) and stirred, it will flow like precious liquid, congealing into red gold, its essence glowing like fire—hence it is called the "gold of exalted attainment."

The divine cinnabar elixir may now be consumed. Divide each *liang* into 360 pills, forming them with jujube pulp. The method of ingestion follows the previous section. After consuming this divine treasure of divine cinnabar, one will naturally become spiritually attuned, bones lightened, the body luminous, and step into the true realm, ascending as a supreme immortal.

**Seventh Return Elixir: Mysterious True Crimson Radiance Cinnabar**

The scripture states: When the divine treasure is ordained by fate, resonance occurs and the spirit dwells within. By returning to the true and accumulating essence, naturally *xuan shuang* (mysterious frost) and *jiang xue* (crimson snow) arise, surging and circulating. Through circulation, one eternally becomes a transcendent spirit-immortal.

This *xuan zhen jiang xia sha* (mysterious true crimson radiance cinnabar) is the cinnabar born from nurturing mercury with the red gold of divine cinnabar in a precious tripod. Its cinnabar shimmers with purple radiance and red splendor, its five hues dazzling—thus it is named the cinnabar of mysterious true crimson radiance.

**Method for Refining Treasure-Born Cinnabar:**
Take one *jin* of the precious gold from the previous divine cinnabar and cast it into a round tripod, capable of holding seven *ge*. Use five *liang* of the same gold for the lid. First, place four *liang* of sulfur, two *liang* of red salt, two *liang* of *Bei Ting* cinnabar, and one *liang* of *da peng* cinnabar inside the tripod, grinding them with bitter wine into a paste. Coat the interior of the tripod evenly, ensuring the medicine is fully applied.

Once dry, seal the lid and encase the vessel in yellow clay mud to a thickness of one *cun*. Follow the method in the divine cinnabar section, nurturing it with gentle fire for two seven-day periods, then heating it with white charcoal and fierce fire for seven days. Once cooled, remove the mud and re-coat the exterior of the tripod with sweet clay mud to a thickness of two and a half *fen*. Suspend the tripod in the furnace, add twelve *liang* of true mercury into the vessel, and pour in three *ge* of water, ensuring it does not dry out by replenishing gradually. Seal the lid. Nurture with gentle fire for seven days, keeping the top of the tripod comfortably warm to the touch. After seven days, allow it to dry. Seal the opening tightly, then gradually apply fierce fire for three days. Upon opening, the mercury will have fully transformed into *jiang xia* (crimson radiance) mysterious cinnabar. Do not collect the cinnabar yet; instead, add nine *liang* of mercury and follow the previous method of alternating gentle and fierce fire to transform it into cinnabar. When the time is complete, open it—all will have turned to cinnabar. Add another six *liang* of mercury, seal tightly, and apply alternating gentle and fierce fire until the time is fulfilled. Upon opening, it will again have transformed into cinnabar. Add five *liang* of mercury, nurture with gentle fire for seven days, then apply fierce fire for one day to produce the cinnabar. Its red and purple hues, five radiant colors, and misty glow will fill the tripod—thirty-two *liang* in total, precise to the last grain.

Collect the cinnabar and place it in a mortar with seven *liang* of sulfur, grinding it finely with a jade pestle for one day. Then return it to the precious gold tripod of divine cinnabar, seal the opening tightly, and refine it with red *yang* fire for seven days as one cycle. Open it, remove the cinnabar, mix it with one *ge* of bitter wine, and grind thoroughly before returning it to the tripod for further refinement. Each seven-day period constitutes one cycle. Begin with thirteen *liang* of charcoal; after each cycle, add one *liang* of charcoal. By the third cycle, add two *liang* of charcoal per cycle. One to two *liang* of five-colored, light, and fresh *jiang xia shuang* (crimson radiance frost) will fly onto the lid of the tripod, resembling wheat grains in succession—collect it.

Combine the cinnabar in a mortar with half a *liang* of Pu Prefecture chalcanthite and two *ge* of bitter wine, grinding thoroughly before returning it to the tripod for refinement. Each cycle requires inspection; add chalcanthite and bitter wine, grind again, then return it to the tripod for further refinement. After seven cycles—forty-nine days in total—the cinnabar will have fully submitted to the fire. Then apply *wu* fire for one day, using twenty *jin* of charcoal divided into four heaps to burn intensely. Allow it to cool for one day before opening the tripod to behold the darkly true crimson radiance cinnabar. Once the fire-submission is complete, its patterns and hues blaze resplendently, intermingling with radiant light that illuminates sun and moon—truly the most numinous of substances, the cinnabar elixir of ultimate *yang* and primal mystery.

To smelt this darkly true cinnabar, follow the previous method for divine cinnabar and numinous cinnabar. Use numinous blossoms to harmonize and guide, allowing the precious liquid to flow forth and congeal into a purple glow—this is called "crimson radiance purple gold." If taken as a medicinal elixir, mix it with jujube pulp and form into pills, dividing each *liang* into three hundred and sixty. Each morning at dawn, face east and consume one pill. After ingesting this purple radiance wondrous cinnabar elixir, one will suddenly feel the body lighten and ascend, riding a flying dragon to roam beyond the ten heavens and eight limits—how could this not be the height of carefree joy?

A single pill of this darkly true cinnabar elixir can transmute a *jin* of mercury, lead, tin, copper, or iron into purple-lustered yellow gold, its brilliance and luster beyond description. I, having established this divine teaching, received it from the Mysterious Lord, moved by the worthy and enlightened among the worldly, and thus composed it into seven chapters and two sections. This text originates from the *Great Cavern Treasure Scripture*, specifically the "Nine Grades of Hidden Writings on Refining the True Wondrous Methods" revealed by the Immortal Lords. The prohibitions on its transmission are severe; it must not be passed to the unworthy. How could it be shown to the stubborn, violent, perverse, or doubtful—those who are but walking corpses with defiled natures? Such exposure must be deeply avoided, lest the true wonders of the ancient immortals and sages be divulged.

Here ends the *Great Cavern Refining the True Wondrous Methods for Subduing Numinous Cinnabar*.
