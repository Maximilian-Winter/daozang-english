#### **Divine Elixir of Golden Essence of the Great One**
Take five taels of gold, hammer into thin sheets, plane and shred them, then place in an earthen crucible. First, use five taels of gold and six taels of mercury. Heat the gold sheets in fire until they match the fire’s color. Warm the mercury separately in an earthen crucible, then add the gold sheets to the mercury, where they will dissolve. Refin the golden mud, allowing a slight loss of mercury. Then grind thoroughly with a jade pestle until fine enough for medicinal use.

Pound thoroughly with a pestle for a day, blend with wine, and seal the upper and lower cauldrons to prevent gaps. Grind *duya* (sealing clay) until smooth for a secure seal.

**Alternative Method:** Take fine, firm yellow earth, dry in the sun, and pound.

**Another Method:** Use red halloysite, left-turning oyster shell, and finely processed salt for a very secure seal.

#### **Prohibitions for Subliming Elixirs**
Spring: Avoid *wuzǐ* and *jǐsì* days.
Summer: Avoid *dīngsì*, *wùshēn*, *jǐchǒu*, *wùchén*, and *jǐwèi* days.

Autumn: Avoid *wùxū*, *xīnhài*, *jǐhài*, and *gēngzǐ* days.
Winter: Avoid *wùyín*, *dīngwèi*, *gēngxū*, *jǐmǎo*, and *guǐyǒu* days.

**Auspicious Days for Igniting the Elixir Fire**
Fifth day of the fifth month, seventh day of the seventh month, ninth day of the ninth month, *jiǎshēn*, *yǐsì*, and *yǐmǎo*.
Alternatively, during the months governed by the sun, after the Beginning of Summer, select days of *jiǎzǐ* that align with the cyclical phases of *chéng*, *kāi*, *shōu*, *chú*, *píng*, or *dìng*—all are auspicious.
For igniting the fire, choose the hour of *wánggēng*; if unavailable, use the fifth watch. Avoid disturbances or startling movements.

**General Rule for Elixir Compounding**
No more than three persons may participate; exceeding this number disrupts harmony of intent.

**Zhaohun Elixir Method**
Also called *Fanhun Elixir*, *Gengsheng Elixir*, or *Guiming Elixir*.
- Cinnabar: five taels
- Realgar: five taels
- Orpiment: five taels
- Azurite: five taels
- Sulphur: five taels
- Arsenolite: five taels each (two entries)
- Mercury: three catties (alternatively, one catty)

Follow the method of the *Four Spirits Elixir*, subliming it five or six times until fully refined and suitable for ingestion.
Best taken in combination with the *Sulphur Nine*.

**Sulphur Elixir Method**
- Sulphur: two taels
- Cattail pollen: two taels
- Limonite: two taels
- Poria: two taels

Pound and sift the four ingredients, blend thoroughly, and form into pills the size of small beans. Take two pills to summon the hun-soul.
One pill may be combined with sulphur; taking two together cures all diseases with divine efficacy.
If excessive heat is a concern, omit the sulphur—this is also effective.
If mercury is unavailable, substitute with *shuǐyínshuāng* (mercury frost) in equal measure; this is excellent.
If mercury is too costly to procure, do not hesitate to use it abundantly.

**Wuji Elixir**
Also called *Jiangu Elixir*, *Wuwei Elixir*, or *Ningshen Elixir*.
- Gold tooth: one tael
- Calcite: two taels
- Stalactite: one tael
- Realgar: four taels
- Orpiment: four taels
- White quartz: one tael
- Mirabilite: two taels
- Purple quartz: one and a half taels
- Niter: one tael
- Maifan stone: one tael
- Sodium sulfate: two taels
- Oyster shell: two taels
- Stalactite (repeated): one tael

Sublime following the method of the *Four Spirits Elixir* for three days and nights. Grind finely and form into pills the size of sesame seeds. One pill cures all ailments.
The *Zhaohun Elixir*, when taken over time, prolongs life without taboo.

**Ziyou Elixir Method**
Also called *Buxu Elixir*, *Yaojing Elixir*, *Qingju Elixir*, *Daojing Elixir*, or *Lingxu Elixir*.
- Realgar: three taels
- Orpiment: three taels
- White quartz: three taels
- Purple quartz: three taels
- Stalactite: three taels
- Jade fragments: three taels
- Cinnabar: three taels

Sublime following the method of the *Jinying Elixir*—extremely efficacious.

**Gensue Elixir Method**
Also called *Shuiyinshuang Elixir*, *Liuzhu Baixue Elixir*, *Liuhgong Suhuang Elixir*, *Xuanzhu Jiangshuang Elixir*, *Taiyang Hongfen Elixir*, *Feihong Huayao Elixir*, *Zhaoxia Sancai Elixir*, *Xiyue Liuguang Elixir*, *Chenjin Liuhui Elixir*, or *Ningjie Jixue Elixir*.
- Tin: twelve taels
- *Hongshuang* (arsenic trioxide): one catty
- *Tesheng Yushi* (special arsenolite): one catty
- Red alum: one catty
- Sodium sulfate: five taels
- *Taiyin Xuanjing* (selenite): six taels
- Salt: one catty

Place the tin in a cauldron and heat with a fierce fire until it melts into liquid. Skim off the dross with an iron ladle, then heat another cauldron until slightly warm. Pour the tin liquid into it, stir evenly with the ladle, and immediately pour onto a cool surface. After a short while, it will congeal like white silver. Take the *fánshuāng* (alum frost), pound gently, and sift through a horsehair sieve. Similarly, pound and sift the sodium sulfate and *xuanjing* separately.
Mix the salt powder with mercury and tin, then pound and sift through a horsehair sieve. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.
Spread a layer of white salt about three *fen* thick at the bottom, press firmly, then add the mixed ingredients. Cover with sodium sulfate.
Apply a mild fire for four days and nights, using no more than one catty of charcoal. Ensure the upper lid remains as warm as a human body, gradually adding three to five stalks of fuel. After two more days, increase to a strong fire, keeping the upper cauldron too hot to touch without interruption.
Maintain the strong fire for seven days, then allow it to cool for one night before opening. If the fire’s intensity is well-regulated, the refined essence will ascend to the upper cauldron like frost or snow. Alternatively, it may form a coiled pattern on the upper cauldron, resembling exquisite frost or snow—radiant and dazzling, astonishing to behold. Even the most discerning scholars cannot help but marvel.
If the fire is uneven or the heat inconsistent, the essence will adhere to the upper cauldron, turning a dull black.
Once the refined essence is obtained, sublime it again with the following ingredients:
- Alum: three taels
- Sodium sulfate: three taels
- White salt: one catty
- *Xuanjing*: three taels

Pound and sift as before. First grind the *liuhgongshuāng* (flowing mercury frost), then blend with the other ingredients. Arrange and cover as previously described, subliming for the same duration as before. Repeat three to five times for optimal results.
If *taiyin xuanjing* is difficult to obtain, seek it near salt ponds in Hebei, where it floats on the water’s surface. The finest specimens resemble jade in texture and tortoiseshell in shape. Avoid the dark and heavy varieties; the yellow-white, translucent ones are superior.
When this elixir is combined with *hóngshuāng*, it naturally crumbles into powder. After subliming three to five times, grind it extremely fine, mix with jujube paste, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds. Begin with four or five pills per dose, increasing to six or seven. All diseases will be cured.

**Five-Flavor Elixir Method**
- Mercury frost: one catty
- Niter: five taels
- Calcite: five taels
- Gypsum: five taels
- Chalcanthite: five taels

Combine the ingredients listed above, sift together, and sublime directly without moistening with wine. Place in a crucible for three days and nights—this process is called "flying to summon the soul."

**Five Peaks Perfected One’s Minor Return Elixir Formula**
Also named *Golden Essence Elixir*, *Flying Void Elixir*, *Immortal Calyx Elixir*, or *World-Saving Elixir*.
- Cinnabar: ten taels
- Realgar: ten taels
- Azurite: ten taels
- Magnetite: ten taels
- Stalactite: ten taels
- Niter: ten taels
- Cinnabar sand: ten taels
- Jade essence: ten taels
- Limonite: ten taels
- White alum: ten taels
- Dark litharge: ten taels
- Calcite: ten taels
- Talc: ten taels
- Chalcanthite: ten taels

Enclose the ingredients in a tube made of fresh bitter bamboo, seal the ends with wax, press into place, and immerse in the *Flower Pool* for twenty days. Remove and dry in the shade for another twenty days. Grind and sift each ingredient separately, then blend with wine to form pills. Place in a jade crucible and refine following the method for *Purple Wandering Elixir*. Ensure no qi escapes, applying gentle and strong fire alternately for three days and nights. Open the crucible: the ingredients will have settled in distinct layers, ground to powder.

First add cinnabar, then jade essence, aligning top and bottom precisely. Seal tightly. Begin with horse-dung fire for three days and nights, then switch to charcoal fire for another three days and nights—gentle fire first, strong fire later. The elixir will fly into the upper crucible. Once formed, remove and grind in a mortar with a jade pestle until fine as powder. Mix with jujube paste (skin removed) to form pills the size of millet grains. Take three pills per dose, swallowed with wine or broth.

**Great One’s Minor Return Elixir Formula**
Also named *Great Essence Elixir*, *Dawn Radiance Elixir*, *Condensed Rosy Clouds Elixir*, or *Setting Glow Elixir*.
- Mercury: one catty
- Sulfur: five taels

Grind sulfur into powder and spread on thick white paper. Heat over charcoal fire until molten, then drip into water. Discard the paper. Repeat three times, then weigh out five taels. Take a new porcelain jar (under two *sheng* capacity, coated inside and out with oil), sift fine yellow earth, mix with lime, paper fiber, and water to form a paste, and apply a three-*fen* layer to the jar’s exterior. Dry in the sun. Prepare a new porcelain lid to match the jar (also oil-coated inside), and seal its exterior with the same paste to a thickness of three *fen*. Dry in the sun.

Prepare an iron stand to support the jar’s base. Construct a wind furnace, five *cun* taller than the jar, with five *cun* clearance on all sides. Build the furnace from bricks and clay, leaving four wind vents at the base. Once dry, use as follows: Place mercury in the jar and warm gently over low fire. In a separate pan, melt sulfur until liquid, then pour into the jar with mercury. Stir briefly; as it cools, the mercury will fragment like crushed tin, forming clumps.

Cover with the prepared lid, seal tightly with the same paste, and place the jar in the furnace. Apply gentle fire around the jar’s sides to dry the seal. Gradually increase heat. Begin with gentle fire, then switch to strong fire, until purple flames appear above the jar and a sound is heard. Keep the fire hollow at the center, adding charcoal gradually. Maintain this for one hundred nights, then slowly reduce the fire to cool. Open the jar: the elixir will adhere to the jar’s sides and lid, resembling pomegranate seeds in shape and purplish-black in color.

Grind in water, collect the finest particles—brighter and redder than cinnabar. Once refined, grind finely and mix with cooked glutinous rice to form pills the size of small coriander seeds. Take five pills daily, increasing to five hundred pills. All diseases will be cured.

An alternate method states: Begin firing at dawn, and by midday the elixir will be ready for consumption. Form into pills. Steam and dry sesame seeds, then take the pills with white wine or broth. Avoid blood broths, raw fish, excessive alcohol, and cold foods.

**Great Yang Sulfur Elixir Formula**
Also named *Great Yang Powder Elixir*.
- Sulfur: three catties

Grind and sublime in an elixir crucible, using two basins as upper and lower covers. Apply gentle fire for three days and nights; the sulfur will fly into the upper basin, resembling golden powder. Grind and form into pills for consumption.

**Eight-Stone Elixir Formula**
Also named *Radiant Sun Elixir*, *Pure Moon Elixir*, *Tribulation-Passing Elixir*, or *World-Saving Elixir*.
- Cinnabar
- Realgar
- Orpiment
- Azurite

Refine these four ingredients through three sublimations; they are then ready for consumption.

**Alternate Formula**
- Realgar
- Orpiment
- Sulfur
- Azurite
- Malachite
- Cinnabar
- Alum

Grind, sift, and refine as above.

**Another Formula**
- Cinnabar
- Realgar
- Orpiment
- Azurite: each four taels
- Limonite
- Magnetite
- Niter
- Alum: each one tael

**Yet Another Formula**
- White quartz
- Arsenolite

Follow the previous method.

**Dragon-Cinnabar Elixir Formula**

**Trailing Silk Elixir**
Also named *Mulberry Dew*, *Containing Light*, or *Spouting Radiance*.
- Cinnabar
- Realgar
- Orpiment
- Sulfur
- Azurite: each ten taels

Grind, sift, and finely pulverize. Place within a summoning vessel, and sublime for three days and nights. The elixir will entirely ascend into the upper basin, while the residue below crumbles like ash. If hardened into iron-like clumps, the elixir is fully sublimed. Grind and sift again, then sublime as before for another three days and nights until the refined essence ascends completely. Collect and blend with fine musk and white glutinous rice paste, forming pills the size of hemp seeds. Take one pill per dose, washed down with wine or broth.

**Eight-Spirit Elixir Formula**
Also named *Primal Essence*, *Sun-Shining*, *Flowing Rosy Clouds*, or *Divine Radiance*.
- Cinnabar
- Azurite
- Realgar
- Arsenolite
- Arsenic trioxide
- Magnetite
- Niter: each ten taels

Place each ingredient in separate silk bags and steep in three-year-old rice wine for two days and nights. Remove, dry in the shade, then grind and sift individually. Layer them sequentially into the basin, covering with niter. Seal with Six-One Mud, then apply gentle fire for three days and nights, followed by strong fire for another three days and nights. Cool for one night, then collect the sublimed elixir from the upper basin. Grind again and resublime five or six times until it turns snow-white, then it is ready for consumption.

**Supreme Realgar Elixir**
Also named *Crimson Flow*, *Plain Radiance*, *Vermilion Scenery*, *Double Light*, or *Intertwined Crimson-Purple Elixir*.
- Realgar: three catties

Contain in a bronze vessel and boil in wine for three days and nights until toxicity dissipates. Dry in the sun for nine days, then grind and sift. Moisten with wine, dry in the sun, and repeat seven times. Finally, sublime according to the *Summoning Soul Elixir* method for seven days and nights until it turns snow-white, then it may be consumed.

**Alternate Formula**
- Realgar: one catty

Grind and sift through fine silk gauze. Moisten with pure wine until damp, then dry in the sun. Repeat the moistening and drying over ten times. First, line the basin with white salt, pressing it firmly. Mix the realgar powder with white salt, place it over the salt bed, and cover with another layer of white salt. Seal the upper basin with Six-One Mud to prevent qi leakage. Apply gentle fire for one day and night until the mud dries. Gradually increase the fire, avoiding sudden intensity. After one full day and night, apply the strongest fire, ensuring the lower basin glows red-hot day and night without interruption. Maintain this fierce fire continuously for three days and nights, then cool for one day and night. Open the basin, collect the elixir, and grind finely. Sift the residue separately, then recombine with the refined elixir. Moisten with wine as before, repeat the process, and follow the same fire regimen. After two cycles, the elixir will be complete.

**Five-Numinous Elixir Formula**
Also named *Ascending Rosy Clouds*, *Soaring Sky*, *Numinous Transformation*, *Great One’s Summoning Soul*, or *Returning Rosy Clouds Elixir*.
- Mercuric chloride
- Realgar
- Sulfur
- Cinnabar
- Orpiment: each ten taels

Grind and sift, then moisten with wine and dry in the sun seven times. Place in the basin with white salt as a bedding. Layer the minerals, with mercuric chloride on top, then cover with a three-fen-thick layer of white salt. Sublime according to the *Summoning Soul Elixir* method for three days and nights. Form pills the size of hemp seeds; take one per dose to cure all illnesses.

**Alternate Formula**
- Mercuric chloride: three catties
- Realgar
- Sulfur
- Cinnabar: each two catties

Grind and sift the four ingredients together, moisten with wine until damp, and dry in the sun four or five times. For sublimation and fire duration, follow the previous method.

**Five-Stone Elixir Formula**
Also named *Five-Star Elixir*, *Five Essences*, *Five Forms*, *Five Emperors*, *Five Peaks*, *Five Numinous*, or *Eight Immortals Elixir*.

The Five-Stone Elixir was favored by Liu An, the King of Huainan, who was devoted to the Dao. Moved by his sincerity, the Eight Immortals descended to bestow this formula upon him. Liu An later gifted it to Zuo Hao, thus transmitting it to the world. This elixir captures the essence of five minerals, and those who consume it attain longevity, transcending the mortal realm to dwell among the immortals.

The five stones are the essences of the five celestial bodies:
- Cinnabar: the essence of the Great Yang (Mars).
- Magnetite: the essence of the Great Yin (Mercury).
- Azurite: the essence of the Lesser Yang (Jupiter).
- Realgar: the essence of the Central Earth (Saturn).
- Arsenolite: the essence of the Lesser Yin (Venus).

These five stellar essences bestow immortality upon the consumer.

**Alternate Formula**
- Azurite: the essence of the Eastern Blue Emperor, Wood, and Azure Dragon.
- Cinnabar: the essence of the Southern Red Emperor, Fire, and Vermilion Bird.
- White arsenolite: the essence of the Western White Emperor, Metal, and White Tiger.
- Magnetite: the essence of the Northern Black Emperor, Water, and Black Tortoise.
- Realgar: the essence of the Central Yellow Emperor, Earth, and Yellow Dragon.

These five ingredients are governed by the fiery spirits of the Five Emperors of the Supreme Subtlety. To compound this elixir, take ten taels of each, grind and sift into powder, then moisten with wine as in the *Eight-Spirit Elixir* method. Additionally, one must obtain the Five Emperor Spirit Talismans to place above the elixir during sublimation; without these talismans, the elixir cannot be completed. The talismans are recorded in separate esoteric transmissions, and also appear in the *Three Sections of Laozi’s Talismans*.

The five stones embody the generative qi of the five celestial bodies. Consuming their true essence and qi grants a lifespan equal to heaven and earth. This formula must not be lightly transmitted except to those of utmost sincerity and devotion to the Dao.

(Other minerals such as niter, amethyst, and stalactite are also mentioned.)

The substance is named *White Entering Stone*.

**Method for Constructing the Elixir Furnace**
Beneath the furnace, iron bars must be installed—twelve or thirteen in number, each one foot in length, four *fen* thick on all sides. Arrange them upon the furnace pit, spaced two *fen* apart. The bars should be suspended, leaving a two-*cun* gap above the ground. The central opening should be four and a half *cun* wide, with front and rear passages to facilitate airflow. When fire is kindled upon the bars, the wind and qi will fan it, ensuring optimal combustion. This method is essential.

**Method for Crafting the Medicine Cauldron**
The lower iron cauldron should hold one *dou*, with a diameter of nine *cun* and a depth of three *cun*. The base, where it resists the fire, should be eight *fen* thick, while the sides are three *fen* thick. The upper and lower circumferences should be uniform, with a flat base. The surrounding lip should be one and a half *cun* wide and three *fen* thick, also flat. On either side, handles three *cun* long should be affixed, positioned three and a half *cun* below the upper lip. The lid should be made of fired clay, with a diameter of nine *cun* and four *fen*, a depth of eight *cun*, and a thickness of three *fen*. The lid should be slightly rounded and flat.

This cauldron design is for the initial extraction of refined medicine, hence its larger size. After the refined medicine is obtained, a smaller cauldron should be used for further refinement. The smaller cauldron should have a mouth diameter of six *cun*, a depth of two and a half *cun*, with all other dimensions—thickness and shape—matching the larger cauldron. Its lid should have a diameter of six *cun* and two *fen*, a depth of six *cun*, and otherwise follow the same design as the larger lid.

*Record of the Stone Wall of the Great Clarity*, Scroll One—concluded.

Master Chuze’s Compilation of Eight Divine Elixirs

**Eight-Spirit Elixir Formula**
*Kongqing* (malachite) – half a *jin*
Magnetite, white quartz, and *poshao* (sodium sulfate) – each half a *jin*
Stalactite – five *liang*
Grind the above ingredients to a fine powder, sift, and blend with wine, following the method for the Four-Spirit Elixir. However, cover the other ingredients with *poshao*, differing from the Four-Spirit method, and sublimate seven times.

**Three-Agents Elixir Formula**
Mercury frost – one *jin*
Cinnabar – two *jin*
Realgar – one *jin*
Grind the three ingredients to a fine powder, sift, and blend with wine, covering the top with mercury frost. Additionally, sprinkle salt flowers over it. Otherwise, follow the Four-Spirit Elixir method, sublimating five times.

**Summoning-Soul Elixir Formula**
Also called Returning-Soul, Reviving, Returning-Life, or Preserving-Life.
Cinnabar, realgar, sulfur, and magnetite – each five *liang*
Mercury – one *jin*
Melt the sulfur into liquid, pour it into the mercury, and stir to form green sand. Combine with the other mineral ingredients, grind finely, sift, and blend with wine, following the Four-Spirit method. However, the number of sublimations exceeds that of the Four-Spirit Elixir.

**Flowing-Pearl Elixir**
Also called Red Radiance, Crimson Brilliance, Double Glow, Red Medicine, or Red Frost.
Realgar – one *jin*
Grind to a fine powder, sift, and blend with wine until slightly damp. Follow the Four-Spirit method, but mix with salt powder and layer it. Cover with additional salt, seal tightly, and apply gentle heat for a day and night, gradually increasing to strong fire for three days and nights. Cool, then sublimate three times.

**Alternative Formula**
Flying realgar and orpiment – each ten *liang*
Grind finely, blend with rice wine, and dry in the sun, following the Four-Spirit Elixir method.

**Alternative Formula**
Oven earth (*fulonggan*) and salt powder – twice the amount of realgar
Grind the two ingredients finely and mix with realgar. Arrange and seal as in the Four-Spirit Elixir method, but use a milder fire, with gentle heat prevailing over strong. Sublimate once every seven days.

**Method for Crafting Mercury Frost**
Mercury – one *jin*
Tin – two *jin*
*Poshao* – four *liang*
*Taiyin* dark essence – six *liang*
Calcined *huangfan* (yellow vitriol) – one *jin* (red vitriol may also be used)
First, place tin in a cauldron and melt over strong fire. Warm the mercury separately, then pour it into the tin and stir. Pour onto the ground, and it will soon solidify, white as silver.
Mix the tin with two *jin* of salt, grind to break it apart, and sift repeatedly through a horsehair sieve until fine. Combine with the dark essence and vitriol powders, arranging as in the Four-Spirit method. Cover the top with *poshao* powder and apply gentle heat for seven days and nights, with strong fire used sparingly. The frost will form like hibiscus blossoms on top, most pleasing to the eye. Collect the frost and grind it further.
Vitriol – five *liang*
*Poshao* – five *liang*
Dark essence – five *liang*
Grind the above separately, arrange as before, and sublimate several times for best results.

**Method for Crafting Cinnabar Frost**
Cinnabar – two *jin* (first grind to a fine powder and sift seven times through fine silk)
Red vitriol – one and a half *liang*
Yellow vitriol – one *liang*
Grind all to a fine powder, blend with wine, and dry in the sun seven times. Line the bottom and sides of the cauldron with salt and ash paste. Fill the cauldron with salt, adjusting the amount based on the medicine. Shape the salt into a bowl form, place the medicine inside, and press firmly with a copper spoon. Cover with a layer of salt, then a layer of oven earth, then another layer of salt. Top with *poshao*, pressing flat with the spoon. Sprinkle with rice wine, then place the upper cauldron and seal tightly.
First, seal the upper cauldron with hemp-fiber paste, sweeping and reinforcing the seams to a thickness of three *fen*, ensuring it is extremely secure. Apply gentle heat for four days and nights, then strong fire for two days, and intense fire for one day. Cool, moisten the sealed areas with water, then open and use.

**Method for Crafting Gold and Silver Powders**
Gold and silver – each two *liang*
*Hutonglü* – two *liang* (ground to powder)
Beat the gold and silver into thin sheets, then boil in lard in a cauldron for fifteen cycles. Wash with soapberry to remove all lard, then grind the sheets in a porcelain basin until fine. Mix with salt and grind for seven days.
Strain through triple-layered raw silk to remove water and collect the silver powder. Refine in a sleeve-sand crucible over low heat, avoiding strong fire. Remove, grind further, then combine the powder with *hutonglü*. Refine with water, strain through triple-layered raw silk, and dry the powder. Grind until extremely fine before use.

**Genxiao Elixir**
Also called Flowing-Pearl White Snow, Flowing Pure Snow, or Dark-Pearl Crimson Snow.
Mercury – one *jin*
Tin – twelve *liang*
Warm the mercury in a cauldron over fire. Melt the tin in a separate cauldron, pour it into the mercury, and transfer to a clean surface, where it will form a silver cake. Grind the cake to powder and sift.
Red vitriol, white vitriol, and *Taiyin* dark essence – each four *liang*
Grind and mix with the silver powder. Combine with oven earth and salt powder, arranging as in the Four-Spirit method. Cover the top with one *jin* of *poshao*, then sprinkle with fine white salt flowers and seal tightly.
Apply gentle heat for four days, gradually increasing the fire, but keep it mild, avoiding the strong fire used in the Four-Spirit method. After seven days, apply intense fire for the duration of one meal. Cool, then open to collect the elixir frost. Some may not rise but will instead form hibiscus-like clusters within the salt flowers. Refine the frost following the Four-Spirit method.

**Method for Crafting Internal Elixir**
Take the previously sublimated elixir, having undergone three sublimations, and remove it. No need to detoxify—simply grind finely and form into pills. For internal use, take five pills wrapped in thin silk. The raw elixir treats scabies, ringworm, clove sores, internal abscesses, chronic hemorrhoids, snakebites, and toothache. It is universally applicable.

**Method for Refining Sulfur with Vinegar Water**
Take one *jin* of pure, bright sulfur. Grind it finely. Place a clean tile slanted—one end high, one end low—lay a sheet of paper upon it, and spread the sulfur in the center. Apply fire beneath; position a small basin at the lower end of the tile to collect rice vinegar. The sulfur will melt and form into small beads. Transfer these beads into the vinegar, then return them to the tile to melt again. Repeat this process seven times.

Next, place the sulfur in a thick silk bag, tie it to a horizontal rod, and suspend it in a pot filled with rice vinegar. Ensure the bag does not touch the bottom. Boil for three days and nights, replenishing the vinegar as it evaporates. Then boil in vinegar-water for another three days and nights, followed by one day and night in clear water. Remove and dry in the sun. Set upon a stand and grind finely. Mix with five *sheng* of cow’s milk, then dry in the sun. Once dry, mix again with milk and bake until fully desiccated. Form into pills or powders for consumption.

**Method for Ingesting Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of refined cinnabar. Boil it in rice vinegar for three days and nights, then grind finely. Mix with vinegar, dry in the sun, and grind ten or more times. Place in a bamboo tube and steam within a steamer for ten cycles. Consume as desired.

**Method for Crafting Iron-Liquid Elixir**
Take one hundred *jin* of hardened iron. Forge it into a mirror, with a central hole large enough to admit a finger, five *cun* in diameter and three *fen* thick. Scrape both sides smooth and level. Forge a square ingot, seven *cun* long, four *cun* wide, and three *fen* thick, with a hole on top.

Prepare three *sheng* of wine, ground pepper, *huajiao*, long pepper, and dried ginger—each sifted. Add one *sheng* of salt, fourteen *liang* of magnetite, and one *sheng* of vinegar. Mix with vinegar, then coat the mirror and ingot. Pierce the mirror with the long iron rod, shaving off three *fen* from each piece.

Bury a ceramic jar in the ground, place a wooden stand inside, and arrange the mirrors and ingots in layers upon it. Cover with a ceramic basin, seal the jar’s mouth, and heap soil one *chi* thick over it. Sprinkle with saltwater daily to keep it moist. After one hundred fifty days, open it: the mirrors will have sublimated into elixir. Scrape with a knife, grind in wine, and collect in a vessel. Grind thoroughly, then decant for use.

**Morning Radiance Elixir Formula**
Realgar, orpiment—refine with water, collect the floating particles, transfer to a vessel, and grind to completion. Stalactite, white quartz, magnetite, *shifei*, mica. Sift and process following the Four-Spirit method, but increase the quantity. Mix with vinegar and dry in the sun.

**Sunlight Brilliance Elixir Formula**
Realgar, orpiment, white quartz, mica, *konggongnie*, *yushi*. Sift and process following the Four-Spirit method, but increase the number of cycles.

**Soaring Cloud Elixir Formula**
Realgar, orpiment, malachite, cinnabar, stalactite, *yushi*, gypsum, limonite, *taiyin xuanjing*, alum. Sift and process following the Four-Spirit method.

**Method for Ingesting Elixirs**

For all ailments such as chronic stiffness and pain, take jujube pulp and fermented black soybeans at dawn each day, along with two elixir pills, and swallow with warm wine.

**Prohibitions When Ingesting Elixirs**
While taking elixirs, avoid consuming sheep’s blood, carp, and foul or putrid substances.

**Reactions to Elixir Ingestion**
After taking the elixir, if you feel itching across the face and body as though insects are crawling, or experience swelling in the hands and feet, aversion to food odors, nausea when eating, mild weakness in the limbs, diarrhea or vomiting, headaches or abdominal pain—do not be alarmed. These are signs of the elixir’s efficacy in expelling illness.

**Elixir for Treating Malaria**
On the day of an attack, take three elixir pills with wine at dawn to induce vomiting. If vomiting does not occur by mid-morning, drink half a cup of wine to ensure it. For further attacks, take five pills on an empty stomach for a cure.

**Treatment for Sores and Ringworm**
For dry or moist ringworm, pierce the affected area, then apply moxibustion, wash with cloth, and mix the elixir with ghee to apply three to five times for healing.
For snakebites, mix the elixir with vinegar and apply.
For nail-like sores, pierce the lesion and insert the elixir three to five times until the necrotic flesh is consumed and healing occurs.

**Method for Internal Elixir Use**
Wrap raw elixir in thin silk and refrain from eating all day. At bedtime, use the middle finger to insert the elixir as deeply as possible. Shortly after, rumbling may be felt below the navel—endure it. By the third watch, if unbearable, expel the pus onto clean ground. Repeat for three to five measures over three nights, then take matured elixir to restore balance.

**Remedy for Elixir Reactions**
If the elixir’s effects manifest, bathe in hot and cold water, then drink a cup of scallion and fermented soybean wine prepared with the *xunhuang* method. If symptoms persist, decoct equal parts hornet’s nest, kansui, *weiluo*, and ephedra, and drink the infusion for immediate relief.

**On the *Xunhuang* Method**
*Xunhuang* is acrid, neutral, and strongly warming, with toxicity. It governs scabies and ringworm, kills parasites and snake venom, and repels malevolent spirits. Its ingestion differs little from realgar. To transmute copper and iron into gold and silver, only Wu-du *xunhuang* suffices. For common medicinal elixirs, Wu-du *xunhuang* is interchangeable with realgar—simply process it by grinding, sun-drying, and refining as previously described. This substance has been kept secret from ancient times to the present, rarely appearing in formulas, for it is often unsuitable for indiscriminate use, lest it be undervalued. I now disclose this to trusted confidants for transmission; do not share it with the unworthy.

This *Dan Jing* scroll must be passed down to one person every hundred years. Guard against reckless disclosure, lest misfortune befall both parties.

**Cinnabar-Refined Sulfur Elixir**
Refined sulfur: one piece
Cassia blossoms: two *jin*
Use a thick cast-iron pot for refinement. Line the pot with salt on all sides, three *cun* thick, forming a nest in the center. Place the sulfur inside, then cover with another three-*cun* layer of salt. Grind all into powder, seal the base tightly, and apply gentle heat as for cooking rice, changing the salt three times daily. Once complete, rinse with water and dry in the sun. Then coat with a thick layer of sweet clay, allow to dry, and heat gradually without interruption until slightly reddened. Stop, rinse, and dry again. Grind into powder, mix with white millet porridge, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take twenty pills daily.

**Method for Subduing Fire**
Use mercury in any quantity, placed in a white porcelain vessel. Mix ox dung with ash to form a thick base, then cover the mercury with ash. Seal tightly and dry in the shade.

Coat the bottle’s mouth to a depth of one *cun* with a mixture of ash and fine fur. Once this mud dries, the vessel’s opening is prepared. First, use mulberry ash to form a firm mud, and plug the opening with silk floss. Then apply the wrapping method: simply use salt-ash mud to seal the mouth, which also suffices. If rapid drying is desired, employ gentle fire and mix with hard ash to nurture it. For nurturing, use ox dung as a *nang*; for burning, encase it in charcoal. Layer these in sequence until the exterior is complete. When cool, retrieve it—the mercury will have congealed into a frost-like substance, yielding both softness and hardness in due measure.

**Four Spirits Elixir Formula**
Cinnabar
Realgar
Azurite
Orpiment
Grind the four ingredients separately into fine powder and sift. Use white salt as a base. Layer in sequence: first azurite, then orpiment, then cinnabar, then realgar. Cover again with white salt, aligning top and bottom. Seal firmly with Six-One Mud. Refine with civil and martial fire according to standard method, continuing for seven days and nights. The fire regimen remains thus.

**Alternative Formula**
Grind and sift the four ingredients directly, then mix thoroughly with strong vinegar until damp. Dry in the sun ten times, then place in the vessel and proceed as before. Following this method yields twice the elixir, with even finer color.

**Formula for Treating Oral Bleeding from Heatstroke**
Take four *fen* of cattail pollen and sift. Take half a slice of processed aconite, roasted. Grind the two ingredients separately. Mix with the blood of a white cock’s comb and form into mud. Apply immediately to stop the bleeding. Wash promptly afterward, lest the blood flow to one side.

*Taiqing Shibi Ji*, Scroll Middle, concludes.
*Taiqing Shibi Ji*, Scroll Lower.

**Method for Refining Stalactite**
The *Taiqing Jing* states: Take fine stalactite powder and place it in a gold or silver vessel. Insert a piece of tile inside, add one *fen* of nitre, and seal the vessel tightly to prevent qi from escaping. Steam it. When used, it naturally turns to liquid, called "refined stalactite," which is most excellent for consumption.

**Method for Making Iron Powder**
Take high-quality refined iron as the best option, file it finely into powder, and wash away the earthen qi. Mix thoroughly with three-year-old strong vinegar in a small clay basin until damp. Heat the basin’s base over a chaff fire until dry, then place in an iron mortar and pound. Sift through silk. Repeat the process with the remaining residue until fully exhausted.

Prepare twenty clay crucibles, slightly shaped like Buddhist censers with an opening. Mix the iron powder with vinegar until damp, place it in the crucibles, and seal tightly to prevent qi from leaking. Position the crucibles on a platform over a clay crucible, and heat with cow dung fire for nine days and nights until the clay crucible turns purple. Then perform water levigation. If residue remains, repeat the levigation until the powder is fine. Grind it finely in a porcelain basin and incorporate it into medicinal formulas. Its effects are comparable to the five metals.

**Avoid:** black nightshade, water buffalo meat, carp, garlic, and the like.

**Alternative Method for Making Iron Powder**
Take one *jin* of white iron—mirror fragments are best, though high-quality refined iron will suffice. File it finely, ensuring no earth or stone is mixed in. Weigh one *jin*, wash, and dry twenty times.

Take three large *liang* of high-quality white borax, one *sheng* of water, and mix with the iron filings. Stir until the borax fully dissolves the iron, then place in a cauldron and heat until the water evaporates. Add one *liang* of nitre and one *sheng* of water, soak for seven days, then return to the cauldron. Heat until the water evaporates, then sun-dry for two days. Place in a crucible, seal tightly, and heat gradually from low to high fire for one full day and night. Remove when cool, ensuring no ash or dust enters. Grind finely in a porcelain basin with a stone pestle, perform water levigation three times, and dry after removing the water. The resulting powder is ready. Mix with honey to form pills the size of small beans.

Take one pill daily after meals, increasing to two if no discomfort is felt. Each dose consists of one hundred pills. Most suitable for those aged twenty to eighty. Children with long-standing illnesses under three years old should not take it due to weak constitution; others may consume it. It does not treat jaundice but cures all other ailments. Adjust dosage according to the severity of the illness. This formula is highly effective both internally and externally.

If vomiting or diarrhea occurs, do not fear—abdominal pain or qi discomfort are signs of the elixir’s efficacy. Avoid: beef, clear wine, hemp seeds, blood broth, raw vegetables, radishes, mustard seeds, coriander, rape, garlic, and *qiaogai*. No other restrictions apply. After seven days of taking the elixir, eat freely as desired.

**Method for Taking the Eight Minerals Elixir**
Take while hungry at dawn on an empty stomach, one grain the size of a millet seed, sending the elixir down with fermented water. If forming pills, make them the size of small beans, taking two pills per dose until mild vomiting or diarrhea occurs. On the first day of taking the elixir, do not eat to satiety, as it will harm the person; one must always moderate intake until the ailment is cured. Within a hundred days of taking the elixir, if the four limbs feel drowsy and one desires sleep, with blisters appearing, this is the qi of the medicine stagnating—do not be alarmed.

**Method for Refining the Eight Minerals Elixir with Gold and Silver Powder**
Regardless of hunger or satiety, whenever one wishes to go out, take a portion the size of a sesame seed with a silver spoon, place it on the tongue, and let it dissolve naturally. After one dose, this may continue for a lifetime. Upon rising in the morning, rinse the mouth with water, and after eating, rinse the mouth again—swallow this water and do not discard it. After a hundred days, the four limbs may feel hot, swollen, and flushed, with white sores appearing all over the body—this is excellent, do not be alarmed. Eat five taels of cooked fatty pork from the ribs, with warm rice and a pinch of salt, and it will resolve. If it does not cease, take a portion of gold the size of two large soybeans, and it will immediately heal.

**Precautions for Taking the Eight Minerals Elixir**
Avoid *Acanthopanax* bark, sweet wormwood, iron-infused water, all blood-based broths, white wine, aged rice yeast, foul odors, drunkenness, slippery and hot foods, the five pungent vegetables, raw vegetables, anger, fear, anxiety, sexual intercourse, and women—these are strictly forbidden. This medicine is extremely stable and causes no disturbances.

According to the *Immortals’ Canon*: Three taels make one dose. Taking two or three taels will prevent all malevolent ghosts and spirits from approaching. Five taels will transform the five viscera and six bowels into golden blossoms, named the Jade Treasury, granting eternal life without death. The root of all illnesses is treated according to the following preparation. If one wishes to prolong life, enhance longevity, and supplement deficiencies, it may be taken long-term. Refine the elixir with two or three taels of gold leaf, flying it with gold, grinding and refining it thoroughly. When properly prepared in large or small quantities, it will neither induce vomiting nor diarrhea, ensuring great stability.

If staying alone in a secluded mountain area at night, burn a portion of the elixir the size of a large soybean—all malevolent ghosts and fierce beasts will naturally flee. If traveling through miasmic epidemics or seasonal pestilences, wrap the elixir in silk, wearing it in any quantity—men on the left, women on the right—to ward off ghostly ailments without fear.

**Method for Treating Leprosy with the Eight Minerals Elixir**
For falling eyebrows and hair, swollen and festering limbs, leprous sores, malevolent wind, raving speech, frenzied running, hard concretions like stone, the nine types of conglomeration heart pain, seasonal epidemics, abdominal distension and fullness, the eight winds, the twelve cold impediments, generalized numbness, malignant sores on the limbs: within a hundred days of taking the elixir, do not eat to satiety or consume various meats and blood—observe these precautions for a hundred days.

There are five types of leprosy: green wind generates green worms, yellow wind generates yellow worms, white wind generates white worms, red wind generates red worms, and black wind generates black worms. To determine whether the illness is curable, take the elixir—if worms are expelled, it will be known. Only black wind generating black worms the size of a fist is called the "direct retribution" and is incurable; all others can be cured.

**Method for Water-Refining Mica**
Select mica that, when held to the light, displays five brilliant, flawless colors. Then, finely split the mica, place it in a cloth bag, and wash it in a cauldron. Inside the cauldron, place a wooden rod across the mouth, suspend the bag so it does not touch the bottom. Add one or two sheng of refined white salt to the cauldron’s water and boil it, keeping it continuously simmering—if the water reduces, add more. Every three days, replace the old water with fresh water and salt. Continue this for seven days and seven nights. Then, rinse the mica in water, strain out the water, and let the moisture evaporate.

For five sheng of mica, add two sheng of white salt powder, place it in a wooden mortar, and pound it with a wooden pestle until refined. Then, place the refined mica in a large basin, stir it with water until dispersed. After a while, pour it out. Collect the finer particles in a separate basin, add water, stir briefly, and pour out again to collect the finer portion. After one or two repetitions, the finest particles will be exhausted, while the coarser ones remain. Strain the coarser portion, let the moisture evaporate, and again pound it with white salt until refined. Then, fly the particles to collect the finest, dry them in the sun, and call it "water-refined mica powder."

If no wooden mortar is available, grind it with a stone pestle—though this is not as effective as using a wooden pestle and mortar.

**Method for Taking the Elixir**
When taking the elixir, do so at dawn on an empty stomach after cleansing the mouth and washing the hands. Face east and swallow one pill. Follow this each morning without increasing the dose. Always wrap the pill in a jujube or swallow it with honey, and take it with clear water, wine, or plain broth—all are suitable.

While taking the elixir, avoid millet, beef, mutton, blood broth, white wine, boiled dairy, carp, and stews—none may be consumed.

Within fifteen days of taking the elixir, one may experience unusual sensations. Some may feel slight swelling over the body, numbness or discomfort in the limbs, or an inability to move freely, with sores beneath the flesh causing pain like crawling insects—this indicates residual wind-cold. Others may experience retching, vomiting, or excessive saliva—this indicates lingering spleen or lung ailments. Some may suffer headaches, dizziness, dry lips, flushed face, tearing eyes, or a runny nose—this indicates residual heat-wind. Others may feel restless hands and feet or pain in the chest and back—this stems from the five taxations and seven injuries. Some may experience mild diarrhea with pus and blood or the expulsion of various worms—this indicates disorders of the triple burner. Even if no unusual sensations arise, do not be alarmed by any of the above reactions. These are signs that the medicine’s qi is circulating, its divine power taking effect, and the movement of illness.

If the discomfort becomes unbearable, pause for three to five days to rest. Bathing in warm or cool water is beneficial, as is eating cold fermented soybeans, cold congee, or cold wheat porridge for one or two meals. Once strength is restored, resume taking the elixir as before. Do not discontinue at the first sign of distress. For without the medicine’s stirring, the illness will not be cured. Initial discomfort precedes great efficacy.

If vomiting or diarrhea persists after taking eight pills, eat cold mallow congee, cold fermented soybean porridge, or cold wheat porridge—all are beneficial. Alternatively, take five raw egg whites, beaten and consumed over three mornings. Or mix one *ge* of white milk with one or two *liang* of cold water and drink. Another method: pour three *sheng* of cold water in a fine stream—relief follows momentarily. If unresolved, pour six or seven *sheng* more in the same manner. Another remedy: refine one *liang* of *poxiao* (crude mirabilite) and take it all at once with cold water. Or grind one *liang* of *xiaoshi* (saltpeter) and take with water. Another option: grind one *liang* each of *shuiyin shuang* (calomel), *hanshuishi* (gypsum), and *shigao* (gypsum), mix with cold water, and take one *liang* at once. Or decoct licorice and mung beans, then take the cold liquid for immediate relief. Another method: drink three to five mouthfuls of cold water, or take one *sheng* of raw celery juice. Or decoct one *liang* each of ginseng and roasted licorice in one *sheng* of water until reduced to one *ge*, then take cold.

For unceasing pain from elixir-treated sores: gather yellow wormwood, pound to extract the juice, and wash the area—pain ceases. Another remedy: wash with a decoction of dried jujubes.

**Alchemical Ingredients and Their Qualities**
The forms and qualities of immortal-refined minerals vary in excellence.

For cinnabar: that which is radiant and translucent, resembling pomegranate seeds, is superior.

For realgar: that which is warm, moist, and red as a rooster’s comb is superior.

For jade: though many varieties exist, the finest is white, lustrous, and warm to the touch, free of blemishes, and emits a clear sound when struck.

For white quartz: regardless of size, that which is smooth, lustrous, and free of impurities, appearing the same color as water when submerged, is superior.

For purple quartz: that which resembles *lingjing* seeds, radiant and translucent, light and lovely beyond compare, is superior.

For magnetite: that which attracts five or six needles in a chain is superior, with greater attraction being best.

For mica: that which, when thinly split and held to the light, shimmers with five colors and dazzles the eyes is superior.

For stalactite: even in sublimation and refinement, only the finest should be used—select that which is lustrous, robust, and thick.

For alum: five varieties exist—yellow, white, blue, black, and red—but only yellow and white alum are commonly used. The rest are unsuitable. Yellow alum that is pure and bright is good. White alum from Wu is superior; the rest are unknown.

For saltpeter: since ancient times, it has been said that saltpeter can transmute all metals and stones into water, and that those who consume it may attain immortality. Yet this wondrous medicine’s origins remain unspoken, and its name alone persists, no different from absence. In recent times, Master Zhenbai (Tao Hongjing) compiled the *Herbal Prescriptions*, stating that *poxiao* (crude mirabilite) is the unrefined form of saltpeter, also called *mangxiao* (mirabilite).

Seeking the origins of these matters reveals only strange and aberrant accounts. Furthermore, according to the *Qipo Lun*: "Saltpeter originally comes from the land of Wuchang. Its qi is foul, and flying birds, upon smelling its qi, dare not fly over it. Consuming it directly can cause all the worms within the human body to dissolve into water upon entering the mouth. Refining and ingesting it with all metals and stones can confer longevity. For crude mirabilite (*poxiao*), select that which is free from wind damage, with a moist and supple form and a bluish-lustrous hue—this is superior. For mirabilite (*mangxiao*), that which resembles snow accumulated in a shady place, warm and moist, is superior. Though gold and silver are prized by people, they are not universally discarded, so I shall not elaborate further."

Yu yuliang (limonite) is found in the mountains of Zezhou. It appears in five colors—white, red, yellow, purple, and black—but only the yellow variety is used. That which is freshly harvested and resembles cattail pollen is superior; the rest are unsuitable.

Shizhong huangzi (yellow essence within stone) is found at the source of the Qin River. It resembles the shape of a parrot’s egg; when broken open, it yields a yellow liquid like an egg yolk. Obtaining three to five *sheng* and consuming it confers immortality.

**Purple Snow Formula**
A most excellent remedy for treating leg qi with toxic congestion, internal and external heat vexation, mouth sores, manic agitation, delirious running, and the resolution of heat from various herbal and mineral medicines, as well as sudden heat from toxin outbreaks, post-jaundice toxins, and the like.

Ingredients:
- Gold: 100 taels
- Silver: 200 taels
- Left-side han shui shi (calcium sulfate): 48 taels
- Gypsum: 48 taels
- Magnetite: 48 taels

Boil the above with one *dan* of clear water, reducing to four *dou*. Remove the gold, silver, and stones, then add to the decoction:
- Shengma (black cohosh): 16 taels
- Xuanshen (figwort root): 16 taels
- Antelope horn: 5 taels
- Rhinoceros horn: 5 taels
- Chenxiang (aloeswood): 5 taels
- Dingxiang (clove): 4 taels
- Qingmuxiang (costus root): 5 taels
- Prepared licorice: 8 taels

Finely chop all the above and boil together to extract one *dou* and five *sheng* of liquid. Strain, then add:
- Saltpeter powder: 4 taels
- Refined mirabilite powder: 4 taels

Simmer the mixture over a low flame until reduced to seven *sheng*, then transfer to a wooden basin. Add:
- Finely ground cinnabar: 3 taels
- Musk: 2 *fen*

Stir well until evenly mixed. After two days, it will form a purple snow-like frost.

For robust patients: take two to three *fen* with wine and mercury to treat consumptive dysentery, heat toxins, and wind. For the weak, elderly, or those with heat toxins, increase the dosage as needed. One preparation may be used for ten years—its divine efficacy is unparalleled. For those suffering from leg qi who develop heat toxins after consuming mineral medicines, taking this as a divine water (mixed with four *fen* per dose) is superior to ten doses of Sanhuang Tang.

**Golden Radiance Elixir Formula**
- Realgar
- Malachite
- Sulfur
- Taiyin xuanjing (selenite)
- Stalactite
- White quartz
- Mica
- Purple fluorite
- Wu white alum
- Saltpeter
- Gypsum
- Yu yuliang (limonite)
- Han shui shi (calcium sulfate)
- Red alum

Each of the above: two *jin*
- Crude mirabilite (*poxiao*)
- Mirabilite (*mangxiao*)

Take two *jin* each of Wu salt and the above ingredients, ten *liang* of gold, and four *jin* of mercury. First, hammer the gold into thin sheets, then combine with four *jin* of mercury to form an amalgam. Grind until extremely fine, then use cloth to press out two *jin* of mercury. Add one *jin* of Wu salt and grind together with the amalgam.

Next, take the aforementioned seventeen ingredients, pulverize, and sift them following the method for Nine-Cauldrons Elixir. Arrange and refine them. Once half the ingredients are processed, add the gold amalgam atop the other medicines. Then take the remaining medicinal powder and refine them together for one hundred days. Divide into five portions, and likewise divide the gold amalgam into five parts. Refine each portion according to the prescribed method, using gentle fire to sublimate and collect the elixir essence.

Next, place heavy salt in a decoction until the salt melts, at which point the gold will take on a copper-like hue. Then add three *liang* of salt. If intending to use the elixir, reheat it with salt for half a day until it turns red again. Repeat the process for a total of seven cycles, then use while hot.

**Method for Refining Arsenic Elixir**
Take one *jin* of high-quality arsenic, grind, and sift into a fine powder. Sift through silk until no residue remains. Take three *sheng* of first-press wine and three *liang* of white alum, pulverize, and sift into a powder. Add to the wine and dissolve. Mix with the arsenic until evenly moistened, then heat over a fire. Stir continuously in the crucible until the mixture dries. Remove, strain, and dry in the sun. Repeat this process twenty times until fully dry.

Take five *liang* of the mixture, grind, and sift into a fine powder like flour. Place in a crucible with three *liang* of saltpeter. Mix thoroughly, then grind and sift again into a powder. Spread evenly in the crucible, then add the arsenic mixture and level it with a feather. Cover with a basin that fits snugly over the crucible. Take water-floated charcoal ash, sift for the finest particles, and strain until dry. Mix with wine, grind, and add two *liang* of salt. Blend with the ash until the consistency is suitable for sealing. Apply to the rim of the basin to seal it completely, ensuring no drafts, with a thickness of about one *cun*. Place charcoal beneath the crucible. The charcoal should be five *cun* in length; initially, arrange three pieces horizontally at the bottom of the crucible. Sublimate for three days, then add one more piece of charcoal at noon, and another at early night. On the fourth day at dawn, let the furnace cool for one day and night. Once the furnace is cold, open it. Moisten the sealed areas with a damp cloth, remove the seal, and collect the frost-like sublimate from the basin’s base.

Place the sublimate in a basin, mix with wine, and repeat the previous method. Perform this process three times in total. Then place the sublimate in an iron pan and decoct with wine for one day and night. Remove, grind, and pulverize. Take three *liang* of licorice, crush, and decoct in two *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng*. Add the decoction to the pan with the sublimate and simmer until dry. Mix with cooked non-glutinous rice, form into pills the size of sesame seeds, and dry in the sun. These pills treat malaria, heart pain, and toothache. For the first dose, take three pills ground with wine. For self-administration, sublimate seven times.

**Specifications for Crucibles and Cauldrons**
The mouth should be six *cun* wide, five *cun* deep, with a base four *cun* wide.
