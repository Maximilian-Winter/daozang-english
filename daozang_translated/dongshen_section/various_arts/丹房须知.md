**Essentials for the Alchemical Chamber**
Recorded by Wu Hou, the Recluse of Gaogai Mountain (Ziranzi)

I have long encountered the Dao of immortals, and though daily cultivation and accumulated merit are essential, none surpass the reliance on the Great Elixir. From ancient times to the present, those who attained the Dao number no fewer than ten thousand. Some, through merit and conduct in this life, encountered perfected beings and received the divine elixir directly. Others, by virtuous causes from past lives, met true instructions, personally cultivated and refined them, and left behind texts to enlighten later generations. These teachings are not bound by mere words but reside in principle, expounded repeatedly and exhaustively. Those who encounter them do so not by chance.

When one meets a perfected being, the transmission cannot be withheld. Yet if the recipient is unworthy, the transmission must not be recklessly given. Once the scriptures and instructions exist, all may potentially attain them, regardless of wisdom or folly. Only the perfected—whose conduct aligns with the immortals—upon seeing sacred texts, naturally grasp their principles, like Pao Ding dissecting an ox or Jiu Fang Gao judging a horse: the Dao is present at a glance. This is what is meant by "cannot but transmit."

As for the unworthy, whose conduct contradicts principle, who fail to comprehend sacred texts and cling to their own views—such are those of whom Laozi spoke: "If it could be offered, none would fail to offer it to their lord; if it could be presented, none would fail to present it to their kin; if it could be transmitted, none would fail to transmit it to their descendants." Even if one wished to transmit it, how could it be done?

From youth, I admired the alchemical tortoise, seeking teachers far and wide. Many pointed to spurious texts forged by the Fang lineage since the Qin and Han, leading the blind with blindness, resulting in no small loss. Later in life, I met Master Huainan Wang, who bestowed upon me the *Scripture of Gold and Azure*. Thereafter, I visited famous mountains, witnessed numinous traces firsthand, and verified them against the sages without contradiction, finding them in perfect accord with the Great Dao without doubt.

Thus, I compiled the essentials of various schools to serve as a guiding principle—truly profound, clear, and illuminating. Yet fearing that scholars might still not awaken, I further arranged teachings on true lead and true mercury, the Flowery Pond and ablutions, the symbolism of the crucible and furnace, and the sequence of firing times. Wherever the schools differed in their explanations, I traced the underlying principles, and they aligned like tallying tokens. These are called *Essentials*, all derived from the transmissions of the ancients, never mere conjecture.

May all fellow aspirants find insight upon opening this scroll.

Written on the Day of the Middle Prime of the *guiwei* year of the Longxing era.
*Selecting Companions*

*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: Those who cultivate and refine the elixir must first comprehend celestial patterns above and terrestrial principles below, master yin and yang, exhaust the imagery of the hexagrams, and grasp the waxing and waning of seasonal qi, the ascent and descent of hours, the advance and retreat of firing times, and the methods of the crucible and furnace. Only then may they enter the gate of the dragon-tiger symbolic system, recognize the true Way of lead and mercury, and—while inwardly illuminating virtue and outwardly extending benevolence—unite their hearts with the elixir to naturally attain the true realm. Thus, the safeguarding of the returned elixir cannot be grasped in a single morning or evening.

For elixir refinement, three practitioners of pure emptiness must join in shared aspiration and vow, their sole hope the completion of the elixir. Before commencing, they must first purify themselves through fasting and offer libations to the vault of heaven. One attends to the crucible and furnace, adjusting water and fire. Another regulates yin and yang, altering the hexagrams of creation and transformation, advancing or retreating water and fire in accordance with the seasonal nodes. Each of the three duties must be performed without the slightest error.

Master Ye states: At midnight, all three must guard the work with reverent prayers. Though each has their assigned task, they must take turns in urgent moments, alternating rest during the night. For the firing process continues day and night without pause, and the hours stretch long like the sun and moon. Should the cultivators grow weary over time, the refinement may be compromised.

**2. Selecting the Site**
*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: Before commencing refinement, one must first select a site. Choose only land of blessed virtue, where the years and months are auspicious and the ground is pure. Sites such as ancient tombs, temple foundations, abandoned wells, ruined kilns, battlefields, or places defiled by childbirth or impurity must not be used. As Lord Yin of the Dark says: "Without the proper site, the work cannot proceed."

**3. The Elixir Chamber**
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: Select the direction of annual vigor. As Sima Ziwei notes: The chamber for elixir refinement should face the direction of the year’s vigor. Choose a quiet room—neither too large nor excessively high. It should be lofty yet not drafty, bright yet not leaky, situated high but sheltered from lowly disturbances. No sounds of roosters, dogs, weeping, flowing water, galloping horses, or places of punishment and execution should reach it. Only mountain forests, Daoist abbeys, or secluded chambers are suitable.

**4. Prohibiting Impurity**
Master Qingxia states: The chamber should face east, and no women, Buddhist monks or nuns, chickens, or dogs may enter. Let incense smoke rise without cease. Before entering, one must don fresh clothing and shoes and avoid consuming onions, garlic, or similar foods.
*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: Within the elixir chamber, incense must never be extinguished. Petition the Perfected Above with offerings of vegetarian fare, maintaining utmost purity and discipline.

**5. The Elixir Well**
*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: Once the elixir site is secured, seek the elixir well. The well is essential to elixir refinement, for day and night, water and fire are adjusted through it. Since ancient times, immortals who ascended left behind elixir wells to signify their urgency in refinement. Once the well is dug, prevent all impurity. After the water vein stabilizes, purge stagnant sediment, then expose it to the open sky so that starlight and moonlight may illuminate it. Only when the water settles and the earth’s color is reabsorbed may it be drawn. If the water is clear, white, and sweet-tasting, sourced from a yang vein, it is most efficacious for elixir circulation. If the water is turbid with black mud, yellow earth, or red veins, or if it tastes metallic, astringent, or fishy, these indicate mingled water veins, yin-yang stagnation, and unsuitability for refinement.
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: Use only fresh water. As Immortal Ge notes: Draw spring water for preparation, never mixing it with other sources. If a clear mountain spring is nearby, sweet water is unnecessary, but it must not be shared with others.

**6. Selecting Earth**
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: Immortal Ge says: The vessels for refinement, the earth for altars and furnaces, must all be pure. As Master Sima notes: The earth for the divine chamber cannot be ordinary soil. Seek it in places untrodden by human feet, within mountain caves or rock crevices. Taste it—if not salty or bitter, and if it is yellow, firm, and unlike common soil, it may be used.

**7. Preparing Charcoal**
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: Immortal Ge says: Burn hardwood in a clean kiln to make charcoal. Pound it ten thousand times with a pestle, mix with glutinous rice, and form into balls the size of chicken eggs. Dry them in the sun, then preheat in a fierce furnace until glowing red. Weigh them precisely and feed the fire gradually. If one ounce is required per phase, ensure a constant supply day and night. Adjust the quantity as needed.

**8. Adding Water**
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: As Master Sima notes: Boil water in new earthenware pots or iron cauldrons, maintaining a temperature akin to the human body. Add it gradually, never cold. As Huang’s *Golden and Azure Classic* states: Do not let the fire grow excessive; maintain proper weight. If the upper water crucible becomes too hot, keep it only warm, never boiling, lest errors arise.

**9. Blending Incense**
Master Qingxia states: Combine half a catty of *jiangzhen* incense, five taels of *danshen*, four taels of *suhe* incense, four taels of old wutong root, four taels of white sandalwood, half a catty of *chen* incense, and a small amount of *baijiao* incense. Mix with honey and form into balls the size of marbles. Burn one ball each day.

**10. The Altar Design**
*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: Beneath the furnace lies an altar, three tiers high, each divided into eight sides with eight gates.
*Like the Clouds Master* states: One foot south of the altar, bury one catty of raw cinnabar mixed with five inches of silk and vinegar. To the north, bury one catty of lime; to the east, one catty of raw iron; to the west, one catty of silver. Three feet above the medicine crucible, hang an ancient mirror. Before the twenty-eight lunar mansions and five planets, place a pure sword.

Before the furnace, place a basin of unused well water, replenishing it every seven days. Use a peachwood board, upon which rests an incense burner, positioned in each direction. Day and night, replenish until the fourth cycle, at which point the elixir will commune with the divine spirits. Should demons attempt to intrude, steadfastly guard the heart and recite the following prayer:

*"With reverence, we invoke the Primordial August Emperor and the Most High Lord Lao: may the workings of Heaven and Earth align, and all demons be kept at bay. Should they touch our sacred medicine, let the Lord of Heaven repel them. To the east, buried iron; to the south, raging fire; to the west, hidden men; to the north, standing Hu barbarians; above, a hanging mirror—all arrayed in accord with the Five Phases. May ghosts and spirits be powerless, the land at peace, and true immortals protect me. May the Dao remain steadfast and pure. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

**Thirteen Methods for Gathering Lead**
*The Fire Dragon Classic* states: The *Zhouyu* has a white beard; the Primordial Lord, silver hair. Untouched by common fire, they are celestial treasures, rarely seen in full. Seek them in pure marshlands—these are the two methods.

The *Zhouyu* is the White Tiger, its white beard naturally grown. The Primordial Lord is black stone, embraced by silver essence, resembling a beard or hair—called the Old Man’s Whiskers. Unmarred by fire, it is celestial silver. If unavoidable, use pure marshland ore untainted by earth, cast it into the great sea, and gather eight taels.

Explanation: For every fifty taels of silver, refine and extract ten taels of essence for the Golden Flower’s use in a single day. In a crescent moon furnace, stir with a thousand wheels until the surface boils clear. Add two taels of White Tiger, and after a moment, a substance like mica, golden and dazzling, will appear. Scoop it with an iron ladle. When exhausted, add another two taels, repeating until ten taels yield eight taels of essence. This is called the Water Tiger, also known as the Yellow Sprout or Golden Flower.

Lord Lao said: *"From red to black is true cultivation"*—this is the third method.

*The Record of the Three Alignments* states: When gathering the Yellow Sprout, one must choose a time when Metal flourishes, beginning at the White Dew. This refers to the roundness of Metal and the fullness of the Toad’s light—an auspicious moment for elixir refinement, which must occur in the eighth month.

Master Xu the Perfected said: *"Nurture the child in winter, begin in the eighth month, and with nine crucibles, gather the Yellow Sprout. By the tenth month, all depends on the balance of Water and Fire, the harmony of Yin and Yang, to naturally produce the numinous sprout. If Water and Fire are unbalanced, the lead’s foundation will be stolen, corrupting the sprout, rendering it unusable. The qi must also be fully received; if insufficient, the elixir will not submit."*

**Diagram for Drawing Forth Mercury**
Master Ge the Immortal states:

The Mercury-Flying Furnace is made of wood, serving as a platform four feet in height. Like the legs of a turtle, it stands over one foot tall to avoid earthly qi. The round crucible holds two *dou* and must not be removed from the fire. The eight-inch platform above the turtle-shaped base is fashioned according to the size of the crucible.

The *Fire Dragon Classic* states: *"To fly mercury, place it beneath cinnabar; a small amount of white sand is also acceptable. If using hardwood fire, one day and night suffice—three nights are unnecessary."* Any cinnabar residue that fails to fully sublimate should be retained. Cinnabar from the Xi, Gui, or Chen regions, if luminous, may also be called true mercury.

A note adds: *"Seal the lid of the crucible tightly with mud to prevent leakage. Then, affix a black pipe to the lid, guiding water into a basin above, so that mercury does not escape."*

The *Record of the Uniting of Sameness* states: *"The Reverted Elixir cannot form without a crucible."* Thus, the *Scripture of the Primordial Chaos* says: *"Kan (Water) rises as the medicine; Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth) serve as the crucible. When the four embrace, it is called the Lofty Key."* Qian is Metal, and Kan is Earth. As Earth generates Metal, it is termed the Golden Crucible—not that the crucible itself is made of metal, but that it is the chamber of the elixir. When the crucible is fully prepared, the myriad things are born within it. The crucible symbolizes the Central Palace, and the Central Palace pertains to Earth, which generates the myriad things; thus, the crucible is made of Earth.

Master Yin the Perfected said: *"One must seek the crucible in the Central Palace."* It is known that common clay is fired into a crucible, and for the inner chamber, *ji* (a binding agent) is also used. The length and width are determined at the time of crafting. If too wide, the qi of Water and Fire will not descend; if too narrow, the qi of Water and Fire will not circulate—adjust accordingly.

Once the crucible is obtained, a furnace must be prepared, for the furnace is the enclosure of the crucible. A crucible without a furnace is like a person without a dwelling or city walls—how can it be settled? Thus, the furnace secures the crucible and contains the fire’s qi.

The Sima clan records: *"Master Ge the Immortal received the oral formula and prepared a clay-and-fire crucible. Using porcelain powder from Poyang as white clay, he blended it and pounded it ten thousand times in a mortar to shape the crucible like an egg, twelve inches high. A lid was fitted to hold the ingredients within, then sealed with proper methods. The crucible was lined with mud, and a sturdy earthen basin served as the base to hold the medicine. The crucible was then inserted three-tenths into the basin, and the furnace was separately prepared inside and out. Finally, it was sealed with method-mud and dried before placing the crucible atop."*

**Medicinal Mud (Fourteen Ingredients):**
Yellow earth, clamshell powder, lime, red halloysite, and *shi ling*—six ingredients, each one *liang*, ground into powder and mixed with water for use, called Six-One Mud.

A note adds: *"If mixed with honey instead, it becomes even more tightly sealed and impervious to leakage."*

**Uncrossed Furnace**
**Crossed Furnace**

After collating with the authentic original, it was found that only the Crossed Furnace and Cauldron were to be used—precisely what Wei Boyang referred to as *"the steaming cauldron like a spirit."*

Master Qingxia said: *"Once the furnace and lower cauldron are constructed according to the pattern, enclose the walls and kindle the fire. First, a furnace sacrifice must be performed: three *jin* of clear wine, twelve jars of dried venison, one incense burner, and twelve portions of seasonal fruit. After the sacrifice, recite the invocation:

*'August Heaven above, Yellow Earth below,
Nurturing the myriad things to flourishing abundance.
The sacred pivot holds fast the essential axis,
The Emperor secures the cauldron, the Dark Maiden attends the furnace.
Harmonizing yin and yang to refine the precious elixir,
The radiance of the Three and Five subdues all demonic forces.
O Youth of the Upright Furnace, General of the Guarding Fire,
Six Jia marshals the troops, Chiyou protects the truth.
On this day of such-and-such month, I, disciple So-and-so,
offer this sincere libation.
I humbly invoke the Perfected Ones of the Grotto Realms and the Immortals of the Grasses,
granting silent aid—do not treat this lightly.'*

Bow twice.

**Nurturing for Fifteen Days**
Master Ge the Immortal said: *"Before the supreme medicine is refined, the method of nurturing must first be applied—subtle and profound. The embryo of primordial qi must be nourished to flourishing divinity. If anything is impure, all is lost in an instant; immortality and mortality diverge in a moment. How can one not be cautious?*

*Its method: use hard stone or jade to fashion a pestle and mortar. Grind the two substances, each eight* liang*, to restrain each other within the cauldron. Face east while grinding three thousand times, then gather the powder into a mass, calling it* 'Embryonic Radiance of the Primordial Beginning' *—revealing the form of Heaven and Earth before their emergence. Nurture it with supreme harmony to manifest the hidden workings of the divine.*

*Then place it in an earthen cauldron with a lid, sealed with method-mud. Once the mud is dry, set it in an ash pit and nurture it with civil and martial fire for seven days. When removed, if it appears purple, the process is complete. If the color is insufficient, the firing has been flawed. Prepare another ash pit and nurture it with civil and martial fire for twenty-one days, never leaving it for even a moment. Thus, refining the elixir requires no fewer than three people for nurturing.*

*Afterward, grind it again and place it in the cauldron. First, pack yellow earth firmly at the base, two* cun *and four* fen *thick, symbolizing the twenty-four qi. Set the two substances within and begin the firing.*

**The Central Embryo (Sixteen)**
Master Qingxia said: *"When the medicine lies in the cauldron, it is like a hen brooding an egg, a child in the womb, or fruit on a tree—once the qi is fully received, it ripens naturally. When the medicine enters the central embryo, utmost care must be taken to seal it tightly, lest the true qi leak away."*

*It is also said: "Seal the embryo without leakage, and transformation occurs in an instant." The central embryo’s construction is round like Heaven and Earth, rising like Penglai’s isle—closed and minutely sealed, with divine workings within.*

*The* Scripture of the Golden and Azure *states: "The furnace and cauldron take their form in solid enclosure, intricately restraining one another to ensure no mishap." Master Huang the Perfected commented: "The furnace, cauldron, and divine chamber restrain lead and mercury layer upon layer. Thus, the furnace gathers fire-qi to restrain the embryo, the embryo gathers fire-qi to restrain lead, and lead, receiving fire-qi, restrains mercury. Each restrains the other in turn. Only when the vessel is round and sealed can safety be assured."*

**Using Fire (Seventeen)**
Master Ruyunzi said: *"When applying fire, take seven solid stones, burn them until glowing red, then quench them in vinegar and toss them into the medicine chamber. Then take seven branches each of peach and willow from the southeast, burn them in pure fire as incense, and sincerely pray to comfort the hundred spirits, saying:*

*'Disciple So-and-so of the Great Dao humbly invokes the Primordial Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao. Now cultivating the supreme Way, I pray for the descent of the immortal banners and divine officials. May the local earth gods be at peace, inner demons unobstructed, and outer evils unassailing. May the great medicine swiftly form, granting eternal longevity.'*

*Conclude the prayer. After quieting the space, begin the fire at midnight, the hour of* zi*, ensuring no women, chickens, or dogs witness it. At ignition, use five* liang *of charcoal, burn it until glowing red, place it in the furnace, and cover it with ash. Do not neglect this by dawn.*

*The cauldron should resemble a chicken’s egg. The fire should be taken from sunlight; next, nanmu wood fire serves as the common fire, usable for nine years. No other fire may be used—this is called* 'Long Fire of Water and Fire.'*

*A note adds: "Fire begins at* wu *in the first month, water at* xu *in the first month, both moving in reverse through the six yang phases. The day of* chen *is the starting day for firing the elixir. Greatly avoid days of tidal birth, as well as* jia-xu*,* jia-wu*,* jia-chen*,* jia-yin*, and* jia-zi*."*

**Bathing (Eighteen)**
The *Elixir Formula* states: *"Mao and you are for bathing. All schools grind the medicine three thousand times in a mortar—this method is most subtle and wondrous, unattainable except by the perfected."*

*An ancient song says:*
*"A maiden in blue-green robes,
A gentleman in plain white silk.
If seen, it cannot be used;
If used, it cannot be seen."*

*The* Cui Gong’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Grind the dragon to powder,
Let the tiger inhale in balance."*

*The* Record of the Threefold Concordance *states: "The gates of* mao *and* you *at the second and eighth months are called the dead qi. The two and a half days before* mao *and after* you *are critical. Elixir masters greatly avoid introducing water or fire at these times."*

*Thus it is said: "This principle is profound and obscure, beyond mortal comprehension—truly divine and sacred. Without understanding this, how can one speak of refining the elixir?"*

**Fire Timing (Nineteen)**
The ancient method prescribes only ten months. Thus Master Qingxia said: *"Never has it been heard that a human embryo gestates for three years before birth."* Some methods take three years, but the principle remains the same—only the application differs.

The weight of fire is not fixed, for vessels vary in size and medicines in quantity. The key lies in carefully assessing the principles of yin and yang at the time, without the slightest error.

Master Huang the Perfected, in his commentary on the *Scripture of the Golden and Azure*, most thoroughly revealed the true mechanism of fire timing. Fearing that later students might still treat it lightly, he left this poem:

*"Things, when unrecognized, are deemed worthless;
Words of the profound and subtle are met with disdain."*

Last night, I leaned on the railing and sighed long,
For whom does the autumn moon shine so brightly in vain?
Alas! The sagely heart of benefiting and saving all is so profoundly efficacious.
Yet those of meager fortune abandon and harm themselves,
Their perverse views losing the true and upright.
How grievous! How lamentable!

**Opening the Crucible (Twenty)**
The *Record of the Uniting of Sameness* states: From the tenth month, one begins, proceeding to the fourth month, which pertains to the yang crucible, rotating left.
The annotation says: The crescent, full, waning, and new moons are the four phases of the sun and moon.
At dawn, within the dark essence, the bright spirit is born and becomes light—this is the sun’s first quarter.
After the first quarter, the spirit becomes the essence and the essence the function; within the spirit, another spirit arises, and the spirit grows—thus the sun reaches its fullness.
At fullness, within the bright spirit, the dark essence is born and becomes darkness—this is the sun’s last quarter.
After the last quarter, the essence becomes the essence and the spirit the function; within the essence, another essence arises, and the essence grows—thus the moon reaches its darkness.
Within a single month, spirit and essence alternate and return, never deviating from their measure.
The Perfected Huang used the moon to determine the fire timing—this principle is thus made clear.

The *Record of the Uniting of Sameness* states: From the fifth to the tenth month, it pertains to the yin crucible, rotating right.
When the elixir reaches its most trying moment, one must not for a moment abandon the chamber of medicine, but listen attentively to the dragon’s song.
Beyond this number of extreme yang, the elixir is without peril.
By the tenth month, the sun is complete, yang returns to Kun, and the elixir is accomplished—its color transforms to purple-gold, its radiance resplendent.
Nine revolutions complete the yang; the Five Phases are fully realized.

Master Ruyunzi said: When opening the crucible, one must fast, bathe, and purify oneself, don the Daoist robe, wear the star crown, face south, kneel to hold the medicine furnace, burn incense to cleanse the body, and pray with utmost sincerity.
Invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, and all the Perfected Lords of the Ten Directions.
This humble disciple, so-and-so, having completed the elixir in the crucible, follows the law of Heaven and Earth.
The yin winds disperse, the sun’s brilliance blazes forth, the pure yang transforms the body, and the Dragon and Tiger sustain it.
It ascends to the Purple Palace, forever departing the red dust.
When opening the crucible to retrieve the medicine, ensure no women, chickens, or dogs witness it.
That which flies white upon the crucible is the Purple-Gold Elixir; if red, it is the Dragon-Tiger Elixir.
That which encircles the four sides of the crucible is the Great Elixir.
The white, fish-scale-like flakes in the center are called the Divine Talisman White Snow.

**Ingestion (Twenty-One)**
Master Ruyunzi said: Enclose it in a ball of yellow wax, place it in east-flowing water, and soak for twenty-one days to dispel the fire toxin.
Then place it in a bamboo tube, wrap it in silk, and steam it within rice for one *fu* period to remove the water toxin.
Finally, boil it into a decoction and form pills the size of sesame seeds.
Offer them in sacrifice to the mountain.
