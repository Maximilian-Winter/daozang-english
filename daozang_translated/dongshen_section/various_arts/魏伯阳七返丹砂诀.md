Title of the Work: *Wei Boyang’s Seven Transformations of Cinnabar Elixir*.
Original Title: *The Yellow Boy’s Commentary*.
The *Song Dynasty Catalogue of Honored Literature (Song Chongwen Zongmu)* and the *Comprehensive Records of the Arts (Tongzhi Yiwen Lue)* both list *The Seven Transformations of the Soul Cinnabar Song (Qishuan Lingsha Ge)* in one volume, attributed to the disciple of Han Wei Boyang, with commentary by the Yellow Boy. This is the very text in question. It likely emerged in the late Northern and Southern Dynasties (Nanbei Chao) or early Sui-Tang period.

The *Tang Dynasty Treatise on the Seven Transformations of Soul Cinnabar (Qishuan Lingsha Lun)* by Chen Shaowei shares much the same content as this work. One volume.

**Wei Boyang’s Seven Transformations of Cinnabar Elixir**
*Commentary by the Yellow Boy*

The Dao/Way was born from the Heavenly Maiden,
The Heavenly Maiden—mercury—dwells in the Great Yin, hence called *Xuan* (Heavenly) Maiden.
The Earth produced the Yellow Male,
The Yellow Male—sulfur—is the essence of the Great Yang, hence called *Huang* (Yellow) Male.
Both inherit the nature of the Supreme Harmony,
And respond to the subtle, numinous *qi*.
This means both substances draw upon the pure, harmonious, and subtle *qi*.
The Yang defends the Yin, borrowing its position to reside.
Mercury, born from cinnabar, transforms into liquid mercury, residing in the Yin—this is borrowing its position.
The Yin returns to the Yang, restoring its original nature.
Refining mercury back into cinnabar—restoring its original nature.

Zhang and Weifei’s celestial exchange—this is the first transformation.
Zhang—southern constellation—Weifei—northern constellation.
Cinnabar transforms into mercury, mercury returns to cinnabar,
Shifting between south and north, altering its form—this is the first transformation.

Life-giving through seven returns, divine and boundless transformations.
Through seven cycles of refinement, it becomes divine and transformative.
The Great Yang’s white mercury inherently contains the red water.
Mercury originates from within cinnabar—hence, it contains the red water.
The mercury returns to its cinnabar essence—this is the union of exchange.
Mercury is the essence and fluid of cinnabar,
Its back-and-forth transformation is the union of forming elixir and returning to source.

The Primordial *qi* is vague and indistinct,
Transforming and taking form.
The pure *Yuanqi* (Primordial *qi*) and *Taiyi* (Supreme Unity) are vague and indistinct, without form,
Yet within, the numinous essence coalesces,
And generates the form of cinnabar and mercury.

Once the form is manifest,
It transforms into Yin essence.
From the void, it generates cinnabar and mercury,
Cinnabar resides in the Yang,
And then transforms into Yin—becoming liquid mercury.

Souls and spirits disperse,
Yet return and bind to one another.
The Yin and Yang disperse,
Yet return and bind—this is the symbol of boundless transformation.
Having established the forms of Yin and Yang,
It ascends and returns to the Upper Palace.
The Upper Palace is the southern realm;
Having established the forms of Yin and Yang,
It ascends, transforms, and returns to its southern source palace.
Once the Primordial *qi* is void and indistinct,
It governs all things.
Cinnabar and mercury are the Primordial *qi*,
Void yet generating transformation,
Until they become liquid mercury.
Now, no longer confused,
They return to their source palace—
This is the Dao/Way’s origin,
And its governance over all transformations.

Moreover, when the two natures harmonize,
They become husband and wife,
Son and mother,
Lord and subject.
The two natures harmonized cannot be counted—
Each is singular, yet boundless.
Now, having obtained the talisman and control,
You command them as water extinguishes fire—
Their form naturally returns,
And they descend to the Earthly realm.

**Ten Verses**

The crucible is round and firm, the porcelain vessel fully luminous.
A single crucible, with a lid—
A harmonious, static, and firm vessel.
The top and bottom correspond, interlocking like teeth.
The top and bottom align,
Hidden yet perfectly matched.

The third part of the whole—
This is the constant of Heaven and Earth.
Divide the elixir ingredients into thirds—
Conforming to Heaven and Earth’s natural measure.

An inch in diameter, broad or narrow,
Holds a little over one *sheng*.
The vessel can contain one and a half *sheng*—
This is twenty-four *liang* of medicine.

Not confined to high hills or low valleys,
Nor limited to *yuanyang*’s domain.
Do not discard the Pure Primordial—
The outer clay is urgent.

The outer clay’s earth,
Unbound by height or depth,
Must be of pure soil.

Use vine tendrils to stir and blend,
Ensuring thorough integration.
With vine paper as the sinew,
Ensure their fusion.

Seal it twice,
Each time exhausting internal moisture.
Apply clay to the crucible twice,
Each time waiting until dry.

Measure the *zhu* and *liang* precisely,
As melting and refining harmonize.
Determine the weight,
Then cast into fire—
In an instant, they naturally blend.

Now purple, now yellow,
Sometimes white, sometimes black.
In the melting process,
Colors shift unpredictably.

Stirring the chaos,
Unchanging in south or north.
At the critical moment,
The two substances merge—
Indivisible, never to part.

Heaven and Earth’s natural transformations
Are the sages’ guiding principle.
They follow the subtleties of the Great Void,
Creating movement as law.

Fire is the sole foundation,
Oyster shell powder must be moist.
Establish the method—
Only fire makes it excellent,
Oyster shell powder’s luster is its marvel.

But let it be firm and dense,
No need for five-to-two ratios.
Ancients used seven flavors and six-to-one clay—
This method discards the old ways.

When the moment arrives, seal it,
Then draw in the *qi*.
Close it tightly,
Next, draw in the internal *qi* completely,
Then seal it.

The sages’ transmitted method
Lies in the ebb and flow of intent.
Though past masters grasped the method,
At the moment of practice,
They observed the transformations,
Judging carefully by intent.

First, establish the city walls,
Then complete the martial array.
Perform the Five Phases’ gentle fire first,
To set the *qi*’s boundaries.
Then apply the Six Times’ fierce fire,
To perfect its essence.

Radiance ascends and descends,
Awe-inspiring with patterns.
As the form dissolves,
The spirit essence transforms.
Pressured by gentle fire,
The upper and lower shift—
Melting and refining,
Becoming sacred sand.

The enlightened find it easy,
The confused struggle.
Error lies in extraction or addition,
Success in receiving *qi*.
A difference of a single *zhu*,
Forever separates one from the Dao.

Those who extract mercury or add sulfur
Are mistaken.
All are lost to the Way,
Falling into delusion,
Unaware of *qi*’s true source.

The art of immortality
Is not mere technique—it must be kept secret.
I transmit to the Celestial Master,
Carved on the *Kongtong* stone record.

From ancient times to now,
Scholars by the thousands
Fail to grasp its essence,
Exhausting their fortunes in pursuit.

To know its core,
One must master the Three Flowers.
The Three Flowers—fire.
Its essence lies in timing and intent.
Without this key,
All effort is in vain.

Chaos returns to obscurity,
Dispersing like scattered clouds.
Then it reverses—
Chaos returns to obscurity,
Suddenly like clouds dispersing,
Forming elixir clouds.

To achieve spiritual penetration,
Seven transformations are supreme.
To reverse and attain eternal life,
Seven cycles must forge the elixir sand—
This is the ancient gods’ safeguard.

Its hue surpasses cinnabar’s glow,
Its radiance rivals the sun’s.
Ancient sages’ secret transmission,
The essence of immortality.

The medicine, once formed,
Submerge in cold springs seven days,
Driving away the sun’s heat.
Then steam it three days,
Warding off yin toxicity,
Only then fit for consumption.

Grind it finely—
This is the standard method.
Pill it like mung beans,
Not too large.
Grind it meticulously,
Pill it like peas,
Not too coarse.

Take three grains each dawn,
Beginning on *jiazi* day.
On this medicine’s first day,
At dawn, face south,
Sit still and composed,
With wine, swallow three grains.
Visualize the medicine as crimson clouds
Descending from heaven into the five *zang*,
The clouds dispersing through the four limbs.
Hold your breath for thirty-six breaths,
Tap your teeth thirty-six times.
At the moment of transformation,
The medicine enters the limbs—
Ears and eyes sharpen,
This is its effect.

After a thousand days,
Spiritual penetration is complete.
Following the method faithfully,
Each day’s dose fulfilled,
Your vision knows no night or day,
Ghosts cannot hide their forms,
You recite ten thousand words daily.
Your complexion red and white,
Like a child’s.

Your spirit calms, your breath steadies.
A thousand autumns—no death.

When the spirit is calmed and the mind composed,
Entering the Nine Chambers,
Eternal life is attained—
The Dao is complete.

Thus concludes the *Wei Boyang’s* Seven Refining Secrets of *dansha*.
