**Gold and Flower Elixir of Great Dao (Jinhua Yuye Dadan)**

**Title:** *Jinhua Yuye Dadan* (Gold and Flower Elixir of Great Dao)
**Author:** Unknown, likely from the Song Dynasty (似出宋代)
**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), *Dongshen Bu* (Cavernous Deity Section), *Zhongshu Lei* (Miscellaneous Arts Category)

**One Volume**

**Method:**
Cinnabar (朱砂) – 1 *jin* (斤), use only the most luminous tenth (十分光明者用).
Collect the following herbs at their respective times:
- *San You Mu* (三友木, Three Companions Wood) in the second month (二月收)
- Fresh lotus leaves (新荷叶) in the fourth month (四月收)
- *Mazhen Cao* (马鞭草, Horsetail Herb) in the eighth month (八月收)

Burn each into ash (烧灰), measuring roughly one *dou* (斗) each. Extract the most concentrated juice (十分浓汁) from the ashes. Boil the cinnabar in this juice for one month (一月). After 360 *zhi* (跻, a unit of time, likely "days"), the cinnabar will turn snow-white (雪白色), named *Yuying* (玉英, Jade Essence). Consuming it can cure all ailments (可治百病).

**Boiling Method:**
Place the cinnabar (前朱) in a small bottle (小瓶内). Fill eight-tenths (八分) with the juice of the three herbs' ashes (三草灰汁). Add finely chopped fresh ginger (梼碎生姜), wrap it in cloth (用布包), and seal the bottle's mouth (塞瓶口). Boil in a covered pot (重汤煮之). Daily, remove the cinnabar and use *zaojiao* (皂角, soapberry) to boil it for another day (煮一日), refining it until it becomes milky (乳细). Wash it with flowing water (长流水) five to seven times (淘五七次).

**Nourishing Method:**
Use the following six minerals (六石), each refined with vinegar (醋淬) and finely ground (梼碎):
- *Yangqi Shi* (阳起石, Yangqi Stone)
- *Cishi* (磁石, Magnetite)
- *Yuyu Gen* (禹余根, Yuyu Root, a mineral)
- *Shidai Zhe Shi* (石代赭石, Vermilion Stone)
- *Zishi Ying* (紫石英, Amethyst)
- *Yushi* (誉石, a mineral, possibly Calcite)

Blend these minerals with the juice of *xiaoshi* (硝石, saltpeter) and *Taiyin Xuanying* (太阴玄精, Yin Essence of the Dark Primordium, possibly a mineral or alchemical term) until they become milky (俱乳细), forming the outer casing (外匮).

Further, use 12 *liang* (两) of silver to create the *Shenshi* (神室, Divine Chamber). Place the refined cinnabar inside (置前朱於中), then insert the outer casing (纳入外置砂合). Seal it tightly (封固如法) and place it atop a furnace (灰池顶火) to be nourished by fire for one month (养一月), adjusting the flame to 2–4 *liang* (两) of fuel daily (火候二至四两). Remove it daily (日足取出), naming the result *Yuye* (玉液, Jade Elixir), which can transmute copper into silver (点铜成银) and lead into treasure (坚铅成宝).

**Next Process:**
Use the *Yuye* (玉液) to create another *Shenshi* (神室, Divine Chamber) with 12 *liang* (两) of gold (以金十二两作神室). Place the *Yuye* inside (纳其中), seal it with the outer casing (外以前匮固之), and insert it into a sand mixture (入砂合), sealing it as before (封固如法). Nourish it atop the furnace (灰池) with fire for another month (养一月), adjusting the flame to 4–6 *liang* (两) of fuel daily (火候四至六两). Remove it daily (日足取出), and its appearance will be greenish-brown (绿褐色), like dust on a bright window (如明窗尘), named *Zifen* (紫粉, Purple Powder). Each half *chú* (铢) can dry 1 *liang* (两) of mercury (乾汞一两), producing *Geng* (庚, a refined metal, possibly silver or gold).

**Application:**
Use the *Zifen* (紫粉) with decoctions of *Han Jiao* (汉椒, Sichuan Pepper) and *Fangji* (防己, Stephania Root) for bathing (沐浴少时).

**Further Refinement:**
Use 12 *liang* (两) of silver for the inner *Shenshi* (神室, Divine Chamber), with a ratio of 3 parts female to 4 parts male (雌三雄四). Grind them together (一处和研) and place them inside the inner chamber (入内神室中). Use 16 *liang* (两) of gold for the outer *Shenshi* (神室, Divine Chamber), placing the *Zifen* inside (纳紫粉於其中). Insert the inner chamber into the outer one (内神室入外神室), and then place the outer chamber into the previous casing of the eight minerals (外神室入前八石匮中). Seal it with sand (沙合封固) and nourish it with fire for one month (养火一月), adjusting the flame to 2–6 *liang* (两) of fuel daily (火候二至六两). Open and close it daily (日足开合), and both the silver chamber and the purple powder will turn yellow like gold (俱成黄色金), named *Jinhua* (金华, Golden Flower).

Each half *chú* (铢) of *Jinhua* can dry 1 *liang* (两) of mercury (乾汞一两), producing *Geng* (庚, refined metal).

**Final Process:**
From this point onward, the eight minerals are no longer used (去八石不用). Instead, take the *Jinhua* (金华) and the male-female refined substances (内养出牡牝), grind them together (一处和研) to form the outer casing (作外匮). Use 16 *liang* (两) of gold to create another *Shenshi* (神室, Divine Chamber), placing 10 *liang* (两) of fresh cinnabar inside (纳生朱十两於其中). Place this within the *Jinhua* casing (置在金华匮内), seal it with sand (砂合封固), and arrange it atop the furnace as before (如法灰池). Nourish it with the *Liuyang* (六阳, Six Yang) fire for 49 days (六阳火养四十九日), opening and closing it daily (开合), until the *Jinhua* turns purple-gold (紫金色), becoming the *Changsheng Kuang* (长生匮, Elixir of Extended Life).

If the cinnabar resembles *Danfan* (胆矾, copper sulfate) in color (朱砂如胆矾色), it is named *Zixia Dan* (紫霞丹, Purple Cloud Elixir). Each half *chú* (铢) of this refined cinnabar, made into pills with *chou zhi* (楮汁, paper mulberry juice), can dry 5 *liang* (两) of mercury (糁汞五两), producing gold (成黄金). It can also transmute the five metals (化五金), all becoming treasures (俱可成宝), with endless transformations (生生变化无穷).

**Silver Elixir (Yin Jing Dan)**

**Ingredients:**
- Cinnabar (朱砂) – 4 *liang* (两)
- *Fen Shuan* (粉霜, Powdered Frost) – 6 *liang* (两)
- *San You Shuang* (三友霜, Frost of Three Companions) – half *jin* (半斤)

**Method:**
As with refining frost (如炼霜), wrap the cinnabar in a linen bag (以夹布袋盛朱) and suspend it during boiling (悬胎煮为妙).

Take mulberry twig ash (桑柴烧灰), extract its concentrated juice (淋取浓汁), and refine it with gentle fire (以软火炼之). Place a handful of rice straw (一握稻草) in the pot, and the juice will condense into frost (其汁自结霜在上). Wash the frost with clean water (以清水汹之), evaporate it again, and it will become powdered frost (再熬乾成霜).

Spread the powdered frost (粉霜) at the base, then on all sides and the center. Place the cinnabar inside (入朱砂在内), and cover it with more powdered frost (仍以粉霜盖之). Next, cover with mulberry ash frost (桑灰霜) and a tile (盖瓦片), seal the mouth with *Liuyi* (六一, Six-to-One) clay (泥), and build the furnace (固灰池). Nourish with yang fire (阳火) for seven days (养七日), adjusting the flame to 9 *liang* (两) of fuel daily (火候九两). Open and close it daily (日足开合), and the cinnabar will turn snow-white like silver flakes (其色雪白如银屑), with marvelous results (妙甚).

**Note:**
This can replace the *Jinhua Dadan* (金华大丹) as the initial alchemical substance (金曾以此代金华大丹头), and its efficacy is equal (其功与之并驾). This method is recorded here for reference (今书此以记之).

**Four Holy Elixirs (Si Sheng Dan)**

**Ingredients:**
- *Bi* (毗) – 8 *liang* (两)
- *Fen* (粉) – 6 *liang* (两)
- *Xiong* (雄) – 3 *liang* (两)
- *Ci* (雌) – 3 *liang* (两)

**Refinement of *Bi*:**
Boil *Bi* (毗) with *Musu* (募苏, likely a herb) juice, using 2 *huai* (槐, a measure) of the former and 3 *huai* (槐) of the latter (募苏汁二槐, 旱莲汁三槐). After boiling it to exhaustion (煮尽), wash it clean (洗净).

Further, boil *Bi* with half *huai* (半槐) of *Musu* juice until fully fried (炒尽为度).

**Refinement of *Fen*:**
Boil 3 *jin* (斤) of *Xunsu* (寻苏, likely a herb) juice to exhaustion (浓煎汁煮尽), using 6 *liang* (两) of powdered substance (粉).

**Refinement of *Xiong*:**
Boil 2 *jin* (斤) of *Yashi Cao* (鸭舌草, Duck-tongue Herb) in water, using rice washings (上下米浴水) to exhaust it (侵煮尽), for 3 *liang* (两) of male substance (雄).

**Refinement of *Ci*:**
Boil roughly 2 *jin* (斤) of *Zisu Cao* (紫苏草, Purple Perilla Herb) in vinegar with rice bran (米糠醋煎汁) until exhaustion (煮尽), for 3 *liang* (两) of female substance (雌).

Take 6 *liang* (两) of powdered substance (粉) and mix it with 6 *liang* (两) of mountain or river silver (山泽银), grinding into a fine powder (搅为末). Place 4 *liang* (两) of this powder at the base of a fire crucible (火鼎底), and use another 2 *liang* (两) of silver powder (银末) to seal the top (捺头). Insert the crucible into a water-fire furnace (水火鼎), sealing it tightly as before (如法通身固济).

For each *liang* (两) of powdered substance (粉), add half *liang* (半两) of mercury (汞) to its feet (加了脚), blending them together (同缎). If used in a decoction (如用汤煮过), boil it as needed (用之).

**Sealing Method:**
Use *Wuming Yimai Fen* (无名异蚁粉, Powder of Nameless Ants), *Zhijin* (纸筋, Paper Fibers), and salt clay (盐泥), grinding them finely together (同梼千万下).

Level the ash (灰) and build the furnace (筑鼎), exposing the water crucible (倒露出水鼎) and the place where the mixture is inserted (及受缎处).

**Firing Process:**
First, ignite 1 *jin* (斤) of fire, and after two hours (二时), lift the crucible. Use a *Watao* (瓦陀, likely a type of clay pot or furnace) vessel, raising it half an inch (半寸许), and ignite another hour (下火簇缎一个时). Repeat this process four times (添尽四个瓦陀子), each time lifting after one hour (各过一时、提起). Add one or two pieces of charcoal (炭) to the base, allowing the medicine to absorb the heat (令药受毁), with a total of three *jin* (斤) of fire. Surround the furnace with tiles (瓦围了), and add another *jin* (斤) of fire.

This completes the full preparation (此是全料). When the fire reaches this stage (火候到此), carefully use the elixir (消详用之).

Finally, cover the furnace with ash (灰盖) and let it cool. Remove the powdered mother substance (粉母) from the crucible (分胎).

Right, grind the powder finely and mix it evenly with *Pí* (毘, likely cinnabar) and grind it together into the crucible.

Leave two *liǎng* (两) of *Pí* (毘), and use vinegar to search and knead the head for solidification, nurturing the fire for **37 days** (三七日). The fire dosage for the first **37-day cycle** (一七火候) is as follows: two *liǎng* on the first day, two and a half *liǎng* on the second day, and four *liǎng* from the third to the seventh day.

When the cycle is complete, cool the furnace and retrieve it, grinding thoroughly before returning it to the crucible. Repeat the process as before for **one refining** (一缎), then remove and grind finely into a container, refilling it again. This refining does not require the use of the original mother substance.

The fire dosage for the second **37-day cycle** (二七火候) is: two *liǎng* on the first day, two and a half *liǎng* on the second day, three *liǎng* on the third day, two and a half *liǎng* on the fourth day, four *liǎng* on the fifth day, four *liǎng* in the morning and four *liǎng* in the evening on the sixth day, five *liǎng* in the morning and six *liǎng* in the evening on the seventh day, with two *liǎng* at the top and four *liǎng* on each side.

For the **initial and final stages** (首尾三斤), retrieve the substance, grind it finely, and return it to the crucible. Refine it again as before for **one refining** (一缎), then remove and grind finely into a container, refilling it once more with a new batch of charcoal. The fire dosage for the third **37-day cycle** (三七火候) is: two *liǎng* on the first day, three *liǎng* on the second day, four *liǎng* on the third day, five *liǎng* on the fourth day, and five *liǎng* on the fifth day. On the sixth day, five *liǎng* are used. On the seventh day, refine as before (就缎), with **three *jin* (斤) of incense** (末香) and two charcoal clusters (炭团), finely mixed and placed on the four sides, nurturing the fire with six *liǎng* of fuel.

Arrange it according to the five directions (按五方安之), cover with four tiles (瓦), and leave the top open for smoke. After three days, cool the furnace and then retrieve it. This can be used for nurturing **male and female powders** (匮养雌雄粉).

**First Transformation (一转变化):**
For each *liǎng* (两) of powder, first boil it with **lotus ash solution** (荷灰汁) for one day. Then mix it with water and **white lead** (白友) powder, wrapping each particle individually, and fry it with **Gé* (莒蒲, likely a type of grass or herb) powder for about a day. Remove it, discard the white lead, and grind the powder finely. Add half a *liǎng* of **red lead** (赤了, likely red cinnabar or red arsenic) and mix evenly. Combine with one *liǎng* of **silver powder** (银粉), and refine it according to the previous method for nurturing powder (如前法缎粉).

Retrieve the powder and return it to the **silver chamber** (银室), covering it with the previous container (依前匮覆籍), and nurture the fire for **77 days** (养火七七日). For each *qian* (钱) of powder, one can refine **four *liǎng* of bone** (骨), achieving a **fully refined powder** (十分彻糁) that does not exceed the **lead pool** (铅池, likely a reference to a specific alchemical grade).

**Second Transformation (二转变化):**
Grind **powdered cinnabar** (辰汞) into a fine frost as per the original method. Also, as before, boil the **silver mother** (银母) in lotus ash solution (荷灰汁煮), refine the **silver chamber** (缎银室), and nurture it until completion.

For each *liǎng* of refined **powdered cinnabar** (养死辰汞), add four *qian* of male (雄) and two *qian* of female (雌), grinding evenly. Use **Gēng mother** (庚母, likely a type of furnace or container) as the **divine chamber** (神室), placing the male and female powders inside, and nurture the fire.

Use the **Four Holy Immortals’ Pill** (四圣丹) as the outer container (作外匮), with fire dosage of four *liǎng*. Change the fire in the morning and evening for **21 days** (二十一日早晚换火). When complete, cool the furnace and retrieve the **male and female powders** (雌雄粉). Each *qian* can refine **one *liǎng* of silver** (银), achieving the highest grade of gold (上等金).

**Third Transformation (三转乾汞):**
Use the **male and female powders** (养死雌雄粉) refined as before, placing them inside the **gold chamber** (金室).

Take **large luminous cinnabar** (大光明颗块砂), first **calcined with bile** (先用胆炮) and **mulberry leaf juice** (硫桑汁), boiling it for **three periods of heat** (三伏时). Retrieve it and dry it, wrapping it in gold leaf (金箔包了), and planting it within the male and female powders. Use the **Four Holy Immortals’ Pill** (四圣丹) as the outer container (作外匮), sealing and nurturing the fire for **77 days** (养火七七日), with fire dosage ranging from two to six *liǎng*. When complete, retrieve the substance: one *qian* of **cinnabar** (朱) can refine **four *liǎng* of dry cinnabar** (乾汞), producing the finest gold (上等金).

**Six Divine Containers’ Method (六神匮):**
Use **mallow leaves** (马苋菜) and **willow leaves** (柳叶) with *Pí* (毘) to refine the juice, boiling it for five days until completion. Refine it with **grass balls** (草球).

For each *liǎng* of *Pí* (毘), use **half-summer** (半夏) and **grass wu** (草乌) two *liǎng* each, spreading them out, and refine with **two *jin* of fire** (二斤火缎).

Mix it with **onion juice** (葱管内), and place it inside **lotus root holes** (藕窍中). Seal both ends with mud (泥固两头), and refine with **two *jin* of fire** (二斤火毁).

Use **borax** (硼) one *liǎng*, boiling it with **white alcohol** (白酒脚) in a cup (一盏), until the powder is exhausted. Boil **mountain gardenia** (山栀子), **small asarum** (细辛), **thunder peach** (雷亢), and **bottle gourd** (瓜篓) for **five 37-day cycles** (五七日). Refine it with **wolfberry** (川狼毒), **pomegranate peel** (石榴皮), **ghost peach** (鬼旧), **five-fold childberry** (五倍子), and **stone wedelia** (石韦) wrapped and refined.

Take four *liǎng* of powder, and for each, use one *liǎng* of the aforementioned substances, mixing them with **onion juice** (乳) to form a powder. Place them into a container (装入合).

Add **locust bean gum** (蜻油) one cup (一盏), and nurture the fire for seven days with fire dosage of two *liǎng*. Retrieve it, add another cup of locust bean gum, and nurture the fire for another seven days with fire dosage of three *liǎng*. Retrieve it again, add another cup of locust bean gum, and nurture the fire for seven days with fire dosage of four *liǎng*. Repeat this process for **three 37-day cycles** (如此养三七日了), and the medicine will be ready for nurturing in the container (其药作匮养物).

Use seven *liǎng* of powder, and for each, use seven *liǎng* of **mercury** (汞), adding two *liǎng* of mother substance (入母二两), forming it into sand (结成砂). Mix it with powder and grind finely. Retrieve it from the **negative yin cave** (负阴窟), and divide it into granules (分开作颗块), applying **red lead** (赤了脚) to the surface. Place it inside the previous container using the **lotus method** (入前匮栽莲法), nurturing the fire for **21 days** (养法二十一日), with fire dosage ranging from two to three *liǎng*. Retrieve half a *qian* of powder to refine **one *liǎng* of bone** (骨), achieving **Dan Yang** (丹阳, a refined alchemical grade).

**Alone Method (独础匮变化):**
Use **wolfberry** (川狼毒) to boil *Pí* (毘) for half a *jin* (半斤), over two periods of time (两个时候). Use **mulberry leaf juice** (梧桐律半斤) to mix and refine with *Pí* (毘), achieving a **jade-like green** (碧玉色). Grind it finely and place it in the furnace, nurturing the fire for seven days. Its color will become **snow-white** (雪白), and then it can be transformed, used for nurturing in the container.

**Method for Pointing Gold (－点金):**
Use **two *liǎng* of calamine** (蒲矾), **five *liǎng* of yellow alunite** (黄矾), **two *liǎng* of mulberry bark** (桐律), **one *liǎng* of calcined** (炮), **one *liǎng* of green vitriol** (青盥), **one *liǎng* of refined salt** (解盐), **two *liǎng* of female mercury** (雌黄), and **half a *liǎng* of mineral oil** (石油).

Wrap these ingredients in **immortal’s grass** (仙人草), warm them to form a solution, and open it to reveal a luminous, pleasing color. Mix **paper mulberry juice** (楮汁) into a ball the size of a **bullet** (弹子大), wrap it with **gold foil** (金泊裹了), and place it inside the previous container to nurture for one day, or three days.

Retrieve it and grind finely into a powder. Form **yellow wax pills** (黄腊丸) the size of a **chicken head** (鸡头大). Use four *qian* or five *qian* of the aforementioned substances, combined with **one *jiao* of the elixir** (对丹一九), to point and refine **bone to its true color** (骨十二分真色) to twelvefold transparency. If refined with **three 37-day cycles** (三七勾之), it is even more wondrous.

**Cave Method (庵法):**
Use **equal parts of saltpeter** (牙硝), **white alunite** (白矾), **stone alunite** (石盥), and **leech powder** (鳝粉), mixing them with **brine** (盐卤) to activate and ignite them. The color will emerge.

Another method:
Use **immortal’s grass** (仙人草), **croton seed** (巴豆), **five-fold childberry** (五倍), **stemona root** (百部), **bone supplement** (骨补), **wolfberry** (川乌), **grass wu** (草乌), **half-summer** (半夏), **south starwort** (南星).

「**Nurturing Powder (养粉):**
Each powdered batch consists of eight *qian* of the substance, two *qian* of true **mercury** (真汞), and two *qian* of the **mother** (母), formed into sand. When ground finely into paste, it is rolled with **paper mulberry juice** (楮汁) into pills the size of a **dragon eye** (龙眼大). Wrapped further in **mother foil** (母箔), they are placed in the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) and nurtured by fire for three **7-day cycles** (三七日), until one *qian* can transmute **one *liang* of cinnabar** (丹阳一两) into powder.

**Nurturing Vermilion (养朱):**
For each batch, take one *liang* of **raw vermilion** (生朱) and one *liang* of **raw pyrite** (生毗) as a foil. Mix with two *liang* of **mother sand** (二八母砂), wrapping tightly, then place in the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) to nurture by fire for three **7-day cycles** (三七日), until it becomes **precious** (宝). Alternatively, one *qian* can transmute **one *liang* of bone** (骨一两).

**Nurturing Gunpowder Bladder (养炮胆):**
For each batch, use two *qian* of **gunpowder** (炮) and eight *qian* of **bladder** (胆), refining to produce one *liang* of **powdered frost** (粉霜). Mix and press into a **sealed base** (合底), with **gold foil** (金箔) layered between. Place in the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) with a **pressed lid** (捺头), nurturing by fire for two **7-day cycles** (二七日) or one **7-day cycle** (一七日), until two *qian* can transmute **one *liang* of *Geng Dao* mercury** (庚道一两).

**Nurturing Male and Female (养雌雄):**
For each batch, take four *qian* of **female** (雌) and six *qian* of **male** (雄), ground into powder. Roll with **honey** (蜜) into pills the size of a **round eye** (圆眼大), wrapped in **gold foil** (金箔). Then take one *liang* of the previously refined **vermilion** (朱), finely ground and wrapped, and place it in the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) to nurture by fire for three **7-day cycles** (三七日), until one *qian* can transmute **one *liang* of the substance**, turning white into yellow.

**Vermilion and Mercury Sealed in the Four Divine Crucibles (四神匮) for Nurturing (芽养朱为糁制):**
Four *liang* of **vermilion** (朱砂), cooked with **large fishy *vicia* grass** (大鱼腥草) and **He Shou Wu** (何首乌) for three days, then **sifted** (一缎), are placed in the **mother crucible** (母养) for one month to become **precious** (宝).

**Fire and Water Balance (火候常存):**
Use **vermilion** (朱) cooled into a **tortoise shell** (陀) form. Pour over two *liang* of **mercury** (汞), nurturing by fire for one month. The **fire and water balance** (火候) is maintained as follows: one *liang* for two **6-day cycles** (一六日), two *liang* for three **6-day cycles** (二六日), three *liang* for four **6-day cycles** (三六日), four *liang* for five **6-day cycles** (四六日), and five *liang* for six **6-day cycles** (五六日), totaling **120 *liang* of fire** (火共计百二十两).

Alternatively, pour over one *liang* of **mercury** (汞) and nurture as above for one month, maintaining the **upper fire, lower water** (上火下水) balance. Repeat this process until five *liang* are poured. Then switch to a **water-fire crucible** (水火鼎), pour another *liang* of **mercury**, and nurture as before for one month. Continue this until seven *liang* are poured.

Next, add one *liang* of **vermilion** (朱砂) and nurture by fire for one month. Repeat this nine times, maintaining the **upper water, lower fire** (上水下火) balance. After nine months, the **yellow sprout** (黄芽) is obtained, totaling ten *liang* (十两). In the tenth month, **detach the embryo** (脱胎), placing it in the **Four Divine Crucibles** (四神匮) for nurturing.

**Four Divine Crucible Method (四神匮法):**
**Realgar** (雄黄) is refined with **mugwort** (艾) to **eight-tenths of true death** (八分死了), then further nurtured to achieve **true death** (真死). It is cooked with **wild rhubarb** (野薄苛), then **sifted** (缎) with **female** (雌), and nurtured to **death** (死). Next, it is cooked with **unopened *tripterygium* flower and *southern starwort* grass** (即踯躅花未惊草), and refined with **sulfur** (硫), nurtured to **death** (死). Then, cooked again with the aforementioned **grass** (前草), **vermilion** (朱砂) is added, and nurtured to **death** (死).

Afterward, take the **sprout** (芽子), add two *liang* of **true mercury** (真汞), and mix with **mother sand** (付斤) to form a **chamber** (室). The **sprout** (芽子) is placed in the **Four Divine Crucible** (四神匮), nurtured for one month, then **repeatedly refined** (一至十五) until fifteen cycles are complete. When the **original number of days is fulfilled** (元之数日足), the **sprout** (芽子) is used as the crucible, with **gold foil-wrapped vermilion** (金箔包朱砂) placed inside. Nurture by fire for three **7-day cycles** (七七日), maintaining the **fire and water balance** (火候) from four to eight *liang* of **vermilion** (朱), until it is ready for **sifting** (糁制).

**Sulfur and Mercury for Nurturing Male and Transmuting Gold (硫黄汞为匮养雄点金):**
Ten *liang* of **dead sulfur** (死硫), layered with three *liang* of **thick gold foil** (厚金泊), are nurtured by fire for seven days until the sulfur achieves **true death** (真死). Then, add **raw sulfur** (生硫) and nurture it to **death** (死), forming the crucible.

Separately, refine **three 7-day mother sand** (三七母砂) into **sprout** (芽), maintaining the **fire and water balance** (火候) as follows: one *liang* for two days (一日二两), two *liang* for three days (三日四两), three *liang* for five days (五日三两), and four *liang* for six or seven days (六七日四两), or six *liang*.

Take the **sprout** (芽子), cover its head with **sulfur** (硫黄), and nurture for two **7-day cycles** (二七日), then **sift** (一缎) until the **sprout** achieves **true death** (真死). Combine it with **sulfur** (硫黄) in a **balanced crucible** (对停), forming the **embryo crucible** (合胎为匮), and nurture four *liang* of **Geng sand** (庚砂).

The **Geng sand** (庚砂) is prepared by grinding **vermilion gunpowder** (朱炮胆) into powder as a **foil** (贴身), placed inside **prunus mume kernel** (梅核), and nurtured by fire for seven days, maintaining the **fire and water balance** (火候) as before.

Take two *liang* of **male** (雄), which is first boiled in **bladder white water** (胆白水) for one day, then cooked with **green alunite** (青矾) for half a day. Afterward, it is ground with **dead Geng sand** (死庚砂), a small amount of **gunpowder** (炮) added, and rolled with **honey** (蜜) into pills. Nurture by fire for two **7-day cycles** (二七日), maintaining the **fire and water balance** (火候) as follows: two *liang* for one or two days (一二日二两), three *liang* for three to five days (三四五日三两), four *liang* for six to nine days (六七八九十日四两), five *liang* for ten or twelve days (十一十二日五两), and six *liang* for thirteen or fourteen days (十三十四日六两).

When removed, use two *qian* to transmute **one *liang* of holy silver** (圣银) into **yellow gold** (黄矣).

**Holy Silver Method (圣银法):**
**Holy silver** (圣银) is obtained by nurturing **soul sand** (灵砂) with **sulfur** (硫黄). Use **gunpowder** (炮) to refine **Geng Dao mercury** (庚道).

**Gunpowder (炮) is used regardless of quantity.** Boil with **plantain herb juice** (车前草汁) for one **division** (一分), then **parch and dry** (炒乾). Use **conch mother and *Anemarrhena* rhizome** (贝母、知母) in a **black pot** (黑锅), then scatter the powder of the two aforementioned **grasses** (二草末) inside the pot. When the smoke rises, place the **gunpowder** (炮) inside and **fan vigorously** (大抡) with three to fifty **winnowing baskets** (扇), until the juice achieves **true death** (真死). This can then be used to nurture **male and female stone bladders** (雌雄石胆) and refine **Geng sand** (庚砂).

**Male and Female (雌雄)** are prepared with **animal fat and *solanum nigrum* herb** (腆脂菜), boiled during the **three heat periods** (三伏时).

**Stone Bladder (石胆)** is prepared by boiling **unpalatable *brassica* grass** (鹅不食草) for one day, then mixing with **milk** (乳) to form powder. Roll with **honey** (蜜) into pills the size of a **yellow sprout** (黄子大), and place them in the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) to nurture by fire for three **7-day cycles** (三七日), until all the substances achieve **death** (死) within the crucible.

When combined with **gunpowder** (炮) to form the **embryo**, it is named the **Primordial Yang Crucible** (元阳匮), capable of nurturing **four Geng substances** (庚砂四药), each batch consisting of four *liang* for the crucible.

**Vermilion (朱砂)** is refined with **red croton** (川红寥), boiled for seventy days. Externally, wrap it tightly in **gold foil** (金箔), then place it inside the **pregnant crucible** (前匮) to nurture by fire for seven days. Take two *qian* of **vermilion**, which can transmute **one *liang* of worldly silver** (世银) into **gold of perfect hue** (足色金).

**Mother Sand of the Mandarin Duck and Dwarf Crucible (鸳鸯庚母砂法):**
In nurturing **Geng mother sand** (庚母砂), whether using **three 7-day cycles** (三七) or **four 6-day cycles** (四六), one must first extract the **true mercury** (真汞) from the sand and balance it with **silver mother** (银母), forming the sand.

Place it in the **empty crucible** (虚养) and nurture for one **7-day cycle** (一七日), then **press out the mercury** (逼出汞). Mix **greater celandine** (龙胆草), **wormwood** (莽草), **turmeric** (郁金), and **red pine resin** (赤松香) into powder, first spreading half over the pot’s base. Below, pour **Geng** and **mercury** (浇汞), then cover the remaining half over the head. Seal the pot’s mouth with **paper** (皮纸), gently warm with fire, and stir occasionally. After a day, take the sand and use it as a **foil** (贴身) in the crucible.

**Regulating the Dao of Geng: Transformation and Refinement**

Extract the **tooth** (牙子), nurture it in **empty crucible** (虚养) with minimal smoke—**ten percent** of the original method—then cook it as usual until it solidifies and matures.

Use a **silver chamber** (银室), place the **sprout** (芽) inside, and encase it with **dead lead** (死铅) as the outer crucible. Nurture with **fire for 49 days** (七七日), then remove the sprout.

For every **eight catties** of the sprout, add **two catties of true mercury** (真汞), blending them into a paste. Then use **twelve catties of Geng** (庚) as the **divine chamber** (神室), placing the sprout inside, and encase it with **sulfur** (硫黄) as the outer crucible. Nurture with **fire for 49 days** (七七日). Once the sprout is finely ground into a paste, add **two catties of true mercury** again.

Proceed to nurture it in a **golden chamber** (金室) with fire until it accumulates to **one catty**, naming it the **Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎大丹). This can then be used as a crucible to nurture the **Four Spirits of Cinnabar** (朱砂四神).

Take **four catties of the brightest cinnabar** (大光明者), first boiling it in **mulberry juice** (桑汁) for **three periods of dog days** (三伏时). Next, boil it with **vinegar and bile** (米醋胆炮) until the flame subsides. Wrap each piece in **gold foil** (金箔), then coat it with **bile** (胆炮) as a protective layer. Place it in the **Dragon-Tiger crucible** (龙虎匮), covering it, and nurture with fire for **21 days** (三七日). The cinnabar will then truly die and liquefy.

This can be transformed into the **Three Yellows** (三黄) to create the **Four Spirit Elixir** (四神丹). For each of the **Three Yellows** (二两), boil them in **mulberry juice** (桑汁) for **five periods of dog days** (五伏时). Add the **four catties of processed cinnabar**, blending them evenly into a paste.

Use **twelve catties of fresh Geng** (新庚) as the chamber, placing the **Four Spirits** (四神) inside, and encase it with the **Dragon-Tiger Elixir** (龙虎丹) as the outer crucible. Place the **golden chamber** (金室) within, sealing it tightly, and nurture with fire for **one month**. The fire dosage is **four catties**, with **one catty of fuel per day**, totaling **three catties of fuel per layer** (三斤一缎). Remove from the cold furnace—all Four Spirits will turn **purple**, and the fire is extinguished.

For every **one money** of **dry mercury** (乾汞), it can refine **one catty of high-grade purple-gold powder** (上色紫磨金). Nurtured with fire for **three months**, one money can refine **four catties of mercury**. After one cycle, one money can refine **forty catties of mercury**.

Alternatively, use the **Dragon-Tiger crucible** to refine **bile vitriol** (胆矾), extinguishing the fire, which can then **transmute worldly silver into superior gold**.

**Sulfur Transmuting Ling Sand into Gold (硫黄断灵砂成金)**

Take **dead sulfur** (灵草死硫黄), nurture it in gold for **seven days** (一七日) with **great fire in a crucible** (大火一鼎). Repeat this **49 times** (七七鼎), changing the gold each cycle—until the sulfur turns golden.

For every **one catty of Ling sand** (灵砂), use **two money of sulfur** (硫二钱) and a **small amount of red earth** (代赭石), blending them into a paste. Apply **saltpeter wash** (硝盥) to the top, then stir with **great fire in a single motion** (大火一抡). This yields **seven money of red gold** (赤金), a **treasure supreme**.

---
**Boxed Gold Method (盒金法)**

Take **five money of pure gold** (足色金子) and **five money of pure silver** (足色银子), melt them into a liquid, and shape them into **sheets or blocks**. Cut **clay tiles** (瓦片) to match the object’s length, width, and size.

First, lay a **thick layer of medicine** (药厚一分) at the base. Place the object on top, then cover it with another **thick layer of medicine** (一分多盖面). Seal it with a **clay tile** and build a **mud wall** around the edges. Place it in a furnace, lighting **several fires beneath** to level it. Arrange **red-hot coals** on top, covering the tile completely. Fan it until the tile turns **slightly red**, then cover it with **hot ashes**. After **seven to eight hours**, remove it, wash it with water, and apply the **peeling method** (剥法).

---
**Preparation of Flower Vitriol (花喊)**

Take **one catty of flower vitriol** (花臧) and **one catty of gas vitriol** (气胆矾). Rinse the flower vitriol with **half a bowl of water**, removing impurities, then slowly evaporate it in a **small wind furnace** (小风炉) using a **clay bowl** (瓦盏) until it crystallizes. Gradually add the vitriol, evaporating until dry. Grind it finely and apply the **peeling method** (剥法).

---
**Coating with Saltpeter, Vitriol, Niter, Stone Bile, Green Vitriol, and Yellow Vitriol**

Grind **salt, vitriol, niter, stone bile, green vitriol, and yellow vitriol** finely. Mix them with **vinegar in a clay vessel** into a thick paste. Use a **chicken feather** to brush it on, then bake it over fire, skimming it in water **three to four times**.

---
**Method of Coating Cinnabar (贴身朱砂法)**

Take **white honey** (白蜜), mixing it half with water. Simmer it in a **white vessel** (白器) over fire until it thickens. Drip a few drops of honey into the vessel, then add **cinnabar** (朱砂), stirring until the cinnabar is **completely coated**.

Pour the cinnabar into another **white vessel**, gently wiping it with **soft paper** until the cinnabar is **slightly moistened with honey**. Place a **sheet of prepared paper** (熟纸) on top, then use a **sharp tendon** to carefully transfer each grain of cinnabar onto the paper, arranging them evenly. Apply the **coating medicine** (贴身药) on top.

Cover it again with **prepared paper**, then place **coating herbs** (贴身草药) on top. Gently shake the coating medicine until evenly distributed, dry it, wrap it in paper, and let it cool. Place it in a **mother crucible** (合母) with **five parts below and three parts above**.

Follow the **fire regimen of the Green Gold Method** (青金法), using **Sichuan pepper and tangerine leaves** (淮椒橘叶) to boil the cinnabar.

---
**Green Gold Method (青金法)**

Take **five money of mother substance** (母) and **two money of mercury** (汞), placing them in a **sweet crucible** (甘锅), covering it with **oil**, and gently heating until the **mother solidifies and transforms**.

Take **one to two money** of the mother substance, then remove and scrape off the mercury sand, leaving **three and a half money** of pure mother substance. Pass the mercury sand through fine paper, then take **half a liang** of already-boiled mercury inside, ensuring only **half a money** of mother substance remains, leaving the rest aside.

With **four and a half money** of mother substance, this mother may later be used incrementally to boil **twenty-plus liang** of mercury, each time measuring **two and a half liang** as standard.

Next, take the **half-liang of mercury-cinnabar** and place it in a **gourd-shaped crucible** with **one and a half money** of [another substance?], roasting it into **Green Gold**. Then add **half a money each of gold sprouts (金苗)**, **female lead (雌妇)**, and **grass-encased cinnabar (草伏朱砂)**, roasting until they intermingle and fuse. After lactating again, roast briefly, then shape it into a **four-money circle** using a bamboo mold.

Moisten the medicine with **rice-wine broth**, place it inside the circle with **parchment below** and **lactated paste above**, pressing tightly and drying. Then take **one and a half liang of good mountain saltpeter (山泽)**, grinding it into a fine, continuous powder. Spread **two parts** on the paper and cover with **three parts**, sealing it to a height of **four fen**. Apply the fire regimen:

- **Days 1–3, 2–3 money** of fire.
- **Days 4–6, 2–4 money** of fire.
- **Days 7–9, 2–5 money** of fire.
- **Days 10–12, 2–6 money** of fire.
- **Days 13–14, 2–7 money** of fire.

Once complete, remove it and **chisel a grain-sized piece of Green Gold** from the mother. Blow it over fire—if it forms a bead without flame, it has separated from the mother. Place the Green Gold in a **mother crucible** for **ten days of empty cultivation (虚养)**, then blow-test again until no flame appears.

If flame remains, repeat the empty cultivation. Then take the **seven-money already-dead elixir (死丹)**, boil fresh mother-mercury as before, roast **one and a half liang** following the prior method, and mix with the dead elixir. After lactating again, roast briefly, then divide into **two cakes**, placing them in **two mother crucibles** with **seven liang of mountain saltpeter each**. Apply fire from **two and four money**, up to **two liang**, for **fourteen days**. Upon removal, blow-test—if it forms **white silver cinnabar (白银朱)**, proceed.

Take the **two-liang already-dead Green Gold**, roast **eight liang of fresh mother-mercury**, and divide into **five cakes** for **five crucibles**. Each crucible uses **six liang of mountain saltpeter**, with fire from **two and six money**, up to **two and two money**, for **fourteen days**. After removal, empty-cultivate for **half a month**, then the medicine may be tested.

**Method for Preparing the Mother Crucible (制母方灶) and Boiling Mother-Mercury (元煮母汞):**
Take dried mother substance, wrap it in paper, and place it in a **fifty-liang sweet crucible**, sealing the top with paper. Heat to drive out the mercury. Then wrap the mother in **two or three layers of paper**, encase it in a **yellow clay ball three to four fen thick**, and slow-roast overnight. The next day, remove the clay, place it in a **wind furnace**, and collect the smoke-laden crucible.

**Refining Cinnabar with Regal Mealy Plant (支笔涯朱砂转庚梅核):**
Take **eight liang of cinnabar**, **three large担 of sour-sop (三角酸)**, and extract **two dou of natural juice**, along with **three jin of black plums (乌梅)**, boiling into **one dou of liquid**. Suspend and boil the cinnabar for **three periods (三伏)**, then drain and dry it. Apply **stone brain oil or pounded sand water**, and coat with **ten parts of magnetite powder (十分坚者)** as a binding agent.

Then take **six liang of pure gold (赤金)** and **ten liang of mercury**, boiling with concentrated **pepper juice** until it forms sand. Cook with **goji sprout juice (枸杞苗汁)** for a day, then reboil the sand, grinding until moist. For every **one liang of cinnabar**, wrap it with **two liang of mother sand**, sealing tightly overnight to solidify.

Take **eight liang of realgar (代赭石)**, grind finely, and soak in **seven to eight parts acetic acid**. Boil in a **porcelain vessel**, stirring evenly, with **four liang of firefly (火蝴蝶, iron flower)** and **two liang of genuine copper sulfate (胆矾)**. Suspend and boil, adding heat gradually, for **half a day in acetic acid**. Discard the firefly, retaining only the **realgar-copper sulfate mixture**, then dry it.

Take **one gourd (山莆)**, the **cultivation-fire crucible (养火合子)**, and treat it with **ginger juice**. Then use **chicken egg white to mix ink**, coating the gourd **ten-plus layers**, about the thickness of a grain of rice. Apply **five flavors of male and female bile (雄胆曾代)**, mixed with chicken egg white and ink, coating another **ten-plus layers**. Place the **previously refined stone and copper sulfate** inside the gourd as a container, then arrange the **mother-sand-wrapped cinnabar** like planting lotus seeds, sealing it properly. Bury it in an **ash pit** for **one month of cultivation**, with fire from **one to fifteen**, then back to one—**a full cycle of 140 liang of fire**. Cultivate using the **Unfinished (未济) Method**.

When complete, remove the cinnabar, strip away the mother sand, and reveal the treasure.

**Second Transformation: Yellow Sprout (二转黄芽)**
Take the previously refined cinnabar, bathe it in **concentrated juice of gold-star grass (金星草, 管仲苗)** for one hour. Then prepare the gourd, coating it with **ginger juice, chicken egg white, and five flavors of male bile in vinegar**, as before. Place the cinnabar inside using the **pouring method (浇淋法)**. Pour **four liang of true mercury**, cultivating at **child-midday-ox-monkey hours (子午卯酉)**, maintaining **four liang of fire**. Again use the **Unfinished Method**. Open after **three days**—do not disturb, as the sprout is tender. Pour **three more liang** on **days five or seven**, repeating until **twelve liang** are poured. Open and close to harvest the sprout, storing it in a **pure chamber**.

**Third Transformation: Purple River Vehicle (三转紫河车)**
Take **five liang of clear male essence (明雄)**, undisturbed, and boil with **concentrated soapberry (皂角)** for **three periods (三伏)**, washing and drying it. Coat with **chicken egg white and male bile**, then roast with **stone brain oil** until permeated. Alternatively, add **pounded sand**. Wrap tightly in **gold foil**, then coat with **chicken egg white and ink ten-plus layers**. Place the prior sprout inside, adding **two liang of true mercury**, grinding into powder.

「Take the **outer layer of the mother sand** (母砂), adding **five liang of raw cinnabar** (赤金), and process the rest as before to form a **refined elixir** (灶成汁). Mold it into a **divine chamber** (神室)—shaped like a chicken egg—following the **sand-vehicle preparation method** (制砂莆法).

Then insert the **sprout** (芽子), half beneath, and place the **male essence** (雄) within. Cover with the remaining half of the sprout above. Secure it with **iron wire** as per the method, then seal firmly with mud (用泥封固毕). Apply **amberglass medicine** (瑁璃药) to coat it.

Next, take **four liang of red salt** (赤盐) and **two liang of saltpeter** (硝), grind finely, and gradually add them to a **large sweet crucible** (大甘锅). Process into elixir (灶成汁) and pour into **porcelain or stone vessels** (磁器、石器). Grind again into fine powder, mix with the **sand-vehicle** (沙莆), and place inside the **golden chamber** (金室), sealing it firmly. Then immerse in **ash pit** (灰池) and nurture it with **unfinished fire** (未济火).

For **one day, one liang of fire** (火候), until **six days, six liang**. On the **seventh day**, nurture it with **six liang of yang fire** (六阳火). **Forty-nine days** suffice. Retrieve the **vehicle** (莆), suspend it in **lead**, and decoct for half a day. Then open the **vehicle** to extract the medicine, grinding it finely together.

Divide each **liang into four hundred pills** (丸), using **paper pulp juice and wax** (楮汁蜡剂) to form them. For each pill, take **one plum kernel** (梅核), and pierce a small hole at the top. Remove the pit (去仁), then insert **eight or nine parts of true mercury** (真汞), along with **one pill of medicine** inside. Seal the hole with **willow wood** (柳木).

Next, use **gold-wrapped earth** (包金土), **red earth** (代赭), **stone bile** (石胆), **alum** (矾), **saltpeter** (伏硝), and **white friend’s resin** (白友津) to adjust and coat paper, wrapping the plum kernel **four or five layers** thick. Seal firmly with salt mud (盐泥固了), then place in a **sweet crucible** (甘锅), packing it solid with yellow mud (黄泥筑实). Heat with a **great fire** (大火) until it glows red and the mercury within turns to gold (刺水中汞成金矣).

**Method for Refining the Mud (法泥):**
Take **half a jin of earthworm soil** (蚯蚓土), **four liang of red stone pitch** (赤石脂), and **two liang of yellow cinnabar** (黄丹). Use **two liang of rabbit hair powder** (兔毫盏末), grinding them finely together. Mix with **white friend’s resin juice** (白友汁) and pound **a million times** (杵千万下) before combining with the inner and outer chambers.

**Amberglass Medicine (瑁璃药):**
Take **half a jin of lead yellow flower** (铅黄花), adding **two liang of saltpeter** (硝) and **two liang of borax** (硼). Process vigorously into elixir (大抡作汁), applying it to the **divine chamber** (神室) to ensure a sealed, airtight closure (使其封固得密). If nurturing and refining the **vehicle** (糁), it must be done this way, so that the **qi does not escape** (气不出外), and the **transmutation of the exterior will be complete** (裹面造化自全矣).

The **Great Elixir of Golden Flower and Jade Dew** (金华玉液大丹) is finished.
