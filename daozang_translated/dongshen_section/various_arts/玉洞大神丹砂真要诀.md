**The True Essential Formula of the Great Divine Cinnabar of the Jade Grotto**
Composed by Zhang Guo of Gusheshan

**Chapter One: The Formula for Discerning Cinnabar**

Cinnabar is the lord of the ten thousand spirits and the root of creation and transformation. It dwells in the southern quarter. Some call it the "Crimson Dragon" by title, while others name it the "Vermilion Crow." The highest grade is born in stone caves of Chen and Jinzhou, appearing in several hues. The middle grade comes from Jiao and Guizhou, also manifesting in various kinds. The lowest grade emerges from Heng and Shaozhou, likewise found in multiple forms. All differ in purity and turbidity, truth and falsehood.

That which receives the upright *qi* confers communion with the mysterious and wondrous when ingested. That which bears partial *qi* still grants longevity upon consumption.

The finest, luminous cinnabar, emerges from the mountains and stones of Chen and Jinzhou, upon white stalagmite beds. Twelve grains form a cluster, their color resembling an unopened red lotus, radiant as the sun. Some clusters consist of nine grains. Those of twelve or nine grains are most potent; those of seven or five are of secondary efficacy.

Within each cluster, there stands one large grain, weighing over ten taels, serving as the sovereign. Surrounding it are smaller grains, each weighing eight or nine taels, while others of six or seven taels or less act as ministers, encircling and paying homage to the central sovereign. Around the cluster, one or two *dou* of miscellaneous cinnabar may cling, with vermilion cinnabar concealed within. When selecting lotus-bud-shaped grains, place them on red silk at night—those whose luminosity shines through are also of the highest grade. There is also a type resembling horse teeth, or those with a white, floating radiance, known as *ma-ya* cinnabar of the finest quality. If it bears a mica-like white sheen, it is *ma-ya* cinnabar of the middle grade. Next, there are round or elongated grains resembling laughing faces, their hue a deep red-purple—these are the superior *zi-ling* cinnabar. Conversely, those with angular, stone-like edges and a bluish sheen are the inferior *zi-ling* cinnabar, akin to that from Jiao and Guizhou. Any cluster-born cinnabar, or that extracted from stone, resembling a lotus bud in form and possessing a luminous surface, is also of the highest grade. If the grains number three to five, weighing one tael and translucent, they are of the middle grade. Fragmented pieces, if clear and bright, are of the lowest grade. As for that from Heng and Shaozhou, all are purple cinnabar extracted from stone, their red glow marking them as inferior. *Ying* cinnabar, if granular and translucent, when refined and ingested, merely cures worldly ailments. *Tu* cinnabar, born in earthen caves, and *tan* cinnabar, emerging from riverbed sands, are mixed with soil and stone, thus unfit for the highest-grade elixirs. For refining and consumption, the finest is cluster-born. One sovereign grain from the center of a cluster, when refined and ingested, may enable one to ascend as an immortal of the highest order. As for merchant cinnabar and that not originating in the southern regions, even if luminous, it is not recorded in the primordial texts on cinnabar.

**Second Grade: The Yin-Yang Refinement and Fire Phases of Cinnabar**

The *Ben Jing* states: Yang essence is fire; yin essence is water. Cinnabar is yang essence, yet requires yin to restrain it—water stone, salt, and *ma-ya* nitre serve this purpose. For one *jin* of luminous cinnabar from Chen and Jinzhou, use six *liang* of stone salt and six *liang* of *ma-ya* nitre. For secondary luminous cinnabar, use four *liang* each of stone salt and *ma-ya* nitre per *jin*. For white *ma-ya* cinnabar, use three *liang* each. For *zi-ling* cinnabar, use two *liang* each. For impure, riverbed cinnabar of lesser potency, stone salt alone may suffice. The stone salt and *ma-ya* nitre must be fired until glowing red before use. For large grains of luminous cinnabar, crush them to the size of adzuki beans, place them in an earthen cauldron, and mix with *ma-ya* nitre and water. Boil with a martial fire day and night for one hundred days without extinguishing the flame. Once complete, wash the cinnabar and place it in a crucible for yin-yang fire refinement. The crucible should hold one *sheng*. There are five types: gold, silver, copper, iron, and earth (the latter being porcelain). Place the cinnabar in the crucible and refine it with fire phases—five days make one phase, three phases one *qi*, and eight *qi* (twenty-four phases, one hundred twenty days) complete the refinement. Each five-day phase consists of four days under the *kan* trigram (water boiling) and one day under the *li* trigram (yang fire refinement). On the first day of yang fire, use seven *liang* of charcoal, maintaining a steady fire of seven *liang* beneath the crucible without fluctuation. With each cycle, add one *liang* of charcoal. If mercury or frost-like vapor appears with black *qi*, mix the cinnabar in a mortar and gently grind with a jade pestle until the mercury is fully absorbed. Return it to the crucible and continue the fire refinement. After twelve cycles, add two *liang* of charcoal per cycle and one *fen* of stone salt. If two to three *liang* or more of mercury frost ascends, its ethereal glow will gradually turn the elixir purple-red. By the twentieth cycle, add three *liang* of charcoal; if half a *liang* or less of mercury frost appears on the crucible lid, it will be hard as gold flakes, golden-white and luminous. After twenty-four cycles, the cinnabar is fully refined, its color a brilliant red, radiant to behold. Refine the cinnabar further with salt flowers, wrap it in yellow clay, seal tightly, and place it in a yang furnace. Apply a martial fire for thirty days. The lighter portion may be drawn out and ingested—one *liang* yields three hundred sixty grains, to be formed into pills with jujube pulp, though the fire toxin must first be expelled. The heavier portion may be smelted into golden liquid, becoming a treasure.

**Third Grade: Refining Cinnabar with Fire to Reveal Treasure**

For each *liang* of refined cinnabar, use half a *liang* of salt flowers. Place the salt at the bottom of a pot, then add the cinnabar. Once the pot and elixir glow red, pound them a thousand times—the golden liquid that flows forth is called white gold, its surface lustrous and golden, its brilliance beyond description.

**Fourth Grade: Transforming Treasure and Generating Cinnabar**

Take the white silver from cinnabar and fashion it into a four-*liang* crucible, placing it in a glazed porcelain bottle with a one-*sheng* capacity. The crucible should fit snugly at the bottle’s base. First, prepare the silver crucible with the following ingredients:
One *liang* of Beiting cinnabar
One *liang* of stone salt
One *fen* of *qi-lin-jie*

Combine the three ingredients, grind them together, and mix with bitter wine to coat all sides of the crucible until the medicine is fully applied and dry. Then wrap it with yellow clay mud to a thickness of two *cun*. Place it in a husk fire and burn for three times seven days. Afterward, use a charcoal martial fire to burn for three days. Remove the outer mud, take the precious crucible, and place it in the aforementioned bottle. Add four *liang* of mercury—this mercury must be derived from the original cinnabar. Once the mercury is placed in the crucible, add five *ge* of water, neither increasing nor decreasing the amount. Constantly replenish the water in the bottle to maintain five *ge*. Nurture with a civil fire for two times seven days until it boils like fish eyes. When the time is complete, add another four *liang* of raw mercury and nurture with fire for another two times seven days as before, allowing it to dry. Seal the mouth tightly and apply a martial fire to force it for three days, whereupon red and yellow cinnabar will surge forth above the precious crucible. Collect this frost-like cinnabar, and as before, replenish the mercury to maintain a constant eight *liang* in the bottle, neither increasing nor decreasing. Nurture and force with civil and martial fires to produce the frost-like cinnabar, then collect it. For every four *liang* of treasure, calculate to gather one *jin* of cinnabar. Then take this cinnabar and, following the previous method, add medicine and boil for thirty days. Place it in the tripod and refine with yin and yang fire phases, repeating the twenty-four phases over one hundred twenty days, after which the cinnabar will be subdued once more. If you wish to melt and pound it, follow the previous method using *ling-hua* as the agent to guide the golden liquid to flow forth, yielding thirteen *liang* of yellow-flowered silver, its color gradually turning a luminous yellow. If you wish to ingest it, do not sever the *cui*, but merely remove one *liang* of toxin. It can be formed into three hundred sixty pills with jujube pulp.

**Fifth Grade: The Formula for Transforming Golden Cinnabar**

Take four *liang* of yellow-flowered silver and fashion it into a crucible, matching the size of the bottle’s base as before. Use the following ingredients:
One *fen* of Pu Prefecture chalcanthite
One *liang* of stone salt
One *liang* of roasted cinnabar

Combine these ingredients, grind them with bitter wine, and coat all sides of the crucible until the medicine is fully applied. Then wrap it with yellow clay mud and burn it in a husk fire for two times seven days. Afterward, use a charcoal martial fire to burn for one times seven days. Remove the mud, take out the crucible, and place it in a glazed porcelain bottle as before. Add four *liang* of mercury derived from its native cinnabar and five *ge* of clear water. Nurture with a civil fire for two times seven days. Then add another four *liang* of raw mercury and nurture with a civil fire for another two times seven days. Once dry, seal the mouth tightly and apply a martial fire to force it for one day, causing the cinnabar to surge forth upon the precious gold, displaying a red and yellow hue. Collect the cinnabar and replenish the mercury. When one *jin* of cinnabar is gathered, the quantity is sufficient. Further refine the collected cinnabar in the tripod, following the previous method of flying and subduing with fire phases, with five days constituting one cycle. For the first three days, use the *kan* trigram, boiling with water. For the next three days, use the *li* trigram, flying with yang fire. Begin the yang fire with seven *liang* of charcoal. For each subsequent cycle, increase the charcoal by three *liang*. If mercury frost appears, its color will be yellow-purple, resembling arrowheads, weighing one to two *liang*. Collect this frost, combine it with cinnabar in a mortar, and grind it with a jade pestle until fully incorporated. Return it to the tripod and refine with fire phases as before. After twenty phases, one hundred days in total, the cinnabar will be subdued by fire. If you wish to melt and pound it, follow the previous method, using salt flowers to guide the pounding, allowing the precious liquid to flow forth and form azure gold. If ingesting it, merely remove the toxin without severing the *cui*.

**Sixth Grade: The Formula for Transforming Azure Gold**

Take four *liang* of azure gold and fashion it into a crucible. Use the following ingredients:
Half a *liang* of red salt
Half a *liang* of *da-peng* cinnabar

Grind them together and mix with bitter wine to coat all sides of the crucible. Gradually apply the medicine with fire until fully used, then wrap it with yellow clay mud. Burn it in a husk fire for two times seven days, followed by a charcoal martial fire for one times seven days. Remove the mud, take out the crucible, and place it in the bottle as before. Add four *liang* of mercury and five *ge* of water, neither increasing nor decreasing the amount. Nurture for two times seven days, then add another four *liang* of mercury and nurture for another two times seven days. Once dry, seal the mouth tightly and apply a martial fire to force it for one day, causing the cinnabar to surge forth. Collect the cinnabar, replenish the mercury as before, and nurture with civil and martial fires to produce cinnabar, collecting it until one *jin* is gathered, at which point the quantity is sufficient. Then place the collected cinnabar in the tripod and refine it with the previous method of flying and subduing, with five days constituting one cycle. For the first two days, use the *kan* trigram, boiling with water for two days. For the next three days, use the *li* trigram, flying with fire for three days. Follow the previous fire phases, increasing the charcoal quantity. After sixteen phases, eighty days in total, the golden cinnabar will be subdued by fire. If you wish to pound it, use salt flowers as the agent to guide the pounding, allowing the golden liquid to flow forth and form yellow gold. If ingesting it, do not sever the *cui*, merely remove the toxin, and you may endure in the world forever.

**Seventh Grade: The Formula for Transforming Purple-Gold Cinnabar**

Take eight *liang* of yellow gold and fashion it into a round tripod with a capacity of four *ge*. Use another two *liang* of gold to make a tripod lid. Inside the tripod, use the following ingredients:
One *liang* of sulfur
One *liang* of red salt
One *liang* of Beiting cinnabar
Half a *liang* of *da-peng* cinnabar

Combine the four ingredients, grind them together, and mix with bitter wine to coat the inside of the tripod and the underside of the lid evenly until the medicine is fully applied. Once dry, wrap it with yellow clay mud to a thickness of approximately one *cun*. Nurture it with a civil fire on all sides for three times seven days, maintaining a constant warmth to the touch. After three times seven days, apply a martial fire for one times seven days, keeping the fire burning day and night without interruption. When the time is complete, allow it to cool, remove the mud, and reapply sweet clay mud to the bottom of the tripod to a thickness of about three *fen*. Suspend it in the furnace, ensuring the area beneath the tripod allows for even fire distribution.

Add four *liang* of true mercury into the golden tripod, with two *ge* of water. Seal it with the lid and nurture it for seven days, maintaining a constant fire of five *liang* of mature coals beneath—neither increasing nor decreasing. Continuously replenish water in the tripod to keep it at approximately two *ge*, ensuring it never dries. After seven days, add another four *liang* of mercury and nurture it with a civil fire for another seven days as before. Once dry, seal the opening tightly and apply a martial fire gradually for one day, whereupon red-luminous cinnabar will form—collect five *liang* of this red-luminous cinnabar. Then add five *liang* of raw mercury, ensuring the tripod always contains eight *liang* of mercury. Nurture it with a civil fire for seven days as before, then seal the opening. Apply a martial fire for one day, and the cinnabar will surge forth—collect it. By adding mercury and extracting cinnabar, a total of thirty *liang* is obtained. Once the quantity is sufficient, follow the method from the previous section: place it in the tripod, and regulate the fire for refinement and sublimation, with five days as one cycle. On the first day, boil it with *Kan*-trigram water; on the second day, use *Li*-trigram fire to refine it with yang fire. For four days, begin with seven *liang* of charcoal, increasing by two *liang* after each cycle. After seven cycles, increase by three *liang* per cycle, whereupon five-colored golden-luminous frost will fly out in two or three *liang*. Collect the frost in a bowl, mix it with the cinnabar, and grind them together with a jade pestle until fully incorporated. Refine and sublimate it in the tripod for fourteen cycles, totaling seventy days, until the cinnabar is fully subdued, its red brilliance unfathomable. If you strike it, use *guan*-flower to guide it, causing the golden liquid to flow down and form red gold. When ingesting, merely expel the toxins—do not sever the *cui*.

**Method for Transforming Red Gold (Eighth Grade)**
Take nine *liang* of red gold and cast it into a tripod with a capacity of approximately five *ge*. Use two *liang* to make a lid. Coat the inside of the tripod with medicine as described in the previous section, using the following ingredients:
- Sulfur
- *Bei-ting* cinnabar
- Red *guan*
- *Da-peng* cinnabar

Increase each ingredient by one part compared to the previous method, grind them thoroughly, and mix with bitter wine. Coat the inside of the tripod evenly until the medicine is fully applied. Once dry, seal it with the lid and wrap it with yellow clay mud to a thickness of approximately one *cun*. Follow the previous method of civil and martial fires, nurturing it for three times seven days, then firing it with a martial fire for one times seven days until the mud ball turns as red as the fire. Once cooled, remove the mud and reapply sweet clay mud to the bottom of the tripod to a thickness of about three *fen*. Place it in the furnace, add six *liang* of true mercury into the tripod with three *ge* of water, and continuously replenish to prevent drying. Seal the opening and apply a martial fire for two days, whereupon red cinnabar will form—collect it. Add eight *liang* of mercury, nurture it with a civil fire for seven days, then apply a martial fire for two days, transforming it into red cinnabar. Collect the cinnabar and add seven *liang* of mercury. Nurture it with a civil fire for seven days, then apply a martial fire for two days to transform it into red cinnabar. Collect the cinnabar, add five *liang* of mercury, nurture it with a civil fire for seven days, then apply a martial fire for two days. Collect the cinnabar again, add three *liang* of mercury, and follow the previous method of civil and martial fires. In total, collect thirty-two *liang* of divine cinnabar before stopping. Mix the cinnabar with three *liang* of sulfur, grind them thoroughly until fully incorporated, then place it in the golden tripod and refine it with yang fire. Use five days as one cycle, increasing the charcoal by two *liang* after each cycle. After seven cycles, increase the charcoal by three *liang* per cycle. Observe each cycle carefully—when crimson-golden frost flies out, collect it in a bowl, mix it with the cinnabar, add one *ge* of bitter wine, and grind them together with a jade pestle until fully incorporated. Place it back in the tripod and refine it with fire for fourteen cycles, totaling seventy days, until the cinnabar is subdued and its color becomes purple-luminous. When smelted, it forms purple gold. Use salt-flower to guide it. When ingesting, do not sever the *cui*—merely expel the fire toxins, and longevity may be attained.

**Method for Transforming Purple Gold (Ninth Grade)**
Take one *jin* of purple gold and cast it into a tripod with a capacity of approximately seven *ge*. Use five *liang* to make a lid. Coat the inside of the tripod with medicine as described in the previous section, using the following ingredients:
- Four *liang* of sulfur
- Two *liang* of red salt
- One *liang* of *Bei-ting* cinnabar
- One *liang* of *Da-peng* cinnabar

Mix them with bitter wine and grind until thoroughly blended, then coat the inside of the tripod until the medicine is fully applied. Once dry, seal it with the lid and wrap it with yellow clay mud to a thickness of approximately one *cun*. Nurture it with a civil fire for three times seven days, then apply a martial fire for one times seven days as before. Once cooled, remove the mud and reapply sweet clay mud around the outside of the tripod to a thickness of two and a half *fen*. Suspend it in the furnace, add twelve *liang* of true mercury into the tripod with three *ge* of water—neither increasing nor decreasing—and ensure it never dries by continuously replenishing. Seal it with the lid and nurture it with a civil fire for seven days, maintaining a constant warmth to the touch on the tripod. Once the time is complete, allow it to dry, seal the opening tightly, and gradually apply a martial fire for three days. Open the tripod to inspect the mercury—it will have transformed into crimson frost. Do not collect it; instead, add nine *liang* of mercury and follow the previous method of civil and martial fires. Once the time is complete, open it—it will have transformed into crimson frost. Add six *liang* of mercury and repeat the process of civil and martial fires. Once the time is complete, open it—it will have transformed into crimson frost. Add five *liang* of mercury, nurture it with a civil fire for seven days, then apply a martial fire for one day, yielding thirty-three *liang* of red-purple five-colored crimson frost cinnabar. Place it in a bowl, add four *liang* of sulfur, and grind it with a jade pestle for one day. Then return the cinnabar to the tripod and seal the opening. Refine it with pure yang fire for seven days as one cycle. Open it, mix it with half a *ge* of bitter wine, grind it thoroughly, and place it back in the tripod to refine and sublimate for seven days as one cycle.

At the initial firing, use thirteen *liang* of charcoal. For each subsequent cycle, increase the charcoal by one *liang*, and after five cycles, increase it by two *liang* per cycle. When the cinnabar emerges in vibrant five colors, collect it. Grind it in a bowl with one *ge* of bitter wine, then return it to the tripod for sublimation. Each cycle requires inspection, after which it should be mixed with bitter wine and ground again before being placed back in the tripod for sublimation. After twelve cycles and eighty-four days, the cinnabar will be fully subdued by fire, its radiance and splendor dazzling, its iridescent glow indescribable. To refine it further, use *shenghua yin* to liquefy it, yielding *zimo heche* gold. If consumed, first remove its toxins and retain the green essence: one *liang* is formed into three hundred and sixty pills with jujube pulp. Ingesting it grants levitation. One pill of *heche* cinnabar can transmute a *jin* of mercury, lead, tin, copper, or iron into gold.

**Tenth Method: Extracting Mercury**
First, take an iron tripod and seal it tightly top and bottom. Open a small hole in the furnace to allow the qi to escape. Burn it with firewood for three days to collect the mercury. If any remains, repeat the sublimation—this is the optimal method.

**Eleventh Method: Refining Mercury**
Take one *jin* of mercury and three *liang* of sulfur. First, grind the sulfur into powder, place it in a bowl, and heat it gently. Gradually add the mercury while grinding vigorously to form green sand. Then transfer it to a porcelain jar with a one-*sheng* capacity, seal the exterior with yellow clay to a thickness of two *fen*, and cover it tightly. Place it in the furnace, surround it with one *jin* of charcoal, and nurture it for three days, maintaining a steady fire. After three days, apply a martial fire, using ten *jin* of charcoal divided into two batches of five *jin* each to heat the jar. If a green flame appears, seal it with thin mud to prevent the flame from escaping. When the fire is exhausted, open it—the mercury will have transformed into purple sand.

Take one *jin* of black lead and melt it in the tripod. Then add finely ground purple sand to the molten lead, remove it from the fire, and stir vigorously to blend them into sand. Place it back in the tripod, cover it with a two-*fen* layer of fine salt, press it firmly, and seal the opening. Apply a martial fire for half a day, and the numinous mercury will emerge. Follow the seven-step reversal process: when adding mercury in the second cycle, extract it twice with lead, then return it to the mercury to enhance the golden cinnabar. In the third cycle, the mercury is refined and extracted three times. In the fourth cycle, the mercury is extracted four times from the cinnabar. In the fifth cycle, the mercury is refined and extracted five times. In the sixth cycle, the mercury is treated as before, combined with sulfur, and refined into purple sand. In the seventh cycle, use one *jin* of black lead, repeating the firing and extraction process as previously described. Through these transformations of water and fire’s essence, aligned with the seven-step reversal, the great Dao’s alchemical transmutations are naturally achieved.

**Twelfth Method: Discerning Various Mineral Medicines**
**Discerning Rock Salt:**
Rock salt forms from the condensation of extreme yin qi, its texture angular like flaked stone, its luster white like granular salt. Its taste is slightly blander than common salt. It can subdue and restrain yang essence, neutralizing the toxic potency of fire. When combined with alum or sulfur, its refined properties enhance the brilliance of metallic essence, dispelling stagnant qi. It serves as an auxiliary in the seven-step process.

**Discerning Horse-Teeth Niter:**
Horse-teeth niter, also a product of yin essence, resembles frozen water stone. Found in Shu’s rivers, its function is similar to rock salt in subduing yang essence and dissolving the qi of fiery stones. Its independent restraining power differs slightly from rock salt.

**Discerning Northern Pavilion Sand:**
Northern Pavilion sand, endowed with the qi of yin stones and the essence of yang toxins, can dissolve the metals of the five stones. Its potency rivals sulfur, dispelling impurities and augmenting yang, making its effects profound. The finest quality appears in granular form, with a pale red hue and translucent brilliance. It serves as an auxiliary in the seven-reversal and two-step processes. When combined with *dapeng* sand, red salt, and sulfur for refinement, its efficacy surpasses natural transformation.

**Discerning Qilin Lizard:**
This medicine originates from the Western Hu regions, governed by the Fire Star, formed from yang stone and congealed by yin. Its color resembles purple ore, its shape like decayed stone. Its effects parallel mercury, harmonizing and enhancing yang essence while dispelling yin stagnation, yielding profound benefits. When burned in fire, authentic specimens exude a red liquid that flows freely, and their ash retains the original color over time.

**Discerning Chalcanthite:**
This medicine is found in Song Yue and the Zhongtiao Mountains of Pu Prefecture, endowed with the numinous qi of extraordinary stones. Its form resembles *sese* (a mineral), its nature fluid and responsive. It interacts with the eight stones and transmutes the essence of the five metals, serving the central palace. To test it, apply it to iron or copper and heat it—the metal will turn red, demonstrating its subduing and transformative powers. Alternatively, place a small amount in water within a copper vessel; if the water does not turn blue-green over several days, it is genuine.

**Discerning Dapeng Sand:**
This medicine is endowed with yang essence but nurtured by yin qi. Its form resembles amber, its texture like peach resin, and its nature is harmonious. When combined with sulfur and red salt for refinement, its effects are profound.

**Thirteenth Method: Transforming and Subduing the Four Yellows**
Male and female sulfur both belong to the central palace, the domain of earth (wu and ji). Their nature contains the toxicity of yang fire. They readily transmute the essence of the five metals yet do not alter their inherent luster.

Where the substance flows with liquid essence, its power can transmute the quintessence of the five stones into copper, and further refine it into gold. When subdued by fire, if its color turns white like light powder and its fluids flow freely, it transforms the five metals into silver.

Moreover, the powers of the Four Yellows each derive from their inherent qi, enabling the transmutation of the five metals. Orpiment (male yellow) transforms iron; realgar (female yellow) transforms tin; pyrite (coupled yellow) transforms copper into silver or gold through successive refinements. Yet sulfur possesses the highest potency—it augments yang, enriches essence, and returns turbidity to clarity, making it the commander of the seventy-two stones.

When the Four Yellows encounter cinnabar, Dapeng sand, or chalcanthite, their nature submits and returns to their original state, their color unchanged. If they encounter halite, mirabilite, saltpeter, or chalcanthite and are subjected to fire, they revert to a white hue.

Thus, in the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the methods for subduing the seventy-two stones all require the union of the embryonic matrix. If mixed with equal parts of earth-green, lead powder, and sal ammoniac to form a crucible for refinement, the earth-green shares the same class as the Four Yellows, capable of neutralizing fire toxicity and effecting transformation.

**Fourteenth Method: The Purple Gold Elixir of True Transmutation**
Take ten catties of true mercury and thirty-five taels of seven-times-refined cinnabar purple gold. Combine the two substances in a separate crucible and melt them into a liquid. Then, blend them evenly, remove from the fire, and swiftly stir until they form fine grains. Add five taels of sulfur, and grind the three substances together in a mortar for a full day. Subsequently, transfer them to a cauldron and apply fire in six cycles, each cycle augmenting the yang furnace and cauldron’s fire regimen. After a full day, the great elixir will be complete. When forged, it becomes purple gold; when left to cool and ground, it becomes the great elixir.

**The Cauldron and Fire Regimen**
The cauldron for the great elixir must be crafted in accordance with the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity) and the Five Spirits. The cauldron should be made from twenty-four taels of seven-times-refined gold, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. Sixteen taels are cast into a round cauldron with a capacity of nine *ge*, aligning with the number of the nine yang extremes. The lid weighs eight taels, corresponding to the eight solar terms. (Is the cauldron lid also twenty-four taels? Sixteen taels form the cauldron, matching the weight of one catty, to complete the grand measure.)

Afterward, place the prepared purple gold sand into the cauldron, seal it tightly to prevent the leakage of yang qi. For the furnace method: during the *jia-chen* decade, on the *wu-shen* day, in the southwest, take pure earth and layer it into an altar two feet four inches high, divided into three tiers with interconnected qi passages beneath.

The upper tier, nine inches high, serves as the Celestial Gate, with nine apertures symbolizing the nine stars. The middle tier, one foot high, serves as the Human Gate, with twelve doors symbolizing the twelve earthly branches, each door equipped with a panel. The lower tier, five inches high, serves as the Earthly Gate, with eight openings symbolizing the eight winds. The furnace’s interior must measure one foot three inches in diameter. Place the cauldron within the furnace, suspended two inches above the base. A supporting earthen platform, two inches high and matching the cauldron’s size, is placed beneath it.

Then, regulate the fire according to the regimen of the twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal divisions. Five days constitute one *hou*, three *hou* make one qi, and two qi form one month. During the day, before noon, use eight taels of mature fire; from midnight to noon, use sixteen taels of fire. Increase the fire during yin hours and decrease it during yang hours. When the fire cycles are complete, the great elixir will be achieved.

**Fifteenth Method: The Refinement of the Sage’s Elixir Stone**
Take twelve catties of North Pond jade-stone salt and eight catties of native dark essence. On the winter solstice, at the midnight hour of *zi*, grind the two substances into a fine powder and sift them. Place the medicine in a new eight-*dou* cauldron, add small divine water to fill it eight-tenths full, and boil until the bubbles resemble fish eyes. Stir continuously with a willow paddle, maintaining the water and fire day and night for forty-five days, until a hard, white-stone-like substance forms at the bottom of the cauldron. Drain the water, then take eight taels of unblemished soap beans and eight *dou* of divine water, crush them to extract the juice, filter it through silk, and boil the medicine in the cauldron for five days and nights. The salt will naturally dissolve into water, while the dark essence settles as powder at the bottom. Drain the numinous water, collect the essence powder, dry it in the sun, and weigh it—precisely eight catties.

Then, refine it with civil and martial fire in nine cycles. Every forty-five days, boil it with divine water for one day. The willow paddle should be cut at noon on the summer solstice from the south side of a tree, free of knots or defects, and measuring two feet four inches in length. Store it until needed for boiling the medicine.

**Method for Crafting Small Divine Water**
For the small divine water medicine, use an iron cauldron with an eight-*dou* capacity, fitted with a tight lid. Keep it filled with clear, sweet water, warmed by a constant fire, to replenish the cauldron during medicine boiling. Inside the cauldron, place one catty of mercury, half a catty of cinnabar, and four taels of sulfur, ground into powder for qi absorption. Once the medicine is fully dissolved, transfer this substance into a non-porous vessel, seal it tightly, and bury it three feet underground. When boiling medicine, retrieve it, place it in the cauldron to absorb qi, and use the warmed water. After use, rebury it until needed for refining cinnabar or casting cauldrons.

Take the aforementioned eight catties of dark essence powder, add four small taels of saltpeter per catty, and grind them together into a fine powder. Place it in a porcelain cauldron, seal the mouth, and apply martial fire to compact the medicine, leaving about two inches of space. Place it in the furnace and maintain a constant fire of one catty of mature fire around it day and night for forty-five days. Then, break open the cauldron, retrieve the medicine, grind and sift it, and boil it in a cauldron with small divine water for one *fu* period. Bind the water until it evaporates and the medicine dries—this completes one cycle.

For the second cycle, proceed as before: add saltpeter, place it in the cauldron, and apply both civil and martial fire for forty-five days before removing it. Boil it again with small divine water for one *fu* period, then bind it until dry—this completes the second cycle.

For the third cycle, mix four small taels of black donkey’s milk per catty into the medicine, blend evenly, place it in the cauldron, and maintain the same duration and fire regimen as before. Thereafter, add no further substances until the nine cycles are complete, at which point it becomes the divine water of the Flowery Pond.

This medicine hardens like stone, rings like metal when struck, dissolves into saliva upon entering the mouth, does not decay when buried, does not dissolve when boiled, and flows like molten gold when smelted. It can stabilize the unstable, subdue the volatile, lend form to minerals, and spirit to qi. It can transmute the Five Metals into treasures, and mercury encounters it and instantly solidifies.

Take a dose the size of a small bean along with one tael of mercury, hold it in the mouth, and warmth will suffuse you in an instant. When shaped like a *mian* pellet and exposed to fire, it becomes white gold. All volatile medicines submit to it at once. The Five Metals, when refined with it, become treasures—thus is the cinnabar embryo formed.

**Sixteenth Chapter: The Method for Crafting the Great Elixir, Also Called Divine Snow**

Take the small divine water medicine previously buried and cast it into a round cauldron, capable of holding nine *ge*, complete with a lid. Grind one catty of divine water sacred stone into powder, place it in the cauldron, and layer twenty-four taels of luminous cinnabar above and below it. Seal the mouth tightly with medicinal mud to prevent qi leakage. Dry it in the sun, then place it in the Eight Trigrams furnace.

Begin the fire on the winter solstice at the hour of *zi*, following the handle of the Dipper in its revolution. Gauge the heat by touching the cauldron—it should feel warmer than the human body. Nurture it for one full year, then open it to find the cinnabar subdued by fire, radiant crimson inside and out, like an unopened red lotus, its brilliance rivaling the sun. Consuming one tael dispels all illnesses, wards off malevolent spirits, imparts a lustrous complexion, grants swift movement like a galloping horse, restores youthful radiance, and calms the spirit.

Return this medicine to the cauldron and refine it with fire for another year. Upon opening, the cinnabar will appear white outside and red within, gleaming and resplendent. Consuming one tael harmonizes the body, reversing aging and restoring youth.

Refine it for another year as before, and upon opening, the cinnabar will be pure white inside and out, translucent and luminous, light as true snow. Consuming one tael bestows a maiden’s complexion, immunity to cold and heat, protection from the Five Calamities, radiance equal to the sun and moon, eternal youth, and perpetual life in this world.

Continue refining with fire according to the method until nine full years are complete, yielding the elixir known as Divine Talisman White Snow. Its wonders are unfathomable, its transformations boundless—crows that consume it become phoenixes, serpents that ingest it turn into dragons, and humans who partake ascend as immortals. One may summon the wind at will, command the rain in an instant, attract jade maidens to serve, and conjure banquets of land and sea. Drawing lines on the ground creates rivers and valleys; piling earth forms mountains and hills. Grasping soil turns it to gold, and withered things revive in splendor. The ignorant may deem one a sage, but all desires manifest effortlessly. Upon consumption, one soars to the heavens that very day.

Stones and the Five Metals melt and transmute into treasures.

**Seventeenth Chapter: The Method for Crafting the Medicine Cauldron to Receive Qi**

For the stone cauldron to receive qi: first boil two taels of alum in clear water for one day. Then add two taels of salt and boil for another day. Add two taels of saltpeter and boil for one more day. Introduce a pellet of solar essence the size of a bullet, allow it to absorb qi, then apply fire for a day to thoroughly dry it.

Combine four taels of true mother and six taels of child into a paste, place it in a crucible, add two taels of earth mother, and boil in water for one day. Add two taels of salt and boil for another day. Add one *fen* of saltpeter and boil for one more day. Transfer the mixture into the stone cauldron, seal the mouth tightly, suspend it over the furnace, and nurture it with water below and fire above. The heat should be such that it feels warm to the touch.

Every five days, open the cauldron and add four taels of mercury—the medicine atop will resemble fresh snow. In the second cycle, it gradually forms peaks and ridges. Add mercury in each cycle until one catty is reached. After ten openings, the medicine turns half-red. Thereafter, treat ten days as one cycle and one opening. After another ten openings, the medicine becomes fully red. After ten days, the embryo sheds its husk and enters the palace. Nurture it for one full year, then retrieve the medicine, refine it in the Flowery Pond, and purge its toxins in cold springs before consumption.

For the second cycle, take eight taels of mercury and eight *ge* of medicine, place them in a golden cauldron, and nurture them—this is called "Sun and Moon Endlessly Multiplying," yielding treasures beyond measure. Its myriad transformations defy description; one must experience it firsthand. Guard this secret, guard it well.
