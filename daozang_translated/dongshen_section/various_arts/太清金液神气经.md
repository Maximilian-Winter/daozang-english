### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Liquor and Divine Qi*, Scroll One

The Supreme Void and Grand Sovereign are the primordial chaos of the Great Beginning, the original numen of remote antiquity. Through obscure vastness and mysterious transformation, they wander in the Upper Clarity. They establish the Four Offices at the Celestial Pole, initiate the diagrams of change in the Eight Darknesses, ascend the Purple Void in revolving radiance, and conceal themselves in the Nine Mornings to transform the numinous. Vastly they leap through the Nine Voids of Heaven, adorning the subtle spirits in the emptiness of clarity. They ascend the Five Spirits to the Seven Origins and subtly harmonize the Six Qi in primordial completion.

Without the lofty writings of jade tablets, who could summon the wondrous perfected to the numinous ford? Thereafter, they convey the Three Simplicities to the Nine Empyreans, ride the Dragon’s Rigor in the Grand Tenuity, feast in the subtle vastness of the Purple Chamber, and subtly revolve the void in the embrace of Fu Xi. They ascend the Seven Rigors in the round transformation, suddenly dispersing their forms in the empty vastness, and inscribe the mysterious in the outer tablets.

The divine talismans and jade scripts, through nine transformations, congeal into jade tablets. The essence of jade is sealed within a thousand pieces of gold. Thus, when the Numinous Gate is opened, the Imperial Scripture is revealed, the chapters of golden radiance appear, and the luminous Dao attains perfection.

Yet the numinous auroras lie hidden in splendor, their obscure brilliance spreading laterally. They circulate in solitary transformation, their ethereal and indistinct numinosity merging. With a clap of the hands, the great light divides its radiance; with a strike upon stone, the Five Peaks shift in their courses. A soft chant gathers the crimson mornings into luminous knots; a leap carries one into the rushing shadows of the void and mystery. The Four Perfected flank them on either side, the Five Thearchs assist their majestic spirits, the Seven Governors guard the Jade Balance, and the Three Luminaries scatter their reflections in profusion.

The myriad transformations flow and shift, opening the gates of constancy and unlocking the ford of the Seven Changes. Great indeed are the numinous writings of the Supreme Void, the vermilion texts of the Chaotic Abyss, the divine talismans of the Three Marvels! Ascending the numinous gate of the Great Beginning, one who consumes a single dose may roam the Nine Heavens—how could this not be revered? Treasure it in the Hall of Luminous Jade, and guard it with the wondrous subtleties of the Grand Sovereign. Take care not to transmit it to the unworthy.

**The Numinous Strategy of the Grand Sovereign of Primordial Mystery** states:

*The jade tablets and divine talismans appear in my hall,*
*The Five Numinosities weave their affections and return to their proper place.*
*The Seven Spirits’ upright qi subdue the vermilion radiance,*
*Concealing their splendor, the mysterious diagrams harmonize the Five Phases.*
*The Three Marvels and Nine Revolutions form the lustrous jade,*
*The Supreme Void’s perfected ones refine the crimson morning elixir.*
*Immortality lies in the Golden Root,*
*Round transformation and myriad changes follow the Nine Mornings’ law.*
*One revolution completes the Nine Transformations of the Perfected,*
*The Yang Pill circulates qi and subdues the Numinous Tray.*
*Those who grasp its essence become Heavenly Immortals,*
*Ten generations of flowing virtue weave great kindness.*
*The Mysterious Gate has opened—behold my words!*
*Those who attain my Dao shall have enduring life.*
*Those who lose my Dao shall fall into the Yellow Springs.*
*Let not the vulgar and blind hear of it—*
*Be cautious, be vigilant, and do not transmit it recklessly.*

The above *Numinous Strategy of the Grand Sovereign* consists of one hundred nineteen words. It is sealed in a jade coffer and not transmitted to the world. Those who hear of it are attended by divine youths and jade maidens. It is secretly stored in a chamber of purity—do not treat it lightly, for the Three Luminaries will punish transgressors.

The Perfected of the Supreme Void says: The Jade Tablet and Divine Elixir are the greatness of the utmost Dao. They are the primordial chaos of the Great Origin, where the Five Colors flow as essences, congealing the radiance of stars, moon, and sun, aligning with the celestial diagrams. The qi of the Five Numinosities merges, the Great Yang circulates qi, the Five Stones emit their essences, and vermilion, purple, emerald, and green blaze with extreme brilliance. Those who grasp its essence ascend to the Grand Clarity, roam the Three Capitals and Six Voids, and follow their hearts’ desires. One dose is sufficient—do not seek more. This is the essential Dao: those who behold it attain longevity.

The Perfected of the Supreme Void says:

*The Three Elixirs’ essential Dao was recorded by the Grand Sovereign,*
*Secreted in the Jade Hall, not shown to the vulgar.*
*The Crimson Morning Divine Elixir was first refined by the Perfected of the Upper Realm,*
*Jade medicine enters the mouth—breath ceases, then revives.*
*The Earth-Grade Yin Elixir grants immortality,*
*Eternally round in transformation, dividing forms and dispelling obscurities.*
*It summons the traveling kitchen, with spirits as its servants.*
*One dose is worth ten thousand in gold, bestowing endless life.*
*Keep it secret, keep it secret—do not transmit its purport.*

*The Scripture of the Supreme Void’s Grand Sovereign and Great Perfection Elixir of the Dao*, also titled *The Three Luminaries’ Divine Talismans*, *The Crimson Dawn Before Slander*, *The Unyielding Flower’s Upper Elixir*, *The Eight Jade Essences’ Flying Radiance*, or *The Great Tenuity’s Purple Bright Pearl*.

In all, twenty-eight substances, corresponding to the numinous talismans of the twenty-eight lunar lodges. Engraved in the Hall of the Supreme Void, they are the Grand Sovereign Lord’s treasured script.

Those who beheld the ancient script were nine in number; it was named the Purple Bright Pearl Elixir. The Grand Sovereign Lord’s essential method for compounding the divine elixir begins with crafting two earthen cauldrons of the Great One, each holding one *hu* and two *dou*, ensuring both inner and outer walls are thick, with an inner thickness of two *cun*, made with utmost precision.

Thereafter, grind each of the twenty-eight minerals four thousand times, sifting all through silk. In total, the twenty-eight substances require one hundred twelve thousand grindings. When the preparation of the medicines is complete, use celestial mystery and earthly yellow to cover them.

Mix six catties of *di huang* with alum water to a consistency like sealing mud, then plaster the lower cauldron as a base, making it one *cun* and five *fen* thick. Place it in the sun to dry thoroughly, ensuring it is completely desiccated before adding the mineral substances. First add the Divine Lads, then the Flowing Essence, then the Divine Maiden, then the Jade Flower, and finally the remaining twenty-eight minerals. Cover them with five catties of celestial mystery. Once all medicines are placed, the two cauldrons may be joined.

Seal the seam with mud of the Great One, then dry it in the shade for fifteen days until both inside and out are firm and dense, ensuring no cracks appear. Thereafter, place the cauldron upon an iron tripod, its legs two *chi* and five *cun* high, and heat it with chaff fire.

On the first day of firing, the fire should reach halfway up the tripod’s legs. By the twelfth day, it should reach its full height, with the fire seven *cun* below the lower cauldron. By the twenty-fourth day, the fire should be five *cun* below the cauldron. After another twelve days, the fire should be three *cun* below. After thirteen more days, the fire should be one *cun* below. After eight further days, the fire may be drawn level with the cauldron’s base. After another twenty-four days, advance the fire until it is level with the lower cauldron’s belly. From the ninety-second day onward, slightly advance the fire until it is one *cun* below the upper surface of the lower cauldron. After twenty-eight more days, cease firing—altogether, one hundred twenty days.

Then, purify it for five days before opening. The medicine should be cinnabar-purple, its precious radiance resplendent, its patterns luxuriant, beyond naming. It may transform into the essence of five clouds or coalesce into the brightness of sun and moon.

Sweep it up with the left feather of a three-year-old rooster, storing it in vessels of gold or silver. At night, cover it with a descending lid. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the summer solstice, or the first days of the second and eighth months at dawn, take one pill with cold water, and you will ascend at daylight to the morning.

If you do not wish to ascend, take half a dose, and it will cause spirits and perfected beings to descend, summon the kitchens of the Supreme Clarity, and allow you to ride a dragon upward. Whatever you desire will follow your will; you will be called a Perfected of the Boundless. For a dose the size of a soybean, mix the elixir with three *ge* of pure water.

If the deceased has not been dead for three years, rinse their white bones with the elixir, and their *qi* will be restored, returning them to life as before. Pour one *ge* of elixir water into their mouth, and upon reaching their mouth, they will speak.

Perform this in a secluded place, avoiding the three luminaries.

The above is the Grand Sovereign’s Crimson Dawn, first chapter. Taking it allows you to ascend at daylight to the morning, entering and exiting the primordial void, with the myriad transformations following your heart. If, when the fire’s days are complete, the radiance has not manifested and the five colors are not fully present, it is because the fire has not been properly applied. Replaster as before and refire it. On the first day of firing, place the fire beneath the cauldron. By the twenty-eighth day, advance the fire to the top of the lower cauldron, then cease after thirty-two more days—altogether sixty days. It will surely form. Purify it for five days, then open it as before.

*The Scripture of the Great Mystery’s New Capital and the Primordial Constant’s Unyielding Seven Transformations, High Chapter the Second*

The Perfected of the Supreme Void says: The opening of the primordial returns to transformation, blending and dividing; yin and yang repeatedly change, their Dao natural. The mysterious chart revolves seven times, returning upon reaching nine.

*The Grand Sovereign’s Command and Strategy Book* says: The numinous script is eternally constant in its categories, modeled after the nine mornings. The yang light secretly emerges, the bright scenery flows like mist. Three revolutions, five changes, harmonized with the seven essences. Following their colors’ luster, each returns to its spirit. Those who attain this Dao become Perfected of the Highest Rank.

Guard it well, guard it well—transmit this with utmost care.

The Perfected of the Supreme Void says: The seven transformations of the returning primordial are the numinous essence of the supreme Dao. Their radiance outshines sun and moon, luxuriant with the ninefold brilliance. In an instant, they transform, veiling their forms within the luminous haze. Inhaling and exhaling the harmonious numen, they fill the eight darknesses. Wondrously shifting through ten thousand changes, they follow the mind’s intent. Riding the void and mounting the empty, they ascend to wander the celestial courts. At the inception of the returning primordial, those who comprehend become radiant.

The first scroll of the *Great Yellow* is called *The Jade Essence’s Command of the Supreme Perfected Treasure*, also known as the *First Primordial Scripture*. The *Great Mystery’s Primordial Constant, High Chapter the Ninth: The Sevenfold Hard Transformations of the Cinnabar Scripture* has alternate names: *The Yin-Yang Numinous Talisman*, *The Sun-Moon Mysterious Hardness*, *The Plain Brilliance’s Luminous Haze*, *The Nine Mornings’ Vermilion Chamber*, *The Instantaneous Transformation’s Numinous Youth*, *The Ultimate Brilliance’s Submerged Radiance*, and *The Eightfold Brilliance’s Numinous Cinnabar*.

First: Eight Numinous Vermilion Youths, four *jin*.
Second: Mysterious Yang’s Submerged Essence, two *jin*.
Third: Submerged Brilliance’s Numinous Maiden, eighteen *jin*.
Fourth: Mysterious Yin’s Jade Brilliance, one *jin*.
Fifth: Sixfold Fluid’s Submerged Brilliance, ten *liang*.
Sixth: Sun’s Radiance Submerged Essence, five *liang*.
Seventh: Eight Numinous Cloud Light, eight *liang*.
Eighth: Plain Haze’s Flying Hardness, seven *liang*.
Ninth: Supreme Void’s Plain Maiden, twelve *liang*.
Tenth: Numinous Brilliance’s Submerged Fluid, ten *liang*.
Eleventh: Brilliance Spring’s Water Mother, ten *liang*.
Twelfth: Moon’s Haze Submerged Hardness, six *liang*.
Thirteenth: Seven Luminaries’ Numinous Youth, five *liang*.
Fourteenth: Mysterious Hardness’ Radiant Child, eight *liang*.
Fifteenth: Numinous Talisman’s Stone Mother, nine *liang*.
Sixteenth: Yellow Primordial’s Sweet Stone, one *jin*.

These sixteen ingredients, symbolizing the numinous talismans of the nine mornings and seven primordials, bind the subtle qi of the Five Phases, modeled after the primordial chart of the Mysterious Constellations. Pound each in sequence, three thousand strokes apiece, then sift through silk. Place them within a nine-morning earthen crucible, with upper and lower crucibles each holding seven *sheng*. Cover them with seven *jin* of Supreme Yang’s Mysterious Essence, then seal the crucibles together. Coat their juncture with nine-morning earth, dry for ten days until utterly firm and desiccated. Set the crucible upon a three-tiered stand, each tier three *chi* high, and heat from below with chaff fire.

On the first day of firing, keep the flame one *cun* from the crucible’s base. By the fifteenth day, let the flame reach the base’s level. By the twenty-second day, advance the fire to the lower crucible’s midpoint. After nine more days, let it reach the upper crucible’s base. Cease after another nine days. Cool for five days, then slowly open it—the elixir should gleam with resplendent talismanic radiance, its flowing haze luminously clear, displaying eighty-one hues. Sweep it with a white rooster’s left wing feather, store it in a vessel of gold or bronze, and prevent any leakage.

On the first auspicious day of the month of Meng, bow twice, mix the elixir with pure water, and ingest one *liang*. Immediately, ninefold morning light will sprout from your crown, your face will assume the hue of Jade Youth Perfected, and numinous youths and jade maidens will attend at your side. You will ascend the void, command spirits, and ascend to the Purple Morning. Then take one *jin* of Supreme Yang’s Mysterious Essence, combine it with the elixir in a lacquered vessel at midday, and stir with a long spoon toward the sun. The next day, add another *jin*. After three days and three *jin*, store it in a sealed vessel. After three more days, the elixir will generate five-colored light—this is called the *Nine Mornings’ Three Transformations Elixir*, following the Dao of the Seven Numinous.

Take the Three Transformations Elixir, blend it with White Essence Water, and place it in a nine-morning crucible. Cover it above and below with two *liang* each of white alum’s essence, seal as before, and refine with gentle fire. On the first day of firing, keep the flame three *chi* from the crucible’s base. By the ninth day, let the flame reach the base’s level. Cease after eighteen days. Cool for three days, then open as before—the elixir should glow white, called the *First Transformation’s White Radiance Elixir*.

Combine the First Transformation’s White Radiance Elixir with Magnetite Water, cover it with two *liang* each of black magnetite’s essence, and fire as before—this is called the *Second Transformation’s Black Radiance Elixir*. Mix the Second Transformation’s Black Radiance Elixir with Azurite Water, settle it in the Gate of Flying, cover it with azurite’s essence, and fire as before—this is called the *Third Transformation’s Azure Radiance Elixir*. Blend the Third Transformation’s Azure Radiance Elixir with Cinnabar Water, cover it with red cinnabar’s essence, and fire as before—this is called the *Fourth Transformation’s Vermilion Radiance Elixir*. Combine the Fourth Transformation’s Vermilion Radiance Elixir with Orpiment Water, cover it with orpiment’s essence, and fire as before—this is called the *Fifth Transformation’s Yellow Radiance Elixir*. Thus, the Dao of the three revolutions, five transformations, and seven numinous is complete.

Place the Three Revolutions’ Five Transformations’ White Radiance Elixir within a bamboo staff to command the destruction of ten thousand demonic spirits, tigers, rhinoceroses, serpents, and locusts—pointing at them, they die instantly. Apply the Three Revolutions’ Five Transformations’ Black Radiance Elixir to the right hand, mix it with the Dark Lord’s Reverse Divination Celestial Canopy, hold your breath, and summon the four directions—immediately, traveling kitchens will arrive as commanded. Ingest one pellet of the Three Revolutions’ Five Transformations’ Azure Radiance Elixir, and above the Nine Mornings, you will ascend in broad daylight to become a Perfected of the Supreme Void under the Celestial Thearch. Ingest half a pellet, and you will attain ageless longevity, commanding spirits. Ingest one pellet of the Three Revolutions’ Five Transformations’ Vermilion Radiance Elixir, and above the Nine Mornings, jade maidens will attend you. Ingest one pellet, and above the Three Mornings, you will command spirits. Ingest one pellet of the Three Revolutions’ Five Transformations’ Yellow Radiance Elixir, and above the Five Mornings, you will ascend in broad daylight to pay homage to the Great Thearch.

Mix the above with pure water and administer it to a centenarian—their face will glow with jade light, their body will become weightlessly airborne, and they will attain the utmost spiritual communion.

The Perfected of Supreme Void says:
The Way’s numinous power lies in the Five Radiance Elixirs,
Seven talismans’ essential subtlety harmonizes primordial essence.
Penetrating the Nine Mornings, the spirit soars luminous;
Revolving and transforming, radiant light is born—
He who grasps its essentials roams the Upper Clarity.

The *Scripture of the Celestial Thearch’s Jade Hall of Supreme Void*,
A sacred writ profound and wondrous in its course.

From *The High Chapters, Third Scroll of the Upper Scripture of the Nine Yin Luminous Flower Elixir of the New Capital of the Great Mystery’s Earth Grade*:
The Perfected of Supreme Void says:
The Great Way of Yin Elixirs congeals numinous script,
Jade tablets and celestial charts array the Five Mornings.
Two sevens in paired resonance align yin and yang,
Bright pearls’ utmost radiance emits flowering mist.
Hidden light and latent fluid become vermilion nectar,
Mysterious springs’ qi coalesces, linking the Nine Mornings.
When three sevens are complete—pure and rich—
Five-colored streaming auroras luxuriant and graceful,
He who grasps its essentials ascends to the Great Mystery.

This treasure of scripture is truly secret within my scrolls,
Concealed in the Jade Hall and bestowed upon the greatly worthy.

The Perfected of Supreme Void says:
Numinous tablets and jade texts are the mysterious writ,
The Celestial Thearch’s treasure, the celestial talisman.
The Way of Yin Elixirs aligns with the Six Voids,
Sun and moon’s essence flows as script and light.
Spirit medicines latently transform into purple marrow—
Obtain and drink it, equal to luminous pearls.
He who knows this Way is a transcendent’s mate,
Let not the foolish glimpse my scriptures,
For the Celestial Thearch has forbidden it—take heed!

The Elixir of the Nine Yin Luminous Flowers of the Great Mystery,
Also named the Nine Mornings’ Yin Yang Elixir,
Also named the Plain Numinous Bright Pearl,
Also named the Moon’s Shadow Jade Flower,
Also named the Purple Jade Numinous Marrow,
Also named the Nine Talismans’ Fluid of Elixirs.

First: Flowing Essence of Primordial Yang, six *jin*;
Second: Sunken Flower of the Spirit Maiden, four *jin*;
Third: Mysterious Yin Jade Flower, two *jin*;
Fourth: Azure Shadow Flying Yang, fourteen *liang*;
Fifth: Sun’s Radiance Sunken Essence, twelve *liang*;
Sixth: Eight Numinous Cloud Light, eight *liang*;
Seventh: Plain Light Flying Yang, seven *liang*;
Eighth: Numinous Flower Hidden Brilliance, ten *liang*;
Ninth: Flowering Spring Stone Mother, twenty *liang*;
Tenth: Six Fluids’ Sunken Essence, eight *liang*;
Eleventh: Central Yellow Lad, twenty-four *liang*;
Twelfth: Supreme Numinous Sweet Flower, twenty *liang*.

In all, twelve minerals,
To harmonize the qi of the twelve spirits,
And blend the numinous talismans of the Five Phases,
Congealing the sun and moon’s radiant shadows.

Have two youths bathe and purify themselves,
Then in sequence pound each medicine four thousand times,
Sift all through fine silk.
When complete, place them into a Six-One Cauldron,
The cauldron’s upper and lower halves each holding six *dou*.
First place three *jin* of Primordial Yang Mysterious Essence into the cauldron’s base,
Then add the Flowing Essence,
Then the Spirit Maiden,
Then the Jade Flower,
Then the Flying Dragon,
Then the Sweet Stone—
All twelve minerals complete.
Press them firmly and securely,
Then cover with another earthen cauldron,
Seal the juncture with Six-One Mud,
Dry for ten days until the cauldron is perfectly sealed,
Then place it into a *si* furnace,
Two *chi* in height,
Burning horse manure or chaff beneath it.

On the first day of firing, let the flames reach halfway up the furnace’s legs.
By the twelfth day, advance the fire to five *cun* from the earthen cauldron.
By another twelve days, let the fire be two *cun* beneath the cauldron.
After another twenty-four days, bring the fire level with the cauldron’s base.
After another twenty-four days, draw the fire to the cauldron’s mid-belly.
After twenty-four days, let the fire reach the cauldron’s upper rim.
After another twenty-eight days, cease firing.
Then purify it for three days.

Gently open it, and the elixir shall gleam with radiant essence, its luminous patterns shimmering in hues of auspicious clouds. Sweep it carefully with a chicken feather and store it in a vessel of gold or silver. Suspend it in a dark chamber, and a crimson glow shall appear. On the day corresponding to one’s birth, take one *bi* with pure water—above, one’s lifespan shall equal the morning star’s endurance; ghosts and spirits shall be commanded, perfected beings shall descend, and jade maidens shall attend. The celestial kitchens shall be summoned, and the dragons of the resplendent dawn shall be harnessed. Thus, one shall soar through the void, ascending to the Purple Chamber, attaining the rank of Perfected Supreme, known as the Supreme Immortal King.

Take nine *liang* of this elixir and place it in a green bamboo tube, shaving its exterior thin. Seal the opening tightly with white wax and bury it beneath the northern pole, three *chi* deep. After thirty-two days, it shall transform into a liquid, called the Purple Essence. Then, blend the Purple Essence with three *dou* of the Mystic Water of the Nine Numinous Powers of the Supreme Purity, storing it in a new vessel. Seal the mouth with white wax, and after twenty-one days, it shall become the Mystic Water of the Nine Elixir Talismans. When the Mystic Water is complete, opening it shall reveal five-colored spiritual vapors rising in blossoms.

Take one *ge* of the Nine Talisman Mystic Water and one *bi* of the Yin Elixir, face the sun, bow twice, and consume it—ascension to immortality shall be instantaneous. Alternatively, divide three *liang* of the Yin Elixir into twelve portions and take one daily with pure water for twelve days; one shall ascend at midday. Superior practitioners who ingest the elixir need not rely on this Mystic Water. Simply consuming one *ge* of the Nine Talisman Mystic Water for a hundred days shall elevate one to the pinnacle of immortality, where auspicious clouds appear and perfected beings arrive. Should one fall ill, exhaling upon the afflicted shall cure them instantly. To summon ghosts and spirits or invoke the celestial kitchens, hold the breath and visualize—what is commanded shall arrive at once.

For one who has died three days prior, administer a grain of Yin Elixir the size of a millet seed with water into their mouth, and they shall revive immediately. For one deceased thirteen days, take a single pill, apply it to their heart, and they shall live again. If the elixir’s essence has not yet manifested, reseal the juncture and fire it for another fifteen days, keeping the flames level with the cauldron’s base. After fifteen days, advance the fire to the cauldron’s upper rim. Cease firing after twenty-one days. In total, fifty days shall have passed.

Refine it for another day, and upon opening as before, it shall not succeed in any way.

The Perfected of Pristine Emptiness said:
The essential subtlety of the supreme Dao lies within—
My spirit arrays its radiance, returning to the Four Palaces.
The Yin Elixir, though twelve in number, is also potent;
The Great Yang connects with rosy clouds, subduing crimson light.
The adept of pure numen ascends the Jade Hall;
The middling practitioner, by ingesting it, rises to the Mysterious Chamber.
The foolish and lesser practitioners soar halfway to heaven—
They must obtain the nine talismans’ resplendent hardness.
Wondrous! Wondrous! To become a King of Immortals!
Thus is this teaching set forth to ascend the Celestial Granary.

*End of the Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Divine Qi of the Golden Fluid of Grand Purity*
*(Text incomplete)*

*Lower Scroll of the Scripture of Divine Qi of the Golden Fluid of Grand Purity*

The scripture was transmitted by the assembled Perfected to Master Xu. At Du the Attendant’s residence, there were originally ten scrolls; here, only the essentials are excerpted. Among these people were Guo Zihua, Zhang Jilian, and Zhao Shuda. Later, there was also Shan Shiyuan. These individuals associated with one another, traveling together. They were at Mount Wudang and are now at Mount Dahuo, desiring to receive the scripture from the Lord of Destiny but not yet permitted.

Master Dai patted his belly, saying he possessed Xu’s scrolls—this man was the teacher of Xie Yun. The Yellow-Robed Youth is the official of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants. On the cloud-throne, there is always one who sits in quiet companionship—this is the True Person of the Great Ultimate, who comes and goes. By practicing the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*, one naturally summons the True Person of the Great Ultimate.

As the saying goes:
Ingesting the nine numina, the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon,
One attains descent into the household of my Great Ultimate—
This is what it means.

The method of the Mysterious True is also an excerpt of its essentials; those who practice it become immortals and do not die.

On Mount Liangchang grows the Firefly Mushroom. This thing, on the ground, resembles a firefly, though its substance is like grass yet not grass. It is as large as a bean, with purple blossoms, and at night emits light. Eating one opens a single aperture in the heart; eating seven opens seven apertures, enabling one to write at night. Consuming forty-seven grants a lifespan of ten thousand years.

In the mountains grows the White Mushroom, and there is also the Hidden Spring, whose water is a true purple hue. On Mount Leiping in Huayang, there is the water of Tian’s Well, which, when drunk, expels the three worms from the abdomen. It shares the same flavor as the Hidden Spring, said to be the flowing essence of jade sand. Used to wash clothes, it requires no lye—this is its marvel.

In the time of Gao Xin, there was an immortal named Zhan Shanggong, who planted plums in the land of Hidden Dragons until they filled the area. Master Zhan now serves as the Right Protector of the Nine Palaces. He often tells people: “Long ago, in the foothills of Huayang, I ate white plums of extraordinary sweetness. Though I have not thought of them for long, suddenly three thousand years have passed.” In that place, five fruits are cultivated; this land is especially suited for plums—so-called “Fortunate Land plums,” which dispel calamities and pestilence.

Before the present abode lies a pond, constructed by Guo Sichao. He raised its embankments, deepening the water, but over the long passage of generations, the pond’s walls have collapsed. Sichao often rode a small boat, playing within it, striking the boat and singing:

A clear pool girds the numinous peak,
Long forests lush with verdant green.
Dark birds soar o’er secluded wilds—
Enlightened words arise with ease.
Plying the oars, I ride the spirit-boat,
Bowing my head, I seek the morning breeze.
Unattained is the hour of liberation,
I wander carefree ‘mid hills and groves.

Beyond the Nine Abysses, waves surge;
Cultivating the Dao, I perfect my true self.
I gather these numinous phoenix wings,
Conceal my radiant dragon scales.
Exalted, this thing of a square inch—
Ten thousand gusts all turn to dust.
Pity the ephemeral creatures of dawn,
Who exhaust themselves like carts’ wheels.

Roaming the void, I descend in flight,
Treading the formless with empty steps.
The painted scene gleams with bright clouds,
Nine phoenixes sing at dawn’s light.
Flapping my wings, I fan the Celestial Ford,
Dim mists and auspicious clouds take flight.
Thus I reach the halls of the Grand Tenuity,
Embracing this golden pear nectar.
Carefree beyond the Mysterious Abyss,
Neither existing nor ceasing to be.

I ride the swift chariot of Divine Empyrean,
Clad in rosy clouds, girded with nine suns.
Exalted as the Dragon Chariot’s lord,
I return to the Northern Flower Chamber.
The spirit-tiger dwells in the jade grove,
Wind and clouds merge as one.
Opening and closing the gates of dark mystery,
The numinous transformations vanish like traces in the unseen.

Zhao Weibo was a man of Dongjun. In his youth, he studied under Master Zhang of Handan, an accomplished Daoist. Later, on the Central Marchmount, he received the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*. The *River Chart* states: “In Wu and Chu, many have witnessed the Great Peace.” He often told people: “This saying is not false; its verification is long-standing.”

Yue Changzhi presides over disasters and harms; Zheng Zhipo oversees examinations and annotations; Tang Gongfang governs life and death; Zhao Weibo manages the registers of immortals. All record those who study the Dao, along with sudden rains, numinous mushrooms, and herbs.

Completed at the hour of *yu* on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month.

Clerk Hua is to enter the oratory. At that time, nothing will remain—this is to guard against the unforeseen.

On the sixth day of the eighth month, when parents bring their infant to the oratory to burn incense, facing north to make offerings to the Three Lords, there shall appear, as before, a person clad in azure robes with leather trousers, standing and pacing before the oratory—this is the Lesser Lord. Approach and make your request.

At noon on the sixth day of the eighth month, there shall come a person wearing a flat-topped headscarf, with long whiskers, dressed in purple leather trousers and a jacket, leading a yellow-clad maiden—this is Wang Yan, the Ghost Marshal. Yan acts for others’ benefit, bringing the maiden to be seen. On that day, the maiden may be bound. Clerk Hua shall be by the well that day, assisting the master. He will come at noon and depart after a brief stay.

Beyond wondrous images of the Mysterious,
Harmonious sounds summon one another.
Numinous clouds thicken in the purple dawn,
Orchid winds fan the green carriage.
The Supreme Perfected feast in the jade terrace,
Far removed as the standard of earthly immortals.
What they await is noble and far-reaching—
Thus they excel, their talents flourishing.
Delighting in those eightfold plain writings,
The Dao’s attainment was not distant.
How can worldly affairs be foreseen?
They cause your form and qi to dissipate.

*Composed by the Lady of the Southern Marchmount on the night of the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month.*

A hymn from the Palace of the Most High says:
Hands grasp the eightfold cloud-qi,
Brilliant and clear, guarding the twin pupils.

The Supreme Perfection holds the luminous mirror,
Reflecting the radiance of sun and moon’s edge.
Cloud banners sweep past the lofty gates,
Unsealing the Mud-Pill Palace.
Myriad echoes enter the hundred passes,
The delicate maiden sits in the Dark Chamber.
The further one proceeds, the more fresh and flourishing,
The numinous spirit naturally flows through.
This hymn speaks of the canon of eyes and ears.

We, the immortals of Canglang Fangzhang,
Treasure it as the Way.
Drawn from the *Supreme Fourfold Luminous Jade Scripture*,
It is transmitted only after swearing an oath on blue-gold,
Then put into practice.

Reining in the light, descending to Canglang,
Leaping across the clear sea ford.
Crimson mists swirl in the sun’s glare,
Feathered canopies tilt the nine heavens.
The cloud chariot floats through the empty void,
Swift as the wind, serene as the waves.
Come to seek friends in the unseen,
Hand in hand to attend the Lord of Dawn.
The Prince harmonizes with bright virtue,
Together they summon the jade sages.
Below, they gaze upon the Eightfold Alas Palace,
Above, they repose on the peaks of the Rare Forest.
Rinsing with this purple jade marrow,
Only then does one know how to dispel foul bitterness.
Where does the fair one abide?
Only through diligence may one draw near.

*Written by the Lady of Yunlin Right Radiance, Royal Consort of the Clouds, on the night of the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month. Do not reply upon seeing this.*

Planning to ride to the eastern peak,
Pausing the light to summon the reclusive and still.
Virtue and power ride the waves to come,
Meeting only at the Three Mushroom Ridge.
The magic mushroom is truly edible,
Granting you endless longevity.
Om! Offer the golden nectar,
No need to wait for the hundred-fathom well.

*Bestowed by the Perfected of Pure Numinosity on the evening of the sixteenth day of the eighth month.*

This year, in the sixth month, the Long Historian was unwell—though not gravely ill. This year, the Xu family ghost caused minor disturbances, but nothing serious. If you safeguard life and await the Fan Zhonghou, I have already petitioned on your behalf. Master Chen Xu Zhao also deeply believes this; there is no cause for concern. You may summon Huang Min to come forth—Min Nu wishes to come as well. It is also said that around the end of the month, you may suffer a minor illness. If you summon them here, the ailment will be dispelled. You must arrange a quiet chamber as a priority, and prepare a room for rest. This year, when gathering herbs, set some aside for Min Nu. This year, there is a fateful [omission]—not for taking, but to have them beg for a talisman to wear for self-protection. After lying down, if you feel solitary winds, hang a screen on the north side, or place a forest near the northern wall to avoid leaving it exposed. Morning and evening, focus your mind on reverence, still your heart, and practice the Dao.

Min suffers from cholera—do not let them eat cold food. This ghost is not well-suited to staying there; for now, there is no other issue.

*Yi Qian came twice in one evening to speak of this. First, he came alone, then with Bao Ming.*

When lying down at night, visualize the solar image grasped in your hand, its red rays of light reversing from the arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the solar rays suddenly transform into fire, burning the arm until it is thoroughly permeated inside and out. Then silently recite:
At the first ascent of the Fourfold Luminance,
The qi of sun and moon divide.
Flowing light shines brilliantly,
Infusing liquid to congeal the spirit.
Great fire scatters the radiance,
Sweeping away filth and refining the mists.
Penetrating the wind and qi,
All demons burn to ash.
May you attain long life,
With limbs whole and complete.
Baneful influences and tormenting ghosts,
Consigned to the Northern Asterism.

After reciting, meditate for a long while, then release the body and forget the self.

*Bao Ming explained this, saying it follows the secret incantation method for dispelling demons.*

To the northeast of Gang Mountain lies a cave,
Connecting to the southern cave of the great Juqu’s southern mountain.
Jiang Bozhen often gathered there,
Extracting stone brain.
Stone brain lies beneath the northern cave of Fang Mountain;
Fan Yangzi once gathered and consumed it as well.
The northern mountains also contain this substance.
Stone brain resembles stone,
But is slightly mottled in color and soft.
It can be found in many places.
Consuming it often induces warmth
And prevents thirst.
When a person dies, examine their form:
If they appear like the living, it is a corpse liberation.
If the feet are not cyanotic and the skin does not wrinkle,
It is also a corpse liberation.
If the eyes remain undamaged, no different from the living,
It is likewise a corpse liberation.
Daylight corpse liberation is a form of immortality,
Not the same as corpse liberation.

The residence Master Xu is building
Has a small mountain to the east called Thunder Flat Mountain.
In the Zhou era, the Lei clan raised dragons here.
Later, Jiang Shumao and Tian Gong also dwelled here.
To the north of the mountain flows the Liuqian River,
Also called Tian Gong Spring,
Named for the man who once lived here and drew its water.

Since parting with Peng Wen, Yan Qing, and the others,
Have they all drowned in worldly affairs,
Unable to complete their studies?
The precept says:
Studying the Dao is like digging a well—
The deeper the form, the harder it is to remove the earth.
One must bare one’s heart and rectify one’s conduct
To glimpse the wellspring.
Someone told Ji Zhonghou this—
Let those who know the Dao learn from it.
It is like traveling ten thousand li to reach a destination:
Cold and heat, good and ill, plants, water, and earth—
One must experience them all.
Only then can one test their place within it.
I have heard this many times of late,
Only now do I comprehend it.
That gentleman’s thoughts are too scattered—
Can he truly cultivate far-reaching resolve?
In the past, I often regretted
That beginnings are difficult, yet goodness must not be lost.
Those who study the Dao dispel misfortune—
Take heed and apply yourself diligently.

*As spoken by the Lady Yi Qian.*

One who studies the Dao
Must focus solely on the Dao,
Direct their true emotions,
Banish scattered thoughts,
Abandon extravagance,
And preserve tranquility.
Be still as if secretly observing,
Joyful as if silently gaining insight,
Wholly absorbed as if entering a deep valley,
Trembling as if treading thin ice—
Only then have you reached the gate of the Dao,
Not yet its inner chamber.
What is called difficult is studying the Dao;
What is called easy is also studying the Dao.
Abide in profound stillness,
Preserve harmony with celestial truth,
Direct the spirit to nest in the numinous,
Refine the six palaces,
Cherish essence and subdue qi,
See nothing, hear nothing—
This is the ease of the Dao.

Those who cannot practice this—this is why it is difficult.
Lord Xu, ponder this deeply; Disciple Ying, reflect upon it well.

*As spoken by the Lady Youying.*

To instruct those gentlemen and urge them to diligence in these matters brings abundant blessings; to neglect them invites accumulated misfortune and ruin.

The Master Fan’s words—I know not who he was.
Once there was a man who loved the Dao but did not know how to seek it.
Day and night, he knelt in worship before a withered tree, pleading for longevity.
For twenty-eight years he never wearied. One day, the withered tree suddenly burst into bloom, its sap sweet as honey. Someone taught him to eat the blossoms and drink the sap, and after consuming them, he ascended as an immortal.
Such was the depth of his devotion and sincerity.
If even a withered tree can blossom with purple flowers and yield sweet nectar, how much more should the sacred stalks of the threefold radiance and the five divine mushrooms—when cultivated with reverence in mountain grottoes and cleansed of filth—flourish?
Yet how lamentable that they do not.
The reason people so often fail to attain their desires is no different from why you fail to attain yours—how could it be otherwise?

Long ago, there was Liu Shaoweng, who repeatedly entered Mount Taihua to bow in worship toward the mountain. After twenty years of this, he suddenly beheld the Elder of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the Dao of immortality.
Another man went daily to the riverbank to bow before the waters. After ten years, the River Earl appeared to him, gifting him ten pairs of white jade and teaching him the method to walk upon water without drowning. This man now dwells in the Central Marchmount, having attained the Dao.
When Zuo Ci first arrived, he too devoted himself to worship, bowing in reverence to the numinous mountain for five years before gaining entry into the inner and outer chambers of the Eastern and Western Palaces.
In studying the Dao, one should be as steadfast as Shan Shiyuan, withdraw from worldly affairs as the Pure Numinous Perfected, and tread the deep and secluded paths as Zhou Ziyang—how then could one fail to attain the Dao?
Build resolve with diligence, refine the spirit to emptiness, and ensure all actions are discreet.

*As instructed by the Lord of the Fixed Record for transcription.*

Two hundred sheets of paper, to reward Ghost Marshal Wang Yan for wielding the Record Book to ward off calamitous assemblies.
Three *dou* of oil, to reward Ghost Marshal Fu Huang for recently joining forces with the Merit Officer to subdue the fiery ghostly forms and prevent their violence.
Thirty bolts of blue silk, to reward Ghost Marshal Fan Qiang for recently intercepting a hundred evils, quelling disputes, and dispersing misfortune.
Three silver hairpins, to reward Ghost Marshal Xu Wei for recently protecting the ailing, summoning souls, and calming spirits, thereby preventing grave disputes with exceptional merit.

These four offerings were to be presented on the thirteenth day of the sixth month, when the Lesser Mao Lord temporarily assumed the form of a jade axe and appeared in a dream to Hu Ya, instructing the couple to promptly deliver these four gifts to reward the four ghostly masters.
Why do you not recall this? I may ask you again.
These four ghostly masters were originally numinous officials of the Daoist school who, having mastered the lower methods of deliverance and received scriptures, became ghostly marshals.
Now that they have been rewarded, they will serve you faithfully hereafter.
The dream took the form of a jade axe because Hu Ya’s hun and po would thereby forever commune with the immortals.
The jade axe is pure and bright, cleansing the soul after long fasting and ablutions. When the heart draws near the immortal, its image appears in dreams.
Yet if one dreams of it and still does not awaken, it shows a lack of sincere faith. If one awakens but forgets the offerings, it shows faith without reflection. Only when faith is deep and reflection keen do the offerings fulfill their purpose.
All such pledges are entrusted with secret writings and must be kept confidential, never revealed to others.
As the external scripture says: *"I have heard the command—can it be shown to others?"*
On the night of the thirtieth day of the sixth month, the Lesser Lord bestowed the book, instructing that it be shown in strict secrecy.
The True Controller of Rites states: *"Those who exert themselves over the hundred ghosts and marshaled commanders, governing with celestial authority, require these offerings."*

Ziqiao, the seventh among his elder brothers, attained the Dao, along with five sons and two daughters.
At dawn’s first light, purple clouds rise over the dark slopes.
Resplendent, the radiant orb glows,
Brilliant, it bathes the heavens in splendor.
In the vast and empty expanse, the primal essence,
The forest scatters the pure and luminous.
The Nine Heavens’ halls host the royal guests,
In golden chambers, they chant the celestial hymns.

*From the Middle Chapter of the* Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, a few lines excerpted here.*
In foreign lands, the sun is called *Zhuoyaoluo*; the Perfected of Fangzhu call it *Yuanluoyao*.
To dream of this *Zhuoluo* is an omen of the sun.
The figure within the purple clouds is the Womb Palace spirit, the Way of the Dark Perfection.
The sun’s virtue bestows its shade and moisture—a sign of longevity.
The purple clouds cradle the dawn, and the hun and po find peace.
From this, health of body and tranquility of spirit begin.

The fourfold verses have been presented; the spirit is harmonious and at ease.
*As expounded by the Lady Youying on the meaning of* Zhuoyaoluo *in the* Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern.

Whenever walking at night, one should ceaselessly click the teeth—without limit—to repel ghostly and malevolent forces.
Ghosts always fear the sound of gnashing teeth and thus dare not approach.
If one combines this with rinsing, swallowing, and reciting incantations, it is even better.

Now, the six heavens act with unchecked arrogance, while the Great Peace is faint and weak. The numinous is insufficient to aid the upright and instead invites the gathering of villains. Thus, the divine radiance scatters, and evil usurps the rightful path.
The aged have long lacked virtue; ghostly disputes have accumulated in confusion. Will you, Master Xu, set things in order?
If you suddenly embrace the Dao of Zhang Hui, I shall grant you a talisman to wear, and you will surely recover and be instantly restored.
Otherwise, you must visit the Water Bureau—alas, in your declining years, your body is frail, often afflicted by wind and cold.
You should deeply nurture and rest, savoring the supreme flavor of the Dark Primordial, dwelling by the Crimson Ford. Let your body be still and far-reaching, your heart refined in inner contemplation. Cast aside the myriad burdens, sweep away stray thoughts—only then will you draw near the gate.
If worries and entanglements are many, and worldly affairs remain unresolved, even if you rest in the numinous emptiness and abide in serene detachment, you will still fall short.

Tian Yu of Yuyang said: *"A man who drives a carriage in old age is like a bell tolling the end of the night, yet still traveling without rest—he is a sinner."*

To argue thus: the elderly indulge in their cravings and rush about in ceaseless toil, no different from the young in their pursuits. If one can now vow to abstain from such conduct, recovery will follow at once. Should this not be so, illness will advance with age—how can the heart be consulted in such matters?

Take four medicinal pills daily, one dose at a time, as repeatedly instructed above.

*"Halt the carriage, await the moon’s slow shift,
Turn the wheels back toward the azure waves.
Never have I seen such a wanderer’s path,
Yet fleetingly I wonder—how might he find peace?
Awaiting the pure spring’s return,
To unburden the heart’s forgotten longings."*

The Lady of Right Radiance chanted this thrice.

To receive the scripture yet feel shame before the master—where the true heart remains incomplete, those who pass down the teachings are not few. You, Master Su Lin of the Guarded Unity, with Tiger’s Fang leading the purification rites, may yet attain this transcendence of the world—though the measure of such a feat remains unfathomable.

At dusk, when the stars are invoked, first silently recite the star’s name, then proceed with the visualization. After the incantation, envision the star descending and resting within you. Then, gently knock the teeth together and invoke the Nine Stars and Supreme Essence:

*"Sincerity stirs through principle’s resonance,
Accumulated essence pierces the hidden truth.
Wandering, I ride the cloud’s hues,
Divine forms rest upon purple mist.
Vast and distant, I bathe in the celestial net,
Brilliant, I mount the flying wheel.
Dark wings part the gloom,
Gazing back, I yearn for renewal."*

Daoist arts comprise two hundred and one methods—two hundred and one techniques of esoteric practice. Though one may cultivate these arts, achieving bodily transformation, spiritual transfiguration, vanishing while seated or standing, soaring through the void, passing without hindrance, commanding ghosts and spirits, concealing oneself in the sea or mountains, multiplying one’s form, or binding vast armies—none of these grant eternal life or transcendence of the world, nor do they align with the Dao’s boundlessness.

The boundless Dao lies in the virtue bestowed upon all beings, without a single blemish upon oneself. Without sincerity and reverence, petitions to masters and craftsmen yield no benefit. All disciples should serve their masters with utmost devotion. At dawn and midday, first pay homage to the scripture master before proceeding with the practice.

Thus spoke Master Xu.

To the northeast of Mount Lei Ping lies a mountain commonly called Great Performance Mountain, though its true name is Mount Yu Gang, known in the *Record of Famous Mountains* simply as Gang Mountain. Below it flows a spring, where Li Ming once compounded the divine elixir and ascended to the Dark Continent. The site by the water remains to this day. On the mountain’s eastern face stands the ancient tomb of King Yue Yi.

Thus states the *Definitive Record*.

If disciples are earnest, they should massage the afflicted areas, employing this method.

Do not allow direct inward gazing at the eyes; simply swallow saliva and click the teeth.

In former times, Tang Lan, dwelling in the forests of Linlü Mountain, was struck by a ghost, leaving his entire body limp and unresponsive, as though a sack of silk floss. A Daoist master taught him this method of massage, and all symptoms were immediately dispelled.

The Northern Emperor’s Method of Flexion and Extension treats all ailments involving flexion or extension; this method is most effective—not merely for wind-induced paralysis or loss of control.

The Northern Emperor of Fengdu possesses several such methods, which are also employed by the adepts of the lofty immortals. There is also a *Scripture of Flexion and Extension*, held in the keeping of the Western Clarity Lord.

Thus are expounded the Northern Emperor’s various incantatory methods for flexion and extension.

The onset of wind-induced afflictions arises from the vulnerabilities of depleted qi. When the body is deficient or contracted, illness seizes the opportunity to invade. If one truly recovers, and earnestly reduces the burdens of constant movement, then wind-induced maladies will surely be dispelled.

Now, as for the regulation of tomb inscriptions and their annotations: though this yields modest benefit, one may also submit a memorial for tomb disputes, and I shall present it on your behalf. Thus, the flow of inscribed qi will be severed.

Formerly, Deng Yun of the Mountain Pavilion was on the verge of attaining the Dao when his hands suddenly became unresponsive. I sent word to him, instructing him to apply moxibustion at the Wind Return and Crooked Ford points. Within six or seven days, he was able to perform the Five Animals’ Massage.

Once the effects of acupuncture are complete, one should focus on the moxibusted areas, and with concentrated mind, practice the Dao—this is no different from performing the movements with the body.

In former times, Lord Zhao Cheng’s legs were so weakened that he could not rise. Morning and evening, he meditated upon bowing to the Most High. After thirty years of this, the Most High dispatched a Perfected One to bestow upon Lord Cheng a dose of Flowing Brightness Sandalwood Elixir. Immediately, he could stand and walk, and later attained the Dao. He now resides beneath Crane Cry Mountain.

When meditating upon bowing or practicing the Dao in the mind, one should burn incense on either side, as though performing the act in reality.

This is what it means to ingest and refine the Great Mystery, to practice the numinous work with the heart, to dwell in the Three Palaces, and to repose the spirit in the Six Treasuries.

Thus concludes the *Baoming* section.

The *Taiqing Scripture of the Golden Liquor and Divine Qi*, Scroll the Lower, ends here.
