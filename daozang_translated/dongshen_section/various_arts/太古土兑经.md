**The Supreme Ancient Scripture of Earthly Alchemy**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Ancient Scripture of Earthly Alchemy*. The original text does not specify an author, but it likely dates to the Tang dynasty. It comprises three scrolls. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the category of "Miscellaneous Arts" in the *Dongshen* section.

### **Scroll One of *The Supreme Ancient Scripture of Earthly Alchemy***

Earthly alchemy is the essence of Heaven and Earth, the spirit of mountains and rivers. These two entities are either nurtured by yin qi and born of yang qi, or born of yin qi and nurtured by yang qi. Through profound study and deep contemplation, one discerns the causes of transformation. Moreover, gold is born within water and earth, while silver emerges from arsenolite and orpiment. Though their material forms and Dao share similarities, tin and lead differ in nature. When applied to copper and iron, their behaviors diverge, and the outcome depends on human skill and discernment of their tendencies.

Those who study the Dao must first transmute arsenolite, then examine the furnace and fire, thirdly understand the nature of medicinal substances, and fourthly master the methods of refinement and subjugation. Without clarity on these four matters, one’s efforts will be in vain.

Gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin are called the Five Metals. Cinnabar, orpiment, realgar, and sulfur are known as the Four Yellows. Cinnabar, mercury, borax, saltpeter, salt, alum, and chalcanthite are termed the Eight Stones. Some yang medicines are subdued by yin, while some yin medicines are controlled by yang. The regulation of qi and timing is like human breath—all follow a measured rhythm.

Those who study the Dao must first regulate their qi, then discuss medicinal substances. When these two support one another, it is called the true Dao. Only those with accumulated merit and past cultivation will encounter divine texts. Guard them in secrecy, and store them deep within a golden casket.

### **The Yellow Sprout Method**
Realgar, orpiment, arsenolite, red halloysite, hematite, cinnabar, azurite, coptis, phellodendron, and cow dung juice.

### **The Dyeing Method**
Roasted cinnabar, chalcanthite (all of the above corrode qi), dragon’s blood, luminous cinnabar (preserves color), sulfur (removes tarnish), hemp ash juice, halite, gardenia decoction (for color), millet wine, perilla oil (moistens with mulberry), and floating sea foam (removes impurities). The above are used for yellowing. If employed in elixir-making, adjustments depend on the practitioner.

### **The White Medicine Method**
Curcuma, poplar resin (enhances luster), gardenia (enhances luster), chalcanthite (removes tarnish), bittern, glue solution, lime, and roasted cinnabar (the above corrode qi and also remove tarnish).

### **Copper Medicines**
Realgar, orpiment, arsenolite, mirabilite, halite, cinnabar, roasted cinnabar, kaolin, oyster shell, lime, five alums, copper acetate, calcite, azurite, iron essence, powdered boy’s feces, and old cow urine. The above are used for copper, and white medicines are also applied.

The above medicinal methods are used in the creation of white substances. The body of mercury can enter the Five Metals, and through refinement, it becomes gold powder. Thus, Master Hu Gangzi said:

*"When gold powder is added, yellow and white may be sought.
Silver refined with mercury brings no worry.
Copper refined with mercury transforms in one cycle.
Tin refined with mercury becomes harmonious and thick.
Iron refined with mercury allows the Five Metals to be cultivated.
Gold refined with subdued realgar flows smoothly in all matters.
Silver refined with subdued realgar has a clear beginning and end.
Copper refined with subdued realgar harmonizes differing natures.
Tin refined with subdued realgar completes its work.
Iron refined with subdued realgar averts danger.
Gold refined with subdued orpiment is controlled in an instant.
Silver refined with subdued orpiment transforms without doubt.
Copper refined with subdued orpiment resolves truth and falsehood.
Tin refined with subdued orpiment naturally holds firm.
Iron refined with subdued orpiment remains inseparable.
Gold refined with subdued arsenolite reveals its gate in the west.
Silver refined with subdued arsenolite unites without separation.
Copper refined with subdued arsenolite becomes soft and yielding.
Tin refined with subdued arsenolite forms furrows and ridges.
Iron refined with subdued arsenolite follows hardness and softness."*

The above discusses the Five Metals and the Dao of the Three Yellows entering them. Without the Three Yellows, one cannot speak of their harmonizing natures.

The Five Metals must be smelted to merge with one another. The marvels of yellow and white, and the additions and subtractions in refinement, reveal their authenticity when understood.

### **The Natures of Yellow, White, Red, and Black, and the Properties of Softness and Hardness**
Gold becomes hollow with silver, silver becomes porous with copper, copper contracts with iron, and iron expands with strength. Contraction yields less liquid, while expansion yields more.

Copper diverges with tin, and tin unites with iron. These are the categories of the Five Metals merging or failing to merge. Only those enlightened in the Dao, skilled in refinement methods, can artfully combine them to produce treasures like jade.

Gold is soft yet heavy. When placed in a crucible and fired three hundred times, it resembles ox dung—excellent. Silver requires no more than two hundred firings with charcoal. Copper requires no more than three hundred firings with charcoal. Iron requires no more than five hundred firings, best with coal. Lead has no fixed limit.

*"Chui"* (炊) means to blow, as in fanning the flames.

To transform silver into gold, one may use the dyeing method with subdued realgar. Touching raw mercury also turns it yellow. To introduce raw mercury into silver, first use turmeric root, red halloysite, and perilla oil to decoct the above medicines along with equal parts mercury and silver. After two or three days, it will turn yellow. The mercury can then be drawn out to make vessels. Further medicinal additions are detailed in the middle scroll. The process takes no more than twenty-one days, with adjustments made as needed.

To transform copper, dye its color and touch it with mercury to achieve a fine white. If introducing raw mercury, decoct it with sal ammoniac, clear glue, poplar resin, chalcanthite, and bittern for three to five days. Then place it in a crucible and fire it, returning it to the previous copper medicine decoction. After four or five repetitions, it becomes authentic. Adjustments depend on the practitioner’s discretion.

In the above silver medicines, the sovereign and ministers clearly interact. Among the hundred methods for the Five Metals, no more than seven or eight medicines are typically used.

Tin is inherently brittle, but when properly refined, it becomes one of the finest methods.

To subdue tin, use only asbestos, sal ammoniac, aged ox urine, and a decoction of sal ammoniac, subduing it for thirty days. If it remains unsubdued, add bittern and decoct it over a fierce fire until it is subdued—this yields a supreme treasure. Lead cannot be subdued, but if one wishes to do so, use the same medicines as for subduing tin, decocting until it is subdued—both become true treasures. If subdued male lead is introduced, it transforms into authentic yellow.

Among the Five Metals, this is not yet the great Daoist method. Only when one comprehends the Five Phases and their mutual restraint can one discuss the art of transmutation. Mastery of the Five Phases marks a person of true attainment, with the Three Corpses expelled. Thus, Master Zhang first attained the Dao before expounding these three scrolls of sacred methods, intending them for the salvation of the world and the nurturing of life. Hence, he stated this is not the ultimate great method.

To subdue mercury and transmute it into gold, first subdue lead. Once lead is subdued, mercury must also be subdued with male lead. With these substances, producing yellow is effortless, requiring no other medicines. Modern practitioners, unable to subdue mercury, resort to various medicines to assist it.

Among medicines for refining the Five Metals, none surpass subdued cinnabar; next is subdued male and female lead, and the lowest is subdued pyrite. Thus, one part cinnabar counters seven parts male lead, three parts female lead counter one part male lead, and one hundred pounds of pyrite counter one part cinnabar. When male, female, and pyrite are subdued in proper proportions, transformations manifest: silver becomes gold, iron becomes copper, and tin becomes silver. If tin is subdued by fire, it ranks among the finest methods for producing yellow.

Medicines possess the nature of *juhuo*: when burned, if they do not ascend, they are *juhuo*; if they ascend, they are unsubdued. Some mineral medicines, when burned without alteration, exert five times the potency of those that melt. Among herbal medicines, those that are firm and heavy can match three times the potency of mineral medicines.

Regarding *wenfu* (gentle subduing), mercury can stabilize herbs and minerals without requiring a single method of transformation. For *ganfu* (dry subduing), one must understand the nature of medicines and *juhuo*. If it is *juhuo*, it should remain unchanged for the duration of a meal. This is the standard for *juhuo*.

Iron can be refined a hundred times: with each refinement and forging, it becomes supple and moist, never scorched. Copper can be refined fifteen times, with each refinement followed by immersion in medicine, allowing up to twenty cycles. If the furnace fire is mastered, it can endure a hundred refinements without scorching; those without such knowledge will scorch it in three to five cycles. Silver can be refined two or three times without losing its inherent nature. Copper-silver alloys must be smelted according to copper’s method. For all true substances, such measures are unnecessary.

**Method for Subduing Mercury to Transform It into White**
- Mercury: 1 jin
- Lead from cinnabar: ½ jin
- Refined iron powder (thirty refinements): ½ jin
- Tin: ½ jin
- *Shiguan* (alum): 1 liang
- Hematite: 1 liang
- Five alums: 1 liang
- *Tesheng yushi* (a type of mineral): 1 liang
- Chalcanthite: 1 liang
- Salt: 1 jin

Melt the mercury, lead, and tin together, then add the iron powder to the crucible, cover, and heat until the mercury, lead, and tin dissolve. Remove the lid, stir to combine, then extract and grind the medicines into powder. Mix with vinegar to form a paste, place in an iron cylinder, and add the mercury. Seal the mercury with the paste, ensuring the top is firmly packed—if loose, it will burn. Coat with *liuyi* mud (a six-to-one mixture) on all sides, following the proper method. Once dry, place in a double-layered furnace and heat with a gentle fire. When the furnace glows red, seal the opening. Once moisture from the crucible lid’s vent hole dissipates, seal the hole with *liuyi* mud, applying thin layers gradually. Once dry, slightly open the draft door and apply a mild fire for three cycles, then fully open the draft door and apply a fierce fire for four cycles to complete the subduing. This mercury can be used with the Five Metals but is not yet edible.

This subdued mercury becomes true white sand; externally compounded medicines will revert over time.

**Hu Gangzi’s Method for Subduing Male Lead to Transform Yellow**
*(The method for subduing female pyrite is the same.)*
- Realgar: 1 jin
- White alum: ½ jin
- *Xuanjing* (selenite): ½ jin
- Halite: 5 liang
- Asbestos: 2 jin
- Mercury: 1 jin

First, boil the realgar and mercury in honey water for five cycles. Then, boil in ox knee ash juice for two days. Grind the remaining four medicines into fine powder, sift through silk, and mix with vinegar to form a paste of appropriate consistency. Wrap the realgar in the paste to form cakes, two *cun* wide and one *cun* thick. Once dry, coat again with the paste and dry. Place in a flat-bottomed pan: first spread dry salt powder to a depth of about two *cun*, then arrange the cakes side by side without touching, separating them with salt powder. After layering, cover with an iron lid, seal with *liuyi* mud, leaving a one-*cun* vent. Once dry, place in the furnace and heat gently until moisture dissipates, then seal. First apply three mild fires, then four fierce fires, cooling for one cycle. This subduing method is excellent. If only wet subduing is used, the color will not manifest. This subdued male lead is the finest for producing yellow. Medicines compounded from multiple substances will revert over time.

**Method for Subduing Cinnabar to Reveal Its Treasure**
- Fine cinnabar: 1 jin
- Halite: 1 liang
- Chalcanthite: 1 liang
- Alum: 1 liang
- Mirabilite: 1 liang

Grind the above into powder. Wrap the cinnabar in silk and place it in a pan atop the medicines, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Boil in lard for five days, then in bittern for five days, and finally in vinegar for five days. Mix two jin of dry salt powder with vinegar to form a paste, and coat the cinnabar with vinegar-mixed paste.

Then take the dregs of the medicines and form them into a paste, encasing the cinnabar at its center. Next, apply a layer of salt-clay over the medicinal paste and allow it to dry. Place it in fierce fire and burn for two days—once subdued without fumes, it is successfully refined. If this method is used for subjugation, it may be employed to produce yellow, serve as supreme alchemical cinnabar, or even be consumed as an elixir. Medicines compounded from other substances will revert over time. Wait until the medicine is dry, then heat it with fire, gradually increasing to fierce fire until the surface wrinkles and cracks, revealing its treasure.

**Method for Subduing Fool’s Mercury with Cinnabar**
- Tin: 5 jin (refined to 1 jin; for each addition of mercury, incorporate lard once to complete the refinement)
- Mercury: 1 jin
- White alum: 2 liang
- Roasted cinnabar: 2 liang
- Sulfur: 2 liang

Grind finely and boil in vinegar for three to five days.
For the "one white, two fools" method, use:
- Red alum: 1 jin
- Realgar: 0.5 liang
- Selenspar: 0.5 liang
- Mirabilite: 2 liang

Grind each separately into powder. Take the tin and mercury, mix with 1 jin of salt, and pound the mercury until it scatters like fish eyes, then it will be subdued into powder. Add more salt frost to a thickness of three to four cun. Spread 2 liang of mirabilite over the salt, then layer the realgar and other medicines, followed by the tin. Press firmly, then cover with the remaining medicinal powder, pressing again to compact. Seal the vessel. Using the method for volatilizing cinnabar—four mild fires and three fierce fires—cool for one cycle, then volatilize again. Grind finely, mix with 1 jin of salt, and pound together with red alum, selenspar, mirabilite, and other medicines. Volatilize once more as before—two mild fires and three fierce fires—cooling for one cycle. Remove and grind into powder. Each liang can transmute one jin into supreme alchemical silver. The tin and mercury are volatilized together. Divide the remaining medicines evenly and volatilize in two batches; the medicines will disperse during the process. To form pills, use 1 liang of jujube pulp. For powders, burn asbestos, mix with clay, and encase the powder. When applying the medicine, first refine the copper. Place three to five pills into the marrow cavity of a sheep’s shin bone and insert it into the crucible, stirring. If the medicine does not emerge, use a peach branch to stir; if it does not disperse, continue stirring evenly.

**Wei Jun’s Five Metals Formula** states: To transmute iron, one must incorporate subdued lead and tin. Medicines compounded from other substances are inferior to those using tin. Take thirty-refined iron and lead extracted from cinnabar to produce tin, then boil with fool’s mercury, adjusting quantities as needed—this will yield silver. If white mercury is obtained, it becomes supreme alchemical silver, though it is unsuitable for consumption.

**The Scripture of the Great Ancient Earth Exchange (Volume One) concludes here.**

**The Scripture of the Great Ancient Earth Exchange (Volume Two)**
The five metals are treasures of the world, prized by all. I have observed that those who study the Dao often seek myriad methods, wandering mountains and forests, indulging in leisure, taking delight in such pursuits, and claiming immortality is attainable. Yet true cultivation of the Dao does not lie in retreating to remote places but in profound contemplation to grasp its principles. Within the span of morning and evening, one may harmonize with the light, without reckless pursuit or excessive toil, thus aligning with the supreme Way. Some, upon receiving a single word or method, slander it in unison; others, possessing divine formulas, seek yellow and white alchemy. Initially, their intent was to pursue the Dao in hopes of attaining it, yet they abandon the Way, seeking fleeting gains. While this may bring temporary glory, how can it alleviate the hidden sufferings of the unseen? Countless such cases abound—this esoteric knowledge of the five metals must not be casually transmitted. The subjugation and volatilization of the five metals are the foundation of refining minerals and harmonizing the body’s qi. Here, their secrets are fully expounded. Those who seek the Dao and cultivate their nature may inherit this precious learning. It shall not be imparted to the unworthy. This volume is selected for those of like mind who share a passion for learning.

A few words on gold medicines: A single medicine requires gold. If prepared according to this method, it will suffice. For secondary yellow, if subdued male and female cinnabar are obtained, no gold nature is needed. In the methods of the middle volume, simply add subdued male lead to silver to produce true yellow. If female cinnabar is added, it can also subdue male and female cinnabar. For secondary purple, adding subdued cinnabar to yellow instantly yields supreme purple alchemical silver, though it is inedible.

For silver medicines, employ the "three-one" method: remove impurities, soften, and consume. Following this method will also succeed. For secondary white, if subdued male and female cinnabar are obtained, transmutation will yield true yellow and white. To subdue mercury, use arsenolite powder to form a paste and encase the mercury. First melt the copper, then add the arsenolite-wrapped mercury to the copper—it will turn white. Next, soften it with medicines of silver nature to produce the true substance.

Iron’s nature is foremost; it requires subdued tin and lead. Without this method, other compounded medicines may be used, though they are inferior to subdued lead and tin.

**Method for Subduing and Refining Iron**
- Lead from cinnabar: 5 liang
- Boiled fool’s mercury: 2.5 liang
- Cinnabar refined with ox knee: 1 liang
- Tin refined with ox urine: 3 liang
- Arsenolite: 1.5 liang

First melt the iron, then add the combined lead, tin, and mercury. Stir with a sheep’s shin bone for a long time, then add the cinnabar. After some time, add arsenolite to cover the surface. Heat and forge repeatedly five or six times, then pour into a mold—it will become white. One jin is the limit for refining iron.

**Method for Refining Iron Essence**
Take 4 liang of raw iron and refine it. Melt it once and quench it in millet wine. Reheat and add a rice-grain-sized amount of cinnabar and 0.5 liang of arsenolite. Stir vigorously for some time, then quench again in wine. Repeat this process thirty times to obtain the essence.

**Method for Refining Iron**

Melt and quench in ox urine fifty times to obtain the essence.

**Method for Subduing Tin**
Take tin and refine it in fermented milk ten times, then in dark essence ten times. For every jin of tin, use three liang of dark essence. Melt the tin and dark essence powder together in a crucible, stirring vigorously. Then add one liang of raw cinnabar and half a liang of refined iron, covering the surface. Place in the previous nourishing and subduing tin formula, boil with the medicinal ingredients, and it will become fine silver.

**Method for Transmuting Yellow and White with Medicinal Ingredients**
If using subdued mercury for white transmutation, it is most excellent. If using raw mercury with silver, take half a jin each of realgar and cinnabar, place in a crucible, add one liang of raw lead, and boil together in wine for one day. Pour out, then add realgar powder and mix with mercury medicinals. Pound together, then boil in millet wine for fifteen days—the mercury will turn yellow.

**Method for Subduing Mercury**
- Mercury: 1 jin
- Lead from cinnabar: 10 liang

Melt these two together. Then add:
- Fine cinnabar: 2 liang
- True *gen*: 3 liang
- Dark essence stone: 5 liang
- Sal ammoniac: 2 liang

Combine the molten lead-mercury with the above medicinals in an iron tube, seal tightly, and heat for thirty days. The subdued mercury may then be used with the five metals to produce true results.

**Method for Subduing Cinnabar** *(same method applies to realgar and orpiment)*
Take one jin of each. Grind five liang of unrefined nitre into powder, boil with vinegar for five days, then add one jin of white alum and half a liang of dark essence, along with three liang of arsenolite. Combine with the previous medicinals, boil in honey-water for twenty days, then in brine for three days to subdue.

**Method for Subduing White Alum**
First place in a salt crucible, add white alum, and heat together for one day—it will be subdued.

**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac** *(same method as for chalcanthite)*
- Sal ammoniac: 2 jin
- Dark essence: 2 jin
- Nitre: 3 liang

Grind into powder, add five *sheng* of brine, and boil for fourteen days—it will be subdued. When the brine evaporates, replenish it.

**Method for Flying Magnetite** *(same method applies to arsenolite, malachite, and azurite; arsenolite is also written as alum)*
For every jin of these medicinals, use two liang of mercury. Pound and grind together, then fly for three days and nights. Cool for one day, and it may be used with the five metals. Normally, for one jin of medicinal, use only half a jin.

**Method for Subduing Sulphur**
- Sulphur: 1 jin

Boil in brine for one day, then place the sulphur in a silk bag. Boil in ox knee ash juice for one day, then in honey-water for one day, then in mulberry ash juice for five days. Boil again in ox knee ash juice for one day, then add half a jin of mercury. Follow the previous method for three three-day cycles to complete. Remove and grind into powder. Take one *sheng* of fine cow’s milk, boil, then add the previously boiled half-jin of mercury, and boil together for three days—it will be subdued. Effective for a hundred uses, and even better for internal consumption.

**Method for Restraining Metal (Geng)**
Take ten liang of fine mountain *gen* powder, mix with one liang of subdued realgar and orpiment, and grind together. Add one liang of raw mercury and grind until no mercury globules remain. Place in a *gaoche* crucible (a small crucible used in carts, filled with oil or grease). Seal the crucible with Six-One Mud, then nurture with chaff fire for twenty-one days. Gradually increase the fire until red-hot, then allow to cool naturally without removing from the fire. The next day, break the crucible. Grind the contents into a paste, then melt in a crucible until clear. Remove—this is a supreme treasure.

**Alternative Method**

**Method for Refining Sulfur and Mercury**

Take ten *liang* of sulfur, one *jin* of mercury, and four *liang* of cinnabar-lead. Grind them together, place in a new iron crucible, and nurture for forty-five days. Then apply intense fire for two days. Remove when it turns a reddish-purple hue, grind into powder, and add one *liang* each of raw realgar and chalcanthite. Grind finely, mix with cow urine to form a paste resembling a crucible, fill with mercury, and place over fire. When three *liang* of mercury remain, it will naturally transmute into *geng*.

**Essential Secrets from the *Tai Gu Tu Dui Jing***

The methods of various schools differ in their approaches. For instance, the *Tai Qing Dan Jing* is rarely encountered—its depths elude most. Yet with the jade instructions, even the worthy like the Yellow Emperor and the Prince of Huainan abandoned their thrones in pursuit of truth. Lord Mao and Yin Xi attained the Dao and forgot worldly schemes. The *Fox Manifestation’s Powdered Charts* were passed down in three scrolls, while Master Zhang’s *Metal and Stone* was bestowed in five chapters. The mysteries of nurturing life begin with understanding *qi* and seasons. Master Tao’s discourse on medicinal properties lacked clarity on the sovereign and minister. Once this origin is grasped, the essential subtleties become known.

The confusion among schools arises thus: some expound on medicinal properties but fail to comprehend refinement; others understand refinement but not ingestion; still others grasp furnace and fire yet remain ignorant of hardness and softness in substance. If these secrets are mastered, nothing will prove discordant. Here, the arcane essentials of various classics are revealed—guard them well.

**Method for Transmuting Cinnabar into Yellow and White (for Ingestion)**

Take one *jin* of cinnabar-sulfur, three *liang* of magnetite, five *liang* of yellow lead, and five *liang* of cinnabar-lead. Prepare the mineral medicines, then add three *liang* each of white alum and arsenolite, and grind into powder. Combine the aforementioned lead, yellow lead, magnetite, and cinnabar-sulfur, and boil together for seven days until white. Next, take three *liang* each of rock salt from Yanzhou, Glauber’s salt from Guazhou, arsenolite from Songshan, and cinnabar from Beiting. Boil these with the white mercury and magnetite in vinegar for two days, then remove—this is called *liuzhu* (sulfur-cinnabar). Mercury flows like pearls, and though the name differs, the substance is the same. Add this to cinnabar-lead to form an ingot. Crush it, boil in lard for thirty days to subdue it. If it remains hard, add two *liang* of true *gen* and boil again in lard—it will be subdued. When added to the five metals, mix with saltpeter powder and realgar, then refine into cinnabar for ingestion to prolong life.

The method: First melt mercury powder, cover with salt, and refine with fire—two days of gentle fire, two days of fierce fire, then cool for one day before removing. Add five *liang* of realgar—this completes the *geng*. In the *Tai Qing Dan Jing*, the first method is for transmuting the five metals, while the second is fit for ingestion. The jade instructions clarify: refine with realgar for three more days, alternating gentle and fierce fire—it will become frost.

**Lord Mao’s Method for Subduing Mercury**

Take one *jin* of mercury, three *liang* of selenite, two *liang* each of the five alums, three *liang* of Glauber’s salt, three *liang* of halite, five *liang* of yellow lead, five *liang* of gold-tooth mineral, and three *liang* of cinnabar. Grind all into powder, then boil the mercury and medicines in an iron crucible with good vinegar, maintaining a simmer like fish eyes. Replenish the vinegar as it evaporates, adding gradually over five days. After twenty days of boiling with the medicines, the mercury will be subdued and ready for use with the five metals.

**Fox Manifestation’s *Mysterious Pearl* Method** *(This method is absent in the *Wu* text)*

Take one *jin* of *xuanzhu* (mysterious pearl), five *liang* of unrefined lead powder, and two *liang* each of true *gen* and selenite. First melt the lead in a vessel, then add the *xuanzhu* and mix. Melt the *gen* and mercury separately, then combine with selenite. Grind one hundred times, boil in vinegar for thirty days, then remove. If not subdued, add one *he* of *heche* (human placenta) to ensure subjugation. Next, take two *liang* of iron essence powder, mix with four *liang* of tin, and stir together. Grind into powder, add to the previous mercury, and boil for five days—it will be subdued.

**Method for Subduing Realgar** *(Applies also to orpiment and cinnabar)*

Take one *jin* of realgar, three *liang* of chalcanthite, one *jin* of white alum, five *liang* of selenite, and three *liang* of asbestos. Grind all into powder. Break the realgar into wheat-grain-sized pieces, place in a silk bag, and boil in vinegar with the other medicinal powders for twenty days. Remove, mix the realgar with vinegar, and shape into cakes. Use the boiled medicinal residue as mud to wrap the realgar cakes. Place in a salt cauldron and fire for ten days—this subdues it well, similar to subduing the five metals. It may be used interchangeably with them.

**Method for *Xuanhuang* Ointment**

Use subdued mercury, subdued realgar, subdued orpiment, subdued cinnabar, and subdued malachite. After refining each three times, further refine with water and wine. Use processed *fu ling* from Shangdang, ginseng, and pine resin; boil with ash water from mulberry firewood, coptis, and honey; and harden with apricot kernels. Boil in water for seven days, replenishing with warm water as needed. This is the method.

Alternatively, combine the subdued medicines with raw medicines: for every two *sheng* of honey, use half a *jin* each of herbal and mineral medicines. Avoid excessive fire, which blackens the medicine. Apply gentle heat and refine for fifteen days, stirring with a dry willow stick until it forms a paste. Grind all medicines into powder and place in a cauldron. If the honey is exhausted, add more. After the allotted days, take one spoonful on an empty stomach with wine—after a hundred days, one becomes an immortal. Avoid the five pungent foods, the meat of the twelve animals, and unclean places.

For transmuting into gold, add half a spoonful of this ointment to one *jin* of mercury—it will become superior gold, also fit for ingestion. Place mercury in a green bamboo tube without a lid, boil continuously with vinegar for four days and nights until the black smoke dissipates, then remove and shape into cakes.

When introduced to fire, this ointment subjugates mercuric frost. By refining this paste, both mercury and its male-female forms are stabilized.

**Coptis and Apricot Kernel Ointment**
Grind equal parts coptis, apricot kernels, and black soybeans into powder. Mix with one *sheng* of honey and half a *jin* of each medicine. Refine over gentle fire for fifteen days, following the previous method. Take one spoonful with wine on an empty stomach. It may also be used for transmutation, possessing wondrous alchemical properties.

**Verse:**
Return my two pastes,
Spare me divine toil.
Destroy my two pastes,
Condemn me to celestial courts.

The Greater and Lesser Elixirs, with their transmutative power, share a single principle—thus, no further elaboration is needed.

**The Great Elixir**
When mercury is subjugated, the eight minerals are likewise subdued. Knowing the roles of sovereign and minister, and refining with intent, one follows ancient methods with minor variations. Though schools differ in number, success lies in careful adjustment—thus, the Reverted Elixir is achieved.

**Verse:**
With three reversions at home,
Heaven and earth resound in glory.
If refining one mineral,
Two persons craft the wondrous elixir,
Which also bears transmutative power.

Perusing these three volumes of sacred methods, one may, through thoughtful adaptation, produce gold and silver.

**The Thirty-Six Waters of the Great Elixir**
With saltpeter alone, nothing is unattainable.

**Mica Water Method**
Combine one *jin* of mica, half a *sheng* of scallion juice, half a *sheng* of honey, and half a *jin* of cassia juice. Seal the mixture in a bamboo tube with lacquer, bury it for seven days, and it will liquefy. If not fully dissolved, steam for one more day, then suspend it in a well—it will transform into water.

**Jade Water Method**
Grind one *jin* of jade and one *fen* of magnetite into powder, then mix with one *fen* of cloud liquid. Seal and bury for ten days as before to form water.

**Stabilizing Male-Female Elixir Liquid**
For each *sheng* of mica, blend one *jin* of saltpeter with one *jin* each of male and female mercury powder. Seal and bury following the above method to produce elixir liquid.

**Purple Oil Elixir Method**
Combine one *jin* each of mercury and male mercury. Grind and knead them together, wrap in dough, and steam with millet. Replace the mixture in the crucible three times daily for one day. Then grind the mercury three times, place it in a copper vessel with half a *jin* of saltpeter, and bury it for ten days. Add another *jin* of saltpeter, boil in a double boiler for four days—it will become a paste. To refine it into Purple Oil Elixir, grind with mercury, place in a copper vessel, and heat gently for three days and nights until the color subtly shifts. Then increase the fire for nine days and nights; though the hue changes frequently, do not be alarmed. On the ninth day, it will turn purple. After stabilizing it for a full day, heat it intensely for six days and nights—it will blaze crimson, signaling completion. When used to transmute lead, it yields a lustrous, five-colored metal.

**Fire-Subduing Purple Powder Method**
Combine one *jin* of mercury with half a *jin* of sulfur. Refine using the method for subjugating minerals, then skim off the resulting purple powder. It may also be heated in an iron bowl until smoke dissipates before use.

**Purple Oil Elixir’s Subjugation of Mercury**
After extracting lead essence, place two to three *liang* of raw mercury in a crucible with a small amount of ash. Add Purple Oil Elixir mixed with lead and tin powder, cover with more ash, and place in an ash furnace. Heat five times, lifting and lowering the crucible, then finally heat until the crucible glows red. Pour onto the ground—it will become gold.

**Iron Powder Water Method**
File iron into powder, soak in black cow’s urine overnight, then layer in an earthen vessel with emblic myrobalan powder—thirty-one layers in total. Seal tightly and bury in the northern shade of a house for twenty-one days to complete.

**Refining Lead Bloom Method**
Melt one hundred *jin* of lead in an iron furnace, stirring constantly with an iron spoon as in the yellow lead method. Each hundred *jin* yields ten *jin* of bloom.

**Transmuting White into Yellow Method**
Place dried mercury in a Gong County crucible, mix with fire-subdued male and female yellow, and seal. Coat with medicinal mud in three layers, then refine with gentle and strong fire for twenty-one days. When the fire’s color stabilizes, the yellow will be complete.

**Purple Mud Method**
Combine one *jin* each of yellow lead and realgar with five *sheng* of vinegar. Soak the medicines briefly, then sun-dry. Repeat until the vinegar is fully absorbed. Place in a crucible and heat with gentle fire until the color turns red—stop then. If the fire turns white, its potency is lost. If it becomes ashen, it is unusable.

**Gold Powder Method**
Melt one *liang* of *dui* with five *liang* of mercury. Grind with three *liang* of *diwei* into a paste, place in a crucible, and refine. Wash away the *diwei* and grind the residue into powder for use.

**Refining Yellow Washing Powder Method**
Combine one *jin* each of *diwei* and yellow fat with one lump of bloom powder. Mix with one *sheng* of coarse ash and refine over fire for ten days to complete.

**Excerpts on Minerals and Metals**
Clarifying Sovereign and Minister.

Lead and mercury serve as the sovereign and minister of minerals and metals. Lead acts as the sovereign, governing the five viscera, while mercury acts as the minister, expelling the Three Corpses. Azurite serves as the messenger, brightening the eyes. Cinnabar acts as the general, subduing the four barbarians. Refining these four divine medicines and ingesting them grants longevity.

**On Ascension and Subjugation**
There exists yin ascension, yang subjugation, yang ascension, and yin subjugation. Lead can restrain mercury, hence "yin subjugates yang." Mercury can subdue lead, hence "yang restrains yin." One *liang* of sulfur can subjugate five *liang* of mercury—this is yang subjugating yang. Thus, it is known that mercury’s power is not equal to lead’s. When sulfur enters mercury, it is called ascension; when lead is added to mercury, it is called subjugation.

**On Yin and Yang**
That which ascends is yang; that which restrains is yin. Ascension that becomes subjugation reverts to yin. Subjugation that becomes ascension returns to yang. When yang is subjugated and ascends, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. When yin ascends and is subjugated, yang reaches its extreme and yin is born. To subjugate minerals and metals, one yin and one yang must harmonize. To subjugate yang with yang or yin with yin will never succeed. When sulfur and mercury form frost, blend it with one *liang* of nine-times-refined lead essence and ascend it again. Ingesting one *daogui* transforms a person. Adding raw mercury to lead and ascending it for nine days produces frost, which must settle upon the subjugation vessel. Each *liang* transforms into a *jin* of treasure, and ingestion prolongs life.

**On Hardness and Softness**
When lead is added to mercury, it becomes hard; when mercury is added to lead, it becomes soft. Though mercury is soft, when combined, hardness and softness subjugate each other. Mercury and lead can soften the nature of hardness and the properties of other substances. When softness is attained, it becomes hard; when hardness is attained, it becomes soft. Without lead and mercury, the transmutation of the five metals will never succeed.

**On Floating and Sinking**
Gold is heavy and sinks; minerals are light and float. When ingested, they paradoxically ascend, and when gold is obtained and fused, it cannot float. Thus, it is said that one mineral can pierce one gold—this is also called the name of *huandan*.

**On Resemblance**
Lead and realgar share kinship, both deriving from the class of metals. Cinnabar and realgar resemble *paosha*; without *paosha*, their color does not manifest. Lead is the sovereign of metals, and realgar is the sovereign of minerals; thus, lead can transform minerals and metals. Without realgar and lead, transmutation will never be wondrous. Without the four yellows to catalyze transmutation, it will also never succeed. Cinnabar can also subjugate and transform the five metals and eight minerals, appearing in honey water like a mother. When sulfur is properly subjugated, its original color remains unchanged, yet it can transform and dye minerals and metals. It can be melted with magnetite into a liquid, resembling *shitingzhi*; *pi* resembles *shinao*; it solidifies instantly and does not ascend. Cinnabar resembles fermented wine; lead resembles mulberry ash; tin resembles *mituoseng*; azurite resembles *daizhe*. In discussing resemblance, when yin and yang harmonize, transformation proceeds smoothly.

**On Incompatibility**
Gold detests mercury; silver detests raw iron and *paosha*. Gold is weakened by silver; silver is loosened by copper; copper is strengthened by iron but ruined by tin. The five metals and eight minerals all detest *yuganzi* and *daizhe buhuimu*, which can dissolve all metals and minerals into water. Without saltpeter, transmutation will never succeed. When lead, mercury, cinnabar, realgar, and all fire-subjugated minerals and metals are tested by fire, if the fire does not move them, if they do not flow when fanned, and if their color lacks luster, they cannot transform other metals and minerals.

**On Nature and Spirit**
Cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang, the child of the sun, and possesses generative power. It can cause all metals and minerals to ascend. Without mercury, none can ascend; with *daohang shengu*, they ascend together instantly. Use chalcanthite, yellow vitriol, and white vitriol as messengers; gold and silver as the mother; azurite as the general; and the four yellows as the sovereign. Among the four yellows, none surpasses realgar. Among the three blues, none surpasses azurite. Realgar communicates with the divine; azurite brightens the eyes. The finest method involves steaming the three flowers of *dajiezi*; next, boiling it with lard, which also moistens it, is wondrous. Avoid cold and heat clashing, as this can reduce it to powder.

The finest cinnabar, when placed with red *guan* and yellow salt, covered and nurtured in a ceramic vessel over fire for ten days, is called *lizhi shenfen*. It can transmute mercury into *zigeng*, soften the five minerals into soft gold, and is also called divine and wondrous. It can further transmute superior *geng* to solidify the spirit. Sulfur, when combined with Tibetan purple vitriol, instantly transmutes mercury into gold. Persian red salt does the same. Without other medicines, both yield supreme treasures.

To create *geng*, first refine lead and subjugate realgar and mercury, then subjugate the four yellows. Subjugating just realgar and mercury suffices to produce true treasure. Without other medicines, blending these two and combining them like earth and gold, covering them with yellow and red salts, and refining them with clear, gentle fire for fifty days yields *ziguang dan*, which can transmute the five metals. To transmute silver, use azurite and *daizhe*. Subjugating *jingong* can be swiftly achieved with *feishuang tang*; combining *shitingzhi* and *dinüxue* with mercury and silver sand, then nurturing with fire for a hundred days, produces *geng*. Boiling one *jin* each of *huangtong* and *dinü* into a liquid for thirty days preserves their nature. This can also subjugate mercury. When mercury is born of sulfur and refined with the six spirits, it becomes red frost.

For impure metals, adding *paosha* reveals their authenticity and equalizes their color. *Qilinjie* can also fix color. Millet wine softens; gardenia dyes; *yuganzi* purifies impurities; *daizhe* enhances color and beauty; yellow vitriol can dye all metals, minerals, and cinnabar. When *touzhi* is added a thousand times, it becomes silver, soft as mud. Ingesting it prolongs life, greatly strengthens sinews and bones. Cinnabar refined with *paosha* becomes pure.

Refined Silver Mercury—Lead undergoes nine transformations, while mercury is called the sevenfold return. When combined and boiled with *qiang*, after sixty days it becomes like dust, then sublimated like molten silver, forming the cyclically returning elixir. It can enter the five metals, preserve youthful complexion, slay the Three Corpses, expel the Nine Worms, harden its nature, and soften its substance. When lead and mercury are conjoined, their body becomes hard; when entering the five metals, their nature turns supple. It can subdue gold and lead, and react with mercury and lead. When lead and mercury merge, it is also called the sevenfold return. If sulfur is added and sublimated, it becomes the ninefold lead. When refined nine times with *qiang*, it is also called the nine-five-seven return. Use three *sheng* of *huachi*. Two *sheng* of grass and wood ash, repeatedly leached five times, then decocted for a day. After boiling with *caizhi* for three days, pour it out, then boil it in soapberry ash liquid until purified—only then can it be used.

Luminous Yellow Sprout—Take the ninefold lead and sevenfold return, combine and sublimate them seven times to form subdued frost, then gather the frost and mix it with *hua*, kneading it into moistened balls. Place them in a three-tiered crucible and smelt them until they resemble silver, though hard and unable to withstand fire. They can enter the five metals but are not yet fit for ingestion. Smelt them seven more times, then refine them with *ziming* until silver, lead, and mercury merge and become fire-subdued—this is called medicinal lead. Further refine this medicinal lead in an underground crucible to produce the yellow sprout. Grind this yellow sprout with raw mercury and sublimate it: the portion that rises is called *Light Ascension*, while the portion that does not rise is called *Water Mother*. The rising portion clings to its mother, thus remaining above; the non-rising portion is the mother clinging to its child, hence the division into upper and lower sublimates. Without distinguishing their use, they are applied alike.
