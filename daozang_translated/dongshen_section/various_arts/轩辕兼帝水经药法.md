**Preface to The Yellow Emperor’s Water Scripture**

It is said that the numinous transformations of ten thousand ages arise from distinct origins. The *Gen* trigram begins with a single *qi*, and the Three Powers stand together, transmuting the mortal frame into sageliness. Common stones are refined into treasures—this is the natural order. In the world, plants and trees undergo transformation in a single autumn; when humans ingest them, their years extend a thousandfold. How much more so, then, the waters born of ten thousand years of mutation? Can they not elevate the mortal to the sacred? This, too, is the principle of nature.

Formerly, Xu resided long in the mountains, traversing the fields of learning. He could be said to have refined the elixir yet never perfected it, sighing in vain. While wandering by the Lotus Stream Grotto of Mount Tiantai, he encountered an ancient immortal, whose origins were unknown. The immortal said: “I possess the wondrous formula of the Returned Elixir. Are you willing to pursue it?” Xu prostrated himself and replied: “I have long sought it, yet never succeeded.” The immortal said: “To return or not—do not weary your heart. The Dao of immortals is naturally effortless.” Thereupon, Xu followed him for five years. Later, he saw the ancient immortal transform a blade of grass into a dragon and thus understood the Way. Bowing again, he said: “I humbly beseech my master, in compassion for all beings, to deliver those sunk in suffering. Though unworthy of formal instruction, I beg but a small safeguard.” The immortal replied: “You shall attain the Dao in due course. The time has come. I possess a scroll of the *Water Scripture*; I shall entrust it to you.”

Before the immortal could finish speaking, three others suddenly arrived. The immortal said: “These three also have a share in the Dao.” He bestowed the *Water Scripture* upon the four, and within half a generation, all achieved immortality. Those who encountered this scripture and attained the Dao numbered over three thousand. The medicines and methods herein are arranged according to yin and yang in the following sections. Their numinous marvels and transformations are boundless, with not a single error.

Composed on a *jiazi* day of the cyclical year, in the season of harvest.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Water Scripture of Alchemical Methods**

**1. Divine Cinnabar Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of divine cinnabar, grind it to a fine powder, and levigate it three times with well-blossom water. Dry in the sun. Add four *liang* of brocade-hued dragon sprouts and one *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Again, levigate with well water to remove the brocade-hued dragon sprout residue, then dry in the sun. Next, take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind them finely, and mix with the previous preparation. Take a fresh bamboo tube of suitable size, place within it a pill the size of a pellet. Add half of the finely ground chalcanthite and nitre, then the cinnabar powder, and cover with the remaining half of the chalcanthite and nitre. Seal the opening with lacquered bone powder, bury it three *chi* deep in a yin location, and retrieve it after forty-nine days. It will have transformed into water. Pour into a silver or stone vessel—its radiance will dazzle the eyes.

If one consumes a clamshell measure, the turbid waters of impurity will recede at once, granting longevity, the sight of spirits, and freedom from cold and heat. After a hundred days, one will feel the body lighten, remain wakeful day and night, fear no peril, and walk as if flying, swift as wind and rain. After a year, spirit attendants will guard one, tigers and dragons will submit, and all matters will be foreknown, as if by divine prescience. Consuming two clamshell measures, one may traverse the Nine Heavens above and the Nine Earths below, appearing and vanishing at will, mastering all without obstruction. After three measures, within a hundred days, one naturally attains the Dao of celestial perfection, shedding the mortal husk to ascend beyond the Three Realms, becoming a body of supreme immortality and realizing the formless state beyond all things.

**2. Realgar Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of realgar, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water. Dry in the sun. Add two *liang* of scallion and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. The resulting liquid in the vessel will be red-yellow, with no other effects. It may only subdue all manner of creatures, whether flying or crawling, as described in the previous method.

**5. Pumice Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of pumice, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water. Add two *liang* of powdered seaweed and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Remove and levigate with well water to eliminate the seaweed residue. Then, take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury five *chi* deep in a yin location for fifty days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be extraordinary, though it has no other effects. If one consumes a clamshell measure, one may enter water without drowning. After three measures, one may visit the Dragon King and naturally gain his favor.

**6. Quartz Crystal Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of quartz crystal, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water. Add four *liang* of powdered red lotus petals and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Pour into well water to levigate and remove the lotus residue. Then, take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury three *chi* deep in a yin location for forty-nine days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be luminous and white as frost or snow.

If one consumes a clamshell measure, there are no other effects, but one may walk through fire as if treading solid ice, without fear.

If one consumes two *shen* of clamshell measures, the body will burn as fiercely as glowing coals, yet one may lie upon bedding as usual. If one consumes three clamshell measures, one may sit day and night amidst blazing fire without the slightest fear, as though dwelling in an ordinary chamber.

**7. Actinolite Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of actinolite, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water. Add two *liang* of powdered asbestos and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Pour into well-blossom water to levigate and remove the asbestos residue. Then, take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury three *chi* deep in a yang location for forty-nine days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—if one consumes two clamshell measures, there are no other effects, but one may rise a hundred *chi* above the ground and extend one’s lifespan by three hundred years.

**8. Jade Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of jade, first soak with four *liang* of carpesium seed and half a *jin* of flying squirrel droppings in one *sheng* of light rice-water in a porcelain vessel for twenty-one days. Remove the jade, then add three *liang* of carpesium seed, four *liang* of flying squirrel droppings, and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Levigate with well-blossom water to remove the herbal residue, then dry in the sun for approximately half an hour until the jade emits a sound and naturally crumbles to powder. Take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury three *chi* deep in a yin location for forty-nine days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be a luminous green, resembling radiant light. There are no other effects. If one consumes three clamshell measures, one may extend one’s lifespan by one thousand years, for this is true jade nectar.

**9. Gold Crystal Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of gold crystal stone, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water.

Remove, then levigate again with well water to remove the *shencao* residue. Take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury three *chi* deep in a yin location for forty-nine days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be a deep yellow. For every *jin* of mercury, add half a clamshell measure of this water and stir evenly; soon the mercury will dry. If fanned with fire, it will naturally form molten gold, and when poured out, it will solidify into lustrous red gold, its color most pleasing. There are no other effects.

**10. Silver Crystal Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of silver crystal stone, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water. Add two *liang* of powdered crane’s-crest grass and three *sheng* of bitter wine to a silver or stone vessel, and simmer until the wine is exhausted. Remove, then levigate with well water to remove the crane’s-crest residue. Take four *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre, grind finely, and mix with the preparation as before. Bury three *chi* deep in a yang location for thirty days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be like jade. For every *jin* of mercury, add half a clamshell measure of this water and stir evenly; soon the mercury will dry. If fanned with breath, it will become fine silver of the highest grade. It may also be used to refine raw tin into treasure.

The methods for preparing the above waters follow the same process as for silver crystal stone water, with the addition of half a *liang* of wolfberry herb powder during simmering. Each may be used to dry mercury and refine tin, and to subdue all volatile substances, rendering them all fire-resistant.

**22. Magnetite Stone Water**
Take one *jin* of magnetite, grind to a fine powder, and levigate three times with well-blossom water.

Bury three *chi* deep in a yin location for forty-nine days to form water. Upon retrieval, pour into a silver or stone vessel—its color will be a lustrous black. If one consumes one clamshell measure, there are no other effects, but one may remain unharmed amidst a hundred blades striking simultaneously. It may also shatter all hard and stubborn objects, which will crumble effortlessly at the touch.

**23. Drunken Tin Refinement Water**
Take three *liang* of arsenic powder, place in an iron pot, and seal with a lid. Pour three *dou* of mulberry leaf ash lye into the pot and simmer over gentle and strong fire alternately, regulating the heat evenly until the lye is exhausted. Remove the preparation, refine in a crucible to form a liquid, then pour out and grind into powder for use in breaking down tin. Take ten *liang* of red tin, melt into a liquid, add one *liang* of the powder, and stir until the sound ceases. Pour into boiling wine, then transfer to a black bone vessel and refine again as before to naturally form the substance. Repeat this process three times, and it will become as white as snow. For every ten *liang* of tin, add six *liang* of *shanze gen*, and melt together to form a liquid that will naturally turn white. It remains unchanged even after a thousand fires, and its craftsmanship is exquisite—white as congealed fat, tender as spring snow. It may benefit the world and endure for a thousand years without decay.

**Verse:**
When white arsenic meets ash lye and simmers,
The immortal’s secret art refines drunken tin.
Formed on another day, divide into ten portions,
Once ten *liang* are used, melt in the pot.
When the tin fragments become golden liquid,
Add the white glue at the right moment.
Stirring, the mercury dries in an instant,
And with a fan’s breath, it becomes silver of the finest quality.
