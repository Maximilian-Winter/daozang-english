**The Sixteen Transformations of Qi-Eliciting Golden Elixir**

Take sixteen taels of the *Mother* and carve it into sixteen blocks, hammering them according to method until solid and free of sharp edges.

Prepare an indeterminate amount of mulberry firewood, dry it in the sun, and burn it to yield roughly one *dou* of ash. Sift the ash through a sieve, then leach it with boiling water to obtain one *dou* of lye, which is to be stored in a clean vessel.

*Gusuibu* (also called *tu hou jiang*), with its leaves and bark removed, and *qiannian run* (also called *di wugong*), washed clean of soil and drained of moisture, including leaves, stems, and roots—weigh out two *jin* of each of these two herbs. Pound them in a stone mortar until pulverized, then strain the juice through new cloth. Dry the residue and pound again, repeating this process eight or nine times until roughly one *dou* of juice is obtained. If the juice does not reach one *dou*, knead the residue with the previously prepared lye and continue pounding. Store the combined liquid in a clean vessel.

Take one sand pot capable of holding three *sheng* of water. Place the pot on an iron tripod, then pour the lye and herbal juice into it, filling it only six or seven parts full. Suspend the *Mother* in a small bamboo basket and lower it into the pot. Heat the liquid over a charcoal fire, keeping it at a constant boil without allowing it to overflow. Frequently ladle the lye and herbal juice over the *Mother* as it cooks. Continue this process for one *fu* period. If the liquid diminishes, prepare additional lye by leaching the mulberry ash with boiling water, then combine it with the herbal residue to replenish the pot. Cook for another *fu* period.

Upon completion, remove the basket and take out the *Mother*. Wipe each block clean with a dry cloth to remove any residue, then place them in a sand container. Use a large container from Xinzhou, which should be able to hold all sixteen blocks of the *Mother* arranged at its base. Seal the container’s rim with a paste of vinegar and clamshell powder. If clamshell powder is unavailable, red halloysite may be used instead, which is even better.

Allow the container to rest undisturbed for one *fu* period, applying four taels of fire at dawn and dusk. The following day, open the container and pour four taels of mercury onto the *Mother*. Seal it as before, then place the container atop a water cauldron. The setup is as follows:

**Furnace Design**
Construct the furnace from clay or fire it from pottery. It should stand two *chi* and two *cun* tall with a diameter of one *chi* and two *cun*. The top should have two openings the size of a broken coin, and the bottom three openings the size of a small copper coin.

**Water Cauldron Design**
The water cauldron should be a ceramic vessel capable of holding three *sheng* of water. Its mouth must match the base of the container in size. Fill the cauldron with boiling water to six or seven parts full each time it is used.

**Fire Nurturing Method**
Use the ash of paper money in the furnace. Once the setup is complete, nurture the fire according to method. Place four taels of fire in three pieces atop the container, allowing it to glow red-hot without extinguishing. Cover with ash, and at dawn and dusk, replenish the fire. After seven days, when the fire is sufficient, cool the furnace, open the container, and observe: the mercury will have transformed into a fish-scale pattern, resembling frost, weighing four taels.

Add another four taels of mercury, seal as before, and place the container back into the furnace. Replenish the water, seal the cauldron’s mouth, and apply four taels of fire at dawn and dusk for seven days. Upon cooling and opening, the mercury will have dried into formations resembling jade canine teeth, now weighing eight taels.

Add another four taels of mercury and repeat the process. After seven days, the mercury will have dried into formations resembling horse teeth or *langgan* jade, now weighing twelve taels.

Add another four taels of mercury and repeat the process. After seven days, the mercury will have dried into formations resembling a forest of jade trees, now weighing sixteen taels.

Add another four taels of mercury and repeat the process. After seven days, the mercury will have dried into *Yellow Sprouts*, now totaling twenty taels.

Refill the water cauldron, place the container atop it, seal as before, and nurture the fire for another seven days without applying heat. Open the container and remove the *Yellow Sprouts* to form the Great Elixir. If one wishes to preserve them as a treasure, they may be kept; if not, they may be refined as before without loss of weight.

**Nine-Fold Stir-Frying of the Sprouts**
Take two *qian* each of saltpeter, nitrokalite, alum, and table salt, and grind them into powder. Place the *Yellow Sprouts* into a sand pot, then cover them with the four powders. Set the pot over a fire, stirring continuously to prevent the medicine from boiling over. If it threatens to overflow, sprinkle soapberry water to suppress it. Once the medicine no longer surges, cover the pot with a *jian* bowl and seal the edges with damp paper. When the sound within ceases, remove the bowl and discard the liquid from the four powders. Retrieve the *Yellow Sprouts* and wash them to transform them into *Red Powder*.

**Ten-Fold Washing Method**
*"Purple Robe and Golden Belt, vivid in hue,*
*Seal the vessel’s mouth, guard the secret true.*
*With Du and Fang as aids in due measure,*
*Steep with cinnabar in water’s embrace to refine the treasure."*

If not refining into a worldly treasure, omit *chuanwu*; otherwise, include it. Combine *baiji*, *bailian*, *duzhong*, *fangji*, and *chuanjiao* (sealed-mouth variety). Weigh out two *qian* of each of the seven ingredients.

Chop them to the size of hemp seeds. Place the herbs in a pot with flowing water, then wrap the *Yellow Sprouts* in new cloth and suspend them within. Set the pot on an iron tripod and boil for one hour, replenishing the water as it evaporates. Once the fire is sufficient, remove the bundle, unwrap it, and dry it to transform the *Yellow Sprouts* into *Red Powder Great Elixir*. If refining into a worldly treasure, proceed to refine the *Yellow Sprouts*. At this stage, utmost caution and strict abstinence are required.

**Eleven-Fold Transformation into Red Powder**
Grind the *Yellow Sprouts* finely and place them into a sand container. Seal the rim with a paste of vinegar and clamshell powder as before. Set the container on an iron tripod and place it into the furnace—at this stage, the water cauldron is no longer needed. Apply four taels of fire at dawn and dusk, nurturing it for one hundred and twenty days.

Remove the fire, take out the container, and open it to inspect—all has transformed into red powder. Grind the powder into a fine dust, then fill a clean basin with water to eight or nine-tenths full. Pour the red powder onto the water’s surface; the light and pure particles that float are gently lifted with paper, dried in the sun, and called *Red Powder*. Set this aside to refine further into *Bright Window Dust Great Elixir*. The sediment that sinks to the bottom is *White Sand Grains*—refine it into silver. Reserve this silver for later use in forging the *Hundun* vessel.

**Twelve-Fold Transformation into Bright Window Dust**
Place the *Red Powder* skimmed from the water’s surface into a sand container, press it firmly into place, and seal the rim with a paste of vinegar and clamshell powder. Set the container on an iron tripod and apply four taels of mature fire at dawn and dusk, alternating the heat for one hundred and twenty days to form *Bright Window Dust*. Once the fire and days are complete, remove the fire, take out the container, and open it—the *Red Powder* will have become light and pure, like the dust that drifts through a window’s crack, exceedingly fine. Use this *Bright Window Dust* to nurture cinnabar and refine the *Great Elixir*.

**Thirteen-Fold Transformation into the Great Elixir**
To nurture the *Great Elixir*, choose a secluded place, free from the sounds of chickens and dogs, and unseen by women. Take half of the *Bright Window Dust* and place it into a sand container, then add six taels of cinnabar in ten solid pieces—if the cinnabar is too large, it will not embed properly within the *Bright Window Dust*. Cover it with the remaining half of the *Bright Window Dust*. Seal the container tightly with a paste of vinegar and red halloysite. Place it in the furnace atop an iron tripod, applying four taels of peak fire at dawn and dusk, and nurture it for three hundred days to form the *Great Elixir*. Open the container to inspect: remove the *Bright Window Dust* and store it in a clean vessel, then take the cinnabar to refine *Purple River Chariot*. Of the six taels of nurtured cinnabar, set aside four taels for further refinement into the *Great Elixir*, while the remaining two taels may be ground and used as needed.

If a person has died within seven days and their soul has not yet dispersed, with a faint warmth lingering at the heart, administer half a *qian* of cinnabar with well-drawn morning water, and the person will revive at once. If the soul has already dispersed, the cinnabar will preserve the body for a thousand years without decay. For those who may ingest it, grind the cinnabar finely, mix it with paper mulberry juice, and form into pills the size of *wu* seeds. Facing north, swallow one pill with well-drawn morning water—this will cure all ailments, prevent contagion, and over time, turn the viscera golden, prolonging life beyond its natural span and warding off all peril. This cinnabar may be used to rescue those in dire straits. Half a *qian* of cinnabar can transmute one *jin* of mercury into silver. Do not use it lightly—be cautious and vigilant.

**Fourteen-Fold Transformation into Purple River Chariot**
Grind four taels of cinnabar finely, mix it with four taels of realgar and two taels of raw mercury, and grind them together until they resemble peach-blossom powder. Place the mixture into a sand container and seal the rim with a paste of vinegar and red halloysite. Set it in the furnace atop an iron tripod, applying four taels of peak fire at dawn and dusk for sixty days. Upon opening, the medicine will have become *Purple River Chariot*. A portion the size of an ear scoop can transmute one tael of mercury, turning it yellow.

**Fifteen-Fold Transformation into Yellow Chariot**
Take the *White Sprouts* previously sifted from the *Red Powder* and refine half a *jin* of silver into the *Hundun* vessel. If the silver is insufficient, supplement it with refined silver from other transformations.

**Hundun Crucible**
Large sand container.

Take half of the *bright dust* and place it at the bottom of the *Hundun*. Grind the *Purple River Chariot* further, add four taels of orpiment, and grind them together finely. Place this into the *bright dust*, then cover it with the remaining *bright dust*. Seal the rim of the *Hundun* with a paste of vinegar and red halloysite. Encase it in a larger sand container, lining the bottom with *White Tiger Stone* and covering the *Hundun* entirely. Seal the rim of the sand container with the same paste. Set it in the furnace atop an iron tripod, applying four taels of peak fire at dawn and dusk for forty-nine days. For this *Yellow Chariot*, use a portion the size of an ear scoop to transmute one tael of mercury: place the mercury in a *Jian* cup, sprinkle the *Yellow Chariot* over it, and heat gently over a slow fire until it becomes yellow gold. (*White Tiger Stone* is chalk.)

**Sixteen-Fold Transformation into Purple Gold Powder**
Take sixteen taels of gold transmuted from mercury using the *Yellow Chariot* and forge a *Hundun*. Take sixteen taels of *Yellow Chariot*—or ten taels, if preferred—reserving the remainder to aid the world, relieve poverty, and alleviate suffering. Grind it finely and place it into the gold *Hundun*, sealing the rim with a paste of vinegar and red halloysite. Encase it in a sand container, lining half with *White Tiger Stone*, placing the *Hundun* at the center, and covering it entirely with more *White Tiger Stone*. Seal the rim of the sand container with the same paste. Set it in the furnace, applying four taels of peak fire at dawn and dusk for forty-nine days. When the fire is complete, open the *Hundun* to find it transformed into *Purple Gold Powder*. This powder can transmute the five metals into purple gold; from this point onward, guard against reckless use.

**Method for Transmuting the Great Elixir**
Prepare all prior materials, then select a renowned mountain and auspicious site, a place sheltered from wind and gathering qi, ensuring a perimeter of three hundred paces free of lingering yin or stale energies. Use an ancient sword and an ancient mirror to construct a three-tiered altar, three feet and six inches in height, spanning one *zhang* in diameter, and cover it with a roof. Beneath the altar’s center, bury twenty-four taels of cinnabar to stabilize it. Atop the altar, place a *ding* vessel, and within it, a *spirit chamber*. First, make offerings and vows to the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, all perfected immortals of antiquity, the deities of the local pantheon, and the mountain spirits and earth gods. On the day of elixir refinement, ensure no yin spirits steal the elixir’s qi.

**Elixir Platform Formula**
Take the previous gold *Hundun* and add sixteen more taels of gold, totaling thirty-two taels, forging it to the same size and thickness as before. Place the *Purple Gold Powder* into the *Hundun* and seal it with a paste of vinegar and red halloysite. Encase it in a large sand container, which must be fired separately. Line half of the container with *White Tiger Stone*, place the *Hundun* at the center, and cover it entirely with more *White Tiger Stone*. Seal the container with the same paste, set it in the furnace atop an iron tripod, and apply four taels of peak fire at dawn and dusk for ten full months. Open the furnace, remove the sand container, and inspect the *Hundun*: the elixir will have formed into one of five grades, according to the practitioner’s merit and cultivation.

An alternate method: begin on the winter solstice and retrieve the elixir on the following winter solstice.

**First Grade: Dragon-Tiger Great Return Elixir**
This elixir forms at the top of the *Hundun*, resembling purple gold. Those with inner elixir cultivation who consume it will transmute their flesh and bones, ascending as celestial immortals. Those without inner elixir cultivation will become earthbound immortals.

**Second Grade: Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir**
This elixir forms along the sides of the *Hundun*, its color like fine jade. Its effects are as described above.

**Third Grade: Golden Liquid Lesser Return Elixir**
This elixir forms along the sides of the *Hundun*, resembling purple gold. Those with inner elixir cultivation who consume it will become flying immortals. Those without will attain longevity and immortality.

**Fourth Grade: Purple Roaming Elixir**
This elixir forms along the sides of the elixir vessel, its color purple. Those with inner elixir cultivation who consume it may attain immortality. Those without will enjoy prolonged life and enduring vision.

**Fifth Grade: Purple Gold Elixir**
This elixir forms at the bottom of the *Hundun*, its color purple gold. Those with inner elixir cultivation who consume it may attain immortality. Those without will enjoy prolonged life and enduring vision.

After refinement, observe which grade of elixir has formed, as this depends on the practitioner’s merit. Grind the elixir finely, mix it with paper mulberry juice, and form pills the size of *tong* seeds, totaling forty-nine. The remaining elixir can transmute tiles and pebbles into supreme treasures, to be reserved for aiding the world, relieving poverty, and alleviating suffering—not for personal enrichment or reckless use. The Celestial Court has strict prohibitions; exercise utmost caution.

Place the forty-nine elixir pills into a pouch of crimson silk, store it in the previous gold *Hundun*, and submerge it in the *Elixir Well* for forty-nine days. Guard it day and night without leaving, maintaining utmost sincerity. When the time is complete, retrieve the pouch, open it at the well, and first offer twenty-five pills to renowned mountains, great rivers, deep springs, and secluded caves, giving thanks to the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, all perfected immortals of antiquity, the divine officials and generals of one’s own talismanic registers, and the local deities, mountain spirits, and earth gods. Then, at dawn, face north and swallow one pill with water from the *Elixir Well*. After consumption, await the manifestation of merit; when the *Black Jade Talisman* summons, ascend in broad daylight, benefiting both oneself and one’s kin. This elixir is not of the mortal realm; guard it in secrecy.

**Refinement of the Sixteen-Fold Golden Elixir Complete**
Take the sixteen taels of *Mother* (gold), carve it into sixteen blocks, and hammer them thoroughly to remove any sharp edges. Gather an unspecified quantity of mulberry wood, dry it in the sun, and burn it to produce about one *dou* of ash. Sift the ash and steep it in boiling water to yield about one *dou* of liquid, which should be stored in a clean vessel. Cleanse *Drynaria* (also called *Earth Monkey Ginger*) by removing its leaves and skin.

**Thousand-Year Moisture** (also called *Earth Centipede*), wash clean of soil and remove moisture veins; weigh together with leaves and roots. Take two herbs, each weighing two *jin*, place in a stone mortar, and pound thoroughly. Extract the juice using new cloth, then dry and pound again. Repeat this process eight or nine times to obtain about one *dou* of juice. If less than one *dou* is yielded, use the previous ash liquid to knead and pound further, then store in a clean vessel.

Use a sand pot capable of holding three *sheng* of water. Place the sand pot atop an iron tripod, pour in the ash liquid and medicinal juice until six or seven parts full. Take the *Mother* (gold), place it in a small bamboo basket, and suspend it within the sand pot. Heat over charcoal fire, keeping the liquid at a constant boil without overflowing. Frequently immerse and baste the *Mother* in the ash-medicine liquid, continuing this process for one *fu* period. If the ash-medicine liquid diminishes, add more by steeping the previous ash sieve in boiling water to extract fresh liquid, then combine and continue boiling for another *fu* period.

Once boiling is complete, remove the bamboo basket and take out the *Mother*. Wipe each block clean with a dry cloth to remove moisture and residue, then place in a sand container. Use a large container from Xinzhou, capable of holding the sixteen blocks of *Mother* arranged at the bottom. Seal the container’s mouth with clam powder mixed with vinegar. If clam powder is unavailable, red halloysite is even better. Nurture it in a sealed state for one *fu* period, applying four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours.

The next day, open the container and pour four *liang* of mercury onto the *Mother*, then reseal as before. Place the container atop a water cauldron, positioning it as described below.

**Furnace Design**
Construct the furnace from clay or fired pottery, standing two *chi* and two *cun* tall with a diameter of one *chi* and two *cun*. The top should have two openings the size of a broken coin, and the bottom three openings the size of small copper coins.

**Water Cauldron Design**
Use a ceramic cauldron capable of holding three *sheng* of water, ensuring its mouth matches the base of the container. Fill the cauldron with boiling water to six or seven parts full each time.

**Fire Nurturing Method**
Use paper-money ash in the furnace. Once assembled, nurture the fire as prescribed. Apply four *liang* of fire in three pieces atop the container, allowing it to glow red without extinguishing, then cover with ash. Replace the fire at *mao* and *you* hours. After seven days, when the fire is sufficient, cool the furnace, open the container, and observe the mercury transformed into fish-scale patterns, resembling frost—four *liang* in total.

Add another four *liang* of mercury, reseal as before, and place in the furnace with water replenished. Seal the water cauldron’s mouth and apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours for seven days. Cool the furnace, open the container, and find the mercury dried like jade canine teeth—eight *liang* in total.

Pour another four *liang* of mercury and repeat the process. After seven days, the mercury will dry like horse-teeth quartz—twelve *liang* in total. Repeat once more, and after seven days, the mercury will dry like jade trees in a jeweled forest—sixteen *liang* in total. Add another four *liang* of mercury and repeat the process. After seven days, the mercury will dry into *Yellow Sprouts*—twenty *liang* in total.

Place the container atop the water cauldron, reseal, and nurture with fire for seven days without counting the fire’s weight. Open the container, remove the *Yellow Sprouts*, and refine them into the Great Elixir. If preservation is desired, retain them; if not, melt them as before without loss of weight.

**Nine-Fold Sprout Roasting Method**
Take two *qian* each of nitre, saltpetre, alum, and table salt, grind into powder, and set aside. Place the *Yellow Sprouts* in a sand pot, then cover with the four powders. Set the pot over a fire, gently roasting to prevent the medicine from boiling over. If it surges, sprinkle soapberry water to suppress it. Once boiling subsides, cover the pot with a *Jian* bowl, seal the edges with damp paper, and wait until the sound within ceases. Remove the bowl, discard the four-powder residue, and retrieve the *Yellow Sprouts*, now bathed and transformed into red powder.

**Ten-Fold Bathing Method**
*Violet Robe and Golden Belt, radiant in hue,*
*Seal the vessel’s mouth, guard the secret true.*
*With vigilant aid, the process aligns,*
*Steep with cinnabar in water’s designs.*

If *Aconite* (or *World-Treasure*) is unavailable, omit it. Use *Bletilla*, *Ampelopsis*, *Eucommia*, *Stephania*, and *Zanthoxylum* (sealed-mouth varieties). Take two *qian* each of the seven ingredients, chop into hemp-seed size, and boil in flowing water in a sand pot. Wrap the *Yellow Sprouts* in new cloth, suspend within, and place atop an iron tripod. Boil for one *shi* period, replenishing water as it evaporates. Once done, remove, dry the cloth, and the *Yellow Sprouts* will transform into red powder Great Elixir. If refinement into *World-Treasure* is desired, melt the *Yellow Sprouts*. At this stage, utmost caution and strict discipline are required.

**Eleven-Fold Red Powder Transformation**
Grind the *Yellow Sprouts* finely, place in a sand container, and seal the mouth with clam powder mixed with vinegar. Set the container atop an iron tripod, place in the furnace, and nurture without the water cauldron. Apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours for one hundred twenty days. Remove the fire, open the container, and find all transformed into red powder. Grind the powder finely, fill a clean basin with water to eight or nine parts full, and pour in the red powder. Skim the light, floating particles with paper, dry in sunlight—this is the *Red Powder*, reserved for refining into *Window Dust* Great Elixir. The sediment at the bottom is *White Sand*, which can be smelted into silver. Retain the silver for later use in forging *Hundun*.

**Twelve-Fold Window Dust Transformation**
Take the red powder skimmed from the water’s surface, place in a sand container, press firmly, and seal the mouth with clam powder mixed with vinegar.

Place upon an iron tripod stand, apply four *liang* of mature fire at *mao* and *you* hours in alternation, and nurture for one hundred twenty days to form *Window Dust*. Once the fire days are complete, remove the fire, take out the container, and open to inspect—the red powder, light and clear, resembles *Window Dust*, as fine as the flying dust seen through a window’s crack. Use the *Window Dust* to nurture cinnabar into the Great Elixir.

**Thirteen-Fold Great Elixir Method**
To nurture the Great Elixir, one must choose a secluded and quiet place, where neither crowing of roosters nor barking of dogs is heard, nor the sight of women seen—only then may it be undertaken. Take half of the *Window Dust* and place it into a sand container, then add six *liang* of cinnabar in solid lumps, totaling ten pieces. If the cinnabar lumps are too large, they will be difficult to embed within the *Window Dust*. Cover with the remaining half of *Window Dust*. Seal the container tightly, using red halloysite mixed with vinegar to secure the mouth’s seam. Place within the furnace upon an iron tripod stand, apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours at the crown, and nurture for three hundred days to form the Great Elixir. Remove the container, open to inspect, and collect the *Window Dust* into a clean vessel. Take the nurtured cinnabar to refine into *Purple River Chariot*. Of the six *liang* of nurtured cinnabar, set aside four *liang* for further refinement into the Great Elixir, while the remaining two *liang* may be ground and used gradually.

If a person has died for seven days and their ethereal and corporeal souls have not yet dispersed, with a faint warmth remaining at the heart, take half a *qian* of cinnabar and administer it with well-flower water into the mouth—the person will revive at once. If the souls have already dispersed, the cinnabar, once ingested, will preserve the corpse for a thousand years without decay. For those who may consume it, grind the cinnabar finely, mix with paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds, and swallow one pill while facing north with well-flower water. This will cure all ailments, prevent contagion, and over time, turn the viscera and bowels golden, prolonging life beyond the appointed term, forever free from peril. This cinnabar may be used to rescue those in dire straits. Half a *qian* of cinnabar can transmute one *jin* of mercury into silver. Do not use it lightly—heed this warning well.

**Fourteen-Fold Purple River Chariot Method**
Grind four *liang* of cinnabar finely, add four *liang* of realgar, and two *liang* of raw mercury, then grind together until resembling peach-blossom powder. Place into a sand container and seal the seam with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Set within the furnace upon an iron tripod stand, apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours at the crown, and nurture for sixty days. Remove and open to inspect—the medicine will have transformed into *Purple River Chariot*. Using a quantity the size of a scoop, it can transmute one *liang* of mercury, turning its color to yellow.

**Fifteen-Fold Yellow Chariot Method**
Take the white sprouts sifted from the previous red powder and the half-*jin* of refined silver to forge *Hundun*. If the silver is insufficient for other transmutations, add more as needed.

**Hundun Crucible**
Large sand container.

Take half of the *mingfen* and place it at the bottom of the *Hundun*. Grind the *Purple River Chariot* further, add four *liang* of orpiment, and grind finely together before placing into the *mingfen*. Cover the top with the remaining *mingfen*. Seal the seam of the *Hundun* with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Additionally, use a large sand container, lining it with *White Tiger Stone* to cover, and place the *Hundun* at its center. Seal the seam of the sand container with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Set within the furnace upon an iron tripod stand, apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours at the crown, and nurture for forty-nine days. For this *Yellow Chariot*, use a quantity the size of a scoop to treat one *liang* of mercury. Place the mercury in a *jianzhan* vessel, sprinkle the *Yellow Chariot* over it, and heat gently over a slow fire until it transforms into yellow gold. *White Tiger Stone* is white chalk.

**Sixteen-Fold Purple Gold Powder Method**
Take sixteen *liang* of gold transmuted from mercury using the *Yellow Chariot* to forge a *Hundun*. Take sixteen *liang*—or ten *liang*—of the *Yellow Chariot*, reserving the remainder to relieve the suffering of the poor and aid the world. Grind finely and place into the gold *Hundun*, then seal the seam with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Use a sand container, filling half with *White Tiger Stone*, place the *Hundun* at its center, and cover completely with *White Tiger Stone*. Seal the seam of the sand container with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Set within the furnace, apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours, and nurture for forty-nine days. When the fire is complete, open the *Hundun* to inspect—it will have transformed into *Purple Gold Powder*. This powder can transmute the Five Metals into purple gold; at this stage, one must strictly avoid reckless use.

**Method for Transmuting the Great Elixir**
Prepare all prior materials, select a renowned mountain, and choose an auspicious site where *qi* gathers and wind is sheltered, ensuring a perimeter of three hundred paces free from lingering yin or stale *qi*. Use an ancient sword and an ancient mirror, construct a three-tiered altar three *chi* and six *cun* high, with a base one *zhang* in diameter, and cover it with a roof. Bury twenty-four *liang* of cinnabar beneath the altar’s center to stabilize it. The altar shall have a *chen* (altar platform), upon which the crucible is placed, and within the crucible, a *Divine Chamber* is installed. First, make offerings and vows to the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, all perfected immortals who have attained the Dao, the deities of the local pantheon, and the mountain spirits and earth gods. On the day of elixir refinement, ensure no yin spirits steal the elixir’s *qi*.

**Elixir Platform Formula**
Take the previous gold *Hundun* and add sixteen *liang* more of gold, totaling thirty-two *liang*, forging it to the same size and thickness as before. Place the *Purple Gold Powder* into the *Hundun*, seal with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, and place into a large sand container. This sand container must be fired separately. First, line half of the sand container with *White Tiger Stone*, then place the *Hundun* within, covering it completely with *White Tiger Stone*. Seal the container firmly with red halloysite mixed with vinegar. Set within the furnace upon an iron tripod stand, apply four *liang* of fire at *mao* and *you* hours, and nurture for a full ten months. Open the furnace, remove the sand container, and inspect the *Hundun*—the medicine will have formed into five grades, corresponding to the practitioner’s merit and cultivation.

**One Method:** Begin on the Winter Solstice and retrieve the elixir on the following Winter Solstice.

**First Grade:** Named *Dragon-Tiger Great Return Elixir*. This elixir forms at the top of the *Hundun*, resembling purple gold. Those with internal elixir cultivation who consume it will transmute their flesh and bones, ascending as celestial immortals. Those without internal elixir cultivation will become earthbound immortals.

**Second Grade:** Named *Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir*. It forms along the four sides of the *Hundun*, its color like fine jade. Its effects are as described above.

**Third Grade:** Named *Golden Liquid Lesser Return Elixir*. This elixir forms along the four sides of the *Hundun*, resembling purple gold. Those with internal elixir cultivation who consume it will transmute into flying immortals. Those without will attain longevity and immortality.

**Fourth Grade:** Named *Purple Roaming Elixir*. This elixir forms along the four sides of the elixir crucible, its color purple. Those with internal elixir cultivation who consume it may attain immortality. Those without will enjoy prolonged life and enduring vision.

**Fifth Grade:** Named *Purple Gold Elixir*. This elixir forms solely at the bottom of the *Hundun*, its color purple gold. Those with internal elixir cultivation who consume it may attain immortality. Those without will enjoy prolonged life and enduring vision.

Upon completion of refinement, observe which grade of cinnabar elixir has formed, as this corresponds to the practitioner’s merit and cultivation. Grind the elixir finely according to its quantity, mix with paper mulberry juice, and form into pills the size of *tong* seeds, totaling forty-nine. The remaining elixir can transmute tiles and pebbles into supreme treasures, to be reserved for relieving the suffering of the poor and aiding the world—never for personal enrichment or reckless use. The Celestial Court has decreed strict prohibitions; one must exercise utmost caution.

Store the forty-nine elixir pills in a pouch made of crimson silk, place it within the previous gold *Hundun*, and deposit it into the *Elixir Well*. For forty-nine days, one must not leave the *Elixir Well* even momentarily, guarding it with utmost sincerity. When the time is complete, retrieve the crimson silk pouch from the *Elixir Well*. First, take twenty-five pills and cast them into renowned mountains, great rivers, deep springs, and secluded caves to offer thanks to the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, all perfected immortals who have attained the Dao, the divine officials and marshals recorded in one’s talismanic registers, and the local deities, mountain spirits, and earth gods. Then, at dawn, face north and swallow one pill with water from the *Elixir Well*. After consumption, await the manifestation of merit and cultivation. When the *Black Jade Talisman* summons, one may ascend in broad daylight, benefiting both oneself and one’s kin. This elixir is not of the mortal realm; it must be kept secret.

**Sixteen-Fold Golden Elixir of Qi Convergence**—thus concluded.
