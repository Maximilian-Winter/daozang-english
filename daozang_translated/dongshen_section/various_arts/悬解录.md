**The Record of Suspended Doubts with Preface**

**Scripture Title:** *The Record of Suspended Doubts*. The original text does not specify its author. According to the author’s preface, it likely dates to the ninth year of Dazhong in the late Tang dynasty. Its content largely aligns with *The Record of Yanmen’s Subtle Resolutions*, but includes additional entries on spring-end remedies and the character "bai" for "qi." The base text is from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, under the category of "Miscellaneous Arts" in the *Dongshen* section. Collated with *The Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll 64.

**The Record of Suspended Doubts with Preface**

In my youth, I suffered from chronic illness and devoted myself to self-cultivation, even pursuing alchemical elixirs and mineral remedies with diligence. I observed that many of my contemporaries, driven by enthusiasm, spared no expense in constructing furnaces and crucibles, claiming that the "River Chariot" could be swiftly refined to transmute earth and stone, or that "golden sand" could instantly transform to strengthen sinews and bones. Yet, time and again, some were harmed by these very medicines, their conditions beyond medical remedy. Why was this so? Was it due to impure foundational principles, unclear teachings from their masters, or such a profound disconnect between beginning and end?

While perusing Daoist texts, I chanced upon the *Essential Secrets of Elixirs* as revealed by the Ninefold Sovereign of the Heavens to Liu Hong. The Sovereign admonished the vulgar practitioners, who had not even glimpsed the faintest trace of the supreme Dao yet brazenly boasted and deceived their contemporaries. All their efforts amounted to nothing more than shortcuts to self-destruction—how could one not lament this? The words of the true immortals are never false. Long had I been mired in confusion and distress over these matters; now, I have gathered the key passages and inscribed them by my seat, naming this work *The Record of Suspended Doubts*. May all doubts dissolve upon reading it. Though I have not yet attained the protection of the Golden Elixir for preserving the body, I may at least avoid the peril of poisonous elixirs harming my life—a blessing for my natural lifespan. If there are those who share my aspirations, I earnestly hope they may overcome their unenlightened state.

Written on the seventeenth day of the fifth month in the year *yihai* of the ninth year of Dazhong.

**Compilation and Discernment of Mineral Medicines with Detoxification Methods**

During the reign of Emperor An of the Han, there was a man named Liu Hong who had long studied the supreme Dao. He abandoned his official post and retreated into the mountains. Later, in the eleventh month of the first year of Yan’guang, the Ninefold Sovereign of the Heavens descended to him, moved by the pity that Daoist practitioners did not understand the true method of refining elixirs. The Sovereign expounded the fundamental principles of the supreme medicines, distinguished the schools of various elixirs, and bestowed upon Liu Hong the *Divine Pill Formula for Neutralizing Mineral Poisons*, transmitting it as follows.

The Ninefold Sovereign said to Liu Hong: "Those who study the refinement of the Golden Elixir and the Reverted Cinnabar, or consume cinnabar, sulfur, and various mineral medicines, pursue them with great effort, believing these to be the ultimate remedies. Unaware of their depth, they compete to ingest them, all seeking immortality and deathlessness. Yet they fail to realize that golden elixirs and mineral medicines each possess their own nature, harboring potent toxins within. From the time of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor to the present, not one in ten thousand Daoists who consumed them has survived—none have escaped death."

Liu Hong bowed twice and kowtowed, asking, "Why is this so?"

The Ninefold Sovereign replied: "Those who concoct golden elixirs and consume them seek longevity. Fools exhaust their strength in worldly affairs, yet still desire the supreme medicine to transmute gold and silver, adorning their mortal forms to sustain servants and concubines. The moment such a thought arises, it is an omen of certain death, and the supreme medicine will never manifest. The teachings state that medicines possess no dual abilities, nor do they serve two purposes. Moreover, they do not understand that medicines contain supreme toxicity. After refining the elixir, people only know that *yuganzi* can restrain the 'River Chariot' and magnetite can attract needles, or that sulfur can dry mercury, believing that once the golden elixir is refined, it is free of toxins. Consider the example of the ancients who refined *qiushi* (autumn mineral): *qiushi* forms from earthly frost into stone, capable of drawing forth living mercury and neutralizing mineral poisons, yet it can also strengthen them. If one consumes it, the poison will erupt midway, unstoppable, leading inevitably to death. Even if one does not die, they will soon suffer from malignant sores—this is the precursor. Though *qiushi* is said to detoxify, when it encounters cinnabar, *fenghuang* (lead frost), sulfur, and the like, it is subdued by them—how then can it detoxify? The teachings left by the ancient sages are difficult for the world to comprehend. Those who understand are true immortals; those who do not are mere mortals."

Liu Hong asked again: "Why are medicines that transmute copper and iron unfit for consumption?"

The Sovereign replied: "The methods for transmuting medicines often employ various alums, nitrates, and roasted minerals, which together form toxic compounds. Though they can dry and restrain mercury or transmute copper and iron, their firing process differs from that of supreme medicines. The toxins coalesce within, and no matter how many times they are refined or transformed, the poison never departs. It is like a person with a venomous heart—the poison resides within, not entering from without. Or like fire within wood, inherently present. The principles of transmutation also lie within, each substance inheriting its nature, form, and properties. Their methods differ, their qi mutually engendering, each harboring its own toxicity. Male and female nitrates, roasted minerals, and miscellaneous substances assist in the firing process, but if they do not adhere to the laws of heaven and earth, whether near or far, they are not formed in accordance with the celestial Dao. Thus, it is clear that the immortals of ancient times did not consume such medicines. Their potent toxicity arises from insufficient transformative power."

Liu Hong asked again: "Since transmutative medicines contain various mineral toxins, they are indeed unfit for consumption. Yet I have heard of 'crimson powder for head-transformation' and 'seven-times reverted cinnabar,' which contain no alums or roasted minerals—can these be consumed?"

The Sovereign replied: "Among a thousand or ten thousand people, not one understands how to refine these two medicines. Even if they could, they are still unfit for consumption. Why? Consider the 'crimson powder for head-transformation'—it is a powder compounded by immortals for constructing palaces. Since it contains sulfur, and mercury entering sulfur harbors great toxicity, how could it be consumed? As for the 'seven-times reverted cinnabar,' though it is calcined to subdue fire, it fundamentally lacks the four images, five phases, sinews, bones, blood, flesh, and the fullness of yin and yang qi. If consumed, it will dry the blood in the five viscera."

When a person’s blood is scant, illness follows; when blood is exhausted, death ensues.

Hong asked: "Those who refine and consume cinnabar—if the grains remain unbroken, their color unchanged, and they withstand fierce fire without alteration—what of these?"

The Sovereign replied: "All cinnabar initially congeals within sand and stone. Even the most luminous, when volatilized, yields only twelve ounces of mercury per pound, while the remaining four ounces are the dregs of mountain and marsh, laden with great toxicity. If Daoists fail to extract these dregs and instead consume them mixed together, they will obstruct the qi channels, desiccate the blood, and bring no benefit. Moreover, since ancient times, Daoists untaught by perfected immortals have mistakenly called fire-subdued cinnabar 'dead mercury,' falsely claiming that 'golden cinnabar' entering the five viscera portends immortality—how grievously mistaken! Do people not see that none who consumed it in the past escaped death? Only pure sulfur, unmingled with other medicines, can dispel accumulated cold, yet even this must not be taken in excess, for it is purely yang and lacks balanced qi. Other minor arts need not be discussed."

Hong further inquired: "Which medicines may be consumed to prolong life and preserve youth?"

The Sovereign said: "The supreme medicines refined by immortals invariably embody the solar essence and lunar spirit, taking the four qi as their form. The solar essence never departs the sun, nor the lunar spirit the moon. Likewise, the supreme medicine never strays from its origin in wood. Why? Wood bears the color of green, symbolizing mercury, and contains within it fire—fire being yang, symbolizing cinnabar. Cinnabar belongs to *li*, the southern position of fire, for fire is cinnabar, just as wood contains fire. When matched with wood and entered into the central palace of earth, earth restrains water, fire generates earth, and thus the Dao is accomplished. It is like a newborn babe growing to adulthood, then becoming father and mother, passing through successive generations while remaining fundamentally one. The root of the supreme medicine likewise does not stray into the rootless paths of the Dao. The heart is its root, the Dao its function. Through the four seasons, it receives qi and brings forth life, each serving its purpose. The Dao is born of qi and dies of qi. The supreme medicine, when consumed, does not kill because it is untainted by杂味 and free of toxicity. When smelted into vessels—whether square or round—it becomes radiantly translucent, glowing day and night. Only then is it fit for consumption. It dispels dullness, steadies the spirit, expels demonic influences, withstands cold and heat, moistens the skin, prevents beard and temples from whitening, reverses aging to youth, and shows effects within a thousand days—hence its consumption confers immortality."

Hong again asked: "How many kinds of supreme medicine are there?"

The Sovereign replied: "The true tradition has three. First is the *Divine Talisman Supreme Immortal Elixir*; second, the *White Snow Middle Immortal Elixir*; third, the *Nine Cycles Lower Immortal Elixir*. Though these three elixirs emerge from the same gate, they bear different names, each governed by the Three-One prohibitions, which must not be lightly transmitted. Why must they not be lightly transmitted? Consider the *Divine Talisman*: without the completion of the *Taiyi* and *Tianyi* palaces, it is called *White Liquid* and will never form a vessel. This is because it takes the name of the *Tianyi* palace sphere, and its Three-One must not be transmitted. *White Snow*, if not hardened into ice, if not tempered with green, and if it fails to absorb the green qi, is no different from powdered poison frost. It is like the sun without the crow or the moon without the osmanthus—devoid of spirit. Only when it congeals into solid ice and the green is tempered like a lodestone attracting a needle may its Three-One not be transmitted. *Nine Cycles* malachite, when *White Snow* has formed a mass, enters the purple palace for use. Only when it coagulates the four qi and embraces the ten thousand images to form its substance may its Three-One not be transmitted. If the supreme medicine does not receive the four qi in primordial chaos, how can it be called the *Dragon-Tiger Elixir*? Thus, we immortals perfect the mysterious transformations of heaven and earth, our light equal to that of the sun and moon. Like the *Divine Talisman* and *White Snow*, when the work of refinement is complete, the path to ascension opens. The *Nine Cycles* reverses aging to youth, restoring a complexion like a maiden’s, and bestows a lifespan equal to Mount Nan’s. The Three-One secrets must not be lightly transmitted—how could one not be cautious?"

Hong said: "The Three-One principle is profound and arcane. Who may be entrusted with its transmission?"

The Sovereign replied: "One like myself may transmit it. The Three-One is the mechanism of creation and transformation, not unique to the supreme medicine. It is also fully present within the human body. If one can cultivate the Three-One within, mother and child will not separate, spirit and qi will naturally guard each other, harmonious and radiant, luminous and clear. Have you not seen the sun at its zenith on a summer’s day? Wind and clouds do not arise, not a speck of dust stirs, the azure sky is limpid and boundless—what obstruction could there be? The same is true for humans. If one can constantly regulate the Three-One so that myriad thoughts do not arise, one merges with the azure sky’s qi, becoming inwardly and outwardly luminous, one’s emptiness and primal origin unified—then ascension is possible. Some in the world have surreptitiously heard of this Dao and claim it is 'qi consumption,' puffing their cheeks to forcefully swallow breath through nose and mouth. This will swiftly lead to their demise, just as mistakenly consuming toxic elixirs cannot be remedied. Thus, the Three-One within the body is no different from the Three-One of the supreme medicine. Even the Three-One within the body must not be casually transmitted."

Hong further asked: "If someone has already consumed cinnabar, stalactites, sulfur, or purple powder and their toxicity erupts, how may they be saved?"

The Sovereign replied: "Those already dead cannot be spoken of. For those who have yet to consume, they may still be saved—urgently persuade them. Daoists must swiftly prepare *Guardian Immortal Pills* to preserve their lives. Take, for example, the *Purple Powder for Head-Transformation*: since it does not incorporate *Congealed White Snow* as its bone—bone being yang—and lacks tempered green, it is called *Great Toxic Purple Powder*. No matter how little or how long ago one consumed it, if they eat杂物 and trigger its effects, regardless of the day or hour, if the eruption falls outside the window for medical treatment, death will come within three to five days, and no medicine can save them."

If sulfur, purple powder, refined cinnabar, or various stalactites erupt in toxicity, the *Guardian Immortal Pills* may still save them—twelve or thirteen out of ten lives preserved. For those who have consumed any mineral elixirs but have yet to experience an eruption, preemptive administration of the *Guardian Immortal Pills* is especially efficacious.

Hong further asked: "Since the Three Great Elixirs prolong life without toxicity, may one consume them before their refinement is complete?"

The Sovereign replied: "The *Divine Talisman*, *White Snow*, and *Ninefold Cyclic Transmutation*—if they have not passed through the Palace of the Great One—remain incomplete in the Four Symbols and must not be consumed. Should someone who awaits their completion suddenly feel the onset of unrest, they must urgently drink *Earth Dragon Liver Juice*, licorice decoction, and raw mung bean juice to stabilize their condition, and death will seldom follow. Why? Because these three medicines, free from杂类 interference, merely neutralize the fire-toxin and thus avert fatality. Apart from these three, even other forms of cinnabar, though they may briefly enhance one’s complexion, will endanger life if an eruption occurs."

Hong said: "May I be instructed in the method of preparing the *Guardian Immortal Pills*?"

The Sovereign replied: "The *Five-Seed Guardian Immortal Pills*—this formula is a secret of the immortals’ lineage. Yet I shall entrust it only to those of the Dao, that they may safeguard their lives. Now I will teach you in full, along with a rough outline of the Three Elixirs. You must ponder deeply and transmit this to save those yet unawakened. Do not forget my words, for I shall depart."

Hong wept and bowed repeatedly. The Lord of the Nine Heavens raised his hand in farewell and vanished into the clouds. Liu Hong then inscribed these teachings upon stone in the mountains. Later, a Daoist discovered the inscription and transcribed it, whence it spread through the world. By the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, Master Tongxuan, Zhang Guo, presented this formula to the throne. Emperor Minghuang rejoiced and kept it in the imperial archives. Tongxuan also expounded the full efficacy of the Three Elixirs, though he omitted the methods of their refinement. Here, too, I omit the superfluous.

**Formula for the Five-Seed Guardian Immortal Pills**
*Emblic myrobalan (Phyllanthus emblica)* – 5 *liang*
*Chinese raspberry (Rubus chingii)* – 5 *liang*
*Dodder seed (Cuscuta chinensis)* – 5 *liang*
*Schisandra berry (Schisandra chinensis)* – 5 *liang*
*Plantago seed (Plantago asiatica)* – 5 *liang*

Grind each of the above five seeds separately into fine powder. Take the tender stems and leaves of *Lycium chinense* harvested in the second or third month, extract two *sheng* of juice, and mix thoroughly with the powdered seeds until fully absorbed and dried. In the seventh or eighth month, gather *Nelumbo nucifera* leaves, extract one *sheng* of juice, and likewise mix with the powder until dry.

Next, take one *sheng* of apricot kernels, grind them in good wine, and extract five *sheng* of juice. Simmer this in a silver vessel until the bitterness of the apricot kernels dissipates. Add half a *sheng* of fresh *Rehmannia* juice, five *liang* of pure butter, and five *liang* of deer antler glue (roasted and ground into powder), combining all with the previous liquid. Briefly simmer, then add the five-seed powder. Stir vigorously with a willow spatula until the mixture reaches the proper consistency. With many hands, form into pills the size of *Wutong* seeds.

Take thirty pills daily with wine. Adjust the dosage as needed. Avoid pork, garlic, mustard, radishes, and the like.

After one hundred days of consumption, all toxins from mineral elixirs will be purged. The pills also enhance the flow of *qi* from golden elixirs, nourishing the five viscera, moistening flesh and blood, and expelling all poisons. Beard and temples will darken as black as lacquer, and the old shall return to youth—all by harmonizing the *yin* and *yang* of the elixirs, their natures mutually complementing one another. Guard this secret well.

Master Tongxuan composed a song in praise of the *Five-Seed Guardian Immortal Pills*:

*To reverse age and return to youth—such is the returning elixir,*
*Yet without the Guardian Immortal, this too is fraught with peril.*
*To see silvered temples turn black once more,*
*Take but thirty pills each day.*
*Like pine and bamboo, naturally unadorned,*
*The golden liquid is refined through great tempering.*
*The Five Seeds hold the essence of a thousand autumns,*
*A hundred years as boundless as ten thousand.*

The Perfected Lord of *Yin* also discoursed on the spiritual efficacy of the Three Grades of Great Elixirs, noting that even the herbal *Five-Flavor Guardian Immortal Pills* can preserve life and assist in its sustenance. Though one may not ascend as an immortal, they may yet become an earthbound transcendent, never to die. For these pills neutralize all cinnabar elixirs and resolve the toxicity of mineral stones, preventing any eruption. They further enhance the potency of spiritual elixirs, invigorating the *ying* and *wei* *qi*. This is certain beyond doubt.

The intent of the Perfected Lord was to show that if even the Five-Seed herbal pills can render one deathless, the power of the divine elixirs is all the more evident. Here, I append this as an aid to the *Guardian Immortal Pills*.

The *Record of Suspended Liberation* concludes.
