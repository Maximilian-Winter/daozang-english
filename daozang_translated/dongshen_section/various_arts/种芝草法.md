**Method for Cultivating Zhi Herbs**

The Yellow Emperor inquired: "May I dare ask about the method for cultivating zhi herbs as recorded in the stone chamber texts?"

The reply came: "Within the *Seventh Scripture on Cultivating Zhi*, Laozi states: 'Alas, you who are not yet transcendent! All know that life is joy and death is suffering, yet none understand how life arises of itself. Though a thousand guards and ten thousand medicines enter the body, they may only grant long life—extending to a thousand years, or several hundred at best—yet they cannot enable one to soar and ascend as an immortal, to pay homage to the Heavenly Sovereign.

Among tree medicines, pine resin is the finest. This tree produces *fuling* (poria) because of its rich sap, and its hanging fruits may be consumed. Among long grasses, the finest are *huangjing* (polygonatum), *tianmendong* (asparagus root), and *shanji* (thistle). These should be taken daily without fail, restoring one’s original vitality in a hundred days, yet they still cannot match the span of heaven and earth. Later generations of alchemists have embellished these teachings, leading scholars astray—I deeply lament this.

The eight minerals and nine elixirs, mica and jade nectar—though one abstains from sexual relations and meat, they cannot make the body light enough to ascend or ride the clouds. I have heard that immortals consume *ziying* (purple essence)—how could this be mere empty talk?

On the northern slopes of famous mountains, above springs of yang essence and beneath trees and stones, zhi also grows. It is said that what it receives are the essences of mountains, waters, trees, and earth. Zhi also grows upon cinnabar, gold, malachite, and realgar. Yet these zhi herbs are not encountered by those without utmost virtue to move the spirits; even if seen, they cannot be obtained and consumed.

The reason these zhi can make one an immortal on the spot is that they absorb the purest essences of these four substances, containing the harmonious qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. Their medicinal vapors and fluids coalesce to form life, and their flavor surpasses the original nature of these four substances. Now, if one merely refines these four substances and consumes them, the effect is minimal. But if one cuts them with ritual intent, places them in a crucible, and allows their essence to ascend, sweeping and consuming it, then the efficacy of a hundred herbs is not merely equaled.

The key is to obtain the pure qi of heaven and earth. Without drawing forth the refined fluids of these four substances and allowing them to ascend and transform into living matter, their potency remains a hundredfold weaker. If one places them in an upper crucible, I shall depart. Reflecting on the countless multitudes who will turn to ash and dust—how lamentable!

Now, I record the *Celestial Zhi Scripture*. Those with destined lifespans may receive this text. If one’s ancestors bore sins, one may not attain longevity, nor obtain this scripture. Hide it within a famous mountain, beneath nine layers of stone caskets. Do not transmit it recklessly—beware, beware!

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), dig a pit in the *yinshi* (northeast) sector of a tomb or dwelling, ensuring no structures stand inside or out. Seek good soil, not ash-like earth. Dig a pit three *chi* deep and three *chi* square. Take one *jin* of malachite, grind it to powder, wrap it in sheep’s wool, and pour one *sheng* of *qingxiangzi* (celosia seeds) over it. Then cover it with soil and tamp it down. After seven days, a blue-green cloud should appear. After a hundred days, zhi will sprout above, resembling seedlings.

On a *yin* or *mao* day (Tiger or Rabbit), approach from below. Hold a three-*chi* length of blue-green silk, grasp a bone knife, perform the *Yu step*, and pluck the zhi without looking back. Return and dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then grind it to powder. Consume one *daogui* (a small measure) with *jinghua* water (dew collected at dawn). Take three doses daily. By day, one will become light enough to ascend. Spirits will come to welcome you, and after a hundred days, you will ascend to heaven. The method is as enduring as heaven and earth.

On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), on the southern slope of a mountain, dig a pit eight *chi* deep and eight *chi* square. Take two *jin* of cinnabar, grind it to powder, wrap it in realgar of a red hue, crush it to remove impurities, and place the cinnabar powder within. Pour two *sheng* of *xuanshen* (figwort root) over it, cover with soil, and tamp it flat. After sixteen days, a red cloud should cover it. After eighty days, a red vapor like smoke will rise and connect with the red cloud. After a hundred days, red zhi will sprout above, resembling seedlings.

On a *si* or *wu* day (Snake or Horse), at the time of *si* or *wu*, approach from the direction of the sun. Perform the *Yu step* with an eight-*chi* length of crimson silk, and use a wooden knife to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back. Dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then prepare a *fangcun* (square-inch) measure. Take one dose daily at dawn, when the sun has risen less than one *chi* above the horizon, washing it down with *jinghua* water. By midday, the *sanshi* (three corpses), *jiuchong* (nine worms), seven illnesses, wild pulmonary disorders, abscesses, accumulations, and the hundred diseases will all transform into turbid blood and exit through the nose and mouth. Wash with *jinghua* water, and you will be able to walk upon water, untouched by flames, and cease eating and drinking, transcending the mortal world. Do not enter houses or consume meat, and a dragon chariot with a host of immortals will come to welcome you. If you wish to remain among the people, do not cultivate this zhi.

On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), on the northern slope of a western mountain, dig a pit six *chi* deep and six *chi* square. Take one *jin* of gold, refine it with fire, and place it in the pit. Pour one *jin* of *xushan hexi* (spreading hempvine), one *hu* of clear wine, and one *hu* of duckweed over it. Cover with soil and tamp it down. After six days, a white cloud will come to cover it. After sixty days, a yellow vapor like steam will rise, connecting with the white cloud. After a hundred days, yellow zhi will sprout above, resembling seedlings.

On a *shen* or *you* day (Monkey or Rooster), at the time of *shen* or *you*, approach from the direction of the sun. Perform the *Yu step* with a six-*chi* length of white silk, and use a gold knife to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back. Dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then consume three pinches of the zhi. The old will become young again, the young will bloom with radiance, white hair will turn black, and fallen teeth will regrow. Leaping and bounding upon the earth, you will be able to fly into the heavens at will, accompanied by immortal attendants and jade maidens, who will inquire about your journey and destination."

On a day in the final month of winter, at the northern slope of a mountain, dig a pit five *chi* deep and bury three *jin* of realgar within. Refine it and place it in a vessel of wrought copper, then pour two *jin* of hemp oil over it. Cover it with one *jin* of realgar powder, tamp the earth above, and after five days, a black cloud will descend to cover it. After fifty days, a purple vapor will rise, connecting with the black cloud. After a hundred days, purple zhi will sprout above, resembling seedlings. On those nights, its light will illuminate a *li* in all directions, and on overcast days, its radiance will be visible even in fine detail.

On a *ren* or *gui* day (Water days), approach from the direction of the sun. Use a horn knife, and on a *bing* or *xin* day (Fire days), employ a five-*chi* length of black silk to harvest it. Bow twice and depart without looking back.

Dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then on a *zi* or *hai* day (Rat or Pig), grind it into powder. Consume one-fifth of it at midnight on a *zi* day, facing north. When the zhi is exhausted, the old will transform into children, and women may also consume this zhi. The Celestial Overseer of Destiny and the Great Unity will dispatch immortal officials to welcome them. Their lifespan will equal that of heaven and earth, and they will be untouched by blades, unburned by fire, undrowned by water, and free from the five poisons. They will know neither hunger nor thirst.

Those who consume this and the four zhi will attain eternal life and immortality. Wherever they reside, celestial officials will provide traveling kitchens, and they may even cease eating. Conceal it in mountains and marshes. It will summon the mounts of dragons and tigers, and spirits and gods will come to pay homage, awaiting commands. Guard this secret closely.

The commentator says: From this, we see that the numbers of heaven and earth, yin and yang, can transform and give life to the myriad things—how can one say they do not exist? It is like using a yang burning-mirror to capture fire or a yin burning-mirror to gather water. Even bamboo hidden within can generate flame—how can one say there is no resonance? With a cinnabar crucible, mercury too can be stirred into essence. What thing cannot be transformed? What thing cannot be accomplished? By borrowing the transformations of things, one may produce the hidden gold casket.

Guard this secret carefully. Only those with destined bones will encounter your form. Diligently cultivate your joy and authority, and the Celestial Overseer of Destiny will erase your name from the register of death. You will ascend with heaven and earth, roaming above the Nine Heavens and traversing the Six Directions. Your spiritual powers will penetrate all, and your blessings will be boundless.

Here ends the method for cultivating zhi herbs.
