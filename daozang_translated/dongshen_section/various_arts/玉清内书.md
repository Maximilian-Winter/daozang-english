**Jade Purity Inner Scripture**

*Title:* *Jade Purity Inner Scripture*. The author is unknown, originating in the Tang dynasty. Its content is similar to works such as the *Tongyou Jue*, *Hongju Rubi Jue*, and *Huandan Zhoutu Jue*. The *Tongzhi: Yiwen Lue* records this text in two volumes, though only one remains extant. Source of the base text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.

*(Previous section missing)*

The Perfected Lord’s Instructions state: The "Yellow Sprout" refers to the Five Phases and the *jiazi* cycle. *Jia* belongs to Wood, which is the father and mother of yang. The mother pertains to the qi of the north; after the winter solstice, the first yang arises in opposition, hence the saying "the first yang arises." The sprout receives qi from its mother, thus named *jia*. *Jia* relies on Earth, and Earth emits *jia* to generate the sprout. The sprout depends on its mother, and the mother is *kun*, which is the Yellow Sprout of *gui*. In the position of the six *jia*, it is imprisoned, dies, rests, and declines, yet shares the same *jia*, perishing in *gui* at the position of extinction.

The Five Grains, Five Fruits, grasses, trees, flowers, and herbs—all things nurtured, whether born from wombs, eggs, medicines, or humans—arise from the Yellow Sprout. Yang qi moves in misty abundance; Earth is the womb, breath is qi. All things in spring and summer release and flourish as the Yellow Sprout, while in autumn and winter, they contract and mature. Each returns to its color, reverts to its original flavor, and does not alter its former appearance—this is the meaning of "returning cinnabar," a return to the origin.

If a person alters their constant nature, they die; if a thing changes its color, it decays. Thus, when a thing undergoes the movement of fire, yang qi bears and transforms it without altering its former appearance, aligning with heaven and earth in creation. The returning cinnabar receives qi and reverts to the origin. Yang qi shines and congeals by the natural Dao, hence called the Yellow Sprout.

Ordinary people do not know that the Three Luminaries of heaven and earth, the initial separation of purity and turbidity, and the myriad beings all grow from the Yellow Sprout, arising without transcending the Five Phases. The Yellow Sprout is the initial bending and stretching of the sprout. It forms through yang and is born through yin; when yin and yang unite at the moment of receiving qi, it is first chaos. After purity and turbidity separate, the Yellow Sprout emerges.

In *jia*, it is called "yellow"; in the crescent, it is called "sprout"; in extension, it is called "shoot." Thus, it is named the Yellow Sprout, the primordial harmonious qi, inseparable from the Five Phases. The Five Phases are Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth. Water moistens and descends; Fire flames upward; Metal follows transformation; Wood bends and straightens; Earth bears crops.

The instructions say: The great Dao of heaven and earth endures forever; none among the long-lived surpass the sun, moon, and stars. The Five Phases of yin and yang, day and night, arise from Earth and ultimately return to Earth, changing with the four seasons—yet this, too, has its limit. Such is the natural Dao.

For example, pine resin receives the qi of the great yang; after a thousand years, it transforms into *fuling*; after another thousand years of illumination, it becomes a *fuling* spirit; after yet another thousand years, it becomes amber; and after another thousand years, it becomes crystal. All are the essence of the sun and moon’s radiant qi, refined into essence through illumination.

Another example: toads playing in the moonlight, clams and oysters bearing pearls—all gather and receive the radiant qi of the sun and moon, forming pearls in the womb. These are congealed by the yin essence of the moon. Both substances are suitable for consumption, particularly for treating lung qi, fright and evil, and forgetfulness. Form them into pills with honey and hemp seeds, the size of sesame, and swallow three with saliva after meals. Clams and oysters can also restrain mercury.

When a person cultivates inner virtue and power, the primordial harmonious qi flows freely. Through cultivation aligned with the Dao, essence congeals into a pearl, naturally attaining longevity. The pearl resides within the Red Waters—Red Waters being blood.

For instance, birds, beasts, insects, and ants that hibernate and conceal themselves all receive the primordial harmonious qi, sustaining life not through the teachings of parents but by their own nature. Awaken, rejoice! Secure your will. Sounds harmonize, beings resonate, presence and absence interpenetrate, yin and yang embrace to fulfill the Dao. The two qi harmonize; presence and absence restrain and complete each other, thus perfecting the Dao.

The River Chariot is the master of the Five Metals and also the position of the north. Water can ferry the chariot, bearing and transporting all things in ceaseless revolution. This is yang residing in the yin position, yin containing yang essence, Metal and mercury uniting—hence called the River Chariot. It is the ancestor of primordial harmony, establishing heaven and earth, regulating yin and yang. The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born. Receiving qi is called destiny; the most numinous is humanity.

No blessing surpasses life; no misfortune surpasses death. Since one detests death and desires life, this is embodying the great Dao. Moreover, what I have annotated differs from other schools but aligns with the orthodox classics, its principles returning to the great Dao.

In discussing hexagrams, fire timing comes first; in explaining medicinal substances, yin and yang are fundamental. *Can* means "to blend"; Water, Earth, and Metal are three things united as one family, like tally and contract, their principles in accord—hence called *Cantong* ("Triple Concordance").

The instructions say: The myriad things do not arise without the sun and moon; Metal and Water do not form without Fire and Earth. Metal and Water are the origin of transformation; Fire and Earth are the Dao of yin and yang. When heaven and earth were in chaos, though silent and not yet transformed, they were ultimately the root of the myriad things. The white of Metal and the qi of Water meet within qi, resembling a chicken’s egg.

The yang burning-mirror takes fire; without the sun, it does not emit light. The Dog Rong use a fire-mirror to ignite mugwort, instantly producing flame—symbolizing the yin and yang of returning cinnabar. This occurs frequently within the Great Tang realm. Words cannot exhaust speech; speech cannot exhaust meaning.

Yet the intent of the sages—can it not be seen? Those who use common mercury to make elixirs are deluded. Those who claim cinnabar cannot preserve appearance without proper principles do not understand the Dao. They have strayed far from the truth.

Some say: Using common lead to make mercury is the origin of the numinous.

For they do not comprehend the true essence of mercury and true lead, only praising the efficacy of common lead while neglecting the subtlety of mercury—insisting that both must be combined. How can they not consider both and extol them? If common lead is used as the medicine, one strays far from the Dao. If mercury is falsely taken for the golden elixir, it is not the true method. To grasp the correct method, one must understand that water-lead and fire-lead are the foundation. Only by obtaining the original qi of lead and encountering the Five Agents can the elixir form, without losing its root.

If one awakens to the primordial transformation and its singular application, the marvelous function reaches its utmost. If external things are taken as emotion, then nature cannot unite. If mercury is substituted for quicksilver, then lead cannot be embraced; emotion and nature cannot rely on each other, and how can the Three Palaces be stabilized? If lead cannot be embraced, how can the Eight Stones achieve their marvel? Gold retains its original weight; gold does not lose its heaviness. The sun and moon maintain their usual forms; mercury does not lose its measure. Thus, the sun and gold share the same original weight.

My life resides in lead, not in heaven. When the returning elixir is perfected, gold endures for myriad years. Lead and mercury are originally one body, not two. Therefore, it is said: "Heavenly lead, do not destroy my lead, so that my life may be preserved. Do not break my chariot, that it may carry me home." Lead is that which naturally arises within cinnabar. The chariot is the liquid drawn forth from cinnabar.

When gold is moved by fire, it is called the returning elixir. The essence of gold, the yellow sprout, restrains water so it does not overflow. The power of the essence of gold is the mysterious water. The essence of gold and the yellow sprout are of the same name—naturally arising lead. Water is the liquid drawn forth from cinnabar.

To use lead or not to use lead—without it, one cannot attain longevity. Those who use lead rely on the lead naturally contained within cinnabar. Those who do not use lead refer to the mother of common silver—common lead. If the lead is not true, its mercury is difficult to embrace. If the lead is true, it does not lose its household minister. If the lead is not true, it is common lead. If the lead is true, it is cinnabar-lead.

Better to refine the gold within lead—this is the gold that naturally arises within cinnabar. Do not refine the treasure within gold—this is mercury. The sages provide clear analogies to instruct later learners.

What is the crucible? It is the cinnabar itself, used as the vessel. What is the medicine? It is the mercury that naturally flows from cinnabar.

Distinguishing male and female, the Three-in-One, the discourse on black and white—these parallel the *Great Change* and the *Uniting Them*. Fire-lead is cinnabar, moved by the sun and moon, naturally producing mercury—this is fire-lead. Water-silver is another name for mercury, the yang qi of cinnabar not yet fully realized, drawn out as water-silver. Within cinnabar, when the essence of the husk is sufficient, it spontaneously generates and is called male. Male and female unite, yin and yang naturally harmonize, their bond transcending difference.

The golden elixir originates from one thing yet is not two things. When yang qi enters and moves, it is called the Way of the Three-in-One. White is the essence of gold; black is the foundation of water. They return to one yet are not two. The sages borrowed the hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes* as metaphors, moving them to form the elixir. Subduing and mastering all arise from the parents; movement does not transcend the Five Agents. Following yin and yang, one does not lose the proper time. If used in reverse, the hun and po perish, like the sun and moon eclipsing and losing their positions, failing to submit to each other.

The sages guarded their secrets, unable to speak plainly, often resorting to veiled language. From these cryptic instructions, many errors arise, leading to failure. The secrets of the golden crucible must be guarded with care. Foreign medicines and mixtures are certainly not the way.

The Dao of heaven is difficult to reveal. Some conceal it in profound images, others attach it to yin and yang, subtly explaining it among people, speaking of its wondrous principles—yet the multitude remains confused and lost. Since the time of Fuxi, those who sought the Dao and long life have been many, but those who encountered and attained it are few. They cling to their own conjectures without discernment.

Without seeking oral instructions from a master, relying only on ancient texts and analogies, one vainly toils in famous mountains, deep valleys, and secluded streams. Decayed and deluded scholars, from ancient times to the present, have never been seen to achieve immortality. Consuming the Five Grains, indulging the Six Desires, humans live in yang while ghosts dwell in yin. Yang shines while yin conceals, each obscuring the other. Unable to command ghosts and spirits or direct yin and yang, they fail to obtain the methods of transcending the world—all perish and sink into the mundane.

In cold, one dons padded robes for inner warmth; in heat, one wears light garments and drinks water. Born at the boundary of yin and yang, governed by the Five Agents, consuming things born of earth, one returns to earth at death—this is returning to the root. Without encountering the radiant qi of the sun and moon, circulating the essence and fluids, refining the Three-in-One returning elixir, how can one transcend the walking corpse and the teeming masses?

Like a stone cast into a river, unable to return, sinking and transforming—how lamentable! But if one encounters the inner and outer golden elixirs, consumes them, and circulates them through the body, preserving an extraordinary appearance, one may transcend the boundary of yin and yang, escape the governance of the Five Agents, evade the ledgers of death, and command the service of ghosts and spirits.

The instructions say: The Dao has immortal transmissions, secret records, and elixir classics such as the *Dragon and Tiger*, the *Supreme Clarity*, the *Five Metals in Mutual Resemblance*, and the *Uniting Them in the Zhou Changes* in song and verse. The intent of the ancients—from the former sages to the later sages—all attained this Dao.

Yet people of the present age, deluded and foolish, fail to awaken. Those who practice cultivation and attain the Dao do not reveal their names when encountered; those who obtain it conceal it without exception. The oral instructions passed down from master to disciple, the secret methods and hidden records, the songs, verses, and hexagrams—all reveal only branches and leaves, never fully disclosing the direct path.

From ancient times to the present, those who encounter it must receive oral instructions from a master; only then do they have a share in it—otherwise, it is not true learning. Those who transmit the *Prescriptions Behind the Elbow* keep it secret in their hearts. The Dao of heaven must not be carelessly revealed; to do so is to nourish a tiger that will bite you. If entrusted to an unworthy person, calamity befalls seven generations, and one is demoted to a lowly ghost.

Few in the world possess this knowledge by fate; those who encounter and transmit it without destined affinity must seek its traces through investigation. Only those of unwavering inner conduct and destined affinity may earnestly pledge vows, invoke the hundred spirits, and face the sun, moon, and stars to receive the talismanic contract before transmission is permitted.

The practice must be unwavering, the supreme medicine singular and primordial; heaven and humanity unite with the Dao, their principles harmonizing with nature. It cannot be hastily seized or hunted down. Those who meet a master and awaken to the truth learn that the great medicine has but one gate, yet comprises three substances—water, earth, and metal—not the common water, earth, and metal of the mundane world. When obtained, it reunites the hun and po; with an unwavering heart, the Dao master naturally attains the golden elixir of inner and outer alchemy. Ingesting it confers immortality, equaling heaven and earth in longevity. The *Prescriptions Behind the Elbow* for Longevity are revealed here for later students who fail to comprehend.

**On constructing the crucible and infusing metal, and the direct talismanic use of hexagrams and clepsydra, no further details are recorded here.**

**Oral instructions for transmuting the Five Metals and refining mercury:**
The Golden Elixir, when guarded and circulated for fifteen days, kills the nature of metal; one *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury into white Dao.
When guarded for thirty days, it may be ingested in doses of two *liang*.
When guarded for forty-five days, or ninety days, or a full four seasons, half a *liang* transmutes one *jin* of mercury into white Dao, and may be ingested in doses of one and a half *liang*.
When guarded for two years, one *fen* transmutes one *jin* of mercury into white Dao, and may be ingested in doses of three *fen*.
When guarded for three years, the primordial qi is fully realized; a *daogui* measure transmutes one *jin* of mercury into white Dao, and may be ingested in doses of one *fen*.
When guarded for five years, a *daogui* measure transmutes one *jin* each of iron, mercury, the Five Metals, and various minerals into their respective treasures. Ingesting one *zhū* confers eternal life and abiding in the world. Not only humans, but chickens, dogs, birds, and livestock may ingest it without dying.

Twenty-four *zhū* make one *liang*; one *daogui* equals one *fen*.

**Oral instructions:**
According to the duration of guarding and circulating—days, months, or years—the quantity of medicine varies. Transmute mercury into gold and silver by weight, then further refine copper and arsenolite into "great silver."
For each *jin* of mercury, use two *liang* of medicinal silver.
When mercury is guarded for one year, use three *liang* to transmute one *jin* of mercury into white Dao.
When guarded for two years, use two *liang* to transmute one *jin*.
When guarded for three years, use one *liang* to transmute one *jin* into white Dao.
Further guard and circulate for one, two, or three years, adjusting the weight of medicine to transmute mercury into white Dao as above.
Continue guarding and circulating, using the head of the medicine to refine its kind, perpetuating the lineage without end.
This is the primordial transformation of the Golden Elixir, its wondrous application as mother and child reaching the ultimate.

To attain spiritual penetration and transformation, one must use native soil for the crucible, adhere to the fire phases, and follow the cycles of concealment and renewal. Thus may it become a worldly treasure and immortal emolument.

**Oral instructions:**
Take native celestial lead and common mercury in equal weights, combining them to make one *jin*.
Place them in the sealed vessel, using native soil for the outer crucible, and seal it properly. Construct a furnace, encircle it with ash, and bury the crucible within, leaving five *cun* of ash above. Apply fire to the upper portion.
Begin with five *liang*; after one *fu* period, increase to half a *jin*; after another *fu*, increase to thirteen *liang*; after another *fu*, increase to one *jin*.
Maintain this weight day and night for thirty days, then take two *liang* of medicine to transmute one *jin* of mercury into white Dao.
Use two *liang* of this silver to further transmute one *jin* of copper into "great silver."

**Oral instructions:**
Return the mercury to the sealed vessel for guarding and circulating.
Follow the protective instructions for fire weight and duration, then transmute mercury again. Mother and child follow in succession, perpetually without end.

**Oral instructions:**
When transmuting iron, the Five Metals, and various minerals, all may be refined into treasures.
Why? Because this is using the head to refine the head—it is not the medicine that originally received primordial qi.
Moreover, lacking the original father and mother, its spiritual efficacy differs, only transforming lower arts into white Dao.
Ingestion is not subject to dosage limits, for it contains toxicity.

**Method for constructing the outer crucible to refine mercury:**
**Oral instructions:**
For urgent use of the medicine, take native soil and mold it into an inner crucible and outer crucible, sealing them properly.
Maintain the same depth as before, place the golden crucible within, and seal it. Bury it in ash, leaving the top exposed for fire.
Begin with five *liang*; after one *fu* period, increase to seven *liang*; after another *fu*, increase to twelve *liang*; after another *fu*, increase to one *jin*, then maintain for eight *fu* periods.
Apply martial fire to all four sides of the crucible until it glows red, then open it after half a day. One *liang* of medicine transmutes one *jin* of mercury.
Replace the crucible and apply one *jin* of fire day and night for one year; then half a *liang* transmutes one *jin* of mercury into white Dao.
**Oral instructions:**
Replace the crucible again, apply one *jin* of fire, and guard for two years; one and a half *fen* transmute one *jin* of mercury into white Dao.
Replace the crucible and guard for three years; one *fen* transmutes one *jin*.
The crucible should be replaced yearly; the transmutation follows the same method as above, adjusting the medicine’s weight according to the duration to refine all into treasures.
However, ingestion is not recommended, for it lacks primordial qi, being merely a talismanic or clepsydra-based guarding and circulating.

**Oral instructions for refining mercury with medicine:**
When refining mercury, take mercury and medicine, grind them together, and place them in a pot.
Cover with a small amount of medicine, then seal the top with a lid, wrapping the sides with damp paper. Place it in fine ash.
Apply about half a *jin* of fire from a distance for the duration of cooking one meal, then gradually increase the fire. After half a day, burn until red-hot.
Shortly, it will harden into a mass; cease the fire, then pound it to begin melting it into a substance, thus forming a treasure.

**Oral instructions:**
When the Great Elixir has been guarded for three years and its qi is full, take it and form pills with wood honey the size of hemp seeds. Ingest according to the prescribed weight each year.

Take the freshly prepared elixir medicine, kneel and sit facing the sun, and recite: "Heavenly Perfected Ones, partake of this." Fasten one *liang* of the elixir to your left arm; thereafter, when you go out or come in, present memorials and petitions, ascend altars, and pay homage—all people will revere and look up to you. Should any harbor unintended ill intentions toward you, they will disperse of their own accord. When entering mountains or open wilderness, whether by day or night, you will encounter no harm from ferocious beasts, ghosts, demons, or evil men, for they will all prostrate themselves and hide, daring not to cause injury. Fasten it where battles rage, and five hundred attendants will encircle and protect you, shielding you from arrows, blades, or any weapon’s harm. Wherever you travel, the local spirits and deities will serve as your guards. If you possess elixir texts, talismans, or scriptures, and perform the method of liberation through the simulated corpse, you may summon the Celestial Immortals of the Five Peaks, dragon spirits, and the myriad numina, who will instantly arrive to be commanded at will. Should the people of the world suffer from illness, inscribe characters with the elixir and swallow them—they will be cured immediately.

**Inscription on the Golden Crucible:**
The Golden Crucible of the Earth Deity,
Seven *cun* in length for life and death.
The divine chamber, three *cun* bright,
Five *cun* round, two *cun* deep.
Revolving in primordial chaos,
Like the four stars of heaven and earth.
Yin and yang at two ends,
Resembling a hen’s egg in form.
Let its shape and appearance be without flaw,
With yellow and white within.
Thickness and thinness must be even,
Sealed firmly with the Six-and-One.
Guard well the Gate of Noon,
And the *Triple Concordance* will naturally align.

**Method for Crafting the Crucible and Infusing the Gold:**

The method states: For crafting the crucible and infusing the gold, take the earth beneath naturally occurring cinnabar—whether it resembles yellow wax in texture or appears dark greenish-black—and gather one or two *he* of it. Grind and sift it; if it contains grains of stone or cinnabar, varying in size like sesame seeds, or if it is yellowish-black but yields cinnabar when crushed, this earth is of great potency. After sifting, knead it into clay, ensuring it is well-worked for optimal use. Then fashion the crucible in the shape of a hen’s egg: seven *cun* in length, five *cun* in circumference. While still moist, cut it into two halves to form the upper and lower sections. Dry them in the sun. The central chamber should be three *cun* wide, tapering gradually to a depth of two *cun* at the base. Both the inner chamber and the outer shell should resemble the shape of a hen’s egg. The rims of the two halves should be crafted as male and female joints, perfectly aligned without irregularity.

Place the golden water within the vessel, dividing it evenly by proportion rather than by fixed weight. Seal it according to the method, then set it in a clay furnace as needed. Use a straight talisman, positioned one *cun* above the base of the crucible. Cover and activate it. Always bury it firmly beneath a layer of grass ash. The talisman’s operation follows the six seasonal markers.

**Method for Advancing and Retreating the Fire According to the Six Seasonal Markers:**
- **First day of the first month, initial marker:** Ignite one *liang* of fire for thirty hours.
- **By the second day and a half:** Increase to two *liang* for sixty hours.
- **Sixth day, second marker:** Begin with three *liang* for thirty hours, increasing to four *liang* for sixty hours.
- **Eleventh day, third marker:** Begin with five *liang* for thirty hours, increasing to six *liang* for sixty hours.
- **Sixteenth day, fourth marker:** Begin again with six *liang* for thirty hours, retreating to five *liang* for sixty hours.
- **Twenty-first day, fifth marker:** Retreat to four *liang* for thirty hours, then to three *liang* for sixty hours.
- **Twenty-sixth day, sixth marker:** Retreat to two *liang* for thirty hours, then to one *liang* for sixty hours.

This six-marker talisman, with its advancing and retreating *yao* symbols, follows the monthly cycle, repeating endlessly.

- **Second month, initial marker:** Begin with two *liang* for thirty hours, increasing to three *liang*.
- For each subsequent month, when replacing the crucible at the month’s start, begin with one *liang* and proceed accordingly.
- By the ninth month’s initial marker, use nine *liang*.
- From one to nine, the Metal Tiger exhales its essence: thirty hours at nine *liang*, increasing to ten *liang* for sixty hours.
- The talisman’s advance and retreat must align with the method, clearly following the water clock’s divisions.

When the fire is at its peak—symbolizing the fourth month, the height of yang—its advance and retreat must be precise, for yin and yang contend in their measures. When replacing the crucible, it is the Earth’s reign in the Metal’s domain, where the three substances all perish, for the Metal and Earth’s fundamental *qi* resonate with one another.

When the talisman retreats—symbolizing the fifth month, when yin *qi* begins to act—one yin arises at the ninth position, and the "exalted dragon meets with regret." The talisman’s movement continues until the ninth crucible.

- **After the ninth month, initial marker:** Use nine *liang* for thirty hours, increasing by one *liang* for sixty hours.
- By the end of the third marker, use fourteen *liang*—the peak of yang.
- At the fifth marker, yin arises, retreating to twelve *liang* for thirty hours, then to eleven *liang*.
- By the sixth marker, retreat to ten *liang* for thirty hours, then to nine *liang* for sixty hours.

After the tenth month, regardless of the year or month, always follow the ninth month’s initial marker: begin with nine *liang* for thirty hours, increasing by one *liang* for sixty hours. By the third marker, use fourteen *liang*, then retreat to nine *liang* by the sixth marker for sixty hours. Proceed in sequence with the talisman’s advance and retreat, clearly following the water clock’s divisions. Repeat day and night, completing the method after nine cycles.

**Method:**
From the first month’s initial marker, ignite twenty-four *zhu* of fire to generate one *yao*, symbolizing the twenty-four solar terms. Maintain this until the second day and a half, then add one *yao*, completing one marker by the fifth day. Continue increasing the fire by *yao* each month, with six markers per month. Always note that the period from the end of the third marker’s sixty hours to the beginning of the fourth marker’s thirty hours is the phase for martial fire. The fire’s weight in *liang* advances and retreats day and night, requiring the addition of well-charred coals. Keep the fire’s surface exposed to gauge the correct weight. After completing the nine-and-a-half-month cycle of the talisman, always follow the ninth month’s fire-marker *yao* method for advancing and retreating *liang*, regardless of the year or month.

**Further Method:**
The fire markers are the most difficult. Traveling through famous mountains to seek the highest teachings, one may find shared discussions and insights. Yet only Earth and Fire remain untransmitted in the world. This, recorded at my side, is the true method’s source.

**Diagram of the Talisman’s Advance and Retreat According to the Water Clock:**
The method states: When the talisman advances or retreats, one must precisely follow the water clock’s divisions, using it according to the method. The water clock’s advance and retreat are fixed by time, with a direct path for measuring expansion and contraction. Simply observe the length of day and night, dividing the twelve double-hours: *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, si, wu, wei, shen, you, xu, hai*.

- From the initial *zi* hour, observe the water’s flow until the *chou* hour to determine the required volume.
- Craft a barrel three *chi* tall, one *chi* in inner diameter. Near the base’s edge, drill a small hole and tightly insert a tube made of black feather quills, sealing the gaps with wax. Fill it with water and let it drip freely. When empty, refill it and continue dripping. Observe how many barrels correspond to one double-hour, thereby determining the water volume for each hour.
- Divide the day and night into twelve double-hours, estimating the barrel count for each. This method differs from the standard water clock’s weight measurement. If the water flow varies, adjust for the length of day and night. With careful attention, it will be infallible.

**Secret Method of the Hidden Workings from the Hand Mirror of the Primordial Sovereign**
The method states: The two *qi* of Heaven and Earth interact, the sun and moon alternately illuminate, forming the natural cyclical elixir.

**Celestial Immortals of the Upper Realm** guard and gather the harvest. This is not something mundane scholars may encounter—only immortals then take it as their own. The Three Sovereigns revered the supreme Dao to cultivate life, employing the *Straight Talisman* to move the *qi* for three years, mirroring the natural circulation of *qi*. The fire phases follow the seasonal nodes, aligning with Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. The movement of fire phases and their weights must be received through the true scripture and oral transmission from a master. What is spoken is not recorded; without receiving instruction from a master, the ingredients will be disordered and mixed, and one will never grasp the principle.

The sages observed the gate of celestial talismans and guarded the One. By obtaining the mutual restraint of the original father and mother, the Great Elixir is surely achieved. Thus, the Dao of yin-yang transformation grants spiritual freedom and self-mastery, returning to its original color.

The method states: The *Straight Talisman* serves as an analogy. For example, take ten: in the first month, *Jianzi*, yang *qi* begins to arise, modeled after the summer solstice. On the day before the solstice, at the hour of the cock’s crow, the first yin is born, and yin *qi* takes charge. This is the advance and retreat of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, governing the twelve months of the year’s generation and completion. Thus, the moon has six *zhi-fu* phases, with generation, completion, concealment, and the waxing and waning of the Five Agents. Their interactions and temporal forms are all contained within the *nei-shen*.

Therefore, it is said: In the fifteen days before the fire and wood phases, the white moon’s three phases see extreme yang in charge. After this, yang retreats and yin arises—this is the nine-six yin water. In the fifteen days after, the black moon’s three phases see extreme yin in charge. The cycle repeats endlessly. Thus, the seven, eight, nine, and six paths naturally align, and the thirty-day cycle concludes with metal and water.

This analogy establishes the moon’s phases for day and night, using fire to conceal and activate, mirroring the yin-yang seasonal nodes of a year. The *zhi-fu* governs day and night—this is the pivot of Heaven and Earth held in the hand, called the "method of world-transcendence." Spiritual transformations are profound beyond profundity.

When the fire is first applied, it corresponds to the eleventh month, when yang begins its charge. The method states: In the first crucible’s first initial phase, the first *yao* of fire arises. The *zhi-fu* symbolizes the eleventh month, *Jianzi*, when yang *qi* takes charge. *Chujiu*: "The hidden dragon does not act." The first *yao* governs day and night for two and a half days—thirty hours. Increasing to two *yao*, it reaches five days—one phase of sixty hours—completing eleven days, one celestial stem. *Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai*: five cycles of sixty hours each constitute one phase. In the first phase of five days, *Jingzhen* (thunder) arrives to receive the talisman. By the eighth day, the upper quarter, the metal nature wavers between low and high, half-dead. Guarding until the fifteenth day completes one *qi*, and the metal nature is wholly extinguished. On the twentieth day, what sprouts does not grow; yang extends while yin recedes. Water does not move, and hardness and softness interact—this is the natural elixir.

On the twenty-first day, *Xun* (wind) arrives to receive the talisman. The natures of metal and water have already perished and exhausted. The two essences breathe and swallow in unison, dying together. The two woods, *Zhen* and *Xun*, gradually harmonize. Though mercury obtains Qian, it is not yet the Great Elixir. On the thirtieth day, the Dao is exhausted and returns to Kun’s origin. Receiving the talisman, the elixir forms, and the three substances vanish together into earth. Forty-five days constitute one node, and the nodes mutually resonate and circulate. At sixty days, *Mao* aligns with *Jiazhong*. When *Jia* reaches the *Mao* gate, the elm pods fall, returning to their root.

In the second month, the elm dies, and *Kui* and *Gang* contend with *Mao*. Punishment and virtue oppose each other, and day and night begin to divide. Thus, it is called the "elm-pod elixir." The method states: The sun has three illuminations, and the moon has three shifts. The union of sun and moon’s *qi* causes all things to undergo three transformations and reach their extreme, following the natural Dao of the four seasons.

The moon has 360 hours, each hour corresponding to one year’s twelve months, totaling 4,320 hours. One hour represents one year, amounting to 4,320 years—mirroring the natural cyclical elixir, where yin and yang unite and the alternation of cold and heat forms images.

The method states: Concealment and activation, yang extending and yin receding—all else follows the seasonal nodes and hexagram images of the *zhi-fu* and *qi* phases. The method is that of the Nine Crucibles. Nine crucibles span nine months. The method states: Each of the Nine Crucibles requires three divisions. Each crucible is guarded for thirty days, receiving *qi* for a full 270 days. When yin and yang are both abundant, in the tenth month, earth reigns and gives birth. Thus, it is called "mother and child shedding the womb"—a truth unknown to the world.

Water and fire overcome each other, mutually restraining and submitting, becoming father and mother anew. They do not exceed the Five Agents, concealing and forming shape. Guarding and circulating for 1,000 days, the great primordial *qi* is fulfilled. The nature returns to the north, to *Gui* water, black in color. Only then is it named the Great Cyclical Elixir.

The method states: Take the primordial *qi* of metal and water, balancing their weights to harmonize their fundamental bodies. Establish the analogy of the upper and lower quarters, with the number two-eight (sixteen) corresponding to yin and yang’s two metals. Originating from one thing, they generate the two images of *qi* phases—yellow and white, male and female—naturally dependent in nature. Yin and yang unite into one primordial two: two is fire, one is water. Excluding water and fire as medicines, there is no separate division. If there are heterogenous elements, the elixir will never form. Success does not lie in the weight or number.

The method states: Simply place metal and water into the crucible, sealing it properly according to the method. Apply the four destructive punishments and restraints. On a yang day at a yang hour, ignite the fire. Set the water clock clearly, knowing the additions and reductions without losing the metal and water within the crucible. Before separation, in primordial chaos, the *zhi-fu* moves them. Yin and yang intermingle, swallowing and transforming. The primordial *qi* clarifies and muddies, ascending and descending in mysterious yellow. Metal and water take form, resembling a chicken’s egg. The primordial *qi* is within the shell, receiving yang *qi*, containing its truth and embracing the One.

The method states: Cinnabar and golden sand, golden liquid inverted to grow sand, yellow sprouts and celestial lead, sand-mercury and lead-mercury, true yin and true yang, metal, earth, water, and fire, Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—transforming and giving birth to the dragon and tiger, the black tiger, the Western Numinous Golden Elixir, the Jade Liquid of Nine Cycles, the Great Return—all are alternate names for the cyclical elixir. These are the hidden secrets of the ancients, not to be grasped by the unenlightened.

Should one encounter the *Zhouhou Jue* or the *Cantong Qi*, their principles converge in the One and the Two—hence the name "Returning Elixir." The Returning Elixir has its reversals, and one must shun the "blood of the overturned basin." The "blood of the overturned basin" refers to inauspicious persons. Take care not to share the same mind with them, lest the celestial Dao be divulged.

When conjoining metal and placing it into the crucible, the *zhifu* governs the process. The site of elixir refinement must be guarded with vigilance, kept pure and undefiled—far from places of birth and death, wailing and weeping, desecrated temples, or unholy grounds. One must select an auspicious location, blessed with propitious terrain, to establish the altar. There, burn incense, devote oneself in reverence, and offer sacrifices to the local earth spirits, water and land deities, and all such numina. Only then may the crucible be installed, so that the hundred spirits may lend their aid, the celestial Dao harmonize, and the various immortals come to safeguard the work. Yet the heart must remain unwavering in its singular intent.

If practicing in an ordinary place, one must still be cautious of defilement and avoid carelessness in the arrangement of the furnace or the designation of the medicinal ingredients. Diagrams of their positions and the rites of offering are recorded in separate instructions.
