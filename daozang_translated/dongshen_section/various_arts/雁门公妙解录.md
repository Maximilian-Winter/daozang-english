**Preface to the *Wondrous Explanations of Yanmen Gong* and the *Wondrous Explanations* Itself**
In my youth, I harbored illness and devoted myself entirely to cultivation and self-nurturing, even to the point of diligently seeking elixirs from minerals and stones.

I have observed that in our present age, those who pursue alchemy do not spare wealth, laboring tirelessly over furnaces, claiming that the *Héchē* (河车) can be made to produce elixirs instantly, transforming soil and stone into *Jīndān* (金丹), and that *Dānshā* (丹砂) can be refined to strengthen sinews and marrow. Yet, time and again, they fall victim to the very medicines they seek, and physicians cannot save them. Why is this so?

Is it because their foundational principles are flawed? Or because their methods and teachings are unclear? Why do their results never align with their expectations, and why does this occur so frequently?

Upon examining Daoist texts, I chanced upon the *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord’s instructions to *Liú Hóng* (刘泓) regarding the essentials of elixir refinement. The Lord lamented that ordinary practitioners had yet to glimpse the slightest hint of the ultimate Dao, yet they presumptuously boasted of their proficiency, deceiving others. All their endeavors were merely swift paths to self-destruction—how could one not pity them?

The words of the true immortals are unerring. I, burdened by lingering doubts and still entangled in confusion, now extract the core teachings from this revelation and inscribe them on my study walls, naming it the *Wondrous Explanations* (妙解录). I hope that when others read it, their perplexities will be dispelled, and though they may not yet attain the *Jīnyè* (金液) for preserving life, they will at least avoid the perils of poisonous elixirs that harm the body. This would be a blessing from Heaven itself.

If there are those who share my earnest intent, I earnestly hope they will delve into what remains unclear. Written on the eighteenth day of the fifth month, in the year *Dàzhōng Jiǔ* (大中九), *Yǐhài* (乙亥), on the day *Jiāzǐ* (甲子).

**Discerning Alchemical Elixirs and Remedies Against Toxicity**

During the reign of Emperor *Āndì* (安帝) of the Han dynasty, there was a man named *Liú Hóng* (刘泓), who studied the ultimate Dao for many years and abandoned his official post to enter the mountains. Later, in the eleventh month of the *Yán Guāng* (延光) era, the *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord descended to instruct him. Moved by pity for the alchemists’ ignorance of the true methods of refining elixirs, the Lord pointed out the essential principles of the highest medicine, distinguished the various schools of alchemy, and explained the methods for neutralizing mineral toxins in *Bǎoxiān Wán* (保仙丸) formulas, passing them on to Hóng, who then recorded them for posterity.

The *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord said to *Liú Hóng* (刘泓):
*"Those who study the refinement of *Jīnyè* (金液) and *Huándān* (还丹), and who consume *Dānshā* (丹砂) and *liúhuáng* (硫黄), along with other minerals like *rǔshí* (乳石), strain to obtain them, believing that once acquired, they will have attained the supreme medicine. Yet they fail to grasp their depths and shallows, rushing to learn and ingest these elixirs, all in the hope of eternal life. They do not realize that *Jīndān* (金丹) and other mineral medicines each possess their own inherent nature, and that great toxicity lies concealed within them. Since the time of *Yáo* (羲) and *Xuān* (轩), those who consume them have not survived even one in ten thousand—there has never been one who did not perish.*

*Hóng* (泓) bowed twice and kowtowed, asking: *"Why is this so?"*

The *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord replied:
*"Ordinary people refine *Jīndān* (金丹) and consume elixirs in pursuit of longevity. The foolish among them exert themselves to acquire them, while the common folk desire to use the supreme medicine to transmute gold and silver, enriching their lifeless bodies and nourishing their servants and concubines. But once they harbor such intentions, it is a sign they are doomed to die—this is the fundamental reason why the medicine fails to manifest its efficacy. Only the alchemical teachings of the immortals possess unparalleled efficacy and dual-purpose utility.*

*Moreover, people do not know that these medicines contain profound toxicity. After refining *Jīndān* (金丹), they only recognize that *Yúgānzǐ* (余甘子) can produce the *Héchē* (河车), that magnetite can attract needles, and that *liúhuáng* (硫黄) can dry *shuǐyín* (水银), believing that once these processes are complete, the elixir is free of toxicity. However, when ancient sages refined *Qiūshí* (秋石), which forms from *dìshuāng* (地霜) and can draw out living mercury, it can also neutralize the toxicity of minerals and stones. Yet if there is any residual toxicity, it will erupt mid-process, unstoppable, leading inevitably to death. Even if they do not die, they will suffer from malignant sores—this is the initial omen. Though *Qiūshí* (秋石) is said to resolve toxicity, it is capable of subduing *Zhūshā* (朱砂), *Zǐfěn* (紫粉), *Dúshuāng* (毒霜), and *liúhuáng* (硫黄), how could it still be toxic? The teachings of the ancient sages are difficult for the world to comprehend. Only the true immortals understand them, while ordinary people do not.*

*Hóng* (泓) asked again: *"Why are medicines used for transmuting copper and iron unfit for consumption?"*

The *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord said:
*"Because the methods for transmuting metals often employ *fánshí* (矾石), *xiāoshí* (硝石), and *páoshā* (炮砂) and their ilk, which combine to form toxicity. Though they can dry mercury and transmute copper and iron, the timing and application of fire differ from those used in *Jīndān* (金丹) refinement. Green toxicity (绿毒) remains embedded within them, and even if refined a thousand or ten thousand times, the poison will never be fully expelled. It is like a poison within a person’s heart, not entering from without, or like fire hidden within wood, its origin internal. The transmuted medicines inherently contain poison within their very nature. Each follows its own color and method, with *qi* (气) passing between them, yet all retain their toxic properties. The sulfurous, mercurial, and other mineral substances—whether *xiāo* (雄), *cī* (雌), or refined with *páo* (炮)—aid one another in their fiery transformations, disregarding the laws of Heaven and Earth. Thus, they either draw near or remain distant from the true toxic nature, for they do not conform to the Dao of Heaven. Therefore, it is clear that ancient immortals never consumed these medicines, as their transmutative power is insufficient to overcome the toxicity.*

*Hóng* (泓) asked again: *"If transmuted medicines contain various impurities and toxins, they are indeed unfit for consumption. I have also heard that *Huántóu Zǐfěn* (换头紫粉) and *Qīfǎn Dānshā* (七返丹砂), when refined with *yuánfán* (元矾) and subjected to *páo* (炮), can be consumed. Is this true?"*

The *Nine Xīao* (九霄) Lord said:
*"These two medicines—even if one in a thousand or ten thousand understands them—are still unfit for consumption. Why? Even if they can be refined, *Huántóu Zǐfěn* (换头紫粉) is a substance cultivated by immortals for use in palaces. It contains *liúhuáng* (硫黄), and when *shuǐyín* (水银) enters *liúhuáng*, the toxicity is immense—how could it be consumed?*

*As for *Qīfǎn Dānshā* (七返丹砂), though it is subjected to repeated refining to suppress its toxicity, it still retains the fundamental essences of the *Sìxiàng* (四象) and *Wǔxíng* (五行)—the sinews, bones, blood, and flesh, along with the incomplete balance of *yīn* (阴) and *yáng* (阳) and *hēi* (黑). If consumed, it will dry the five *zàng* (藏) organs. When ordinary people’s blood is diminished, they weaken; when it is exhausted, they die."*"

*Hóng* (泓) asked again: *"In the world, some alchemists refine *Dānshā* (丹砂), and though its grains and lumps remain unbroken and its color unchanged, it does not move even when subjected to intense fire. How should this be understood?"*

九霄君 said: *"All cinnabar, when it first congeals, forms within sand and stone. Even the purest *liúhuáng* (硫黄), when powdered, yields only twelve *liǎng* (两) of mercury per *jīn* (斤), while the remaining four *liǎng* are the dregs of mountains and marshes—these contain immense toxicity. If Daoists do not extract these dregs, and instead consume them together, it will obstruct the flow of *qi* in the meridians, dry the blood, and how could this bring benefit?

From ancient times to now, Daoists unversed in the highest teachings of transcendence have claimed that cinnabar refined by *fǔhuǒ* (伏火) is 'dead' mercury, falsely stating that metallic cinnabar entering the five *zàng* (藏) organs ensures an immortal fate—this is greatly mistaken. Who in the world does not know that those who consume it raw invariably die? Only *liúhuáng* stands alone, unadulterated with other medicines, yet can still dispel lingering *jīlíng* (积玲). Even so, it must not be consumed in excess, for it is a solitary *yáng* (阳) and its *qi* is incomplete.

Other minor medicines are beyond consideration here.

*Hóng* (泓) asked again: *"Which medicines can be safely consumed to prolong life?"*

九霄君 replied: *"The true elixirs of our Daoist immortals are all forged from the *rúnhún* (日魂) of the sun and the *yuèpò* (月魄) of the moon, shaped by the four *qì* (气) of nature. The *rúnhún* never departs from its solar essence, nor does the *yuèpò* leave the moon. If even the elixirs are inseparable from their origin in wood, why so? Wood’s verdant hue contains mercury, which harbors its fiery *yáng* (阳) essence—this is the symbol of cinnabar. Cinnabar belongs to the *Lí* (离) element, the domain of southern fire. Fire resides in cinnabar, just as fire is inherent in wood, and when wood and fire are harmonized with central *tǔ* (土), earth can subdue water while fire nourishes earth, thus completing the Dao. It is akin to a newborn child growing into adulthood, then becoming a parent, passing on the cycle eternally—this is the very principle at work.

The essence of the elixir originates from one source, never two. The fundamental root of the Dao is the heart, while its vital function lies in the four seasons’ *qì* (气), each manifesting its own purpose. The Dao arises with *qi* and perishes with *qi*. Those who consume the true elixir without death are because it does not mix with other flavors, retaining its original purity. When melted into a liquid and formed into vessels—whether square or round—it radiates a brilliant clarity, luminous both day and night. Only then is it fit for consumption. It dispels lethargy, steadies the spirit, banishes malevolent influences, endures cold and heat, moistens the skin, prevents graying of the beard and hair, and reverses aging—its effects can be verified within a thousand days. Thus, those who consume it do not die.

*Hóng* asked again: *"How many kinds of true elixirs exist?"*

九霄君 answered: *"There are three authentic paths: the first is the *Shénfú Shàngxiān Shàngdān* (神符上仙上丹), the second is the *Báixuě Zhōngxiān Shàngdān* (白雪中仙上丹), and the third is the *Jiǔzhuǎn Xiàxiān Shàngdān* (九转下仙上丹). These three elixirs share a single origin but bear different names, each possessing its own three *yī* (一) prohibitions, which must not be carelessly imparted to others. Why should they not be transmitted lightly?

For instance, the *Shénfú Dān* (神符丹)—if it is forged in the *Tàiyī Gōng Tiānyī Guān* (太一宫天一官) and completed in one cycle—is called *yè* (液), never taking solid form. The *Tiānyī Guān* (天一官) is its collective name, and these three prohibitions must not be revealed.

The *Báixuě Dān* (白雪丹), if it does not solidify into ice nor undergo *tiáoqīng* (调青), and fails to incorporate the black and green phases—its toxic essence remains distinct—is like the sun lacking its primordial *wū* (乌) or the moon lacking its *yuèpò* (月魄), thus incomplete. These three prohibitions must not be transmitted.

If *Báixuě* (白雪) does not solidify, and *tiáoqīng* (调青) is not like lodestone attracting needles, these three prohibitions must not be revealed.

When *Báixuě* (白雪) and *tiáoqīng* (调青) are properly congealed, the elixir enters its *Zǐgōng* (紫宫) phase, while the green undergoes the four *qì* (气) to encompass all phenomena and complete its form—these three prohibitions must not be transmitted.

If the elixir does not absorb the *hùndùn* (混沌) *qì* (气) of the four seasons, how could it be called the *Lónghǔ Dān* (龙虎之丹)? Thus, the Daoist immortals forge celestial treasures from the profound transformations of heaven and earth, mirroring the radiance of the sun and moon. When the *Shénfú* (神符) and *Báixuě* (白雪) elixirs are perfected, there is a path to ascension. The *Jiǔzhuǎn* (九转) elixir restores youth, making one’s complexion like that of a child, and grants a lifespan as enduring as the southern mountains.

These three prohibitions’ secrets must not be lightly divulged—how could this not be fitting?

*Hóng* asked again: *"The three prohibitions are profound and secretive; who then may receive this teaching?"*

九霄君 replied: *"Only one such as myself may impart it. These three prohibitions are the mechanisms of *Zàohuà* (造化), the creation and transformation of the universe. They are not unique to the elixir, for the human body also inherently possesses them. If one can cultivate the three prohibitions within their own body, then the child and parent will not be separated, and the spirit-*qi* will naturally protect itself, serene and harmonious, its light clear and bright. The child will not fail to see the sun’s radiant *yáng* (阳) or the moon’s luminous *yuèpò* (月魄). No winds or clouds will arise, no fine dust will move, and the azure sky will remain tranquil—how could there be any obstruction?

Humans too possess this. If one can constantly harmonize the three prohibitions, all anxieties will vanish, and their inner and outer *qi* will merge with the pristine essence of the sky, becoming radiant and unobstructed—thus, they too may ascend.

Some in the world may steal a glimpse of this teaching, claiming it is the practice of consuming *qì* (气)—nasal inhalation, oral exhalation, and swallowing by puffing the cheeks—but such methods will swiftly lead to their downfall. It is like mistakenly ingesting a poisonous elixir in the midst of medicines, beyond all remedy.

Thus, the three prohibitions within the body are no different from those of the true elixir. These prohibitions too must not be lightly transmitted.

*Hóng* asked again: *"If someone has already consumed cinnabar, *rǔshí* (乳石), *liúhuáng* (硫黄), or *zǐfěn* (紫粉), and the toxicity manifests, how may they be saved?"*

九霄君 answered: *"For those already dead from consumption, there is no need to speak of salvation. For those who ingested them afterward, they may still be saved. Urgently instruct the Daoist to forge *Bǎoxiān Wán* (保仙丸) to rescue them, and their life may yet be preserved.

For instance, if one consumes *zǐfěn* (紫粉) from *huàntóu* (换头), since it does not enter the congealed *báixuě* (白雪) to form bones—which are *yáng* (阳)—and if *tiáoqīng* (调青) is later introduced, it becomes *dàdú zǐfěn* (大毒紫粉). No matter the quantity consumed, near or far, once ingested, it is like eating impure substances—poisoning will manifest, regardless of the time of day or night, and it will not fall under the scope of medical prescriptions. Within three to five days, the original medicine can still save them."*

If one has ingested sulfur, *zǐfěn* (紫粉), suppressed *fúhuǒ* (伏火) cinnabar, or other *rǔshí* (乳石) and the poison manifests, the *Bǎoxiān Wán* (保仙丸) may still rescue them—**up to twelve or thirteen breaths remain**.

If one has previously ingested the poisons of these stone medicines, even if they have not yet manifested, by taking precautions and preemptively consuming the *Bǎoxiān Wán*, the effect is even more wondrous.

**Hóng** further asked: *"The Three Great Elixirs (三大丹) extend and sustain life—yet if the original poison remains, can they still be taken?"*

The **Jiǔxiāo Jun** (九霄君) replied: *"The *Shénfú Báixuě Jiǔzhuǎn* (神符白雪九转) has not undergone the *Tàiyī Gōng Tiānyī Gōng* (太一宫天一宫) refining—its Four Symbols (四象) are incomplete, and thus it cannot be ingested.*

If someone is about to take it and suddenly feels agitation or unease, they should immediately consume *fúlóng gānzhī* (伏龙肝汁), along with *gāncǎo tāng* (甘草汤) and *shēngméng dòuzhī* (生蒙豆汁)—this will stabilize them. Though death may still occur in rare cases, why? Because these three medicines, along with other miscellaneous substances, contain only empty fire-toxicity (*huǒdú*), thus failing to reach the point of fatality.

Apart from these three, other cinnabar-based elixirs—even if consumed in haste over a single day or night—can still enhance one’s complexion. But if agitation suddenly arises, their life is then in grave peril."

**Hóng** said: *"May I hear the method for the *Bǎoxiān Wán*?"*

The **Jiǔxiāo Jun** replied: *"The *Bǎoxiān Wǔzǐ Wán* (保仙五子丸) is a secret method of the Daoists. Yet I shall entrust it to those of Dao—those who guard life. Now I shall instruct you in detail, along with a general outline of the Three Elixirs. You must ponder this deeply, transmit it to save those yet unaware, and never forget my words. I shall depart now."*

**Hóng** then wept, knelt, and bowed twice in reverence. The **Jiǔxiāo Jun** raised his hand in farewell before ascending into the clouds and vanishing.

**Liú Hóng** (刘泓) then carved the teachings onto stone in the mountains, and later, a Daoist discovered and transcribed them, allowing the method to spread throughout the world. During the **Tang Dynasty’s Kāiyuán era (开元)**, the **Tōngxuán Xiānsheng Zhāng Guǒ** (通玄先生张果) presented this formula to the emperor. The emperor rejoiced and kept it secret within the palace. **Tōngxuán** also elaborated extensively on the virtues of the Three Elixirs, though the methods for refining them are omitted here to avoid redundancy.

The **Yànmén Gōng** (雁门公) recorded and understood this fully.
