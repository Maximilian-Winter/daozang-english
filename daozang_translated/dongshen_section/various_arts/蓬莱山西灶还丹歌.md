### *The Song of Returning Elixir from the Western Furnace of Mount Penglai, Scroll One*
**Composed by Huang Xuanzhong, Han Examiner of the Court of Judicature and Revision, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness with Gold and Purple Insignia**

Your servant has heard that the wren in the trees does not seek more than a single branch for its nest, and the field mouse drinks from the river only to fill its belly. Yet Your Majesty’s fame surpasses that of Donghu, and your governance harmonizes the southern winds, bringing peace to the myriad people—none fail to find repose. Why then do you prize the glory of the imperial chariot yet slight the Dao of immortality?

Your servant humbly submits: In the Yuanfeng era, by imperial decree, I journeyed to Mount Penglai to seek the wondrous arts. I endured the perils of the sea, traversed the hidden yang, and risked death in pursuit of the supreme Dao. By the distant grace of Your Majesty’s favor, moved by this humble servant’s devotion, I encountered a great immortal who bestowed upon me the sacred elixir. With utmost sincerity, I presented it to the throne. How could Your Majesty heed the words of flattering ministers, mistaking it for heresy and deceit, and command your servant to consume it himself? Soon after, I took leave of the imperial court, overcome with sorrow and longing. Before I could fully explore the palaces, a decade passed in fleeting moments, and I feared that leisurely deliberation would forever bar my return.

Later, I learned that Your Majesty had ordered Dongfang Shuo to summon the Queen Mother of the West and erect a dew-receiving basin—clear proof of Your Majesty’s deep regret. Your servant has heard that to serve one’s lord with loyalty and stand by one’s friends with righteousness is the way of the minister. Disloyalty to the sovereign invites punishment from all officials; betrayal of friends brings abandonment by all companions. At the Western Furnace of the Shaowei Courtyard in the Ziyang Palace, I personally received the wondrous Dao of the returning elixir and secretly recorded its formula. I implore Your Majesty to heed the admonitions of loyal ministers and verify this method. Do not repeat the errors of past years by yielding to the words of vulgar flatterers.

The elixir shall be compounded by Left Reminder Chen Fangjing, with Right Aide Zhou Zhenyuan overseeing the firing. My son, Zhicheng, will tend the furnace and perform the offerings, ensuring the refinement is precise and subtle. With earnest devotion, may the purple jade briefly appear, and may Your Majesty’s bones become golden for eternity.

Why cling to the grandeur of the Hanlin Palace, which is but the essence of the mortal realm? The Northern Gate and Western Hall are far from vast; the Nine Divisions of the Imperial Sacrifices cannot compare to true harmony; the powdered and rouged chambers are but ugly vessels. How much more sublime is the unparalleled wonder of Mount Penglai, famed as the immortal mountain! Here stand the palaces of the sun and moon, cloud chambers and golden pavilions. Halls are adorned with gold and jade, towers gleam with coral, magpies encircle sacred mushrooms, and simurghs soar among jade trees. Heavenly boys and jade maidens stir the cauldrons with song, while rare birds and famed fowl arrive without cease. Beyond the crystal curtains, the mysterious wind rustles; within the jasper doors, fine rain drizzles. A single sip of jade nectar grants a thousand years; a moment’s taste of the great elixir ensures ten thousand ages. Soon you will witness the mulberry fields turn to sea, and the sea revert to mulberry fields. Some ascend to attend the Heavenly Elder, others pass through the Cloud Gate, descending to Yingzhou to seek rare treasures. The yellow-roofed halls of the mortal world are not worthy of reverence; even the embroidered robes of high ministers cannot compare in nobility.

Why does Your Majesty not personally visit these wondrous realms, instead suffering the bonds of the mundane? Soon you will see your crown entombed in the stone hall, your body buried in the earth, leaving your descendants to kneel in vain, pouring libations at your cold mausoleum. In the span of a morning and evening, this fate will be upon you. Even a hundred years as Son of Heaven cannot equal a single day as an immortal.

I beseech Your Majesty’s sagacious judgment: do not seek your own demise.

Respectfully dispatched, the Elixir-Bearing Youth of Nanyang, to present this memorial for Your Majesty’s consideration.

**Huang Xuanzhong, Right Senior Minister of the Purple Tenuity of Mount Penglai’s Nanyang, prostrates and respectfully submits.**

All who uphold this sacred Dao must seek it without deviation, through purity, fasting, and tranquil contemplation. The furnace must be established and the stove arranged; one must not act contrary to the divine methods. Every movement and mechanism must align with the Dao of Heaven. The mineral and herbal ingredients must be of the finest quality, without error.

All herbs are tribute from the provinces, save three varieties native to this mountain. Six common mortal ingredients may be substituted, as listed below.
