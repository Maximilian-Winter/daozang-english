**General Preface to the *Zhigui Ji***
By Wu Wu, the Hermit of Gaogai Mountain

The preface states: The world possesses the natural Dao; the myriad things possess their natural principles. If one fails to grasp these principles, things cannot be understood—how much less can one avoid perishing in the Dao? The Way of divine transcendents is most profound and wondrous, achieved through the accumulation of deeds and the amassing of merit. Human life spans a hundred years, yet those who reach seventy are few. Even with diligent cultivation and accumulated merit, how much can one truly amass? Thus, those who seek transcendence must pursue longevity, and through the accumulation of merit and deeds, the teachings of *waidan* (external elixir) transmutation arose. Yet when illness strikes, the practices of talismanic invocation and firing the furnace are disrupted, giving rise to the arts of *neidan* (internal elixir) and tranquil cultivation.

From antiquity to the present, though many have cultivated *neidan*, none have ascended without first refining *waidan*. The doctrines of *neidan* involve nothing more than the union of heart and kidney, the circulation of essence and *qi*, the preservation of spirit and breath retention, and the exchange of old and new breath. Some specialize in the arts of the bedchamber, others absorb the essences of the sun and moon, still others ingest herbs or practice grain avoidance and spousal abstention—all in pursuit of tranquility. Among these, only the preservation of spirit and breath retention, when practiced with utter detachment from worldly concerns, often resemble *dhyāna* meditation. Even if successful, such practices rely on the *yin* dwelling (the body), and their effects are not enduring; they may suffice for a time but cannot sustain one through change.

Yet these teachings also speak of *yin-yang*, the Eight Trigrams, the Four Symbols, the Five Phases, and the mercury-lead, dragon-tiger (metaphors)—for the sages did not wish to recklessly divulge celestial secrets and thus veiled them in the language of *waidan*. Hence the ancient song declares: *"The inner medicine is none other than the outer medicine."* Its meaning runs deep. Alas, later generations, failing to fathom the intent of the ancients or comprehend the principles of nature, seize upon some minor peripheral method and claim that *neidan* alone can achieve transcendence, that immortality can be attained. Little do they realize that since antiquity, no transcendent has ever relied solely on *neidan* without also refining *waidan*.

Today, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands across the world all bear traces of elixir refinement and ascension, with furnaces, wells, and cinnabar cauldrons still extant. If it were true that one must first perfect *neidan* before employing *waidan* for transmutation, then how is it that the servants, parrots, and dogs of ancient transcendents ascended alongside them? Were they, too, first perfected in *neidan*? Others obsessively seek rare herbs or smelt metals and minerals, unaware that herbs, though potent, rot when soaked in water and char when burned by fire—how can they endure? All these are those who fail to grasp principle.

From youth, I have yearned for the Dao, and for twenty years now, I have frequently encountered perfected beings who imparted to me divine secrets. Their teachings trace back to the Divine Farmer, who tasted the hundred herbs and instructed the people in their use, declaring: "This is cold in nature, that is hot; this is warm and balanced, that is deadly." Only cinnabar (*dansha*) could preserve both spirit and form. Thus, when the human heart and spirit are agitated, cinnabar is used; when the corpse wishes not to decay, mercury is employed. Mercury, responsive to the *qi* of *yin* and *yang*, crystallizes into cinnabar after eight hundred years, into silver after three thousand, and into gold after eighty thousand—growing ever more durable with time, undergoing myriad transformations. The sages harnessed water and fire, modeled the *qi* of *yin* and *yang*, and brought their work to completion—this is what is meant by "seizing the mechanism of creation."

From cinnabar to silver, from silver to gold, the *jinyi huandan* (golden liquid returning elixir) is extracted and ingested—herein lies the principle of longevity. Master Xiahou the Celestial Master said: "The ancient sages nourished spirit with superior medicines, temperament with middling medicines, and dispelled illness with inferior medicines." The term *dan* (elixir) derives from its color. The *Bencao* (Materia Medica) refers only to *dansha* (cinnabar). The term *huan* (return) signifies the water of Heavenly One descending to the earth of Earthly Ten, restoring its original hue. This is what Master Lü meant by "the returns of the five directions," all bearing the name *dan*.

Naturally formed elixirs are rare in the world. The cinnabar found today contains only mercury, which cannot be consumed raw and must be refined—hence the term *liandan* (refined elixir). The *jiuzhuan* (nine cyclings) refer to the daily progression of two hexagrams, with twelve lines corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Beginning at *zi* (the first), it concludes at nine, symbolizing the cycle—all secrets passed down from the Divine Farmer. The text is called the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* (Scripture of the Golden and Azure Dragon-Tiger). The Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons Elixir, achieved perfection, and ascended—later generations mistakenly attributed this text to him.

Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* (Token for the Agreement of the Three), Master Cui’s *Ruyao Jing* (Mirror for Entering the Medicine), Qingxiazi’s *Huandan Jue* (Secrets of the Returning Elixir), and Master Peng’s *Jinyaoshi Lun* (Discourse on the Golden Key)—their origins are ancient, and the hundred schools trace their source to these works. Generally, the words of the sages are profound, like the records of celestial patterns, their principles subtle and obscure. Only when transmitted orally by those who have attained the Dao can success be assured—such is the nature of principle.

Zhang Pingshu said: *"Waidan* is difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish." This is true attainment of the Dao. I deeply lament the difficulty later learners face in encountering (true teachings) and grieve the loss of transmission of the great Dao. Thus, I have compiled the words of the ancient sages and directly pointed to their essentials, calling this work *Zhigui* (Pointers to the Return), offering it to those of shared aspiration.

**The *Zhigui Ji***
**The Returning Elixir Requires No Medicines**

The *Aozhi Zhenjue* (Profound Pointers to the True Secrets) states: The ancient transcendents spoke only of lead and mercury, never of the Four Yellows or Eight Stones. If even a single miscellaneous ingredient is added, it becomes a poison, harming the intestines and stomach upon ingestion. Fools take these杂药 to subdue mercury, forcing it to withstand fire, and feed it to others, calling it "dead mercury" that can preserve life—how grievously they mislead and harm people! Moreover, alum can slay tigers, and saltpeter can corrode copper; if such substances enter mercury and flow into the human abdomen, death is certain—ten thousand will die, ten thousand will perish.

Qingxiazi said: "The Eight Stones, when exposed to fire, all turn to ashes; cinnabar, when immersed in water, transforms into silver."

The Venerable Master Ge* says:
Green Dragon and White Tiger share the same root,
Yet it is the two qi that shape the immortal’s form.
True lead is the elixir of long life—
Do not believe the common claim that "medicines bring merit."

Lord Lao* once said: □ The sage refines the elixir without medicines,
Only the divine chamber is wrought of gold.
The *Scripture of Gold and Azure* states: "South and north alone form the warp."
Huang’s commentary says: In refining the Great Elixir, no miscellaneous medicines are added,
Only Kan and Li* are employed.
Guangchengzi* says: "Purely refine the marrow of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang."
Monk Ruoqing* says: "Yellow Sprout is no external thing—
Within the image, extract the essence."
(External thing: also rendered as "worldly medicine.")
The scriptures say: The numinous elixir is formed from a single ingredient,
With no external medicines added.
It is like the clam absorbing the moon’s radiance,
Forming a pearl within its belly—
How could it rely on strange substances to achieve this?

Lead is not worldly lead; mercury does not reside [in the ordinary].
If lead is misapplied, the qi will die.
The cinnabar within stone is the essence of father and mother,
Thus the body itself contains true lead.
Among the twenty-four grades of the Great Elixir,
Two hundred in number, the Yellow Sprout is foremost.
Lead is yang within yin; mercury is yin within yang.

Master Cen* says: "If one refines the various Eight Stones,
A thousand attempts yield not a single success."
Master Cao* says: "The world does not know the source—
The many stones lead only to error."
Lord Yin* says: "The good has no head; the cauldron has no ears.
Without medicines, one should proceed with restraint."

Han Yunzhong*, a recluse of Mount Taibai’s northern slopes, says:
"From ancient times to the present, those fond of such arts number like hemp,
Yet deviating from the master, they obscure the true teaching.
Mercury is yin; lead is yin’s stubborn counterpart.
Plucking blossoms to form the eleventh sprout—
This is called Dragon and Tiger.
Worldly gold and silver, paired as mother and child,
When gathered for elixir refinement, bring only untimely death.
Such errors abound, grossly misguided."

Zhang Pingshu* says: "Do not refine the Three Yellows or Four Spirits.
If you seek among the many herbs, it is not the true Way.
For Heaven and Earth’s transformations never employ medicines.
Today, many use poisonous substances to subdue cinnabar,
Feeding it to others—
How many are thus misled!
These are the harms of toxic medicines,
Not the fault of cinnabar—
Can one not discern this?"

The Returned Elixir consists solely of lead and mercury.
Zheng Siyuan* says: "The Tiger is silver—
This is the Golden Duke, belonging to water and metal.
The Dragon is mercury—
This is the Alchemical Maiden, belonging to wood and fire.
Metal generates water; water generates wood;
Wood generates fire; fire generates earth—
The Dao resides in this earth."

Master Wei* says: "Swallows do not hatch phoenixes;
Foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Without true father and mother,
All offspring are false."

Guangchengzi says: "To leave the Li Palace is but a trifling matter—
Seek within the Kan Chamber and refine the essence."
Master Yang* says: "Within yin there is yang; within yang there is yin.
Having recognized mercury within cinnabar,
One must seek gold within lead."

Yin Changsheng* says: "Gold forms the bones, mercury the body—
Yin and yang unite, naturally drawn together."
Master Tao Zhi* says: "If you wish to still mercury,
Rely on the power of Kan and Li."
Monk Ruoqing says: "If the sprout is lead, depart from lead by ten thousand miles.
If the sprout is not lead, begin with lead."

Master Zhang Hua* says: "When the Tiger is subdued, the Dragon hides;
When the Dragon lies low, the Tiger is first subdued."
Lord Lao’s *Records of the Pass of Hangu* says:
"Red lead and black mercury are the head of the Great Elixir—
Mercury alone, in its singular mystery, is profoundly subtle."

The *Scripture of the Sacred Stone* says: "Gold transforms into gold; silver transforms into silver."
Master Zhang the Celestial Master* says: "Lead draws out the marrow; mercury draws out the essence.
When essence and marrow unite, the elixir is surely formed."

Master Taiyi* says: "The art of inverting the Five Phases—
The Dragon emerges from within fire.
The Five Phases do not proceed in order—
The Tiger is born within water."

For among all things under Heaven,
Only the subdued can restrain the soaring;
The Tiger is subdued, and the Dragon takes flight.
Only the still can restrain the moving—
Yin is still, and yang moves.
Thus, with lead to subdue mercury,
The principle lies herein.

Lead and mercury must be truly of the Three*
The *Profound Pointers to the True Secrets* states:
"Only fear that the lead is not true—
When the elixir is formed, the medicine is naturally efficacious.
Only fear that the mercury is not correct—
When the elixir is formed, the medicine is naturally sacred."

Master Tao* says: "If the lead is true, it does not lose its household minister.
If the lead is not true, its mercury will be difficult to unite."
The *Can Tong Qi* says: "When lead and mercury attain their truth,
They naturally follow one another from beginning to end."
Lead is not silver; mercury is not wood.

The Most High says: "One thing divides into two—
Half resembles lead, half resembles mercury."
An ancient poem says: "Temporarily borrow lead’s root—
If lead is not fully removed, how can it become the supreme medicine?"

The *Resolving Doubts on the True Secrets* says:
"Decisively employ the two substances, lead and mercury—
If they are not worldly lead and mercury, they become the supreme medicine.
One should select and apply their most refined methods."

Qingxiazi says: "Lead is the mother of the sprout."
The commentary says: "Metal can generate water; water can generate metal—
Thus, the sprout is born within lead, which is the proof.
Hence, the secret says: Lead can restrain mercury; mercury can subdue lead.
When lead and mercury take form, it is called restraint and subjugation.
Wood can generate fire; fire can also generate wood—
Thus, mercury is born within cinnabar, which is the proof.
Therefore, mercury is called wood because it receives the qi of the Great Yang,
Transforming into flowing pearls.
The Great Yang is the sun; the sun rises in the east, and the east belongs to wood.
The Great Yin is the moon; the moon is born in the west, and the west belongs to metal.
Thus, in the Returned Elixir, establishing the image is the standard.
Recognizing true lead requires knowing true mercury.
Gold within water—metal generates water, thus silver is the mother of lead.
Mercury within cinnabar is the Dark Pearl.
Yellow earth restrains water, preventing its flow—
Metal and water generate one another.
Yet metal overcomes wood; water conquers fire.
Earth flourishes in all four seasons—
The mutual generation from beginning to end,
The mutual conquest of the Five Phases,
The Three and Five unite to form the supreme medicine."

The Five Phases: water generates wood—this is mercury. Wood generates fire—this is cinnabar. Fire generates earth—this is the true earth transformed by spirit and qi. Earth generates metal—this is white metal. Metal generates water—this is black water. None of these are the silver, cinnabar, or earth of the mundane world.

The sprout is the child of lead; once the golden flower is seen, gather the lead yet do not employ it. The *Danjian* states: "Lead is lead, mercury is mercury—people of the world all misuse them." Yang Yuanyi said: "To seek immortality and find the yellow lead, one must obtain the true essence of lead." Huangzi said: "People of the world all study to seek the medicine, yet none truly find it."

The Dao employs lead yet does not employ lead; when it comes to employing lead, to employ lead is still mistaken. *Wangjiangnan* says: "In the beginning of learning the Dao, one must obtain true lead." Only by clarifying the essence of the Five Phases can transformations be boundless—how wondrous, how wondrous!

**The Mutual Generation and Conquest of the Five Phases**
The *Yinfu Jing* states: "Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection. Heaven has five thieves; those who see them prosper." Thus, Qingxiazi said: "Mercury is the Green Dragon, governed by the *Zhen* trigram, stored in the liver, belonging to the east and the *jia-yi* wood. Wood generates fire; fire governs the heart, the south and the *bing-ding* fire, governed by the *Li* trigram. Its form is originally green, but when it meets fire, it turns red—thus it transforms into cinnabar, becoming the Vermilion Bird, belonging to yang. When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—within cinnabar lies vermilion mercury, which also resembles the two lines within the *Li* trigram. Just as within the sun lies the Golden Crow, and the crow, being female, belongs to yin, it is the Dark Warrior, governed by the *Kan* trigram, stored in the kidneys, belonging to the north and the *ren-gui* water. Lead resembles the *Kan* trigram’s water, being yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—within black lead lies white metal, like the single line within *Kan*, or like the rabbit within the moon. The rabbit, being male, belongs to yang. Metal is the White Tiger, governed by the *Dui* trigram, stored in the lungs, belonging to the west and the *geng-xin* metal. When metal returns to its nature, water and fire naturally dissolve and melt. Its color turns to yellow, which governs the spleen, the spleen being the central *wu-ji* earth. The liver, green, is the father of wood; the lungs, white, are the mother of metal; the kidneys, black, are the child of water; the spleen, yellow, is the sovereign of earth. The Five Phases mutually propel one another, all residing within them.

In general, the Five Phases generate one another in return and restrain one another in turn. Thus, metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal. Yet in their restraint: metal conquers wood, wood conquers earth, earth conquers water, water conquers fire, and fire conquers metal. Therefore, mercury is metal. With metal, one fells wood; cinnabar is fire. With fire, one melts metal; lead is water. With water, one extinguishes fire. When water becomes abundant, earth is used to restrain it. Responding to their kind, restraining with their qi—the great elixir is accomplished.

The *Jinbi Jing* states: "Evolving the lines and verifying the trigrams, the Five Phases are the pivot. *Kan* is the male essence of metal; *Li* is the female radiance of fire. Metal and fire contend; water and earth conquer. When earth flourishes in the domain of metal, the three substances all perish. Their convergence brings about great peace."

Chunyu Shutong said: "The nature of wood is to be upright, yet it is harmed by metal. The nature of water is to be yielding, yet it is conquered by earth. Though earth is thickly heaped, it is harmed by wood. Though metal is firm, it is melted by fire. This mutual conquest of the Five Phases is the constant principle of the great Dao."

Master Cao said: "Seize the eastern Dragon and pair it with the western Tiger. Then take the southern Vermilion Bird to meet the northern Dark Warrior. Among them, the most essential is the central earth."

Yan Junping said: "One, two, three, four, five—metal, wood, water, fire, earth. If one can understand this secret, it is the path to longevity."

Zhang Pingshu said: "When the two substances meet, their natures harmonize; where the Five Phases are complete, the Tiger and Dragon coil. For it is clear that without earth, the Five Phases do not generate, and without earth, the golden elixir does not form."

**Fire Timing Lies in the Precise Examination of the Five**
Qingxiazi said: "From the first month to the seventh month in *shen*, it is the Seven Returns. From the eleventh month to the seventh month, it is the Nine Revolutions. The fire begins with the first yang." The commentary states: "Without the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions of lead and mercury, they will not form; even if formed, they will not be efficacious. This is the *fu* of the eleventh month, the *lin* of the twelfth month, the *tai* of the first month, the *dazhuang* of the second month, the *guai* of the third month, the *qian* of the fourth month, the *gou* of the fifth month, the *dun* of the sixth month, the *pi* of the seventh month, the *guan* of the eighth month, the *bo* of the ninth month, and the *kun* of the tenth month. Refining the medicine into the elixir completes one cycle, encompassing the twenty-four qi. The returned elixir is purple-red, with the two qi fulfilled—radiant, weighty, without loss of its original weight, all transformed into true earth, with boundless transformations."

He also said: "The *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* months are spring; the *mao*, *chen*, and *si* months are summer—these six months are purely yang in action, with yin seeking yang, and water soaking in color. The *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* months are autumn; the *you*, *xu*, and *hai* months are winter—these six months are purely yin in action, with yang seeking yin, and water congealing and solidifying. Metal disperses and enters water; the qi of water and fire contend, their forms merging and struggling, moving without fixed direction, rising and falling without constancy. Water ascends when it meets fire; metal submits when it meets fire. Mutually requiring transformation, they congeal within the vessel—the body of the returned elixir, wondrous and unfathomable."

The *Jinbi Jing* states: "When *kun* first transforms into *zhen*, on the third day the moon appears in *geng*. The Dragon and Tiger seek one another; when *kun* transforms again into *dui*, on the eighth day the moon is in *ding*—the upper crescent, half a catty of metal. When the *kun* body transforms into *qian*, it shines round in *jia* of the east. Metal and water warm the Great Yang; red water flows as mercury. Mercury plays in the golden crucible; the moon waxes through union and wanes. At sixteen transformations, life begins; the *qian* body wanes into *xun*. At dawn, the moon appears in *xin*; *qian* is further diminished into *gen*."

At the twenty-third appearance, *gen* is seen—half a catty of water in the lower crescent. The moon emerges in the south of *bing*; *qian* transforms thrice into *kun*. On the thirtieth day, *kun* and *yi* lose their companions in the northeast. The moon sets in the land of *yi*; earth, wood, and metal are about to transform, and the succeeding body gives birth to the *zhen* Dragon.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The fire record is six hundred, making sixty days. Within day and night, the four qi’s nodes—such is the Dao of transformation, exhausted." Time accumulates into days, days into months, months into years. Within a single day of twelve hours, it is divided in two: six hours for yang, six for yin. The central yang and the four qi—fire follows the same pattern.

The *Taigu Huolong Jing* says: "The Bright Dragon, endowed with the true yang qi’s color, returns to green, nurturing the Fire Palace. It receives the true qi of four thousand three hundred and thirty years—hence called the Fire Dragon." Sima Wei’s commentary notes: "According to the *Jinjing Taisu Jing*, cinnabar is endowed with the true yang’s qi and contains the utmost yin’s essence. From its gestational qi, after four thousand three hundred and twenty years, it forms the elixir body thus. Therefore, in the *fu* hexagram, fire requires four thousand three hundred and twenty years to complete the Great Elixir."

Master Ge the Perfected says: "The fire-timing of bathing is not recorded in texts; one must encounter a realized master to receive the oral transmission. For the fire-timing is the greatest essential in the elixir—though former and later sages have detailed it in writing, it is not that they did not transmit it. As for its subtleties, they cannot be fully grasped, so all depends on the moment. Only those of the Dao’s path examine it with careful intent."

The mechanism of ancient heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the workings of creation—sages have recorded them in books, with every detail complete, transmitting them to later ages to let all under heaven know the return of the supreme Dao. Yet foolish and deluded fools, perverse and obstinate, disbelieve the sages, claiming that the world’s mechanism cannot be revealed. Thus they turn their backs on the supreme Dao, dying without awakening. This is no other reason than that their conduct does not accord with principle, so their minds do not penetrate principle and do not enter the Dao.

The sages’ minds—do they lie outside principle? That which the *Yinfu Jing* calls "revealing heaven’s mechanism, sinking it for three kalpas"—it speaks of deluded fools who toy with the Great Dao, treating it as unreasonable, not that they wish the Dao to have no transmission. Now, the Dao of Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu, and the teachings of the Zhou and Confucius, lie in the Six Classics. Earnestly they instruct, wishing all under heaven to become scholar-gentlemen, and all scholar-gentlemen indeed emerge from them. As for the return of petty men, though they read them, they do not understand. The books of the Buddha fill the world, with teachings of every kind, wishing all under heaven to become Buddhas, and all Buddhas indeed emerge from them. As for those who delight in creating evil karma, though they recite them, they do not comprehend.

Moreover, the books of Fuxi and Shennong have long been transmitted in the world—how could they still harbor concealment? Only those whose minds are attuned to the Dao and whose conduct accords with principle, upon seeing them, naturally awaken to principle and attain the Dao. I have pored over alchemical classics, over a hundred and ten schools. Though their words differ, their principles are truly one. Thus I have selected the most accessible and compiled them above. The cited scriptures, songs, and poems—some begin with Master Jia, while transmitters attribute them to Yi; or a single essential word appears across various schools.

For instance, among the hundreds of methods of the golden elixir, the essential lies in the divine water and the Flowery Pond, originally from Li Quan’s *Yinfu Jing* method, yet various schools cite it as scripture. Such cases rely only on what I have heard, without leisure to investigate their origins and beginnings. I record them to transmit their principles, forgetting their fishing weirs and rabbit snares. Where inconsistencies arise, many are books forged by magicians since the Qin and Han. Scholars, by applying principle, will naturally see through them.

The *Collected Pointers to the Return* is now complete.
