**The Return of Gold: An Account with Preface**

Tan once read the *Scripture of Gold and Azure*, where Master Wei states: "The three, five, and one are the essence of heaven and earth." After a decade of reflection, the profound meaning became clear. The "one" is the number of water, the origin of the Five Phases, its color derived from the north, encompassing the five hues. Cultivated to align with the Dao, its principle accords with nature, enabling it to generate heaven and earth, to be both female and male. Then, the essence of the sun returns to the moon’s chamber, the purest flower coalesces within the central qi, its numinous workings responding in harmony—none of this can be glimpsed or stolen by worldly practitioners.

Today’s scholars widely claim that mercury can become elixir gold, and cinnabar-mercury can become the river chariot. Yet they do not realize that mercury is born of lead, and cinnabar is produced from gold. Failing to discern the true, they substitute other substances. This is like sewing flowers to make seeds or severing the body to induce pregnancy—it harms one’s essence and qi, leaving nothing whole. The world has become a host of lost wanderers, their vessels leaky and not of primordial completion. Vast are the aspirants, all awaiting fulfillment.

Some say the ancients fabricated these teachings, that such a Dao never existed. This foolish view is not to be accepted. Thus, I have examined the scriptural principles and composed this account in three parts, presenting it to those of like mind.

---

**Upper Chapter**

The ancients borrowed the images of the *Book of Changes* to compose their scriptures, for the supreme Dao matches heaven and earth. Just as the Most High first divided the primordial qi into the Two Modes, and the Two Modes separated to form the Three Powers, so the Qian and Kun operate to rectify the myriad beings, and Kan and Li function to unite metal and water—this is the pivot of the Dao. Male and female unite, yin and yang harmonize, their qi intermingling, their bodies merging, responding to change without fixed form—this is the application of the Dao. The sun and moon move, cold and heat follow their seasons, fluids moisten and nourish, transformations flow and circulate—this is the verification of the Dao. Yin extends while yang withdraws, yang acts while yin conceals, going forth and returning, emotions align with nature—this is the return of the Dao.

From this, it is clear: dividing the primordial qi to model heaven and earth, there is naturally a convergence with the primordial. How could one rely on other substances to achieve this? Now, according to the *Inner Scripture of the Yellow and White*, Shennong says: "Know the white, guard the black, and you will not die." The "white" is the essence of metal, not worldly gold. The "black" is mercury, not worldly mercury.

The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: "Thus, lead is black externally but harbors golden flowers within." The "golden flowers" are the Azure Dragon, yellow lead, Qian, residing in the position of wood, its number three. It also says: "Clad in coarse robes, yet holding jade within, outwardly a madman." The "jade" is the White Tiger, mercury, Kun, residing in the position of earth, its number five. Thus it is said: "When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals form the proper framework." Three and five are the positions of earth and wood. Combined, their number is eight.

It further states: "Gold is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child in her womb. Water is the child of gold; the child hides in the mother’s embryo." This speaks of gold and water containing and gestating each other, returning to the mother’s casket, awaiting transformation to be born. It also says: "The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to establish the primordial foundation." This speaks of cinnabar being produced from gold, mercury flowing as the child. Nurturing the child with gold, it inherits the body and flourishes. The Dao accords with nature, its affairs rooted in the most subtle—this cannot be left unconsidered.

The *Secret Transmission* says: "Mysterious white gives birth to the Gold Elder, towering at the beginning of creation." This clarifies that cinnabar is born of lead. The *Song of Gold and Azure* says: "Red marrow flows as mercury; mercury plays with brightness." This clarifies that mercury is not a separate substance. It is born from the union of Qian and Kun, receiving qi to come into being. Though it does not yet live, its patterns shine brilliantly. Thus, the scripture says: "The sage does not fix life; gazing upward, he observes the celestial signs." The "celestial signs" are the tokens of truth. When heavenly qi descends and earthly qi responds, yin and yang unite, and the flowing pearl descends. The "flowing pearl" is also called flowing mercury.

The scripture says: "Cinnabar flows as the father of mercury; Wu and Ji are the mother of yellow gold." These passages suffice to show that cinnabar and mercury unite the Three Powers and correspond to the Five Phases—they are not worldly, ordinary substances. The *Triple Concordance* also says: "Plant grain with millet; hatch a chicken with its egg." This clarifies that emotion is derived from nature, and nature is bound to emotion. When emotion and nature depend on each other, returning to nature, this is called transformation. It is because lead and mercury, being of different kinds, do not function together. Yet in their true distinction, they ultimately depend on each other.

They are also Qian and Kun, female and male, metal and water, earth and wood, emotion and nature, dragon and tiger. Though they emerge from the same source under different names, they must unite with their kind. If there is deviation, they cannot intermingle. Thus it is said: "Those of the same kind follow each other; if affairs diverge, the treasure is not formed." Furthermore, water is overcome by earth, metal flourishes through earth, mutually overcoming and generating, alternating as father and mother.

Moreover, mercury does not occupy the proper position in the Five Phases, and cinnabar is not the union of dragon and tiger. Thus it is said: "Different kinds cannot share a body." Therefore, an ancient song says: "Do not harm my lead, and my life will be whole. Do not break my chariot, and I will return home." It also says: "If lead severs the river chariot, all efforts will be in vain. If lead breaks the river chariot, all works will have no outlet."

The *Five Chapters* says: "Within lead is gold; within gold is the treasure. Seeing the treasure, distinguish it; cultivate the mind and refine the form, and the worthy attain the Dao." It also says: "Better to refine the gold within lead than to refine the treasure within gold." These passages are the sages’ clear instructions to later learners. Fearing they might not understand, they repeatedly emphasized them.

Thus we know that the two matters of dragon and tiger originate from a single thing. Those who grasp their principle find it as easy as turning the palm of the hand. Those who lose their way are like those striving to ascend to heaven. Yet because people of the world have not awakened, each follows later teachings, abandoning the ease of turning the palm for the difficulty of ascending to heaven. The more earnest their intentions, the farther they stray from the truth, their myriad conflicting theories entangling the real and the false.

Some say one should use lead; others say mercury. If one uses mercury, how can heaven and earth be established? How can hardness and softness be divided? If one must use impure lead, how can metal and water be generated? How can the return and reversal be accomplished? And how could transformation occur if not by its authenticity?

Moreover, the songs and formulas of antiquity praise only the efficacy of lead and never speak of mercury’s subtleties. If the two must work together, why not extol both? If mercury is made the primary agent, merely borrowing the qi of lead to succeed, why abandon the root to preserve the branch?

The intent of the authors was thus. The understanding of later learners has become as such.

To till stones and plant rice, to angle for fish in greenwood—hoping for a harvest is difficult indeed. Moreover, what is transmitted in texts lacks the utmost refinement of firing, and what is taught in oral instructions falls short of an encounter with a perfected one. To know or not to know is as distant as a thousand *li* from the palm of one’s hand. Without a true person, how can one discern true principle?

Now, in discussing this with the multitude, some say the speaker does not know, while the knower does not speak—how then can one grasp the Dao, which lies hidden between speech and silence?

**Middle Section**
Those who claim mercury can be made into the elixir are deluded. Those who say cinnabar can prolong life do not understand the Dao. Misled by those who do not understand the Dao or by the words of the deluded, they stray far from the truth.

"Cinnabar-mercury" (*zhu gong*) is another name for the "old woman." "Cinnabar" (*sha*) is the supreme treasure within lead. What the alchemical classics call "cinnabar-mercury" (*sha gong*) is this true formula.

Moreover, within lead lies cinnabar-mercury, just as within a person lies temperament and nature. Temperament and nature are not external to a person, nor is cinnabar-mercury external to lead. The Dao of the Three-in-One refines temperament to unite with nature, and only then can one return to the root and restore simplicity.

The art of the Golden Liquor nurtures mercury with gold, and only then can the soul be returned and the primordial restored. If one borrows external things as temperament, nature cannot be united. If one substitutes mercury for cinnabar-mercury, lead cannot be embraced. If nature cannot unite the Three Palaces, how can it be stabilized? If lead cannot befriend the Eight Stones, how can it achieve subtlety?

The Eight Stones are but another name for the Three and Five. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: "Names are given to fix temperament; characters are given to nurture nature." It speaks of gold returning to its original nature, thereby earning the name *Returned Elixir*. It also says: "Nature dwells within, establishing the inner fortress. Temperament operates without, building the outer walls."

Thus, cinnabar-mercury is the temperament and nature of lead. Primordial *qi* is the root of humanity. Gold governs the external, hence it is called temperament. Mercury governs the internal, hence it is called nature. To refine mercury with gold is the meaning of uniting temperament with nature. To nourish essence and cultivate spirit is the Dao of refining nature to unite with the true.

It further states: "The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales its essence. The two consume each other, both coveting glory." The east’s *jia-yi* wood is the Azure Dragon; the west’s *geng-xin* metal is the White Tiger. The dragon is temperament; the tiger is nature. Temperament and nature depend on each other—this is the meaning of return and reversal.

An ancient song says:
*"Gather the body and restrain the soul to sate the tiger’s hunger,
The tiger comes to gaze and feed upon the marrow’s fat."*
Thus, the principle of inhalation and exhalation is made clear.

It also says: "The flowing pearl of Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man. Suddenly obtaining the flower of gold, it turns and abides, transforming into a white liquid, congealing into firmness. The flower of gold sings first; after a moment, it dissolves into water, its edges crumbling like horse’s teeth. Yang then goes to harmonize, and temperament and nature unite naturally."

Only by establishing Heaven and Earth, moving Water and Fire, responding to celestial signs, and harmonizing the Three Powers can one obtain the cinnabar of the elixir. Subtle words reveal the utmost path; the great Dao is supremely simple. It is like the workings of creation upon the myriad things—not through great artifice, but by their inherent blue, yellow, red, and white, each resembling the other. This is the principle of nature uniting with the true.

If one takes cinnabar as the essence of wood and combines it with gold, or says, "White Horse’s Teeth is fine cinnabar," or declares, "Seeing purity reveals the treasure, which can be made into yellow gold"—these are not the actions of common cinnabar and mercury. If one uses common cinnabar and mercury, in but a moment it will turn to white smoke. How then could it dissolve into water, its edges crumbling like horse’s teeth?

The discerning will reflect on this and, with a single word, distinguish the true and false among alchemists. If the alchemist is genuine, then correct nature will not be confused. If correct nature is not confused, one will draw daily nearer to the Dao, and the root will naturally be rectified. Why seek external fame, abandon worldly customs, or abstain from grain in mountain valleys to await rare encounters?

Thus, I have again expounded on temperament and nature, tracing them to cinnabar-mercury, and further elucidated the intent of the sages’ metaphors and analogies, composing this verse to leave no doubts for later scholars.

**Lower Section**
The classic states: "White is the essence of metal; black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao; its number is named." It also says: "Know the white, guard the black, and spirit and illumination will come of themselves." Thus, the essence of Great Mystery is the root of the Dao.

At its pivot, Heaven and Earth are forged, yin and yang are harmonized, and its work naturally accompanies creation. Therefore, fix the numbers of the two arcs, unite the upper and lower with two eights, and obtain the body of Qian and Kun. Examining the sixty-four hexagrams exhausts the functions of Heaven and Earth. Each hexagram has six lines, totaling three hundred eighty-four, wherein spirit is preserved.

The strategies of Qian number two hundred sixteen; those of Kun number one hundred forty-four. Extending and expanding these, touching upon categories and growing them, sums to eleven thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the number of the myriad things and completing the bodies of hardness and softness.

Moreover, the number of Heaven is twenty-five; the number of Earth is thirty. Together, the numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five, through which transformations are accomplished and return is achieved.

As for the accumulation of yang forming Heaven and the gathering of yin creating Earth—when Heaven is blocked and Earth is closed, spirit and illumination manifest. Though the workings of primal transformation are singular and its subtle uses boundless, they lie in harmonizing metal, wood, water, and fire with cold, heat, decay, and flourishing. Like the alternation of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, day and night, the function of yang is: metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth. The function of yin is: earth restrains water, water restrains fire, fire restrains metal, metal restrains wood. Through their mutual generation and restraint, waxing and waning in turn, they harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s four seasons to bring forth the myriad things.

The sun is the essence of yang; the moon is the spirit of yin. Gold is born of the moon—this is the youth of Kan.

The pearl glows within the sun—this is the maiden of Li.

Yet gold is the essence of the moon, occupying the yang position.
Mercury unites with the qi of Li, responding to the yin line.
By the numinous power of Heaven and Earth, it gestates the essence of sun and moon.
When closure reaches its extreme, openness returns; when yin is exhausted, yang arises.
Thus, when gold enters fierce fire, its color does not lose its luster.
Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never waned.

This is because metal and wood operate within, while water and fire respond without.
The creative power of Qian moves ceaselessly—this is how its function is achieved.
The radiance of the sun does not fade—this is how its vigor is enhanced.

Only Heaven and Earth, sun and moon endure long and lastingly,
beginning and ending with the myriad things.
As dragon and tiger unite in pairing, as the handle of the Dao’s helm,
they align with Heaven and Earth, conforming to the measures of yin and yang.
Thus, the primal transformation works in hidden accord,
like linked pearls or joined jade disks, revolving without end.

The ancient sages cultivated this,
fashioning and refining the ten thousand spirits.
Thus, they could generate Heaven and Earth,
initiate the myriad things, stand alone through the ages,
and preserve form and spirit without transformation.

How vast and profound is this wondrous function—
rare in a thousand ages, unfathomable!
Those who attain it hold Heaven and Earth in their hands,
with the workings of creation at their command.
From the common they ascend to the sacred,
their names inscribed in the golden register.
They stand alongside the Yellow Emperor and Lord Lao as forerunners,
for this is the gate one must turn to—there is no other path.

All who share this aspiration,
strive for this with utmost care:
seek the true instructions in detail,
and ensure transmission from a teacher.
Do not rely on flattering hearsay, shallow discourse, or verbose explanations,
lest you lose the central meaning and fall short of what is hoped for.

Alas! People today do not grasp the intent of the numinous and luminous,
nor comprehend the principles of Heaven and Earth.
They merely cling to the text, demanding literal proof,
or speculate based on their own conjectures.
Little do they know that the ancients have long since departed with what cannot be learned.
They debate the branches and leaves, missing the root,
leading one another astray in confusion—
how can they ever return to the altar?

Rustic pedants—how could they be the first to awaken?

I once served a venerable elder,
hearing these principles at his side.
He taught that without cinnabar and mercury, Qian and Kun cannot be attained;
without the Metal Duke, dragon and tiger have no means to enter.

Thus, I set forth these essentials to prevent error.

*A song says:*

The immortal claps hands—snow forms into spheres,
Yet yellow blossoms strive in vain to enter the Purple River.
Mother and child at once dissolve into flowing water,
Their transformations akin to nine-cycled elixir.

The account of returning gold is now complete.
