**First Transformation:**
Take **cinnabar** (朱砂) three *jīn* (斤), ground into powder. Mix with **Gua State alum** (瓜州矾) eighteen *liǎng* (两), grinding until thoroughly combined.
Use **salt flower** (盐花) as a container.
Next, place the mixed powder into a **cinnabar crucible** (丹釜). Seal with a **clay pot** (瓦瓮子), using **6:1 ratio clay** (六一泥) to secure the lid.

**Madame Cai’s Method:**
The pot’s base and belly should be lined with damp clay or **salt flower** (布). Use **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) to heat it, lasting three days and three nights as the measure.
When opened, sweep the transformed substance with **crow’s feathers** (乌羽)—it will be **liquid mercury** (水银). If not fully transformed, repeat the process until complete.

**Scripture Says:**
*"The Riverbank Maiden* (河上诧女), though subtle, is most divine.
When fire is obtained, she ascends—untainted by filth.
Ghosts conceal themselves, dragons hide—none know her path.
To subdue her, **yellow sprout** (黄芽) is the root.
This means capturing **mercurial qi** (金气), the germinating stage of her essence."

---

**Second Transformation:**
Take the **liquid mercury** (水银) produced from the first transformation. For every two *jīn* (斤) of mercury, add four *liǎng* (两) of **sulfur** (硫黄), grinding until thoroughly combined.
Place in a crucible, seal with **6:1 ratio clay** (六一泥), and heat with **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) for three days and three nights. When the crucible’s base turns **crimson** (赤色) like the flame, stop.

Upon opening, the mercury will have reverted to **cinnabar** (朱砂).
Then take the **cinnabar** (朱砂), seal and heat it again as before, until it turns **crimson** (赤) and transforms into an elixir (丹).
Thus, the **Cinnabar Scripture** (丹砂经) says:
*"Cinnabar is the essence of wood* (丹砂木精), *and when it meets mercury* (得金), *their union is complete.
The **mercurial qi** (金气) then gradually forms the elixir."*

---

**Third Transformation:**
Take the **cinnabar-merged elixir** (前丹砂) from the second transformation, grinding it into powder as in the first.
Again, take **Gua State alum** (瓜矾) per *jīn* (斤), mixing thoroughly with the powder.
Seal in a **clay pot** (瓮子) as before, heating with **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) for three days and three nights.
Open and sweep with **crow’s feathers** (乌羽)—it will again revert to **liquid mercury** (水银).
If not fully transformed, repeat until complete.

**Scripture Says:**
*"The Great Sun’s flowing pearl* (太阳流珠),
Ever seeks to leave mankind.
Yet when it meets **mercurial blossoms** (金花),
It turns and binds in harmony.
Wait until the white liquid congeals and hardens—
This means it has again absorbed the **mercurial qi** (金花之气),
Thus attaining the firmness of its nature."*

---

**Fourth Transformation:**
First, take a **gold-silver cauldron** (金银铛), capable of holding two or three *dǒu* (斗).
Use **premium Gua State alum stone** (上好瓜矾石) forty *liǎng* (两). Place the **mercury** (汞) into the vessel and simmer for thirty days until reduced to five *shēng* (升).
Take **five shēng of brine** (盐汁五升), mixing with the **alum water** (矾水) in the vessel and boil.
Add **one liǎng each of great phoenix sand** (大鹏砂), **malachite** (曾青), and **blue vitriol** (空青), simmering until the liquid reaches a **fish-eye boil** (鱼眼沸). Let it rest for one *fú* (伏) time.

Separately, take an **iron crucible** (铁鼎) capable of holding three *shēng* (升) or more. Pour in the **alum water** (矾水), then gradually add **liquid mercury** (水银), heating for seven days and seven nights.
Extract the **mercury** (汞) through a **silk bag** (绢中), collecting the thickened portion. Repeat the process with the remaining mercury until all is condensed.

**Scripture Says:**
*"Planting grain with millet* (植禾以粟),
Covering hens with their eggs* (覆鸡用子).
These transformations follow their own laws,
Yet they must rely on **mercurial qi** (金气) to intermingle."*

**Why so?**

Before the elixir’s components unite,
Before the trigrams and agents intermingle,
Yin and Yang must first separate to then coalesce.

**Sixth Transformation:**
Take the slightly hardened mercury from the Fifth Transformation.
In an iron pan, mix **realgar (雄黄)** two *liǎng*,
**calcined sand (炮砂)** five *liǎng*,
and **great phoenix sand (大鹏砂)** one *liǎng*,
ground into a powder in a medicinal vessel.
Add the **alum water (矾石水)** from the Fourth Transformation gradually,
simmering until a **fish-eye boil (鱼眼沸)**—
for **three times seven days and nights (三七日夜)**.
When it turns a pale yellow and can be struck upon the anvil,
stop immediately.
If not yet refined further,
adjust the fire accordingly—
until the yellow is malleable enough to strike.

**Scripture Says:**
*"When the **dragon and tiger** are harmonized and united,
They are led into the **Red Gate (赤色门)**,
Sealed at their juncture,
Made firm and unyielding.
Then, when mixed with the medicine and burned,
The firmness finds its proper place."*

**Seventh Transformation:**
Take the pale-yellow, hardened mercury from the Sixth Transformation,
melt it in the crucible to form a flat cake.
Take **calcined sand (炮砂)** ten *liǎng*,
**swallowed salt (盥)** one *shēng*,
and mix with three *dòu* of water.
Soak for one *fú* time, then add the mercury and simmer for **two times seven days (二七日)**.
Remove and strike upon the anvil.
If brittle, first burn the cake until red,
then wipe with **ram’s horn (羊角)** back and forth.
If too pliable, burn and wipe as before,
striking repeatedly until it reaches the proper malleability.
Finally, strike it into thin leaves like paper.

Again, take **calcined sand (炮砂)** ten *liǎng*,
**red earth (赤土)** five *shēng*,
and **Hu-tong resin (胡桐律)** one *liǎng*,
mixed and sifted through a **fine sieve (梼筛)**.
Layer upon the previously refined **golden leaves (金叶子)**,
then wrap according to the **gold-wrapping method (包金法)**,
burning in **cow-dung fire (牛粪火)** for over ten days,
until the color fades to absolute red.
This is the **subdued gold (伏金)**.

**Scripture Says:**
*"Gold is the essence of Yang.*
Only then can it be called **Returned Cinnabar (还丹)**—
When the **yellow gold** is refined back to its original vermilion hue,
It may be called Yang,
And thus becomes the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**."*

**Eighth Transformation:**
Take the **subdued gold leaves (伏火金叶子)** from the Seventh Transformation,
burn until red.
For every two *liǎng* of gold, add one *liǎng* of mercury,
grinding while hot until it becomes a dense **golden paste (金泥膏)**.
Shape into pieces the size of a fingernail,
and arrange them in the **elixir furnace (丹炉)**.

Take **swallowed salt (盥)**, **niter (硝石)**, and **Hu-tong resin (胡桐律)**—
each one *dà liǎng*,
ground finely and layered in succession,
until the furnace is completely filled.
Seal tightly and burn with **civilized and martial fires (文武火)** for three *fú* times.
When cooled, open it.
If the mercury has fully volatilized,
grind the remaining gold with **swallowed salt** and purify with water,
repeating until all mercury is exhausted.
The result is a **purple, granular powder (赫然紫色，如细砂)**.

**Scripture Says:**
*"When the **golden sand** enters the five viscera,
Its mist disperses like wind and rain.
It permeates the four limbs,
Brightening the complexion, reddening the face,
Glowing the hair and beard,
Extending life.
Taken long-term, its divine efficacy is immeasurable—
Avoiding worldly calamities,
One is called a **True Person (真人)**.
For cinnabar is the gold,
Thus it is called **Returned Golden Sand (还金砂)**."*

**Ninth Transformation:**
Take the **purified gold sand (飞了金砂)** from the Eighth Transformation,
and mix with **salt (盐)**.
For every *jīn* of gold sand, add eight *liǎng* of **realgar (雄黄)**,
seal tightly, and refine with **civilized and martial fires (文武火)** until complete.
Then, with clean water, wash away the **realgar** and **swallowed salt**,
allowing the gold sand to settle.
**Cai Wenjun** says:
*"Realgar floats lightly upon the water,
While the gold sand, heavy, sinks below."*

Roll into pills the size of **millet grains (黍米大)** with honey.
From the Eighth Transformation’s **purple gold (紫金色)**,
to the Ninth, it turns **vermilion (赤)**—
Thus it is called **Returned Cinnabar (还丹)**.

This elixir **drives away ten thousand ailments**,
and prolonged use **extends life and restores youth**.

**Method to Neutralize Gold Toxicity:**
For every *fū* of mercury to be turned into gold,
or lead/tin likewise,
use **mysterious bright powder (玄明粉)** five *liǎng*,
soaked in three *shēng* of water.
The **Ninth Transformation gold sand (金砂)** is placed in a vessel,
with **gardenia vinegar (栀子醋)** for three *fú* times.
**Mysterious bright powder** neutralizes all combined toxic elixirs,
while **gardenia** captures the volatile essence to stillness.

**Method to Neutralize Fire Toxicity:**
Take one *shēng* of **honey (蜜)**,
mixed with half a *shēng* of clean water,
and simmer for three *fú* times.
Then purify with clear water and settle.

Again, place the **gold sand** in a **five-to-six-layered silk bag (五六重帛，练袋)**,
then wrap it in **layered silk (帛练)**,
submerging it at the bottom of a well—
no fear of any harm.
