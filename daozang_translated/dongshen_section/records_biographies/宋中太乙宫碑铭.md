*Inscription for the Taiyi Palace at Songzhong*
Composed by Minister Lü Huiqing, Gentleman for Court Service, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, Concurrent Reader-in-Waiting, and Supervisor of the Directorate of Education, in reverent compliance with imperial command.

In the fourth year of the Xining reign (1071), the Directorate of Astronomy memorialized that the deity of the Five Blessings of Taiyi, in the seventh year of its cycle—coinciding with the *sheti* year of the *Geti* epoch—would descend to the Central Palace. Its name was the True Chamber, its domain the capital’s hinterland, and its auspice the prosperity of the people and the flourishing of all things. As this heralded an era of great peace, they requested the establishment of a shrine in accordance with precedent. The Son of Heaven approved the memorial and commanded the Directorate of Palace Construction to erect a palace south of the capital. Construction began in the winter of the fourth year and was completed in the spring of the sixth year (1073). The complex comprised three gates and seven halls, with separate shrines for the Ten Taiyi and the Spirit of the Year, while the Five Blessings resided at its center. The emperor personally bestowed names upon them, all signifying the reception of the deities’ repose, and inscribed the name of the True Chamber Hall himself. The four walls of its corridors were adorned with murals depicting the court of the hundred spirits—from the celestial realm of the Five Emperors, sun, moon, and stars, to the terrestrial domain of the Five Peaks and the Four Seas—each occupying its proper rank and title. The hierarchy of vestments, the distinctions of ritual objects, the design of altars and sacred precincts, and the rites of prayer and sacrifice were all grounded in the teachings of Taiyi, supplemented by Daoist doctrine.

The emperor ordered the relevant officials to prepare the ceremonial regalia and, at the winter solstice of the present year, to enshrine the divine images in the palace. He further commanded this minister, Huiqing, to inscribe a stele to record the event.

Your minister, bowing in reverence, reflects upon the *Rites of Zhou: Spring Office*, wherein the Minister of Rites is charged with overseeing the sacrifices to the celestial deities. The most exalted of these is the August Heavenly Thearch, while the humblest extend to the Directors of the Center and Fate, the Masters of Wind and Rain. Scholars, guided by astronomical texts, assign each deity a fixed position. Among the subordinate officials of the Minister of Rites are the *Fengxiang* and *Baozhang* officers, who observe the celestial positions and the terrestrial correspondences of the realm to discern omens. The *Fanshen* officers, who serve the spirits, are versed in the laws of the Three Luminaries, determining the abodes of ghosts and gods, distinguishing their names and attributes, and summoning them. The Grand Invocators are responsible for the six forms of prayer to invoke blessings. Thus, the Minister of Rites oversees the canons of sacrifice, the *Fengxiang* and *Baozhang* officers preside over divination based on celestial changes, the *Fanshen* officers map the dwellings of the spirits, and the Grand Invocators conduct the prayers. Taken together, these are all the duties of the ritual officials.

Though the title *Taiyi* does not appear in the classics, historical records describe its star as lying south of the Celestial Unity in the Purple Palace, identifying it as the spirit of the Heavenly Thearch. It commands sixteen deities, discerning the fortunes and misfortunes of nations. The second star of the Northern Culmen, the brightest and reddest, marks its seat, while the Three Steps serve as the celestial staircase by which Taiyi ascends and descends. Though the astronomers’ accounts of the stars cannot be entirely verified, their theories derive from established traditions, their positions can be precisely located, and their prognostications have often proven accurate. Given the exalted status ascribed to Taiyi, it is evident that the ancient veneration of the supreme celestial deity as Taiyi, assisted by the Five Emperors, and the practice of worshipping it at the suburban altars, was not confined to the local customs of the people of Bo or the institutions of the Han dynasty alone.

As the duties of the ritual officials have since been lost, the divinations of the *Fengxiang* and *Baozhang* officers have devolved into the methods of the Bureau of Astrology. The Daoist depictions of the deities’ images, the distinctions in their vestments and ranks, and the rituals of altars and sacrifices likely preserve the remnants of the *Fanshen* officers’ mapping of the spirits’ abodes and the Grand Invocators’ prayers for blessings. Today, the officials regard the Five Blessings as deities who relocate their palace every forty-five years, traversing the central and four cardinal regions. Roughly every two hundred twenty-five years, they complete a cycle, during which they must pass through the Central Palace. Yet when we examine past records, their correspondences do not always align perfectly. Why is this?

I venture a comparison: celestial timing is like the seasons, while human affairs are like sowing and reaping. Without human effort, even favorable seasons are like timely weather without cultivation—no harvest can be expected. Without celestial timing, even diligent labor is like sowing out of season—no growth can be achieved. The ancients held that Heaven does not accomplish without humanity, nor humanity without Heaven; this is what they meant. Why should we doubt this principle when it comes to Taiyi?

I observe that since ascending the throne, the emperor has reformed governance and education, rectified the bureaucracy, and established laws and institutions in the capital. He has promoted the people’s welfare, extending benefits first to the capital region, then to the educated elite, and ensuring the military is well-provisioned. His efforts have encompassed all things, always prioritizing the four directions. Rain and shine, cold and heat have all been harmonious. False rumors cannot shake his achievements, nor can dissenting opinions exploit his shortcomings. Is this solely the result of human effort? Surely it is also aided by celestial timing. Thus, the protection of the True Chamber may well have manifested here.

During the *Taiping Xingguo* era (976–984), the deity resided in the Yellow Chamber Palace, its domain the lands of Wu and Yue. Emperor Taizong established a shrine in the southeastern suburbs. During the *Tiansheng* era (1023–1032), it resided in the Yellow Court Palace, its domain the lands of Liang and Shu. Emperor Renzong established a shrine in the southwestern suburbs. The intent was that the Son of Heaven regards all under Heaven as his home. If a place lies within the nine provinces and four seas, its blessings are unified—how can there be boundaries of "here" and "there"? Now, as the deity resides in the Central Palace, at the convergence of the four directions, its auspicious repose will extend throughout the four seas, not merely to the emperor’s residence. Should not the means of its realization be all the more expansive?

Then must the emperor extend the benevolence he has already bestowed to those yet untouched, seeking unestablished governance to refine where it has already taken root. Thus, within the bounds of heaven and earth, all shall receive his grace as one; every living thing, plant and creature alike, shall be endowed with life in perfect harmony. At such a time, governance shall reach perfection and rites and music be deliberated; sincerity shall reach its utmost and heaven and earth take heed. One may observe the great and small of all things to discern the subtleties of virtue’s production, and arrange the ranks of the divine by comparing their merits above and below. This is how we bestow blessings upon the common people and align with the decrees of the Three Spirits—its greatest significance.

Yet I, though unworthy, remain in office, my duty bound to classical learning and literary composition. Thus, the praise I owe to such abundant virtue is not merely a trifling matter. And now, the task of composing this inscription has fallen to me—how dare I decline on grounds of inadequacy?

With reverence, I bow my head and kowtow to present this text:

In the primordial chaos, a single qi, the offices of essence silent.
Endless its cycles, boundless its expanse.
Waxing and waning, fullness and void—
who can fathom its depths?

Resplendent in majesty and spirit,
it presides as the Great Unity.
Overseeing the Purple Palace,
its station at the Pole Star.
Descending the three celestial steps,
it surveys the myriad states.
The great ones interpret its signs,
crafting the models of governance.
Tracking its movements and changes,
revealing what lies hidden.
Bestowing auspicious omens, resounding in the nine lands,
it dispenses the Five Blessings.

Traversing the four directions,
passing through the true chambers,
forty-five years—
one palace shifts.
Who shall be its recipient?
Blessing rests upon the virtuous.

Radiant is the Great Song,
its dominion stretching to the nine provinces.
Wise generations succeed one another,
a thousandfold, a hundredfold in fortune.
Accustomed to peace, complacent in governance,
corruption threatens to accumulate.
Then was born one of profound wisdom and sagacity,
arising to set things right.
His governance spread to the four quarters,
first in the capital.
Excess and perversion were suppressed,
ultimately establishing order.
The Five Qi converged,
dissolving decay and eclipse.
Washing away disasters, calming deep afflictions,
the barren earth was enriched.

The coming of the Great Unity—
its approach could be foreseen.
The new palace, grand and resplendent,
was completed in no time.
Modeled after the imperial abode,
adorned in gold and jade-green.
Beneath the Great Unity,
it stands secure and well-settled.
Heaven’s design and human endeavor—
both now fulfilled.
To accomplish and to uphold one’s station—
the duty of sage and worthy.
Gathering the blessings of the times,
bestowing them anew.
Extending to the farthest shores,
equal for all living things.
The two palaces rejoice in longevity,
the empress and consorts chosen with care.
Sons and grandsons, emperors and kings,
shall endure for ten thousand myriad generations.
Rites perfected, music complete,
peace and harmony prevail.

I shall take up my song,
to offer my earnest praise.

The inscription for the Stele of the Central Palace of the Great Unity of the Song is hereby concluded.
