**Preface to *The Record of the Immortal Source at Gan River***

The learning of the Daoist school traces its lineage to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, taking its model from Zhuangzi and Liezi. Yet as later scholars drifted ever farther from the sages, the subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating principles of the great root and great origin—vast, expansive, and boundless—branched into divergent schools, and their transmission was lost. This has been the case for several thousand years.

Now, however, the Dao does not remain forever in decline; it awaits its time to flourish. Our Patriarch Chongyang, endowed with the bearing of a celestial being, arose in an age a hundred generations removed. In the summer of the *jimao* year of the Zhenglong era of the Jin dynasty (1159), he encountered true immortals at Gan River Town in the Zhongnan Mountains. They gave him divine water to drink and bestowed upon him the true oral instructions. From that moment, he severed all karmic ties and worldly entanglements, dwelling in seclusion for three years at Liujiang, Nanshi, and other places to nurture his vast primordial *qi*. Thus, his mind aligned with the supreme Dao.

Later, he journeyed east to the seacoast, where he transmitted the teachings to his eminent disciples—Danyang, Changzhen, Changsheng, Changchun, Yuyang, Taigu, and others—who in turn propagated and transformed the world. Thereupon, men of lofty attainment and enlightened scholars emerged in response to the times. From the imperial capital to the smallest commanderies and towns, magnificent palaces and towering abbeys were established everywhere. The true wind spread far and wide, and the sage’s beneficence extended throughout the realm. Since the dawn of time, the Daoist gate had never known such flourishing as in this era.

Alas! The merit of Patriarch Chongyang and his disciples in the Mysterious Teaching is by no means shallow. Since my youth, I, Daoqian, have dwelt at the ancestral sanctuary of Liujiang in the Zhongnan Mountains, and now fifty years have passed. In the course of my duties for the teaching, I have traveled widely, visiting blessed lands, famous mountains, immortal palaces, and Daoist abbeys. Everywhere, I have witnessed the virtuous deeds of the various masters and the steles and inscriptions commemorating their magnificent achievements. Often, these were composed by the brushes of great scholars, whose works are not easily surpassed even by the finest gold or the rarest jade.

Having recorded what I have seen along the way, I have compiled this book and titled it *The Record of the Immortal Source at Gan River*. I have had it carved and printed for transmission. Should further materials come to light in the future, they may be appended to this work. Thus, the immortal deeds and Daoist practices of the lofty masters of the past may remain ever-present, as if before one’s very seat, for those who come to read and contemplate them. This, too, may be counted among the grand achievements of the Mysterious Teaching.

**Imperial Edicts**

The Emperor proclaims: When the Great Dao shines forth in clarity, it brings about the transformation of non-action; when the Perfect Truth abides in freedom, it ultimately achieves the merit of non-governance. We, having inherited the foundation laid by Our Ancestors, have examined the illustrious ages of the past and deeply admired the Daoist wind. From the remnants of the teachings bestowed by Donghua to the inception of the enlightenment spread by Chongyang, the truth has remained undimmed, transmitted from generation to generation, responsive to all who are moved, reaching even the most distant realms. Though previous dynasties repeatedly bestowed honors and titles, in Our heart, We still find the posthumous veneration insufficient. Thus, We command the scholar-officials to confer additional honorifics.

Donghua, already styled as Imperial Lord, shall have the title augmented with "Purple Palace Lesser Yang." The True Lords of Zhengyang, Chunyang, Haichan, and Chongyang shall be granted the title of *Zhenjun* (Perfected Lord). The Seven Perfected below Danyang shall all be styled *Zhenren* (Perfected One), to be recorded in the annals and transmitted for ten thousand generations.

Alas! In the Han dynasty, Zhang Daoling was granted the title of Heavenly Master, and in the Tang, Ye Fashan was likewise honored—both became enduring glories of the Daoist lineage, met with no dissent in their own times, and later established as fixed precedents. In this, Our admiration may perhaps approach their example.

The Master of the Teachings of Donghua shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Donghua Purple Palace Lesser Yang Imperial Lord*.
The Perfected Lord Zhongli of Zhengyang shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Zhengyang Enlightened Transmitter of the Dao Perfected Lord*.
The Perfected Lord Lü of Chunyang shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Chunyang Expounder of the Orthodox and Admonisher of Transformation Perfected Lord*.
The Perfected Lord Liu of Haichan shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Haichan Illuminated Propagator of the Dao Perfected Lord*.
The Perfected Lord Wang of Chongyang shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Chongyang Perfect Realizer and Opener of Transformation Perfected Lord*.
Master Ma of Danyang shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Danyang Embracer of the One and Abider in Non-Action Perfected One*.
Master Tan of Changzhen shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Changzhen Cloud-and-Water Cultivator of Virtue Perfected One*.
Master Liu of Changsheng shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Changsheng Assistant of Transformation and Illuminator of Virtue Perfected One*.
Master Qiu of Changchun shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Changchun Expounder of the Dao and Master of the Teachings Perfected One*.
Master Wang of Yuyang shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Yuyang Embodying the Mysterious and Broadly Deliverer Perfected One*.
Master Hao Datong of Guangning shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Guangning Master of the Dao Through the Mysterious and the Great Antiquity Perfected One*.
The Dispersed Person Sun Bu’er of Qingjing shall be posthumously enfeoffed as *Qingjing Profoundly Chaste and Cultivator of Virtue Perfected One*.

We command Zhang Zhijing, the *Zhang Daoling* of the Present Age, Perfected One of Illuminated Sincerity and Embodied Dao, to carry out these decrees accordingly.

Respect this.

Written on a day in the first month of the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era.

**Stele Inscription: Stele of the Perfected One Chongyang, Divine Immortal of Zhongnan Mountain and Patriarch of the Quanzhen Teachings**

Composed by Jin Yuantao, Grand Master of the Palace with Concurrent Powers of the Three Dukes, Pillar of State, and Duke of Mi of the Jin Dynasty.

When the imperial destiny unfurls, extraordinary persons must arise.
In the flourishing reign of the Dading era, the Dao attained perfection through the wise and sagely.

The Three Teachings each possess their ultimate words and wondrous principles:
In the Buddhist Teaching, he who grasped the Buddha’s heart was Bodhidharma, and his teaching was named *Chan*;
In the Confucian Teaching, he who transmitted the household learning of Confucius was Zisi, and his work was named *The Doctrine of the Mean*;
In the Daoist Teaching, he who penetrated the ultimate truth of the Five Thousand Words—transmitted without speech, arriving without action—was the Perfected One Chongyang Wang, embodying the Dao of Non-Action and True Constancy of the Most High Lord Lao. His teaching was named *Quanzhen*.

To cast aside illusion and delusion, preserving only one’s true nature—this is the way of divine immortals.

The Perfected One’s given name was *Che*, his courtesy name *Zhiming*. He manifested in Dawei Village of Xianyang.
His immortal mother carried him in her womb for twenty-four months and eighteen days, for he was formed from the surplus *qi* of the twenty-four solar terms, completing the Perfected One.
The Perfected One bore a fine beard, large eyes, and stood over six *chi* and several *cun* in height.
His *qi* was bold, his speech eloquent—by these he won the hearts of the multitude.

The Perfected One’s family was wealthy. He lent grain to the poor, often forgiving half the debt—his compassionate heart was thus faintly revealed. In his youth, he pursued the civil service examinations, enrolling in the capital’s prefectural academy, and also excelled in martial strategy.

When the sagely court sought to reclaim Shaanxi under the *Tianjuan* reign, heroes were summoned to service. The Perfected One then abandoned the literary path to answer the martial examination, changing his name to *Dewei* and his courtesy name to *Shixiong*—his resolve could be discerned.

Yet, as the Dao’s dark threads wove his fate, his accumulated good roots bore fruit: neither his civil nor martial aspirations came to fruition. Thereupon, he sighed deeply and entered the Dao, adopting his present name and courtesy name.

At that time, the Qi regime had collapsed, and the people of Qin remained unsettled. Famine struck, and bandits plundered the Perfected One’s family, leaving nothing. His grandfather reported the theft to the provincial government, which conducted a thorough search among over three hundred neighboring households. Much of the lost gold and silk was recovered, and the ringleaders of the bandits were captured. The Perfected One urged leniency, saying: *"These are but villagers driven by hunger, like those who beg from their neighbors—no true thieves. How could we bear to condemn them to death?"* He released them unharmed. The villagers revered the Perfected One all the more for this.

The two towns of Xianyang and Liquan owed their peace to the Perfected One. Thereafter, he established a separate estate in Liujiang Village on Mount Zhongnan, where he took up residence, neglecting all family affairs. Half-drunk, he chanted aloud:

*"Of old there was Master Pang,
Now there is Wang the Mad."*

From then on, when the villagers saw the Perfected One, they would say, *"The Mad One comes!"*—to which he would readily respond. Thus did he name himself, and thus did others call him.

In the late summer of the *jimao* year of the Zhenglong era (1159), while drunk in Ganhe Town, he ate meat. Two men clad in felt robes arrived at the butcher’s shop shortly after. The two were identical in form and appearance, and the Perfected One, astonished, followed them to a secluded place, where he reverently bowed in prayer. The two immortals spoke slowly, saying, *"This one is teachable."* They then transmitted to him an oral formula. Thereafter, his madness deepened, and he composed a poem:

*"At forty-eight, I first met my fate,
The oral formula brought me power straight."*

The following year, he encountered them again in Liquan and invited them to drink at a tavern. He asked their native place, age, and surname. They replied, *"We are from Pu, twenty-two years of age, but our surname we do not know."* How strange indeed! They left five songs and eulogies, instructing the Perfected One to read them and burn the rest. These writings are recorded in the *Complete Anthology of the Perfect Realization Tradition*.

From then on, he abandoned his wife and children, entrusting his young daughter to her in-laws, saying, *"I have raised this child for another family; do not speak of betrothal rites."* He left them and composed another poem, deliberately using coarse and vulgar language to shame his descendants. Its final lines read:

*"Parting from the earth’s heart brings joy unbound,
Stumbling into Nanjing, the truth is found."*

Later, he took the sobriquet Master Chongyang. In Nanshi Village, he dug a cave chamber to live in, calling it the *"Tomb of the Living Dead."* He later moved to the north of Liujiang Village, where he lodged among the reeds by the water. Whatever he uttered, even in casual speech, became words beyond the mundane. The villagers merely dismissed him as *"the Mad One"* and never inquired into his meaning. When he wandered, he carried a gourd, singing and drinking as he went, never refusing those who begged for a sip. Sometimes, he would draw water from his gourd to give to others, and all marveled at its extraordinary fragrance and purity.

Later, he again met an immortal who fed him divine excrement, whereupon he abstained from wine and drank only water. Yet when people smelled the intoxicating scent from the Perfected One’s mouth and nose, they became drunk themselves.

In the fourth month of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era (1167), he suddenly set fire to his hut. The villagers rushed to save him, only to find the Perfected One dancing wildly at the edge of the flames. His songs and words from that moment are fully recorded elsewhere. He also declared, *"Three years hence, another will come to rebuild this hut."* In a poem he improvised were the lines:

*"The one who rebuilds this hut
Shall never match my free spirit."*

At dawn, he bound his belongings and passed through the pass, carrying an iron pot to beg for alms along the way. He said, *"In the east, I have a companion in green."* In the seventh month, he arrived in Ninghai Prefecture in eastern Shandong. There, a local magnate named Ma Congyi had once dreamed of cranes soaring in the southern garden. Soon after, the Perfected One arrived. Though Ma was not yet fully convinced, the Perfected One built the Perfect Realization Hut at the very spot where the cranes had taken flight. He locked the door for a hundred days, undergoing transformation—sometimes eating, sometimes not, and abstaining from both water and fire.

The hut stood several hundred paces from Ma’s residence, separated by multiple streets. Yet when Ma slept in his upper-floor chamber with all doors and windows secured, the Perfected One would appear at night to converse with him, coming from nowhere. When others tried to capture his likeness, his left eye would turn to the right, his right eye to the left. Sometimes he appeared old, sometimes young; sometimes fat, sometimes thin; his complexion shifting between yellow, red, green, and white. His form and color were ever-changing, defying description.

Ma dreamed that his mother said, *"A guest named Lü Matong has arrived."* He had never told anyone of this dream, yet the next day, the Perfected One addressed Ma as *"Tong."* Another time, Ma dreamed of a carpenter named Zhou who transmitted the Dao to him, bidding him farewell as he prepared to journey to Guanzhong. He took the tonsure and left home, visiting the residence of his clansman, Magistrate Ma. There, he saw the Perfected One seated with a Daoist. A certain Ma Jiuguan sought their teachings. The Perfected One looked at Ma and said, *"Teach Brother Ma in my stead."* Ma then recited a song of over two hundred characters, but upon waking, he remembered only the last few lines:

*"When it turns white through burning,
And yellow through refining,
That is the elixir of immortality, never-dying."*

The next day, the Perfected One bestowed upon Ma the dharma name *Gang* and the sobriquet Master Danyang. In another dream, Ma followed the Perfected One into the mountains. At dawn, the Perfected One called him *"Mountain Pity."*

Such instances of spiritual manifestation and transformation were too numerous to recount. There was a man named Tan who suffered from leprosy and lay near death, begging to become his disciple. The Perfected One gave him the water left from washing his face. After rinsing, Tan’s eyebrows and beard were restored as before, and he suddenly felt the Dao’s clarity and freedom. He was given the name *Chuduan* and the sobriquet Master Changzhen.

Another was Qiu from Qixia County in Dengzhou, who had lost his parents in childhood and never studied. He came to pay respects to the Perfected One, who put him in charge of literary affairs. Thereafter, Qiu could memorize over a thousand characters a day and became skilled in poetry. He was given the name *Chuji* and the sobriquet Master Changchun.

Later, those who wished to become his disciples gathered in great numbers. The Perfected One scolded, beat, and tormented them to temper their resolve, and most scattered and left. Only Ma, Tan, and Qiu truly received his Dao.

In the third month of the eighth year (1168), he excavated a cave on Kunjian Mountain, quarrying stones from the ridge for his use. Unexpectedly, a massive boulder came crashing down, and all who saw it trembled in fear. The Perfected One roared with authority, and the stone halted in its tracks. Woodcutters and gatherers on the mountain, awestruck, bowed from afar. Near and far, all marveled at his divine transformations. Sometimes he ate tiles and stones; other times, he appeared with two heads, sitting in his hut.

When people saw him wandering in the marketplace, they would invite him to eat, and he would foretell what gifts they would bring. His spiritual powers responded to all things, beyond enumeration.

In the eighth month, he moved to Jiang’s Hut in Wendeng, where he took meals at the Zhang family’s home. The children there saw before them agate, amber, pearls, and other treasures, and they clamored to take them, though no one else could see them. In Wendeng, he established the Three Teachings Seven Treasures Society.

In the ninth year of the *jichou* era (1189), during the fourth month, Zhou Botong of Ninghai invited the Perfected One to reside in a hut, which he named the Hall of Golden Lotuses. At night, divine radiance shone as bright as day, leading people to mistake it for a fire. When they drew near, they saw the Perfected One walking within the light. The water in Ninghai was brackish and bitter, but the Perfected One spat into the hut’s well, and to this day, people enjoy its sweet purity. There, he established the Three Teachings Golden Lotus Society. Later, in Fushan County, he founded the Three Teachings Three Lights Society. Upon reaching Dengzhou, he wandered beneath the Penglai Pavilion to observe the sea. Suddenly, a fierce gale arose, and people saw the Perfected One swept by the wind into the waves. Astonished, they cried out, but after a moment, he leapt back onto the shore—only his hairpin and cap were lost. Soon after, they saw him floating gently upon the waves, riding the water’s swell.

Some remarked on the Perfected One’s fine eyes, so he showed them his ailing pupils. Others boasted of his flawless body, so he mounted the steps of the prefectural yamen and defecated. All his inexplicable transformations were of this kind. In Dengzhou, he established the Three Teachings Jade Splendor Society. In Laizhou, he founded the Three Teachings Equality Society. Whenever he established a society, he invariably named it after the Three Teachings—surely this was by design. The Perfected One was perhaps a disciple of Zisi and Bodhidharma, for his emptiness, clarity, subtlety, stillness, and harmonious fusion transcended any single teaching.

Many in Laizhou followed him, but he accepted only Liu Chuxuan, who was styled Master Ever-Living. Liu once composed a poem upon returning from fishing, titled *"Again Seeing the Turtle."* These four disciples—Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—were the ones the world knew. Another time, in the marshes of Ninghai, the Perfected One tossed an oiled umbrella into the air. It soared with the wind and did not fall until it reached the hut of Wang Chuyi on Zha Mountain—over two hundred *li* from where it was thrown. Inside the umbrella’s handle was inscribed the name *Master Yangzi*. Wang, from his youth, had once passed by Xuanting Palace, where a voice from the void admonished and enlightened him. He was now called Master Jade Yang. Across from the Ninghai prefectural office stood the divination stall of the recluse Hao, where the Perfected One sat facing backward. Hao said, "Perfected One, please turn around." The Perfected One replied, "You do not turn around." Then he swept his sleeve and departed. Hao was awakened and followed, becoming the renowned Hao Datong of Guangning.

Ma Gong’s wife, Sun Bu’er, also entered the Dao, having early awakened to the nature of the mind. The world called her the Immortal Lady Sun. After these four eminent disciples, the Perfected One’s followers included three more great adepts.

One day, the Perfected One addressed the assembly: "The time has come. Tomorrow, I depart for the west." His companions begged for a poem, and from dawn till night, he composed:

*"The road ahead does not follow my will,
Clouds and mist summon my true nature’s thrill.
A thousand miles of pure wind ever my guide,
A single bright moon my constant companion’s stride.
Green mountains and blue waters escort me on,
White wine and yellow millet I sip as I’ve gone.
Tonight, if this cup holds meaning true,
Let the red candle’s flame illumine the ice’s hue."*

Before he could lay down his brush, an official surnamed Shi arrived bearing wine, startling the gathering. The Perfected One urged people to recite the *Heart Sutra*, the *Dao De Jing*, the *Scripture of Clarity and Stillness*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*, saying these could aid cultivation.

The next day, he led Ma Gong and the other three disciples straight to Daliang. They lodged at the Wang family’s porcelain shop, where the year’s end approached. Taking leave of the assembly, he said, "I shall return home." They begged him to leave a final verse, and he replied, "I have already written it on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Changle Village, Chang’an." Then he lay down, resting his head on his left arm, and passed away. The crowd wailed in grief, but the Perfected One revived and asked, "Why do you weep?" He then called Ma Gong close and whispered in his ear, instructing him to convert people to the Dao in Guanzhong.

On the fourth day of the first month in the *gengyin* year (1190), he uttered his final verse:

*"The Earth’s Lung bears Master Chongyang,
Whose name is Wang, the Harmful Wind.
He came when days and months were long,
And leaves as west or east may bond.
Clouds and waters keep him company,
Void and emptiness his neighbors be."*

One spirit, the true nature, remains—
not the same as the common crowd.

With the verse complete, he passed away in solemn stillness. Thereafter, Master Ma spread the Dao across the four seas, its teachings flourishing widely.

In the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Emperor Shizong (1188), the *wushen* year, the second month, the court, recognizing the Perfected One’s lofty virtue and wisdom, dispatched envoys to seek his disciples. Those who answered the call were Qiu and Wang. Qiu was appointed to oversee the rites of the Wanchun Festival, holding the esteemed position of High Ritual Master. In the fifth month, he was received at the Pine Isle of Shou’an Palace, where he discoursed on the Supreme Dao. The emperor’s heart was greatly pleased, and he commanded Qiu to reside in the official hermitage. He further ordered statues of the Three Masters—Chunyang, Chongyang, and Danyang—to be sculpted and enshrined in the central hall of the hermitage. Qiu frequently presented poems and songs, all of which are recorded in the *Fanxi Collection*. In the eighth month, he earnestly requested to return to the mountains.

In the sixth month of the *dingsi* year of the Cheng’an era (1207), Emperor Zhangzong summoned Wang Chuyi to the capital and bestowed upon him the title *Tixuan Great Master*, along with a grant to establish a *Xiuzhen* Abbey. In the tenth month, Liu Chuxuan was called to court and appointed to serve at Tianchang Abbey.

From Chongyang, Danyang, and Changchun to all the masters, each left behind literary collections that have been transmitted to the world. Alas! The Perfected One arose in the western lands, his teachings spread throughout Shandong, his Dao filling the heavens, his name resounding to the Son of Heaven. He enlightened later generations, enabling them to wander in perfect freedom—how grand was his achievement!

Fifty-six years after the Perfected One’s passing, his dharma heirs, the two eminent masters Zhenchangzi Li Zhiyuan, Abbot of Jiaxiang Abbey in Bianjing, and Dongzhenzi Yu Shanqing, Abbot of Zhong Taiyi Palace, who earnestly upheld and propagated the ancestral Dao, entreated Lingxuan Jushi, a friend of Yuyangzi, to compose a record. The scholar took up his brush and inscribed this eulogy:

In the lands of Xianyang,
at Great Wey Village,
where mountains and rivers are gentle and fair,
an extraordinary man was born.
In youth, his brilliance shone;
in maturity, he stood apart.
Skilled in discourse and laughter,
masterful in letters,
he also excelled in archery and horsemanship,
his vigor unmatched.
Though learned in civil arts,
he turned his mind to martial pursuits,
resolving to quell strife and chaos—
yet fate did not favor his dual aspirations.
For his past karma destined him:
the qi of the Dao would be his master.
With a sigh, he entered the Way,
and true immortals came to meet him,
instantly imparting secret oral instructions.
Called "Harmful Wind,"
the Perfected One embraced the name.
Now singing, now dancing,
roaming with wine in hand—
Vimalakīrti feigned illness,
Jieyu feigned madness,
yet whatever poured from his lips
became fine literature.
He burned his thatched hut,
swept his sleeves, and left for Guanzhong,
begging alms as he went,
establishing the Complete Perfection Dao in the east.
Through karmic connections in Ninghai,
through harmony in Laiyang,
he displayed wondrous signs,
and all in the east followed.
He refined the true and cast aside the false,
severing all pretense.
Through trials of every kind—
beatings, scoldings, wrath, and abuse—
the base and vulgar scattered.
Four disciples carried forth his teachings.
Who were these four?
Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.
Those of secondary virtue—
Wang, Hao, and Sun—
together formed the Seven Worthies,
glorifying our Perfected One.
Yuyang and Changchun
greatly expanded his gate,
meeting with the sagely court,
becoming guests of the king.
The Perfected One’s noble footsteps
shone like stars and clouds.
Though the ocean’s isles stretch far,
his immortal traces remain.
This Dao flourishes widely,
in perfect freedom, truly so.

*Record of the Immortal Traces of Chongyang the Perfected One of Zhongnan Mountain*
Composed by Liu Zuqian, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Court Consultation, Participant in the Drafting of Imperial Decrees, Superior Grand Master of the Light Chariot, Baron of Pengcheng Commandery, with a fief of seven hundred households, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag.

The teachings of Laozi and Confucius have both spread throughout China, rooted in the Supreme Dao. They encompass all within the six directions, embrace all things from the vast to the minute. The true principle is ever complete, without lack or excess, and cannot be fathomed by shallow understanding. Some, however, dissect the origins of forced names, point to the traces of formed vessels, and engage in mutual rejection—affirming this while negating that—so that the two schools’ doctrines vie for supremacy in the world. They do not realize that there are not two Ways in the world, nor do sages hold two minds. Thus, through accumulated practice and established merit, all methods are built to guide human hearts, leading them to reform and distance themselves from wrongdoing, advancing toward the great realm of harmony. In assisting the governance of emperors and kings, their purpose is one.

The followers of Laozi say, "We treasure compassion and frugality," and further, "We constantly strive to save all beings." This aligns seamlessly with the Confucian sagely emphasis on benevolence and the foundation of righteousness. Now, observing Chongyang the Perfected One of Zhongnan Mountain—who began as a Confucian scholar and ultimately attained the Dao—we see that in guiding beginners, he invariably first had them read the *Classic of Filial Piety* and the *Daodejing*, teaching them filial reverence, sincerity, and purity. In his discourses, he frequently cited the Six Classics as evidence. In Wendeng, Ninghai, and Laizhou, he led his disciples to perform rituals and establish assemblies on five occasions, all to clarify the principles of rectifying the mind, making intentions sincere, reducing selfishness, and curbing desires. He did not adhere to a single form or confine himself to one teaching.

The Master was a native of Xianyang, surnamed Wang, named Gu, styled Zhiming, with Chongyang as his sobriquet. His mother carried him for twenty-four months before his birth. He had a fine beard, eyes longer than his mouth, a stalwart physique, and a forthright, chivalrous nature. In his youth, he studied the classics and was registered in the civil service, while also enrolling in the military selection. At the beginning of the Tianjuan era, he became wealthy and influential in his hometown. When famine struck and many were captured or fled, bandits plundered all his wealth and left. One day, he happened upon the thieves, yet he did not question them. Near and far, he was regarded as a man of virtue.

In the *jimao* year of the Zhenglong era (1159), he suddenly encountered an immortal at Gan River, who saw that he was teachable and secretly transmitted oral instructions, giving him divine water to drink. From then on, he severed all attachments, merging with the dust of the world, feigning madness and filth—people found him increasingly unfathomable. Fearing that the great sound would not enter vulgar ears and that profound words would not resonate with the multitude, he often employed playful, worldly language to make his teachings pleasing and accessible. His transformations and strange discourses took on a thousand forms and ten thousand postures, beyond all inquiry.

Alas! When Jizi feigned madness to preserve the Nine Laws, and Jieyu sang his "Phoenix Song" in madness, their cunning and wisdom—whether inverted or upright—all served to aid the world and establish teachings, each with its own purpose.

Later, the Master dug an underground passage in Nanshi Village, sealing it with a mound several feet high, and inscribed a plaque reading "Tomb of the Living Dead." At each of its four corners, he planted a crabapple tree, declaring, "I shall one day unite the teachings of the four seas into one family." After three years, he filled in the passage himself and moved to Liujiang, where he befriended the two Perfected Ones, He and Li, each building a thatched hut to dwell in.

In the summer of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, he burned down his hut. As people rushed to extinguish the flames, the Master danced gracefully at the fire’s edge, singing to express his intent. At dawn the next day, he set out on his journey, heading straight for Ninghai, where he first met Ma Gang at the Yi Lao Pavilion. Ma, a heroic figure among Confucian scholars, was initially reluctant to acknowledge the Master. Thus, he earnestly requested the Master to reside in a hut, shouldering a carrying pole himself, and for days provided no food. Even when he did offer food, no trace of fire or water was ever seen. At times, the Master would visit Ma at night, appearing from nowhere. When he departed, Ma pursued him in vain—the carrying pole remained as before.

The Master’s teachings manifested in myriad forms—communing with spirits in dreams, parting pears and bestowing chestnuts as signs. From this, Ma began to revere and trust him, and together with his family member Sun, they all took the disciple’s vow. He also gathered seven others, including Tan Chuduan, Liu Chuxuan, Qiu Chuji, Wang Chuyi, and Hao Datong, most of whom were of similar disposition. He bestowed upon Ma the name *Danyang*, Tan *Changzhen*, Liu *Changsheng*, Qiu *Changchun*, Wang *Yuyang*, Hao *Guangning*, and Sun *Qingjing Sanren*, binding them as kin beyond the mundane world.

In the late autumn of the *jichou* year, he left Wang and Hao on Mount Kunlun and returned west with the four disciples. Arriving in Bian, he lodged at the Wang family inn. Before long, he summoned Danyang to impart a secret message, then passed away without illness at the age of fifty-eight. The four disciples escorted his coffin back and buried him beside his former hut in Liujiang. Danyang then built a hut by the grave, which became the ancestral sanctuary of the lineage.

Six years prior, the Master had left a verse on the wall of his hut in Lechun Village, Chang’an:
*"The old ailment of harmful wind strikes again—*
*My lifespan will not exceed fifty-eight."*
Thus it was known that the span of an immortal is ordained, not by chance.

He composed over a thousand poems and lyrics, compiled into the *Complete Perfection Anthology (Front and Rear Collections)* and transmitted to the world. The elder Hu Guangqian of Yufeng wrote his biography.

After Danyang succeeded the teaching, his followers multiplied, and his disciples spread across the land. When Danyang returned east, Changchun extensively renovated the former hut in Liujiang. Yuyang later petitioned for an inscribed plaque, naming it *Lingxu Abbey*. From then on, those who assumed its abbacy first received ordination as Daoists to tend the incense and flame.

Emperor Shizong, who had long admired his reputation, once dispatched envoys to seek him out. In the spring of the *wushen* year, Changchun and Yuyang answered the summons to the capital, where they were granted caps, sashes, and robes and commanded to reside at *Tianchang Abbey*. Soon after, they were summoned to the northern palace on *Changsong Isle*. Delighted by their discourse, the emperor ordered an official hut built for them on the island’s west side.

During the *Chengan* and *Taihe* eras, Emperor Daoling repeatedly summoned Yuyang and Changsheng to the palace, granting them residence at *Xiuzhen Abbey* to await further audiences. Yuyang was honored with the title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. The poetic works of Danyang and his successors were each compiled into collections, while Hao Guangning’s profound mastery of the *Book of Changes* is fully preserved in the *Taigu Anthology*.

In the early years of the *Zhengda* era, the Prince of Mi cast an encomium:
*"The Way of Complete Perfection came east,*
*Four disciples spread its transformation.*
*Who were these four?*
*Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.*
*Their next in virtue—*
*Wang, Hao, and Sun—*
*Together the Seven Worthies,*
*Extolled as my perfected ones.*
*Yuyang and Changchun,*
*Greatly opened its gate,*
*Met by the sagely court,*
*As guests of the king.*
*The boundless sea stretches far,*
*Yet the immortals’ traces remain.*
*Studying this praise,*
*Their master-disciple Way and work are plain to see."*

At the time, I was serving in the Hanlin Academy and befriended the *Zhixu* Grand Master Li Zhiyuan, abbot of Jiaxiang Abbey, and the *Chongxu* Grand Master Yu Shanqing, abbot of Zhong Taiyi Palace, along with the *Wuyu* Master Li Zhichang, as companions beyond the world. They requested this humble account to record the immortal traces of Chongyang.

In past years, while stationed near Lingxu Abbey in Eting, I had long heard of the Master’s true wind. Thus, I set down this account so that later scholars might know the origins and deeds of the Master, whose transformative influence upon the world was so vast, and thereby examine and propagate his teachings.

As for his miraculous feats—entering dreams, tossing umbrellas, casting off caps, or other displays of soaring and vanishing—these were but expedient arts, not the essence of his teaching. Those who seek the great Dao should not be ensnared by such minor skills. This is not to be dismissed out of narrow-mindedness.

Respectfully recorded on the Double Ninth of the first year of the *Tianxing* era.

*Record of the Perfected Ma Danyang’s Ascension*
Composed by Zhang Ziyi of the Prefecture

The Perfected was an extraordinary figure in the world, endowed with the bearing of a celestial immortal and born to fulfill the appointed destiny. Wise, astute, pure, and magnanimous, his learning encompassed the Six Arts, and his conduct embodied the Nine Virtues. His capacity was vast, his spirit unbounded—far beyond the reach of ordinary men.

Yet he dwelled in humble abodes, refusing to seek office for mere stipends. He delighted in poetry and wine, content in joy and indifferent to worldly affairs. One day, the Perfected Chongyang arrived from the west and transmitted secret instructions. In an instant, he awakened, regarding wife and children as discarded sandals. He then relinquished his thousand-tael estate to wander as clouds upon the water.

He entered the Pass from Luoyang and built a hut beneath Taiyi, where he cultivated true practice and accumulated true conduct. Clad in paper and hemp, he ate oyster-shell gruel. In the depths of winter’s bitter cold, he bared his body and feet, yet remained untroubled, his will fixed solely upon the Dao. For years, he never accepted a single coin from others.

His words flowed into verse, his utterances like scattered pearls, numbering in the thousands. All revealed profound mysteries, resonating with the subtle essence of *xi* and *yi*, and spread across the land, recited by all. In stilling his mind and stabilizing his nature, he was pure and serene; in guiding others, he was compassionate and kind. Thus, people near and far flocked to his influence, and scholars and officials vied to revere and befriend him.

At that time, Liu Gongxianwu of Yongtai, the transport commissioner of Jingzhao, met the Perfected and felt an instant kinship, as if they had known each other for lifetimes. After his duties, he would engage in unhurried conversation, finding deep accord, often vowing to one day join him as a guest in Penglai. Before long, the Perfected set out for his homeland. As they parted, Liu was overcome with sorrow.

Upon reaching the east, the crowds from three prefectures and five assemblies surged forth like clouds, their joy and reverence as if beholding a beloved father. They raised yellow banners, earnestly entreating him to stay, that he might serve as their guide to salvation.

In the intercalary winter of the *guimao* year, he accepted an invitation to Laiyang and lodged in the *Huan Hut* of *Youxian Abbey*. Before his seat had grown warm, he suddenly attained the true.

The following summer, in the sixth month, Magistrate Liu Xianwu arrived to govern this district. Upon dismounting his carriage, he learned that the Perfected had attained the true here, and immediately hastened to the sacred bier. Prostrating himself in tears, he was overcome with grief. Gradually, he addressed the assembly of Daoists: "When the Perfected ascended, did he leave no final teachings? You must tell me everything."

The next day, Cao Xu and Liu Zhenyi presented the Perfected’s posthumous traces. They also briefly established a hut beside his tomb, which is now the ancestral sanctuary. Earlier, six years prior, the Master had left an inscription on the wall of the *Le Village Hut* in Chang’an:

*"The harming wind, the harming wind—my old illness flares,*
*My lifespan will not exceed fifty-eight."*

Thus it was known that his celestial years were destined, not by chance. His poems and lyrics, numbering over a thousand, were compiled into the *Complete Works of Quanzhen: Earlier and Later Collections* and transmitted to the world. The Elder of Jade Peak, Hu Guangqian, composed his biography.

When Master Danyang succeeded to the teaching, his followers multiplied, and his disciples soon filled the realm. After Danyang’s return to the east, Changchun extensively renovated the old hut of Liu and Jiang. Yuyang then requested an inscribed plaque for it, naming it *Lingxu Abbey*. From then on, those who assumed its abbacy first received ordination as Daoists to maintain its incense and flame.

Emperor Shizong, who had long revered his name, once dispatched envoys to seek him out. In the spring of the *wushen* year, Changchun and Yuyang answered the summons to the capital. The emperor bestowed upon them caps, sashes, and robes, and commanded them to reside at *Tianchang Abbey*. Soon after, he summoned them to *Northern Palace’s Long Pine Isle*, where their conversation delighted him. He ordered an official hut built on the isle’s western shore for their dwelling.

During the *Chengan* and *Taihe* reigns, Emperor Daoling repeatedly summoned Yuyang and Changsheng to the palace, granting them residence at *Xiuzhen Abbey* to await his summons. Yuyang received the title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. From Danyang onward, the poetic works of each master were compiled into collections. Hao Guangning alone delved deeply into the *Yijing*, as fully recorded in the *Taigu Anthology*.

In the early years of the *Zhengda* era, the Duke of Mi cast an encomium:

*"The Quanzhen Way arose in the east,*
*Four masters transmitted its transformation.*
*Who were these four?*
*Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.*
*Those of secondary virtue—*
*Wang, Hao, and Sun—*
*Together formed the Seven Worthies,*
*Who praised our Perfected.*
*Yuyang and Changchun,*
*Greatly opened its gate,*
*Encountering a sagely dynasty,*
*And became the king’s guests.*
*The vast sea stretches far,*
*Yet the immortals’ traces remain.*
*Studying this encomium,*
*Their master-disciple Dao and its achievements may be glimpsed."*

At the time, I was serving in the Hanlin Academy. I befriended Master Zhongxu of *Jiaxiang Abbey*, Li Zhiyuan, and Master Chongxu of *Zhong Taiyi Palace*, Yu Shanqing, as well as the *Desireless One*, Li Zhichang—all companions beyond the world. They requested this humble account to record the immortal traces of Chongyang.

In past years, while serving in Eting, I had lodged near *Lingxu Abbey* and long heard of the Perfected’s virtuous wind. Thus, I set forth this account so that later scholars might know the Master’s origins and deeds, and how his transformative power extended so widely to all things. They may then examine, observe, and carry it forward.

As for his divine manifestations—entering dreams, casting aside umbrellas and caps, or other feats of soaring, vanishing, and concealment—these were but expedient arts, not the essence of his teaching. Those who seek the great Dao should not be ensnared by such minor techniques. This is not to be dismissed out of narrow-mindedness.

Respectfully recorded on the Chongyang Festival of the first year of the *Tianxing* era.

*Record of the Perfected’s Attainment by Master Danyang Ma*
Composed by Zhang Ziyi, a native of the district

The Perfected was an extraordinary figure in his generation. Endowed with the bearing of a celestial immortal and aligned with the appointed destiny of the era, he was wise, perceptive, pure, and magnanimous. His learning encompassed the Six Arts, and his conduct embodied the Nine Virtues. His capacity was vast, his spirit expansive—far beyond the reach of ordinary men.

Yet he dwelled in humble obscurity, refusing to seek office for mere stipends. He delighted in poetry and wine, content in his joy and indifferent to worldly affairs. One day, Perfected Chongyang arrived from the west and transmitted secret instructions to him. In an instant, he awakened, regarding wife and children as discarded sandals. Thereupon, he relinquished his thousand *jin* of property and joined the wandering life of water and clouds.

He welcomed the Luo River’s flow into the Pass and built a hut beneath the *Taiyi* peak. There, he cultivated true attainment and accumulated virtuous practice, wearing robes of paper and hemp, subsisting on oyster-shell gruel. In the depths of winter’s bitter cold, he bared his body and exposed his feet, yet remained untroubled, his will fixed solely on the Dao. For years, he never accepted a single coin from others.

His words flowed effortlessly into verse, his every utterance a string of pearls. His thousands of poems and lyrics, all expounding the profound and obscure, resonated with the subtleties of the *Xiyi*’s realm. Disseminated far and wide, they were recited by all. In stilling his mind and stabilizing his nature, he was pure, empty, and serene. In guiding others, he was compassionate, kind, and harmonious. Thus, from near and far, people flocked to his virtuous influence, and scholar-officials vied to revere and befriend him as their teacher.

At that time, Liu Xianwu, Magistrate of Jindao, held the post of *Yun’gou*. Upon meeting the Perfected, they felt an instant kinship, as if they had known each other for lifetimes. After his duties, he would engage in unhurried conversation, finding deep accord, often vowing to one day join him as a guest in Penglai. Before long, the Perfected set out for his homeland. As they parted, Liu was overcome with sorrow.

Upon reaching the east, the crowds from three prefectures and five assemblies surged forth like clouds, their joy and reverence as if beholding a beloved father. They raised yellow banners, earnestly entreating him to stay, that he might serve as their guide to salvation.

In the intercalary winter of the *guimao* year, he accepted an invitation to Laiyang and lodged in the *Huan Hut* of *Youxian Abbey*. Before his seat had grown warm, he suddenly attained the true.

The following summer, in the sixth month, Magistrate Liu Xianwu arrived to govern this district. Upon dismounting his carriage, he learned that the Perfected had attained the true here. He immediately hastened to the sacred bier, prostrating himself in tears, overwhelmed with grief. Gradually, he addressed the assembly of Daoists: "When the Perfected ascended, did he leave no final teachings?" The next day, Cao Xu and Liu Zhenyi presented the Perfected’s posthumous traces, adding: "Our late Master, in the last month of winter, after the full moon, suddenly revealed his intent to return to the true."

Seven days later, on the *guiwei* day, it chanced to be the birthday of the Perfected of Chongyang. As the offerings were being arrayed, at the first watch of the night, a sudden peal of thunder resounded. Then came the voice of the Perfected of Chongyang, saying: "Your time for transcendence has come—you ought not linger long." By midnight, he lay upon his left arm and passed away.

Thereafter, his spirit journeyed to the home of Guo Fuzhong, the Wine Inspector, where he left a twenty-character verse, adding that none in this world had recognized its meaning, though the ink traces remained. He then proceeded to the residence of Liu Xi, where he inscribed another quatrain, speaking of "wind-borne steeds ascending to immortality." As for the auspicious omens of yellow registers in our district and the miraculous manifestation of the Perfected’s visage at Penglai—such numinous manifestations were too numerous to recount in full.

Magistrate Liu sighed deeply and said: "How extraordinary! The Perfected’s deeds and traces were so divinely wondrous—rare even in recent ages. If they are not engraved upon jade and transmitted to posterity, it would truly be a pity. What do you propose to do?"

The disciples replied: "We are unworthy and incapable of conveying even a fraction of our Master’s merits and conduct. To do so would be a grave transgression."

I, though unworthy, have heard the ancients say: "A common scholar, unattached to lofty ranks, how can his name be known to later generations?" Today, by good fortune, we have encountered Your Excellency—could this not be due to karmic affinity from a former life?"

The Magistrate said: "I heed your words." He then summoned the townsman Zhang Ziyi and said: "The transcendent traces of Master Danyang’s ascension—I shall have them carved in stone to endure forever. I have heard you have long frequented the gate of the Perfect Realization tradition. You shall record this for me."

Zhang Ziyi, accepting the command with trepidation, prostrated himself in gratitude, protesting: "My mediocre talents are unworthy of such a weighty commission. I beg you to choose someone more capable."

The Magistrate said: "Do not decline further." Thus, Zhang Ziyi dared not refuse again. Reflecting deeply, he spoke:

"In former times, when Cao Can of the Western Capital came to serve as Chancellor of Qi, he summoned all the elders to inquire how best to pacify and govern the people. Yet each gave differing advice, and none could be settled upon. Hearing that Master Gai of Jiaoxi was skilled in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he sent envoys with generous gifts to invite him. Upon meeting, Master Gai expounded that the essence of governance lay in clarity and quiescence, so that the people would naturally be at peace. He elaborated on this principle in full. Thereupon, Cao Can yielded the main hall to house Master Gai. In governing, he adhered to the Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and thus served as Chancellor of Qi for nine years, bringing peace and stability to the state, earning renown as a sagacious minister.

Now, when our Magistrate Liu Xianwu came to govern this district, though his sojourn was brief, he wielded the blade of a butcher to slay a fowl. Within a month of assuming office, the entire jurisdiction was well-ordered. Those who had suffered wrongs and had no recourse found their grievances redressed; the cunning and wicked had no means to perpetrate their evils. The people all rested securely in his blessings. Moreover, his integrity and impartiality left no room for private gain—even the governance of Zhongkang Lu in Zhongmou or Ximen Bao in Ye could not surpass him.

Laiyang has long been a troubled county, deemed difficult to govern. Yet now, no unresolved matters linger in the court, and his days are filled with leisure. He has invited Daoist assemblies—masters such as Yuyangzi of Tiezha Mountain—and seated them in the hall of ease, discoursing on the Dao and virtue, exploring the roots of clarity and non-action, and delving into the arts of cultivating the true and nurturing nature. The halls and chambers are serene, and one scarcely senses the presence of an official. When the gatherings disperse, he resumes his duties as before, laboring from dawn to dusk without weariness.

Though the Magistrate’s talents are exceptional and his decisions swift as flowing water, the Dao of clarity and quiescence has surely aided him. From this perspective, how does his reverence for Master Gai differ from that of Cao Can? Moreover, his colleagues are all worthy men of their time, working in harmony to support and perfect his virtuous governance. The Registrar, Jiagu Zhaoxin, and the Tax Officer, Zhu Gou, have ensured no household has outstanding taxes. The Marshal, Pu Cha Wugong, wields his authority with such might that bandits flee to other regions, bringing peace to the entire district without disturbance. The efficacy of his governance and transformation has spread far and wide, and none near or distant do not revere his virtuous administration.

Furthermore, when the Magistrate served as an aide in the Capital’s Logistics Bureau, his affinity with the Perfected’s Dao grew ever deeper, as previously noted. Now that the Perfected has attained the true in Laiyang, and the Magistrate has again been appointed to govern this district, he, along with his colleagues, has specially commissioned the erection of a stele with inscribed text to be transmitted endlessly, thereby glorifying the teachings of the Perfect Realization tradition and bringing them to fruition in this later age.

Observing the karmic causes of their initial and subsequent encounters, it is indeed a great fortune—one beyond the reach of mere human effort. Though unworthy, I have gathered the facts of their meeting and recorded them here.

Respectfully inscribed on the fifteenth day of the first month of the *yisi* year of the Dading reign [1185].

**Stele Commemorating the Merits and Conduct of the Second Generation Perfected of the Perfect Realization Tradition, Master Danyang Baoyi Wuwei Ma**

Composed by Wang Liyong, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Court Service, and Vice Surveillance Commissioner of the Shaanxi-Hanzhong Circuit

Heaven and Earth are non-active yet perfect the Dao;
The utmost person awakens to the Dao to perfect the true.
Vast and simple, without trace,
They give life and begin all things yet cannot be named.

When the Dao is perfected within, is it not Heaven and Earth?
Expansion and contraction, growth and decline—its transformations are unfathomable.
When virtue participates in transformation and nurturing, it must reach its ultimate.
When the true is perfected within, is it not the utmost person?

Master Danyang Ma manifested a golden lotus in the Eastern Sea,
Rooted the mysterious teachings in Chongyang.
His traces arose during the flourishing age of the Jin dynasty,
His lineage flowed forth at the founding of our Great Yuan.

No different from Guangcheng, who revealed the Dao in high antiquity,
Or Hunyuan, who transmitted teachings in the Zhou dynasty,
Or Chongxu and Nanhua, who established their words in the Warring States era.

The Master’s personal name was Congyi, his courtesy name Yifu. His family had long pursued Confucian scholarship and traced its lineage to Fufeng in the Capital District, descending from Ma Yuan, the General Who Pacified the Waves of the Han dynasty. During the military chaos of the Five Dynasties, they migrated east to Ninghai and settled there. His grandfather, Jue, styled Cuisou, was renowned for his filial piety. His father, Shi Yang, styled Xixian, was dignified in bearing, reticent yet measured. In serving his parents and pursuing learning, he fully embodied his father’s virtues."

At times, a guest would flee in alarm, leaving behind a bundle of fine cloth at the household, which upon inspection was found to contain gold. Shi Yang reported this to his father and stored it away to await the guest’s return. Ten days later, the guest arrived and was promptly given the gold. The guest expressed his gratitude, saying, “I am Lü the Immortal. I dwell in Yougu Village, where I make my living by panning and mining. I had saved two *yi* of gold to purchase ritual offerings in the market, but was pressed by tax inspectors. Thanks to you, I escaped their clutches. I wish to split the gold with you as repayment.” Xixian firmly declined. Lü said, “You possess the noble integrity of one who turns toward the wind. A lofty scholar will emerge from your line.” Later, when Xixian visited Yougu Village, no one bore the surname Lü, and he then realized the guest had been an extraordinary being.

When the Master was about to be born, his mother, née Tang, dreamed of the goddess Magu presenting her with a cinnabar pellet. She swallowed it and awoke in an auspicious glow. It was the twentieth day of the fifth month in the first year of the Jintianhui reign (1123), a *guimao* year. The Master had four brothers, and their names were bestowed according to the virtues of *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (propriety), *zhi* (wisdom), and *xin* (trustworthiness), hence the sobriquet “the Five Constants of the Ma clan.” The Master was the second son. As a child, he often recited phrases about riding clouds and mounting cranes. In adulthood, he excelled in literature but showed no interest in seeking official advancement.

At the time, Li Wumeng was refining the Great Elixir on Kunjian Mountain, a task that had occupied him for nearly three years. He declared that the elixir would only be completed upon the arrival of an immortal. One day, the Master wandered near the mountain, and Wumeng, upon seeing him, regarded him with astonishment. “This youth bears the Three Mountains upon his brow and his hands hang past his knees—truly, he possesses the marks of a great immortal.” He then composed a eulogy for him:

*His form is majestic, his face round, his ears long,
His brows refined, his eyes bright, his nose straight, his mouth square.
His features are perfectly endowed; a divine radiance crowns his head.
Yifu, you are destined for transcendence—together we shall tread Penglai and Zhuang’s realm.*

Soon after, the elixir was indeed completed. Sun Zhongxian, admiring the Master’s talent and virtue, betrothed his daughter to him. They had three sons: Tingzhen, Tingrui, and Tinggui.

The Master once sat for the prefectural examination. One night, he dreamed of two men clad in coarse hempen robes. One, with patches on both shoulders, knelt before him weeping, saying, “Over a hundred thousand lives depend on you, my lord.” With that, they departed. The Master pursued them, only to see them enter the pen of Liu Qing, a butcher.

On the wall were inscribed these words:
*"We, a hundred thousand of the Ji-Hai year,
More than half perished in the Xin-Si slaughter.
If this gate shows no mercy,
For generations, we shall cling to the axle’s grind, bound in suffering."*

Awakening, he heard the sounds of butchery. Going to look, he saw the son of Liu Qing—A Ze—slaughtering two pigs. One bore a white mark on its shoulder. He sought to stop it, but it was too late. Then he understood: these were the Ji-Hai pigs, and Xin-Si was the year of Qing’s zodiac.

He went to the guardsman Sun Ziyuan to divine the matter and resolve his confusion, also inquiring about his lifespan. Sun said, “Your life will not exceed forty-nine years.” The Master sighed, “Life and death are not in man’s hands—how much better to follow the Dao and seek longevity.”

Later, while playing chess with a guest, he suddenly exclaimed, “This move is well played—now I shall not die!” In the autumn of the seventh year of the Dading era (Ding-Hai), the Master drank with Gao Jucai and Master Zhan at the *Yi Lao* Pavilion of Fan Mingshu. Wine flowed freely, and he composed a poem:
*"Embracing the One and guarding unity—this is the work,
Yet even lazy men now lack such skill.
All day, the cup lifts the spirit,
And in drunkenness, someone supports me."*

After the Mid-Autumn festival, they met again. Master Chongyang joined their gathering, and Master Zhan asked, “Why have you come in hempen robes and bamboo hat, braving the heat with such diligence?” He replied, “An old pact with immortals brings me here to pay my respects.” When offered melon, he ate from the stem, and when asked why, he said, “Sweetness comes from bitterness.” Again he was asked, “Whence do you come?” He answered, “From Mount Zhongnan, three thousand li away, I come to aid the drunken man.”

The Master thought to himself: *In my earlier poem, I spoke of someone supporting me in drunkenness—how does this man know?* He asked his name, and the reply was, “Dao.” The Master said, “Where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born.” Their discourse on the Dao aligned closely, so he invited Chongyang to stay at his private residence. There, he showed sixteen *Luohan Songs* he had written. Chongyang composed matching verses, as if they had been composed long before. Thus, the Master submitted in reverence and took him as his teacher.

Earlier, the Master had dreamed of a crane emerging from the earth of the southern garden. Now, when he wished to build a hut for Chongyang, the Master pointed to the very spot where the crane had appeared. The Master marveled at this. The hut was built and named *Quan Zhen* (“Perfect Realization”).

The Master wished to travel west with Chongyang, but his burdens were too heavy to permit it. Chongyang then extolled the joys of leaving home and wandering far to ease his mind. On the first day of the tenth month that year, Chongyang instructed the Master to lock himself in the hut for a hundred-day retreat, eating but one meal a day. Though it was the depths of winter, he had only brush, inkstone, a mat, coarse clothes, and straw sandals. Yet his form and spirit harmonized, as if spring had returned to a frozen valley.

In the eighth year, on the eleventh day of the first month, the hut was unlocked. Chongyang said to the Master, “I thought you would follow me west in a few days, but you locked yourself away for a hundred days—what a strange turn!” The Master understood. He entrusted his property to Tingzhen and his brothers, gave a letter of parting to the Sun family, and then changed into Daoist robes.

Chongyang, recalling the lines from the Master’s dream—*“Burn it white, refine it yellow, / This is the elixir of long life and deathlessness”*—renamed him *Gang* (“Crucible”), styled him *Xuanbao* (“Mysterious Treasure”), and gave him the sobriquet *Danyangzi* (“Master of Cinnabar Yang”).

The Master then dreamed of following Chongyang into the mountains. At dawn, Chongyang called him *Shan Tong* (“Mountain Pity”), and this became his childhood name. They dwelled in the Misty Grotto of Kun Jian. Suddenly, the Master suffered a splitting headache, as if there were no escape. Chongyang ordered him treated at home. One day, he said to his disciples, “Yesterday, Master Ma drank wine—has he broken the Dao?” They went to check, and indeed, the Master had used wine as a medicinal catalyst, unknowingly overindulging. His illness worsened, and people said, “Master Ma is dying.” Chongyang clapped his hands and sighed, “I sought a distant friend of the Dao, yet his faith was not steadfast—how has it come to this?” He then healed him with words of refining the heart: “To enter the Dao, one must renounce wine, lust, wealth, and anger, along with attachments, loves, worries, and anxieties—there is no better medicine.” The illness soon passed.

In the tenth month of that year, Chongyang ordered the Master to burn his oath at the Su family hut in Wendeng. The Master followed Chongyang to Bian, lodging at the Wang family inn. Chongyang revealed the mysteries of immortality in all matters of eating, drinking, and daily life. After long tempering, the Master received the secret transmission.

In the tenth year, on the fourth day of the first month, Chongyang was about to ascend. The Master pleaded, “Let Gang serve you as your disciple.” Chongyang said, “Go to the former residence of Liu and Jiang in Zhongnan.” With these final instructions, he departed.

The Master, along with Daoist friends Tan, Liu, and Qiu, entered the pass to pay respects to the Perfected Ones He and Li. They went to the ancestral hut of Liu and Jiang and took up residence. In the twelfth year of spring, he spontaneously produced coins in the Chang’an marketplace, then escorted Chongyang’s immortal coffin from Bian to Qin for burial at the Liu-Jiang site, fulfilling his teacher’s last command.

While keeping vigil at the hut, the Master wore his hair in three topknots. The three topknots represented the three auspicious characters of Chongyang’s taboo name. In the autumn of the fourteenth year, on an evening at the Zhenwu Temple in Qin Du Town, the Master and his three Daoist friends discussed their aspirations. The Master said, “I fight poverty.” Tan said, “I fight *this* [the present].” Liu said, “I fight will.” Qiu said, “I fight idleness.” The next day, they parted. The Master returned to Liu-Jiang and built a spacious courtyard as a communal dwelling, inscribing *“The Heart Dies in the Ancestral Court”* to name it. From then on, the hut was called the *Ancestral Court*.

The Master asked his disciples, “How many hours are there in a day and night?” They replied, “Twelve.” He said, “In these twelve hours, does the celestial work of creation ever pause?” They answered, “No.” The Master said, “So too must those who study the Dao be.”

In the eighteenth year, the Master sought to convert Liu Zhaoxin and Li Dacheng of Huating, but his efforts were unsuccessful. He then composed a poem:

*"The brocaded kylin cannot but shed tears in vain,
Gathering my fishing rod, I return."*

Dacheng suddenly awakened and, paying homage as a disciple, received the name *Lingyangzi*. In the first month of spring in the nineteenth year, the Master built a circular garden in Huating, with Dacheng assisting. Outside the wall stood a withered tree, long dead. On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, it was transplanted within the garden and watered. The Master said, *"Today is the birthday of Pure Yang. I was born on the twentieth day of the fifth month."* By that day, the tree had sprouted leaves. He then composed a verse:

*"Thirty-six above the heavens,
Thirty-six below the earth,
Heaven and earth enter the precious vase,
And the seventy-two seasonal nodes are complete."*

Dacheng asked for an explanation. The Master replied, *"This is a hidden saying; its fulfillment will come in time."* When the appointed day arrived, the tree flourished with green leaves. Only then did they realize that from the day of transplanting to the twentieth day of the fifth month spanned thirty-six days—day and night together making seventy-two nodes. Dacheng thus wrote *Record of the Strange Tree* to commemorate the event.

In the eighth month of autumn, the Master moved to Youde Abbey in Longzhou. Jieyuan Li Zihe and others wished to follow with their canes and staffs, and over a hundred more soon abandoned the secular world to join the Dao. In the spring of the twentieth year, he returned east to the *Ancestral Court*. Passing through Chang’an, he stayed at Penglai Hut at the invitation of his virtuous friend Zhao En.

In the eighth month of autumn, a drought struck. The Master composed a prayer for rain:

*"When will one plow receive enough moisture?
Five times five does not exceed twenty-five."*

On that very day, rain fell.

In the winter of the twenty-first year, the Master asked his disciple Lai Lingyu, *"What is it called when old and tattered garments are taken apart, washed, and made anew?"* Lingyu replied, *"Unpicking and washing."* The Master said, *"The teachings of the Eastern School have grown old and corrupted over the years. I shall go to unpick and wash them."* Before ten days had passed, an official dispatch arrived, and he entrusted the affairs of the Guanzhong teachings to Qiu Changchun as overseer. Then, with his immortal retinue, he returned east.

Passing through Jinan, a man named Han Taoqingfu—who admired Shao Kangjie’s character and named his residence *Garden of Peace and Joy*—paid homage to the Master and begged for instruction. The Master said, *"The Dao takes non-attachment as its essence, silence as its function, softness as its root, and purity as its foundation. Regulate your diet, cut off idle thoughts, sit in stillness to harmonize your breath, and rest peacefully to cultivate your qi. When the mind does not wander, the nature is settled; when the body is not wearied, the essence is preserved; when the spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then, extinguish passions in emptiness, pacify the spirit in quiescence, and without leaving your courtyard, the wondrous Dao is attained."*

Tao bowed in gratitude and said, *"The great Dao is vast and formless, with no handle to grasp. Today, hearing these profound words, I have found the gate and entered."*

The Master often spoke of the four applications of the body: *"When walking, place your feet on level ground; when standing, concentrate your spirit in the great void; when sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of your nose; when lying down, embrace the pearl below your navel."* Such teachings were many, for they concerned the proper duties of a Daoist.

In the fourth month of summer in the twenty-second year, he arrived in Ninghai. Soon after, he traveled to Qibao Hut in Wendeng. His disciples dug a well nine feet deep, but a great stone blocked their way. The Master said, *"Dig two feet deeper, and sweet springs will naturally respond with clear murmurs."* When they had excavated one foot and eight inches, the spring gushed forth.

On the last day of the twelfth month in winter, the Master told his disciples, *"Today brings extraordinary joy."* He then sang and danced in delight. In the first month of spring in the twenty-third year, word came that the immortal lady Sun Bu’er had returned to truth in Luoyang.

On the Lower Prime Day of the tenth month in winter, Magistrate Ni Li Guwu of Wendeng invited the Master to perform the *Nine Darks Ritual*. The Master said to Yao Xuan and Lai Lingyu, *"A voice from the void announces the arrival of the Patriarch: a green turban and white robe, seated on a white tortoise atop a green lotus leaf. The tortoise drags its tail, visible in the clouds above."* Daoists and laypeople, struck with awe, burned incense and bowed in reverence.

Shortly after, he turned his head, lay on his side, and departed toward the southeast.

In the twelfth month, the Master traveled to Youxian Abbey in Laiyang. Suddenly, he took up his brush and wrote the *Hymn of Surrendering Form*, the gist of which read: *"Great is the ascent to truth! The path leads into the azure void. Unicorns follow the crimson banners; phoenixes trail vermilion tassels. Jade pendants chime as he rides the void and treads the clouds. Receiving the true revelations, he ascends to the jade celestial sphere—this merely hints at his return to truth."*

On the twenty-second day of that month, the Patriarch’s birthday, the Master gazed up at the heavens. Cao Xu asked why, and he replied, *"The Patriarch has arrived with Master He, my uncle. I must attend the immortal assembly."* Yu Zhiyi said, *"The teaching is vast and grand—why not show mercy and leave none behind?"* The Master answered, *"I depart in full dignity, to become a joyous immortal."* To Liu Zhenyi, he said, *"If you wish to become immortals, you must accumulate merit and deeds. Even amid a thousand trials and a hundred hardships, never falter. If you persist, you will know my words are not false."* He added, *"With eyes open, I see; with eyes closed, I see. The seeing does not lie in the eyes—it is the heart that perceives all clearly. You, Lü, are in the north; you may go now."*

As the second watch neared, the Master bound his hair, rested his head on his arm, and shed his mortal form. That night, on the wall of Liu Xi’s chamber, he left a verse:

*Within the Three Yangs’ convergence, merit is complete,*
*Wind-borne steed rides the breeze—an immortal is made.*
*I urge you to subdue dragon and tiger,*
*Then naturally you too shall ascend to heaven.*

Moments later, word spread that the Master had become an immortal. Only then did they realize the inscribed verse was the work of his spirit.

Earlier, at Zihua Hermitage on Zijin Mountain in Kunqian, several pines had turned from green to white. The Master remarked, *"The whitening of the pines—is this not for me?"* Within half a year, he indeed passed away. Masters Changsheng and Yuyang of the two lineages arrived to manage his funeral rites. After seven days, they selected a burial site at Youxian Abbey and interred him there.

In the twenty-fifth year, townsfolk suspected that disciples from the Shaanxi region had stolen his immortal remains. Magistrate Liu Jie of Laiyang, a man of martial virtue, opened the coffin and found his countenance as if alive. They then re-clothed him in the Hall of Gold and Jade and reburied him.

In his youth, the Master studied Confucianism. In adulthood, he managed his household, amassing vast wealth yet delighting in aiding those in need. Thus, he earned renown for his generosity and disdain for riches—what the *Rites* calls *"accumulating yet able to disperse."* Though a scholar of great learning, he treated even a child with reverence—what Laozi meant by *"daring not to put oneself first in the world."* Following his master’s teachings, he propagated the Dao and guided disciples toward truth. Though dwelling in the mortal realm, he took the salvation of all as his duty—what the *Analects* calls *"a person who can broaden the Dao."* Upon encountering a perfected being, he received the mind-to-mind transmission, tempering himself daily without wavering in resolve—what Mencius meant by *"delighting in learning from others to do good."*

Thus, he evoked the auspicious vision of the mirage at the sea, transformed bitter springs into sacred nectar, and inspired Liu Qing to smash his butcher’s tools and reform, while Le Zhou burned his fishing nets to follow the wind. Wherever he passed, he transformed the land; arrogance and waywardness were corrected. Where his spirit dwelled, the old and young gathered in throngs. His virtuous deeds reached the western lands, and auspicious birds flocked from the eastern sea. At five sacred sites, he propagated the master’s teachings. Disciples such as Cao Xu, Lei Datong, Liu Zhenyi, and Yu Dongzhen—dozens of men—were all adepts who cultivated truth, attained the Dao, and upheld the lineage to revive the teachings, all molded by the Master’s guidance. Masters Tan Changzhen, Liu Changsheng, and Qiu Changchun, senior disciples of the Patriarch, honored the Master as their *"uncle-master"* and deferred to him with ease.

His lifetime of songs and poems were words transcending the mundane, yet they inspired many who came after. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *"True Man Danyang of Embracing Unity and Non-Action."* In the autumn of the nineteenth year, on the first day of the eighth month, Li Tianle, the True Man presiding over the Chongyang Wanshou Abbey on Mount Zhongnan, presented the Master’s recorded deeds to me, entreating, *"Our direct ancestral master, the Patriarch Danyang, is buried in Laiyang. The scholar Zhang Ziyi has already composed the *Record of Ascending Truth*. Yet the Patriarch’s great virtue in perfecting himself and others, his grand achievements, and the Master’s ability to inherit and propagate them—the Dao of riding the wind and governing qi, of longevity and eternal vision—all originate from this. The assembly at the ancestral court relies on these truths. To let his deeds fade without recording them for posterity would be a grievous omission. Will you not complete this text, that his legacy may endure?"*

I reflected: the source of the Dao and virtue, passed down through generations without confusion, owes much to Master Danyang. How could I refuse? Thus, I composed this inscription:

*The great Dao of heaven and earth follows nature,*
*When a perfected one emerges, it spans centuries.*
*The Dao is not broadened unless people propagate it,*
*Only when people broaden the Dao is it complete.*

*Chongyang drank deeply from the Sweet River’s spring,*
*His Dao-eye gazed straight at the eastern sea’s weak.*
*Golden flames blazed, unfolding seven lotuses,*
*With a sigh, he seized the horse and brandished his jade whip.*

*Danyang, a great scholar with karmic ties,*
*Cultivated merit until it became perfect and round.*
*Like ice melting, he returned to truth as an immortal,*
*His words flowed onto paper like clouds and mist.*

*His mechanism arose from the Kunlun peaks,*
*Subduing dragons and tigers with secret, wondrous arts.*
*Knowing and awakening without before or after,*
*At five sacred sites, he proclaimed the teachings.*

*Riding the wind, governing qi, roaming the eight limits,*
*He looked down on the mortal world as if it were an abyss.*
*His disciples and descendants, called great worthies,*
*Held ice and snow in their breasts, heaven in their flasks,*
*Transmitting the mind-to-mind teaching without end.*

**Inscription for the Immortal Stele of True Man Tan Changzhen**
*Composed by Jin Yuantao, Grand Master of Equal Rank with the Three Dukes, Pillar of State, Duke of Mi*

As the ancients said: *"The words of immortals are without rhetoric; the Dao is seen through mind-to-mind transmission."* The secrets of the elixir and the music of the flute flow into the vast and boundless void—how many have truly attained them? Hidden, they become rosy clouds and cinnabar landscapes; revealed, they become jade palaces and golden tablets. Such are the deeds of those who seem to act yet do not.

Those who reach the state of "non-action yet nothing left undone" may wander carefree, gourd in hand and sandals dragging, through taverns and inns, chanting and whistling, their cares forgotten, in perfect accord with wind and moon—such men approach the great recluses. *"Virtue is never solitary; it always has neighbors. The Dao does not forsake me to seek others."*

Huang, Qin, Chao, and Zhang—the Four Worthies of Dongpo’s circle—wielded poetry and prose of profound vigor and refined strength, thus amplifying their master’s teachings. Ma, Tan, Qiu, and Liu—the Four Immortals of Chongyang’s lineage—embodied the Dao in its emptiness and tranquility, their minds serene and still, thus illuminating the Way of their patriarch. How were the teachings amplified? How was the Dao illuminated? In truth, all sprang from a single mind.

Who, then, was the one who emptied his heart to clarify the Dao? The True Man Tan of Changzhen. His master’s tabooed name was Chuduan, his courtesy name Tongzheng, and he hailed from Ninghai Prefecture in Shandong. His father, a master of weaving and dyeing, conducted all matters of measure and exchange with perfect fairness, repaying his own livelihood to aid the poor and needy. Through accumulated goodness and layered virtue, he amassed abundant blessings—and thus was the master born.

From childhood, the master was radiant and precocious, his voice clear and resonant; all knew he was no ordinary child. At the age of six, while playing, he fell into a well. As rescuers rushed to descend, they saw him seated calmly upon the water, and lifting him out, found him entirely unharmed. Later, a fire broke out in his home, and a massive beam shattered before his bed. The master, deep in sleep, was roused, yet his composure remained undisturbed. Truly, one who embodies the Dao is not harmed by water or fire.

At fifteen, he turned his mind to learning, composing verses that stirred the soul. His *"Ode to the Grape"* soon became widely celebrated. Upon reaching adulthood, he was honored with the name "Jade," and he delved into the classics, mastering calligraphy in both cursive and clerical scripts. One day, drunk and overcome by snow, he collapsed upon the road, whereupon he contracted a paralyzing wind affliction. Sighing deeply, he reflected: *"Jade has striven in the world to little avail, and now suffers this strange malady—surely no medicine or stone can cure it."* He began reciting the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* in secret, seeking deliverance. Suddenly, he dreamed of a great mat suspended in the sky. As he ascended to claim it, he saw the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper seated in full regalia. He bowed in reverence, and upon waking, his devotion to the Dao deepened.

In the mid-autumn of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, hearing that the True Man Chongyang had initiated Ma Yifu as a disciple, the master hastened to the True Man’s abode. There, he pleaded to renounce the secular world, don the feathered robe, and take the disciple’s vow. The True Man assigned him a task and bade him stay in the hermitage. It was the depths of winter, snow swirling, the elixir furnace cold as ice. The master slept upon a bed of seaweed, the cold so bitter it could sever fingers. The True Man then extended his foot, commanding the master to embrace it. Soon, sweat streamed down his body, as if he were seated in a steaming cauldron. At dawn, the True Man gave him the leftover water from his washing to cleanse his face. After a month of this daily ritual, his long-standing ailment vanished entirely.

From that moment, the master served his teacher with wholehearted reverence. When his wife, Madam Yan, came to the hermitage to summon him home, he grew angry and cast her out. He prostrated himself before the True Man, seeking the daily practice of the Dao. The True Man imparted a four-character secret formula, bestowed upon him his present name and style, and gave him the Daoist appellation *Changzhenzi*. The master was then sent to Weiyang to reside with Ma, Qiu, and Liu. The True Man’s *"Lyrics of Pacing the Void"* contain the line *"Attaining the True, Tan Jade"*—how profound its meaning!

When the True Man arrived in Bian, he left instructions entrusting the four disciples with the stewardship of the teaching. After Chongyang’s ascension, the master and the three great adepts bore their teacher’s remains back to Guanzhong, interring them in the western corner of the ancestral hermitage at Liujiang Village, where they performed the full rites of a disciple honoring his master.

Once, when invited to preside over a *changzhen* fast, the master braved freezing cold to cross a stream. Though the water rose to the level of his knees, his feet felt no discomfort—all marveled at this. Later, he took refuge in Hehuo, where he acquired a new hermitage at the shrine of the County Magistrate of She. One day, the master locked the hermitage and departed, saying he was bound for Weizhou. That evening, the shrine’s attendant, a man named Wen, saw the hermitage aglow with radiant light. Peering through the window, he beheld the master seated close to the fire. Startled, Wen withdrew in silence. At dawn, he secretly dispatched a servant to the prefecture, pretending to seek medicine from the master. When the servant arrived in Weizhou, he found the master still abed within. The medicine was given, and the servant returned. Upon inspecting the hermitage, he saw that the fire had not yet burned out—an event akin to the tales of Ji Zixun, who appeared in multiple households across different eras.

The master’s deeds are too numerous to recount in full; here, we briefly note a few:

Enduring the humiliation of a broken tooth—this was *virtue*.
Dispensing medicine in a dream—this was *spirit*.
Discerning the visit of a high official—this was *clarity*.

The inscription of the tortoise and serpent to ward off fire—this was *spirit*.
To possess virtue that could commune with the divine, clarity that could aid the numinous—what else but an immortal could this be?

Moreover, it was heard that the master made no distinction between noble and base, worthy and unworthy, nor between mountain forests and city streets, yet all were transformed by his Dao, none failing to find peace. He composed over a hundred songs and poems, which he titled *The Water and Clouds Collection*. Having long admired the land of Tianzhong in Luoyang, where many cultivated the Dao, he intended to make it his place of alchemical perfection. Upon seeing Chaoyuan Palace in the south of Luoyang—the former residence of Langranzi—he cherished its luminous mountains and waters, where traces of the past still remained. A Daoist named Zhang Yongshou then presided over the temple’s affairs, and the master was granted several *mu* of vacant land to the east. There, he cleared the brambles, gathered the stones, and built a hermitage. A Luoyang devotee of the Dao, a certain Mr. Zhu, constructed another hermitage and invited the master to reside within. During his spiritual wanderings in Zhu’s hermitage, the master seemed to encounter Chongyang and Danyang, who revealed to him his immortal destiny. He soon returned to his former dwelling at Chaoyuan, which is now the Qixia Abbey. The abbey was later named by Master Qiu Changchun.

On the first day of the fourth lunar month in the year *yisi* of the Dading era, he composed a final ode without illness and passed away. An extraordinary fragrance lingered in the chamber for days, and he lived to the age of sixty-three. The tortoise and serpent he once depicted foretold his transcendence in the year, month, and hour of *si*—a prescient sign.

His disciples Wang Daoming and Dong Shangzhi had paid homage to the master since childhood, bearing the toil of fetching water and tending incense with unwavering devotion. Decades after the master’s ascension, they remained by his immortal tomb. Wang oversaw the affairs of Qixia Abbey, while Dong ensured that the rituals of offering and sacrifice were performed without fail. When plans were made to relocate the master’s remains, Li, the Director of Studies, along with the four great Daoist masters—Li Zhiyuan, Yu Shanqing, Wang Zhiyuan, and Chen Wuran—entrusted this old man with the composition of an inscription. With reverence and joy, I took up my brush to write:

The Perfected One of Chongyang,
Master of the Great Dao,
Master Changzhen followed him,
Adjusting his robes in devotion.
Heart transmitted to heart,
Even spirits and ghosts unaware.
I know this perfected one,
Born in a sacred age.
Others prized his marvels,
I revered his truth.
From the east he unfolded his teachings,
In the west of Luoyang he left his traces.
His words endure in song and verse,
His name inscribed in metal and stone.
Rising on rosy clouds, the mystic wind,
The alchemical elixir unfurls its petals.
A wild crane, proud and towering,
A sacred tortoise bearing its treasured text.
Subduing fire, mastering water,
Harmonizing yin, regulating yang.
Manifesting in dreams, his Dao’s protection grows ever clearer—
The master is not gone,
His fragrance lingers for a thousand ages.

**Stele Inscription on the Daoist Conduct of Perfected Master Liu of Longevity**
*Composed by Qin Zhi’an*

To embrace the Mother of Qi, to contain primordial essence, to fathom the boundless, to peer into the abyssal dark, to contract the earth’s veins, to draw forth the heavens’ shoulders, to traverse the infinitesimal vastness where dust and specks stretch without end—
to lash the scorching void, to strike the numinous hollow, to tread the boundless expanse, to shoulder the primal chaos—
all things depend upon it to take form, all transformations rely upon it to attain numinosity.
How could this be within the grasp of common scholars or shallow, petty men?

Now, the Perfected One of Longevity from Donglai,
scion of the Jin-right clan, radiant remnant of the fiery Han,
soared like clouds on mighty wings, towered like a mountain’s essence.
Lakes and seas could not contain his depth, stars and constellations could not match his brilliance.

His ancestors and father dwelt in Wuguan, cherishing hidden virtue, delighting in generosity, relieving the cold and hungry, aiding the orphaned and widowed.
They donated over eighty *qing* of fertile fields to the grand monastery of Longxing, establishing a root of perpetual merit.
During the *Taiping Xingguo* era of the former Song, the imperial court praised their filial piety and righteousness, honoring their gate with banners, exempting them from taxes, their glory illuminating neighboring commanderies.
Heaven does not betray the benevolent: from amidst rosy clouds and cinnabar landscapes, it selected the most luminous of immortal talents and bestowed auspicious signs upon Yecheng.

Born into this world, he served his widowed mother with utmost devotion, his filial piety renowned.
He vowed never to marry or seek office, despising ostentation and false glory, preserving purity as if in twilight, regarding worldly things as nothing that could shake the sincerity in his breast.
He bid farewell to his native mountains, desiring to seek extraordinary men, yet his compassionate mother gazed longingly and would not permit it.

In the spring of the *Jichou* year of the *Dading* era, upon a wall in his neighbor’s home—where no hand could reach—he brushed two odes in fresh ink, leaving no name.
Their closing lines read:
*"Wuguan, land of nurturing nature, true immortal ground—*
*Here must dwell one who never dies."*
The Master marveled at the vigorous brushwork, suspecting it the work of a divine being, yet could not fully trust his conviction.

That autumn, in the ninth month, when frost was crisp and dew clear, Master Chongyang of the Double Ninth staffed his staff and journeyed west, accompanied by the finest of the Three Immortals—Qiu, Tan, and Ma—crossing sea isles and traversing mountain towns.
Hearing this, the Master hastened forward in haste, bearing incense to welcome them.
Chongyang turned and smiled: *"Do you recognize the ink on that wall?"*
The Three Immortals exchanged glances and chuckled, then realized the odes were but divine transformations meant to astonish.

Thereupon, he carved his liver in offering, pledged his bones in oath, bearing the desk and staff, holding the towel and pitcher, obeying every command, dedicating his life and death to the Way.
Chongyang, moved by his earnestness and admiring his single-minded devotion, gazed upon his unmatched spirit and sighed:
*"The moon on the pine, the snow on the bamboo—*
*these are not for the yellow dust of the world."*
He bestowed a poem:
*"Returning from fishing, you see the turtle once more—*
*Know now your place among the ranks of immortals.*
*The call of the mallet summons my intent—*
*Leaping from the vast waves, ten thousand fathoms high!"*
Taking the meaning of the wall’s inscription, he named him *Changsheng* (Longevity), styled him *Chuxuan* (Abiding in the Mysterious), and gave him the courtesy name *Tongmiao* (Penetrating the Wondrous).
This occurred in the year following his twentieth.

The names of Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma resounded across the Nine Wilds and Eight Directions.
He traveled to Bianliang, lodged at Yimen, begged for alms to refine his form, concealed his name and identity.
Morning and night, he entreated, practicing purification through movement and stillness, humbly guiding the turning of the mysterious mechanism, earnestly illuminating the alchemical classics.
He swept away clouds of delusion, melted the ice of confusion.
Once Chongyang had transmitted to him the Four Symbols and Five Phases in their entirety, he departed the world of men and withdrew into heaven—
what is called *"finding a true friend and ascending Penglai."*

The Four Disciples bore the immortal’s remains, repaid their boundless debt, knocked at Xianyang, passed through Huayin, and settled their spirits in the old abode of Liu and Jiang.
Their aspirations diverged: the Master alone withdrew to Luojing, refining his nature amidst the dust and chaos, nurturing purity within the clamor of the marketplace.
Music could not disturb his harmony, flowers and willows could not sway his essence.
His heart turned colder than ashes, his form stiffer than wood, unyielding to spring’s touch.
When others labored, he ate; when they did not, he showed no resentment.
If questioned, he responded with gestures; if not, he sat in silent stillness all day.

His power of concentration perfected, celestial radiance shone forth.
He moved to the banks of Yunxi, where his disciples carved a grotto chamber into the cliffs.
Suddenly, they encountered a stone well, its cold spring gurgling.
The crowd marveled at its strangeness, but the Master smiled: *"A few feet farther lie two more wells—*
*these were the sites of my past-life cultivation."*
They dug and found them as he said. To this day, the grotto is called *Three Springs.*

In the *Bingshen* year, he returned to Wuguan to pay homage to his mother.
Their reunion was filled with awe.
He selected the northern slope of Mount Taiji to build the ancestral hall of Lingxu, planting cypress and pine, their verdant ranks now towering.
Soon after, villagers falsely accused him of murder.
Without protest, he submitted to arrest, enduring nearly a hundred days in confinement.
Perfected One Lü of Pure Yang, hearing the jade water-clock, rode a blue *lin* down from the azure heavens, entered the prison cell, and with a brush from Guanzhong, taught him to practice calligraphy.
Later, the true murderer confessed, and the Master was spared the fetters.

Upon his release, his brushwork had attained sublime mastery, its strokes like soaring dragons and serpents.
In the *Wushen* year of *Dading*, he presided over a ritual at Changyang.
Colored clouds veiled the altar, white cranes danced in the courtyard.
That autumn, drought scorched the land like fire.
He again offered prayers for rain with utmost sincerity.
Ascending the altar, he gazed in all directions—no clouds in sight.
Yet he declared: *"By midday tomorrow, sweet rain will pour as if upturned."*
His words proved prophetic, as if echo and shadow responding to form and sound.

Thereafter, he alone presided over the ritual altars of the eastern provinces, where auspicious winds would always arise, cool and crisp, lifting the paper money heavenward.
His responses were as if divine, and to this day, stone inscriptions in various commanderies still attest to this.

In the third year of *Chengan*, Emperor Zhangzong, having heard of his resounding reputation in the Dao, dispatched envoys to summon him. Presented with crane-engraved tablets and rush mats, he was received in the *Zichen* Palace and treated as an honored guest. A jade-like abode was bestowed upon him, named *Xiuzhen*. Officials, scholars, and commoners thronged ceaselessly, so that the sandals outside his door were never empty.

The following year, in the third month, he petitioned to return to his native mountains. The Son of Heaven dared not treat him as a subject, instead bestowing upon him the title *Lingxu* and honoring his ancestral sanctuary. In the second month of the *Guihai* year, on the auspicious sixth day of mid-spring, he assembled his disciples with drumbeats to announce his departure for the *Wenyuan* gardens. Curling his left arm beneath his head, he serenely returned to the True. Auspicious light suffused the air, and propitious qi swirled in abundance. His posthumous writings—celestial music echoing in the void—spoke of harmonizing with the dust of the world, of tranquil cultivation of the Dao, of expounding the *Daodejing*, elucidating the *Yinfu*, and explicating the *Huangting*. His teachings penetrated the mysteries of the sagely and the true, serving as a model for ten thousand generations.

Master *Piyun Song* inherited the lineage, his brush bearing the Dharma-wheel. He drank the marrow of the moon and consumed the essence of the sun, awakened the Mysterious Female, and harmonized the Valley Spirit. Mindful of the grace of a thousand kalpas, he recorded the soaring feats of his master, inscribing them upon the verdant slopes of Mount Cang. The inscription reads:

*The Elder Immortal of Longevity, wielding the power of transformation,*
*Swallows the void, exhales the natural.*
*Riding purple clouds, he descends;*
*Roaming the edge of the azure sea,*
*He encounters the celestial convergence of *Jiazi*,*
*And meets the *Chongyang* master after countless kalpas.*
*He strikes the hundred passes, unseals the nine springs,*
*Drives the four beasts, tills the three fields.*
*Seated in the markets of Luoyang,*
*He carves a grotto-heaven in Yunxi.*
*Melting white snow into powder,*
*Ripening dark frost without smoke,*
*His fame resounds like drums in Fengzhou,*
*His radiance illumines the golden lotus.*
*He constructs the *Lingxu* sanctuary,*
*Receives the purple edict of the court.*
*Returning, he severs the old debts of Donglai,*
*Then flesh and bone dissolve as he roams the eight heavens in revelry.*

**Stele Inscription on the Meritorious Deeds of the Perfected Lord of Eternal Spring**
Composed by Layman *Jitong* Chen Shike

In the autumn of the *Wuzi* year, the eighth month on the day of *Bingwu*, I arrived in the capital from Shandong and lodged at the *Changchun* Palace for sixty days. As I prepared to relocate, Master *Qinghe* Yin said to me: "Our late master, the Perfected One, has already been interred. A stele should be erected. You knew him best—would you compose the inscription to be carved for posterity?" I demurred before the elders, pleading that my late arrival and exhausted thoughts were inadequate to illuminate the Elder Immortal. He would not relent. Thus, he commanded his Dharma-brother, the Great Master *Xuantong* Li Haoran, to recount the Perfected One’s deeds and present them to me for inscription.

The master’s father was the Perfected Lord of Eternal Spring, surnamed Qiu, personal name *Chuji*, style *Tongmi*, a native of Qixia in Dengzhou. From childhood, he was keenly intelligent, memorizing over a thousand words daily and retaining them unfailingly. Before reaching adulthood, he sought the Dao. He encountered the Patriarchal Master *Chongyang* in the misty grotto of Kunlun Mountain. The Patriarch, recognizing him as no ordinary man, bestowed upon him the *Golden Scale* ode and accepted him as a disciple. Soon after, Masters *Longevity* Liu, *Perfected* Tan, and *Danyang* Ma all gathered at his seat, their bond one of mutual accord. The world called them the "Four Masters: Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma."

In the ninth year of *Dading*, he accompanied the Patriarch on a journey to Liang. The following year, the Patriarch departed this world. In the twelfth year, the master and Master *Danyang* escorted the Patriarch’s remains back to Zhongnan, where they were interred in his hometown. The master then retreated to a cave in Fanxi, begging for a single meal each day and wearing only a straw raincoat, even eschewing a bamboo hat or gourd. People called him the "Straw-Cloak Master." For six years, he never slept. Later, he secluded himself in Longmen Mountain of Longzhou for seven years, living as he had in Fanxi. Such was his devotion to the Dao.

Once his cultivation was complete, disciples from afar flocked to him. *Jiagu* Gong, the military commissioner of Jingzhao, submitted a memorial requesting his return to the Patriarch’s former retreat. Upon his arrival, he constructed an ancestral hall of splendid beauty, with all else in equal measure. The various regions called it the *Zu’an*, and the mystic wind flourished anew. In the spring of the twenty-eighth year, the court, having heard of his virtue and power, summoned him to the capital. An abode was built for him west of the *Wanning* Palace to facilitate consultation. In the fifth month of summer, he was received at *Changsong* Isle; in the seventh month of autumn, he was summoned again. He expounded the profoundest principles, ascending the first winding terrace of the *Yaotai*. His favor was most generous. The following day, an imperial envoy presented peaches from the *Shanglin* gardens. The master had not tasted tea or fruit for over a decade, yet he accepted one and ate it, honoring the emperor’s gift. In the eighth month, he received an edict permitting his return to Zhongnan, along with a gift of one hundred thousand coins, which he declined. Thereafter, he resided once more at the *Zu’an*.

In the second year of *Mingchang*, he returned east to Qixia and built a grand jade-like palace, petitioning for its plaque, which was bestowed as *Taixu*. Its grandeur made it the crown of Daoist groves in the east. During the *Taihe* era, the empress dowager, deeply devoted to the Dao, revered the master from afar within the palace and sent him a complete collection of Daoist scriptures. After settling by the sea, the number of high officials and nobles who honored and supported him grew daily. *Liu Shiru*, the military commissioner of Dinghai, and *Zou Yingzhong*, two elders and renowned ministers of the age, both befriended him.

In the autumn of the *Jiaxu* year of *Zhenyou*, Shandong was in turmoil. *Pusan* Gong, the emperor’s son-in-law and commander of the punitive forces, requested the master’s aid in pacifying and instructing the region. Wherever he went, soldiers laid down their arms and submitted to his commands, and the two prefectures of Deng and Ninghai were thus pacified. In the winter of the *Jimao* year, Emperor Chengjisihan dispatched his minister *Liu Zhonglu* with an invitation. The following spring, the master set forth. In the fourth month of summer, passing through Juyong, he encountered a band of robbers to the north at night. They bowed their heads in retreat, saying, "Do not alarm the father-master." In the tenth month of that year, the master submitted a memorial at Wuchuan. The returned envoy carried an edict urging his westward journey, addressing him as "Master" and "Perfected One," so highly was he esteemed. The following spring, he crossed the Yumen Pass and headed north. In the fourth month of the *Renwu* year, he finally reached India and met the emperor on the southern slopes of the Great Snow Mountains.

When asked about the elixir of immortality, the master merely cited the classics on preserving life in response. Another day, as they discoursed repeatedly on benevolence and filial piety, the emperor, recognizing their sincerity, commended him.

In the third month of the *Guiwei* year, the imperial carriage arrived at Sairam. The emperor issued an edict permitting the master to return east and bestowed upon him the rites of a state funeral. The master firmly declined, saying, "On my journey home of ten thousand *li*, provisions for four-horse carriages and lodging will suffice." The emperor approved his petition and, in consequence, exempted all his disciples from taxes and corvée labor.

As the master traveled by post-horse back and forth, wherever he passed, welcomers numbered in the thousands. The sandals outside his lodgings piled high, and upon his departure, some even clung to his horse’s bridle, weeping. Such was the depth of his influence on people’s hearts.

Upon entering the Central Plains, Daoist followers from all directions journeyed a thousand *li* or more to meet him, and every city he passed through sought to detain him. In the eighth month, he arrived in Xuande, where the marshal invited him to reside at Chaoyuan Abbey in Zhenzhou.

The following spring, at the request of the Branch Secretariat, he took up residence at the Great Tianchang Abbey in Yanjing. Thereafter, whenever envoys were sent to the imperial palace, the emperor would invariably inquire after the "Divine Immortal," and upon their return, messages of imperial favor would follow. Once, he declared, "All the lands under my rule—let him dwell wherever he wishes."

Later, the Branch Secretariat offered Jade Flower Island as a site for an abbey. Though the ravages of war had left Tianchang in ruins, the island was in even worse condition. The master restored it, and without soliciting funds, materials poured in from near and far, renewing the site every three years.

During his time at Tianchang, scholars and seekers gathered like clouds, inquiring into the profound mysteries of the Dao. Schools and sects of every kind turned toward his influence. Whenever he performed rituals, cranes would appear. When Mars trespassed against the Tail constellation, he performed rites to avert it, and the planet retreated. When droughts oppressed the people, his prayers brought rain. The people of the capital revered him, establishing the Eight Assemblies of Changchun and spreading his teachings in all directions.

In the fifth month of the *Dinghai* year, an edict renamed Jade Flower Island as Wanan Palace and Tianchang Abbey as Changchun Palace, granting envoys golden tiger tallies to protect the Daoist gate. On the twenty-third day of the sixth month, a great thunderstorm erupted. The southern bank of Taiye Pond collapsed, and water surged into the Eastern Lake, its roar audible for *li*. Fish and turtles fled, and the northern mountain’s mouth also crumbled. Some said this was an omen, but the master merely smiled and said, "When mountains crumble and ponds dry, I shall depart with them."

On the fourth day of the seventh month, he turned to his disciples and said, "Long ago, Lord Danyang foretold: 'After my passing, the Daoist gate will flourish greatly, and the four directions will transform into Daoist villages. You will be present for this, and you shall preside over grand abbeys.' Every word has come to pass. I depart without regret."

Soon after, he fell ill and repeatedly rose from his sickbed. His attendants urged him to rest, but he replied, "I do not wish to burden others. You still cling to distinctions—what difference is there between lying down and sitting?" On the seventh day, the supervisor Song Dao’an and others begged him to ascend the hall to meet the assembly’s expectations. The master said, "On the ninth day, I shall go to the hall."

On that day, he left a final ode, *Preserving the Light*, and departed this world at the age of eighty. The following year, on the day before the seventh evening of the seventh month, as his disciples prepared for the burial, they opened the coffin to find the master serene, as if still alive. Daoists and laypeople came to pay their respects for three days, numbering ten thousand each day, all marveling in awe.

After the ninth-day ritual concluded, his immortal remains were enshrined in the Hall of Compliance at White Cloud Abbey. The master was sincere, wise, compassionate, and frugal. Whenever generals and commanders came to pay their respects, he invariably advised them against killing. Those in distress he aided without fail, and if any scholar was captured, he secured their release. Wherever his disciples and followers went, they invoked his name, sparing many from the ravages of war.

He guided his disciples according to their abilities: the most gifted he led to the Dao, the next he instructed in meritorious conduct, and the rest he taught through the principles of karma. None were neglected. Thus, in life, disciples from all directions painted his portrait and revered him. In death, those near mourned deeply, while those far away hastened to pay their respects, as if for their own parents. At his funeral, ten thousand gathered.

Among the eminent Daoists of recent times, none have matched the master in both virtue and blessings. He read all the Daoist scriptures, and Confucian texts and Buddhist sutras were also at his fingertips. He delighted in composing essays and poems, though he never sought refinement. His focus was always on expounding the profound essentials of the Dao. Though he did not engage in ornate craftsmanship, his words naturally formed literature. His works, *Fanxi* and *Mingdao*, circulate in the world.

Alas! Master Haoran was able to record his father-master’s deeds so clearly—truly a filial son, whose account needs no embellishment from a humble scholar like myself. Nevertheless, let us discuss his greatness.

This old immortal lived without desire and passed without decay—a rare figure across the ages. With the humble status of a yellow-crowned Daoist, he moved emperors above and deeply touched the hearts of the people below. Could any but one of utmost sincerity and pure virtue achieve this?

When the tall pines were first seen, his Dao was already lofty. Upon his return from India, the Daoist gate flourished even more. Among the ancients, his path roughly resembled that of Master Kou. Yet when comparing their conduct, profound differences emerge.

Why? When Master Kou gained the favor of the Wei ruler, he claimed to have met Laozi, who taught him the arts of grain avoidance and bodily lightness, along with precepts to purify and rectify Daoism. He also encountered Laozi’s great-great-grandson, who bestowed upon him the *True Scripture of the Heavenly Palace* and the method of *Jinglu*, instructing him to assist the Northern True Lord of Great Peace. With the support of Cui Hao, the emperor began to revere him.

The old immortal was not like this. Before his summons, he dwelled tranquilly by the sea, long forgotten by the world. One day, an edict arrived to welcome him—this arose naturally, not through any contrivance. And in his memorials and responses, he spoke only of the Dao.

Thus considered, his virtue far surpasses that of Kou Qianzhi—this alone would suffice for inscription. How much more so for his possession of the Dao-eye and the perfection of his Dao-practice? Rightly then did a worthy successor appear, one like Master Yin emerging in turn to illuminate the wondrous Dao and ensure its transmission without lapse.

Respectfully appended is the inscription, which reads:

The Quanzhen lineage,
Has the Dao as its source.
Who is its primal ancestor?
The sagely Mysterious Origin.

Who first guided it?
Chongyang at its inception.
Who magnified it?
His disciple, Changchun.

The Master dwelt by Fan Stream,
Six years in a single straw cloak.
No bamboo basket nor gourd bowl had he,
Yet all called him worthy.

His hermitage at Dragon Gate
Was likewise thus—
Feather-robed disciples came to him,
As thirsty men to water.

Truly a perfected immortal,
A celestial grove of the Dao,
Abiding in stillness within,
His qi encompassed the great thousand.

Shizong sought his counsel,
Twice visiting Pine Isle.
Soon after, he heard of his return to the mountains,
Where mist and vine embraced his old age.

In the reign of Zhangzong,
A palace was built by the sea.
The emperor and empress bequeathed scriptures,
Renewing the treasury of sacred texts.

When war arose,
A single torch turned all to scorched earth.
The Master led his followers,
Wandering among cloud-girt isles.

The dragon arose in the northern court,
Summoning him like a star of office.
Only upon his return eastward
Did the Dao flourish ever more.

In his lifetime,
The world painted his likeness.
Suddenly he vanished—
Yet a grand hall and deep burial honored him.

A son proved worthy to succeed,
Master Yin was the man,
Perfect in fortune and virtue,
Great indeed was Changchun.

**Eulogy**
Composed by Ding’an Wu Zhang

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the dinghai year, Sun Zhou and other officials of the Yanjing Academy of Classical Learning reverently offer incense, tea, and libations to the spirit of the Perfected Master Changchun, the Immortal Qiu Xi.

Alas, O Transcendent Elder,
In youth you left the household life,
In maturity you attained the Dao.
Nine times eight immortals,
Five times four recluses—
No book unread,
No affair unknown.
Keeper of the Nine Classics,
Tortoise of the Five Summits—
The world’s venerable elder,
The Son of Heaven’s teacher.
Your name inscribed in the immortal ranks,
Yet you dwelt among the dust of the world.
With a lift of your arm, you roamed boundlessly,
Riding a crane to the Three Mountains.
Your fame filled the age,
Enduring through a thousand autumns and ten thousand generations.
What was abiding?
What was departing?
Your dharma-heirs,
Your jade-green companions of the Way,
Gathered in mourning, scriptures filling the hall,
Grieving as for the loss of father and mother.

We, your humble followers,
Have long been favored with your deepest wisdom.
Now, offering libations before your spirit-seat,
Our vessels tremble with sorrow.

Alas! Alas!
The ruler’s longevity and the state’s peace—
You brought them to pass.
The senses and faculties of all beings—
You awakened them.
Drought and flood as treasures—
You averted them.
You ascended as a flying immortal—
How could we ever forget you?

Alas, on this day of mourning,
May you partake of these offerings.

**Stele Inscription with Preface for the Perfected Person Wang, Master of the Dao in Embracing the Mysterious and Vast Transformation, Yu Yang**

*Composed by Yao Sui, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Participant in the Drafting of Imperial Edicts, and Co-Compiler of the National History*

In the twenty-fourth year of the Zhiyuan era, the dinghai year, in the ninth month of autumn, Li Daoqian, Perfected Person of Celestial Music and Supervisor of Daoist Teachings in the Nine Circuits of Qin and Shu, arrived together with He Zhichong, Supervisor of the Shangqing Taiping Palace on Mount Zhongnan, and Li Zhizhen. They declared: Upon reverently reading the imperial edict of the sixth year, we find that Zhang Zhijing, Perfected Person of Illuminating Virtue and Rectitude, who oversees the teachings, was commanded by the provincial authorities to act accordingly.

The Emperor proclaimed: From the time Donghua transmitted the teachings to the era when Chongyang initiated transformation, We have felt that posthumous honors were insufficient. Thus, We have ordered scholar-officials to bestow exalted titles. The Patriarchs shall be enfeoffed as follows: Donghua, the Purple Palace Lesser Yang Sovereign Lord; Zhongli, Perfected Person of Correct Yang, Awakened Transmitter of the Dao; Lü, Perfected Person of Pure Yang, Expounder of Orthodox Transformation; Liu, Perfected Person of Sea Toad, Enlightened Promulgator of the Dao; Wang, Perfected Person of Chongyang, Perfect Realizer of the Dao’s Transformation; Ma, Perfected Person of Danyang, Embracer of Unity and Non-Action; Tan, Perfected Person of Changzhen, Cloud-Water Cultivator of Accumulated Virtue; Liu, Perfected Person of Longevity, Assistant in Transformation and Illuminator of Virtue; Qiu, Perfected Person of Ever-Spring, Expounder of the Dao and Master of Teachings; Wang, Perfected Person of Yu Yang, Embracer of the Mysterious and Vast Transformer; Hao, Perfected Person of Broad Tranquility, Ancient Perfected of Penetrating the Mysterious; and Sun, Perfected Person of Pure Serenity, Profound and Upright Cultivator of Virtue.

In their cultivation of virtue and transmission of the Dao, their sagely decrees emerged as if from Heaven itself—measured in sentiment, fitting in degree, moistening the dead and benefiting the living. The legacy of the Dao thus shines forth, enduring for ten thousand generations.

Among the seven disciples of the Perfected Person of Chongyang, one was a woman, while the remaining six Perfected Ones pursued the Dao with unwavering resolve, their attainment fraught with difficulty. Yet, fearing that their deeds might fade from human memory, and that without inscription in metal or stone, their legacy would not reach distant posterity, they have entreated this humble servant.

Since assuming my post in the Historiography Institute, I have often reflected on the ancients: historians did not await the dead’s awareness nor the living’s requests. Whether in virtue, merit, deeds, or words, what was seen was recorded as seen, what was heard as heard—truth was transmitted as truth, doubt as doubt. The unvarnished record was presented directly, allowing readers of later ages to judge right and wrong for themselves. Even those skilled in divination, commerce, minor arts, jest, reclusion, or extraordinary conduct were deemed worthy of transmission—how much more so these Perfected Ones, whom the sagely emperor has decreed to honor and exalt! Surely they merit commemoration. It is not for us Confucians to decline on the grounds that we do not practice their Way, nor to refuse on account of duty.

Examining the records of events and accounts of wondrous deeds, the Perfected One bore the surname Wang, given name Chuyi, and hailed from Ninghai’s Shumou. On the eighteenth day of the third month in the renxu year of Jin Xizong’s Huangtong reign, his mother dreamed of a crimson mist enveloping her body before giving birth. At seven, he died without illness and revived, thereafter seeming to grasp the discourse on life and death.

Later, he encountered a strange man who sat upon a great stone and approached, stroking his head and speaking to him. He also heard a voice from the void, a spirit self-styled as the Master of the Dark Court Palace. Upon returning home, he cast off his robes and went barefoot, singing wildly in the marketplace. Some thought him mad, others recognized his freedom from affliction. They sought to clothe him in cap and gown and marry him off, but he refused. Thus, both he and his mother embraced the teachings of the Old Master.

In the eighth year of Shizong’s Dading reign, at twenty-seven, he heard that the Perfected Lord of Enlightenment had arrived in his prefecture and wished to join the ranks of disciples. The Perfected Lord, discerning his aptitude for the Dao, bestowed upon him his present name. He then resided in the Misty Grotto of Kun’s Arrow Mountain, and his mother was given the name Deqing, styled the Untrammeled Recluse of Dark Purity.

The following year, he took leave to dwell on Cha Mountain. The Perfected Lord, accompanied by his disciples—the Four Perfected Ones: Ma Wuwei, Tan Yunde, Qiu Yandao, and Hao Taigu—departed from Wendeng on their way back to Ninghai, passing through Longquan, two hundred li from Cha Mountain. It was a scorching summer day when the Perfected Lord, holding an umbrella, flew forth from his own hand. Before noon, it fell upon Cha Mountain, its handle bearing the three characters *Jieyangzi*, marking his master’s trace. The character *jie* does not appear in any lexicon; it seems the Perfected Lord coined it to style the Perfected One. Later, a poem emerged linking *jie* and bamboo to form the character *qi* (seven), as if *jie* were the root, with five strokes of bamboo and two of man combining to make seven.

Later, he dwelt in Cloudlight Grotto, his resolve and conduct stern and austere. He once leaned over a great ravine, standing on one foot at the edge. Onlookers’ eyes bulged, their hair stood on end, and their tongues stiffened, unable to retract—hence he was called the Iron-Footed Immortal. After nine years in the grotto, he refined his form and spirit. His poem in praise of Everlasting Spring reads:

*For nine summers, he stood facing the sun,*
*For three winters, he slept embracing the snow.*

Was he not akin to those who walk through fire unscorched and enter water undrenched?

Roaming the lands of Qi and Lu, he displayed his arts to the fullest, delivering men, expelling ghosts, treading upon thieves, shattering stones, projecting his spirit into dreams, summoning rain, shaking peaks, boiling chickens to summon cranes, reviving the dead, and breathing life into the withered. With a wave of his hand or a sharp rebuke, he commanded a thousand li in all directions. White-haired elders and yellow-haired children flocked to his doorstep in droves. Some accused him of deceiving the people with sorcery. Once, he was summoned to drink poisoned wine. Before departing, he instructed his disciples to dig a pond, fill it with water, and stir it into turbidity. Upon arrival, he took the cup and drained it, saying, “I am a poor man, unaccustomed to begging from others. Today, I am fortunate to be invited; I beg the remainder of your cup to allay your fears.” They gave it to him, and he drank it all. Returning, he stripped and bathed in the pond. After a while, the water boiled away, and though he survived, his hair and beard were singed, leaving him unable to don a cap.

In the twenty-seventh year, he was summoned to the capital at Yanjing and resided in the Temple of Celestial Longevity. The emperor inquired about preserving health and governing. He replied, “Nurture the spirit by retaining essence, and govern through reverent inaction. Even if Guangchengzi were to return and speak to Your Majesty, he could not surpass your servant.” Shizong praised him. Later, when asked about drinking poison, he said, “I have never made enemies, but this arose from an illness.” Some claimed he was a strange man, while others slandered him as a sorcerer. Shizong tested him with poison, but seeing he could not be killed, he repented in anger and banished the slanderers. At the time, this was concealed, and the story was falsely spread.

The following year, the Temple of Cultivating Perfection was built, but he did not reside there long. Seeking to return to the mountains, Shizong reluctantly allowed him to depart. That year, Shizong fell ill, and he was summoned again. The Perfected One told the messenger, “This journey would not be difficult, but I truly fear I shall not live to gaze upon his radiant countenance again.” The next year, on the third day of the first month, he arrived, but Shizong had already passed the day before. Zhangzong retained him to perform rites for the deceased emperor’s soul. That year, he returned to the mountains.

A wealthy man of Laiyang, Liu Zhi, had no sons. In the sixth month, he invited the Perfected One and served him meager wine. The Perfected One said, “Go fetch the wine from your storeroom.” Liu searched as instructed and found his wife had secretly hidden it, unbeknownst to others. After drinking, the Perfected One left behind a four-by-four grid of characters, saying, “Let this be your heir.” The following year, on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, the Perfected Lord descended at dawn. Liu indeed fathered a son, and his household rejoiced, saying, “The four-by-four grid—did the Perfected One point to the date as an omen?” They sought to name the child, and the Perfected One said, “I have already named him *Yingzhen* (Responding Perfected).”

In the second year of Cheng’an, he was summoned again to the imperial palace. When asked about preserving health, he replied as he had to Shizong. He was bestowed the purple robe and titled Great Master of Embodied Mystery, residing in the Temple of Lofty Fortune, with a monthly stipend of two hundred strings of cash. At that time, Lü Dao’an sought to rebuild the ancestral hall—the former abode of the Perfected Lord—but lacking imperial favor, dared not gather followers. The Perfected One memorialized the throne to establish the Temple of Numinous Emptiness, granting Lü the title Great Master of Soaring Emptiness, and the construction of the ancestral hall began in earnest.

As his mother, the Untrammeled Recluse of Dark Purity, reached ninety, he sought to return to the mountains to attend her. The emperor graciously permitted his departure. In the first and third years of the Taihe reign, edicts were issued to hold grand rites for all under heaven at the Supreme Clarity Palace in Bozhou, ordaining over a thousand commoners as Daoist priests. That year, the Untrammeled Recluse passed away.

In the seventh year, he resided at the Jade Void Temple of Sacred Water, where the imperial consort presented a complete canon of Daoist scriptures. In the first year of Da’an, he was invited to reside at the Temple of Flourishing Yang in the northern capital. In the gengwu year, he performed rites in Yutian County of Jizhou. To his disciples, he said, “Do you hear the clashing of swords and the clamor in the void? The qi of the northern realm is about to turn; many lives will suffer its ravages.” That year, the imperial armies indeed marched south.

In the bingzi year, he was invited to reside at the Temple of Celestial Treasure in Wendeng. The following year, on the twenty-third day of the fourth month, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, bowed to the four directions, and passed away at the age of seventy-six. His *Collection of Thunder’s Purchase of Light* circulates in the world. Those who expound upon his teachings branch into numerous schools, exceeding the Six Sects, numbering no fewer than ten thousand.

The disciple of Qiu the Daoist, Perfected One Yin Qinghe, was a great patriarch of the Dao, regarding the Perfected One as his uncle. In the yiwei year, he selected his grandson, Qinglingzi Liu Zhiyuan, to establish the Supreme Clarity Temple of Great Peace. This was because the commoner Zhang Shouzhen of Zhengzuo could recite the words of the Perfected Lord of Sagely Protection and Virtue with precision, foretelling both present and future fortunes and misfortunes. He was also entrusted with the Nine Altars and Three Swords method to capture and expel demonic entities. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of Song, officials were encouraged to construct a thousand-pillared temple to enshrine the numinous spirits. When the Jin dynasty fell into chaos, the temple was burned to ashes, leaving only charred wood and broken tiles. Qingling cleared the brambles and cut the thatch to make his dwelling. As the sun dipped toward the western mountains, he barely completed the Hall of Blessed Protection before passing away.

His disciples—Chen Zhixuan, Zhu Zhiyan, Zhao Zhigu, Zhang Zhiyin, Li Zhizong, Li Zhiming, Cui Zhi’an, Zhao Zhizhen, and the two present masters, He and Li—ten in all, succeeded one another in the lineage. Over forty-five years, they constructed the Halls of Illuminating Brightness, Purple Tenuity, and Seven Primes; the Altar of the August Sovereign; the Gate of Soaring Empyrean; the four halls dedicated to the Divine Marshal, the Dharma-Expounding Master, the Serene Master, and the Responsive Dharma Master; as well as bell towers, refectories, and nearly two hundred bays of auxiliary structures. Though their layout was inferior to the ancestral temple, it still stood as the foremost mountain sanctuary and blessed site in the lands west of the Pass, unrivaled in its grandeur.

Alas! The Supreme Clarity Temple was built during the Taiping Xingguo era of the Song, funded by the imperial treasury and exhausting the wealth of the western lands. After its destruction, it was revived through the efforts of but a few Daoist followers. The Perfected One was born and passed away during the Jin dynasty, yet was posthumously honored by the imperial Yuan. Though his life and death occurred in the eastern mountains, his disciples spread his teachings in the west, selecting propitious sites to enshrine their patriarch—a matter of principle not easily fathomed.

Had the Perfected One truly been immortal, soaring through the void and riding the qi, would he not have clapped his hands in the clouds and exclaimed, “My grandson and his descendants have indeed shown such talent!”

A poem reads:
*In youth, pure and weighty,*
*Four lords all of Yang—*
*Though not born in the same age,*
*Their names inherit fragrance.*

*Is it not because those of Yang*
*Are by nature close to heaven?*
*Lightly ascending the void,*
*They easily turn toward the Way.*

*Why then is there but one lord,*
*Self-styled “Sea Toad,”*
*Who grasps the moon’s essence*
*And follows the sun to receive its light?*

*The sun and moon are the changes,*
*The key to nurturing life.*
*As the world declines, of five lords,*
*Who shall unravel their mysteries?*

I have often pondered:
*In youth, pure as the toad,*
*Across generations, distant and vast,*
*The esoteric learning has no heirs.*

Alas! Chongyang had but seven disciples,
*Yet among them was a woman—*
*Only six remained.*
*Father strong, son virtuous,*
*Amidst them, Yuyang:*
*Embodying the profound and vast,*
*He first feigned madness.*

*Singing in the marketplace,*
*He sought the Dao but saw it not.*
*Studying with Kun and Jian,*
*His understanding transformed.*

*Secluding himself on Chashan,*
*Then moving to Yun’guang,*
*In winter, he slept embracing snow;*
*In summer, he stood facing the sun.*

*After nine years, his virtue perfected,*
*Ghosts and bandits fled.*
*His spirit soared into dreams,*
*And myriad wonders emerged.*

*No poison was as deadly as the zhen-bird,*
*Yet he drank it as if it were broth.*
*His name resounded in Yandu,*
*And the imperial summons came from afar.*

*For nurturing life, he was sought for governance,*
*The imperial court inquired for his benefit.*
*His profound words dispelled doubts,*
*And in the deep of night, the emperor leaned forward in his seat.*

*He departed to establish the Cultivation of Perfection,*
*Yet returned to the mountains, steadfast in his pursuit.*
*With phoenix wings bearing the banner,*
*He could not be detained.*

*Upon his return, after some time,*
*Emperor Shizong fell ill.*
*Memorials to the court piled high,*
*And his petitions reached the emperor’s hands.*

*Refusing none who sought him,*
*He honored Blessed Jade Clarity.*
*At Huayang and Tianbao,*
*He did not regret his abode.*

*Wherever he taught,*
*His lineage emerged from a single source.*
*From disciples to grandsons,*
*His singular brilliance outshone ten thousand.*

*The waves of the Eastern Sea,*
*Spanning a hundred leagues, overflowed.*
*Now flowing westward,*
*They inundate the capital of Hao.*

*The Temple of Great Peace,*
*Ancient abode of immortals and sages—*
*One grandson, ten great-grandsons,*
*Cleared the brambles to rebuild it.*

*Though born in the east, he did not journey west,*
*And passed before a century had elapsed.*
*Yet his teachings spread westward,*
*Surpassing all other schools.*

*Let his stele record his life,*
*His Dao and deeds ever clearer.*
*O ancestors, O thoughts,*
*May future generations never lack instruction.*

**Stele Inscription for the Daoist Deeds of Perfected One Hao of Broad Tranquility and Primordial Mystery**
*Composed by Xu Ying of Dongping, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Chief Pacification Commissioner and Surveillance Commissioner of the Lingbei and Hunan Circuits*

Since the Yuan dynasty came to rule all under heaven, it has revered the worthy and delighted in goodness, surpassing all previous ages. For those of virtuous conduct who were not yet employed, it bestowed honors and distinctions to celebrate them, making no distinction between Daoist and secular, living and deceased.

In the second year of the Zhongtong era, an edict was issued conferring upon Wang Zhijin, the Recluse of Qiyun on Mount Pan, the title *Perfected One of Benevolent Compassion, Benefiting All Beings, and Utmost Virtue*. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era, an edict was issued posthumously conferring upon Hao Datong, master of Qiyun, the title *Perfected One of Broad Tranquility, Penetrating Mystery, and Primordial Antiquity*. In the twenty-third year of the Zhiyuan era, an edict was issued conferring upon Xu Zhigen, disciple of Qiyun, the title *Perfected One of Honoring Mystery, Sincere Virtue, and Illuminating Yang*, in recognition of his virtue.

That year, in the third month, as I was about to assume office in Hunan, I passed through Bianliang. At that time, Illuminating Yang oversaw the teachings of the school and resided at the Temple of the Celestial Court. He led his followers to meet me and petitioned, saying: “This poor Daoist has no extraordinary conduct in leaving the household life. Yet, by mistake, I have been noted by the sagely court and granted a laudable title, allowing me to be ranked among the Perfected Ones of my teachers. This is all due to the teachings of my late master, Qiyun.

Is not the reason Qiyun became renowned in the world solely due to the blessings of my former master, Primordial Antiquity? The Daoist deeds of both masters stand out remarkably and are known to all. Who does not recognize this? Yet, to ensure their legacy is faithfully transmitted to later generations and perpetually displayed, it is fitting that a scholar compose a record. For Qiyun, there is already the work of the Hanlin Academician, the Retired Scholar Wang, which has been engraved in stone. As for the stele of Primordial Antiquity, it is only right that it not be delayed, yet it remains absent. This is the fault of us, his unworthy successors in the lineage. I humbly request that you take up your brush for this task.”

Should you deign to bestow your favor upon us, the fault of our inadequacy would be absolved.

I, a timid scholar unversed in the profound learning, fear that in serving this task and framing these words, I may err and incur the ridicule of the discerning. Though I declined repeatedly, I could not in the end refuse. Moreover, Dongyang and I share the same lineage, and he has long treated me with great kindness, making it difficult to persist in refusal. Thus, I have relied upon the records of our patriarch’s deeds as compiled by Dongyang, gathering and weaving them together to present to you, appending a eulogistic poem and inscription so that those who chant the *Steps of the Void* may sing of the master’s virtue.

The master’s surname was Hao, his given name Datong, his courtesy name Taigu, and his Daoist appellation Guangningzi. He was a native of Ninghai. His family was once wealthy, the foremost household in the prefecture. His elder brother Junyan passed the imperial examinations and rose to the rank of Grand Master for Court Audiences, serving as magistrate of Changyi County.

In his youth, the master bore the name Sheng. Orphaned early, he served his mother with filial devotion. Endowed with exceptional intelligence and a disposition both serene and expansive, he possessed the innate qualities of one destined to transcend the mundane. Fond of reading, he took particular delight in the *Book of Changes*, delving into its mysteries with great depth. Through this, he mastered the arts of yin-yang, pitch pipes, and calendrical calculations. Yet he took no pleasure in official advancement, admiring instead the examples of Sima Jizhu and Yan Junping, concealing himself through divination.

In the seventh year of the Dading era, the Perfected Lord Wang, the True Master Chongyang, journeyed from Guanzhong to Ninghai and passed through the marketplace. Observing the master’s uncommon bearing and recognizing his immortal potential, he sought a means to awaken him. Turning his back to the shop, he said: “Why do you not turn back?” The master was startled and found his words extraordinary. When the Perfected Lord departed, the master closed his shop and followed him. Upon reaching his lodging, he sought instruction.

The Perfected Lord bestowed upon him two verses, and the master experienced a great awakening, unconsciously bowing in reverence. From that day forth, he visited daily to receive direct instruction. Yet, as his aged mother still lived, he did not immediately enter the Dao. The following year, when his mother passed away, the master abandoned his home and journeyed to Mount Kunjian, where he paid homage to the Perfected Lord at the Misty Cloud Grotto and sought to become his disciple. The Perfected Lord accepted him, bestowing the name *Lin* and the sobriquet *Tranquil One*, then removed his own robe, tore off its sleeves, and gave it to him, saying: “Do not lament the lack of sleeves—you shall forge your own path.” This conveyed the intent of transmitting the Dharma.

In the ninth year, the people of Ninghai constructed the Golden Lotus Hall to await the Perfected Lord’s return, who would lead his disciples west to reside there. The master, carrying an earthen jar, begged for alms when he accidentally shattered it. The Perfected Lord presented him with another jar, inscribing a verse upon it:

*Shattered the true ash jar,*
*Yet gained the Wind-Harmonizing Abbey.*
*Only when the remnants are realized,*
*Will someone call you by name.*

Shortly after, the master took leave of the Perfected Lord and departed with Wang Yuyang to dwell on Mount Cha. The Perfected Lord then journeyed to Bianjing, accompanied by Ma Danyang, Tan Changzhen, Liu Changsheng, and Qiu Changchun. In the eleventh year, learning that the Perfected Lord had ascended to immortality and the Four Disciples had entered Guanzhong, the master traveled west in search of them. In the twelfth year, he interred the Perfected Lord at the ancestral sanctuary and wished to join the Four Disciples in guarding the tomb. Changzhen admonished him, saying: “Can you merely follow in others’ footsteps?” The next day, the master departed and, upon reaching Mount Qi, encountered a divine being who bestowed upon him his present name and Daoist title.

In the twelfth year, he crossed the Great Celebration Pass and journeyed east, soaring through the lands of Zhao and Wei. In the fifteenth year, he sat beneath the Stone Bridge of Wozhou, sealing his lips in silence. Though the river swelled and overflowed, he did not stir, and the waters did not reach him. If people offered food, he ate; if not, he remained unmoved. Through bitter cold and scorching heat, he sat motionless, his body like withered wood and his heart like dead ashes—thus for six years. The youngest daughter of the Lord of Changyi, married to Guo Changqian of Zhen Ding, passed through Wozhou with her husband. Learning of the master beneath the bridge, they halted their carriage to pay homage and presented him with clothing and provisions, offering abundant comfort. The master, however, regarded them with indifference, as if they were strangers, and accepted nothing. The lady wept in sorrow, and Guo Changqian sighed in wonder as they departed.

In the twenty-second year, the master passed through Luancheng and again encountered a divine being, from whom he received the secret meanings of the *Great Changes*. Thereafter, his predictions of future events were never off by even a hair’s breadth. Upon arriving at Zhenyang, he ascended the hall of a Daoist abbey to expound the Dao, drawing hundreds of listeners from near and far. Thereafter, he propagated the teachings across the land, dedicating himself to benefiting beings and guiding others. Thus, the name of Hao Taigu resounded throughout the realm.

At the beginning of the Mingchang era, he returned east to Ninghai. One day, wishing to create a diagram of the *Changes*, he abruptly demanded brush and paper. As his porridge was just ready, his disciples hesitated, suggesting he eat first. The master replied: “Bring them at once! I am in the midst of inspiration—how can I wait for porridge?” Taking up the brush, he spread the paper and brushed the diagrams with the speed of wind and rain. By mid-morning, he had completed thirty-three charts, their meanings encompassing the profound mysteries of heaven and humanity, uncharted by former sages. Wang Xianzuo of Xianping, a scholar skilled in divination, upon seeing the master’s work, revered him deeply, abandoning his own studies to learn from him. Through this, his arts advanced, and his fame reached the imperial court. Other wondrous deeds—such as foretelling the fire at Tianchang Peak to Hou Zizhen or appearing in the dreams of Wang Zhenguo of Enzhou—were too numerous to record.

At the age of seventy-three, on the last day of the twelfth lunar month in the first year of the Chongqing era, he shed his mortal form at the Primordial Abbey of Ninghai. Three years prior, he had urged his disciples to prepare his tomb, foretelling the date of his death, which came to pass as predicted. His lifetime works included *On the Three Teachings Entering the Changes* (1 juan), *Direct Words on Instruction* (1 juan), *Commentary on the Heart Sutra* (1 juan), *Commentary on the Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* (1 juan), *Essential Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, as well as poems, rhapsodies, miscellaneous writings, and ballads, along with the *Changes* diagrams he had created. These were compiled into *The Taigu Collection* (15 juan), which circulated in the world.

Alas! The Daoist tradition traces its origins to Laozi and Zhuangzi. Yet later generations lost its original intent, branching into techniques, talismans, alchemy, and ritual invocations. The more the schools divided, the further they strayed—this has been the case for ages. By the late Jin dynasty, the Perfected Lord Chongyang, without relying on teachers or friends, attained a sudden awakening beyond ordinary men, as if by heavenly decree. Rising in Zhongnan and reaching Kunjian, he gathered like-minded souls, instructing and refining them, and founded a school called Quanzhen. Its practice broadly emphasized recognizing the mind and seeing one’s nature, eliminating passions and desires, enduring shame and embracing disgrace, and suffering for oneself while benefiting others as its core principles. This aligned with Laozi’s words: “Know the masculine, keep to the feminine; know the white, keep to the black; know the honorable, keep to the humble,” and “Reduce and further reduce, until you reach non-action.” It also echoed Zhuangzi’s: “Let the mind wander in simplicity, merge with the vastness; be pure and constant, like one who is mad; transcend heaven and earth, forget all things; probe the root and rest in the ultimate—where power is complete yet virtue does not manifest.” Quanzhen embodied these teachings, reuniting the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi.

Chongyang initiated it, and the Six Disciples—Ma, Tan, Liu, Qiu, Wang, and Hao—harmonized with him. The Daoist lineages of the world traced their origins to them, known as the Seven Perfected. Who but those divinely endowed could partake in this? After the master’s passing, his disciples spread far and wide, and many carried on his legacy. Among his foremost disciples, Fan Xuantong and Wang Zongshi of Cloud Abode were the most eminent. During the turmoil of the Central Plains and the early years of the imperial Longxing era, one resided in Dongping, while the other traveled between Yan and Bian, establishing abbeys, opening altars, gathering disciples, and expounding the teachings. Revered by high and low alike, the school’s influence flourished, and its prestige soared—all thanks to Taigu.

In the present day, the elders of Dongyang remain steadfast in their exhortations—unyielding, resolute, and plainspoken—nourished by their master’s virtue, rectifying what their forebears had left undone. Amid the tumult of Daoist and Buddhist strife, when all was in disarray and resistance seemed futile, they remained serene and composed, upholding humility, embracing submission, and abiding in tranquility. Their cultivation knew no fixed method, yet their progress never ceased. Thus, they attained sagely wisdom from above and were honored with imperial decrees of praise. In comparing the ease or difficulty of their path, they did not fall short of Xiyun. If not for the legacy of Taigu, to whom else could such merit be ascribed?

Those who now seek to know Taigu should observe his disciples; those who seek to know his disciples should observe their successors.

**Inscription:**
The eastern clouds and seas stretch empty, again empty,
Immortals emerge and vanish in the radiant void.
I have long marveled at Dongpo’s words—
For if immortals exist, the Eight Directions share the same truth.

Yet why should excellence be confined to the eastern bell?
Kun and Jian mountains rise, rivaling heaven’s height.
Gazing left and right, they embrace Fusang’s palace,
Where a single grotto lies sealed in mist and rosy clouds.

Hongyang summoned them, commanding ghostly craftsmen,
Purple and black threads weaving through the floating world.
Ma, Tan, Liu, Qiu, Wang, and Hao followed—
Six stalwart heroes, each a dragon among men.

From Penglai’s peaks they came, ethereal and remote,
Startled to see the azure sea polished like bronze.
Behold! Seven golden lotuses, resplendent—
Truly, immortals arise from the East.

Among them, Master Hao, phoenix and dragon,
Purified his heart to attain emptiness and clarity.
His actions hidden, his retreat marked by modesty,
He cast off wealth and rank like chaff, unburdening his breast.

His firmness deterred all who might test his edge.
Trained anew, he encountered General Wang,
And in a single transmission of patched robes, their spirits merged.
Whether clad in sleeves or not, let each sew as they please.

Among his fellow disciples, Gui and Zhong,
Need not follow others’ paths.
Like Zhang Guo’s traces at Wolzhou’s stone bridge,
Or the morning rainbow’s molt piercing the azure vault.

The Great Dao resides at this northern and southern crossroads—
Why seek distant pines in clouded peaks?
To halt is not laziness,
For *gen* marks the beginning and end of all things.

Seated in lotus, he mended deafness and blindness,
At dawn, gazing at the sun’s rising light, his eyes brightened.
Swallowing mist, his belly glowed with cinnabar fire;
At dusk, he observed the flowing waves, facing their source.

The river chariot drew water, the frost-laden fleabane turned,
When questioned, he bowed low.
As if striking a great bell with a tiny mallet,
He waved them away, lest they disrupt his work.

Passersby on the bridge bore the dust of the world,
Chasing fame and profit, losing themselves.
To him, the world’s people were but ants and bees—
His form was earth and wood, his heart as vast as the wild goose’s flight.

Those who cling to trivial gains, ashamed of their dullness,
Should turn inward to awaken.
Curb greed, temper desire, and cast off sorrow—
Through ceaseless toil, seasons turn from autumn to winter.

A hundred feelings, even a fraction, are enough.
Such benefits—who could exhaust them?
Steadfast for six years, truly arduous cultivation,
Nurtured the wondrous maiden and linked infants.

Sleeves raised in dance, knowing virtue’s fullness,
He wished to extend his surplus to the suffering.
To universally deliver all, transcending cages,
Like clay on the potter’s wheel or gold in the crucible.

Grubs and snails, no fixed form—
Once the work was complete, he departed in an instant.
Soaring on flying rosy clouds, jade pendants chiming,
His cloud-borne chariot and misty steed weighed heavy on the azure waves.

Weak waters stretch ten thousand miles, dim and boundless,
Huainan’s Xiao Mountain, its osmanthus groves now empty.
To plant the yellow sprout requires a gardener’s care—
Yet the master cannot be seen, my heart heavy with longing.

Even the old immortal of Xiyun is hard to meet,
But the world is sustained by Xu Shenxi.

**Eulogy to the Seven Perfected**
Composed by Wang Cuizi of Beiping

**The Seven Perfected**

**Wang Zhenren of Chongyang**
Emerging in response to the Dao’s turning, peerless in heroism.
At Gan River, his encounter left him dazed, like a madman.
He gathered the Four Masters, grandly inaugurating the Complete Perfection.
Majestic the teachings—spanning the Eastern Sea and Western Qin.

**Ma Zhenren of Danyang**
Late to awaken to his extraordinary cause, he relinquished all family wealth.
After a thousand mornings of cultivation, he received the Three Topknots from his master.
Wind and thunder heralded his transformation; gold and jade left his final words.
Distant his former footsteps—how could they be retraced?

**Tan Zhenren of Changzhen**
At first sight of the Perfected One, his chronic ailments vanished.
Fiercely he entered the Dao, with water and clouds as his companions.
Returning to settle in Zhongnan, he gathered disciples in Luo’s land.
Once the teaching’s wind had spread, he shed his form and ascended.

**Liu Zhenren of Changsheng**
The power of his youthful purity, upheld by sages and worthies.
His bearing refined and extraordinary, his labors in the Luo markets.
Though beset by hardship, his resolve never wavered.
His renown ultimately shone, and he was summoned to the sea’s edge.

**Qiu Zhenren of Changchun**
Ah, that elder—never to be found again.
Thrice honored by the court, for his talent, learning, and virtue.
Moved by the ravages of war, he journeyed far to the northwest.
At eighty-one, he passed—none could fathom his depth.

**Wang Zhenren of Yuyang**
In youth, he met the Mystic Court, twice paying homage to Chongyang.
A flying canopy bore his title; golden lotuses shared his fragrance.
His traces brimmed with divine marvels, his name stirred emperors.
A lofty mountain’s radiant path—his glory shines through the ages.

**Hao Zhenren of Guangning**
Though born of noble lineage, he alone cherished forests and springs.
Two poems, one robe—his devotion to the master never ceased.
Divine signs revealed the *Yi*’s secrets; six years at Wo Bridge.
Transforming adversity and fortune, all aligned with nature.

**Epitaph and Preface for the Perfected Master Yin, the True Person of Vast Transformation through the Wondrous Dao of Clarity and Harmony**

Composed by Yi Ke of Ruyang

The Master was the sixth-generation patriarch of the Quanzhen lineage, inheriting the teachings of *Shouzhen*. Under his guidance, the transformative influence of the Dao flourished, surpassing the past tenfold. Yet the realm of form and vessel shares the same end in all ages. At eighty-three, he suddenly sighed at the prospect of casting off his robe and raising his hands in departure. On the sixth day of the second lunar month in the *xinhai* year, he ascended at the *Qinghe Palace* on Mount Dafang.

For nearly a decade, he had settled his spirit upon the Five-Flowered Mountain. One day, the enlightened *Zhang Gong*, who succeeded him in the teaching, addressed the assembly: "The Master of Clarity and Harmony sought to repay the debt of gratitude to his forebears. Thus, he performed the grand funeral rites and, at that blessed site, erected palaces and halls—unmatched in splendor beneath heaven—thereby magnifying the ancestral Dao. His merit surpasses all past and present. We who enjoy the fruits of his labor have yet to offer even the slightest repayment; our shame runs deep. We shall now inscribe a stele to record his deeds for endless generations. What say you?" The assembly unanimously assented.

In the third year of *Zhongtong*, on an auspicious day in the tenth lunar month, they commissioned *Yi Ke* of Ruyang to compose the text. I, though unworthy, dared not refuse, for the Master’s virtue and power were profound, his mysteries boundless—how could my crude and shallow words ever capture or depict them? Thus, I humbly followed the *Xingzhuang* recorded by his disciple *Ma Zhitong*, gathering the visible and witnessed manifestations of his merit and virtue to compose this account.

The Dao in the world is but one. Yet the endowments bestowed by Heaven upon the sagely and worthy are never lacking, though their manifestations in aiding this world—whether in duration, scope, or immediacy—vary. Why? The answer lies in the times. The times are not something even the sagely can command; they can only avoid being shackled by them. Some bow in the halls of state, others humbly instruct from secluded corners. Some transform through stillness, governing with deference; others pacify floods, sow seeds, or quell chaos to rescue the drowning. When culture overwhelms substance, they teach a return to purity and simplicity. When rites crumble and music collapses, they restore the teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants. Whether their influence spans the world and ages or is confined to a single commandery or village, they adapt to circumstances and shift with the times. Yet their aim remains the same: to follow the Dao and aid the world.

Viewed through their deeds, the disparities in their achievements arise from the differing eras they encountered. Yet the Dao bestowed by Heaven upon the sagely and worthy has never been twofold. The Dao is like water: when thirsty, it becomes a drink; in drought, it becomes irrigation. The Dao is like fire: when hungry, it cooks food; in cold, it warms the body. Though its uses differ, water and fire remain unchanged. Is the Dao any different?

In recent times, the Mandate of the Golden Register expired, and chaos erupted. The black-haired people were slaughtered like livestock, jade and stone alike burned in the flames. Heaven, in its compassion, raised forth a perfected one, entrusting him with the Dao to extend a hand of deliverance. After *Chongyang*, *Danyang*, *Changzhen*, *Changsheng*, and *Changchun* emerged in succession, and the Quanzhen teaching flourished. When *Qinghe* inherited the mantle from *Changchun*, the transmission between them held no hidden mysteries of the successive sages. Like a father’s work continued by his son, he propagated the teaching for decades. His disciples spread across the land, his reputation resounding in court and countryside alike. Where his influence reached, the fierce softened their hearts, the stubborn submitted, and the oppressive gave way to stillness. He turned raging fires into peaceful mats, lifting a generation of the coarse and short-lived into the realm of benevolence and longevity. In the grandeur of teachings and the magnitude of merit, none surpassed the Master of Clarity and Harmony. For the Dao bestowed by Heaven is one, yet the times he encountered were unique.

The Master’s personal name was *Zhiping*, his courtesy name *Dahe*, and his surname *Yin*. His distant ancestors hailed from Cangzhou. During the former Song, one held office in Laizhou and settled there. His illustrious great-great-grandmother bore nine sons, all of whom passed the imperial examinations and served as prefects—seven of them. His illustrious great-grandfather *Gongzhi* and his illustrious father *Hongyi* both concealed their virtue, never seeking renown.

The Master was born on the twenty-first day of the first lunar month in the ninth year of *Dading*. That night, his mother dreamed of an extraordinary procession, all in splendid attire, entering her chamber. Startled, she awoke to find the Master already born. The villagers rushed to their home, shouting, "The Yin residence is on fire!" But upon arrival, no flames were found.

As he grew, his bearing surpassed that of ordinary children. At three, he was precocious and quick to remember; at five, he entered school, reciting over a thousand words daily, grasping the profound meaning of his readings. Once, while observing ancestral rites, he pondered the principles of life and death, lost in distant contemplation. At seven, he encountered Master *Wang* of Shaanxi and felt drawn to follow him. At fourteen, he met the Perfected *Danyang* and immediately wished to abandon his home for the Dao, but his father resisted. He fled in secret. At nineteen, his family forced him to return, confining him, yet he escaped repeatedly until they finally relented.

He resided at the Western Hermitage in Changyi County, often sitting alone beneath a tree until dawn. One evening, he saw the Perfected *Changsheng Liu* arrive like a drifting cloud. The Perfected severed his head, split open his heart, and replaced them. Awakening, he gained profound insight.

Later, he dwelled at a hermitage in Fushan County, tending to the sick and aiding the distressed for years, earning the reverence of all. Traveling to Weizhou, the dragon-and-tiger clan of the *Wanyan* family, once proud and aloof, admired his virtue. They donated garden land to build the *Yuqing* Abbey, where the entire household honored him. Though the abbey was later destroyed in war, its pines and cypresses flourished into a dense forest.

Later, he paid homage to the Perfected *Changchun* at the *Qixia* Abbey, bowing as a disciple. The Perfected held him in special regard, transmitting all without reservation. He also received the *Yi* from the Perfected *Hao* of *Taigu* and oral instructions from the Perfected *Yuyang Wang*. From then on, his Daoist practice advanced daily, his reputation soaring. Scholars from all directions flocked to him as their master.

In the *jimao* year, the *Taizu Emperor* dispatched *Liu Zhonglu*, acting on imperial authority, to summon the Perfected *Changchun*...

When *Liu Zhonglu* arrived in *Yidu*, the Perfected *Changchang* Li said: "Master *Changchun* is now at sea. Without first meeting Master *Yin*, this grand affair cannot be accomplished." Upon reaching *Weiyang*, he paid his respects to the Master in the private chamber of *Yuqing* Abbey. Struck by the Master’s solemn and dignified bearing, *Zhonglu* unconsciously felt awe and reverence. When the imperial decree was calmly presented, the Master rejoiced greatly, saying: "To awaken the people with this Dao—now is the time!" Thereupon, they journeyed together to pay homage to the Perfected *Changchun* at the *Haotian* Abbey in *Laizhou*.

Previously, both the Jin and Song courts had repeatedly sent envoys with summons, all of which he declined. This time, at the Master’s urging, he agreed to set out, planning his route northward. His retinue numbered eighteen, all men of long-standing virtue and renown, with the Master at their head. From the *xinsi* year to the *guiwei* year, they endured countless hardships and obstacles. Upon meeting the Emperor in Western India, his memorials and responses met with imperial approval. On their return to *Yunzhong*, the Perfected learned of unrest in the eastern mountains and the southward advance of the imperial army. He declared: "The lives of the people there hang by a thread. None but you can save them." Thus, he was dispatched to offer pacification and comfort. Those who heard him rejoiced and submitted, and many lives were spared.

In the *yiyou* year, he persuaded the Perfected *Changchun* to reside at the *Taiji* Palace, which is today’s *Changchun* Palace. Though the Master remained in his subordinate’s seat, scholars from all directions gathered like clouds to honor him. The Master said: "I have no merit or virtue—how dare I accept such offerings?" He then withdrew to the *Longyang* Abbey in *Dexing*. The Perfected *Changchun* repeatedly expressed his trust in him through personal letters. When the Perfected ascended, the Master had already retreated to the *Yanxia* Abbey, intending to vanish into seclusion. But the community, pleading for him to assume leadership, reluctantly persuaded him to return to *Changchun* Palace. Taking up the succession, his followers multiplied like spokes converging at a hub, and those bearing tribute and offerings filled the halls daily.

One day, he told his disciples: "I have long been burdened by worldly affairs and yearn for the mountains and forests." Thus, when invited to preside over the rites at *Pingle*, he slipped away to *Jingzhou* and then to the eastern mountains. Before long, the officials and scholars of *Yanjing* urgently entreated him to return to the palace. In the *renchen* year, as the Emperor returned from his southern campaign, the Master greeted him at *Shuntian*. The Emperor received him with great warmth and had the Empress personally offer incense at *Changchun* Palace, bestowing generous rewards.

In the spring of the *jiawu* year, he traveled to *Mujian* Mountain. *Li Xuxuan* of the *Taixuan* Abbey remarked to others: "Last year, a mist of blue *qi* lingered over our abbey for days. The diviners said an extraordinary person would arrive—and now the Master has come, proving their words true." In the late spring, as he journeyed south, he reached *Yutian*, where the people rejoiced and urged him to stay for several days. As dusk fell, he suddenly hastened his carriage, traveling over fifty *li* through the night before resting in a field of tall grass. His followers did not understand why. Only later, upon returning to the palace, did they learn that at *Yutian*, hundreds of bandits had planned to raid them. The bandits pursued them to *Dahedian* but turned back, unable to catch up. His disciples congratulated one another, saying: "Without the Master, what would have become of us?" At that time, the Empress sent envoys to express her concern, bestowing a complete collection of Daoist scriptures.

In the spring of the *yiwei* year, he traveled to *Qinzhou* to preside over the *Huanglu* rites. As he entered *Jiaocheng*, some locals dreamed that the local earth deity said: "The Perfected One is coming—guard and protect him from harm." When he conducted the rites in *Pingyao*, the land had suffered prolonged drought and wind. Yet for three days and nights, the lamps and candles burned undisturbed, while elsewhere the winds still raged. *Du Dekang*, the commander of *Qinzhou*, and *Liang Yu*, the commander of *Pingyao*, each donated land for abbeys, and the entire region devoted itself to him.

In the ninth month, he arrived in *Pingyang* and ordered *Song* of *Piyun* to lead the carving of the *Daoist Canon* printing blocks. Within a few years, the project was completed at great expense, yet the people willingly contributed, for the Master had laid the foundation. Seeing the Dao’s teachings flourish, he attributed the success to the founding master, the Perfected *Chongyang*, and turned his attention to the ancestral abbey.

At that time, *Tian*, the provincial governor of *Jingzhao*, sent an urgent memorial to invite him. Coincidentally, this aligned with the Master’s own wishes. In the spring of the *bingshen* year, he arrived. Amid the overgrown wilderness, he surveyed and marked the burial grounds and the foundations for abbeys. The abbeys of *Zhongnan*, *Taihua*, and other sites, long abandoned and beyond restoration, all requested him to take charge. As *Shanxi* had only recently been pacified, some survivors still held out in fortified strongholds. Upon hearing of the Master’s arrival, they surrendered one after another. He comforted and reassured them, and all returned to their homes in peace.

Later, he was summoned to *Yunzhong* and tasked with selecting the most disciplined and virtuous Daoists from across the land to pray for the nation’s blessings and guide the people toward goodness. At that time, the *Xingguo* Abbey in *Pingbi*, *Shenqing* of *Dun*, the *Yuxu Baiyun* Grotto of *Qian’gao*, the *Chongyang* Abbey in *Dingxiang*, the *Shenxiao* Abbey in *Ji*, and the *Xuandu* Abbey in *Pingyang* were all placed under his care.

In the autumn, the Emperor ordered *Yang*, the Minister of the Secretariat, to summon him back to *Yanjing*. Passing through the *Taihang* Mountains, bandits knelt in submission and received his teachings, all becoming law-abiding citizens. As he traveled through *Jingxing*, then *Zhao*, *Wei*, *Qi*, and *Lu*, those seeking his guidance were politely turned away. Yet along the roads and in the fields, people set out incense and flowers, bowing in welcome as he passed. The number of those who came to pay their respects daily reached into the tens of thousands, and the gifts piled up like mountains, though he paid them no heed.

In the spring of the *wuxu* year, he suddenly declared: "I am old and weary of worldly affairs." On the first day of the first month, he passed his robe and alms bowl to the Perfected *Changchang* Li, entrusting him with the leadership of the teachings. He then chose to build a retreat on *Wuhua* Mountain and renovated the *Zhenyang* Abbey on *Dafang* Mountain, renaming it *Qinghe* Palace, intending it as his place of retirement.

The burial preparations at the ancestral abbey on *Zhongnan* were already complete. In the winter of the *gengzi* year, he was invited to oversee the project. He went gladly, undeterred by the bitter cold or treacherous paths, saying: "This is but a small repayment of my debt to my master." That winter, *Jingzhao* suffered from drought. The people prayed, saying: "The Master’s arrival will bring harmony—snow will fall as soon as he arrives." And indeed, as he disembarked, snow began to fall. The grand burial rites were held on the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the following year.

Though *Shanxi* had only recently been pacified and remained a critical border region, those who gathered for the funeral—Daoists and laypeople from all directions—numbered in the tens of thousands. Rumors swirled, and unrest loomed. Yet owing to the Master’s long-standing virtue and moral authority, he quelled all disturbances, ensuring the rites were completed without incident.

At the outset, True Man Chongyang had cultivated the Dao here, and upon its completion, he burned his thatched hut and departed, leaving behind a poem with the intent that later generations would restore it. Now, the Master fulfilled this wish, echoing the words of those who would follow the ancestral path to continue the work. Ah! The beginning and end of a century’s affairs intertwined so perfectly—how could this be mere coincidence? Thereupon, he cleared the overgrowth and leveled the mounds, and construction began in earnest: halls, porches, pavilions, and towers all rose anew. Once completed, he named it *Chongyang*, to signify his repayment of the foundational debt. Other temples—such as *Yuntai* on Mount Hua, *Huaqing* on Mount Li, and *Zongsheng* in Taiping—were each entrusted to venerable elders of great renown, their restoration and renewal surpassing their former glory.

That year, as he returned to Yan, he passed through Taiyuan in the fifth month of summer. Since spring, no rain had fallen, and the fields lay unsown. Moved by compassion, the Master took from his own treasury to fund incense and offerings, praying on behalf of the people. A great rain then poured down. Soon after his return to Yan, he said to his attendants: "I have long favored the western hall of *Qinghe Palace* as my dwelling. Prepare it for me now." They complied. The following day, he departed this life. After the rites for the *Washing of the Buddha* were completed, he took leave of the assembly, saying: "I am about to pass away." The crowd was stunned. The Master said: "My resolve is firm—what more is there to say?" When someone offered paper and brush, he remained silent. He only instructed that his burial should not be lavish. Then he ceased eating, drinking only water and tea, sitting upright as he discoursed on the Dao, his voice resonant and unnaturally strong.

That night, he adjusted his robes and cap, folded his arm beneath his head, and passed away. The mourners wailed in grief beyond measure. A fragrant aroma filled the chamber, and those who heard of it from afar hastened to offer condolences and gifts, their sorrow as profound as if they had lost their own parents. Initially, the Master had wished to be buried at *Dafang*, but his officials and disciples pleaded otherwise, and so he was interred at *Wuhua*, yielding to their wishes. In the second year of the *Zhongtong* reign, an imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title *True Man of Pure Harmony, Wondrous Dao, and Vast Transformation*.

The Master’s writings were prolific. His disciples compiled them into a collection titled *Baoguang Ji*, along with his *Recorded Sayings*, both of which thoroughly expounded the classics and revealed the essence of the Dao—embodying the ideal of broad learning distilled into concise discourse. At the time, imperial decrees lauded his virtues, and eminent officials and scholars composed poems and essays in his praise, later gathered into a volume titled *Yinglü Lu*. In guiding his followers, he made no distinctions of high or low, illuminating the path with clarity. He taught that humility, diligence, and restraint were the keys to cultivating the mind, and that practice and action were the foundation of entering the Dao. Yet when he expounded freely, he occasionally revealed the subtleties of the Dao’s hidden mechanisms—what is called "exhausting principle, fulfilling one’s nature, and attaining destiny."

Those who entered his gate progressed from the outer halls to the inner sanctum; even those who did not advance far remained sincere and steadfast. Such was his transformative influence on others. For twenty years, he resided in the *Longhu* household of Weiyang, where concubines and attendants filled his presence daily, yet none ever saw his face. Once, he lost a fine horse, and when the thief was caught, the evidence was irrefutable. Fearing punishment, the thief denied it, insisting, "This is my horse." The Master simply returned the horse and let him go. Such was his loftiness, untouched by worldly entanglements.

His qi, vast and unyielding, filled his being and manifested outwardly. To behold him was to see a divine presence; to approach him was to feel the warmth of spring. Though he never raged, his authority was palpable; though he held no rank, his dignity was innate. Neither the might of an emperor could add to his weight, nor the lowliest station diminish it. Such was the cultivation of his daily life.

When the times aligned and he found favor with the ruler, he wielded the Dao’s power to aid all beings. Like timely winds and seasonable rains, his blessings extended far and wide, ensuring that all creatures—whether crawling or breathing—found their rightful place. Such were the manifestations of his efficacy.

His utmost sincerity and foresight moved the divine, often surpassing human expectations. Endowed by heaven with extraordinary gifts and building upon a foundation of accumulated merit, he was like the sun at its zenith or the moon at its fullness—naturally radiant without striving. Yet he remained humble, content in simplicity, his transformations responding to boundless conditions, his spirit abiding in the vastness of emptiness. His essence and function were perfectly balanced, free from excess or deficiency. Was he not one of those who, though sharing the same source, flowed in different streams?

Some may argue that the Master neglected the cardinal principles of human relations. This is far from the truth. Since the realm had fallen into chaos and the rites of Hua had collapsed, the corruption of customs ran deep—how could it be limited to mere displays of virtue, empty words, or the spectacle of *Eight Rows of Dancers* in the palace, or the imperial hunt? Yet where his transformative influence passed, the violent became benevolent, the greedy became yielding, the arrogant became restrained. Order was restored between high and low. In upholding the cardinal principles, his merit was beyond measure.

I lament those who, blind to the greater whole, recklessly divide and fragment. Thus, I have addressed this as well.

**Inscription:**
In an age of decline, the axis of earth turned awry,
The royal net unraveled, and wars raged on.
The people, like minnows in a cauldron,
Were ground between the jaws of a thousand hungry beasts.

Heaven, in its compassion, sent a perfected one,
Whose divine teachings set boundaries and took charge.
The lineage of Chongyang has its origins,
Tracing back to the primordial, before heaven and earth.

Was there truly a *Ganhe* spring in the world?
After ten thousand kalpas, its flow remains unceasing.
It flowed into Weiyang, before the *Jade Clarity* temple,
Nourishing six generations to bloom like golden lotuses.

Though the chaos was pierced, the great Dao remained whole,
The accumulated haze swept away, leaving the solitary moon full.
The supreme principle is all-embracing, neither biased nor partial—
Not even the masters of *Qi Yuan* or *Zheng Pu* could claim exclusivity.

Meeting the times and gaining the ruler’s favor, he wielded subtle power,
His discernment not swayed by mere beauty or charm.
Like a soaring wild swan at the edge of the Peng Sea,
He traversed the gates of heaven, covering ten thousand miles in flight.

Who would believe that turtles could be hooked or tigers tamed,
That myriad creatures would submit to his staff?
He dredged the nine rivers, turning desolation into abundance,
Transforming the scorched earth into fields of jade.

Like the *Jingwei* bird filling the sea with stones,
Or the *Mingling* larva swiftly transformed by prayer,
The winds and clouds of a thousand years were no accident—
Turning misfortune to blessing, all through hidden connections.

Returning, he expounded the teachings and discoursed on the wondrous mystery,
His words savored like the *Nine-Nine* classic.
Scrolls of jade-like texts filled ten thousand volumes,
Proving at last that heaven holds no foolish immortals.

At the Wei and Si Rivers, were there merely three thousand disciples?
The lamps, great and small, all shone with radiant clarity.

With a heart, one dared not claim madness as sanctity;
With a mouth, one could scarcely speak of the unimpeded Chan.
Some said his merit and conduct were narrow as the Eight Delusions,
Yet his waves and illusions followed the humble and unassuming.

His thatched hut was but a single beam, a rustic retreat,
Where he ate the *lingzhi* and *taifang* mushrooms, his belly full.
With a straight hook he sat fishing atop the three peaks,
Where the sacred land’s flowers and trees flourished lush and green.

Green mountains did not hinder the drifting clouds,
And though dead, he was not lost—his longevity ever extended.
On other mountains lay jade-like ore, truly fit for forging,
Its light shining through a hundred million kalpas, ageless and timeless.

A thousand streams and ten thousand valleys divided the beauty,
Yet the bright moon still hung in the blue heavens above.

*The Stele Inscription for the Daoist Virtues of the Grand Master and True Perpetual Realized One, Who Presides Over the Mysterious Gate’s Teachings*

Composed by Wang Que, Hanlin Academician, *Chengyi* Grand Master, Participant in the Drafting of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History

The Daoist school is called Quanzhen, with True Man Chongyang as its patriarch. From his immortal encounter at Gan River, the burning of his hut by Liu and Jiang, to his proselytizing in Guandong, barely a decade passed before the world unanimously revered him. Had he not been steadfast in the Dao and clear in self-knowledge, how could he have established such a resplendent legacy?

In the end, he sought out the extraordinary and visited the reclusive, gathering four eminent disciples: Danyang, Changzhen, Changsheng, and Changchun. These four were all capable of rectifying the mysterious principles and propagating the sagely teachings, renewing the Dao and virtue as the times demanded. How far-reaching was their influence!

As for extending invitations to two nations and making his name resound across the four directions, living without desire and perishing without decay—only Master Changchun achieved this. He saved beings with benevolence, delivered people with compassion, and in his serene boundlessness, all virtues followed him. Thus, those who entered his gate were invariably men of keen intelligence and exceptional talent. Yet his transmission of the Dharma and succession of the teachings ended solely with two masters: Yin Qinghe and Li Zhenchang.

Master Qinghe had early admired the true wind, hastening to the Dharma seat. In Weiyang, he transformed and delivered beings; in the desert, he attended his master’s journey, becoming the foremost disciple of Changchun’s gate. When he succeeded his master in presiding over the teachings, he remained humble and unassuming, ultimately shedding worldly toils to pass away in leisurely longevity.

As for one who nurtured the true with tranquility, treated others with benevolence and forbearance, matched outward elegance with inner substance, and combined refinement with sincerity—whose name was weighty and reputation lofty, drawing Daoists and laypeople near and far to prostrate at his hall, fearing only to lag behind—such was our True Perpetual Master.

The Master’s name was Zhichang, styled Haoran. His ancestors hailed from Yongnian in Luozhou. At the end of the Song, they fled to Fanyang in Pu, then later moved to Guancheng in Kai, where they settled and registered. His great-grandfather Hao, grandfather Chang, father Ming, and father Man all concealed their virtue without ostentation, yet were deeply respected by their village.

In the spring of the *guichou* year of the Mingchang era (1193), on the nineteenth day of the first month, his mother, née Nie, dreamed of a strangely attired man presenting her with a jade child. Upon waking, she gave birth to the Master. At two, he lost his father; at six, his mother. He was raised in the household of his uncle Jichuan.

Jichuan, whose name was Meng, was a renowned scholar. Excelling in both poetry and prose, he repeatedly ranked at the top, though despite four attempts at the metropolitan examination, he attained only the status of a *tong jinshi chushen*, leaving him somewhat unsatisfied. Seeing the Master’s exceptional intelligence and outstanding talent, he intended to cultivate him to fulfill his long-held aspirations. Yet the Master disliked literary refinement, favoring instead a life of tranquility. He often silently prayed to the high heavens, hoping to early encounter an extraordinary teacher or worthy friend to fulfill his lifelong aspirations.

At nineteen, his uncle began arranging his marriage. The Master sighed upon hearing this: “I originally aspired to study the Dao, yet I have not even touched its shores. If I become entangled in love and desire, how could I ever achieve the lofty, transcendent endeavors of the ancients?” His fellow student, Zhang Benmin, initially urged him to continue the family line, but upon realizing his resolve was unshakable, they each declared their aspirations and parted ways.

Soon after, he packed his books and staff, embarking on a wandering journey. First, he secluded himself on Laoshan in Donglai, then later moved to the Immortal’s Palace on Mount Tianzhu. The master of the palace, Li Xian of Tangyin, was struck by the Master’s imposing bearing and extraordinary speech, greatly admiring him. When the Master prepared to leave, Li said to him: “You are a vessel of great capacity for the Mysterious Gate. This mountain hermitage is remote and desolate—no place for a prolonged stay. In the past, wherever the Patriarch traveled, extraordinary individuals emerged. Now, only Changchun remains. You should go and follow him. Your future accomplishments cannot be foretold.”

The next day, the Master set out and arrived at Dongshan in Jimo. At the time, the *zhenyou* era (1213–1217) was marked by chaos, with bandits swarming like bees. The mountain had caves that could shelter hundreds. When bandits approached, the people hid inside, but they barred the Master from entering, refusing him. Soon after, he was captured by the bandits, who demanded to know the cave’s location. They tortured him cruelly, and though he fainted, he revived without revealing it. When the bandits withdrew, those who had hidden in the cave emerged, surrounding him in tears to express their gratitude: “We are but petty men. The lives of hundreds depended on your single word, yet you forgot the grievance of being barred and saved us at the cost of your life. Your virtue far surpasses ordinary human sentiment.” They competed to provide for him until he recovered. Even today, the elders still speak of this.

In the summer of the *wuyin* year (1218), the Master heard that Master Changchun had moved from Deng to Lai. He hurriedly prepared and went to pay homage at his seat. The Master was immediately recognized and treated with exceptional favor. Tian Zhuo, the Transport Commissioner of Shandong, esteemed his conduct and, having heard of his past service in Jimo—where General Huang Guo consulted him on strategy to preserve the city—invited him to Yidu with a letter, treating him as an honored guest.

In the winter of the *jimao* year (1219), our dynasty dispatched the plenipotentiary Liu Zhonglu, bearing an edict and gifts, to summon Master Changchun from Donglai. At the time, Zhang Lin, the deputy commander of Yidu, had defected from Jin to Song, his allegiance shifting unpredictably. Fearing he might obstruct the journey, the Master went to persuade Lin to issue a proclamation escorting the imperial carriage, ensuring safe passage. In the spring of the *gengchen* year (1220), the Master finally received the command to depart. Among the eighteen who accompanied him, the Master was one.

In the second month, they reached Yan. The following spring, in the second month, they journeyed northward, and by the seventh month of autumn, they arrived at Mount Abu Khan, nearly ten thousand *li* from Han territory. Along the mountain, a thousand Han households came forth to greet the Master, prostrating in rows, regarding the encounter as a rare opportunity. All entreated him to establish an abbey and select a successor to preside over it.

As the Master prepared to depart, he pointed to the Master [hereafter referred to as "the subject"] among those seated and addressed the assembly: "This one is enlightened, upright, and learned, his knowledge comprehensive. I shall leave him here for you; treat him well." Thereupon, he bestowed upon the subject the Daoist name *Zhenchangzi* and named the abbey *Qixia* ("Resting Clouds"). After the Master had set forth westward, the subject led the assembly in construction, completing the abbey in a matter of days. He also established the *Changchun* and *Yuhua* societies, which remain active to this day.

In the summer of the *guiwei* year (1223), the fifth month, the Master returned from his travels and rested at the abbey. One day, as guests gathered for a vegetarian feast, the Master silently handed the subject a bowstring; the subject, likewise silent, accepted it, coiled it, and wore it at his waist. He then composed a poem in gratitude, to which the Master merely smiled in acknowledgment. Those with discernment understood that the Master’s decision to leave him at Abu Khan and the gift of the bowstring signified an intent to entrust him with succession.

In the seventh month of autumn, the subject accompanied the Master on his return journey. When they reached the Xia River, the lingering heat was still intense. The Master took shelter in the gate tower of an official residence, called the subject by name, and instructed him: "A true master is not easily encountered; one who has attained the Dao is not easily met. Even when met, he is not easily recognized. Those who steadfastly uphold the Dao appear human in form but embody the celestial; their conduct is upright, their essence profound, abiding in the six senses yet rooted in the abyss. They forget hunger and thirst, ever at peace, utterly still, transcending form, and wander alone in the wondrous court of the boundless. Remember these words, and await the day you comprehend them for yourself."

The subject bowed in gratitude. From that moment on, he redoubled his efforts, quieting his mind to embody the true, reverently attending to affairs with principle. Through life and death, through hardship and peril, he never wavered in his resolve.

During the Master’s stay in Yanjing, the subject was privy to all matters concerning the teaching. In the seventh month of autumn in the *dinghai* year (1227), after the Master had ascended to immortality, Qinghe succeeded to the teaching and appointed the subject as *Dudao Lu* (Director of Daoist Affairs), concurrently overseeing the affairs of Changchun Abbey.

In the seventh month of autumn in the *jichou* year (1229), the subject was received by the Emperor at Qianlou Pavilion. At the time, the court had issued an edict summoning scholars well-versed in the classics to instruct the crown prince. The subject presented the *Book of Changes*, the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Dao De Jing*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*, expounding their essential meanings. The Emperor praised him and, in the eleventh month of winter, granted him leave to return.

In the winter of the *gengyin* year (1230), false accusations arose regarding the paintings in Chushun Hall, alleging impropriety. Qinghe was immediately arrested, and the assembly scattered in alarm. The subject alone stepped forward to take his place, declaring: "Qinghe is the lineage master, charged with transmitting the Dao. All matters of the teaching are my responsibility; if there is guilt, it is mine alone, and no other shall bear it." The emissary, admiring his integrity, exempted him from restraints and shackles, though he was still imprisoned. At midnight, the shackles suddenly fell open. The subject informed the jailer, who reattached them, only for them to open again. A jailer reported this to the authorities, and by coincidence, a foreign envoy was dining with them. On the bone of the meat they were eating, the Master’s likeness appeared faintly, and the dispute was thereby resolved.

In the sixth month of summer in the *guisi* year (1233), the subject received an edict to instruct eighteen sons of Mongol nobles in Yanjing. He recommended the Venerable Master Jizhao, Feng Zhiheng, to assist in the endeavor. Day by day, month by month, their talents and skills flourished, earning praise.

In the seventh month of autumn in the *yiwei* year (1235), the subject was ordered to construct a Daoist abbey in Helin. He was entrusted with selecting eminent Daoists to travel there by post carriage. Though Qinghe presided over the teaching, the subject was invariably summoned for audiences and court visits, earning the favor of the throne. He frequently received edicts, and the imperial decrees addressed him as *Xian Kong Bahe Shi* ("Master of the Eightfold Understanding"), *Bahe Shi* being the translated title for "master."

In the first month of spring in the *wuxu* year (1238), Qinghe convened elders from all directions and personally inscribed a document entrusting the subject with succession. Judging that refusal was impossible, the subject accepted. In the third month, the *Duan Shiguan* (Chief Justice of the Grand Court of Appeals) Hutu Hu, acting on imperial command, bestowed upon him the title *Xuanzheng Zhipai Sifa Yanjiao Zhenchang Zhenren* ("Perfected One of True Constancy, Successor of the Orthodox Lineage, Transmitter of the Dao and Teaching").

In the fourth month of summer, the subject journeyed to the capital and memorialized the throne on matters concerning the teaching. He first addressed Lingxu Abbey on Mount Zhongnan, the site where Ancestral Master Chongyang had cultivated the true and initiated the teaching. The Emperor issued an edict bestowing the name *Chongyang Abbey* and ordered its grand reconstruction.

In the first month of spring in the *jiachen* year (1244), the court commanded the subject to conduct a *Putian Dajiao* ("Great Offering for All Under Heaven") at Changchun Abbey, comprising 3,600 altars, and to select practitioners of strict discipline, universally bestowing upon them precepts and registers. By the fifteenth day of the second month in spring of the *wushen* year (1248), the ritual was completed, spanning seven days and nights. Auspicious signs manifested beyond enumeration.

In the *xinhai* year (1251), the first year of the late Emperor’s reign, he desired to observe the rites of sacrifice, offering to the mountains and rivers. In the tenth month of winter, he dispatched an emissary to summon the subject to the capital. The Emperor sat upright upon his throne, personally sealing incense and silently concentrating his thoughts in prayer at the sacrificial site for a long while. He then handed the subject a golden casket and brocade pouch, selecting the attendant Halidan to assist in the journey. He further bestowed 5,000 *liang* of silver from the imperial treasury to cover expenses.

On the day of his departure, the Emperor conferred upon the subject a golden tally and an imperial decree, entrusting him with the oversight of the teaching as before. Upon reaching the sacrificial site, the subject conducted a *Jinlu Jiao* ("Golden Register Offering") for three days and nights. By imperial decree, he bestowed purple robes upon the Daoist assembly who ascended the altar, and rewards were distributed to the officials and subordinates who participated in the ritual. He inquired after the destitute and provided relief according to their needs.

From Mount Heng to Mount Tai, and from Mount Tai to Mount Heng, which lay within Song territory, the subject memorialized the throne, proposing to perform the rites from the Altar of Heaven. He then combined the sacrifices to the four rivers at Jiyuan, concluding with Mount Song and Mount Hua, observing the same rites as at Mount Tai. At the sacrificial sites, many responses and signs were witnessed, which eminent scholars recorded in inscriptions.

In the first month of spring in the *renzi* year (1252), the subject journeyed to the ancestral abbey on Mount Zhongnan to reverently perform the rites. He surveyed and planned the construction, standardizing all abbeys at the foot of the mountain, for this was the root of the teaching.

Upon returning eastward after the full moon of the fourth month, in the *guichou* year (1253), the first month of spring, he received the imperial command to conduct the Grand Golden Register Retreat. Certificates of universal ordination were distributed to Daoist priests and nuns along the routes, with the subject appointed as the Grand Preceptor to seal and authenticate them.

In the *jiayin* year (1254), spring, the throne once more dispatched envoys to perform the Great Universal Offering. The ranks and schedule followed the precedent of the *wushen* year (1248), with the addition of prayers for the deliverance of departed souls throughout the realm. The subject was urged to serve as the Great Master of Salvation, and five hundred taels of gold, five thousand taels of silver, along with ceremonial objects—dragon jades, rings, seals, and pledges of faith—as well as aloeswood, sandalwood, dragon’s spittle, and musk incense, were all provided by the court. From the issuance of the decree to its fulfillment, auspicious omens of phoenixes, cranes, and five-colored clouds appeared in the skies without fail.

The subject further reflected on the long-imprisoned offenders in the Yan region, who, without absolution, could never renew themselves. He petitioned the authorities, and many were pardoned. In the twelfth month of winter, an imperial summons arrived. In the seventh month of autumn in the *yimao* year (1255), he was received by the emperor at the traveling palace. At that time, tribute from the Western Regions was presented, and the crown prince and various princes held a banquet, to which the subject was invited. Once his lodgings were arranged, he was summoned repeatedly and consulted on the arts of governing the state and protecting the people.

On the first day of the twelfth month, the emperor addressed him: "I wish for all the people under heaven to live in peace and contentment, yet I have not seen anyone who shares this heart with me. What should be done?" The subject memorialized: "Since ancient times, when a sagely ruler cherishes the people, men of talent and virtue inevitably respond to his sincerity. By employing the meritorious and the worthy together, the realm may achieve peace and the people security." The emperor praised and accepted his words, ordering them recorded in the annals. From noon until evening, he received the emperor’s inquiries, retiring only when the lamps were lit.

In the *bingchen* year (1256), the first month of spring, he petitioned to retire due to age. In the fourth month of summer, he returned from the northern court. On the last day of the fifth month, the northern eaves of the Zongzhen Pavilion collapsed without cause. On the first day of the sixth month, the *gengshen* day, weary of receiving visitors, he declined all guests and sat in silence, leaning on his armrest. On the *wuyin* day, he straightened his robes and sat upright, saying to those around him: "Last night, the visions were extraordinary. I know my allotted span is complete, and the time of my return has come. The succession of the teaching has already been memorialized to the throne, with Zhang Zhijing of pure clarity appointed as my successor. There is nothing more to discuss." The following day, he entrusted all talismans, seals, and ritual vestments to him, then composed a final hymn, passed away in proper alignment, at the age of sixty-four.

Many of his writings were taken away by others during his lifetime. Only *The Further Mystery Collection* in twenty fascicles and *The Western Journey Record* in two fascicles remain in circulation. Though born into a Confucian family, he later embraced the Dao, serving his master with reverence and treating others with loyalty. He never violated the precepts against meat or wine, not even in the slightest. For twenty years, he oversaw the abbey gates, directing all construction himself. The structures rose in orderly ranks, unmatched in their grandeur. Offerings from devotees across the land flowed in abundantly each year, yet he dedicated all to the common treasury, keeping nothing for himself. On the day of his ascension, he left behind only his robe, staff, and sandals.

His nature was upright and unbending, unwilling to flatter or conform to others’ whims. Thus, slander and lawsuits arose frequently, though they dissolved on their own. He never took offense, instead treating his detractors with sincerity and trust. When parting from his fellow disciple Zhang Junminzhi, each spoke of his aspirations. Zhang later excelled in poetry and prose, achieving high rank, while the subject ultimately became the leader of the Quanzhen Daoist school. After twenty years apart, Zhang, sent on a mission to the north, was detained and disguised himself as a Daoist priest. The subject treated him as an elder brother, as before, and provided for him and his retinue.

At that time, Henan had recently submitted to the dynasty, and many scholar-officials displaced in Yan had concealed themselves among the Daoist registers. The subject extended invitations to them all, feeding dozens daily in the refectory. Some found the task burdensome, but he paid no heed. Such was his sincerity in treating scholars. Among the hundreds of disciples under Changchun’s teaching, he alone recognized Zhang Zhijing’s sincerity from youth, nurturing and guiding him until entrusting him with great responsibility. Such was his clarity in discerning men.

Thus, he served three reigns, receiving ever-increasing favor and trust. Wherever his carriage traveled, north and south alike were moved. The fragrance of incense and the processions of welcome and farewell never ceased. When news of his passing spread, those nearby donned mourning robes and wailed as if they had lost their parents, while those afar set up altars to his departed spirit and wept before them. Truly, his life was glorious, and his death was mourned.

In the *gengshen* year (1280), the fourth month of summer, the present emperor ascended the throne. In the eighth month of autumn in the *xinyou* year (1281) of the Zhongtong era, he was posthumously honored with the title "Perfected of True Constancy, Propagator of the Daoist Teaching, and Perfected Man." The following year, after the full moon of the fifth month of summer, I was avoiding the heat at home when Zhang Zhijing, accompanied by his attendants, arrived at my door. He said: "Our late master rendered great service in continuing the esoteric teaching. Now, nearly seven years have passed since his departure. Without a record of his virtues, we disciples will forever feel shame when we look back. As you and the master were neighbors in the same region, you knew him well. We humbly request this composition."

I declined repeatedly, but within a month, he visited three times, detailing his master’s conduct and the biography composed by the Daoist Li Ding of the Empty Boat. He presented these to me. Observing his deeds, I found them wholly admirable, free of even the slightest trace of deceit or strangeness. Thus, I have arranged what I have seen and heard of him in order and composed this inscription. The inscription reads:

The Dao as teaching
Traces its roots to Laozi,
Neither extravagant nor ostentatious,
Knowing contentment, knowing cessation.

Nurturing nature in the body,
This is Quanzhen.
Refining the plain with culture,
Thus is True Constancy.

Of True Constancy,
Descended from the immortal Li,
Grandson of Chongyang,
Direct heir of Changchun.

Smiling, he received the bowstring,
Transmitting the subtle essence of the teaching.
Establishing Qixia Abbey,
Marking the beginning of his succession.

His words formed chapters,
His actions followed principle.
Sincere in treating scholars,
Stern in disciplining himself.

Ten thousand mouths extolled him,
Three reigns entrusted him.
Virtuous in beginning and end,
Honored in life, mourned in death.

The azure Five Peaks,
The murmuring stream,
Deep and serene the valley,
Where my cap and sandals rest.

Having entrusted the teaching to a worthy successor, we now record his posthumous virtues. Where there is a record, let it be told; where there is a tradition, let it be chronicled. Though the immortal spirit has ascended, the immortal renown endures unceasing. This inscription I compose, that it may stand without shame.

*The Stele of the Daoist Conduct of True Man Yu of the Chongyang Wanshou Palace in the Zhongnan Mountains*

Composed by Yang Huan, Appointed Transport Commissioner of Henan Circuit and concurrently Pacification Commissioner

A jade disk a foot wide, a pearl an inch in diameter—all under heaven know these as treasures, not to be left hidden in mountains or depths unseen. How much more so for a man? Confucius of Lu, whose teachings illumined the ages, was enshrined in the annals of successive dynasties by court historians, alongside the biographies of recluses and hermits. Rightly so, for their legacy has endured unbroken for over a thousand years.

Though I belong to the Confucian tradition, I have long harbored aspirations toward historiography. Carefully examining the deeds of True Man Yu, I find him to be what the ancients called a "founding master." Thus, I inscribe this stele without hesitation.

The Master’s personal name was Shanqing, his courtesy name Boxiang. A native of Ninghai, he was descended from the eminent Yu lineage. His grandfather, Yansheng, served as registrar of Haoshi County, while his father, Daoji, concealed his brilliance and never entered officialdom.

From childhood, the Master abstained from meat. In his youth, he mastered the great meanings of the classics and histories, and developed a profound passion for the study of the Dao, virtue, and the cultivation of life. He was a fellow villager of Ma Danyang. In the twenty-second year of the Dading era, Danyang expounded the teaching at the Golden Lotus Sanctuary, drawing crowds of elders and children alike, among whom the Master was present—then but seventeen. Danyang, struck by his exceptional qualities, sighed and said: "I once feared Master Chongyang’s reprimands and nearly grew weary of the path. Yet it was your father’s steadfastness that allowed me to complete my work. If this child enters the Dao, it will surely be heaven’s repayment to your family." Thereupon, the Master took up staff and mat to follow him.

The following winter, Danyang departed this world. The Master journeyed directly to Longmen Mountain in Longzhou to pay homage to Qiu Changchun. Changchun directed him to study under Changzhen in Luoyang, where he received the method of refining the heart. He begged for alms in Tong and Hua. At the beginning of the Mingchang era, Changchun returned to the eastern seaboard and instructed him: "Your destiny lies in the fertile lands of Long. Do not go elsewhere. A man needs companions to succeed—choose them wisely." The Master then re-entered Qin, selecting a site on the southeastern peak of Mount Wu, where he hewed stone to make his dwelling, eating but one meal a day. Whatever could aid his cultivation, he pursued without the slightest hesitation. For seven or eight years, he severed all ties with the world, until today his abode is known as the Cave of the True Man.

His friend Pu Cha Daoyuan treated him as a teacher. Later, he established an abbey at the Stone Gate in Fenyang. During the Cheng’an era, devotees requested the title "Jade Purity" for his sanctuary and honored him as "Grand Master of Ritual and Mystery." Soon after, he was invested with the register of the Dao to aid in salvation and rescue. From near and far, reverence for him only grew. In the third year of the Taihe era, the prefect of Longzhou bestowed upon him the title "Grand Master of Tranquil Emptiness." In the fifth year, he again visited Changchun to seek confirmation of the mind-seal. Retiring thereafter to Tianping Mountain in Xiangzhou, in the sixth year, Changchun sent Bi Zhichang with a sealed message containing esoteric instructions, urging him to return to the fertile lands of Long and change his name to Zhidao. The Master respectfully complied, studying under Changsheng. In time, his reputation for the Dao flourished, casting radiance upon his age. Even the hoary elders of old confessed themselves his inferiors.

He often said that those who seek immortality must accumulate merit, and that one should respond to others’ crises as if they were one’s own. In the eighth year, upon the triumphant return from the southern campaign, he pitied the captives and spared no effort in ransoming and aiding them until all were saved. In the second year of the Yuanguang era, when chaos erupted in the Long Mountains, Li Chongxu of the Central Taiyi Abbey, hearing of it, offered to take his place, but the Master did not rise. At the beginning of the Zhengda era, the emperor mourned the fallen western troops and dispatched Minister of Rites Zhao Bingwen to offer sacrifices at Pingliang, appointing the Master as Master of Salvation. Bingwen, admiring his integrity, had his portrait presented to the court and summoned him, but again he did not go.

In the second year, famine struck. Someone remarked that the road through Qin and Qi was a vital artery, yet travelers had no refuge, and the year’s provisions were uncertain. The Master replied: "If my gate turns away even one person in distress, how can we speak of generosity?" The speaker bowed in shame and withdrew.

Shortly after, the autumn harvest proved bountiful. He was transferred to the Wuxing Cave-Truth Abbey, where the press of surrounding residences left him no room to withdraw. Imperial envoys arrived in an unbroken stream, and he rose to receive them, thus assuming the affairs of the Central Taiyi Abbey.

In the seventh year, as Henan suffered drought, the emperor summoned his close attendants to escort the Master to offer incense and prayers on the Jiyuan plains. Initially, the ceremony was to be held within the palace, but upon reaching the river, they were halted by contrary winds. The iron anchor sank, yet he ordered the drums struck and the oars plied forward. Upon landing, the wind persisted as before, but sweet rain suddenly fell. A special imperial decree commended his extraordinary merit, and he was concurrently appointed Supervisor of the Five Sacred Peaks’ Protective Spirit Observatories.

In the second year of the Tianxing era, the capital surrendered to our dynasty. Imperial messengers sought eminent Daoists, and the Master was deemed their foremost. In the autumn of the seventh month, he arranged to cross northward via the Zhongluan ford. At the time, famine raged, and many clung to him for refuge. The boatmen, suspecting he carried gold and silk, stealthily drifted downstream. As night reached its midpoint, they encountered a sandy islet, abandoned him there, and departed. At dawn, towering waves surged on all sides, throwing all into panic—until the breach of the Eight Willows Dyke brought calm. Turning to his disciple Fu Daoqing, he said: “Today’s deliverance could only have been achieved by you.” Though Fu, a man of Qin, was uneasy on water, he obeyed with the swiftness of divine aid. Soon, he secured two boats and hastened near, lifting them all from peril—such was his presence in times of crisis.

Passing through Wei, Lu, and Zhao, the feudal lords vied to welcome him beyond their suburbs, their escorts and guards clearing the way before him. Xuantongzi Fan Yuanxi, then revered and entrusted with the Shangqing Abbey in Dongping, heard of his arrival and vacated his seat in deference—rightly so.

In the autumn of the *yiwei* year, he entered Yan and offered sacrifices beneath the Hall of Accordant Submission. There, he encountered Qinghe, who had succeeded to the leadership of the sect, and was treated as an elder brother. In the *bingshen* year, as Yan’s lands suffered drought and locusts, he bowed to public sentiment and cast a talisman into the Lugou River. Rain fell, and the locusts caused no harm.

In the summer of the *wuxu* year, the fourth month, an imperial edict ordered the selection and examination of Daoist and Buddhist clergy nationwide. He was granted the title Perfected of Penetrating Mystery, Vast Virtue, and Cave Truth. In the autumn of the seventh month, the Preceptor Li Zhenchang petitioned for him to reside as abbot of the Chongyang Longevity Abbey on Mount Zhongnan. Coincidentally, the Beijing Prefect Wu had built the Quanzhen Abbey to honor him.

In the *gengzi* year, the Grand Tutor Yila Baojian and the Commander Tian Xiong jointly memorialized, inviting the Master to attend the ancestral burial rites. That very day, he set out for the pass to oversee the abbey’s affairs. Mo Baiyun and Li Wuyu were charged with its administration, while Cao Chonghe and Zhi Yang refined its practices.

In the summer of the *bingwu* year, the fifth month, he journeyed west to Gongchang at the earnest invitation of Magistrate Wang Dezhen. That winter, he lingered in Qinting, where his attendants Liu Zeshu, Wang Daoning, and Jiao Peng served him day and night. Their every movement, silence, and speech were recorded in the *Xizhou Record*.

In the spring of the *dingwei* year, the second month, he returned to the abbey. A Daoist from Yunzhong, Zhang, came to bow before him in the courtyard, but the Master firmly declined the gesture. His attendants said: “Perfected One, your years approach ninety, and disciples fill your hall. To remain in this secluded place is excessive.” He replied: “Etiquette demands reciprocity. ‘Great purity appears tainted; vast virtue seems insufficient’—Laozi spoke thus. If I accepted the bow of a child like Danyang, how could I bear arrogance?”

In the winter of the *gengxu* year, the second day of the tenth month, he bathed and sat upright with solemn composure, as was his daily custom. The following day, he left a verse expressing the principle that life need not be joyful nor death sorrowful. Folding his arm as a pillow, he breathed his last with serene acceptance, aged eighty-five.

Nine days later, he was buried in the northwest corner of the abbey. A collection of his writings, *Hongzhong Ji*, circulated in the world. Feng Bi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of War in Zhenyang, recorded his life in meticulous detail.

During his time in Bian, notable figures included Left Vice Minister Zhang Xingxin, Chief Councilor of State Hou Zhi, Remonstrator Xu Gu, Minister of Rites Yang Yunyi, Marshal of the Royal Household Li Shoujie, Compiler Lei Yuan, and Hanlin Academician Song Jiujia. In Yan, they included Salt Commissioner Chen Changshi, Minister Wu, and Reader-in-Waiting Zhang Ben. In Guanzhong, they included Assistant Director Wang Fuchen, Director Na Bangyong, Lecturer Lai Xianchen, Vice Director of the Tongde Temple Yang Tiande, Vice Director Zhang Hui, Secretary Pei Xian, Librarian Meng Panlin, and Acting Vice Director Zhang Shan. These were the eminent men of the age who admired him—how could one not seek their accounts?

The Master was endowed with celestial *qi*, humble and gentle in demeanor. He seemed aloof yet never haughty, affable yet never frivolous—truly, he defied description. Disciples from all directions numbered beyond count. Even those long in his service never saw joy or anger shape his expression. In his daily life, he remained unchanged through cold, heat, wind, or rain. For sixty-eight years, he never lay fully upon his mat nor loosened his sash—such was his vigilance from beginning to end.

In conversation, he spoke only of rectifying the heart and sincerity of intent. As for the secrets of conserving spirit and nurturing truth, unless one was worthy, he sealed his lips, fearing the harm of forced instruction. His purity and frugality were innate, not cultivated. Even the smallest item, like a pair of socks, might remain unchanged for years—how could he seek the slightest personal gain?

His travels spanned the seas and Mount Tai to the east, reached Xiangyang and Dengzhou to the south, extended to Taozhou and Gongchang to the west, and stretched to Yan and Liao to the north. His extraordinary traces and jade-like deeds are clearly documented.

In the spring following his burial, I retired as Southern Salt Commissioner to Yantai. Wuyu urged his disciples to travel six thousand *li* to earnestly request an inscription. Alas! The transcendent crane does not come; even the green mountains gather dust. In distant remembrance of his mountain retreat, I reluctantly compose this epitaph. The inscription reads:

The Dao and Heaven share a single origin;
Yet arts and techniques diverge in endless profusion.
The Perfected One leaps forth from the sea’s gate—
A true heir of Danyang, a grandson of Chongyang.
Surrounded by mountains and marshes on four sides,
He sits in quiet observation as ten thousand horses gallop.
No creature longs to be a sacrificial vessel;
Only in fire’s blaze is jade’s warmth revealed.
Soaring west, circling east—his movements align with the emperor’s will.
In drought, he receives the edict to succor the river’s source.

Amidst raging torrents and surging waves, whales gape and swallow,
A single talisman cast—even the ancient earth trembles.
Lei and Feng Yi escort the rain chariot,
Parched fields revive as though by mere reversal.

At Zhaona, the souls of the slain weep by night,
Rainbow banners and leopard-tail pennants flutter in profusion.
With a willow branch he waves and scatters, dissolving deep grievances,
Adapting to circumstances, he forgets both purity and turbidity.

Swift as thunder rends the dark, lightning pierces the gloom—
His work complete, he claims no credit, his virtue ever more revered.
Ascending to the azure vault, how lofty his bearing!
The roads are strewn with faces turned away, their old debts forgotten.

The great bell’s toll resounds with profound words,
Encompassing the gardens of Zheng and the groves of Zhuangzi.
Though Lu and Tao diverge in lineage, their bond in righteousness is firm.
My tongue enters the brush, its force palpable—
Crimson script and emerald jade, fragrant with orchid and calamus.

**Epitaph for Perfected True Constancy, Master Li**
*Composed by Zhang Bangzhi, Grand Master for Court Consultation, Hanlin Academician, Co-Drafting Official for Edicts, and Recipient of the Purple Gold Fish-Bag*

The difficulty of pursuing the Dao comprises three essentials: first, awakening to principle; second, propagating the teaching; third, transmitting it to the worthy. He who embodies all these is none other than Perfected True Constancy.

The Perfected One’s learning was what the world calls the *Quanzhen* (Complete Perfection) tradition. This transmission of the Dao was unknown in antiquity; it was first proclaimed by Master Chongyang Wang. Among his disciples, only seven received his transmission: Ma Danyang of Mystic Treasure, his chamber disciple Sun Qingzhen the Unwavering, Tan Changzhen the Penetrating Rectitude, Liu Changsheng the Penetrating Mystery, Qiu Changchun the Penetrating Secrecy, Wang Yuyang the Embodied Mystery, and Hao Guangning the Great Penetration. Thereafter, followers spread across the realm, numbering no fewer than tens of millions, while other teachings waned. How resplendent!

In the Perfected One’s time, Ma had already departed, but Qiu, Liu, Wang, and Hao remained in good health. The Perfected One sought out these four masters, and each, upon meeting him, deemed him teachable. Thus, he unlocked the gates and unlatched the bolts, leaving no obstruction unsevered. The Perfected One gathered subtle wonders, his mind as profound and encompassing as the sea. Nothing was lacking, and so his heart grew ever clearer, his Dao advancing by leaps.

By nature, he loved mountain forests, journeying wherever his inclination led, yet never lingering in one place. He first dwelt in the regions of Yan and Ji, then roamed to Deng, Lai, Song, and the lands of the Yellow River and Qin. Eventually, he settled at Danyang Abbey in Daliang. Wherever he went, disciples flocked to him, and those wishing to receive his teachings came without cease. The Perfected One welcomed all, providing food and instruction without a trace of weariness. Thus, each felt they had gained something, and their devotion grew ever firmer.

One day, the Perfected One sent a messenger to the Five Families of Na, inviting Yu Gong Boxiang to preside over the Central Great One Abbey. He declared: “Yu is my friend—his bearing is free and untrammeled, his understanding vast and unconstrained. He wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, unwilling to let others know. This is what my late master, Perfected Changchun, secretly entrusted to him. He who will one day revive our teaching—is it not this man?”

In the spring of the *guisi* year, the Great Court dispatched envoys to summon the Perfected One. Having received the command and prepared for his journey, the day of departure arrived. Suddenly, he turned to his followers and said: “Heaven is about to revive the ancient Dao, yet I shall not live to see it. The reason I invited Yu was precisely for this day.” Thereupon, he entrusted his later affairs to Yu and asked: “Has the sun reached noon?” His attendant replied: “It is noon.” Then, resting his head upon his arm, he passed away, aged eighty-three.

The Perfected One’s virtue flourished among men. His personal name was Zhiyuan, his surname Li; *True Constancy* was the honorific bestowed by his master, Perfected Qiu. Other marvelous deeds of his are recorded in detail by eminent figures of the age, and so I shall not repeat them here.

**Inscription:**
Of old, Chongyang proclaimed this *Quanzhen*,
Who inherited, who transmitted? Seven were the founders.
When it came to the Perfected One, he convened with the masters,
Revealing the subtle, elucidating the obscure, even in the southern frontier.
His fame reached the heavens; the Great Court summoned him.
Having received the command and returned, he suddenly ascended afar.
The Perfected One once said: “Yu of Ninghai—
he who will one day revive the teaching, is it not this man?”
His words were always fulfilled, like echo answering sound.
His foreknowledge arose from utmost sincerity.
In life, he was renowned; in death, his legacy endures.
Compared to the ancients, he was nearly complete.
On the southern slope of Yi Mountain, by the banks of the Bian River,
I carve this inscribed verse, that it may endure.

**Epitaph for Master Departed Peak, Yu**
*Composed by Yuan Haowen of Yishan*

One who spoke of the *Quanzhen* way, Wei Zhiyi, described the conduct of his master, Departed Peak, and requested that I compose an epitaph for his tomb. He began: “When my master, Departed Peak, served Master Longevity Liu, he was not yet twenty but already strove with austerity. He begged for food in the regions of Qi and Lu, never disdaining even spoiled or discarded fare, the remnants of flies and maggots. He made no plans to build a dwelling or settle in one place. In cities and along roads, when dusk fell, he would stop, heedless of wind, rain, cold, or heat.

Our *Quanzhen* tradition forbids sleep, calling it the ‘refinement of the yin demon.’ Among advanced practitioners, some have not touched a mat for decades. My master, Departed Peak, while begging in Xuchang, lodged at the Yue Temple. All night, he walked swiftly, circling the city walls several times—this was his daily practice. Such was his endurance.

Once, he stood by a city gate when a great cart laden with medicinal herbs passed by. The scent struck his nose, and suddenly, as if awakened, he leapt for joy, unable to contain himself. A certain elder teacher locked him in an empty chamber for three days before releasing him.

Though he had never studied books, from that day on, he recited hundreds of words daily. When shown the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi, he read and expounded upon them as if splitting bamboo. Within a few years, he mastered both inner and outer learning. When composing songs and poems, he would take up brush and paper as if without premeditation, yet all were incisive and aligned with principle. Scholars to this day transmit them.

His bearing was imposing, his capacity vast. Worldly praise or blame did not touch his heart, yet when it came to aiding the distressed and succoring the needy, he was ever anxious, as if he could never do enough.

After the southward crossing, the esteem for the Dao rose in his time. The noble and refined of the capital, hearing of the master’s name, hastened to serve him, vying to become his disciples. In the *Zhengda* era, he was appointed by imperial decree to oversee the Taiqing Abbey in Bozhou and was granted the title *Master of Purple Emptiness*.

Such was the life of Departed Peak. His disciples now intend to bury him at the Longevity Abbey in Luoyang. You once promised to compose his epitaph, and I am fortunate to fulfill it at last.

When I was in Sanxiang, I once saw Departed Peak among a crowd. Later, when I served in the southeast, he delighted in associating with our circle, and I wished to inquire into his knowledge but never had the chance. Moreover, Wei has sought my writing for years. Now, he has traveled hundreds of *li* from Liaocheng to Ji, waiting for months.”

Illness has left me #2 sluggish with brush and ink. If there were doubts about the master, what doubts could I have of Departed Peak? I have heard that among today’s people, the Quanzhen Dao draws from the inquiries of the Lao-Buddhist traditions, and so its adherents endure cold and hunger, emaciation and suffering, branding and mutilation, like withered ascetics. Yet when they attain realization, moved by the stirrings of forests, waters, birds, bamboo, trees, tiles, and stones, they break free with sudden clarity, their bonds and precepts dissolving of themselves, their mind’s light blazing forth to illumine the six directions—no different from ascetics who have attained the Way.

Thus I have often reasoned: practice and principle proceed together; where there is this principle, there is this practice. Yet there are also cases where this principle is absent, yet this practice remains. In compiling the *Sequel to the Record of the Listener*, I encountered several individuals who, though untrained in even the rudiments of composition, suddenly produced hymns or eulogies, their words flowing freely to plumb the depths of principle. If even fishermen and peddlers can achieve this, how much more those whose every thought is fixed on the Dao?

Academician Zhang Minzhi, an old acquaintance of Departed Peak, once remarked of his songs and poems: though the master himself dismissed such words as the Dao’s cast-off trifles, what endures of them reveals how often this old man shed his skins amid the dust of the forest’s hundred cares. He also said: “Loosed like the sighing of wind, echoing like the valley’s response—those who would measure me by rules and standards are like one who imposes the tones of the pentatonic scale upon the sounds of nature, or demands that the formless be painted in colors.”

My friend Sun Boying, a renowned scholar of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, studied under Gao Xianchen while at the Imperial Academy. Men like Lei Xiyan, Xin Jingzhi, and Liu Jingxuan were among the finest under heaven, yet Boying, moving in their company, stood out sharply, unwilling to lag behind. Upon meeting the master, he at once became his disciple, facing north to serve him, and ultimately took the yellow cap to the end of his days. Both Zhang, whom I revere, and Sun, whom I cherish, acted thus—what doubts could I have of Departed Peak?

And so I compose this inscription.

Departed Peak’s personal name was Daoxian. He was born into the Yu clan of Wendeng. At first, he secluded himself at Peach Blossom Flat near the Woman’s Ford at Guanjin. Passing through Luoyang, he found his master Liu’s former retreat, the thatched hut, and made it his own—this was the Longevity Abbey. He resided at the Taiqing Abbey for three years, then fled the *renchen* year’s warfare to Lushi. The Duke of Qishui welcomed him and settled him in Deng, but soon after, he fell ill and died at the age of sixty-five. *Departed Peak* was the name he gave himself.

**Inscription:**
Dividing fowl and swine to eat,
Dwelling where dormice and vipers roam,
He saw the body as a bandit’s twig,
And dried himself in the net of *mailuo*.

Did joy ever increase for him? Could age be turned back? What he upheld was narrow, yet what he gained was lavish. Was there no one to emulate the recluse who dwelt in the river’s bend—clad in bark and grass, summoning celestial harmony? Yet when one strains too fiercely, how can the snapped string be mended?

The difficulty of mastering the Dao draws sighs from all. Daily strife—like the quarrels of mother and daughter-in-law—brings ruin in its wake. A thousand days’ effort may be undone by a hair’s breadth of error. Those who shun peril for ease, forsake substance for splendor, or offer jade before horses, cannot escape the mockery of thieves. But such a man as he was neither eroded by the current nor worn thin by grinding. He began by drawing the bow of shared *qi* and ended by making the Great Square his home.

Though he shed his bones here, who is to say he does not now wear the azure clouds as his crown and the flying rosy mists as his girdle?

**Stele Inscription for the Daoist Adept of Vast Mystery, Master Zhao**

Composed by Li Qian, Hanlin Academician, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History

In the spring of the *gengchen* year of the Zhiyuan era, the seventy-first year after the Adept of Vast Mystery’s ascension, his dharma-heir, Xing Moyan, known as Dao’an, abbot of the Chongyang Longevity Abbey at Zhongnan’s Reclining Yang, recounted the master’s deeds and dispatched a disciple to the capital to request this stele inscription. Tracing the origins and lineage, I have composed this preface and inscription.

The Adept’s personal name was Wuxuan, his courtesy name Zishen. He was born into the Zhao clan of Lingkou in Lintong. His mother carried him for twelve months; he was born in the first year of the Tiande era of the Jin, on the night of the startling ginger—his chamber filled with radiant light, astonishing his parents. Orphaned young, he served his mother, Lady Wei, with such filial devotion that he was widely praised. His nature was serene and detached; he cast aside all worldly desires.

Upon reaching adulthood, he read widely and grasped the great principles of the classics. At that time, the Quanzhen teachings were just beginning to flourish, and the Adept, having heard of them, turned his heart toward them. When the first patriarch, Chongyang, passed away, Master Danyang Ma escorted his remains westward. Passing through Lingkou, the Adept welcomed him into his home and honored him with utmost reverence. Observing that the Adept possessed the capacity to receive the Dao, Danyang spoke with him, and they formed an immediate bond. The next day, when Danyang was begging in the markets of Chang’an, the Adept took out a hundred strings of cash to support him. Returning home, he said to his mother, “How long is a human life? To be submerged in worldly affairs is but vain toil. Better to cast aside mundane concerns, dwell in the gate of the Mystery, and thereby awaken to principle, clarify one’s nature, and penetrate the Dao.” His mother replied, “If this is truly your aspiration, I shall go with you.” Thus, the whole family entered the Dao and sought out Danyang at Liujiang in Zhongnan, becoming his disciples. Through daily intimacy with his master, Danyang taught him the arts of quieting the mind and nurturing his nature, and he gradually gained insight.

A man of Chang’an, Zhao Enxu, offered his residence, and there they built a simple abode of four walls. Master and disciples dwelt within—this is the present-day Penglai Abbey. For several years, the Adept sat in silent meditation, his mind and surroundings growing ever clearer, until the ultimate principle flowed through him, and he gained much from Danyang’s teachings. Later, when Danyang journeyed east, a man from Jishan named Duan Mingyuan further explored the profound subtleties of the Dao. Danyang rejoiced, saying, “In Guanzhong, we have Zhao Wuxuan, and east of the river, we have Duan Mingyuan. Our teaching has found its heirs.” Thereafter, those in Guanzhong who aspired to the Dao deeply regretted not having the chance to meet him.

The Li family of Chunhua in Dengzhou built a refined retreat for the Adept to reside in. There, he cut four cypress saplings and planted them in the courtyard, reciting a few verses to express the meaning of planting a virtuous root. The cypresses took root and flourished, remaining lush to this day. During the Taihe era, a man from Fanchuan named Wei Liulang served the Adept with great reverence. His younger brother, who lived in the city, often saw a Daoist sitting beside him in a teahouse. One day, when visiting his elder brother in Fanchuan and hearing how highly his brother regarded the Adept, he accompanied him to pay his respects. Upon seeing the Adept’s face, he recognized him as the Daoist from the teahouse. He told his brother, who realized the Adept had never left, and thus deepened his faith. He then donated his villa in Zhuangcun at Boshan to build a hermitage for the Adept. When the hermitage was completed, it was named Quandao. The Adept also said to his disciple Ran Yiqui, “The Yanxiang Abbey in Jingzhao is where the Dao Ancestor, the Most Venerable Primordial One, revealed his traces. Formerly, Master Danyang built a hall beside it, and in time, it will become a grand sanctuary of blessed prosperity. You should reside there.” The Adept himself frequently visited, and over the years, the abbey expanded and flourished, becoming a renowned sanctuary.

In the spring of the ren-shen year of the Da’an era, the Adept visited his ancestral tomb to pay his respects, accompanied by his disciples. Along the way, they heard a sound in the empty sky, like the harmonious playing of music, which all present heard. The Adept composed a song to commemorate this marvel, but only completed half before instructing his disciple Lu Xianqi to remember it. At that time, his disciple Li Daobao was returning from Luoxi and suddenly encountered the Adept on the road. The Adept said, “You must hasten on your way, for I am about to depart.” With these words, he vanished. When Li Daobao reached Shaan, he encountered the Adept again, who said, “Earlier, I composed a song but did not finish it. Now I have completed it—do not forget it.” When Li Daobao arrived in Chunhua, the Adept had already returned to the True. Li Daobao told the other disciples what he had seen, and when they combined his words with what Lu Xianqi had recorded, the song was complete. All were astonished.

The Adept lived sixty-three years in this world and styled himself Liaozhenzi. The following year, he was buried at Quandao Hermitage on Boshan. Yang Tingxiu, Vice Commissioner of Pingdong Prefecture, composed the inscription for his tomb. Later, the National Preceptor and Master of Teachings, Qinghe Yin, paid homage at the shrine. Observing that the cliffside was too steep and narrow to accommodate a grand hall, he ordered his disciples to clear the slope below and rebuild, naming it Cuiwei Abbey in honor of the Adept. Minister of Perpetual Constancy Li posthumously bestowed upon him the title “Adept of Vast Mystery.”

The Adept was profoundly learned in the mysterious arts. What is called refining the elixir and nurturing one’s nature, the inner and outer visions of the *Yellow Court*—he grasped these in his heart and expressed them in speech, composing songs and verses. Among them are the *Ninety-Nine Poems* and the *Song of Non-Birth*, all collected in the *Ladder of Immortals* and transmitted among Daoist circles. The people of the eastern mountains called him “Little Danyang.”

Early on, when the Adept resided west of the Wei River, he rose one morning and called his disciples together, saying, “Thirty years from now, the Daoist teaching will flourish greatly. There will be a patriarch who spreads its transformation, and his disciples will fill the world. Strive diligently!” When Master Qiu Changchun later answered the summons of the Sagely Martial Emperor Taizu, it came to pass just as the Adept had foretold. All marveled at his perfect sincerity and foresight, his stillness that enabled response.

His disciples were many, but the most worthy and accomplished were Qingpinzi Wang Deyu, Xidengzi Ran Yiqui, and Mingweizi Wang Zhiqing. The heir of Qingpinzi was Lü Zhizhen; the heir of Xidengzi was Zhang Daoxing; and Mingweizi transmitted his teachings to Li Zhijiu, who now oversees the affairs of Cuiwei Abbey.

**Inscription:**
The Daoist lineage traces back to the Primordial One,
With the Great Void as its chamber and stillness as its gate.
A spirit unclouded by dust’s obscuring gloom,
Expansively perceives the root of heaven and earth.

At first, its source flowed pure,
But in later ages, branches diverged.
With talismans, exorcisms, and prohibitions—how they multiplied!
The Primordial One’s perfect teaching nearly vanished.

The Quanzhen arose a hundred years ago,
Weak yet strong, humble yet exalted.
Non-action yet action—its wondrous function complete,
Silent yet speaking—the true principle abides.

After Chongyang, a host of scattered immortals
Aided and propagated its Way.
Among them, Danyang grasped the true essence—
Who could succeed him? The Vast Mystery.

In youth, untangled by love and desire’s snares,
He fled the world and entered Zhongnan’s mountains.
In a walled abode, he sat in serenity, casting off a hundred cares,
His inner light shining like a limpid deep.

In Guanzhong, his Daoist repute spread like orchids and irises,
Patrons vied to donate wealth and land to invite him.
They built hermitages to secure his fragrant, enduring legacy—
A dharma-heir now appears, the transmission revived.

The cypress of Chunhua soars to the heavens,
The Azure Micro-Palace pierces the clouds and mist.
Riding the wind, mounting the qi, he returns to nature—
Only his wondrous traces remain, illuminating Fanchuan.

**Epitaph for Yang Bixu, the Perfected of Azure Emptiness of Mount Zhongnan**
*Composed by Liu Zuqian, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Glorious Consultation, Co-Director of the Imperial Chancellery, Superior Grand Master of the Light Chariot, Baron of the Pengcheng Commandery with a fief of seven hundred households, granted the Purple Gold Fish-Bag*

In the early years of Mingchang, when I was but fourteen or fifteen,
I studied in Chang’an and heard that the Dao-attained Master Sheepskin
had already ascended in the Proclamation Hall of the prefectural yamen.
There remained the Master Paper-Robe, who dwelled there—
I saw him many times.
Yet in my youthful ignorance, I could not recognize his extraordinary nature.

By the end of Taihe, when I obtained an official post at Hu,
someone spoke of Yang Bixu, who transmitted the Dao of Patriarch Wang,
his name resounding throughout Guanzhong—
he was none other than the Master Paper-Robe of former days.

The Master’s name was Mingzhen, his sobriquet Bixuzi.
A native of Zhaoquli in Sanyuan, Yaozhou, his family had long tilled the soil.
Of four brothers, all entered the Dao—he was the eldest,
while the second, Shoujue, survived; the others passed early.

The Master first studied under Ma Danyang,
then journeyed to Shandong to meet Masters Qiu and Wang,
traveling to and fro in the Southern Mountains via the Proclamation Hall.
Between Cheng’an and Taihe, many disciples flocked to him.
At that time, the two military governors of Shaanxi—both imperial clansmen—
successively honored him as their teacher.

The Transport Commissioner, Grand Master for Glorious Consultation Gao,
suddenly fell ill with heart pain, and no treatment proved effective.
The Master applied qi and massage, curing him instantly.
In gratitude, Gao composed ten quatrains.
Though the Master was unlettered, he responded extemporaneously,
his verses flowing without pause. Gao marveled, declaring:
*“This Master alone transmits the Patriarch’s essential teachings.”*

Clad in a paper robe and straw sandals, his form as plain as earth or wood,
now singing, now dancing, at times seeming mad or foolish,
he taught techniques for nurturing life and pacifying the mind.
Thus did officials, nobles, and scholars revere him.

Daoists and layfolk alike looked up to him—
questions met with instant answers,
poems and hymns accumulating in moments,
each response satisfying every heart.

In the second year of the Zhengda era, on the Clear and Bright Festival, he instructed his disciple Li Zhichang to prebuild a funerary stupa at the ancestral grave. Indeed, in the sixth month of the tenth year, he passed without illness at the age of eighty. His collected songs and poems, numbering over three hundred, were titled *The Chang’an Anthology*.

Previously, his second disciple Shougui had received the transmission and certification from the Master and thus resided in Fengxiang. One day, seeking timber from the former prefect Mu Hu, he suddenly closed his eyes. As disciples prepared to enshroud him, the townspeople, astonished, gathered in the tens of thousands. Two Daoist disciples quarreled bitterly before him, their dispute long unresolved. Suddenly, the sound of wood being struck rang out, and he lifted his head once more, admonishing: *“Will you lot sell me for profit? Seal the coffin swiftly, or none shall remain.”* Within days of his burial, northern troops swiftly arrived, and the city gates indeed stood unbarred. Only then did the townspeople comprehend. This account appears in the funerary stele of Military Commissioner Lu Tongyi.

Alas! That a single family should produce two such enlightened figures—how extraordinary!

Zhichang, noting that his Master’s expansive deeds lacked an inscription, requested one. Thus, the inscription reads:

The worldly chase fame and gain,
their bodies ensnared in silk, their palates dulled by rich fare.
Qi fails to fill within, and their nature is harmed;
the One True suddenly scatters like mist.
They deem the paper robe madness,
yet who knows the jade within shines ever bright?
Inverting yin and yang, they endure unperishing,
soaring to the divine capital to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

Once, tending the furnace to refine the elixir, he tasted it in secret—
his disciple today is Li Zhichang.

*Stele Inscription on the Conduct of Perfected Zhou of Quanyang of Mount Zhongnan*
Composed by Li Daoqian, the Celestial Music Daoist of Junxi
In the autumn of the jiaxu year of the Zhiyuan era, in the ninth month on the day of renwu, Wu Zhiheng, Supervisor of the Chongyang Abbey of Perfected Accomplishment on Mount Zhongnan, came to the Junxi Ancestral Courtyard at Liujiang. Bowing deeply, he said: *“My late Master, Perfected Zhou of Quanyang, was eminent in Dao, illustrious in virtue, vast in fortune, and profound in blessing. I beseech you to compose an inscription for the stele, that his legacy may endure for posterity.”* I, lacking talent, declined. Yet, consulting the *Golden Lotus Record* preserved in the repository, the funerary inscription by Li Junrui of Kongtong, and the accounts of Perfected Master of Cavernous Truth Yu Changsheng regarding the Master’s words and deeds, I compiled this record.

The Master’s surname was Zhou, his given name Quandao. His family, once a prominent house of ancient You, lost its genealogical records in the chaos, so his lineage remains undetailed. Born on the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the yichou year of the Huangtong era, from childhood his speech and silence, his movements, were those of a mature man. His appearance was remote and archaic, his spirit refined and serene. Orphaned young, his livelihood grew meager, yet he exerted himself to serve his mother. When she suddenly fell gravely ill, unresponsive to all treatments, he cut flesh from his thigh to prepare medicine. Her illness then abated, and his filial piety became renowned in the village.

Upon reaching adulthood, a townsman offered his daughter in marriage, but the Master gently declined. When his mother passed, he mourned beyond propriety, nearly consuming his own vitality. Sighing, he said: *“I have heard Daoists say: ‘If one child attains the Dao, nine generations ascend as immortals.’ To repay boundless gratitude, what could surpass this?”*

In the guisi year of the Dading era, hearing that Master Danyang of the Quanzhen lineage dwelt at the Zhongnan Ancestral Hermitage, propagating the true teachings, the Master journeyed directly to his seat and sought the essentials of the Dao. Danyang accepted him, placing him among his disciples. From gathering firewood to hulling grain, all tasks he performed personally. The Master served with reverence and diligence, unwavering for years. Danyang, perceiving his resolve to receive the Dao, one day summoned him into the ring of disciples and transmitted the true instructions, bestowing upon him the name Quanyangzi.

Having obtained the teachings, the Master mastered himself and refined his heart, practicing what he had received. For years thereafter, the entire assembly marveled at the sincerity of his conduct. Soon after, Danyang said to him: *“Deng lies near the frontier, where the teachings are difficult to spread. You must reside there to propagate our Dao.”* The Master obeyed and departed. Selecting a hermitage at the foot of Yufeng Mountain, he cultivated his spirit, amassed virtue, and accumulated merit. To sons he taught filial piety; to younger brothers, obedience. To the greedy, he preached frugality; to the timid, resolve. Adapting to each one’s capacity, he enlightened all. For the sick, the disabled, the violent, the solitary, the widowed, and the destitute—those without refuge—he provided shelter in the hermitage. Thus, the gentry and commoners of the region grew ever more reverent, and the people of Deng turned toward goodness.

In the renyin year, Danyang’s crane-borne spirit departed. Each year on the Clear and Bright Festival, the Master personally journeyed to the Zhongnan Ancestral Courtyard to offer sacrifices, making this an annual observance. During the Zhenyou era, when the Qiang people overran He, the Master was among the captives. Though bound, his devotion to the Dao never wavered. The Qiang, recognizing him as an extraordinary man, released him.

Thereafter, those from all directions who came to his gate seeking instruction and transmission filled the space beyond his door with sandals. He ordained over a thousand disciples, each established in their own place, guiding and nurturing later generations. At the end of the Yuanguang era, Zhang Xinfu, Left Assistant Director of the Department of State Affairs, governed Deng Prefecture. Though he had long been wary of the Master’s reputation, one day he visited the hermitage to inquire about his practices. The Master expounded on the principles of morality, nature, and destiny. Zhang, moved by his sincerity, declared upon leaving: *“Zhou Quanyang is a man of the Dao.”* The next day, he hosted a vegetarian feast and presented the Master with robes and shoes. Thereafter, he frequently sent messengers to inquire after his well-being, and the Master, in turn, visited him, lodging at the Temple of Emperor Gaozu of Han in Chang’an County. The Military Commissioner, Lord Wanyan, treated him with the reverence due a master.

In the wuzi year of the Zhengda era, he returned to He. On the seventeenth day of the tenth month, he instructed the assembly to prepare a vegetarian feast. Summoning his Dharma heir, Yuanmingzi Li Zhiyuan, and his foremost disciples, he charged them: *“The Living Dead Man’s Tomb in Nanshi Village of Zhongnan is where the Patriarch opened the path to refine the true. I wish to restore it to honor the immortal’s traces, but the times are such that this cannot be forced. When peace returns, you must each strive to fulfill my aspiration.”*

Having spoken these words, he instructed his attendant to burn incense and directed the assembly to recite the *Classic of Purity and Tranquility*. Seated upright in solemn stillness, the Master listened intently. As the third recitation drew to a close, he rested his head upon his left arm and passed away, having lived eighty-four springs and autumns. He was interred beside Jade Peak Hermitage.

A scholar named Wang Caiqing, an intimate friend of the Master, was then serving in Qingyang. As the imperial troops besieged the city with mounting urgency, Wang suddenly dreamed of the Master, clad in plain robes and leaning on a patterned staff, arriving at his gate to say: *“I have come especially to bid you farewell. The trappings of office are but fleeting lodgings—one cannot cling to them long. Once this body is lost, to regain it would be most difficult. Take care and depart.”* Soon after, the siege was lifted. Wang inquired among others and learned that the day the Master appeared in his dream was the very day he had returned to the True. Thereupon, Wang resigned his seal and cords of office, renounced his wife and children, and devoted himself to the Dao for the remainder of his days.

In the *wuwu* year of the Cheng’an era, a man from Donglu named Zhang Zhiyuan, styled Master Void-Penetrating, once dreamed twice of divine beings brandishing white blades, rebuking him: *“Your years are nearly spent—why do you not seek a master to study the Dao and escape swift death?”* Awakening in a daze, his spirit unsettled, he wandered to the western outskirts of the city to ease his mind. There, he encountered a Daoist in hempen robes and straw sandals, his frame tall and imposing, drifting westward. Approaching him, the Daoist said: *“You bear karmic affinity from a past life; thus, I have come to receive you.”* Beneath the shade of a roadside tree, he taught Zhang the secret oral instructions for refining lead and mercury, then untied a hempen cord from his waist and bestowed it upon him, saying: *“Hold this in reverence; do not forget my teaching. Thirty years hence, a disciple of my lineage will come here to meet you. At that time, you shall truly join with the master’s reality and forge a great karmic bond.”* When Zhang asked his name, he replied: *“I am Zhou Quanyang of Guanzhong.”* Then he vanished. Zhang, awakened to the truth, thereupon changed his robes and entered the Dao. Later, in Jizhou, he established White Cloud Abbey, ordaining hundreds of disciples and founding hermitages and abbeys throughout the Qi and Lu regions.

In the *renchen* year, as the Six Armies advanced into Henan, Li Yuanming led his followers north across the river and built Hermitage of Resting in the True in Donghe County as their dwelling. Hearing of this, Zhang traveled to meet him and recounted his past encounter with the Master. Yuanming produced a portrait of the Master, and Zhang, burning incense and bowing, declared: *“This is indeed the master I met long ago!”* They immediately recognized each other’s transmission, and Zhang acknowledged Yuanming as his elder Daoist brother.

In the *yiwei* year, as Guanzhong was just pacified, Yuanming, mindful of the Master’s dying charge, led over a hundred of his Dharma heirs and disciples westward. In Nanshi, they established the Palace of Chongyang’s Attainment of the Dao. Zhang Void-Penetrating repeatedly conveyed gold and silk to support the endeavor. In less than a decade, the grand structures stood resplendent and imposing. In the *xinchou* spring, after the Perfected One of Pure Harmony had completed the Master’s funeral rites, he commanded his disciples to bear the Master’s immortal casket and inter it in the Immortal’s Shed Garden of Liu and Jiang.

In the *renzi* year, by imperial decree, Master True Constancy Li bestowed upon Quanyang the posthumous title Perfected One of Vast Virtue and Transformative Teaching. The Master was compassionate and merciful toward all beings, cherishing the destitute and the poor. In his own conduct, he was frugal and unassuming, yet generous in his offerings. He maintained humility and modesty, never presuming precedence over others. His mastery of conserving qi and nurturing spirit was a daily practice, never for a moment neglected. When circumstances called for him to uphold and propagate the teaching, he followed the natural course of things. His disciples gathered like spokes to a hub, and the powerful and eminent revered him—not through scheming, but by the inherent power of his virtue. Wherever his abbeys and Daoist sanctuaries stood, they flourished with accomplishment. Though he sat motionless for days on end, his presence was solemn and dignified, without a trace of indolence. Yet when one approached him, his warmth was like the sun nurturing all things, leaving visitors spiritually empty when they came but fulfilled when they departed.

He embodied the Three Treasures of the Old Master and the true conduct of the Perfected One of the *Southern Florescence*, possessing both in full measure. Could he not be called a paragon of the sagely gate?

An inscription is appended:

Alas, Quanyang!
Pillar of the Mystic Gate,
His nature noble and bright,
His celestial disposition manifest.
With the integrity of pine and bamboo,
The resolve of iron and stone,
He cast off worldly bonds to seek the Dao’s essence,
Adapting to the flourishing of the profound transformation.
As the lineage master of the Three Topknots,
He received the sacred writ.
His mind was deep and luminous,
His qi vast and unyielding.
His spirit abode in serene majesty,
Radiating celestial light.
In seven years, his heart aligned with the sagely teaching;
In nine, he merged with the mystery of true constancy.
Answering the call, he journeyed,
Propagating the Dao in his homeland.
The people of Bin first offered sustenance—
Was it not like the five libations?
Manifesting divine transformations to awaken Zhang,
Entering dreams to bid Wang farewell,
He rode the primal qi of the vast expanse,
Soaring freely across the eight directions.
Roaming the Purple Palace,
Feasting in the Flowery Hall,
Paying homage to the Supreme Emperor,
Venerating the Primal Sovereign,
Merging with the Great Void beyond measure,
Equal to the boundless kalpas.
Disciples and Daoist companions
Will never forget him.
They built shrines and enshrined his image,
Offering evening lamps and morning incense,
Inscribing his legacy in enduring stone,
That his fragrance may be transmitted for ten thousand generations.

**Epitaph for the Tomb of Perfected One Universal Illumination, Master Void-Penetrating of the Range Clan**

Composed by Song Ziqing of Shangdang

The Master’s personal name was Yuanxi, of the Fan clan, styled Void-Penetrating, a native of Ninghai. Endowed with innate wisdom, he could recall events from the time of his birth. As a youth, upon witnessing the slaughter of a pig, he ceased eating meat. During his mother’s mourning, he dwelled in the open beside her grave; for his father’s, he donned mourning attire and visited daily, undeterred even by violent storms. Though he studied the Confucian classics in his youth and delighted in perusing books and records, he sought only to grasp their essential meaning.

At nineteen, he became a disciple of Hao Taigu in the Complete Perfection tradition. Taigu held him in high esteem, secretly transmitting esoteric instructions and entrusting him with the affairs of the abbey. The abbey’s surplus funds amounted to nearly a million strings of cash, all left to his discretion without oversight. Soon after, Taigu departed this world. The remaining disciples, coveting the wealth, plotted to harm the Master. Upon hearing this, he merely smiled and said: *“I merely safeguard these for the community—why go to such extremes?”* He immediately handed over the keys and accounts, then departed for Jiaoxi with a flick of his sleeves.

Severing all worldly concerns, he secluded himself in a walled chamber, delving into the study of essence, qi, and spirit. Later, he relocated to Mizhou, where the people held him in profound reverence and faith.

In the early years of the Zhenyou era, the Red Bandits rose in rebellion. Many wealthy families of Donghai entrusted their treasures to the Master. When the city fell and the bandits breached its walls, he judged the situation untenable and distributed all his holdings to appease their chieftains—thus sparing countless lives, both old and young. After the bandits withdrew, the surviving populace acclaimed him as their leader and restored the city’s defenses.

Previously, an edict had stipulated that any who could restore a prefecture or county would be named its magistrate. When the appointment arrived, the Master firmly declined, saying: *“What use has a Daoist for such a post?”* Instead, he was granted the titles of Master of Universal Illumination and Daoist Rectifier of the Prefecture, which he accepted.

As chaos engulfed Shandong, he traveled from Dongping into Qinhuai, ascended Mount Taihang, and descended Liao Mountain to reach Xingtai. By then, Xingtai had already submitted to the new dynasty, and he followed suit. Soon after, he was transferred to Zhaozhou, where he enclosed himself within walls and remained secluded. After a year, learning that Qiu Changchun had received the imperial summons to journey south, he traveled to Yanshan to pay his respects. There, he received profound approval and was appointed Inspector of Daoist Affairs for the Hejian, Zhen, and other circuits.

During Wu Xian’s rebellion, he led his disciples in flight to Mount Tai. In the bingxu year, Yan, the Grand Marshal of Dongping, invited him to oversee the reconstruction of the Supreme Clarity Abbey of Myriad Longevities. He was named Chief Inspector of Daoist Teachings, and the Grand Marshal frequently sent envoys to inquire after his well-being or sought his counsel in person—his courtesy and solicitude unmatched. The Master, in turn, forthrightly expounded on matters of advantage and harm, never yielding, and thereby greatly aided the governance of the Grand Marshal’s administration.

After twelve years of accumulation, with the abbey’s affairs gradually settled, he journeyed eastward to the coast, paying homage at the Shrine of the Grand Primordial. There, he first visited the ancestral tombs, then proceeded directly to Zhen Prefecture to construct the Abbey of the Grand Primordial. He also restored the Tianning Abbey in Zhao Prefecture, frequently traveling between them.

In the wushen year, an imperial decree bestowed upon him the title "Perfected of Mystic Penetration, Vast Salvation, and Universal Illumination." He firmly declined, refusing to accept. That same year, he traveled to Guanzhong to offer sacrifices to Ancestral Master Chongyang at Zhongnan. The Grand Preceptor and Commander of Qin and Long, the Duke of Pu, was by nature haughty and had never deigned to honor scholars. Yet upon meeting the Master, he unconsciously knelt, and thrice sent petitions entreating him to serve as Inspector of the Chongyang Abbey of Myriad Longevities. The Master demurred, citing advanced age and inability to manage affairs, but the Commander ordered the officials of Guanzhong to bar his departure. Reluctantly, he assumed the abbacy. After only half a year, he took leave to visit various regions, then returned to Zhen Prefecture.

Before long, he attended the funeral of Perfected Yuanming, Li Zhiyuan, in Youxin. On his return journey, stopping in Daming, one morning after completing his ablutions, he suddenly addressed his disciples: "From this day forward, I shall no longer transmit the teachings to others." As the sun reached its zenith, he passed away in stillness.

He had once remarked to others: "Many of the masters above us lingered with illness for too long, unable to depart swiftly—how deeply it fails to meet one’s wishes."

Someone once asked, "Master, are you capable of this?"
The Master replied, "I shall let you see for yourself."
And so it came to pass. It was the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month in the year *jiyou* (1249), and he was seventy-two years of age. His disciples, led by Wang Yuzhong, escorted his coffin back to Dongping, where they selected the twenty-fifth day of the second month of the following year for his burial in the Hall of Cultivation (*Xiuran Tang*) at the Upper Clarity Longevity Palace.

Master Zichen had once shown favor to me, and I earnestly entreated him for an inscription. The Master was a man of open and upright character, devoted to righteousness and tireless in aiding others, yet his hatred of evil was so intense it seemed he harbored worldly ambitions. In moments of leisure, his conversation and laughter were endearing, but if anything displeased him, he would confront it head-on, arguing fiercely, conceding not even the slightest fault. Yet his heart held no grudges, so though his words were sharp and direct, none took them as malicious. In his dealings with others, he was utterly sincere, ever ready to relieve hardship and distress, treating wealth as lightly as dirt. He delighted in the company of scholar-officials, and after Bianliang fell, many of the northern-passing gentry sought refuge with him. He was especially profound in the study of the mysterious, yet never spoke of supernatural or bewildering arts. Those who received his precepts and were counted among his disciples were beyond numbering. Scholars from all quarters seeking instruction often begged for his poems or calligraphy. He would spread out paper and, with brush in hand, produce hundreds of sheets in a single sitting, never pausing to deliberate, yet the words and characters were always striking. Those who obtained even a fragment or a single character treasured it like a rare jewel. Wherever he traveled, couriers and escorts thronged the roads, banners and canopies choked the way, and horses could scarcely advance. From prefects and magistrates downward, all hastened to pay him homage, bowing as disciples to a master—such was the esteem in which his age held him.

**Inscription:**
The Three Mountains leave no trace, the clouded sea grows dim,
Yet upon the boundless waves lingers the immortal’s spring.
A rare man arose, vast in the wondrous gate,
Ancient lineage’s heir, Chongyang’s true grandson.
With pure discourse, he scattered jade-dust like a spray,
With playful brush, he turned paper into silver waves.
He probed the mysteries of the sages to their roots,
While others could not even glimpse their outer fence.
Softly blooms the mugwort, lush the reeds grow thick—
How many burrow for warmth, content in their crumbling walls?
The roc’s transformation knows not the whirling North Sea,
Yet its wings sweep the eight directions, ever soaring alone.
Retiring to quietude, his Dao grew ever more revered,
Wherever he went, seekers swarmed like bees.
A century’s span, and he returned to the primordial,
His feathered chariot heard again in the heavens’ heights.
Within the radiant, the indestructible abides—
Hui Zi is gone; with whom now shall I discourse?
For the Master, I inscribe this poem for the Nine Springs,
And therein give voice to my own wild words.

**Stele Inscription for the Daoist Virtues of Perfected Wang, Master of the Clouds’ Abode**
Composed by Wang Ying, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History

In the second year of the present emperor’s reign, ancient institutions were restored, and all affairs of state were set in order. Within, the imperial offices were strictly regulated; without, surveillance commissioners were appointed. Rewards were bestowed to honor merit, and noble titles were conferred to exalt the virtuous. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Chief Minister of the Secretariat memorialized: "The Elder Patriarch of the Quanzhen School, Wang Qiyun, is of pure conduct and upright character, revered throughout the realm. It is fitting that an imperial rescript be issued to manifest the court’s favor and esteem." The decree was approved, and he was specially granted the title *Perfected of Kindness, Compassion, Beneficence, and Utmost Virtue*.

When the edict was proclaimed, those within the four seas and across the ten thousand *li* heard it with joy, knowing the honor bestowed was fitting, for the Master was truly worthy of such recognition. The Master’s religious name was *Zhijin*, and he hailed from Wenli in Dongming. His family had long been farmers, prosperous and fond of propriety. From birth, the Master’s body was extraordinary, and he was early drawn to the Dao. At twenty, just as he was to be married, he left without a word and headed straight for the eastern mountains. On the road, he heard that Perfected Taigu of Guangning was expounding the teachings in Ninghai, so he took the disciple’s bow and remained with him for a long time. As his cultivation deepened, he gradually drew closer, receiving oral transmissions and heart-to-heart instructions. Every word he heard was engraved in his heart, and from that time on, his progress in practice grew daily, until at last he received the great seal of approval.

After Perfected Guangning shed his mortal form, the Master came west alone, his sleeves tattered, his gourd bowl broken, his hair unkempt, his face unwashed. He wandered without knowing where he was going, stopped without knowing what he was doing. If people mocked him, he went on; if they insulted him, he bowed and accepted it. Concealing his light and obscuring his tracks, none recognized him as a man of the Dao. Soon, war and famine struck, and bandits swarmed like bees. The people hid in fear, but the Master was seized and bound, about to be killed and cooked. Yet his countenance remained unchanged, his words bold and unyielding, without the slightest trace of fear. The bandits, sensing he was no ordinary man, released him.

Once the chaos subsided, he followed Perfected Changchun north to Yan and Ji, roaming the rocky crags of Panshan’s western ravine. Clad in grass, fed on bark, he seemed prepared to spend his life there. Yet scholars from all directions came daily to seek his counsel, and so his reputation as a master of the Dao grew, his fame spreading far and wide. Still, he remained humble, content to stay behind others. After Perfected Changchun departed this world, he began to travel, though he disliked carrying a begging bowl or staff. In the scorching heat, he wore no hat or fan; in the bitter cold, no fur or cap. Beyond the clothes on his back, he owned nothing. If someone offered him goods or money, he would reluctantly accept, but once it passed before his eyes, he paid it no further mind.

Later, as he journeyed through various regions, wherever he went, he found resonance. Wherever he stayed, he inspired the construction of temples, and these places flourished. Yet he remained utterly at ease, indifferent to whether a place was old or new. Though he might dwell somewhere for a long time, when he left, he never looked back. Even a brief rest, morning or evening, felt as comfortable as a long sojourn. Wherever his carriage tracks led, those who wished to become his disciples numbered in the thousands. High officials and eminent families, white-haired elders and yellow-haired children, recluses in black and gray, and even women of the inner chambers—all prostrated themselves before him. Such was the reverence the world held for him.

When servants or children bowed to him, he would return the gesture. If asked why, he would say: "All who belong to the gate of the mysterious are disciples of the Most High, and thus my brothers and sisters. The greatest affliction in the world is arrogance and disdain. The nature of the Dao is inherent in everyone—why distinguish between elder and younger?" Those who heard this were filled with admiration.

Amidst daily life, he lived in serene simplicity, eschewing ostentation, yet when offering sacrifices to the lofty Perfected Ones, he adorned every detail with solemn reverence, never deeming it excessive. Though crowned in gold and jade, robed in crane-feathered gowns, and shod in phoenix-embroidered shoes, he wore them without hesitation. During the rites he conducted, auspicious omens repeatedly manifested—sometimes phoenixes and cranes soared in the sky, or wind and rain arrived as if by appointment—yet he remained reticent, leaving no record of such wonders.

In the year *wuzǐ*, as he passed through Zhenshi, General Cao Delu invited him to preside over a grand Yellow Register Retreat. Thousands gathered from near and far, but the local well could scarcely supply water for thirty people. Distressed, Cao sought the Master’s aid. The Master ordered tea and fruit prepared, then personally offered them in ritual at the well, covering it with a clean mat. After a full day and night, the seal was lifted to reveal a surging spring that never ran dry, returning to its original state only after the rites concluded. Though the tale spread far and wide, the Master regarded it as unremarkable. When asked for an explanation, he replied: “There is no mystery—he petitioned with sincerity, and I responded in kind. When sincerity meets sincerity, even heaven and earth commune; how much more so in lesser matters?” Those who heard this marveled all the more, though his wondrous responses defy full recounting.

Earlier, when True Man Chongyang ascended to the West, his four disciples—Qidan, Yang, and the others—transmitted the Dao in a lodging house in Bian. The host, surnamed Wang, treated them with disrespect and slander. Chongyang declared: “The land where I dwell shall one day see your descendants build their homes here.” The host dismissed him as mad. Yet soon after Chongyang attained immortality, and sixty-four years later, when Bian fell, the Master led his disciples to that very site. Within a decade, its halls and pavilions stood resplendent, their grandeur eclipsing all others. Those who recognized the truth knew Chongyang’s words had come to pass, though the Master never claimed credit, insisting it was the work of others. In all his undertakings, he allowed participation by free will, never compelling or pressuring anyone, so that people gladly contributed.

In the summer of the *guǐhài* year of the Zhongtong era, on the first day of the sixth month (*jǐyǒu*), he sat tranquilly in the Square Gourd Chamber, silent and fasting. His disciples, perplexed, inquired after him, but he merely closed his eyes, composed his spirit, and pointed to the empty air. Later, he bathed and retired to bed. No sound of breathing was heard, no movement of limbs seen. His disciples kept vigil around him, not daring to leave. He rebuked them: “Go attend to your own proper tasks.” Seventeen days later, on the *yǐchǒu* day, he reclined with his head on his arm and passed away peacefully at the age of eighty-six. The entire city wept for three days, and from near and far, those who received word of his death set up altars to mourn him, honoring him as if he were still alive. Such was the depth of his sincerity in moving others.

Though he never studied books, his actions accorded with reason, and his words were nothing but truth. His conduct aligned with the *Two Chapters* and *Four Supplements*, and whenever he saw the slightest opportunity to benefit people or things, he acted without hesitation. Once, in a bare chamber with walls on all sides, he seemed to address a thousand or ten thousand, yet there was no pretense, no indulgence, no irreverence. Day after day, year after year, he remained thus—what is called “standing alone without change, circulating endlessly without exhaustion.” Only the Master embodied this.

Gentle in benefiting others, frugal in disciplining himself, and humble in nurturing his spirit, he preserved the three treasures of Laozi. Thus, he ascended to harmonize with the will of heaven and descended to earn the trust of the people, standing steadfast as the preeminent master of his age. Scholars followed in his wake, yet found themselves unable to match him.

In the first month of the *kùndūn* year, the Master’s disciples Lun Zhiyuan and Wei Zhiyan, bearing his *Record of Conduct*, along with Supervisors Zhang Zhige and Li Zhiju, traveled thousands of miles to request an inscription from me. The Master and I shared the same hometown and clan. Years ago, when I served under censure in the Hanlin Academy, I had long known his name, but the divide between north and south kept us apart. Only after crossing north did I first meet him in Yan. Unsure of our exact kinship, I bowed to him as one elder by a generation, and he returned the gesture. In later years, we met often, and he frequently honored me with his presence, conversing through the day.

Once, I ventured to ask: “Master, at eighty, you should dwell in seclusion, transmitting the Dao to those who seek it, allowing them to come to you with incense and offerings. Would that not be more dignified? Yet you tirelessly accept every invitation, your carriage never at rest, your steps never still. Is this not bordering on frivolity?” The Master replied: “You are but a scholar. In all dealings, one must observe distinctions. We of the Quanzhen tradition dare not forsake the path left by our predecessors. Whether summoned by the rich or the poor, whether called ten times a day or from a thousand miles away, we go—eager to benefit others, unwilling to rest even briefly for our own convenience.”

I asked further: “Wherever you go, you bestow talismans and register names by the day, numbering beyond count. You inquire nothing of their character or background. Among them, might there not be wicked youths who take disciples? Could this not become a burden?” The Master said: “This is precisely the work of Quanzhen’s transformation. If a man who was a thief in the morning becomes a Boyi by evening, what more could we ask? Even if only one in a thousand or ten thousand is thus transformed, it is the power of our guidance.” Hearing this, I rejoiced greatly, knowing the Master’s heart was the heart of heaven and earth, the heart of parents.

For later scholars seeking the Master’s truth and wholeness, a single volume of his recorded sayings will more than suffice. Though I am a feeble old man, unworthy of my position in the Hanlin Academy, and should not compose texts beyond imperial commissions, the Master’s bond as a fellow townsman and clansman, along with the entreaties of the Venerable Master of Teaching and Illumination, left me no choice but to comply. Thus, I set down these essentials, bowing my head in reverence to compose this inscription.

**Inscription:**
The supreme virtue of the Mysterious Origin flows in serene non-action,
Its streams diverging, surging in all directions.
Heaven bestowed the Quanzhen,
To dam and bind its currents.
Seven founders arose,
To become teachers for a hundred generations.
Among them was Guangning,
Known as the Iron-Faced One.
Dwelling in clouds, entering the court,
Long tempered in the forge of practice.

Alone he journeyed west, without a single companion to envy his strength,
Amid flashing blades, his spirit and countenance remained unaltered.
Northward he traveled to Yan and Ji, nurturing his vastness on Mount Pan,
Disciples flocked to him, daily knocking at the gate of mystery.
Though he answered their words, his heart remained at ease,
Like the immortal Changchun in serene repose, sporting among men.

Once in Bianliang, where Chongyang shed his mortal form,
He grandly established the Chaoyuan Abbey, its eaves soaring like pheasant wings.
Yet he claimed no merit for himself, attributing all to the collective effort.
His fame ascended to the ninefold heavens, and an imperial decree lauded his virtue.
At eighty-six, he casually responded to the call,
Secretly bearing the Dao’s allure, his followers numbering in the hundreds and thousands.
At the tidings of his passing, tears streamed down like rain,
Yet he entrusted his teachings as ever, ensuring their transmission.

Only the Master’s conduct shone bright in the annals of the Dao,
Only the Master’s name resounded across ten thousand *li*.
This stately stele cannot encompass all his glory,
Yet my inscription bears no shame.

**Stele Commemorating the Virtuous Conduct of Master Zhang Yinglü, Who Upheld the Teachings and Honored the Dao**
*Composed by Meng Qi, Gentleman for Attendance, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and Hanlin Academician for the Presentation of Texts*

Vast indeed is the Dao in its function—
Encompassing the boundless, penetrating the infinitesimal.
Eighteen hundred years after the traces of the Mysterious Origin,
Those who donned yellow caps and crane-feathered robes,
Taking the Five Thousand Words as their宗,
Were too numerous to record.
Yet the Quanzhen teachings alone could greatly revive the mystic wind,
Converging all currents into one.
Examining their conduct, how could this arise without foundation?

Amid the tumult of heaven and earth’s upheaval,
The Old Immortal Changchun was summoned from the seashore,
First entreating the throne to cherish life and abhor killing.
A single word’s merit sufficed to move the ninefold heavens and sway the four seas.
Moreover, the eighteen attendants who accompanied him—
All were heroic, magnanimous, and consummate in Dao and conduct.
Some served as his heart and spine, others as his wings,
Making it impossible for the mystic wind not to flourish,
Or the myriad streams not to unite.

Thus, the Great Master Yinglü, who upheld the teachings and honored the Dao,
Was one of these eighteen.
The Master’s surname was Zhang, his given name Zhisu, and his sobriquet Gushenzi.
A native of Suiyang, at his conception his mother dreamed of a robed elder presenting her with a lingzhi mushroom,
And the next day, the Master was born.
As he grew, his bearing was elegant and refined.
Meeting an extraordinary man who offered him wine,
His spirit suddenly awakened, and he harbored thoughts of transcending the dusty world.
Thereupon, he gathered like-minded companions to pay homage to the Perfected Changchun in Laizhou.
Changchun gnashed his teeth and railed, paying no heed,
And the others, greatly alarmed, withdrew in succession.
Only the Master remained, humbly seeking instruction.
Changchun burst into laughter: "This lad is teachable."
And so, he was assigned to the kitchen.

From accompanying Changchun on his journey to the Eastern Sea,
To answering the summons of the Dragon Court,
To encircling the tracks of the Western Regions,
To resting his carriage in Yanjing—
Through perilous passes spanning tens of thousands of *li*,
Over forty years from beginning to end,
He attended and served Changchun without ever failing his intent,
Even briefly parting from his staff and cane,
As if losing a hand.

After Changchun’s ascension,
The Perfected Qinghe and Zhenchang succeeded to the teachings.
The Master once held the position of *tidian*,
And later recorded Daoist affairs in the Central Capital.
Official duties piled up like fish scales,
Others would have found them overwhelming,
But he handled them with effortless ease.

Thereafter, he accepted the invitation of northern lords,
Expounding the teachings at Bailiu,
Where his disciples and halls gleamed,
Transforming the very face of the region.
At that time, the ancestral court of the Mysterious Origin in Qiaojun,
Long ruined by war,
Was deemed too difficult to restore.
The Perfected Chengming, however, believed only the Master could accomplish it.
A letter and gifts were sent,
And he turned his carriage from Bailiu southward.
After more than a decade,
Over a hundred bays of halls and corridors were rebuilt,
Their colors and hues renewed.
The prefecture reported his achievements,
And an imperial edict specially granted him guards of honor,
Along with his present title of *Zongshi*.

In the fifth year of the Zhiyuan era, the twelfth month,
Light repeatedly emanated from his crown,
Its misty radiance suffusing the heavens.
One day, he told his disciples:
"The Perfected Changchun has summoned me to the Pavilion of Wind."
Thereupon, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, and passed away,
At the age of eighty-one.

Alas, how extraordinary!

The Master possessed talent, strategy, and administrative skill, accomplishing whatever he undertook. In literature and technical arts, there was nothing he did not excel in—so much so that when news of his passing spread, all mourned as though the groves of the Dao had withered.

Yet how could this alone suffice to know the Master? The great adepts of the Dao regard the heart as dead ashes, the body as withered wood; they cast aside cleverness, abandon desire, and attain such stillness that, leaning upon their armrests, they forget even themselves. The Master was such a perfected one—how could he be otherwise?

Yet his true radiance shone inwardly, his heart roaming with heaven. When things arose before him, at times he met them with profound silence, at times with flowing responsiveness. What manifested outwardly could not but become the work of a sage—yet when the common folk chattered of his wondrous, unfathomable subtleties, they could not grasp their meaning, and so praised him merely as a man of simple virtue.

He who would observe the Master of Valley Spirit must seek him through these words, and perhaps then he will not err.

One day, Li Zhibi, the *zhuchi* of the Supreme Clarity Palace, recorded the Master’s life at the behest of Daoist *tidian* Liu. Though duty forbade refusal, I have here distilled his account and set it down. Respectfully recorded in the spring of the ninth year of the Zhiyuan era.

**Epitaph for the Daoist Conduct of the Perfected Master of Orthodox Teaching, Chengming**
*Composed by Wang Pan, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Consultation, Drafter of Edicts, and Co-Compiler of the National History*

The Master’s surname was Zhang, his given name Zhijing, and his courtesy name Yiqing. He was a native of Anci in Yanjing.

From childhood, he was pure and lively, his bones rugged as cliffs. He spoke little, rarely laughed, and disliked meat. At the sight of Daoists, he would joyfully greet them; when he heard the recitation of Daoist scriptures, he would listen intently, unwilling to depart.

His parents said to one another: *"Could this child have a predestined affinity with the realm beyond?"*

At the age of eight, he was sent to Changchun Abbey, where he paid homage to Perfected Master Zhenchang Li as his teacher. He served at his side day and night, never leaving.

Zhenchang had originally been a scholar, fond of literature, and the Master was quick-witted, diligent in recitation, and skilled in calligraphy. Moreover, he was as disciplined as an adult, so Zhenchang cherished him especially.

Master Shuzhai Wang, renowned in his time for poetry and aloof from worldly concerns, dwelled in the Daoist abbey. Zhenchang instructed the Master to study under him.

West of the abbot’s quarters stood the Hall of Assembling Mystery, beside which was a small tower holding ten thousand scrolls—none could reach it. Zhenchang entrusted the Master with its keys, allowing him free rein to explore.

With exceptional innate endowments and the means to nurture and perfect them already in place, it was no wonder his attainments surpassed the ordinary.

In the year *jiayin*, he was appointed *tidian* of the Daoist teachings.

Two years later, Zhenchang manifested transformation. As his final moments neared, his disciples asked about the succession. Zhenchang said: *"Zhijing is here—what need you fear?"*

After the mourning rites, the assembly bowed to the Master, and all within and without submitted in reverence.

In the third year of the Zhongtong era, the imperial court bestowed upon him an edict, which read:

*"Perfected Master of Orthodox Teaching Zhang Zhijing, from childhood clad in Daoist robes, cultivated pure conduct and extensive learning. In his early thirties, he accomplished rare deeds, illuminating his predecessors and setting an example for posterity. He is hereby granted the honorific title Perfected Master Guangxian Tidao Chengming."*

Having received this new grace, he deepened his steadfast observance.

In the second year of the Zhiyuan era, by imperial decree, a grand Golden Register Offering of thirty-six hundred altars was held at Changchun Abbey. On the day of the ritual, a flock of cranes soared and danced, descending to circle the altar. For days, they came and went. The Son of Heaven praised this, bestowing upon the Master a golden crown and a cloud-patterned ritual robe, and commanded a Hanlin scholar to compose a *Record of Auspicious Signs*, to be engraved on stone.

The temples of the Five Sacred Peaks and the Four Waterways had suffered in the wars of the Jin decline, most lying in ruins. The imperial treasury issued one hundred thousand strings of paper money to the Master for repairs. He selected honest and capable Daoists, allocating funds according to the scale of each task, entrusting them with the work.

Some cleared rubble to rebuild; others patched leaks and expanded structures. After two years, the Five Peaks and the Four Waterways, along with their five temples, were restored to their former glory.

Just as he was about to inscribe the achievements on stone to honor the sacred rites of the dynasty, reverence for mountains and rivers, and the grandeur of restoration, the Master suddenly fell mildly ill. On the seventeenth day of the eleventh month in the winter of the seventh year of the Zhiyuan era, he passed away at the age of fifty-one.

Scholars and officials of the capital, along with Daoists and laypeople from afar, thronged the streets with incense and offerings, their mourning lasting for months.

Alas! The Quanzhen teachings take recognizing the mind and seeing the nature as their essence, and diminishing the self to benefit others as their practice. They do not rely on doctrinal study or written texts. From Wang Zhenren of Chongyang to Li Zhenchang, after three transmissions, disciples gradually began to read scriptures, no longer seeing texts as obstacles.

When the Master assumed leadership, he greatly expanded the profound principles of the Dao. Thereafter, disciples all understood that discussing scriptures and immersing themselves in their meanings was the true gateway to entry.

At the beginning of his succession, many of his predecessors in the lineage remained. Though the Master was of a later generation, he surpassed them, and some harbored slight resentment. Yet his virtue was deep and his demeanor gentle; he dwelled in harmony, free from the dust of the world. The fierce were subdued by his humility, the arrogant shamed by his modesty. Though initially met with some resistance, over time, all came to admire him.

Moreover, he was meticulous in self-cultivation and adaptable in dealing with others. The worthy scholars and officials of the capital, along with visitors from all directions, all found their hearts at ease in his presence.

On the third day of the third month in the ninth year of the Zhiyuan era, he was buried east of the Wuhua Mountain Daoist Abbey.

After the funeral rites, *Tidian* Liu Zhidun presented the Master’s *Record of Conduct* and, on the command of the succeeding Perfected Master Wang Zhitan, requested this inscription. I have here set forth the broad outlines of his life and composed this epitaph:

**Epitaph**

Heaven endows all with innate goodness,
And in birth, all are whole and complete.
Yet seduced by things, they drift with change,
And the Great Simplicity begins to wane and fragment.

Then a Perfected One arose in Qin,
Neither striving nor acting, forgetting words.
His influence reached even the weak of the Eastern Sea,
Guiding scholars back to the wellspring of purity.

After four transmissions, the Dao grew ever more refined,
And in succession, the Perfected Chengming appeared.
Chengming early harbored the aspiration of azure clouds,
His exceptional roots and endowments planted in past lives.

With his topknot still bound, he entered Changchun Abbey,
Where three thousand Daoists looked up to his bearing.
Deep in the Hall of Assembling Mystery, none trod,
Its thousand scrolls locked in silent secrecy.

The Master held the keys and browsed at will,
Ten thousand scrolls surged like an ocean in his breast.
Swiftly he traversed the path through waves of toil,
In breadth finding depth—there lay the true Dao.

The True Constancy school’s disciples spread across the land,
And though many were venerable and ripe in years,
One day he followed transformation, brushed his robes, and departed,
His mind-to-mind transmission secretly bestowed upon his closest disciple.

Like the high altar built to honor Han Xin,
This ancient grand affair astonished the three armies.
The Dao is always realized through the heart’s awakening,
Rank and seniority do not depend on age or time.

Over a hundred thousand in feathered robes and yellow caps
Hastened along the roads beneath Changchun Abbey.
To immortals, the world’s passing is like drifting duckweed,
And empty space gathers and scatters floating clouds with ease.

At times he would enter the marketplace to observe the changes of things,
Then suddenly ride a simurgh or crane to ascend the azure heavens.
West and north of Jade Spring, mist and rosy clouds abound,
And the Five-Flowered Mountain’s peaks rise lofty and majestic.

With a swift chariot he departed, one with the flowing waves,
Leaving his immortal bones buried in the mountain’s embrace.
Through a thousand autumns of wind and rain, tangled vines and clouds,
The grand stele before his tomb bears no false word.

**Stele Inscription for Master Zhanran, Venerable Zhao**
*Composed by Meng Panlin, former Metropolitan Graduate and Educational Supervisor of the Jingzhao Circuit*

The Daoists of old held upright their hearts,
Strengthened and magnified their qi,
Unswayed by worldly affairs,
Unmixed with human desires.
Profit and harm, sorrow and joy could not delude them,
Gain and loss, favor and disgrace could not move them.
In their conduct, they manifested transcendent goodness,
In their words, revealed surpassing beauty.
Within the Confucian forest, they set the model for Confucian arts,
In the Mystery Gate, they established the standard for Daoist learning.
Without a heart of uprightness, qi of strength and greatness,
And cultivation perfected to the utmost, enduring to the end,
Who could achieve such a state?

Master Zhanran, Venerable Zhao,
Whose personal name was Jiuyuan and courtesy name Jidao,
Was a native of Longzhou.
From youth, he left the household life and paid homage to Grand Master Danyang.
Endowed with a lofty and luminous nature,
His virtue was pure and gentle.
The principles of purity, stillness, subtlety, and profundity he had long deeply explored,
While bizarre, empty, and insubstantial matters he never pursued.
Knowing the spirit as the master of the body, he devoted himself to cultivation,
And understanding the Dao’s function through texts, he expressed it in writings.
His speech was never frivolous—what he spoke was always grounded in impartial judgment,
His associations were never indiscriminate—those he befriended were always upright companions.
In every poem, chant, gift, or reply,
He revealed the Mystery’s essence and gave voice to hidden sentiments,
Merging the primordial with the rivers and seas, blending all into one realm.
Thus, his Daoist prestige was revered,
And the influence of his teachings spread widely throughout the western lands.

In the dinghai year, he suddenly departed as an immortal,
And all his disciples long cherished his heart-teachings.
His Dharma heir, Venerable Zhao Zhizhong,
Moved by the debt of his master’s transmission,
Generously donated his personal funds to secure an auspicious site,
Erecting a tomb and stele, and had this inscription carved:

*In the year of abundant mystery and flourishing virtue,
In the month of the Gripping Star’s alignment,
On the day of the Radiant Yang’s great abyss, this inscription was respectfully composed.*

**Tomb Inscription for Master Chongxu of Lingxu Abbey, Zhongnan Mountain**
*Composed by Zhao Jiuyuan, Master Zhanran of Longshan*

The Daoist tradition
Perfects true practice to illuminate its forebears,
Cultivates substantive virtue to instruct future generations,
Soars high above worldly concerns,
Transcending the dusty realm—
Such are the extraordinary and peerless deeds of the noble.
How magnificent!

The Quanzhen Daoist teaching arose thus:
Founder Chongyang opened its source,
Followed by the Seven Perfected who expanded its flow.
Who then took up their mantle and established the ancestral sanctuary?
Master Chongxu of Lingxu Abbey was foremost among them.

The Master’s Dharma name was Dao’an,
And his family hailed from Ninghai, a prominent lineage.
From childhood, he was keenly perceptive,
His aspirations drawn to the Mystery Gate.
His immortal bearing and Daoist bones were heaven-endowed,
His true practice and substantive virtue innate.
He nobly carried forward Danyang’s aspirations,
Far departing from the paths of the mundane world.

Was he not the hero among those who left the household life?
In serving his master, he was diligent day and night,
In setting his resolve, he remained unwavering to the end.
Thus, for over forty years at the ancestral sanctuary,
He upheld the Mystery Teaching,
Illuminating the former ways.
He built halls and pavilions, purified altars and grounds,
To solemnize the offerings of incense.
He traversed the Dipper and Ox constellations,
Nurtured his spirit and essence,
To perfect the work of stillness and concentration.
Cultivating outwardly while nourishing inwardly,
Accumulating virtue and piling up meritorious deeds,
His instructions for future generations were vast indeed.

During the chaos of the Cheng’an era, the true Dao was obstructed.
Was he not the gourd afloat in the current’s midst?
Unbowed in will, unbent in body,
He turned the reversed waves and propped up the collapsing pillar.
When Perfected Yuyang was entrusted with the teaching by the Kalpa Lord,
The Master rebuilt the foundation.
Thereupon, the abbey was bestowed the name *Lingxu*,
And the Master was granted the title *Chongxu*.
With over three hundred disciples donning the cap and robe,
The teachings of the ancestral sanctuary flourished anew.

In the xinding year, his allotted time in the mortal realm ended.
One day, he gathered his disciples to impart final instructions on the Dao,
And wrote this verse:

*All my life, I never understood Daoist poetry,
For forty years, the bell and chime were my companions.
I barely grasped the three hundred words of the Yin Fu Jing,
And roughly comprehended the five thousand words of the Dao De Jing.
Letting go of each thing, awakening to each thing,
Forgetting all things, relinquishing all things.
This departure will not be summoned by Yama,
Today, I await only the Jade Emperor’s decree.*

After reciting the verse, he serenely transformed into an immortal,
Having lived eighty springs.
Alas! Those who leave the household life to cultivate the Dao,
Like Master Lü, are truly among the extraordinary and peerless.

Thereafter, his Dharma brother Bi Zhichang
Interred the Master’s remains north of the ancestral burial grounds,
And entreated me to compose this inscription to honor his hidden virtues.
Thus, I have gathered the facts and recorded them,
And appended this eulogy:

*Of Master Lü, we recall,
His noble lineage, his outstanding endowments.
Young, he escaped the world’s net,
Early, he entered the Daoist abbey.
In serving his master, he was ever respectful,
In interacting with others, ever reverent.
In resolve and deeds, he began and endured to the end.
Unashamed of his ancestors, he cultivated himself with integrity.
Amidst the decline of the Dao, he revived its teachings,
Inaugurating blessings for future generations,
Expanding the work of true practice.
Bestowed with an honorific title,
All admired his virtue and bearing.*

The great reckoning having come, the dusty bonds of the world suddenly dissolved. His boat drifted into the night-dark ravine, and his treasures were preserved within the village. Now they are inscribed upon enduring stone, that his glory may blaze without end.

**Biography of Master Cui Zhenjing**
*Composed by Du Renjie of Zhixuan*

The Master’s surname was Cui, his given name Daoyan, his courtesy name Xuanfu. A native of Guan’s Xiuren, he was styled Zhenjing. By nature refined and free of vulgar airs, he studied the books of the Three Teachings in his youth, penetrating their great meanings. Those who knew him regarded him as a vessel for the Dao.

He served his parents with pure filial devotion, dwelling in a hut by their graves for three years. Later, he left home to become a Daoist, studying under Liu Changsheng of the Eastern Sea and receiving the full transmission of his teachings. Returning to reside at Weijia Villa in Jiangling, he practiced medicine to lay what he called "the foundation of accumulated goodness." From the wealthy, he took nothing; to the poor and destitute, he gave generously. Thus, no untimely deaths occurred in the surrounding lands, and all revered his virtue.

A crude physician named Wang Zhang grew deeply envious and resolved to bring about the Master’s death. One day, encountering him in an open field, Wang seized and tore at him, throwing him to the ground. He stuffed his mouth with clods of earth and left. Believing the Master dead, Wang departed, but after a short while, the Master revived. When passersby cried out in alarm and asked what had happened, he replied, "Whenever my illness flares, it is always like this." Thereafter, he paid it no further mind.

Before long, his disciple Liu Zhida entreated him to reside at Haotian Abbey on Mount Bujin. Two locals, Yang Juan and Bi Lin, sought to test him and promised to come in mid-winter. When they failed to appear, a great snow fell. Bi, sweeping his courtyard, found a scrap of paper. Unfolding it, he saw it was a letter from the Master reproaching the two for breaking their cold-weather pact. There were also disciples from Mount Heng—Ma Zhiding and Lu Zhiheng—who had studied under the Master for some time. Before departing, they left a poem as a parting gift, which they affixed to the wall of his hall. When the hall later burned, the poem remained untouched on the wall, appearing as freshly inked as the day it was written. Such were the wonders that attended him.

During the chaos of the Zhenyou era, he boldly crossed the river southward and took up residence at Chunyang Abbey in Gong. Before long, disciples filled the courtyard. On the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month in the Xinsi year of the Xingding era, he sat upright facing south and passed away, having lived eighty-one years by common reckoning.

All that the Master accomplished in his life—his deeds, his attainments—were fully embodied in his disciple Zhang Zhiwei.

**Eulogy:**
What the world values in those who attain the Dao is simply this: they come when the time is right, and they depart when their course is done. It is not merely riding clouds and mist, straddling the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, parting water and fire, or discarding one’s cap for the crows. Nor is it the procession of embroidered banners or the accompaniment of music that serves as proof of ascension to heaven. I have read the *Biographies of the Immortals*, and such tales abound. Yet among the recluses of old who peacefully shed their forms in the depths of mountains and valleys, how many thousands or tens of thousands have passed unknown, their names lost to time? Only those fortunate enough to be recorded by men of later ages survive, though their stories are often exaggerated, making it difficult for posterity to fully believe them. How regrettable!

Yet when I reflect on the hearts of those recluses, I suspect they were not so eager to astonish the world with their deeds. The Master was different. Neither wholly within nor without, neither being nor non-being—was he a follower of the Yellow? His teachings and precepts were stricter than those of the Buddhists. Was he a follower of the Black? His conduct in loyalty and filial piety surpassed that of the early Confucians. He blended the myriad methods of the ancient sages into one, leaving no division. When Ma and Lu departed, he sent them off with a poem likening their teachings to a prairie fire. To Yang and Bi, he presented a letter in the snow of his courtyard. Such playful mastery of the three mysteries—was this truly the Master’s deepest intent?

In essence, he took compassion, frugality, propriety, and deference as the foundation of his character, and the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Analects*, and the *Mencius* as the tokens of his instruction. When he passed, he sat motionless as if at ease in his chambers, his spirit vast and roaming with the Creator, his breath merging with the primordial qi. Thus, when the imperial grace was bestowed, his name was inscribed in the Pure Capital, and he was honored as Zhenjing—True Stillness. Was this not fitting?

**Stele Inscription for Master Chonghe the True Man**
*Composed by Pan Gonglü, Hanlin Academician, Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent, Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, and Compiler of the National History*

Since the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from Guangcheng, the teachings of immortals and transcendents have flourished. Master Lao traversed the Yin and Zhou dynasties, distilling the essential mysteries into the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Its Virtue*, and his teachings endured for ten thousand generations. By the Qin and Han dynasties, those who cultivated merit and ability, harmonized branches and roots, and aligned their practices with the Buddhist disciples saw their halls rise swiftly, and within a few years, a new abbey was completed.

The halls, pavilions, corridors, oratories, kitchens, stables, and storehouses—even the lodgings, bathhouses, and ancillary structures—each had its place, all gleaming and renewed. To the north of the abbey stood a mountain called Nine Peaks, where locals said Master Chunyang had attained the Dao. His disciple Liu Ruoshui built the Upper Abbey of Chunyang, and beside it, more than ten subsidiary cloisters. They purchased fertile fields, bamboo groves, vegetable gardens, orchards, boats, carts, mills, and grinding stones, the annual yields of which supplied all the abbey’s needs.

When visitors from the four directions came to pay their respects, they looked around in awe. The solemnity and grandeur inspired reverence in all who beheld it. Though the transformation from humble shrine to grand abbey was beyond measure, what did it add to or detract from Chunyang’s true essence? Yet through such adornment, the Way spreads ever farther, and people’s responses vary. This is why the teachings of images cannot be abandoned in later ages.

By elevating the senses of the world through what is seen and heard, one dispels frivolous thoughts. The solemnity of the outer form aids the inner cultivation. The reverence for images is the reverence for the Dao. Thus, the Master’s expansion, renovation, and grand construction were not merely to boast of splendor.

In the autumn of the *jiyou* year, an august decree from the Empress commanded that incense be offered at all sacred mountains, numinous peaks, and the halls of Daoist masters, with imperial attendants dispatched to perform the rites. Thereupon, the Jade Clarity Abbey in Weiyang was expanded and renovated, and at the Maigu Grotto on Kunjian Mountain, the imperial edicts and patents of past dynasties were engraved upon stone to manifest the traces of the divine.

In the summer of the *renzi* year, during the fourth month, Zhenchang, acting on imperial orders to offer sacrifices at the sacred peaks and recite the liturgy, passed through Yongle. Seeing its vast and magnificent scale, he rejoiced and said to the Master, “None but you could have brought this sublime affinity to fruition.” He then emptied the treasury to aid its expenses. The next morning, he ascended the summit of Nine Peaks with the Master. Beholding its towering beauty, like a great chair, they renamed it Jade Chair Peak.

In the spring of the *jiayin* year, while the Sagely Son of Heaven was still in his princely residence, he commanded a grand *jiao* ritual for all under heaven to be held at Changchun Abbey. Thereupon, Daoist adepts of lofty conduct and pure virtue from the four directions were summoned to gather, and the Master was foremost among those selected. Auspicious omens of colored clouds, phoenixes, and cranes appeared. Zhenchang remarked, “This omen rightly befits you,” and presented him with a golden crown and brocade robes left by the Qinghe Perfected.

After the rites concluded, the Master returned to Yongle. In the summer of the *bingchen* year, during the fourth month, he arrived at the Upper Abbey. On the first day of the fifth month, he suddenly addressed his attendants: “In my youth, I met Master Changchun, who transmitted secret teachings to me. I have recited them all my life and gained some small understanding. Later, Qinghe and Zhenchang entrusted me with the ancestral lineage of Master Chunyang. In recent years, my labors have gradually taken shape. Now, the lineage’s Way and my own cultivation have nearly reached completion, and nothing remains to be done. Shall I depart?”

The assembly did not grasp his meaning. On the twenty-sixth day, as he prepared to return to the Lower Abbey, it was the height of summer, and the scorching sun weighed upon the journey. His followers feared he would fall ill, but the Master said, “Go without concern.” Suddenly, dark mists gathered on all sides. When they reached within forty *li* of the Lower Abbey, the heat was no longer felt—a marvel indeed.

Before the Chunyang Hall stood two ancient persimmon trees, their roots and trunks gnarled, their branches and leaves luxuriant. One night, without wind, they snapped of their own accord. The assembly, startled, realized: “For these trees to break without wind is a great portent. Our Master’s words the other day were foreshadowed here.”

That night, as the second watch neared its end, the Master suddenly rose, leaning on his staff, and stepped outside. Facing the four directions, he recited incantations.

Immediately, he scattered ashes upon the ground and sat exposed to the open air for some time, as if awaiting something. Soon after, he returned inside, washed his face with warm water, changed his robes, and called for a brush. He composed a hymn of praise, and upon finishing, lay down upon his pillow and passed away in perfect serenity, having lived sixty-six springs and autumns.

His disciples hastened to inform the Preceptor Chengming Zhenren, who dispatched Administrator Meng with generous funeral offerings. In the *gengshen* year, on the fifth day of the third month, he was interred at the *qian* position of the abbey, where a separate shrine was erected. His successors were charged with maintaining seasonal incense and offerings, fulfilling the Dao of repaying roots and returning to origins.

Later, Chengming memorialized the Master’s virtue to the imperial court, which bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Chonghe Weimiao Zhenren*.

By nature, the Master was benevolent and magnanimous, his precepts pure and his conduct immaculate. Though he lived among the Daoist clergy, he delighted in goodness and generosity. Each year, when the western residents of Zhongtiao’s eastern reaches borrowed grain from the abbey—amounting to thousands of *shi*—and famine struck, leaving the Daoist community unable to sustain itself, the assembly proposed reclaiming the loans. The Master said, “In times of famine and hunger, to take from them is to take from ourselves—how could this be the heart of a humane man?” Those in debt, hearing this, felt deep gratitude. Thereafter, every year on the anniversary of Pure Yang’s birth, they gathered in procession to offer incense and alms in repayment, making it an annual custom.

In the *guichou* year, during a spring drought, Commander Xu Delu and the village elders entreated the Master to pray for rain. He recited the *Lingbao Sutra*, and within ten days, sweet rains fell in abundance, measuring a foot deep.

The Master once resided at the Upper Abbey of Nine Peaks Pure Yang, where he was also known as the Old Man of Nine Peaks. His disciple, the Abbot of Three Abbeys, Master Yuanjing Liu Ruoshui, built a terrace at the site where the Master had recited scriptures, naming it the *Nine Peaks Old Man’s Scripture Recitation Terrace*. He recorded the Master’s deeds and entrusted them to Wen Zhitong, the administrator of the Pure Yang Longevity Abbey. Wen traveled two thousand *li* from Yongle to the capital, where he sought out the abbey’s chronicler, Liu Zhifu, and said, “The Master’s Dao and conduct were thus—yet the stone of his spirit-path remains uninscribed. I humbly request this record.” Though I demurred for lack of ability, after four or five exchanges, his entreaties grew only more earnest. I admired his profound reverence for his teacher and his unwavering trust in me, and so I consented. Here, I recount the Master’s life from beginning to end, arranging it in order, and append this exposition.

The Dao as teaching is ancient. In its smallest form, it begins with the subtleties of refinement and salvation; in its greatest, it reaches the mysteries of nature and destiny—yet all are matters of practice. As for repairing abbeys and relieving the poor, these are but responses to circumstances, stirred by encounters. They are labor without possession, giving without expectation—mere dregs of spiritual transformation, not the Master’s ultimate attainment. To engage with the world’s entanglements, its clamor and chaos, is to be mired in affairs. Yet to wander in spirit through the formless, to merge *qi* with the vast, to observe alone and transcend the dust-bound realm—how could such a one be troubled by the dust of the world?

Thus, since following the Master by the sea and witnessing his constructions across the land, his traces have moved with the world while his Dao has flowed with the spirit. Never has a day passed without his involvement in affairs, yet never has a day passed without his abiding in effortless tranquility. The world sees only the Master’s daily labors, his unceasing efforts in building and repair, and assumes this is all there is. How could they know that the perfected one follows the natural course, needing no deliberate action? Stillness and response are one; the heart, empty and vast, responds like a ripple on water. This is the true mark of his conduct.

The Dao is one, yet those who name it see it differently—indeed, its names are not limited to one. Let us speak of four: the subtle, the wondrous, the profound, and the penetrating.

It is called *subtle* because it is dim and indistinct, formless and beyond representation.
It is called *wondrous* because its transformations are unfathomable, their causes unknown.
It is *profound* because it is deep and unfathomable.
It is *penetrating* because its transformations pervade all.

Though these descriptions capture its contours, the wisdom of the wise and the benevolence of the benevolent, though their perspectives differ, converge in unity—how could there be two origins?

Vast and undivided, whole and without flaw, filling mountains when in mountains, filling rivers when in rivers—this is the completeness of the Dao. Encompassing all within the six directions, embracing all things great and small, though its transformations are boundless, none are apart from true principle—this is the reality of the Dao.

From this arise destiny, nature, the heart, and from these, emotions. Whether source or stream, when drawn out and extended, what is not complete? What is not real? Thus, completeness and reality are one, yet two; two, yet one. Are they not the root of the myriad transformations, the unified body of the primordial origin?

This is how the Eternal Spring transmitted the Dao to the Master, and the Master, in turn, expanded upon it. This is worthy of inscription.

**Inscription:**
The vast and wondrous principle holds the primordial essence,
Before and after Heaven, without decay or completion.
The one truth refines and stores the myriad forms—
Who lacks, who overflows in this boundless plenitude?

The joy of Heaven, serene and nameless,
Yet the seven apertures sprout, emotions arise.
With cunning minds they contend, with schemes they vie,
A hundred falsities flourish, not one truth remains.

For three thousand years, customs have declined like the wind,
Who could restore the great court?
Yet when the nadir passes, fortune turns—
From the south comes a rare man, grieving for living beings.

Awakened by the heart, he perceives truth, dispelling long blindness.
You are whole, you are real—your nature, your emotions.
As if drunk and sobering, as if dim and awakening,
The six dusts gleam clear, the spirit-pearl shines bright.

The Master unlocked the gate, bore the weight of the mysterious,
For ten years, in motion and stillness, unperturbed.
Externally, he labored amidst the clamor; within, he remained ever at peace.
His work complete, he ascended in transcendence—how effortless his flight!

Riding the wind, he roams the Great Purity,
Gazing down upon the eight poles, the dust-dark world.
The Zhongtiao Mountains rise lush and green,
The Yellow River winds, embracing all in its coils.

This inscription preserves the Master’s great virtue.

**Stele Inscription for the Unassuming Daoist of Pure Virtue, Master Xia of the Way and Power**
*Composed by Zimu Yeren, Ji Zhizhen*

The Master’s surname was Xia, his given name Zhicheng, and his sobriquet the Daoist of Austere Poverty. He hailed from Zhangqiu in Jinan. His family, though of farming stock, was renowned in the village for its accumulated goodness, never acting against righteousness. Through generations, none of his ancestors had ever brought litigation to their door, for they upheld the family’s transmitted principles with steadfast integrity.

His father, Zhen, had three sons, of whom the Master was the eldest. From birth, he was serene and composed, his physique tall and imposing, his nature sincere and earnest, sparing in speech and laughter. Even in childhood, he harbored aspirations beyond the mundane. Upon reaching adulthood, he had no desire for marriage, ever preoccupied with the matters of life, death, and destiny. Only after his two younger brothers came of age did he arrange their marriages, instructing them to honor and support their parents. Then, seeking to leave the household, he was initially denied. In the first year of the Taihe era, he firmly declined further entreaties, and his parents, recognizing the unshakable resolve of his will, at last consented.

He journeyed directly to Taixu Abbey in Qixia, where he became a disciple of the Patriarch of the Changchun School. There, he sought the profound principles of the Dao, serving at his master’s side and treasuring every teaching he received, committing them to heart day and night without fail. Though he did not study secular texts, he daily memorized a thousand words on the cultivation of the Dao and virtue. He carried himself as one who knew nothing, yet diligently attended to all duties—embodying what others found difficult to practice.

During the Zhenyou era, as the Four Barbarians stirred chaos, a great bandit seized Haizhou. The Daoist community there was at a loss, until the Patriarch dispatched the Master to their aid. Without hesitation, he departed. Upon arrival, he employed skillful means to guide many to safety. His obedience and integrity were such that, though he passed through the perils of tigers, rhinoceroses, and armed conflict, he harbored no fear—his reverence and faith rendered him single-minded.

In the year Jimao, the imperial court sent envoys to summon the Patriarch, and the Master accompanied him northward to the deserts of Juyan, a journey of tens of thousands of *li*. When his fellow travelers grew weary, he offered his own mount and walked on foot—such was his willingness to endure hardship for the sake of others. Upon reaching the imperial court, he remained but briefly before returning with the Patriarch to Yan. There, he helped establish the gates of the Mystery, and the true wind of the Dao flourished. From near and far, seekers thronged like a marketplace to burn incense and pay their respects.

Whatever treasures, curiosities, or wealth came his way, he never inquired after their origins. If someone asked, he gave freely, without reluctance. The Patriarch, recognizing his selfless disposition, entrusted him with the affairs of Yuxu Abbey. Yet within a few years, he returned to the palace, staff in hand, sleeves swaying—having cast aside all possessions, for he allowed nothing to weigh upon his mind. Later, he was again appointed to oversee Baiyun Abbey. Leading the community with diligence, all deferred to his virtue.

In the autumn of the Dinghai year, the Patriarch passed from this world. His successor, Qinghe, assumed leadership of the Mystery Teachings, and in the Renchen year, the Master was appointed *Tidian* of Changchun Palace. Though he dwelled amidst the throng, he never harbored arrogance. If unaddressed, he would pass the day in silence; if questioned, he would respond with gentle clarity, ever urging others to practice the Dao. Amidst the clamor and chaos, he made no distinctions—whether beggar, servant, or the least of his disciples, even a mad youth sitting across from him, he spoke with the same familiarity as he would with noble kinsmen or high officials. For in his heart, there was no "other."

In the autumn of the Renyin year, he had overseen the palace’s affairs for more than a decade. Aged, he sought retirement, yet the community clung to him, unwilling to let him go. Only after persistent refusal was he released. Though he withdrew to a life of leisure, whenever there was communal labor, he led by example—so utterly had he forgotten the self.

Throughout his time at the Patriarch’s side, his devotion remained constant, as if it were but a single day. His reverence for his master never wavered. Often, he would sit in solemn stillness all day, steadfast as stone. Even amidst clamor and confusion, he seemed deaf and blind, like a wooden figure. Those who did not know him mistook him for a fool. Yet when questioned on the esoteric teachings of the primordial Dao, he elucidated their essentials with clarity—though he himself never spoke of them. Such was the depth of his cultivation, his capacity for tranquility.

In his governance, he was focused; in his conduct, genuine. In his demeanor, he was unassuming; in his dealings with others, magnanimous. In serving his superiors, he was respectful; in engaging with people, sincere. All arose from the purity and uprightness of his virtue.

In the year Wushen, the *Zhangjiao* True Man, by imperial favor, bestowed upon him the title *Wuwei Baodao Sude Qingxu Dashi* ("Unassuming Daoist of Pure Virtue and Emptiness, Great Master of the Way and Power"), along with a golden crown and brocade robes. On the sixth day of the eighth month in the year Yimao, he departed this life at the age of eighty-three. His disciples interred his robes and cap in the Immortal’s Burial Ground of Wuhua—a fitting observance.

In the year Xinyou, the imperial court, admiring his virtue, dispatched envoys to posthumously bestow his present title. I have often reflected upon him: long ago, the teacher of Tian Zifang was Shuguo Shunzi. His character was that of a true man—his appearance natural, his emptiness preserving authenticity, his clarity embracing all things. Those without the Dao would adjust their countenance in his presence, their worldly concerns dissolving. Yet Tian Zifang never praised him, for his virtue was beyond words.

The True Man of Pure Virtue resembled Shuguo in character—how strikingly alike they were! From his youth to the end of his days, he walked the path of the Mystery without a trace of selfish desire. In leading others by example, he never inflicted harm or reproach. His single-minded devotion ensured that inwardly, he never lost himself, and outwardly, he never failed others. Moving through the illusory realm of the dusty world, he remained unobstructed—truly, one whose appearance was natural and whose clarity embraced all things.

As for his conduct, it left no false traces; his words, no shameful speech. Whether gesturing or speaking, he acted with authenticity. In silence or speech, in action or stillness, all was rooted in truth. Yet these are but the outward signs. For over sixty years in the gates of the Mystery, he received secret transmissions from his true master—matters not easily revealed to others. Such are the mysteries of sage wisdom, inscrutable even to ghosts and spirits, destined to endure as long as heaven and earth. How could the common crowd presume to lightly discuss them?

Later generations who hear of Master Yu’s pure, tranquil, true, and serene demeanor strive to emulate it, yet none who let their minds wander ever return. With time, they grow akin to him, drawing near to the Dao. In the *zhongtong* reign, during the cyclical year *guan dun* and the *guxi* month, on the day following the full moon, I fasted, bathed, and bowed my head to compose this record.

**Epitaph for the Tomb Stele of Master Yu, the Great Master of Emptiness**

Composed by Li Ding of Taiyuan

The Master’s surname was Yu, his given name Zhi Ke, his courtesy name Xian Dao, and his sobriquet *Chong Xu* (Emptiness). A native of Ninghai, he was a descendant of the eminent Yu clan of the Han. His father, Jiang, had six sons, of whom the Master was the youngest. Even as a child, he was refined and fond of simplicity, his youthful years marked by a resolve to transcend the mundane world.

At the beginning of the *Cheng’an* era, the Perfected Liu of Longevity began teaching the Dao at the Wu Palace. The Master, upon hearing this, went to him and, in a single glance, seemed to find resonance. Though bound by his father and elder brothers’ restraints, preventing him from immediately following Liu in seclusion, the silent call of destiny had already stirred within him, and he could not resist. At nineteen, he finally resolved to serve at Liu’s side. Shortly after, the Perfected Liu ascended, and the Master sought the Dharma from the Patriarch of Eternal Spring. The Patriarch, recognizing him as a vessel for the Dao, transmitted the teachings to him.

Having received the Dharma, the Master served in menial roles—cooking and tending the hearth—for over a decade, cultivating profound virtue. Even then, he was renowned for his strict discipline and purity. Later, he accompanied the Patriarch to the capital, residing at the Great Eternal Spring Abbey in Yanjing. After the Patriarch’s transcendence, the Perfected Qing He succeeded the lineage and appointed the Master to oversee the abbey’s affairs for six years. Under his stewardship, the abbey’s properties flourished without decay, harmony prevailed within and without, and all seemed sustained by an unseen guiding hand. In his later years, he retired to leisure.

In the spring of the *yimao* year, on the *gengwu* day of the second month, five days later on *jiaxu*, he took to his bed with a slight illness. Folding his arm beneath his head, he peacefully passed in the bedchamber of White Cloud Abbey. He was interred in the Assembly of Immortals’ Cemetery at Five Flowers Peak, having lived seventy-one years.

The elder Daoists remarked: After the Patriarch’s transcendence, the Master was entrusted by the two great Patriarchs, Qing He and Zhen Chang, to oversee the abbey’s affairs for many years. Daily, he managed the flow of goods—receiving and dispensing—an immeasurable abundance passing before him. Yet at the time of his encoffining, he possessed nothing beyond a single robe and undergarment. This is the first mark of his distinction. For over fifty years in the Daoist community, he never loosened his belt or rested his face upon a pillow—this is the second. As he neared his end, disciples inquired about funeral arrangements. He refused, saying, “I am departing. The pure and impure each return to their place. This transient dust may be buried or exposed, burned or left in the open—what does it matter? Do as you will.” This is the third.

In his speech and silence, movement and stillness, his humility, sincerity, and reverence accumulated day by day, manifesting in countless deeds. These three examples suffice to show how faithfully he upheld the transmission from his masters—precise, pure, and unshaken by external things.

His disciples, seeking to preserve his memory, recorded his life’s great deeds and entreated me to compose an inscription for the stele. Honoring the Master’s attainment, I have arranged these facts and appended this epitaph:

The beauty of all virtues
Lies hidden in sincerity.
How to discern it?
Observe his conduct.

For fifty years,
He never loosened his belt or rested his head—
Why did he not relent?
His heart was not like stone.

Wealth flowed like water,
Affairs like tangled silk—
Why did he not cling?
His heart was fundamentally empty.

Folding his arm, gathering his breath,
He did not obscure what he had attained.
Now, what remains?
The murmur of streams, the hues of mountains.

The false see falsehood,
The true see truth.
In our Daoist gate,
What a towering figure he was!

Elders and disciples,
Planning for eternity,
Inscribe these words,
To illuminate later ages.

**Stele Inscription for the Virtuous Conduct of Jing, the Perfected of White Cloud, Great Master of the Daoist Teachings**

Composed by Li Ting, Instructor of the Capital Prefecture Academy, *Shaohua*

The *Book of Documents* states: “The virtuous delight in goodness, finding each day insufficient,” for their hearts act without contrivance. The *Book of Changes* says: “The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings,” for Heaven never fails to reward.

When a man possesses extraordinary and outstanding conduct yet does not enjoy its fruits in his lifetime, his descendants surely will. Observing the father of the Perfected Jing of White Cloud, I note his tireless devotion to benevolence and righteousness. In aiding the poor and relieving the distressed, he was as constant as eating and drinking. His diligence was boundless.

Thus, Heaven cast its gaze upon him and brought forth a man of virtue, guiding him through the ministrations of immortals. In the end, he shed the filth of the mundane world and enjoyed the blessings of purity for nearly fifty years. Truly, “what is accumulated in darkness is repaid in light”—how could this not be believed?

The Perfected’s given name was Zhi Yuan, his courtesy name Zi Xuan. A native of Ye County in Laizhou, his great-grandfather Yuan Heng once served as Military Commissioner of Anhua Commandery. His great-grandfather Zhen and grandfather De Zhong both cherished reclusion, their virtue unostentatious. His father Zun was bright and resolute, his heart vast and unobstructed.

The Jing clan had long been prominent, its lineage numbering ten thousand. Among them were the destitute and unruly, whose burdens he willingly shouldered. When their needs were met, he never displayed the slightest air of obligation. When a villager was falsely accused and imprisoned, he pitied their innocence and took their place. In prison, he moved the jailers with kindness and trust, securing his own freedom of movement. He then devised strategies to exonerate many wrongfully imprisoned. Soon after, he too was pardoned.

In the Dading year of Dinghai, Patriarch Chongyang led his perfected masters westward, lodging at his home. There, he said to him: "In time, you shall have a son who will don the feathered robe."

Thereupon, he built Longxiang Abbey in his village, where morning and evening incense and offerings were reverently made to the celestial perfected. In the Taihe year of Yichou, famine struck, and the people bore the hue of hunger. He opened his private granaries to cook congee for them, saving countless lives. After the chaos of the Guiyou year’s warfare, corpses littered the wilds; braving cold and hardship, he personally gathered and buried them. When he found abandoned valuables, he would wait for their owners to reclaim them, and if none came, he distributed them to those in need.

His mother, née Zhang, was also a woman of refined virtue, known for her reverence and sincerity in serving her parents-in-law. In time, she gave birth to him—his temperament grave and steadfast, sparing of words and laughter, his bearing uncommon. By fifteen, when urged to study, he declined, saying: "It is not my nature. What I desire is the way of immortals and the art of light ascent." When his parents sought to compel him, he secluded himself in a chamber, purifying his form.

Thus was the Patriarch’s foresight confirmed. He then left home to take Qiu, the Great Master Changchun, as his teacher. In the Wuyin year, by the Master’s instruction, he assumed the abbacy of Laizhou’s Haotian Abbey. When the Great Yuan arose, Taizu, the Sagely Martial Emperor, endowed with divine benevolence and wisdom, yearned for the mystic wind. In the winter of Jimao, he dispatched his minister Liu Zhonglu with an imperial handwritten edict, providing a carriage to journey east to the seashore and summon the Master. The following spring, the Master set forth, accompanied by eighteen of his foremost disciples—he among them.

Through wind and rain, their hands calloused and feet blistered, they traversed tens of thousands of li to meet the Emperor on the southern slopes of the snowy mountains in the Western Regions. When the Emperor, emptying himself of preconceptions, inquired of governance, he replied: "The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is firm, the state is at peace. Having come, let them be settled—this is the essence of saving the world." These words, once presented, deeply resonated with the Emperor’s heart. His jade voice praised them, lamenting only their late meeting. Thereupon, he was granted a tiger tally and appointed to oversee all Daoist followers throughout the realm.

Upon their return, the Master halted his carriage atop Gold Mountain’s peak and, turning to Minister Yin Qinghe, said: "Master Jing has followed me through mountains and rivers, lodging by day and night, ever more reverent—truly diligent. Observing his bearing, he shall surely be the one to propagate my teachings." Minister Yin replied: "Indeed."

Upon arriving in Yan, the Patriarch took residence at the Taiyi Palace, which was soon renamed the Great Everlasting Spring Palace. He entrusted the Master with oversight of the palace gates, bestowing upon him the title of *Great Perfected Master of Purity and Truth*. Later, he conferred upon him the scriptures of *Aiding the State and Saving the People*, and ordained Daoists such as Hao Zhiyang to assist in sweeping and maintenance.

After the Patriarch ascended as an immortal, he left a final command for Qinghe to succeed him in leading the Daoist community. The Master supported him without fail from beginning to end. In the spring of the *jiawu* year, Qinghe entrusted him with the eastern regions of the mountains. Wherever he traveled, senior masters and revered elders came to welcome him, and cartloads of grain and silk piled at his hall numbered in the thousands. Could such influence have been achieved without sincere virtue and wondrous conduct to move people and awaken things?

In the spring of the *wuxu* year, Emperor Taizong the Cultured issued an edict to select eminent Daoists. Following the directive, Zhenchang Li, the *Perfected Master of the Everlasting Teaching*, was summoned to court. That winter, by imperial decree, he assisted Dongzhen Yu in reestablishing the ancestral court at Zhongnan, overseeing Daoist affairs in Shaanxi. In the spring of the *gengzi* year, he entered Chang’an at the request of local officials. He established the Great Mysterious Capital Longevity Palace, and restored sites such as White Deer on Mount Li, Taiyi on Zhongnan, White Cloud in Fanchuan, Longevity on Phoenix Perch, and Gold Mountain in Lantian—renovating their old structures anew. The repair and restoration of other palaces and temples were too numerous to record.

In autumn, the Grand Preceptor Yila and Governor Tian each dispatched envoys to accompany the Master in presenting a memorial to Yan, inviting Qinghe to conduct the Patriarch’s grand funeral rites. After their completion, in the spring of the *jiachen* year, the Vanguard Commander Jiagu held a *Luotian* Grand Offering at the ancestral court, formally inviting Dongzhen, Song Piyun, Xue Taixia, the Master, and Li Wuyu to serve as the Five Perfected Ones, presiding over the ritual. Coincidentally, Prince Yongchang dispatched the emissary Zhao Chongjian to conduct a *Golden Register* Grand Offering for the state’s blessings. Thus, he once again joined the Perfected Ones in the rites. Observing their solemn and precise presentations, with divine marvels clearly manifest, the returning envoys reported these events in full. Consequently, the Emperor summoned them for an audience, treating them with great reverence and bestowing upon the Five Perfected Ones titles of honor. The Master was accordingly granted the title *Perfected of the White Cloud, Vast Teacher of the Daoist Gate*.

In the winter of the *dingwei* year, the Grand Preceptor Yila held a *Yellow Register* Grand Offering at the Yude Abbey, where over a hundred participants collapsed in prostration before the altar. In the spring of the *wushen* year, the Empress Dowager sent the emissary Yang Zhongming bearing an imperial decree, bestowing upon him a golden tally, ceremonial robes, and confirming his position as before.

In the summer of the *xinhai* year, Emperor Xianzong ascended the throne and dispatched the envoy Tanggu with an imperial edict, entrusting him with the governance of Daoism in Guanzhong. In the *guichou* year, the Emperor’s younger brother sent the envoy Tuoju with a swift decree, treating him with the respect due a teacher. In the sixth month of the *yimao* year, rising without illness in the morning, he suddenly gathered his disciples and said to Shen Zhixin: "I am about to depart. You shall succeed me in this office and manage what follows." He then ordered preparations for his funeral.

On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, he passed away peacefully, aged sixty-six. The following year, he was reburied beside the ancestral court’s immortal burial grounds to the northwest. In the winter of the *jiwei* year, his disciples sought to erect a stele. Zhixin, along with the abbey’s overseers Guo Deshan and Li Zhixi, recorded his deeds and came to request an inscription. Though he declined thrice, he ultimately complied, carefully arranging the account.

As for the Master’s character: he was modest and unassuming, seemingly inarticulate, yet when discussing matters of saving the age and benefiting all things, he stood firm as a mountain, his words and demeanor stern, his speech always well-founded. All were convinced, and thus the Patriarch uniquely relied upon him. After coming to Guanzhong, his reputation in the Dao grew daily. He maintained a serene and unadorned demeanor, never resorting to strange or extravagant speech to deceive the ignorant. At that time, high officials and renowned figures flocked to him in admiration, and disciples from all directions were beyond count. Thus, his name reached the imperial court, and he repeatedly received honors and rewards. Without pure and steadfast conduct, how could this have been achieved?

Now, the reason most people sink into delusion is desire and profit, yet the Master resolutely severed himself from these, regarding wealth and goods as no more than spittle. His natural disposition surpassed others by far. Thus, this stele is inscribed without doubt, and appended with this eulogy:

*Jing was of a noted lineage, dwelling by the sea’s edge,*
*Generations nurtured hidden virtue, giving birth to a sage.*
*Heaven endowed him with a nature, pure and unadorned,*
*Uncarved and unpolished, preserving his true essence.*

*He came to receive the warning, following Everlasting Spring,*
*Secret teachings and arcane formulas, passed down in intimacy.*
*He cleaved his heart to cast off cunning, focusing his spirit,*
*Steadfast to the end, unstained by worldly dust.*

*The sagely emperor sought the Dao, raising the hidden from obscurity,*
*Journeying ten thousand li to follow his master, meeting at the Purple Court.*
*A single word halted slaughter, such was his benevolence,*
*His merit filled heaven and earth—who could compare?*

*Extending his legacy, he refined our Qin,*
*Feeding on harmony, drinking kindness, taming the fierce and wild.*
*Successive sages upheld the teaching, its influence ever-growing,*
*Golden crowns and crane robes—new honors bestowed.*

*Grand halls and towering structures, resplendent and vast,*
*He wandered and dwelled in ease, spending his life thus.*
*His work accomplished, he departed the world, ascending as a guest on high,*
*Coming and going freely, his arm bending and stretching at will.*

*What does not perish is his boundless longevity,*
*His disciples record his virtue, carving jade to preserve his memory.*
*For a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, we gaze upon his radiant dust.*

*Records of the Immortal Spring of Ganshui, Scroll Five—Concluded*

The Daoist Li Daoqian of the Celestial Joy Gate of Yimen Compiles
*The Stele of Master Li’s Fundamental Conduct, the Perfected of Non-Desire and Wondrous Truth of Chongyang Wanshou Palace on Mount Zhongnan*

Composed by He Daoning, Proclaimed Master of the Mysteries, Commissioner of the Teaching in the Five Circuits of Shaanxi and the Xingyuan Circuit, concurrently overseeing the affairs of Chongyang Wanshou Palace

He who angles for six turtles in the Eastern Sea does not cast his hook for mere fins;
He who gathers trees of arm-thick girth in Deng Forest does not wield his axe for slender branches.
If one’s aspiration is set upon the great, trifling matters are not contested.
Now observing the true conduct of Non-Desire, his resolve soars beyond the mundane—is this not akin to such a one?

The Master’s clan name was Li, his given name Zhongmei, originally a man of Yueshan.
His father, Zhen, held the office of brewer. Of four sons, the Master was the second, born in the *jichou* year of the Dading era.
At five, he first learned to walk. As he grew, his intelligence surpassed his peers, his bearing forthright and unyielding. He carried himself with unwavering integrity, and whenever cunning or deceitful men appeared in his village, he would rebuke them with forthright words, so that all who saw him stood in awe and submission.
Once, he indulged freely in wine, regarding the world entire as unworthy of his regard.
At thirty-seven, he suddenly declared: “Rather than drown in the dusty hall, why not cast off the fetters of the world beyond?”

At that time, the Quanzhen teachings were flourishing, and he wished to take a master but did not yet know where to turn. By chance, Master Yang Bixu presided over the affairs of the Chongyang Ancestral Hall, so he went to meet him. Bixu, who had long discerned a person’s nature in the glance of an eye, recognized him as a vessel of great potential for the Daoist gate. Yet, mindful of the bonds of kinship that weighed upon him, he surmised there were matters he could not easily resolve in his heart. Thus, he sent him home, merely exhorting him to accumulate goodness.

Upon returning, the Master bid farewell to his kin and friends, then parted from his wife and children. His wife reviled him, but he merely smiled and paid her no heed. When his father saw this and rebuked him, the Master softened his words and enlightened him with the principles of reason and nature. His father gradually came to understand, and wishing to follow the Dao himself, they together sought out Bixu’s gate. Bixu, recognizing the Master’s uncommon insight and capacity, bestowed upon him the name Shouning and the sobriquet Wuyuzi.

With disheveled hair and tattered robes, the Master begged in the marketplace, and the people of the time called him the "Wine-Loving Master Li." In his daily affairs, he took it as his duty to aid others and benefit all things. As for the subtle and profound principles of the Dao, he truly attained their utmost depths.

In the *gengwu* year of the Da’an era, a great drought struck the lands of Qin, and the people were cut off by famine. The Master said to his followers: "With starvation before our eyes, how can we bear to sit idly by?" A townsman, Zhao Sanlang, was the wealthiest man in Guanzhong. The Master went to his door and vividly described the hardships and distress of the countryside. Zhao was moved and opened his granaries, entrusting the grain to the Master for relief efforts. The Master, together with Qi Zhidao and others, worked day and night to hull and cook the grain, providing for the poor and sick, with no fewer than a hundred people aided each day. When the well water ran dry, the people grew anxious, but the Master secretly prayed to the spirits, dug a spring, and found water. The relief efforts continued until autumn, when they were concluded.

The Master had no desire to make his name known and feared being recognized. That very day, he set out westward. Later, officials reported his deeds, and Zhao was specially granted the title "Benefactor of the State." Shortly after, he entered Huan Residence in Xingping, setting a thousand-day covenant. His wondrous practices in stillness are recorded in the *Chang’an Collection*.

When the appointed time arrived, the Quhe Envoy Jiagu and several elders came to Huan Residence to earnestly request that he take charge of Longxiang Abbey in the south of the county. The Master agreed. After residing there for five years, in the *gengchen* year of the Xingding era, he moved to Louguan on Mount Zhongnan for another five years, then relocated to Danxia in Jingzhao. Soon after, he received his master’s decree to oversee the construction of Bixu Abbey in Sanyuan. Wherever he stayed, he left behind established rules.

In the spring of the *wuzǐ* year of the Zhengda era, Bixu, in the ancestral chamber of the Chongyang Hall, declared that the Master could be relied upon and appointed him as his successor. When turmoil erupted in Guanzhong, the Master and the people—both military and civilian—took refuge in the Southern Mountains. When their provisions ran out and people began to prey upon one another, nearly reaching the Master, someone said: "This is the Wine-Loving Master Li, a man of the Dao." Thus, they protected him and escorted him out of the mountains, and he was spared.

In the spring of the *gengyin* year, he traveled to Nanyang, where many sought to follow him. At that time, Master Li Chongxu and Master Yu Dongzhen were in Bianjing. Chongxu petitioned for him to serve as abbot of Danyang Abbey. In the *guisi* year, Bianjing submitted to our dynasty. Soon after, a sudden dispute arose, and the innocent were all condemned to execution. The Master and an elder hid in a marshy lake, pressed by the flames of violence. The elder trembled uncontrollably, but the Master calmed him, saying: "All our past conduct has been for this very moment. Life and death are ordinary affairs—what is there to fear?" In the end, they were spared.

When the city ran out of grain, the people clamored to cross the river to the north, but the ferrymen stubbornly refused. Tens of thousands starved or drowned. The Master asked Dongzhen to go first, then secretly persuaded the ferrymen to yield, and the rest were all saved. The Master then reached Xinwei, where his disciples flocked to him like spokes to a hub. The founding of Lingxu Tianqing’s splendid abbey began from this.

The following year, he led his followers to Yan. At that time, Master Yin Qinghe presided over the teachings. Whenever the community discussed matters concerning the ancestral hall, all deferred to the Master’s abilities. The Master declined, saying he was unworthy, but was again petitioned to serve as abbot of Chongyang Palace and concurrently as supervisor of the Shaanxi Daoist community. His name was changed to Zhiyuan, and he was entrusted with great responsibilities.

The Master set out on his journey home, passing through Lu and Wei. From marquises down to commoners, all lined the roads to welcome him. Some offered him hermitages and abbeys, some wished to become his disciples, and some donated wealth. The Master accepted nothing for himself, instead dedicating it all to the ancestral hall. When Tian Deji, the Marquis of Jingzhao, heard of the Master’s return to the west, he sent his aides to meet him near the Yellow River and granted him Youde Abbey in the prefectural city—now Jade Clarity Palace.

At that time, Guanzhong had just been pacified, and violent men stirred up trouble. The Master guided them with kind words, gradually turning their hearts. In recent years, captives from the southern campaigns arrived without cease. The Master inquired after their masters, and those who were inclined toward goodness he earnestly exhorted, leading them to the Dao. For those who could not be persuaded, he arranged to ransom them, providing them with official documents and allowing them to go free. Those deeply moved by his compassion could not bear to leave.

The Master frequently traveled between the ancestral hall and Jade Clarity Palace, yet his plans and arrangements were always devoted to the ancestral hall. In the autumn of the *bingshen* year, he received a letter from Master Qinghe urging him to oversee the burial of the ancestral master. The presiding master, Zhenchang, also entrusted him with the affairs of the ancestral hall. In the tenth month of winter, he was decreed supervisor of Chongyang Palace.

The following year, the scholars of Qin planned to repair the Confucian temple but lacked tiles. The prefectural judge Na Bangyong and others petitioned the Master, who provided all they needed. The scholars all praised him.

In the spring of the *gengzǐ* year, by imperial decree, he was specially granted the title "Perfected Master Wuyu of the Wondrous Dao." In the seventh month of autumn, Hao, the commander of Hebei, had over a hundred household retainers secretly plotting to flee south. When their plot was uncovered, he intended to execute them all. Upon hearing this, the Master rode through the night to Hao’s door and admonished him with kind words, and the fugitives were all spared.

The following year, hundreds of petty villains in the city formed secret alliances. Han Yuan, the military governor, learned of their plans and intended to execute them in the marketplace as a warning. Moved by the Master’s words, he only punished the ringleaders.

The Grand Preceptor Yilie Baojian, upon his mother’s death, wished to bury two maidservants as sacrificial attendants. The Master corrected this with the ancient rites of burial, and the plan was abandoned. From then on, the custom of burying living persons to accompany the dead among the Khitan people was gradually abolished.

In the spring of the *bǐngwǔ* year, an imperial edict ordered the performance of a grand *jiao* ritual throughout the realm in Yan Prefecture, and the Master participated. In the fourth month of summer, he returned from Wei, and the magistrate of Bian Prefecture again invited him to reside in Danyang. Duke Wang of Qiyun received him with full ceremonial honors outside the city. As they sat together, the Master’s expression suddenly grew urgent, and he instructed his disciples to depart at once. No one understood the reason. No sooner had they boarded the boat than the southern army had already surrounded the gates of the capital—his foresight was often of this kind.

The following year, he returned to his abode. In the eighth month of autumn, an imperial decree bestowed upon him the title "Perfected Master Xuanwei," and soon after, he was honored with ceremonial robes. In the spring of the *jiǎyín* year, the Patriarch, on behalf of the state’s *jiao* affairs, sent a written invitation. Though the Master was already eighty-six years old, he dared not decline on account of his advanced age. By the time he reached the hall, his illness had grown severe. He entrusted his final affairs to his dharma-brother, the Great Master of the Extended Reality, Zhang Zhiyue, and had his disciples bow to the Patriarch as their Grand Preceptor. Then, at the Hour of Long Spring in Fanghu, he composed a eulogy and shed his mortal form. It was the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month of summer. His disciples carried his coffin west and interred it beside the ancestral tomb on Mount Zhongnan—a fitting rite.

The following year, Zhiyue instructed Li Zhi’an and Chen Zhiyuan to compile the Master’s deeds and present them to the Patriarch, seeking to have them engraved in stone. Daoning, who happened to be attending to matters in the hall, was summoned by the Patriarch to take up the brush. The Patriarch said: "Wuyu has led the ancestral court for many years. Now that you have succeeded him, you must know his life and deeds thoroughly. It is only right that you compose the text." Daoning no longer declined and, carefully examining the visible conduct of Wuyu, composed the following account:

There are great ones who uphold the Mysterious Teaching, and there must also be benevolent ones who assist it. The great ones rectify themselves and thereby rectify all things. Our Patriarch, with his dignified demeanor, awakens all beings, and the Daoist adepts of the world observe and are transformed by him. Master Wuyu aided and supported the Teaching with benevolence, keeping the ancestral root steadfast and unbroken. He truly fulfilled the trust our Patriarch placed in him.

In his person, the Master embodied the qi of unyielding integrity and uprightness, maintaining a conduct of independent resolve. His transmission had a source, and his cultivation had a foundation. Thus, in all his deeds, he accomplished them with benevolence. In times of peril, he took the lead; when others faced distress, he exhausted his strength to rescue them before resting. To those who sought the secrets of cultivating the True, he urged accumulation and diligence. With those capable of discussing the matters of nature and destiny, he would speak until the deep of night without tiring. Even when conversing with children, he was earnest and never wearied. As for renowned scholars and great officials, he delighted in their company, forgetting all distinctions of rank.

In his interactions, he discerned others’ capacities and struck precisely at their potential. Yet he treated others with restraint and maintained humility in himself. Among the multitude, he was dignified but not harsh, harmonious but not indulgent. Though he dwelt in a humble abode for four or five years, the marvels of his spiritual transformations were such that to record them plainly would risk being dismissed as exaggeration. Yet considering his constant conduct in movement and stillness, speech and silence, he may indeed be called a rare figure of this world. Thus, this stele is carved without hesitation.

His eulogy reads:
How grand was Master Li!
Concentrating qi to attain suppleness,
His resolve was firm,
His conduct all-encompassing.
He resolved myriad affairs,
Yet never schemed for personal gain.
Unwavering in purpose,
He led by example.
Such a man—
Amidst the world’s turmoil,
Did he seek the wanderings of the Imperial Homeland?
I know he severed all entanglements
And returned in clarity to rest.

*Eulogy for the Perfected Master Wuyu by the Perfected Master of Ziyang*

On the twenty-third day of the first month of the *yǐmǎo* year of the Great Mongol State, the first day of the month being *jǐhài*, your friend Yang Huan, former Transport Commissioner of Henan and concurrently Chief Inspector, retired and serving Heaven, respectfully offers this sacrifice to the Perfected Master Wuyu.

In the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras, there was the Venerable Master Hao. Of lofty nature and disposition, he conducted himself with utmost care. He whistled to the moon and chanted to the wind at the foot of Mount Song. Those with whom he associated were none other than Li the Banished Immortal and Kong Chaofu.

Then there was Zhang Zhihe, known as the Master of the Mysterious Truth. He made his home upon the waters, drifting through the years in freedom. His heart was with the fish, and he fished without bait. At times, he would visit Du Shaoyou, the Imperial Inspector, or Yan Lugong, the Prefect of a commandery. With staff and sandals, he came and went, and to this day, these are recounted as fine tales.

As for me—what am I? A mere examination graduate, my office not that of Yan or Du, my talent not that of Kong or Li. Yet in my humble retreat, I shared a bond with the Perfected Master of the Cavern Truth, Wuyu—just the two of us.

When I lodged in the capital, it was the *guǐsì* year. The imperial troops crossed south, and blood flowed for a thousand *li*. The twelve gates of the capital were shut and would not open. One death, one life—your vow still rings in my ears.

Recently, I received an urgent summons by courier to enter Chang’an. By then, the Perfected Master of the Cavern Truth had already shed his mortal form—alas, how long ago! When I met the Perfected Master, he poured out all that was within him. His gaze was like lightning, piercing the night without sleep. Green mountains filled my eyes, but official documents piled high.

In the fifth month of a sweltering summer, a brain abscess afflicted me. At midnight, I entrusted you with all that must be said in the face of death. At dawn, I would fall; by dusk, I would be buried. Though my allotted time was not yet done, I forced myself to rise.

The Perfected Master entered Yan and suddenly departed this world. Upon hearing the news of his passing, my aged tears flowed like water. His jade bones returned north, and my homeland mourned. Letters arrived in rapid succession, knocking at my thorn-gate. A white horse, a plain carriage—traveling far across the clear waters of the Wei. Three libations of raw silk, a small repayment for a true friend. If you recall our past, how can I not weep? Never again shall we meet. May you partake of this offering.

The Master’s name was Zhiheng, his courtesy name Botong, and his sobriquet Serene Illumination. He was a native of Fenglan in Tong Prefecture and a descendant of the Prince of Ying of the Five Dynasties.

The Master was by nature bright and quick-witted. He pursued the path of the imperial examinations and, having just reached the age of twenty, was recommended by his prefecture to the capital, where he took residence at the Imperial Academy. Twice he sat for the palace examinations but did not pass. Coinciding with the Chongqing military upheaval, he returned home to find solace in poetry and books, no longer concerning himself with the affairs of an examination candidate. The military commissioner of his prefecture, Aotun Su, invited him to serve as acting instructor, but the Master declined, citing his own inadequacy. When the great army marched west, the Master crossed northward and took refuge in Dexing, living in seclusion without venturing out.

In the year *guiwei*, the Venerable Changchun returned from the northern palace and passed through the region. The Master, having long been nourished by the sagely learning of the past, now found in this encounter the catalyst for a true teacher’s inspiration—summoned from without, his inner celestial mechanism responded at once. Like the crane’s call answered by its mate, the resonance was irresistible and unyielding. Soon after, he expressed his wish to receive the Master’s staff and join the ranks of his disciples. First, he paid homage to the Perfected Zhenchang to secure an introduction. Zhenchang, upon meeting him, felt an immediate affinity, and thus brought him before the Venerable Changchun, who did not treat him as an ordinary man.

Upon returning to Yan, one evening the Venerable Changchun pointed to the Master and said to two or three senior disciples: "This man shall one day uphold the future of our Daoist tradition." The Master silently inscribed these words in his heart. Several years later, as the Venerable Changchun prepared to return to the True Abode, the assembly entreated him regarding the matter of succession. The Master replied: "I have already entrusted this to Botong. There is no need to speak further."

After the Venerable Changchun’s transcendent departure, the Master said to the Perfected Qinghe: "The flourishing of Daoism since the beginning of time has never equaled its present state. The Venerable Changchun was a man in appearance but celestial in nature. The future of our tradition rests with you—is this not the will of Heaven? I urge you not to decline further." Thereupon, he gathered the Daoist assembly, along with high officials, noble clans, eminent elders from across the land, and the influential Lord Liu, and went to the Master’s quiet chamber to formally request the establishment of the transcendent’s posthumous title. Initially, Qinghe shut his door and refused entry, but the Master forced it open, supported him to the hall, and had the assembly bow in reverence below. Once the title and rank were properly established, the mystic wind flourished greatly—this was the Master’s achievement.

In the year *yiwei*, Qinghe traveled to the ancestral court to propagate the teachings in the regions of Qin and Jin. He secretly sent the Master a handwritten letter: "I am old and must depart. To be weary in old age or idle in youth—neither is fitting. Moreover, the sequence of the four seasons shows that those who have fulfilled their work depart, while those yet to do so arrive. You must act decisively, for the times cannot be resisted." Upon receiving the letter, the Master reflected: "Zhenchang has administered these affairs for a decade. Those who know of it include not only the Daoist assembly but also the celestial court above and the rustics below. This is the will of Heaven—how could it be subject to personal preference or objection?"

In the year *dingyou*, Qinghe returned to the palace by imperial decree. The Master then retrieved the rites established at the beginning of the Yuan dynasty for supporting and sustaining Qinghe, formalized them as precedents, and implemented them, thereby establishing Zhenchang. Once this was accomplished, Qinghe retired to a life of leisure in a realm of self-contentment, while Zhenchang assumed the weighty responsibility of the tradition with boundless wisdom.

That both these Perfected Ones maintained their integrity in both advancement and retreat was also the Master’s achievement. Earlier, by imperial decree, he had been appointed instructor to eighteen noble scions. The Master selected from among the sons of eminent families an equal number of those with gentle and respectful dispositions to serve as their companions in study. He had them read the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, the *Mencius*, the *Doctrine of the Mean*, and the *Great Learning*, so that through oral transmission and heartfelt reception, the ground of inherent virtue in each might daily become more luminous. They would come to understand that the Dao of governing the state and pacifying the world begins with rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention. Thereafter, with each passing day and month, they indeed established themselves, not only gaining high office but also earning renown among scholars for their talent and virtue.

Furthermore, he persuaded the Pacification Commissioner, Lord Wang, to transform the Bureau of Military Affairs into a Temple of the Venerated Sage, and instructed his disciple Xue Detang to repair the Martial Temple and maintain its sacrifices. He also established the Five Peaks Abbey and over ten Daoist hermitages as places for the cultivation and advancement of Daoists. In the winter of *gengzi*, the Grand Preceptor of Jingzhao and the Commander-in-Chief Tian, among others, requested that Qinghe rebury the Ancestral Master Chongyang. The Master was appointed as assistant. The journey from Yan to Qin spanned over three thousand *li*. Along the way, wherever they passed Daoist abbeys and temples, those in ruins were restored, and those incomplete were completed—over a hundred in total. Of these, the Master composed inscriptions for twelve or thirteen, which were carved into stone.

After the Ancestral Master’s reburial was completed, he accompanied Qinghe back to the palace. In the year *wushen*, the Great Master Zhenchang was granted a golden fence and purple robes in accordance with imperial favor, promoted to Director of Daoist Affairs and Acting Head of the Daoist Tradition, and bestowed with his present title—a mark of imperial esteem. When the establishment of the Mystic Learning was proposed, the Master once again lent his support with the intention of fostering the next generation, ensuring its eventual success.

In the autumn of *jiayin*, on the twenty-third day of the eighth month, he manifested illness and attained the True. He lived seventy-five years. On the twenty-sixth day, he was buried on the southwestern plain of Five Flower Mountain, in accordance with ritual. The day after his transformation, I, Zhao, offered a eulogy and libations at his spirit casket. His disciples Xue Deshan and Yao Zhixuan presented the Master’s *xingzhuang* and requested an epitaph to be carved in stone as a memorial.

I, Zhao, was honored with the Master’s deepest friendship and thus knew him most intimately. Therefore, I did not decline the task. Moreover, Zhenchang, upon first meeting this elder, felt as though they had known each other for a lifetime. He introduced him to the Vast and Perfected Master’s gate, where they donned Daoist caps and robes together. He also had a chamber built to the right of the palace for the Master to reside in. From their first encounter to his transformation, thirty-five years passed. Among those with whom he associated were Liang, the Transport Commissioner of the South, Chen Xiuyu, Academician of the Hanlin, and Wu Deming, Minister of Justice. Whenever they discussed the figures of the age, they regarded the Master as possessing the capacity of a chief minister. His refined bearing and lofty character were thus self-evident.

Surveying the actual deeds of the Three Generations’ patriarchs, there was not a single matter they did not consult or rely upon one another to accomplish. Moreover, in the days before and after his transformation, they met and exchanged visits several times in a state between dreaming and wakefulness. Could it be that within the realm where each person’s mind harmonizes with the true principle, there exists a mutual resonance beyond form and sound? How else could their sincerity and qi align so perfectly, with no barrier between them, reaching such a degree?

Some, however, privately speculated that this was merely because they shared a Confucian background. Such views are but the narrow perceptions of private wisdom. After his transformation, Zhenchang offered this eulogy: “Thirty-five years we shared company, never bound by power, never drawn by wealth. From our first meeting, we understood each other without words. Now you have departed through transformation, transcending the human realm. Who can fathom the workings of your spirit? How could those confined by private wisdom ever comprehend this?”

Thus, I firmly declare: Had it been otherwise, how could he have attained the serenity and illumination of *jizhao*? The inscription reads:

Majestic in aiding the Mysterious,
Vast and impartial,
Like still water responding to things,
Unmoved by external change.

Ritual and wisdom, a single flame;
Benevolence, the dwelling; righteousness, the path.
Though talent and virtue were both his,
The times did not favor his rise.

Admiring the gate’s treasured jade,
He feigned foolishness all day.
Yet whether in adversity or prosperity,
Is the sagely Dao truly different?

Suddenly encountering Changchun,
Like stars circling the North Star,
A single kindness dispensed as medicine,
His virtue daily renewed.

He personally restored the Confucian temple,
And succeeded in rebuilding the Martial Temple.
The Way of civil and martial governance
Seemed poised for fulfillment.

What he inaugurated
Was no small contribution.
In aiding the flourishing of the Mysterious Teaching,
He foretold a grand future.

Like Jing’s gold and Zhao’s jade,
Radiant yet not dazzling,
His brilliance shone outwardly,
While sincerity and clarity illuminated within.

Once a non-omen like the bear,
Now his learning soared like the dragon.
In that era, they converged,
Unplanned yet in perfect accord.

Engraved in metal and stone,
Though all things fade in time,
His noble virtue and flowing influence
Shall never be exhausted.

**Inscription for the Stele of Master Meng, the Vast Virtue and Dao-Broadening Perfected**
*Composed by Li Ding of Taiyuan, the Empty Boat Daoist*

The Master’s name was Zhiyuan, his courtesy name Deqing, and his Daoist name Chongxuanzi. His ancestors were originally the Tutan clan of the Upper Capital. At the end of the Dading era, they relocated to Jiaoshui in Laizhou, residing in the Meng family estate. People thus attributed the Meng surname to them, much like the ancients who took their names from their fiefs.

His great-grandfather Ji passed away while serving as Military Commissioner of Fenyang. His great-grandmother was Lady Wan-yan, sister of Prince Xi-yin of the Jin source. His grandfather Ke-ning married the Lady of Jiaxiang County and served four emperors—Xizong, Hailing, Xingling, and Daoling—rising through merit to become Grand Preceptor, enfeoffed as the Prince of Min, and posthumously honored as *Zhonglie* (Loyal and Martial). His father Xiege declined hereditary succession as a chiliarch and ended his career as Vice Military Commissioner of the Southern Capital. His father, Jida, resumed the hereditary chiliarch position, and his mother was Lady Wulin-da.

Examining the *Biographies of Eminent Ministers of the Jin*, his family’s legacy was indeed illustrious. Yet during the Dading, Mingchang, and Taihe eras, had another been in his place, few would have escaped being swept away by the allure of wealth and splendor. The Master alone, from childhood, bore the weight of nobility yet delighted in simplicity. Could this have been possible without the force of long-cultivated nature?

In the early Mingchang era, famine struck, and Gao Xiang of Jimo gathered a bandit horde to plunder. The court ordered the Master’s father to suppress them. He declared: “Food is the people’s heaven. With it, they live; without it, they die. To resist death and seek life is the common impulse of the petty. To punish them for this—how does that make one a parent to the people?” He then proclaimed the emperor’s virtue, distributed grain from the granaries, and spared every life, thereby pacifying the rebellion.

An ancient saying goes: “He who saves a thousand lives will surely have illustrious descendants.” That the Master could resolve such a crisis must have been due to the unseen support of his ancestors’ accumulated merit and abundant blessings.

The Master had three elder brothers and six younger brothers. One brother rose to the rank of *Piaoji* (General of the Cavalry), another to *Fuguo* (State Auxiliary), while the rest upheld the family’s reputation. In the Taihe *guihai* year, when his parents discussed his marriage, the Master fled directly to the Yuqing Palace in Weizhou, where he met Patriarch Changchun and requested to become his disciple. The Patriarch, pitying his noble birth yet admiring his extraordinary bearing, foresaw that he would become a great vessel of the Mysterious Gate. He thus granted his request and bestowed his current name.

His parents suspected the abbot of the Fourth Quanzhen Abbey of concealing him and reported the matter to the authorities. Upon hearing this, the Master returned home to declare his resolve. His parents, realizing his determination could not be swayed, arranged for him to reside in the Second Du’s Lezhen Abbey (later renamed Yuqing).

Though the Master received the Dao from Changchun, during his cultivation he also sought guidance from Masters Yuyang and Taigu. Yuyang bestowed upon him the name Kaizhenzi. In the Tai’an *jisi* year, Changchun was summoned to the capital and later returned to reside at Yuqing. Recognizing the Master’s attainment, he granted him the name Chongxuanzi in commendation.

In the Zhenyou *guiyou* year, the Master’s brothers were scattered by war, and his parents left without support. He then brought them to his residence, devoting three years to their care. Even after his two elder brothers returned, he never neglected the rites of attendance and respect.

In the *jimao* year, the imperial court dispatched Liu Zhonglu to summon Changchun from the seacoast. Among his disciples, eighteen were selected for their pure conduct and solid practice to accompany him. The Master was one of them. When they traversed the vast desert, each of the heavy carts was managed by two people—only the Master drove his alone. Qinghe, pitying his toil, requested to assist the Patriarch, who replied: “I know this man’s diligence. I wish to let him first undertake what others find difficult, for he will surely reap great rewards thereafter.”

Hearing this, the Master said: “This disciple owes to my teacher a debt as vast as Mount Tai—how could I not take up the task of driving the cart myself? For me, I know not what I seek, nor do I feel it a toil.” From then on, though the journey brought a hundred hardships, all who traveled with him vied to press forward. In the *xinsi* year, they reached the Abuhan Mountains in the west, where they first encountered Han people tilling the land; there, the Master and eight others established the Qixia Abbey. In the *guiwei* year, he resided at Longyang in Dexing. In the *jiashen* year, Master Changchun, by imperial decree, took up residence at the Taiji Palace in Yanjing, soon after renamed Changchun; the Master also came from Longyang. In the *dinghai* year, the Patriarch attained the True, and the Master was forty-one. One day, as he sat in quiet meditation within a chamber, he suddenly saw in a vision the true forms of Masters Chongyang, Changzhen, and Changchun. After bowing, he stood in attendance, and the Patriarch spoke: “Your lifespan shall reach seventy-five.” Master Changchun said: “After fifty, you will bear heavy responsibilities for the teaching. Though the affairs may be onerous, do not shrink from them—for they are the whetstone that grinds you, the forge and furnace that temper you.” With these words, they vanished without a trace. Soon after, he felt within his body every passage open and the true *qi* flowing upward, ascending the *weilü*, entering the *niwan*. From that day forward, day by day, his spirit and essence transformed: golden nectar and jade elixir, the Yellow Court and the Crimson Palace, irrigated and suffused him in ways beyond words. The Master then carefully examined the records of past Patriarchs who had attained the Dao, finding their accounts of inner transformations in perfect accord with his own. From that time on, though he faced hardship and upheaval, his mind never strayed from this path. The principles of circulation he had realized within never ceased—how boundless must have been the joy he felt in that moment!

By the time of Perfected Qinghe’s assumption of the patriarchal teaching office, he was appointed Vice-Superintendent of the Changchun Abbey, and soon thereafter promoted to Abbey Superintendent. In the year *wuxu* (1238), he was made Gate Supervisor of the Abbey. In *bingwu* (1246), he was elevated to Gate Inspector. In *wushen* (1248), he was entrusted with provisional oversight of the Teaching Office. In *jiyou* (1249), by imperial grace, he was bestowed a golden crown and purple robes, along with the honorific title "Great Master of Supreme Virtue, Mystic Emptiness, and Realized Truth."

In *guichou* (1253), the Patriarchal Master Zhenchang, by imperial command, conducted a grand ordination and registration of precepts, designating him as the Ordination Supervisor. In *bingchen* (1256), after Zhenchang’s ascension, the Perfected Chengming, Master Zhang, succeeded to the teaching office. In deference to his seniority in the Mystic Gate and his period of mourning, he conferred upon him the seal of Chief Inspector of the Teaching Office, entrusting him with its administration.

In the autumn of *wuwu* (1258), at the invitation of Chancellor Hu, he presided over the Yellow Register and Luo Heaven Grand Offering in Pingyang. Shortly thereafter, by imperial decree, he was granted his present title of Perfected. In the second year of *Zhongtong* (1261), in the year *xinyou*, he was seventy-five years of age, having ordained over five hundred disciples, with abbeys and temples in corresponding number.

On the second day of the second lunar month that spring, he aligned with the Dao and transformed, having previously entrusted his disciples with posthumous arrangements. All who attended him found his hearing keen, his vision clear, and his speech as resonant and fluent as ever—none believed he would depart. Only then did they realize how far his attainment surpassed others.

Three days later, he was interred in the Immortal’s Cemetery of Wuhua Mountain, in accordance with his final instructions. As for his ordination of disciples and establishment of abbeys, these were but the visible traces of his labors, evident to all and thus fit for recounting. Though he neared eighty, his spirit remained undiminished, and his final moments were as lucid as described. His lifelong inner cultivation must have been of a subtlety and refinement beyond the perception of ordinary people—how could such things be easily expressed?

On the day of his funeral, officials, scholars, and commoners thronged before and behind the procession, stirring the entire capital. The reverence of the Daoist community need not be stated. In the ninth lunar month of that autumn, his disciples recorded his deeds and entreated me for an inscription. I have here arranged the facts in order and appended this epitaph:

*Soft wood, pliable as silk,*
*Yet when the floods rose to the heavens,*
*It stood firm as Mount Zhiyu—*
*These two virtues, he possessed in full.*
*Having possessed them, let me now proclaim them.*

*At his first encounter with the Perfected Master,*
*He grasped the true principle.*
*Observing his nature, it was already extraordinary.*
*Upon assuming the great abbey,*
*He remained upright and unbiased.*
*Over forty years, he surpassed all others.*

*Were he not the one, the Dao would not manifest in vain.*
*Without a root, the Dao could not arise.*
*Trace his filial piety, trace his sincerity—*
*His root was firmly established, and the Dao was bound to flourish.*

*What others saw were but the visible traces of his labors.*
*What he attained was the wondrous distinction between truth and illusion.*
*Heaven and earth are but a single finger;*
*All things are but a single horse.*
*Those who do not see thus know little of him.*

*To observe his body—*
*How much better to observe his spirit?*
*What was his spirit like?*
*It grasped and held the cosmos.*

*Yin ascends, Yang descends—*
*Like the Yellow River and Kunlun.*
*The Perfected One’s subtlety*
*Transcends sight and sound.*

*Spirit and bones each returned to their origin.*
*His disciples prepared his burial,*
*Neither lavish nor austere, but fitting ritual.*
*North of the capital, at the site of Wuhua,*
*A stele marks the place—*
*The Perfected endures forever.*

Recorded by Liu Jun of Daoxing, Perfected Zhenchang of Hunyuan County.
Composed by Wang He, Former Metropolitan Graduate.

Lord’s personal name was Daoning. A native of Baideng in Yunzhong, his family had served for generations as county clerks, known for their integrity and impartiality. From birth, he disliked childish play; whenever he joined other children, he would sit cross-legged in a thatched hut, saying, “I am studying the Dao.” Those who recognized his nature knew he bore the marks of past cultivation.

As he grew, his refined aspirations turned toward the Mystic Gate. Of four brothers, he was the eldest. The county folk urged him to succeed his father’s profession, but he firmly declined. In the renxu year of the Zhenyou era, hearing that Liu Chaitou, a recluse of Hunyuan, had attained the Dao, he took leave of his family and journeyed to the Golden Spring Abbey on Mount Pingfeng, where he became his disciple. His master subjected him to many trials, even sending him to beg for food, yet he followed joyfully, never disdaining the task. Seeing his readiness, the master transmitted to him the subtle essence of the teaching.

Thereafter, he traveled east to the shores of the sea and west through the passes into Guanzhong, lodging at the White Cloud Abbey atop Huashan’s upper peak. When famine struck and corpses lay unburied, his resolve never wavered. Later, he sojourned in Taiyuan and the Divine Empyrean Palace, where a monk of the Abundant Benefit Cloister, virtuous and hospitable, fed him. A sum of 1,200 strings of paper currency was found in the Daoist quarters; Lord Daoning posted notices seeking the owner, but after months no one came forward. He distributed it all to the destitute, keeping nothing for himself.

In the jiaxu year of the Zhenyou era, he took refuge in Zhang Village, dwelling in a cave. By the bingzi year, his homeland had grown somewhat settled, and the local official Feng Lu, hearing of his presence in Bingzhou, welcomed him back to Yunnei. Though he dwelt in a bare cell as if severed from the world, those eager for the Dao thirsted for his instruction, and he emerged in myriad ways to teach them.

Thus, scholars flocked to him in such numbers that their shoulders rubbed and their heels trod upon one another, and those who sought to learn from Lord Daoning grew daily more numerous.

In the spring of the gengchen year, Magistrate Gao Dingbao of Hunyuan, having heard of his reputation, respectfully invited him to come. There were the Dragon Spring, Gold Spring, and Mysterious Origin—all renowned abbeys—where he successively served as abbot, and his efforts in restoring dilapidation and reviving decline were many.

In the autumn of the guiwei year, the Perfected Master Qiu Changchun returned from his audience at court. Lord Daoning, observing the rites of a disciple, drew near to the eastern shores of the Silver Sea. There, with a single glance, the Way was present, and they met as if old friends. When asked of his early practice, he replied with the words, "firewood head." The master nodded and said, "A celestial hermit in mid-heaven." Thereupon, he transmitted secret instructions, bestowed the title Zhenchang, and commanded him to build a retreat in the Western Capital. Before long, he was appointed chief of the Daoist clergy. For a decade, he wandered freely, and not a single lawsuit arose in his court.

After Changchun shed his mortal form, Qinghe succeeded him, and their rapport was especially close. In the spring of the bingshen year, when Minister Qinghe returned from paying homage at the ancestral court, he met Lord Daoning on the southern slopes of ancient Mount Heng. He said to him, "Recently, while traveling in Shaanxi, I received a commission from Marquis Tian Deji to select abbots for all the Daoist palaces and abbeys. Only the Cloud Terrace of Mount Hua, where the land is numinous and the creatures refined, is truly a grotto-heaven of the immortals—none but you are fit to be entrusted with it." Lord Daoning declined twice but was unable to refuse. He dispatched disciples to oversee the work and himself made repeated journeys there, greatly expanding the construction. Wherever he passed, offerings were made in abundance, and men and women gathered like a marketplace.

In the mid-summer of the guimao year, when Marquis Tian renovated the Temple of Mount Hua, he and Chancellor Hu Tianlu jointly signed a document inviting Lord Daoning to Yunying. Upon receiving the summons, he set out that very day. In just three or four years, the work was completed.

In the spring of the bingwu year, an imperial edict was issued to hold a grand jiao offering for all under heaven at the Changchun Abbey in Yanjing. The venerable and virtuous from all directions were summoned, and Lord Daoning was among them. At the time, Perfected Master Li presided over the jiao rites and was greatly pleased to have him there.

In the summer of that year, on the gengshen day of the fifth month, he returned to ancient Mount Heng. Twenty-two days later, on the renwu day, he summoned Prefect Gao Zhongjian and his disciple Xu Zhi’an and entrusted them with his final affairs. The following day, at mid-morning, he bent his arm beneath his head and passed away, having lived seventy-five years.

Lord Daoning was born and raised in Dading during the Mingchang era. He never allowed his heart to be ensnared by the pleasures of the mundane world but instead distanced himself from worldly dust, dwelling beyond material things. Whether traveling east or west, wherever he went, he captivated all. Though he repeatedly oversaw construction projects, he merely responded to circumstances. He once composed *The Song of the Ba People* to guide the multitude and wrote three records—*Meeting the Immortals*, *Following Response*, and *Compendium of Immortals*—to demonstrate that the Way of immortality could be learned.

On his deathbed, he instructed his disciples, saying, "You may place my body in the meditation chamber and simply inscribe the plaque with *Xiuran*." This alluded to the *Nanhua*’s phrase, "stealthily arriving and lightly departing," revealing the cultivation he had nurtured throughout his life.

While in Hunyuan, he delighted in the company of the scholar Wei Gongbangyan. Thus, after his passing, his disciple Shi Zhijing recorded his deeds and traveled to Yanjing to request an inscription from Wei. He also intended to have it carved on a stele beside the memorial hall. One day, Wei brought the request to me, saying, "Zhenchang was a man devoted to the Dao, and I know him well. Yet I am old and have not written for a long time—would you compose something in my stead?"

I was then a stranger in Yanjing, utterly devoid of literary inspiration. Yet, unwilling to refuse the scholar’s earnest request and admiring Zhijing’s loyalty to his master, I named the hall after his final words and here record the events of his life. As for his most outstanding disciples, their names shall be inscribed on the reverse of the stele; I dare not prattle on further.

Recorded on the sixth day before the Qingming Festival in the year of *jiangwei xieqia*.
*Stele Inscription for Master Li Chongxuan of the Double Mystery, Returned to the True*
Composed by Gao Ming, Grand Master for Consultation and Minister of Rites.

In former Jin dynasty custom, the newly enthroned Son of Heaven would routinely appoint imperial princes as regional governors. During the *Da’an* and *Chongqing* reigns, Emperor Xuanzong dispatched Prince Feng to Zhangde. At that time, Master Li, though of modest means, was selected as a *gongcao* official on account of his reputation for integrity and fairness, and particularly for his mastery of military logistics. Thus he came and went within the prince’s residence. His nature was grave and sincere, and he was scrupulously cautious, so he won the prince’s trust and favor.

In the first year of *Zhining*, Emperor Xuanzong ascended the throne. The following year, the imperial carriage traveled to Bianliang, and Master Li accompanied the procession, whereupon he was appointed Clerk of the Ministry of Revenue. Amid those times of hardship, the powerful minister Gao Qi held civil officials in contempt, ruling with the severity of binding wet bamboo. Those who served under him lived in dread, and many gradually withdrew. Yet Master Li, steadfast in his commitment to the upright Way, never wavered in spirit. When dispatched to transport grain to supply the armies in Yan, he reached Bazhou just as northern forces launched a massive invasion, nearly meeting disaster. Yet his deep concern for the world was ever evident in his countenance. Some remarked that rank mattered little—what counted was the strength of one’s conduct. Had he advanced in military service, would not his achievements, fame, and titles have been resplendent?

One day, he suddenly reported illness and retired to Mount Longlü. Those who heard were astonished. There, he encountered Master Lu, a senior disciple of Master Ma of Danyang, and promptly requested to become his disciple in the Quanzhen tradition. After receiving transmission of the lineage’s teachings, he soon experienced a profound inner realization. He entered the Wuyou Cave in Louxia Valley, where he sat in meditation, subsisting on wild plants and drinking from mountain streams. His discipline grew ever more resolute—such were the rigorous practices of one devoted to the Dao, beyond words.

The Prince of Yuan, Weiliang, and the Pacification Commissioner Du Xian—both towering figures of the age—treated him with extraordinary respect. Even amid military encampments and defensive operations, they would lead their subordinates to pay their respects, from which his standing may be inferred. In the year *jiashen*, upon hearing that Master Qiu Changchun had returned from his imperial summons, Master Li accompanied Master Lu over long distances to receive the dharma name *Zhifang* and the sobriquet *Chongxuanzi* ("Master of the Double Mystery").

When Master Lu was appointed to a post in Beijing, he noted that Master Li had long resided in Zhangde and urged him to journey south. The Prefect Zhao Deyong invited him to reside at Yingxiang Abbey. Though the abbey had lain in ruins since the war, with everything in its infancy, Master Li’s mere presence brought a gradual restoration of its former prosperity. In the year *dinghai*, Master Changchun, having ascended to the immortal realm, led his disciples to hold a memorial service. They stayed in Daning and Shun, as if observing a period of mourning. When Master Li returned in *gengyin*, the local gentry and common folk turned out in such numbers to welcome him that the streets were filled. All exclaimed, "Our Master has returned!"

The Commander-in-Chief Xiao Zhongtong and his colleagues submitted a petition requesting him to preside over Tianqing Abbey. The abbey’s desolation was much like Yingxiang Abbey when he first arrived. Yet through his tireless efforts in planning and construction, within a few years it was grandly renovated. Halls, courtyards, altars, scripture repositories, kitchens, and storerooms—even stables and granaries—were all fully restored. Its religious observances surpassed those of any other prefecture or county.

In the year *dingsi*, Prince Muge, deeply admiring his lofty virtue, sent envoys bearing a golden crown, brocade, and feathered robes, resplendent in their brilliance, and bestowed upon him the title of *Zhenren* ("Perfected One"). On the ninth day of the second month in *gengshen*, at the age of seventy-six, he passed away serenely, leaving behind a final hymn. His disciples buried him in a certain field in Wangyu Village, in accordance with his instructions. His writings, including the *Diyuan Jing* in several chapters, circulated in the world.

In the spring of *jiazi*, Zhao Zhipu, the *Tidian* (Supervisor) of the region, along with his dharma brothers, presented a petition, saying: "Our late Master’s spirit has long rested, and the trees on his tomb have grown to the girth of an embrace. Yet no stele commemorates his legacy. We humbly beseech you to bestow an inscription upon us, that we may die without regret." I replied that Master Li’s conduct was indeed worthy of an inscription. From his youth, he was no ordinary man. Though he advanced through civil service, all regarded him as a figure of great promise. Among the retainers of the former prince’s residence, he basked in the radiance of the sun and moon. The bond between ruler and minister was one that ancients called "once in a thousand years"—comparable even to the great ministers of Han. Yet he turned away from all this, embracing austerity, his neck gaunt and his face sallow, abandoning himself to the boundless and unfathomable realm of the Dao, until he attained enlightenment. Who but a man of resolute courage could have done this? For this reason, he is truly worthy of an inscription.

As for the myriad wonders—cranes soaring far from the altar, mantises clinging to ritual vessels until death, tigers obeying writs to hunt boars, snowflakes forming a compass when lost—such marvels were many. Yet these were not things Master Li took pleasure in recounting, nor do I dare record them in full.

Master Li’s courtesy name was *Youzhi*. A native of Anyang in Xiang Prefecture, he was originally named *Yi*. After entering the Dao, he used only his dharma name.

**Inscription:**
Greedy demons wander lost, yet the unshackled remain steadfast.
What was once rare now unfolds before us:
From penal labor and legal codes to household counsel and strategic wisdom,
Before the celestial dragon leapt, he already aligned with the primal yang of the *nine*.
When clouds dispersed and all seemed lost, he followed with unwavering resolve,
Their bond growing ever stronger.
Had he pursued fame and office, he might have become a pillar of his age.
Yet like Song Chang, who declined succession to a marquisate,
Why forsake one path for another?
Truly, he possessed the unyielding strength of a sunken river’s current.
Lightly he journeyed alone, shouldering his burden, forgetting the world.
Swollen and misshapen, he dwelt among neighbors,
In solitude, he found his homeland.
Though the common mocked him, his steadfast conviction burned bright,
His heart vast and luminous.
Who can say what was gained or lost?
Surely some can discern the full measure of his virtue.
Some ride white clouds, others descend to the wilderness,
Yet through a thousand years of night and dawn,
He never strayed from the constant Way of harmony and ease.
This towering stele stands beside his tomb,
Its scrolls unfurled like lotus leaves.
Though woodcutters and shepherd boys may pass,
They will know a man of the Dao does not perish.

**Stele for Master Li, the Perfected One of Serene Reality**
Composed by Wang Bowen, Grand Master for Consultation and Surveillance Commissioner of Hedong and Shanxi.

The Perfected One’s surname was Li, his personal name *Zhiming*, his courtesy name *Yonghui*, and his sobriquet *Qizhen* ("Serene Reality"). His family had long resided in Hu, a village in Guan, where they farmed for generations. His ancestors, though virtuous, remained obscure.

At the tender age of nine, he left his parents to study the Quanzhen teachings. First, he paid homage to Master Pan of Mount Fan as his teacher, reciting scriptures and reading books as a young disciple. As he grew older, he encountered the Perfected One Wang, surnamed Chaoran and titled Guanghua, who transmitted to him the method of *huohou* (fire timing) and the *zhoutian* (celestial circulation), as well as the technique of refining *yin* into *yang*. After long practice, he began to perceive signs of efficacy, and his joy knew no bounds. He exclaimed, "How could my true teacher deceive me?" From then on, he redoubled his daily efforts, ever renewing his dedication. Later, he served the Perfected One Changchun, who bestowed upon him his religious name and courtesy name, cherishing him deeply and instructing him with utmost sincerity.

From the most menial tasks—gathering firewood, drawing water, tending the kitchen and stables—to all labors that taxed body and mind, he was made to experience them firsthand before being guided toward the subtleties of the supreme Dao and shown the methods of diligent practice. His teacher’s exhortations were earnest and repeated, unwearied from dawn to dusk. The Master, too, exerted himself strenuously and endured hardship, often sitting in meditation for over a decade without once reclining. Through stillness, wisdom arose; his nature and understanding became clear and bright. When he took up brush and paper, his spontaneous songs and hymns flowed with reasoned elegance.

Changchun remarked, "This young Li is truly a vessel for the Dao, surpassing all others." Soon after, he took up his staff and gourd and returned directly to Taiyuan, where he renovated the dilapidated Baozhen Abbey and made it his residence. At times, he lodged in bustling markets; at others, he begged for food in village hamlets. Observing the transformations of the world, he passed unrecognized, known only as "Master Li the Daoist."

At that time, the realm was in turmoil, its institutions unsettled. Military encampments dotted the lands of Fen and Jin like scattered stars, and bandits who plundered goods and took lives were everywhere. Yet local officials dared not intervene. In the year *gengyin*, Emperor Taizong marched south, halting his imperial progress at the ancient city of Bing. The Master led his disciples in prostrating themselves before the imperial radiance, offering incense and prayers for longevity. The emperor was pleased and impressed. When he learned of soldiers who had robbed the people, he enforced military law, establishing it as a decree. From then on, travelers moved unmolested, and residents lived in peace—an outcome to which the Master had contributed.

In the year *xinmao*, the emperor again journeyed south, and the Master once more received imperial favor. Thereafter, his reputation in the Dao grew ever more esteemed. When Master Qinghe succeeded to the teachings, he appointed the Master to oversee the affairs of the Daoist communities in the region, concurrently serving as the local Daoist registrar. Later, he was honored with the title *Chongxu Dashi* ("Great Master of Serene Emptiness").

Prefect Shi of Yan Prefecture and Daoist Registrar Zhi, noting the cramped quarters of Baozhen Abbey, petitioned for the Master to take charge of the former Tianqing Palace. After the chaos of war, Tianqing had become a wasteland of brambles and rubble. Once his request was granted, the Master devoted himself wholeheartedly to its restoration and expansion. One day, he addressed his disciples with measured words: "That Daoist priests are charged with maintaining temples is a recent convention. Yet as far back as Emperor Wu of Han, who built a terrace in the Gansui Palace and adorned it with images of heaven, earth, the Great Unity, and various spirits, each with its own sacrificial implements, this practice has grown ever more elaborate over the centuries. Though our Daoist tradition cultivates tranquility and non-action to govern the mind, can we not also regard the bestowal of blessings and the extension of grace as the outward signs of our teaching? Thus, in matters of construction and repair, we must spare no effort."

When some objected that the task was too great, the Master replied, "As the ancients said, 'A house built by the roadside will never be finished in three years if too many opinions are sought.' The decision rests with me." He then took up spade and basket to lead the way. Followers gathered like clouds: the noble oversaw the work, the wealthy contributed funds, the wise offered their skills, and the strong lent their strength. The Master orchestrated the endeavor with divine efficacy, and all responded without fail. Thus, Tianqing Palace was restored to a grandeur and magnificence that made it the finest in the region—a feat recorded in detail in the stele for Wanshou Abbey, composed by the Honorable Song Ronglu. For brevity, those details are omitted here.

In the summer of the year *wuzi*, a great drought threatened the entire region. The prefectural authorities organized a prayer for rain, and the Master was entrusted with conducting the ritual. Soon after, a torrential downpour drenched the land, and the year ended in abundant harvest. Later, the imperial commissioner Wanyan Hushila suddenly fell gravely ill, his breath faint and life nearly extinguished. His family rushed to inform the Master of his perilous state. The Master went to his bedside, recited incantations, and gave him a sip of water—whereupon he revived. Such was the power of his utmost sincerity and the efficacy of his spiritual resonance. Countless such instances occurred in his lifetime, of which only a few are recorded here.

In the year *jiyou*, the Perfected One Zhenchang, recognizing the Master’s steadfast practice and the far-reaching renown of his virtue, promoted him to Deputy Overseer of the Daoist communities in the northern and southern circuits of Hedong. Though he sat motionless in his chamber, making no outward display, every matter was brought to completion. He was deeply respected by Master Chengming of the Zong lineage.

In the second year of the *Zhongtong* era, he was elevated from Deputy to full Overseer. The following year, the Left Immortal Elder Bao submitted a memorial at the Yongning Palace, and the Master was granted the title *Hongmiao Zhenren of Qizhen* ("Perfected One of Vast Mystery and Serene Reality"). Just as he had become an object of veneration for both humans and gods, he suddenly departed this world. In the *bingyin* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, on the morning of the final day of the eleventh lunar month, he returned to the True. He was sixty-seven years old.

The following year, the Master’s senior disciples, Overseer Zhang Zhi and Hou Zhizheng, along with others, petitioned Master Shen Yunsu, the Grand Overseer of Daoism and Perfected One of the Cavernous Mystery, to succeed him in administering Tianqing Palace. Master Shen was the Master’s fellow disciple in the Dao. In the *guiyou* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, while I was serving as an official in Taiyuan, Master Shen returned from the capital. He arranged for the Master’s burial on the *jiyou* day of the fourth lunar month of that year, at a site three *li* southeast of Taiyuan prefectural city, in accordance with the Master’s final instructions.

Master Shen presented me with the *Record of Conduct* compiled by the Master’s disciples, including Guo Zhixiu, and requested a stele inscription. Though Master Shen and I had been friends for twenty years, I initially declined, but he would not accept my refusal. He then asked, "The Master was but a recluse beyond the worldly realm, possessing neither great wealth nor the might of Jin or Chu. Yet through the accumulation of days and months, year after year, he transformed a desolate and forsaken place into a celestial Jade Capital and a jeweled sanctuary on earth—all in the blink of an eye. If not for virtue sufficient to command respect and sincerity capable of moving all things, how could he have achieved this?"

Zhuangzi once said: "If the accumulation of water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat; if the accumulation of wind is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear great wings." Judged by what the Master has accomplished today, can this not be called an accumulation both deep and powerful?

**Inscription:**
Unsullied, wholly preserved—what harm in that?
Unfeigned, wholly true—how enduring it becomes.
This Dao shines bright—who shall uphold it?
When the right man meets the right time,
its currents flow on, and heaven’s light appears.

Such was this man—his blessings profound beyond measure,
his heart serene and luminous, his will steadfast and unyielding.
With inner virtue full-grown, the worth of his Way daily proclaimed,
those who served him vied for his favor like moths to flame,
those who followed him ascended his hall in homespun robes.
His fame spread far, his fragrance lingered long,
a pillar standing firm amid the torrent’s rush,
a lone barrier holding back the flood.

He wandered the Red Waters and found the Dark Pearl,
read the *Southern Florescence* and befriended Zisang.
He saw the life and death of the human world
as but the alternation of day and night, yin and yang.
Then, weary of the world, he ascended as an immortal,
returning to the Emperor’s realm amid white clouds.
Though his bones were shed here,
this was no loss to his true being—
why then be startled by the passing of an ordinary death?

*Record of the Immortal Source of Sweet Waters*, Scroll Six, concludes.

**Stele Inscription for the Virtuous Conduct of the Pure Harmony Perfected of the Radiant Teaching of Supreme Truth**

Composed by Gao Ming, Grand Master for Consultation and Minister of the Ministry of Rites

The Teaching of the Perfect Realization began with the Lesser Yang Lord, flourished with the Double Yang Master, and reached its zenith with the Long Spring Duke. The Long Spring transmitted it to the Pure Harmony, the Pure Harmony to the True Constancy, the True Constancy to the Sincere Illumination, and the Sincere Illumination to the Pure Harmony. Counting by the great reckoning of the Yuan, Pure Harmony was the fifth patriarch of the lineage. His personal name was Zhitan, his courtesy name Gongping, and he hailed from the Wang clan of Xiangzhou’s Tangyin. His father, named Zhong, was of sincere and honest disposition, and his wealth made him prominent in his village. His mother, née Yue, once dreamed during her pregnancy that an ancient immortal came to tell her: “This child, when grown, must be made to study the Dao. Otherwise, he will bring calamity upon your household.” Soon after, the Master was born.

From childhood, he disdained frivolous play and had no fondness for extravagant or coveted things. As soon as he came of age, he donned the robes of a Daoist and became a disciple of Master Lu in the northern capital. Master Lu was a Dharma-grandson of Master Ma of the Vermilion Yang and a senior disciple of Master Yu of the Cavernous Clarity. At the time, he resided in the Huayang Palace in the capital as a Daoist registrar. Master Lu was stern and severe; the slightest offense would provoke his reproach, as if he were an official of the court. Few among his disciples could endure to the end. Yet the Master, in addition to his regular duties, diligently performed every task, even the most menial—cleaning stables, repairing broken steps—without the slightest slackening. Master Lu, moved by his industry and sincerity, treated him with increasing respect.

In the autumn of the *guiwei* year, he paid homage to the Great Patriarch, the Long Spring Perfected, in Xuande. At first sight, the Patriarch esteemed him and transmitted to him secret instructions. Fearing he might not prove worthy of his legacy, the Master then traveled through the Xingzhong region, begging for a single meal each day. Even if his food was infested with worms or spoiled, he would not discard it. He dwelt not in thatched huts but wherever he found himself when dusk fell. In the *wuzi* year, hearing that the Pure Harmony Patriarch was staying in Yan, he knew the succession of the Dao was there and went to pay his respects. The Patriarch, admiring his diligence, greatly praised and promoted him. Suddenly, the Master experienced an awakening, as if his spirit had been illumined, and he instantly regained his original vision.

Soon after, he entered the Golden Slope, where he sat in meditation and refinement, delving into the profound and the obscure. He ate wild plants and drank from mountain streams, and no one saw his face. His resolve grew ever more steadfast and austere. Though he remained secluded for over a decade, all—worthy and unworthy alike—said of him: “The Master of Golden Slope is a man of the Dao.”

In the spring of the *jiachen* year, the True Constancy Perfected, Master Li, who held his mysteries in high regard, repeatedly summoned him by letter and eventually honored him as his Great Vehicle Master. In the fifth month of summer, he followed True Constancy north, where he received the secret registers of the Three Caverns, enabling him to perform prayers, exorcisms, and prohibitions for the salvation of others. Those afflicted with illnesses that could not be cured by medicine or stone would be healed instantly by his talismanic water or the sweep of his sleeve. All stood in awe of his divine power.

The August Empress Dowager, who revered the true wind of the Dao, bestowed upon him the highest honors. Yet the Master grew ever more humble, fearing only carelessness and error. Whenever he received imperial consolation, he attributed all merit to the sagely and divine, as if he dared not claim any for himself. Such was his understanding of the root and his refusal to boast.

He remained at the imperial court for six years before returning to Yan to serve as the Teaching’s Chief Supervisor. Yan lay over sixteen hundred *li* from Helin, yet he made the journey seventeen times, braving heat and cold without the slightest sign of hardship. For he took the support of the Mysterious Teaching as his own duty, and even death would not have made him regret it.

In the first year of the enthronement of the former emperor, the year *xinhai*, the True Constancy Duke was commanded to carry the golden tally and travel posthaste to perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai. The Master was appointed to assist him. Later, he was sent four more times to offer incense and conduct the sacrifices, each time with the intent of entreating Heaven for the Mandate, gathering blessings, and bestowing them upon the people.

In the *guichou* year, the emperor inquired about the arts of nurturing life. The Master replied: “These are fitting for recluses in mountain forests and beneath withered bridges, not for the urgent concerns of the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven acts as Heaven’s deputy in ordering the world. He should follow the will of Heaven, benefit the people, and then Heaven will bestow upon him blessings and longevity. Recently, a great amnesty was proclaimed throughout the realm, and the old was reformed into the new. The people rejoice in their livelihoods. Yet since the opening of the passes, countless souls have perished violently at Heaven’s Gate, their spirits left without refuge. None can save them except by seeking aid in the unseen. Thus, the emperor’s grace has reached the eight directions, and his beneficence has even penetrated the Nine Springs.”

He then memorialized the emperor to perform the Yellow Register Grand Offering for All Under Heaven. The emperor rejoiced, saying: “Heaven has bestowed this teaching to benefit the world.” He immediately commanded the Master and the True Constancy Duke to prepare the offering at the Long Spring Palace in Yan. All necessary provisions were drawn from the imperial treasury, without the slightest imposition on the people’s livelihoods.

On the fifteenth day of the third month of the *jiayin* year, as the rites were about to commence, clouds gathered and rain threatened. The Master secretly prayed to Heaven, and the skies stilled. The wind and moon grew solemn, the stars seemed within reach, and auspicious omens—auspicious clouds, simurghs, and cranes—appeared. Ministers, scholars, and officials all composed poems and songs to praise these portents. From that time, the esteem for the Dao grew even greater. All the noble and eminent hastened to serve him, some even taking the disciple’s bow.

When True Constancy passed away, Sincere Illumination succeeded him, and the Master’s efforts were instrumental in this. In the spring of the first year of the Zhongtong era, he entered Guanzhong, then traveled to Tanhuai, where he climbed the Heavenly Altar of Lu. He grew fond of the place and remained at Jade Peak for the year.

The Divine Empyrean Palace in Xiangzhou had long lacked a master of the Mysteries. The elders and common people earnestly entreated the Master to take the position. The following year, he attended the burial of True Constancy. The year after, he returned to Golden Slope.

In the first year of the Zhiyuan era, a man of Yan named Yang, a supervisor, had long admired the Mysterious Teaching. In the garden behind his private residence, he built a hermitage and wished to invite a lofty and pure practitioner to reside there. It was said: “The Refiner Master Wang of Golden Slope may be fittingly invited.” In the winter of the third year, Sincere Illumination again entreated the Master to take up the position of supervisor.

In the seventh year, Sincere Illumination ascended as an immortal. The present emperor commanded the Master to succeed him and further bestowed upon him the title of Perfected. On the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month of the ninth year, he shed his form in the Dark Hall of Long Spring, having attained the age of seventy-three.

The following year, his disciples Liang Zhi’an, Chang Zhimin, and others, in accordance with his final instructions, enshrined his robes and cap beneath Golden Slope Mountain.

At that time, the weather was biting cold. Yet when the funeral rites were underway, it suddenly turned mild as spring. Over ten thousand people, staff and whisk in hand, stood in attendance, their backs drenched in sweat. All marveled at the wonder, declaring it proof of his perfect sincerity. His works, *Record of Unwavering Faith* and *The Six Oxen Diagram*, were transmitted to the world.

The following year after his burial, his disciples Liang Zhi’an, Chang Zhimin, and others presented an account of the Master’s conduct, seeking an inscription. When I, Wu Zhi, served as prefect of Zhangde, I had once submitted a memorial requesting the Master to preside over the Divine Empyrean Abbey, and our association was most cordial. Thus, I could not refuse this duty out of principle.

The Master possessed a noble bearing and loved reading, particularly delighting in the learning of nature and principle, deeply grasping its profound meaning. He was generous to those in distress or hardship, regardless of his own circumstances. Humble, magnanimous, self-disciplined, and deferential to others, he guided thousands of disciples. The monasteries and hermitages he established numbered over a hundred—truly one who greatly propagated the Dao.

Alas! Had the Master’s lifelong devotion to aiding others through hidden merits been applied in court, granted the authority to govern and enact the Dao, who knows but that his achievements might have rivaled those of his talismanic rituals and altar rites? When he was about to journey to the eastern regions of Liao, prayers for him cured his wind-induced paralysis. Later, when he departed Xuchang, a command from the Jade Emperor was transmitted through the void. Such marvels were many, yet they were not the essence of his being. Moreover, the *Biography of the Pure and Harmonious Perfected* already exists, so I omit them here.

**Inscription:**
When Chaos perished, the Great Dao grew obscure,
Some muddied its purity, others sullied its clarity.
They reviled with form, raged with emotion,
Prized jade disks above four-horse chariots,
And boasted of theft as glory.

Then Heaven sent forth the Sage,
A medicine for the deaf and blind.
He wrote two scrolls, forced them into names.
There was one from Qiyuan,
Who expounded the Kun and Peng,
Dreamed of butterflies and attained empty whiteness.
Thus Chaos revived, the Great Dao shone again.
Generation after generation, men arose,
And the mystic wind daily flourished.

Then came Chongyang,
Peerless in his time.
Who could resemble him?
The Pure and Harmonious was his heir.
Upright in resolve, serene in heart,
He dwelled in stillness like a pagoda,
Yet his renown shook the world.
Silent, without sound,
Detached, without scheming,
He soared alone, ethereal and free.

A central pillar, unshaken through ten thousand ages,
He upheld the mystic net,
And the Master presided over its covenant.
Though he saved the world under the guise of talismanic waters,
Even crows and lambs revered him like an elder.

Golden Slope stands verdant,
Its grasses and trees radiant.
Here lie his robes and cap,
His merits and deeds inscribed.
Yet his essence has returned—
Perhaps he rides the tinkling wind,
Guides the luminous qi,
And sports on Yuan Isle or the Crimson City.

**Epitaph for the Transcendence of Perfected Master Mao, Nourisher of the True and Void**
Composed by Li Guowei, Director of Schools for the Henan Prefecture Route

Between Heaven and Earth, nothing is greater than life and death. From birth to death, the sum of good and evil is revealed. Yet even Heaven, so lofty, and Earth, so vast, suffer eclipses of sun and moon, collapses of mountains and rivers. If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure forever, how much less can man? Thus we know life is not eternal—only stillness and the return to destiny are constant. Those who do not forget in death attain longevity, for the Dao abides therein.

After the Great Dao faded, human desires flourished unchecked, beyond remedy. Fortunately, from Zhongli Quan onward, and especially with the rise of the Quanzhen teachings in recent times, Wang Chongyang emerged. He transformed Ma, Tan, Qiu, and Liu by the sea, journeying between the eastern and western capitals. His immortal traces became manifest, and from near and far, people turned to his influence. As his teachings spread, they filled the four directions. Those who entered his gate numbered tens of thousands, yet few truly grasped the principles of nature and destiny, understood the matters of life and death, and did not lose their way.

Over the past century, those who could inherit the legacy of Chongyang’s Seven Perfected, and who in this age stand among the loftiest Daoists, moving and transforming the Guanzhong and Luoyang regions, admired by all and uniquely distinguished, was the Void-Nourishing Perfected Master Mao.

The Master’s personal name was Yangsu, his courtesy name Shouzhi, and his Daoist name Chunsuzi. "Perfected Nourisher of the True and Void" was his honorific title. Born into the Pingshui Mao family, he was the direct grandson of Mao Hudamu, Grand Master of Remonstrance and concurrent Secretariat Drafter, as well as Prefect of Qinzhou. Hudamu, renowned for his pure conduct and literary refinement, was specially summoned by the court in the early Mingchang era of the former Jin dynasty to serve as Palace Instructor. His teachings benefited all, from high to low. Having served in the Hanlin Academy and as prefect of external commanderies, he never deviated from the Dao. It is no wonder Heaven blessed him with worthy descendants.

The Master’s father, named De, courtesy name Rixin, entered officialdom through hereditary privilege but disdained hasty advancement. The Master’s nature was tranquil and detached, with an innate aspiration to transcend the mundane. Having lost his mother in childhood, he served his father with utmost reverence, earning the praise of his village as a paragon of filial piety.

Having come of age, he sojourned in Xuchang. In the early years of the Zhenyou era, a feathered guest once visited him—his bearing was refined and untrammeled. At first sight, the Master knew him to be an extraordinary man and reverently attended him for a long time. The guest said, “This youth is teachable,” and imparted to him secret words. When the Master asked his Daoist name, he replied, “I am Chen Tixu of Mount Hua.” With that, he suddenly vanished. From then on, the Master’s heart and spirit were liberated, and the verdure of the Dao grew ever deeper within him. He also sought instruction from the reclusive gentlemen Yu Song and Er Lao, often receiving their teachings, learning to cultivate humility in himself and engage with others through sincere virtue.

After his father passed away and the mourning rites were completed, he abandoned his home, changed into Daoist robes, and journeyed to pay homage to Tian Wu’ai, the Perfected One of Radiant Wisdom on Mount Taihua, who was a Dharma successor of [Wang] Chongyang. He served with utmost reverence, bearing the few and staff, enduring hardship in the mysterious gate for nearly twenty years. Tian Wu’ai marveled at him, and the secret talismans and oral instructions of the cinnabar script were transmitted to him in turn. His celestial radiance shone forth, growing ever brighter each day, nearly impossible to conceal.

Yet his aspiration lay in the four directions, unconfined by worldly attachments. His disciple Chang Zhijiu, descended from a long line of officials, was then serving as supervisor of Yongning Office; he abandoned his post to enter the Dao and, along with other esteemed companions, invited the Master to reside at Fengyi Abbey. One day, the Master’s son came in search of him. Upon meeting, the son pleaded tearfully for his return, but the Master refused, saying, “Having entered the Daoist gate, my comings and goings follow their own time. I cannot be burdened by worldly ties—do not concern yourself with me.” His son wept and departed.

Later, during the upheaval of the Tianxing era in Henan, when the imperial court’s armies crossed south, the Master returned to Gufen. At that time, officials, Daoists, and laypeople alike petitioned earnestly, and together with his Dharma associates Wang, Ye, and others, as well as Party Zichun of Qixia, he was invited to preside over Xuandu Abbey. When locusts swarmed the land in Jin territory, causing the people great distress, the Master, along with Wang, Ye, and their companions, fasted and prayed fervently. The locusts all took flight and did no harm, and the people marveled at this manifest response, attributing it to his profound sincerity. All held him in deep reverence.

Yet even in such a blessed sanctuary, he could not entirely forget his attachments. In the year *yiwei*, together with his disciples, including Chang Zhijiu, he traveled south from Shaanxi, renovating Chaoyuan and Qixia Abbeys in Luoyang, as well as Qinghua Abbey in Huayin. Within a few years, their splendor in gold and jade surpassed all others. In *dingyou*, the officials of Ruzhou petitioned him to reside at Beiji Abbey. In *jihai*, when famine struck the Guanzhong and Luoyang regions and the wealthy hoarded their grain, the Master distributed all his surplus stores to relieve the suffering, saving countless lives. Such was his lifelong joy in aiding the distressed, taking benevolence as his personal duty.

In *xinchou*, the Perfected One of Pure Harmony arrived at Zhongnan, and recognizing the Master’s long-cultivated virtue and towering reputation, appointed him as Supervisor of Qixia Abbey, concurrently overseeing the Eight Trigrams Bureau of Piyun, Xuandu, and Baozang. At that time, Yang, the Prefect of Ziyang, was serving as Transport Commissioner, along with Wang Yuanli of Yuhua and Yang Xiangzhengqing of Xi’an—all were in Luoyang and befriended him, their bond deepening with time. His reputation in the Dao grew ever more illustrious, casting a radiant light upon the era.

In *jiachen*, the Vice-Supervisor, the Great Master Haoshi Ming, was summoned north by imperial decree of the Empress Dowager, receiving the title *Master of Serene Emptiness*. Later, the True Constancy Grand Master and Patriarch was dispatched south, bestowing upon him the title *Perfected One of Nurturing Truth and Serene Emptiness*. After performing the rites at the sacred abbey, he assumed the seat of the master, his demeanor in teaching and precepts ever solemn, never slackening.

In *gengxu*, he recommended Han, the Daoist Registrar of the Northern Capital, to succeed him and retired to Qinghua Abbey. Before long, Han returned to the capital and passed away, and at the behest of the Dharma decree of the True Constancy and Illuminating Perfected One, he once again took charge of Chaoyuan and Qixia Abbeys.

The Master devoted his life to the study of principle and nature, never ceasing for even a moment. Thus, he attained profound penetration and integration, upholding the true lineage of the Quanzhen tradition—his cultivation was indeed deep. One day, as he sat solemnly before the incense burner, he spoke words of his impending departure, leaving all bewildered. The next morning, after completing his toilette, he stood upright against the wall and passed away in perfect composure, his countenance unchanged. That day, rosy clouds stretched across the sky, and some witnessed the Master soaring above them. The scholars Yang Jun of Yichuan and Han Zhongwen of Dengfeng, who had lodged at the abbey, marveled at the sight. It was the fourth day of the seventh month in the year *jiwei*, and he had lived eighty-two years. Throughout his life, he gathered disciples and propagated the teachings, initiating over a hundred followers into the gate of the Dao. His remains were interred in the ancestral burial ground of the abbey.

Many among the Guanzhong and Luoyang gentry composed biographies, poems, and elegies for him, and a *Floating Rosy Clouds* scroll painting was passed down through the world. The Hanlin Academician Meng Panlin and the Capital Professor Li Ting recorded his life in great detail. His disciples Wang Zhichong, Zhang Zhiquan, and his fellow Daoist Pan Chang Zhijiu, along with the lecturer Guo Congdao, compiled an account of his deeds and entreated me to compose this inscription, a request I could not refuse.

I reflect: how profound is the difficulty of illuminating the Dao! Its attainment or failure depends on whether one awakens to it. Thus, the ancient sages spoke of the “subtlety of the Daoist heart” and declared, “To hear the Dao in the morning and die in the evening is enough.” They did not regard the attainment of the Dao as easy. For those who awaken and succeed, there must be a cause. Surely, they are endowed with lofty brilliance, encounter the numinous and extraordinary, hold fast to spirit and guard unity with steadfastness, and accumulate merit through diligent practice. From the first spark of true essence, they cultivate with unwavering effort from beginning to end—only then may they hope to enter its realm.

The Master was born in Gufen, raised in a family of virtuous ancestors and accumulated blessings, receiving the harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth—his endowment needs no discussion. In his seclusion at Xuxia, he encountered Chen Tixu, who deemed him teachable and transmitted to him the wondrous Dao. He entered Mount Taihua to pay homage to Tian Wu’ai and received the cinnabar script—his encounters were indeed extraordinary. Within, he upheld filial reverence in serving his parents and Heaven; without, he extended compassion and benevolence to people and all beings. Was this not the accumulation of meritorious deeds?

He dwelt in seclusion beneath Mount Hua and along the banks of the Luo, embracing purity, emptiness, and stillness for forty years—ever advancing, never retreating. Was this not the steadfastness of one who holds fast to the spirit and guards the One? Thus, in the end, he achieved success, breaking free from the snares of the mundane world and transcending the mechanisms of transformation, moving with effortless grace into the realm of boundless freedom and ease. Was this not fitting?

Later scholars ought to emulate his example and take it to heart.

Moreover, from the time the Great Dynasty came to possess all under Heaven, through the reign era of Zhongtong, to the present as the August Heaven-favored Emperor, along with the Empress, the Crown Prince, and the various princes, all have revered and upheld the subtle Daoist winds, honoring and venerating lofty scholars. That the Master’s return to the highest good should be thus—how could it not be commemorated with an inscription?

**Inscription:**
In the time of Great Antiquity, at the dawn of human life,
Men lived long without premature death, benevolent without baseness.
When the Great Dao faded into obscurity,
Decadent customs spread unchecked,
Human desires flourished,
And Heavenly principle was nearly extinguished.
Light-minded in likes and dislikes,
Wearied by the clamor of sights and sounds,
How few found their way back to true essence!

Amidst the pure currents,
There was one of unadorned simplicity,
Who forgot fame and profit,
Withdrew from court and marketplace,
Nurtured his *qi* amidst mist and clouds,
And made his home among mountains and rivers.
By the Yi and Luo rivers,
Beneath Mount Song and Mount Hua,
He sought like-minded companions,
Secretly knocking at the gate of the mysterious.
Amidst the tumult of the age,
He wandered freely in their midst.

Amidst such purity, he encountered lofty transcendents,
Joined their carefree chariots in ascent,
Received secret formulas,
And forged the Great Elixir.
He repaid the debt to those who fed and clothed him,
Rescuing the age from peril and hardship.

Inwardly he cultivated, outwardly he refined,
His merit perfected, his conduct complete.
His name inscribed in the Purple Palace,
His example left for the yellow-crowned.
As the dust of the world faded away,
The wind-borne carriage would soon return.
Illusory body and external things,
He regarded as mere trifles,
Floating on rosy clouds through the void,
Gazing down upon the mortal realm.

His traces remain on stone,
For those with aspiration to clearly engrave.
To begin well and end well—
This is what the multitude finds difficult.
He neither descended to the earthly realm
Nor was enrolled among the celestial bureaus.
Life and death brought no change to himself,
How much less the ends of profit and harm?
Was he not near to the ranks of immortals?
Later generations look up to him,
Brushing the stone to behold.

*The Stele Inscription of Master Lǐ the Perfected of Perfect Illumination of Mount Zhongnan*

Composed by Lǐ Dàoqiān, the Daoist of Celestial Joy of the Ancestral Court

The Master’s surname was Lǐ, his given name Zhìyuán, a native of Sanshui County in Dengzhou. Endowed by Heaven with a profound nature, his clan praised him for filial piety and brotherly respect. From youth, he harbored the aspiration to ascend aloft. Before reaching thirty, both his parents passed away. Thereupon, he abandoned his home, severed all ties, purified himself, and entered the Dao, becoming a disciple of Quán Yángzhōu Jūn of Yùfēng Abbey in his native prefecture. For years, he served diligently without slack.

Quán Yáng, moved by his sincerity, transmitted to him the subtle principles of cultivating the true, and further instructed him to travel among the various regions to verify the mind-seal. Arriving at Lǐquán, he built a thatched hut with his like-minded companion, Master Péi, where he cast off desires, concentrated his spirit, and emptied his mind to gather the Dao. After eighteen years, worldly cares dissolved entirely, and the light of Heaven shone forth from within.

A fellow townsman, Master Lǐ, revered his lofty purity and, having built a Daoist shrine, led the elders of the village to invite him, treating him with the rites due a master. Before long, Quán Yáng summoned him back to the abbey, bestowed upon him the title *Yuánmíngzǐ*, and entrusted him with the administration of Yùfēng Abbey. Once, gathering his disciples, he declared: *"Yuánmíng has truly attained the Dao. After my return to the All, you shall honor him as your master."* In the winter of the *wùzǐ* year of the Zhèngdà era (1248), Quán Yáng returned to the True, and the assembly, following his earlier command, installed Master Liàn in the master’s seat. Master Liàn reluctantly accepted.

Shortly thereafter, he relocated to the Temple of Emperor Gaozu of Han west of the capital city of Jingzhào Prefecture. He educated his younger brothers, nephews, and disciples with impartial generosity, and all Daoist followers near and far held him in reverent awe, affirming that Quán Yáng’s transmission had found its rightful heir.

At the beginning of the Tiānxīng era, when the Qín region was beset by war, Master Liàn led his followers out of the pass and took refuge on Jīzú Mountain in Shàn Prefecture, later moving to Chángshēng Abbey in Luòyáng. When Hénán fell, the imperial court dispatched envoys to summon the three teachings. Master Liàn led his followers north across the river and settled in Bǐngzhēn Abbey in Dōng’ē County. Far and near, those who heard of his weighty virtue and sought his instruction were beyond count.

Master Fàn, the *Yīxuán Tōngzǐ*, who oversaw Daoist affairs in Shāndōng, treated him as an elder brother, frequently sending messengers to inquire after his well-being and provide for his needs. In the *jiǎwǔ* year (1234), when the Guān-Fǔ region was pacified, Master Liàn recalled the Huó Sǐrén Mù in Nánshí Village on Mount Zhōngnán—the place where Ancestor Chóngyáng had refined the true. Formerly, Quán Yáng had wished to restore the dwelling to manifest the immortal’s traces, but the chaos of the Jīn dynasty’s end prevented its construction. Master Liàn then dispatched his disciple Wáng Zhìruì and others to return west and reclaim the land.

In the *yǐwèi* year (1235), Qí Dànián, a military aide and old acquaintance from Master Liàn’s hometown, then residing in Zhàozhōu, admired his virtue and built Wùzhēn Hermitage, inviting him to reside there. All necessities were provided without interruption. In the winter of the *bīngshēn* year (1236), he journeyed to Yàn, where he paid respects at Chùshùn Hall. The Preceptor of the Teaching, Qīnghé Zōngshī, received him with exceptional courtesy, appointing him Supervisor of the Daoist Clergy of Zhēndìng Circuit, saying: *"When I recently visited Cháng’ān to offer incense at the ancestral court, I saw that you had sent people to restore the sacred site at Nánshí. I have named it Chóngyáng Chéngdào Abbey. Yet this is no trivial matter. If you do not personally oversee it, I fear it cannot be accomplished."* Upon Master Liàn’s return to Zhào, he subsequently sent his dharma-brother Wú Zhìdàn to serve as abbey supervisor.

In the winter of the *wùxū* year (1238), Tián Déróng, the Military Commissioner of Jingzhào, dispatched an official with a petition to summon Master Liàn. That very day, he set out with a hundred followers, returning west to commence construction on a grand scale. From then on, the Daoist affinity flourished, disciples gathered in throngs, and within a few years, the halls and pavilions stood magnificent, rivaling Zōngshèng, Shàngqīng, and Yùxiān Abbeys.

In the spring of the *xīnchǒu* year (1241), during the ancestral court’s collective burial rites, thousands of Daoist followers and the Preceptor of the Dòngzhēn Tradition elevated Master Liàn to the position of Supervisor of Chóngyáng Abbey. Master Liàn, through the Dao of rectifying himself to rectify others, aided in the transformation of the mysterious, contributing his strength.

On the first day of the eighth month of the *bǐngwǔ* year (1246), after completing his morning audience, he suddenly addressed his assembly: *"Yesterday, I received a revelation from the mysterious: I cannot long remain in this world. Each of you must devote yourselves to cultivation. Now that this sacred site of our ancestral master has been realized—fulfilling the aspiration of my late master—I may depart without regret. Maintain it well, lest it falter midway."* Thereupon, he ceased taking grain and fell silent. Five days later, he bathed, changed his clothes, and peacefully passed away, aged seventy-one. His disciples interred him in the Immortals’ Cemetery northeast of the abbey.

In the winter of the *gēngxū* year (1250), the Preceptor of the Teaching, Zhēncháng Zhēnrén, by imperial command, conferred honorific titles upon accomplished Daoist masters. By grace, Master Liàn was posthumously bestowed the title *Yuān Xū Yuán Péng Zhēnrén*, and the abbey was elevated to the status of a palace.

Alas, how magnificent! Master Liàn’s demeanor was solemn and weighty, his nature humble and unassuming. He disciplined himself and accommodated others, valued righteousness over wealth. Though he never studied books, all his seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting accorded with the classics’ principles. Even amidst the most pressing affairs, his cultivation never waned for a moment. In his chamber, only a towel, basin, table, and staff remained—no superfluous possessions. Beyond a single cap and robe, he kept no trunks or chests. He sat in solitude all day, seemingly oblivious to the world. Yet when approached, his harmonious influence nourished others, enabling them to find their own attainment.

Master Liàn’s instruction of his disciples was ever attuned to their individual capacities, each awakening to their own potential. His teachings invariably centered on nurturing the spirit, cultivating qi, sincerity of intention, and rectification of the mind. Even when encountering the most ignorant or misguided among the young, he never resorted to harsh reprimand. Instead, he employed the karmic consequences of good and evil as expedient means to guide them, ensuring their hearts were moved to shame and submission, thus gently shaping their transformation. Such was the measure of his accomplishment in others.

In the autumn of the *gui-you* year of the Zhiyuan era, on the Double Ninth Festival, *Tidian* Wu Zhida often reflected upon the profound influence of Master Liàn’s nurturing guidance, his gratitude enduring. He entreated me to compose an inscription to be engraved upon unyielding stone, that his legacy might endure for eternity. Having dwelt alongside Master Liàn in the immortal realm for nearly a decade, I too revered his lofty character and delighted in extolling his great virtue. Thus, I append this eulogy:

**Eulogy:**
The Dao of True Constancy,
Knows neither gate nor chamber.
Who then first revealed it?
The Patriarch of Chongyang.

Eastward to the sea he journeyed,
Four disciples spread his fragrance.
Branches diverged, yet all flourished,
Transforming myriad regions.

The Radiant Elder Immortal,
Heaven-endowed with Dao and power,
Descendant of Danyang’s lineage,
True heir of Quanyang.

Long he advanced in true cultivation,
His merit complete, his virtue perfected.
Whether in retreat or engagement,
He embodied Dao and righteousness.

The immortal retinue arrived from the west,
Eager to build in the southern era.
Disciples thronged in abundance,
Teachings spread in harmonious splendor.

The towering abbey rose,
Gilded and resplendent in its grandeur,
First established as a sacred sanctuary,
A foundation for ten thousand generations.

Beginning well and ending nobly,
He bent his arm for a pillow, gathering his breath.
Though form is subject to birth and transformation,
The Dao knows no end.

My eulogy, in these words,
Holds no falsehood to truth.
Engraved upon the jade palace’s stone,
May later generations take it as their model.

*Record of the Conduct of the Great Master of Pure Emptiness, Ba Jun*
Composed by Chen Chuwang, Hanlin Academician, Reader-in-Waiting, Grand Master for Proper Consultation, and concurrently Libationer of the Directorate of Education

The state venerates the Three Teachings, of which Daoism is one. Those who uphold the teachings reflect upon the generosity of imperial favor, and their gratitude in repaying the throne ensures an unending bond with the state. Thus, Daoist lineages invariably establish abbeys and palaces, gathering disciples to venerate the Mysterious and Vast, offering morning and evening devotions as places to pray for the emperor’s mandate and the nation’s fortune. This embodies the ancient intent of repaying the throne’s benevolence from below, and it is the very purpose for which the Hall of Universal Illumination was built.

The principles of the world are such that clarity arises from unimpeded flow. The human mind is inherently empty, luminous, and penetrating. Yet once obscured by external things, its brightness is obstructed, and obstruction leads to profound darkness. Clarity must arise from unimpeded flow—without flow, there can be no clarity. This is the meaning of "universal illumination," which the Great Master of Pure Emptiness, Ba Jun, inscribed upon his heart and bestowed as the name of his hall.

His personal name was Dexin, styled Zhongzhi, and his family hailed from Tang County. From childhood, he was studious and devoted to his parents, earning renown for his filial piety. His learning was vast, yet he regarded the Laozi’s principle of emptying the heart to embody the Dao as the gateway to true attainment. During the *Zhenyou* era’s southward migration, he relocated his family to Xiangling for over a decade, during which both his parents passed away in succession. After observing the full mourning period, he resolved to seek extraordinary masters. Leaving his hometown, he journeyed south to Meng Mountain, where he received the Dao from the Venerable Wuchen, Master Wei.

Wuchen held him in high esteem and bestowed upon him his present name and style. Thereafter, he donned the yellow cap and rustic robes, wandering wherever inclination led him. In his later years, he settled in Qingzhou, dwelling in reclusion at the Abbey of Great Emptiness. Previously, a fellow disciple, the eminent scholar Wang Jun, had selected a site for an abbey in the southeastern corner of the prefectural city, intending to house wandering Daoists. Twenty *li* east of the city, he purchased fields and gardens to provide for incense and offerings. One day, he encountered Zhongzhi, and finding their aspirations aligned, he entrusted the entire property to him, declaring, "You are the one who will fulfill my vision."

Zhongzhi personally led the Daoist community, zealously undertaking construction. At that time, *Zongguan* Lord Yu, *Yuanshuai* Lord Jiang, and numerous devotees from all directions generously contributed to the noble endeavor. They erected the main hall of Universal Illumination, installed the august image of the Jade Emperor, and built the abbot’s quarters, cloud hall, refectory, storehouses, corridors, and auxiliary chambers in orderly succession, creating a magnificent new spectacle.

Upon completion, on every first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, officials from the *Zongguan* downward came to burn incense and pay homage, offering prayers for the emperor’s longevity. This act of repaying the throne’s benevolence ensured no betrayal of the original intent behind the state’s veneration of Daoism—such was Zhongzhi’s fundamental aspiration.

The Grand Master and Keeper of the Daoist Teachings, the Perfected of True Constancy, named the abbey *Tongxuan* and bestowed upon him a golden plaque and purple robe, conferring the title *Qingxu* (Pure Emptiness). The Grand Master and Perfected of Sincerity and Clarity further appointed him Daoist Registrar of the Yidu Circuit.

In the *yi-hai* year, the court dispatched an envoy to summon him, detaining him at the Abbey of Everlasting Spring. On every matter, he was consulted, and by special decree, he was promoted to *Tiju* of the Daoist Teachings in all circuits, in recognition of his virtue.

In former times, Sima Ziwei of Henei received the Orthodox Unity teachings from Pan Jun of Mount Song’s Body of Mystery, who in turn received them from Wang Jun of Maoshan’s Ascension of Mystery, who received them from Tao Jun, the Recluse of Huayang. From Tao Jun to Ziwei spanned four generations, and during the *Jingyun* era of the Tang, Ziwei was summoned to court, where he admonished Emperor Ruizong with the analogy of governing the state as one governs the body.

From the Patriarch of Danyang, this Dao was transmitted to Song Yuanyuan, who passed it to Wei Wuchen, who in turn transmitted it to Zhongzhi—likewise four generations. Now, Zhongzhi, honored for his virtue, has received the imperial summons. In the future, when he presents his counsel, he will surely expound upon the learning of rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention, revealing the principles of opening things and accomplishing tasks to enlighten the sagely heart. His words will echo Ziwei’s analogy of governing the state and the body, though separated by eras, their resonance remains the same.

Zhongzhi is a Daoist in name yet Confucian in conduct. I have known him the longest and am well acquainted with the broad strokes of his life’s journey. I record these details to leave for those who will inherit the teachings, that they may understand.

Recorded on an auspicious day in the first month of the *geng-chen* year of the Zhiyuan era.
*Stele of the Conduct of the Perfected of Shared Dust, Master Li, of the Abbey of Ancestral Sagacity on Mount Zhongnan*

Composed by Li Daoqian, the Heavenly Music Perfected, Preceptor of Daoist Affairs for the Five Routes of Shaanxi and the Four Circuits of Western Shu and Sichuan

Our Master bore the surname Li, with the personal name Zhirou and the courtesy name Qianshu. His ancestors hailed from the Luo River region, where they tilled the soil and tended mulberry trees, their family esteemed for its purity and integrity among the villagers. He was the second of four brothers.

From birth, he possessed innate wisdom. As he matured, he developed a profound love for forests and springs, his spirit untouched by worldly dust. His father, Zhiwei, had long been devoted to the study of the mysterious, having first received the teachings of the Quanzhen school from Master Li, the Perfected of Opening the Mysteries—a senior disciple of the Great Ancient of Lincheng in Zhaozhou. Upon completing his studies, Zhiwei’s conduct and compositions, particularly his songs and poems, resonated deeply with the profound principles of the Dao.

In the *xin-you* year of the Taihe era, our Master also became a disciple of the Perfected of Opening the Mysteries, observing the rites of a student and serving with diligence for many years. Recognizing his capacity to receive the Dao, the Perfected entrusted him with the secret essentials of the true transmission, concealing nothing. Once affirmed, our Master devoted himself to refining his mind and nurturing his nature. Though he wandered as a mendicant between Xing and Ci, enduring days without food, his resolve never wavered. He later retreated to the mountains of Xianxi and Guangyang, severing all worldly ties for twelve years. There, he delved deeply into the study of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny, attaining profound realization.

By this time, both the Perfected of Opening the Mysteries and his father, Zhiwei, had ascended as immortals. His elder brother, Zhiduan, and younger brothers, Zhizang and Zhiyong, all followed him in his pursuits, their bond rooted in the shared pursuit of the Dao. Later, when bandits arose in the western mountains, he relocated to Xingtai, where he established the Tongzhen Abbey as his residence. His reputation grew, and from near and far, seekers flocked to become his disciples, their sandals filling the thresholds.

In the spring of the *geng-chen* year, hearing that Master Changchun, the Venerable Patriarch, had risen to prominence in the coastal regions and was passing through Yan and Zhao, our Master received him with due ceremony. By the eighth month of the *gui-wei* year, when Changchun received the imperial summons to journey south, our Master once again met him at the Chaoyuan Abbey in Xuande. Recognizing his profound virtue and long-standing renown, Changchun bestowed upon him the title *Tongchenzi* ("Perfected of Shared Dust") and charged him with establishing abbeys, ordaining disciples, and tending to the needs of traveling Daoists. Our Master faithfully adhered to these sacred instructions, founding the Changchun Abbey in Zhangchuan, the Fengtian Abbey in Daming, and the Qizhen Abbey.

In the *bing-xu* year, he journeyed to Yan to pay homage at the Baoxuan Hall, seeking verification of the mind-seal. The following autumn, when Changchun returned to the true, our Master took up his staff and sandals to return south. His followers multiplied, and in rapid succession, he established abbeys such as the Shenxiao in Cizhou, the Qingxu in Xiangzhou, the Tianping in Linlü, the Datong in Guangzong, and the Dongzhen in the capital. His disciples across the land erected over two hundred hermitages and abbeys, both grand and modest, and the number of Daoists he transformed and guided was commensurate.

In the *bing-shen* year, the Pure Harmony Patriarch traveled from Yan to Qin, restoring the ancestral sanctuaries of Liu and Jiang on Mount Zhongnan. Our Master accompanied him on this journey. At that time, the Daoist Zhang Zhijian of the Zongsheng Abbey at Louguan, custodian of the sacred site where the Primordial Daoist Ancestor had expounded the two *Daode jing* scriptures, reported that the abbey had been reduced to ruins during the warfare of the Tianxing era. He entreated the Patriarch to devise a plan for its reconstruction. The Patriarch replied, "Without the cinnabar mountain, how can the resplendent phoenix alight? Only with a man of great capacity can the leviathan be borne." He then entrusted the task to our Master.

Our Master accepted the command and led his disciples to clear the brambles, mold tiles and bricks, and oversee the construction, which gradually took shape. In the winter of the *ding-you* year, the Perfected of True Constancy appointed him Preceptor of Daoist Affairs for the Daming and Ciluo circuits, bestowing upon him the title of *Qingzhen* Great Master. He was charged with traveling between Qin, Wei, and Zhao to manage these affairs. Within a decade, towering pavilions and magnificent abbeys stood renewed.

In the *geng-xu* year, Shi Demu, the governor of Luozhou, admiring our Master’s reputation and integrity, submitted a memorial to the throne, resulting in the bestowal of a golden crown and robes, along with the elevated title *Tongchen Hongmiao Zhenren* ("Perfected of Shared Dust and Vast Mystery"). In the spring of the *jia-yin* year, an imperial edict commanded the performance of the Great Universal Offering at the Grand Changchun Abbey in the capital. Our Master was selected among the eminent Daoists to participate. Upon its completion, he lingered among the abbeys of Xing and Luo, repairing any structures that remained unfinished.

In the *gui-hai* year of the Zhongtong era, the Perfected of Sincere Illumination ordered him to return to Louguan. He restored all that was lacking, and compared to previous eras, the abbey flourished severalfold. When the Zhiyuan era began, he received an imperial decree prohibiting civilians from encroaching upon the abbeys and forbidding officials and military personnel from lodging there, ensuring undisturbed rituals and recitations.

On the second day of the sixth month in the summer of the *bing-yin* year of the third Zhiyuan year, after bathing and composing himself as in life, he gathered his disciples before him. He exhorted them to remember the cultivation of the self and the benefit of others, then entrusted the succession to his disciple Shi Zhijian. The following day, he peacefully transcended, having lived seventy-eight years. As his breath stilled, residents of Jiaojia Alley north of the abbey witnessed five-colored clouds drifting in the sky, accompanied by the clear resonance of celestial music. Rushing to the scene, they beheld his ascension.

Despite the scorching heat, his complexion remained as though alive. After three days of offerings and rites, he was temporarily interred in the meditation chamber of his residence. The rites completed, a messenger was dispatched to inform his disciples at the mountain gate. On a certain day, at the Fengtian Abbey in Daming, a flock of cranes descended upon the altar hall, crying out. As the assembled gazed upward, the news of his passing arrived. Those who understood recognized it as the wanderings of his spirit.

Four years later, in the *geng-wu* year, his senior disciples selected the Clear Bright Festival to inter him at the Immortal’s Journey Hall of the Chengdao Abbey southeast of the city.

Our Master was pure and sincere, reverent and solemn, sitting upright throughout the day. To behold him was to sense an unassailable dignity. Yet when he taught, he was tireless, imparting the secrets of conserving essence, qi, and spirit. He always emphasized yielding to others while advancing oneself, and the principles of karmic retribution, adapting his guidance to each student’s capacity. He never spoke of delusion, illusion, or strange phenomena.

Though he engaged with worldly affairs, his cultivation of the true and nurturing of the vast never waned. He valued righteousness over wealth, practiced kindness and frugality, and embodied humility—virtues seemingly innate. Disciples from all directions flocked to him in numbers beyond count. The gold and silk offerings he received throughout the year filled the abbey’s treasury, all dedicated to construction and restoration. Beyond his robes, he accumulated no private wealth, and thus he attained longevity and a lofty reputation.

Wherever he journeyed, the powerful and the humble alike bowed twice in reverence, turning northward to serve him as their master. Could any but those whose hearts were truly sincere have achieved such devotion? As I once enjoyed the honor of his acquaintance, when his burial came to pass, Master Shi Zhijian recorded the broad outlines of his lifelong conduct and earnestly entreated me for an inscription to be carved in stone. Out of respect for the Dao he embodied, I could not refuse on grounds of my own inadequacy, and so I have set down these facts in verse:

The Dao of the Rare and Subtle—words cannot exhaust its wonders;
Only where sincerity moves can the Way be made known.
There was a man whose past wisdom filled him,
Heir to the mysteries, kin to the dust-bound sage.
In youth, his insight broke free from the cage,
Kindness and frugality dwelt in his humble heart.
Dragon and tiger mated—his perfection of the True Work,
Forging bone and flesh to melt as one.
His fame resounded, overshadowing Mounts Tai and Song;
Wherever he went, seekers flocked to learn the Uniting Principle.
Soaring west, gliding east, he spread the ancestral teaching,
Adapting to each, opening the eyes of the blind.
The thatched hut turned to ash—yet divine craft restored it;
Jade altars and towers rose in splendor.
When his work was complete and the Dao fulfilled, he knew his strength,
Withdrawing to a life of ease, his virtue ever more exalted.
A century wearied of the world, he wandered the vast emptiness,
Yet his radiance endures, undying within.
I compose this inscription to stand in the jade hall,
As enduring as heaven and earth from beginning to end.

*Inscription on the Stele of Master Xideng’s Daoist Conduct*
Composed by Wang Liyong, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Proper Consultation, and Vice Surveillance Commissioner of the Shaanxi Hanzhong Circuit

The Daoist tradition traces its lineage to recluses—those whose hearts are empty and still, whose bodies wander free and untrammeled, whose passions are purged of love and aversion, and whose resolve remains unshaken. In their teachings, they neither marry nor hold office, neither consume meat nor cling to impurity. They are kind and serene, poor yet content, gentle, yielding, and humble. Thus, Laozi and Zhuangzi in the Zhou, Zhongli Quan in the Han, and Lü Dongbin in the Tang—each followed in succession, though such figures appear but once in an age. Those who wear the cap and robe yet remain entangled in worldly thoughts and deeds are not worth discussing here.

During the Jin dynasty, the Patriarch Chongyang drank the sweet spring and attained the Dao. Master Danyang of the Elixir met Chongyang and cultivated the True. Zhao Yudou became Danyang’s successor, and Xideng Guang continued Zhao’s lineage. The teachings flourished, and the region of Guanzhong owed much to Master Xideng’s efforts.

The Master’s religious name was Yiqi, his courtesy name Shouyue, and his surname Ran. A native of Jingyang in Jingzhao, he was born in the *xinmao* year of the Dading era, endowed with extraordinary features. As a child, he shunned play, and as he grew, his bearing became grave, his beard flowing past his belly. Detached and desireless, he delighted in the mysteries of the Dao. His parents wished him to marry, but he vowed refusal and instead took Master Qingyang of the Peach Blossom as his teacher. He swept floors, bowed in supplication, and served with tireless devotion. Though scolded and humiliated, he never slackened, laboring day and night without rest for six years. Master Qingyang said, “Though you have endured tempering, your merit and conduct are not yet complete. Without a realized master’s guidance, how can you enter the Great Vehicle? The Recluse of the Eastern Mountains shares a thousand-karma bond with you—go and pay him homage.”

Urged on, he took his leave and, upon reaching Mount Li, encountered Master Liaozhen, Zhao Gong. There, he grasped the meaning of Qingyang’s words. After long immersion in the immortal’s subtle workings, he felt a silent resonance. Liaozhen said, “Your tranquil practice nears completion—redouble your efforts.” At the Tai Bai Yanxiang Abbey in Chang’an—a site where the Daoist Ancestor of the Tang had manifested—Master Danyang had already established a Hall of the Complete Truth. “This place will one day be a great field of merit,” Liaozhen said. “Remember it.” That same day, the Master set out westward. Passing through Liquan, the villagers urged him to stay in a humble hut. There, he regulated his breathing, sealed off worldly impulses, abandoned cunning and speech, recognized his mind, and perceived his nature. In less than three years, he entered the realm of the Great Mystery.

One day, a flame burst from the hut. The villagers, fearing disaster, rushed to the scene, only to find the Master sitting in serene meditation. Struck with awe, they realized the flame was divine radiance, and their reverence deepened. Weary of their incessant visits, the Master traveled to Shangyan, where he built a thatched hut called *Huanzhen* (Returning to the True) to dwell in peace. The land of Sanyang was high and remote, and water was scarce. Pointing to the eastern corner, the Master said, “The spring must lie here.” When they dug, water gushed forth, sweet and cool as syrup. He composed a poem:

*At the first stirring of yang, the Gate of Heaven trembles;
Know then that the land of Returning to the True holds its destiny.
Last night, the wayward dragon roared with thunder,
And the eye of the sea surged forth with a cold spring.*

After a decade, his reputation grew ever brighter, and disciples gathered in great numbers. Urged by virtuous friends from his hometown, he journeyed west to the Tai Bai Yanxiang Abbey, as Liaozhen had instructed, and became its abbot. Scholars and commoners alike came to pay their respects, offering paper and brushes to beg for his calligraphy. Some arrived with haughty demeanors, to whom he would present two poems. Upon returning home and unrolling them, they found not a single character. The next day, they returned to the Master’s seat and recounted the matter. Smiling, he said, “You never once opened your eyes. Read them again, and you will see.” When they unfurled the scrolls, the ink was plainly visible. Struck with remorse, they bowed in apology and departed.

When the military commissioner of Deng, adorned in gold and purple, fell gravely ill, he dreamed of a strange man offering him sacred water. Upon waking, he was cured and commissioned an artist to paint the figure’s likeness, which he venerated morning and night. Hearing that the Master was passing through Deng, he sent several men to intercept him on the road. Upon arrival, the commissioner exclaimed, “This is the very man from my dream!” He produced the portrait, and it was an exact likeness. Sensing his sincerity, the Master composed a poem for him:

*I recall fishing for four years past,
Yet to this day, I’ve not swallowed the hook.
How pitiful—the heron on the shoals,
Betraying the lone boat on the cold river.*

The Gold-and-Purple official bowed and received the poem.

In the autumn of the renchen year (1232), while residing in Zhechuan, he summoned his disciples Yang Zhijian and Zhang Daoxing and said to them, “As the year draws to a close, I shall depart.” On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh lunar month of that winter, he ordered the Daoist musicians to arrange themselves in order and sit, saying, “Why do you not bid me farewell with a feast?” Thereupon, he commanded them to sing loudly and dance. When the fourth watch arrived, he left behind a verse:

*The Four Great have no master,
Encompassing a form beyond the world.
Within the gourd, heaven and earth are fine—
I ride home astride a purple qilin.*

Having recited the verse, he cast aside his brush and sat upright. Then he shed his mortal form, aged sixty-two. His disciples divined an auspicious site for a temporary burial, where he was interred with the rites of grain ingestion. The following year, his disciples Bai Zhirou and others wished to rebury him beside the immortal’s tomb of Master Liaozhen in Fanchuan. When they burned incense and opened the coffin, his face appeared as in life, a testament to his lifelong cultivation.

In the winter of the guiwei year (1243), his dharma heirs—Supervisor Zhao Zhihui, Director Wang Zhiling, and Abbot Li Daohe—presented an account of the Master’s conduct to Daoist friend Tongzhenzi, entreating me to compose an inscription. They said, “Our Master’s spirit was luminous and clear; emptiness gave rise to brilliance. He thoroughly understood the scriptures and could compose with untrammeled brush. In the past, his writings and poems numbered nearly four hundred, and he guided over a thousand disciples. Though his tomb bears an epitaph, without a stele recording his Dao and conduct, how can his legacy be made known to the world and endure for posterity?”

Moved by their earnest plea, I composed this inscription:

*Refining gold, its essence pure,
Like jade, its resonance clear and bright.
His virtue matched the Two Modes,
His excellence drew from the Five Phases.
Words flowed as arrows loosed,
Writing poured forth with unchecked brush.
Subduing dragons and tigers,
He soared through the numbers of the River and Luo.
Riding wind and qi,
He roamed the paths of the roc’s ninety thousand leagues.
His coming was like a lone cloud,
His going swift as thunder.
Who can fathom the mystery of the lamp’s cleansing?
Behold this verdant, imperishable inscription.*

**Stele Inscription for the Conduct of Tongzhenzi Qin**
*Composed by Yuanyin of Yishan, the Recluse*

Tongzhenzi’s given name was Zhi’an, and his courtesy name was Yanrong. He was born into the Qin clan of Lingchuan. His grandfather, Qin Shi, was well-versed in the classics and ancient learning, skilled in large-character calligraphy, and highly esteemed in his hometown. His father, Qin Lüe, styled Jianfu, struggled in the imperial examinations in middle age and thereafter devoted himself to poetry, adopting the sobriquet “Daoist of West Stream.” His work bore an ancient spirit, refined yet leaving no trace, and was highly praised by contemporary scholars.

He had two sons, of whom Tongzhenzi was the elder. From an early age, Tongzhenzi aspired to lofty elegance. Though he sat for the imperial examinations thrice, he remained indifferent to success or failure. At the beginning of the Zhenyou era (1213–1217), he fled south to escape the chaos. His father, West Stream, was torn between joy and fear, and his relatives urged him to seek an official post for filial support. Reluctantly, he took the examinations once more but was dismissed before the imperial curtain. During the Zhengda era (1224–1232), West Stream passed away. By then, Tongzhenzi was forty, and he thereafter disregarded family affairs, wandering freely among the Song and Shaoshi mountains. He began studying books from beyond the world, seeking the essentials of cultivating the mind and nurturing nature.

Later, he harbored doubts about the teachings of the Two Schools. He consulted Chan monks, but they plunged him into confusion, leaving him with nothing to verify. Thus, he turned to study with Daoists. After Henan fell, he returned north and encountered Master Song Piyun in Shangdang. After just a few words, they found affinity, and he sighed, “I have found my true home.” Thereupon, he became his disciple, observing the rites of a student, and sought to peruse the Daoist canon. Piyun told him, “After the devastation of war, few texts remain. Only the works of Guan and Cen survive. I wish to revive this lost tradition and disseminate its teachings, but I lack someone to shoulder this responsibility. To cultivate oneself alone—how is this better than sharing it with the world?”

Tongzhenzi bowed twice and said, “I humbly accept your instruction.”

Thus, he undertook the task of supplementing and correcting [the texts], with much of the work coming from his own hand. During this time, he received imperial favor, leveraging the influence of high-ranking officials to advance his efforts in every possible way. Ultimately, he succeeded in reviving the tradition, allowing the authentic Daoist teachings to spread far and wide, and Tongzhenzi’s reputation in the Dao likewise flourished in his era.

Tongzhenzi’s learning was vast and comprehensive, his literary compositions swift and skillful. He delighted in teaching and guiding others, never setting himself apart with arrogance. Residing in Xuandu for nearly a decade, though daily occupied with rigorous textual collation, those who came from afar to study the profound mysteries of the Dao and receive instruction in its scriptures arrived in an unbroken stream. Other masters who held teaching positions could only gaze in admiration, sighing at the vastness before them.

In the fifth month after the completion of the repository, he addressed his disciples, saying: “The preservation or decay of the sacred treasury concerns both the seen and unseen realms; in the hidden depths, there must be unseen forces at work. Now that the great task is complete, it is time for me to depart.” Twenty-five days later, at midnight, the sky was clear and cloudless when suddenly a violent thunderclap and fierce wind arose, uprooting great trees. He then bathed, changed his robes, and shed his form in the Lingli Hall where he resided, at the age of fifty-seven.

His disciples, led by Li Zhishi, in accordance with the Dingwei year, month, and day, enshrined his robes and cap to pacify his spirit at the foot of the Altar of Heaven, as Master Piyun had commanded. His work, the *Linquan Collection* in twenty volumes, circulated in the world.

Formerly, my late father served as magistrate of Lingchuan. When I was just coming of age, I met Tongzhenzi’s grandfather, who resided in leisure on Mount Song and had been a poetic and drinking companion of Xixi for fifteen years. Tongzhenzi, bound by the weight of our familial ties and finding our paths in the Dao aligned and our minds in harmony, led his disciples to bow a hundred times and beseech me to compose an inscription for his master. This spring in the second month, one Liu Zhiqing again journeyed from Jishang to visit me in Xinxing. Through ice and snow, enduring the bitter cold, he traversed a thousand li—his devotion was truly pitiable, let alone the weight of his lifelong words. Thus, I composed this inscription and had it engraved on the Pine Terrace. The inscription reads:

Long ago at Qiongsang, the true source first flowed forth,
Carving open the people’s ears and eyes, the spirit then made whole.
Yet in the Yuan and Er years, the earth’s axis turned,
The kalpa on the verge of ruin, before the dawn of a new age.

Who was fit to inherit the Dao Mountain’s lofty legacy?
Amid a hundred blooms, the great mystery was fully grasped.
There was one man—serene and single-minded—
Who, like Yi and Lao, sat at the first feast unchanged.

Who first strained to draw up the dark net of the Dao?
Who endured hardship to the end, steadfast as I?
He gathered scattered slips with his own hands,
Through cold and heat, never ceasing his red and yellow studies.

Jade cases and coral peaks emerged from the nine abysses,
Trailing rays like eight-cornered stars and hanging suns.
Though fit to ascend as Controller of Works and Accounts,
Now he soars from the bottle like a flying crow.

To dwell in ease and follow fate—wise men of old prized this;
To die yet not perish—could this be so?
Among the nine barriers of Huayang, his name stands as one—
How could he not cast off his form, nearly a guest of heaven?

Did he extend the *Yan Kang* and turn the *Ling Pian*?
Did he refine the elixir pearl and compose the seven-character verses?
Did he collate the Tiger Script and revise the Three Origins?
Did he expound on the Nine Profound and transcend the ordinary?

Would he ever wrap hooves in purple smoke?
Would he ever simmer unicorn horns to string a zither?
Would he ever tend a thousand households’ mushroom fields?
Would he ever guide seven ancestors to withered Chan?

The Pine Terrace bears this inscription, to be read for a thousand years—
I recognize in this Master no mere stubborn immortal.

**Records of Master Wang of Shu Zhai**

Master Wang’s surname was Wang, his given name Cui, and his courtesy name Zizheng. He hailed from a prominent family of Beiping. Gifted in talent and vast in learning, he gained poetic renown in his youth, and every verse he composed was savored by all. Yet he kept his distance from the world and did not pursue the imperial examinations. During the Zhengda era, he briefly sojourned in Deng.

At the time, Duke Qi Shui was garrisoning Tang and Deng. Fond of literature and delighted in the company of scholars, many renowned figures from the central court gathered under his patronage, and the Master also became a guest at his gate. When the imperial troops advanced south and the people of Xiangyang were relocated, the Master drifted along the Jiang and Han rivers.

In the Jiawu year, Magistrate Yang Yancheng was ordered to recruit followers from the three teachings—medicine, divination, and the like—and scholars were thus able to preserve their learning and return to the Central Plains. Magistrate Yang alone welcomed the Master to Yan, where he encountered the Great Master Zhenchang. He immediately became his disciple, observing the rites of a student, and resided at Changchun Palace.

Zhenchang treated him with great favor and entrusted him with the transmission of his ancestral lineage, intending to preserve it in the secret archives for posterity. The Master then settled in Cuixuan Hall, where he devoted himself to meticulous study, seeking far and wide, delving deeply, and compiling his findings. At over forty years of age, he passed away without illness in the ninth month of the Guimao year.

Before ten days had passed, he appeared in a dream to Zhang Chengming, speaking to him as intimately as in life. After a while, he composed a poem and took his leave:
*"In those days, I always resented how early the flowers bloomed;
Now, seeing them bloom, the flowers are already old.
How long can flowers bloom and fall?
Turning back, I see the spring light is still fine."*

At dawn, Chengming recounted the dream’s poem to Great Master Zhenchang. Zhenchang sighed and said, *"Zizheng has become an immortal."* Those who heard this marveled at it.

The Master was a man of tranquil and indifferent nature, free from scheming, incorruptible, and upright. In his dealings with others, he was always sincere. Whenever he heard of someone of virtuous conduct, even if they lived in poverty in a humble alley, he would visit them. He was fond of reading and excelled in writing, particularly in poetry. His five-character verses were elegant and refined, evoking the style of Tao Yuanming and Wei Yingwu.

**Records of Master Zhang of Ne An**

Master Zhang’s given name was Ben, and his courtesy name Minzhi. He was a native of Guanjin. In his youth, he was a schoolmate of the Perfected Zhenchang. When Zhenchang first entered the Dao, the Master urged him to consider his familial line, but once he realized his resolve was unshakable, they each spoke of their aspirations and parted.

In the second year of the Zhenyou era, the Master ranked highly in the *ci* and *fu* examinations. He was skilled in large seal and clerical scripts throughout his life, and his poetry carried a distinctly ancient tone. In the ninth year of the Zhengda era, he was sent north as a Hanlin Academician but was detained and subsequently became a Daoist priest. He resided at Changchun Palace in Yanjing for nearly ten years. At the time, Zhenchang oversaw the Daoist teachings and treated him as an elder brother, as before, providing for him with utmost courtesy. Later, he traveled to Jinan and passed away peacefully.

*End of Volume Seven of* Records of the Immortal Source at Ganshui.

He meticulously collated and corrected the Three Caverns, Four Supplements, and the over eighteen thousand scrolls. Much of what emerged from his hand was thus refined.

*[The following passage appears in the Yifeng Hall rubbings of* The Collected Works of Yishan, *Volume 31, "Epitaph for Master Tongzhen": "He further incorporated* The Record of the Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage*,* The Record of Cloud and Mist*,* The Biographies of Yi Xian and Wei Xian, *and other accounts. This work began in the dingyou year and concluded in the jiachen year."]*

*[Note: "Repository" should read "precious treasury."]*

His disciples Li Zhishi and others, in the dingwei year, on a certain day and month, enshrined his robes and cap to pacify his spirit at the foot of the Altar of Heaven.

*[In the Yifeng Hall rubbings of* The Collected Works of Yishan, *"Epitaph for Master Tongzhen" reads: "His disciples Li Zhishi, Guo Zhixi, and others, in the first month of the yisi year, enshrined his robes and cap to pacify his spirit at the foot of the Altar of Heaven."]*

Compiled by Li Daoqian, the Tianle Daoist of Yimen
*Epitaph for the Pure Perfected Master Li*

Commissioned by Li Weiqing, Imperial Instructor of the Huaimeng Circuit

When Lecturer Li passed away, his friend Shen, Director of the Bureau of Daoist Affairs, informed me and said: "The Lecturer’s conduct was steadfast and upright, his virtue and learning profound and pure—this was known to all. Before his passing, he entrusted his final affairs, and the arrangements for his burial site have now been settled. Without an inscription, there would be no way to console the departed. I hope you will record in detail what you have heard."

The Lecturer’s personal name was Zhiquan, his courtesy name Dingchen, and he was a native of Taiyuan Taigu. In his youth, he studied for the imperial examinations. His father, Xunzhi, passed the examinations in the fifth year of the Mingchang era through mastery of the classics. The Lecturer, however, was of lofty and unconventional ambition, upholding the family tradition with diligent study, regarding wealth and rank as easily as reaching into a bag. When he came of age, the world unexpectedly fell into turmoil—warfare erupted daily, and he could no longer pursue his aspirations with restless urgency.

At that time, the Emperor was fond of the Dao of longevity and summoned Qiu Changchun from ten thousand *li* away, receiving him with the highest honors. The mystic wind flourished, and all who heard of it were inspired. Thus, the Lecturer turned his heart toward Daoism, seeking initiation under Master Zhang of Heyang. When Changchun returned from the West, the Lecturer, staff in hand, journeyed on foot to meet him at the Longyang Abbey in Fengsheng, where he received the esoteric teachings of the Dao along with his religious name. Thereafter, he lived in the mountains for many years, his reputation growing ever more renowned.

Later, Song Piyun of Laizhou burned the Daoist scriptures in his possession during the chaos of war. By imperial decree, the remnants were gathered from the ashes, but they were scattered and beyond recovery. Scholars of vast learning and rare knowledge were sought to collate and organize them, and the Lecturer was chosen. For ten years, he labored tirelessly from dawn to dusk. The sacred texts of the Three Caverns were restored to completeness—a feat of no small merit.

The Daoist leader Li Zhenchang, by imperial favor, bestowed upon him the title *Pure Perfected Great Master* and appointed him Director of the Mystic Learning Academy in Yanjing. Before long, he returned to his former retreat at the Altar of Heaven, wandering among cliffs and valleys, intending to spend his final years there. Suddenly, he ascended to the heavens—this occurred on a day in the sixth month of the second year of the Zhongtong era. He was seventy-one years old.

His writings, titled *The Harmonious Spring Collection*, comprise thirty *juan* and circulate in the world. He also compiled twenty *juan* of poems and rhapsodies by the Seven Perfected and later masters, entitled *The Garden of Cultivating the Real*. Alas! Scholars have remarked that with his talent and learning, passing the imperial examinations would not have been difficult. Yet the world was in turmoil, and the region north of the Yellow River was especially chaotic—merely preserving one’s life was arduous, and each day passed like a year. His youthful ambitions withered, and he willingly buried himself in the dust. Who would have known him? His name would surely have faded into oblivion. Compared to those lost in the wilderness, forgotten and unheard of, how different was his fate?

Thus, the inscription reads:
Ah! Pure Perfected,
In youth, he wore the scholar’s cap,
Studied for years,
And sat for the autumn examinations.
Vowing to soar with a single bound,
Like the roc’s nine-thousand-*li* flight,
Yet fate had its trials,
And the world knew no lasting peace.
Suddenly, he turned to the Dao,
His heart steadfast as cinnabar.
When Changchun returned from the West,
Auspicious stars vied for sight.
A thousand *li* he walked,
Staff in hand, to meet him,
Receiving the Dao’s mysteries,
And wearing its fragrance like orchids.
With苦心 he refined himself,
Through countless cycles of heat and cold,
Aspiring to wander the Jade Capital—
This was no difficult feat.
The Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures,
Scattered in ashes and ruin,
He collated for a decade,
Restoring them to completeness.
Brushing off his robes, he soared high,
His refined ambition set on mountains and forests.
Returning to his old retreat,
He wandered there in his final years.
Suddenly, he departed as an immortal,
Those who heard grieved deeply.
Engraved upon this lustrous stone,
Let passersby examine it closely.
Know then that within the Dao,
Phoenixes and simurghs soar.

*Stele Inscription for the Virtuous Conduct of Perfected Gao of Universal Salvation and Illuminating Clarity*
Composed by Yao Sui, Instructor of the Anxi Prince’s Mansion

Since our Yuan’s Taizu, the Sagely Martial Emperor, recognized Qiu Changchun as a man of the Dao and invited him to lead the Mystic Gate, the subsequent emperors—Taizong, Dingzong, Xianzong, and the present Son of Heaven—have all inherited this filial devotion from Heaven, nobly continuing the tradition. Though Changchun departed to the Real and did not leave his position vacant, Yin Qinghe, Li Zhenchang, Zhang Chengming, Wang Chunzhen, and now Zhang Xuanyi have succeeded him in turn, residing in the same manner as Qiu did in Taizu’s time.

Their disciples, recognizing the imperial court’s reverence for the flourishing of this Dao, refer to their master’s residence not by name but as "Beneath the Hall." Though "Beneath the Hall" governs the capital, the ancestral master’s repository and the abode where he attained the Dao lie in present-day Liujiang of Mount Zhongnan. Viewed from "Beneath the Hall," they are like the root of a tree or the source of a river—only when these are lush and deep can one ensure the lineage’s prosperity. Thus, all who come from the four directions to "Beneath the Hall" with offerings for the incense fire must allocate a portion to the ancestral sanctuary, supporting the needs of propagating the teachings and expanding the Dao.

This is not the only reason—it is the same with people. If one is capable of bearing the responsibility of propagating the teachings and expanding the Dao, they must be promoted to the ancestral sanctuary, entrusted with duties, and not left idle in useless places. Alas! Talent varies in greatness, so responsibilities differ in weight; virtue varies in prominence, so positions differ in duration. From Qin to Xia, Liang to Shu, governance extended only halfway to "Beneath the Hall," yet their responsibilities were as weighty as that. Since Gengzi, when he entered the Pass from Dongzhen, forty years have passed, and those who have held office in the Daoist teachings have resided there for only two decades—such longevity is rare. Then, for one whose talent is great and whose virtue is prominent, must we still rely on words to make it known?

The Perfected’s surname was Gao, his personal name Daokuan, and his courtesy name Yuanzhi. He was a native of Huairen in Yingzhou. His family had long been wealthy, though their lineage is not recorded in detail. In his youth, he studied the classics and was able to grasp their essential meanings.

In his early years, he served as an official in Chang’an. After enduring the mourning periods for both his parents, he abandoned his household to become a Daoist master in the yellow turban. Of the three masters from whom he received instruction, the first was An Penglai, who traced the source of the tradition; next was Li Chongxu, who expanded its flow; and finally, Yu Dongzhen, who harmonized its convergence and guided its return. Thus, he studied longest at Dongzhen’s gate, and Dongzhen, relying on him as a worthy recipient, was able to greatly transmit his teachings. Having imparted to him the subtle words of the Dao and virtue, he also bestowed the *Shangqing Zixu Lu* and granted him the title *Yuanmingzi*. He was appointed to oversee Chongyang Wanshou Palace and to superintend Ganhe Yuxian Palace.

In the year *renzi*, Zhenchang promoted him to *Daolu* of the Jingzhao Circuit, a position he held for a decade. In the *xinyou* year of Zhongtong, Chengming recommended him to the court, and by imperial decree, he was appointed to superintend Daoist affairs in Shaanxi, Xingyuan, and other circuits, concurrently overseeing Chongyang Wanshou Palace. In the *xinwei* year of Zhiyuan, Chunzhen succeeded him as *Zunshi*, adding *Changbaode* above *Yuanming*. In the *bingzi* year, the Empress Dowager and the Imperial Prince, Anxi Wang, each bestowed upon him a set of golden *yunluo* robes and crowns. The imperial edict further entrusted him with the administration of Daoist affairs in western Shu, while still retaining *Yuanming*, though his title was changed from *Changbaode* to *Dongguan Puji*, and *Zunshi* to *Zhenren*.

In the spring of the *dingchou* year, on the twenty-fifth day of the first month, he ascended on high. Counting backward, he had lived eighty-three springs by the nineteenth day of the seventh month in the *yimao* year of Jin Mingchang. His cap and sandals were laid to rest in the garden of his immortal remains.

In the fifth month of that year, his successor, *Zhenren* Li Tianle, recorded his deeds and entrusted Daoist Registrar Guo Zhixiang to present them to Sui, saying: "The virtue of the *Zhenren* should be celebrated in verse—this task falls to you." Sui replied: "The words of the successor *Zhenren* and the Daoist Registrar cannot be declined, for death has now reached the time of the former *Zhenren*’s soaring wind." Thus, he composed a poem, which reads:

*In former days, when you were born,*
*In Huairen of Ying, your life began.*
*Later, with war’s tumultuous rise,*
*You fled to Qin, a refuge found.*

In his youth, he devoted himself to reading; in adulthood, he took official posts, serving his parents in the east with filial devotion. Yet the times were harsh and perilous, the winds of sorrow entwined like trees—thus he severed worldly love and set his heart single-mindedly on seeking immortality.

In the still of night, his inner light shone bright; the gates of heaven opened their mysteries. Jade palaces rose in splendor, and sacred banners fluttered in flight. All this arose from his daily accumulation of vision and thought—it was no distant marvel, but the wondrous work of focused intent. With his penetrating insight, how could he fail to awaken? For he trusted firmly in the steadfastness of his spirit.

Who, then, was his teacher? It was Master An. Though his glimpse of the Way was faint and his learning scant, he wandered eastward amid the chaos of Bian waters. There, Sun of Danyang, leaning upon Master Chongxu, appeared. Yet when he approached the gate, he found the teachings manifold and often harsh, testing his resolve to its limits. He was fed impurities to observe his endurance, and though time passed, his resolve never wavered. He was cast into menial labor, tasks even servants found arduous—yet while others toiled briefly, he remained at ease, growing ever more composed. His faith in Master Chongxu deepened, and day by day, his transformation became evident. When the time came for renewal and transmission, the secrets were already within him.

The carriage of Master Dongzhen was prepared and anointed, and court discussions brimmed with concern. Swiftly, he fled and evaded. He then urged Master Chongxu to confess and submit, joining his disciples and selecting companions for the journey. Master Chongxu admonished him, saying: "Among all, only this man—Sun of Danyang—shall guide you closely." Like one who enters a cave on Mount Wu or ascends the peaks of the Qinling, his understanding of the Dao grew daily. Those who crouch over magpie eggs know to seek the phoenix of Lu; you, now fortunate in your time, still ascend by a ladder.

At last, he accompanied Master Dongzhen from Long to Bian, riding the wind in his wake, his perceptions twice transformed. Master Dongzhen remained to preside over the Central Taiyi Palace, while he chose not to depart, nearly becoming as one with the crows. When the imperial procession changed course, he began his journey north, building a hut in Dexing to conceal himself.

Master Dongzhen later crossed into Yan, leading his disciples eastward, spreading teachings along the White Waters. He summoned him to follow. Yet in his pursuit of the Dao, he held the world lightly, content in solitude. Wandering among clouds and mountains, he often clashed with worldly ways. Some turned back to him, blending with the dust, unburdened—drawn to official halls, they sought warmth and favor. Others, in their defiance, lost themselves entirely. Neither path, measured by the Dao, was tenable. The first lost sight of others; the latter forgot the self.

How could one know the perfected person, who moves with the world’s currents, deepening the wellspring of the spirit, filling it with the fullness of principle? As for me, what was once your external affliction, I taught you to let go—embracing non-action, tranquility, and emptiness. Above, in the realms of humans and heavens, lies the origin of nature and destiny. I wished you to internalize these truths, the words of the mysterious sages. Yet you clung to this teaching, bound like a wheel’s hub, confined to a narrow frame, having never heard the greater Way.

Cultivating the self brings attainment; benefiting others sustains life. These virtues, like a potter’s wheel, may turn together—what harm is there in their union? Strive to engage with the world, do not shrink back in fear. Like metal sharpened on stone, dullness is honed to keen edge. Remember this, young one, and bear it with diligence.

He bowed deeply, receiving the instruction without reluctance. Later, he attended the funeral of Patriarchs Liu and Jiang. Amid the chaos of war in Guanzhong, the land lay in ruins, overgrown with brambles. White bones littered the hills, and bears and tigers roamed in packs. Yet in time, halls rose, their towers piercing the clouds.

Later, at Zhongnan, his constructions were unmatched. He assisted in their building, shouldering tasks with few resources. His conduct in mourning moved all quarters; his words stirred even the stubborn. Empty carriages and coffers returned filled. Though his labors were many, he claimed nothing. Bells and drums resounded in the palace, and praise filled every mouth.

Master Dongzhen, too, hoped to revive the mystic wind, appointing him to oversee Chongyang and Ganhe Palaces. Master Zhenchang elevated him, entrusting him with recording Daoist teachings. His jurisdiction spanned a thousand *li*, encompassing the capital region. He adorned the jade halls, streamlined their regulations, and like grass bending to the wind, his teachings flourished and spread.

With sincerity and clarity, he memorialized the throne, becoming Director of Yanqing. From Long to the southern mountains of Qin, his governance extended far. Who among the high officials was not granted such authority? Even imperial sons were not his equal. The lands bestowed upon him were vast—unmatched in ancient or recent times.

The Emperor declared: "Admirable! You hold dominion beyond the Yellow River. Let offices be filled by ability, and appointments made by imperial decree." Thus, he issued edicts, expanding his charge to the Two Chuan. All Daoists in Shu, from that day forth, began to revere him.

He often observed that governance is easy, but teaching is difficult. Governance relies on rewards and punishments, guiding people through incentives and deterrents. Teaching, however, leads by the Dao, fostering filial piety and fraternal duty. Where lies the difficulty? In the teacher’s inability to embody it first.

Alas, teaching the Dao is even harder. It is like selling shorn hair or shaved heads—who would buy? Those who abandon fundamental ethics, what reverence do they hold for their teachers? Without rewards to entice or punishments to compel, they come when they will and leave without restraint. Gathered in throngs, they follow their desires.

If the teaching is not of the Dao, none will follow it now or later. Who, after long neglect, would turn their hearts to the noble or the base? Yet you, dwelling in this role for over two decades, at eighty-three years, quietly yielded to fate. Your cap and sandals rest in the garden of your immortal remains—who shall succeed you?

You had once spoken of Tianle, whom I hold in deep regard. It is not my partiality, but the richness of your own legacy. I entrust you with the seal and casket, the robes and imperial decree. If you refuse, who else could bear this mantle?

As your noble wind fades into the distance, the imperial son mourns in sorrow. He commands Tianle to follow your final bequest, establishing your position and upholding your teachings. O imperial son, lean upon this, and in the end, you shall know him.

On the northern mountains, stones endure through the ages, unyielding. A tortoise forms the base, its head adorned with jade. Here, beneath the shade of the clear Wei, I erect this monument. I carve this inscription and poem to illuminate the present and future.

*Biography of Master Chu, the True Recluse of Mount Taihua*
Compiled by Yao Sui, Scholar of the Prince of Anxi’s Court

Master Chu, the True Recluse of Lingtai, in his youth studied the classics. In later years, amid the hardships of the age, he sought refuge and escape, taking shelter in the teachings of Laozi. He studied under Master Liu Zhenchang, dwelling not in cities but often in famous mountains—such as the caves of Ge Hong in Bao, the Seven Peaks of Langye, and the sacred peaks of Ying—without fixed abode.

Later, when Master Liu Zhenchang presided over the Yuntai Palace in Huayin, Master Chu first followed him there to the west. After Zhenchang passed away, he moved to Shangfang, leaving his disciples to tend the Yuntai Palace.

Mount Huayue grew ever more wondrous. Shangfang, in turn, was the most perilous peak under heaven. Gazing upward from its base, one saw sheer cliffs scraping the clouds, towering and precipitous—without iron chains, none could ascend or descend. Who forged these chains, and in what age or by whose design, remains unknown; surely they were sages who mastered peril. Nearing the summit, one looked down into abyssal ravines, plunging for miles, where blind mists swirled thickly. Few could endure the sight without dizziness or their spirits shaken—yet Master Chu carried his own provisions up and down, as effortlessly as walking from hall to inner chamber. When the cold grew sharp, he redoubled his efforts, hauling food to prepare for winter. One year, his supplies failed to arrive in time; ice and snow sealed the mountain pass, and the chill was but half that of a usual winter. He then practiced *qi*-absorption and stored food for embryonic breathing, sometimes going days without lighting a stove.

The next year, when the mountain pass reopened, his disciples went to mourn, seeking his remains. Instead, they found him walking and speaking as robustly as before, and only then did they marvel that he was no ordinary man. As he prepared to descend, they entreated him, saying: "You must never return. Had you starved to death in the ice and snow, though we had mouths, how could we ever justify our filial duty to the world? You must never come back." Master Chu found their pleas hard to refuse. Pointing to Niuxin Valley, he said: "This is the Scholarly Market where the Han Grand Commandant Yang Zhen once taught." Some who heard this doubted the tradition, for while they knew Yang had indeed taught there, they had never heard of his residing in Huayin. Master Chu offered no source for his claim.

South of the valley, directly aligned with Zhongfang, after walking two *li* or so, one entered a realm of dense forests, strange rocks, and streams murmuring below. He cleared over an acre of land and built a hut no larger than a few paces in length and width. Around it, he planted fine flowers and graceful bamboo. Visitors at first loved its secluded tranquility, unaware they had left the dust of the world behind. Yet after no more than a day, they would yawn and stretch, suddenly longing to depart. Master Chu then dismissed his disciples to live alone. When urged to keep at least one to assist him, he replied: "I find joy here; they find sorrow. Our peace differs from the start. Even if I insisted they stay, they could endure no more than a month before inevitably leaving. Thus, I make this pact: unless provisions and firewood are utterly exhausted, they may go when they wish. This is how the ancients judged others by their own standards, without demanding absolute loyalty."

When he left the mountain to return to Yuntai Palace, he waited until the waters froze and drinking became impossible—using the tenth month as his signal, returning to the valley in the second month. By nature, he loved reading, especially the *Zuozhuan* and *Extensive Discussions*, and daily ate several birds. He drank wine but stopped before intoxication, never allowing himself to become fully drunk. When households obtained fine wine, they vied to offer it to him. Upon receiving it, he would submerge the jars in a spring, then sit by the forest or on a rock, ladling the wine and drinking alone. At sunset, he retired to his hut to rest, rising after sleep to walk in the courtyard.

One evening, he heard rustling in the woods. "A beast," he said, though he could not name it, he could discern it by sound. He hurled a stone, declaring, "A deer or elk—it will bolt in fright." If it lingered, it was a tiger. Indeed, it stayed, unmoving. The next morning, he saw tiger tracks crisscrossing outside the fence. The following night, the same sounds returned, but he took no precaution. Those who heard the tale marveled at his divine insight.

Other travelers—woodcutters, hunters—sometimes came to the mountain, unaware of his identity. He would demand they prepare meals, offer his bed, and even endure their scoldings and insults with equanimity, showing no anger or resentment, as if it were his duty. When they left and asked his name, he would speak of other things, never revealing it. Pressed further, he would say: "Do I seek to know others? Must I seek others' knowledge of me? My dwelling here is no one's concern, nor is it mine to disclose."

Though he seemed to mortify himself and defy human sentiment, he did not reject worldly customs. From princes and nobles down to petty officials and servants, all vied to catch a glimpse of him, counting it a joy. I, Yao Sui, also visited his hut once or twice. When I spoke of worldly fame and profit, his response was as fleeting as autumn wind passing his ears—he remained silent, offering no reply. But when I asked about the joys of mountain life, he would recount all the fine rocks, secluded trees, sweet springs, and perilous plank paths he had seen, speaking endlessly, forgetting to stop. "If only others could visit," he would say, "and I could guide them first." After parting, I felt my heart's dust and vulgarity melt away like snow under the sun, leaving no trace for days. Thus, I grew ever more certain that beyond the mundane world, there existed men of serenity, joy, and retreat like Master Chu—rare and beyond comparison.

Master Chu’s given name was Zhitong, and his courtesy name was Boda. His name reached the imperial ear, and when prayers for rain or drought were answered, he was not honored with riches but instead granted the title *Youde Zhenren* ("Perfected One Who Assists Virtue") and appointed *Tidian* (Supervisor) of the Yue Shrine and *Xieling* Palace. When the Yue Shrine’s halls threatened to collapse, the emperor personally allocated 18,000 strings of cash for repairs. Within three years, the dilapidated structures were renewed, their shabbiness transformed into simplicity. Visitors marveled at the change, realizing he possessed administrative talent—though he had concealed it.

At eighty, his virtue deepened, and his fame spread further. The sagely emperor grew ever more eager to see him. In the year *jimao* (1279), the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, an imperial envoy was dispatched to summon him. Facing north, he received the decree and bowed, saying: "I, Zhitong, am but a rustic subject. I know myself well. In my youth, my words were unworthy of the court’s selection, and my strength insufficient to defend against invaders. Now, in old age, I will soon fill the ditches like an old dog or horse. Though I rise each morning and evening under the dragon’s radiance, forcing myself to comply, I fear I will not reach the capital. To do so might harm Your Majesty’s benevolence, which extends even to plants and trees. Thus, I dare, at the risk of death, to make this plea."

The imperial envoy ultimately returned with an empty carriage.

Now, Minister Li, who deeply knows the Master and delights in extolling others’ virtues, has cautioned me to transmit this account, lest it remain unknown in the present and fade into oblivion thereafter.

The Master’s name was Dehui, styled Zhongshi. Formerly, he served as a provincial administrator in the Beijing Circuit; now, he has been appointed Grand Master for Thorough Service and sent to govern Anxi Prefecture.

*The Record of Master Shi’s Daoist Conduct*
Composed by Wang Que, *jinshi* of the preceding reign, styled Shundu the Reclusive Elder

The Master’s name was Zhijing, styled Tianwei. A native of Yicheng in Jiangzhou, his family had long pursued Confucian learning. His grandfather, Bin, styled Zhizhong, and his father, Gongzuo, styled Liangchen, both concealed their virtue and never sought renown.

Born in the *renxu* year of the Taihe era (1202), the Master displayed precocious wisdom from infancy, possessing an innate affinity for the Dao. At six, he studied composition under Ji Deju of his village, his natural intelligence surpassing his peers. In the *jiaxu* year of the Zhenyou era (1214), Yicheng fell to invaders a second time, and he fled to Yunzhong, where he lodged with the household of Wanyan. Observing his exceptional qualities, they raised him as their own son.

In the *xinsi* year of the Xingding era (1221), he withdrew to pursue the Dao, taking Liu Zhenchang of Mount Heng as his teacher. At their first meeting, the master recognized his worth and consulted him on all matters. In the *guiwei* year (1223), Grand Master Changchun returned in response to the imperial summons. The Master, accompanied by his teacher, paid homage at Abuhan’s private residence, where Changchun bestowed upon him his present name.

Thereafter, his Daoist conduct flourished daily. He wandered among the regions of Yu, Dai, Shuo, and Ying, refining his studies with diligence, enduring coarse robes and frugal meals, yet ever content. In the *bingshen* year (1236), the Elder Qinghe and Magistrate Tian of Jingzhao discussed restoring the Yuntai Abbey on Mount Hua. They entreated Master Zhenchang, who consented and dispatched his disciples to clear the brambles, haul away rubble, and bricks. Within a few years, the abbey gradually attained completion.

The community of Yuntai Abbey proposed the Master as its abbot, but he declined. In the *xinchou* year (1241), a messenger arrived bearing a letter and a horse, inviting him. The Master, long inclined toward a western journey, gladly set forth. In the eighth month of autumn, he reached Huafeng. Regarding Mount Hua as a sacred peak with many numinous traces now obscured by war, he sought out wonders and anomalies, personally verifying what he heard. He collected inscriptions, biographies, poems, and essays by ancient and modern scholars, sparing no effort until he obtained all he sought. Thus, he compiled *The Record of Mount Hua* in fourteen fascicles.

In the *bingwu* year (1246), Master Zhenchang ascended to immortality. The Master traveled to Hunyuan to mourn him, observing three years of heartfelt mourning. In the *jiyou* year (1249), he paid homage to the Perfected of the Cavernous Truth and received scriptures and registers. In the *gengxu* year (1250), the Preceptor Li repeatedly summoned him by letter. Unable to decline, he came to Yan. During lectures on the Mysteries, he received the subtle principles of the *Yi* and the *Laozi*.

In the *xinhai* year (1251), he accompanied the Perfected north to pay homage to the court, where he was granted a purple robe by imperial decree and honored as Grand Master for Propagating the Truth. In the *renzi* year (1252), he again followed the Perfected to perform the border sacrifices at the mountains and rivers. In the *wuwu* year (1258), he journeyed east to the seacoast, visiting the former residences of the Seven Perfected and tracing the transformative traces of Ancestral Master Chongyang.

In the spring of the *guihai* year (1263), he returned to Yan from Deng and Lai. Throughout his life, the Master delighted in writing. His prose eschewed ornate embellishment, consisting entirely of truthful words. His works, totaling millions of characters, all possess coherence and insight, devoid of verbose or frivolous passages. His *Record of Mount Hua*, in particular, is exhaustive in detail, reflecting his utmost dedication—unmatched by others, as readers will discern.

When Master Liu Zhenchang was about to depart, he left instructions to be buried at the Turan Hall. After the funeral rites were completed, the Master returned to Yan. Through Academician Wei Bangyan, he entreated me to compose an account. Though I had long known his name, I had previously traveled to Changchun and met him in person. During our leisure, he asked me to write a preface for his *Record of Mount Hua*. I demurred, noting that Meng Jia of Longxi had already composed one, and later, the Elder Taiya of Lianfeng and Dharma Master Zhao, Lecturer of the Three Caverns, had further elucidated it. To add my words would be superfluous.

Yet, the Master’s lifelong reputation in the Dao only grew with age, and thus, I could not refrain from recording the broad outlines of his life. May later scholars trace his distant footsteps, and may those who chronicle the lives of eminent Daoists find here a reference.

Respectfully recorded in the *chimeng chifenruo* year, first month of spring, *dingyou* day.

*Postscript to The Record of Master Shi’s Daoist Conduct*
Composed by Li Daoqian of Yishan, styled Tianle of Junxi

The Dharma Master Dongxuan, Master Shi, I first met in his cloud-like brows at Mount Taihua in my youth. Later, we convened at Zhongnan, and again in Yan and the mountains. Over thirty years, our exchanges—whether in person or through letters—remained sparse yet profound. In the winter of *guiyou* in the *zhiyuan* era, the Master returned from Yan to Yuntai. The following autumn of *jiaxu*, in the seventh month, his immortal retinue arrived at Zhongnan. He tended the incense at the ancestral courtyard, then presented me with his *Celebration Chart of the Longchun Patriarch*, entrusting me to compose a preface and complete its omissions. Thus, I was privileged to join him in burning incense and discoursing on the Dao, sharing cups of wine and discussing literature, accompanying him for several months. By the first auspicious day of late winter, he repeatedly spoke of an imminent, prolonged farewell. Though I urged him to stay, he resolutely prepared to depart. This spring of *yihai*, I learned that on the fourth day of the first month, after entrusting his affairs to his disciples, he quietly passed like paper money offered to the spirits, his spirit journeying to the Pine and Chrysanthemum Hall where he once dwelled. He lived seventy-four springs and autumns.

Alas! How extraordinary! Since the *gengxu* year, the Master had received the command of the Teaching-Rectifying Perfected to wander the four directions, traversing distant lands for two full cycles of twelve years. He took as his duty the composition of scriptures and commentaries to uphold the Mystery Teaching, his lofty name resounding across the seas and his grand deeds spanning the realm. In his later years, he returned to his former hermitage, then departed like an immortal—truly a case of "man can magnify the Dao, and the Dao does not fail man."

On the winter solstice of this year, the Master’s disciple Liu Zhixin brought me the *Record of Master Shi’s Daoist Conduct*, composed by Academician Wang, Grand Master of the Hanlin, requesting that I append his later affairs. They intend to carve it in stone to ensure its immortality. As I, too, revere the Master’s attainment of the Dao, I gladly inscribe these words.

*Inscribed at the ancestral tomb of the Zhang family of Fushang, Tai’an*
*Composed by Du Renjie of Jinan*

At the southern slope of Mount Bu lies an estate called Fushang. Among the people of Fushang was the Zhang family, whose wealth in grain and property made them prominent in the village. During the Zhenglong era of the former Jin dynasty, when the population was dense and land scarce, many struggled to clothe and feed themselves—only the Zhangs possessed several dozen acres of fields and several head of cattle, yet they aided the distressed and succored the needy. Regardless of status, they lodged guests with equal hospitality, earning them the reputation of being true elders of the community.

The eldest son of the Zhang family, named Lin, once selected a new burial site about three *li* southwest of Fushang. The diviner Yin Tong personally oversaw the proceedings. Lin asked Tong, "What omens attend this burial?" Tong replied, "At the time of interment, a white hare arose from the *xun* direction and ran toward the *qian* position." Once the burial was complete, he continued, "Three generations hence, your family will produce an extraordinary figure—though you yourself shall not live to see it."

Lin begot Bin, who begot Xian, and from then on the lineage flourished. Xian had four sons: the eldest was Rong, the second Ping, the third Shan, and the fourth was still in the womb. His mother, née Liu, would cover her nose and retreat whenever she encountered meat or fish. On the day of her labor, she fell into a stupor, as if overcome by exhaustion, when someone cried out, "A reverend elder is at the gate—you must pay your respects!" She went out and saw a monk seated on a horse, who clasped his hands and said, "I must take a meal at your home." Upon waking, she gave birth to a son whose features were unlike those of an ordinary child. From infancy, he refused to consume meat or human milk—truly extraordinary.

At six, he studied as a child prodigy, reciting the Five Classics with ease, though he took no pleasure in remaining at home. At twelve, he left his parents to enter the mountains and study the Dao, taking the True and Serene Master Cui as his teacher. He received the dharma name Zhiwei and the sobriquet Master Tianni. His words and bearing were already on par with the great masters of old. Within a few years, his reputation as a Daoist adept resounded throughout the Qi and Lu regions.

At this time, the feudal lords of both east and west, though clad in martial attire, bowed their knees before him without exception. Duke Yanwu of Yanping, in his benevolence, appointed Fan Puzhao of Ninghai as abbot of Wanshou Shangqing Palace. Public opinion held that governing soldiers and civilians as the Duke did, and overseeing Daoist teachings as Puzhao did, were unparalleled feats—yet to truly perfect the administration of the palace, one needed a man of lofty integrity and capable judgment like Zhang Zhiwei as co-administrator. Only then would it suffice. After three petitions, Zhiwei finally consented.

Soon after his arrival, what had been abandoned was restored, what was incomplete was made whole, the indolent grew diligent, and the irreverent became respectful. All necessities were met without fail, and daily praise resounded. Later, he was memorialized to the court, which bestowed upon him the title *Chongzhen Baode Great Master*, granted him a purple robe adorned with golden trim, and rewarded his merit.

Thereupon, he brushed off his sleeves and returned to his former hermitage on Mount Bu. Occasionally, he would share a couch with his old friend Bi Qingqing to converse. One day, as they rested, he suddenly entered the western valley of Mount Tai, as if guided by an unseen presence. Passing the shrine of Yuanji the Duke, he arrived at Zhulin Temple, where pavilions and towers stood staggered as though suspended in the heavens. Four or five attendants followed—all strangers to him. Upon waking, he recounted this to Bi, who asked, "Did this truly happen?"

In the seventh month of that year, Duke Yanwu sent a letter summoning him, remarking that Tai’an Prefecture was the very site where ancient emperors and kings had performed their sacrifices. Yet its palaces, carriages, and temples—having survived the fires of kalpas—were now scarcely one in a hundred preserved. Such loss was deeply lamentable. As the Duke humbly governed this land, he felt compelled to restore them, for to neglect such duty would betray the proper reverence for the divine. He thus entreated the Master, whose profound Daoist cultivation he trusted, to oversee the project. The Master demurred, saying, "I am but a vegetable-eating Daoist of the empty mountains—how dare I undertake such a task?"

The Duke replied, "The labor of craftsmen, the cost of timber and stone, the expenses of pigments and cinnabar—I shall bear them all. Do not refuse." Zhiwei then assented. For over thirty years since, construction never ceased. The Jade Maiden Shrine atop the summit was rebuilt anew, its scale exceeding two-thirds of the original hall. A statue of white jade from the Eastern Sea, lifelike in form, was carved to match the hall’s dimensions. The Heavenly Gate, previously roofless, was now roofed. Below, the Huizhen Palace, the Jade Emperor Hall, the Sage Ancestor Hall, the abbot’s quarters, corridors, meditation halls, and kitchens—all were restored. Beyond these, the Daizong and Chaoyuan Temples were also expanded and repaired, each with meticulous care. Truly, it was a labor of great toil.

Yet the Master’s lodging, clothing, and meals were no better than those of a common laborer. Thus, the people, unmindful of their own exhaustion, fulfilled his vision—an achievement even the imperial court could not have matched so seamlessly. The authorities, upon hearing of this, bestowed upon him the title *Chongzhen Mingdao Yuanyong Great Master* and appointed him Supervisor of Daoist Affairs in Tai’an Prefecture.

In the fourth year of the Zhongtong era, the Chengming Perfected, abbot of the Great Everlasting Palace in the capital, dispatched an envoy bearing an imperial decree, commissioning the Master to oversee the renovation of the Eastern Peak Temple. Since my northward crossing in the renchen year, I had traveled to Fenghao for many years and, by fortunate coincidence, formed a close bond with the Master. We even shared a pact to grow old together on Mount Tai.

One day, he presented me with a record of his ancestral tombs, saying, "I dare not disrespect your wishes." Such was the Master—unassuming in manner, of average talent, and so gaunt it seemed his frame could scarcely bear his robes. Yet when questioned, there was nothing he did not know; when consulted, there was nothing he did not answer. His mind was vast as the mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru, or the bag encompassing the cosmos—mere metaphors could not capture even a fraction of its breadth.

To burden such a man with mere earth and timber was to utterly misunderstand him. Nevertheless, as the saying goes: "The love for one child brings blessings to the whole family; the enlightenment of one person elevates nine generations." Perhaps there is truth in this.

The earlier manifestations—the white hare’s apparition, the old monk’s entrusted transformation, and the spiritual journey to Mount Tai—have now been confirmed. Alas, it is clear indeed that he was an extraordinary man of the Zhang clan. When one day he sheds his mortal form and ascends as an immortal, should his disciples wish to record the broad outlines of his life, let this record of his ancestral tombs serve as testimony.

**The Life of Master Liu of Zhongnan**
Master Liu bore the surname Liu, with the personal name Zhiyuan and the Daoist appellation Qinglingzi. A native of Guxian in Xiangtai, he was born into a wealthy family. Having lost his father early, he and his two brothers lived under the care of their widowed mother. From childhood, the Master was uncommon, harboring a free and transcendent spirit. After his mother’s passing, he observed the three-year mourning period in full, then journeyed directly to Hongyang Mountain in Chan Prefecture, where he took the robe and entered the Dao under the guidance of Master Lang.

From that time, his mind grew ever clearer, and his resolve and conduct became sternly steadfast. He often traveled between the regions of Kai and Hua, his robes tattered and his feet calloused, enduring hardships others could not bear—yet he found joy in it. His elder brother, initially skeptical, once placed a bolt of fine silk by the roadside and hid to observe. The Master passed by without a glance, prompting his brother to marvel and thereafter hold him in deep respect.

During the Chongqing era, he journeyed east to Tiecha Mountain to pay homage to the Perfected One of Yuyang, from whom he received secret teachings. Soon after, the Jin throne collapsed, and the prefectures of Shandong turned to internecine slaughter. At the time, the Master was begging for alms in Xian’guo, where the terrain was elevated and a cavern beneath could shelter hundreds. When northern troops suddenly arrived, the local people fled into the cave, while the Master sat composed above. The raiders could do him no harm. For years, the region relied on him for survival, and the people still praise him to this day.

Later, the Master carved out a dwelling in a cliff at Mahua Terrace in Chanyuan, where, in the aftermath of war, wolves and jackals roamed the wilderness, devouring people by day. Yet he remained unshaken. Several wolves often lingered near his cave, tame and familiar, as if guarding him. As the old saying goes: *"Those who master the art of nurturing life leave tigers no place to set their claws, nor blades room to strike."* The Master embodied this.

In the winter of the *guiwei* year, Master Changchun received the imperial summons to journey south. The Master returned to Xuande, where Changchun, upon meeting him, immediately recognized his worth. He bestowed upon him a pair of shoes, instructing him not to walk barefoot, and appointed him Commissioner of Religious Affairs for the Daming Circuit. From then on, his reputation in the Dao flourished. He attracted hundreds of disciples and established over a hundred hermitages and temples.

In the *yiwei* year, the Perfected One of Qinghe made an offering at the ancestral court. The following year, upon returning to Yan, he summoned the Master and said: *"The Supreme Clarity Great Peace Palace on Zhongnan Mountain is where the Illustrious Perfected Lord revealed his sacred traces—a renowned temple of the Song dynasty. Since the chaos of war, it has fallen into ruin. Only one of great merit and deep karmic affinity can restore it. You shall take up this responsibility and assist in reviving the ancestral court."* The Master accepted the charge, gathered his disciples, and entered the Pass. Upon arrival, he cleared brambles, felled trees, and hired laborers. Within a few years, halls and corridors were restored to pristine splendor, and people near and far marveled in admiration.

Alas! Among those of the Mystic Gate, the Master may indeed be called one of merit.

In the autumn of the *guimao* year, on the twenty-third day of the ninth month, he composed a eulogy, shed his mortal form, and departed this life, having lived seventy-four years. He was interred south of the Zhongnan County city at Changchun Abbey.

In the *renzi* year, the Perfected Lord Li of Zhenchang, who presided over the teachings, made an offering at the ancestral court. By imperial decree, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Pure Virtue and Wondrous Attainment.

*The Stele Inscription of Master Zhao of Qingping’s Daoist Conduct*
Composed by Zhang Haogu, Preacher of Scriptures at the Ancestral Court of Great Chongyang’s Longevity Palace

The Perfect Dao may be summed up in a single word: *sincerity*.

Sincerity is the essence of reality. Surveying the perfected immortals from Ancestor Chongyang onward—whether they established abbeys to deliver people or upheld the lineage and propagated the teachings—all accumulated merit and amassed conduct so that their names endured without end. If not for sincerity and truth without falsehood, who could have achieved this? Master Zhao of Qingping was precisely such a one.

The Master’s personal name was Zhiyuan, and he hailed from Shanzhou. From childhood, his bearing was uncommon, and he was naturally inclined toward tranquility and simplicity.

In his twentieth year, both his parents passed away. Hearing of Master Ma, the Perfected Spirit of Tengzhou—a man of the Dao—he journeyed directly to seek him out, wishing to remain and study under his guidance. The Perfected Spirit subjected him to manifold trials, tempering his resolve with hardship. After prolonged refinement, he transmitted to him all the profound mechanisms and secret formulas. Thereafter, the Master bid farewell to Snowy Crag and traveled to Ninghai, where Yuanyang, upon first meeting him, esteemed him highly, and his reputation in the Dao grew daily.

During the Daan and Chongqing eras, the Master took refuge from war in Wangwu Mountain, subsisting on wild plants and tree bark, yet never wavering in his resolve. Later, learning that the Hebei region had stabilized, he journeyed through various lands to transform others through sincerity, and wherever he went, people admired him. In the guiwei year of the Great Yuan, when Master Changchun of the Long Spring lineage received an imperial summons to travel south, the Master hastened to Yanshan to pay his respects. Changchun singled him out for special praise and entrusted him with the cultivation of the Perfected Truth Abbey. Each day, the Master attended his teacher’s seat to listen and receive instruction, thus penetrating the mysteries of the ninefold transmutations and sevenfold returns, rooting and securing the foundation without doubt or hindrance.

After Changchun’s ascension, at the request of the officials and commoners of Luozhou, he assumed the abbacy of the Divine Radiance Longevity Palace. The Master responded to all things without attachment, and wherever he arrived, harmony prevailed. In the regions of Daming, Ci, and Xiang, he initiated several hundred disciples, establishing over ten hermitages and abbeys. Yet he remained modest and content in retreat, never presuming to claim the title of master.

In the yiwei year, when the Preceptor of Teachings, the Perfected of Pure Harmony, offered incense at the Ancestral Court, the Master also came to pay his respects. The following year, as Pure Harmony returned to Yan, he left the Master to serve as Supervisor. At that time, the Guanzhong region had just emerged from war, and famine loomed. The Daoist community at the Ancestral Court repeatedly considered dispersing, but the Master exhorted them with merit and conduct, transforming them through the principles of sin and fortune, guiding and encouraging them with expedient means, so that order was restored both within and without.

In the dingyou year, Pure Harmony sent a letter to the Master, saying: “The Huaqing Palace at Mount Li is an ancient site of immortals and sages, a place where the state has long revered and sought blessings. If not for a seasoned elder like yourself, who could take charge? Your years are deep in the Dao, and you have rendered great service to the teaching. You may assume the responsibility of overseeing its restoration.” Thereupon, he bestowed upon him the title of Grand Master of Pure Emptiness.

Having received this commission, the Master led his disciples to clear the brambles, repair the halls, and adorn them with cinnabar and pigments, renewing them entirely. He also established the Encountering Immortals Abbey in Caicun on Mount Zhongnan to complement the sacred sites of the Ancestral Court. Other hermitages and halls arose wherever he went.

In the xinchu year, after attending the interment of the Ancestral Master, he returned to Chuzhou. In the guimao year, the main hall of the Divine Radiance Palace was completed, and auspicious signs descended from heaven. Though all offered congratulations, the Master did not regard it as extraordinary.

Earlier, during his time at the Ancestral Court, the Master had formed a close friendship with Master Liu of Pure Coolness. That winter, a disciple of Pure Coolness arrived from Weifu, reporting that his master had returned to the True on the twenty-third day of the ninth month at Mount Zhongnan. On the first day of the last month of winter, the Master set out for Weifu to offer a distant libation. That evening, lodging in Guangping, he suddenly sighed and said: “Observing the transformations of things, I did not realize that transformation had come to me as well.” He immediately returned to the abbey and summoned his disciples, saying: “Last night, the Perfected One commanded me to hasten back to the Ancestral Court. I am about to depart.” Thereupon, he entrusted his final affairs to Zhang Zhijing, took up brush and paper, and left this verse:

*Cultivation’s true aim lies in effort,*
*Refined cinnabar needs no furnace.*
*With a wave of the hand, I return to the clouded path,*
*Where the high heavens’ wind and moon remain ever thus.*

Setting down the brush, he transformed. It was the third day of the month. He was seventy-seven years old. He was interred in the abbey south of the prefectural city.

Forty-six years later, in the wuzi spring of the Zhiyuan era, Li Zhitong, Supervisor of the Huaqing Palace; Yang Zhisu, Venerable of the Encountering Immortals Abbey; and Su Daochang, Director, along with others, presented the Master’s lineage to Preacher Lü Zhizhen as an intermediary. Bearing a written account, they came to request an inscription, saying: “Our ancestor, the Elder of Pure Clarity, has rested in Chuzhou for many years. Though his disciples in Shaanxi have established shrines and enshrined his image to maintain seasonal offerings—never allowing them to cease—no stele has yet been erected to record his conduct. Could this not be a failing of our dullness? We humbly prostrate ourselves to request an inscription.”

I replied that an inscription serves to record virtue, and the Master’s virtue is indeed worthy of inscription. For the Master was a man of purity and sincerity, whose inner cultivation became virtue and conduct, and whose outward actions became deeds. Throughout his life, in all his comings and goings, he never harbored the slightest trace of self-serving compromise. From this perspective, he is truly deserving of inscription. As for the apparitions of cranes during his rituals in Deng and E, the wanderings of his spirit in Jingzhao at the time of his passing, the preservation of his countenance after reburial, and the distant arrival of cinnabar youths during his memorial services—such marvels were manifold. Yet these all arose naturally and were not the Master’s original intent. Thus, I have simply outlined the broad contours of his life in this inscription.

The inscription reads:

*Great indeed is the Perfect Dao, formless in its inception,*
*Yet harboring wondrous efficacy, to be magnified by man.*
*Chongyang shouldered the burden of primordial times,*
*Disseminating transformation solely under the name of Perfect Truth.*
*The host of immortals, blessings for the age, succeeded one another,*
*Upholding the lineage and propagating the teaching, the teaching flourished.*
*Then there was one called Pure Clarity,*
*Whose good roots were planted of old, pure and refined.*
*In youth, he studied the Dao and already bore renown,*
*Meeting Changchun again, his heart grew ever clearer.*
*His inner elixir nurtured, he dwelt in Ci and Luo,*
*Disciples thronged ceaselessly to his gate.*
*He brushed his robes and journeyed to Guanzhong,*
*Pure Harmony, upon seeing him, called him seasoned.*
*The Huaqing, long in ruins, was entrusted to his leadership,*
*As he transformed rubble into cinnabar and azure.*
*The Encountering Immortals he founded, personally overseeing its construction,*
*To this day, its splendor illuminates the Ancestral Court.*
*His work accomplished, he returned east and swiftly ascended,*
*Riding the wind and driving the qi, how serene!*
*The Master’s name stands peerless,*
*The Master’s conduct pure in its sincerity.*
*This inscription I compose is no empty praise,*
*May it serve as enduring testimony for those to come.*

Record of the Affairs of the Perfected of Knowing Constancy.

The Master’s surname was Ji, given name Yi, courtesy name Fuzhi, a native of Gaoping County in Zezhou. His lineage descended from the Yong clan of Chang’an during the Tang, known for their filial piety and harmonious virtue. His grandfather, Prefect Yong of the former Mianzhou, had once held office in the county, and thus the family settled there. By the reign of Emperor Shizong of Jin, they changed their surname to Ji to avoid the imperial taboo.

At the Master’s birth, his mother dreamed of an immortal presenting her with a jade stone, which she swallowed upon waking—thereafter conceiving him. From childhood, the Master was refined and solemn; those who knew him recognized his extraordinary nature. At four, he began studying books; at nine, he lost both parents. By thirteen, he could compose poetry and prose, and upon reaching adulthood, he had mastered astronomy, geography, yin-yang, and the arts of calendrical calculation.

In the year *xinsi*, the imperial armies swept through Hebei and Ze, and half the populace was taken captive. The Master, alone and destitute, wandered in exile to Nangong in Jizhou. In the year *jiawu*, Perfected Wang of Dwelling Clouds expounded the teachings across the land, passing through the region. The Master, upon a single exchange, found resonance and became his disciple, receiving the name Zhizhen and the sobriquet Knowing Constancy. Thereafter, he followed his master to Mount Pan, where he cultivated true serenity and nurtured the vastness of the primordial qi, earning his master’s approval.

In the year *renzi*, Perfected Li of True Constancy, the presiding master, established the Academy of Mysteries at the Great Everlasting Spring Palace in Yanjing. The Master was among those summoned, and daily, he and the virtuous masters of the four directions alternated in presiding over the teaching seat, guiding many later scholars to advancement.

In the spring of *jiayin*, Dwelling Clouds arrived in Yanjing to conduct the All-Under-Heaven Offering. Upon its conclusion, he took the Master back to Bianliang, where they resided at the Palace of Facing the Primordial. Soon after, Dwelling Clouds ascended in realization, and the Master succeeded him in overseeing the teachings.

In the second month of spring in the year *dingmao* of the Zhiyuan era, the Sagely Emperor issued an edict: *"Ji Zhizhen’s virtue is steadfast and upright, his learning rich and abundant. His explanations of the *Book of Changes* are direct and penetrating, his grasp of the Dao profound and comprehensive. Early on, he studied the myriad longevity practices on Mount Pan; later, he presided over the Court of the Primordial by the Bian River. His long-renowned conduct merits prior commendation—let him be specially granted the title Perfected of Cultivated Virtue and Profound Constancy. May he embody the imperial decree and forever pray for the nation’s longevity."*

The following year, on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, the Master manifested a slight illness and passed away at the age of seventy-six. His writings, including the *Cloud Mountain Collection*, the *Comprehensive Chapters on the Dao and Its Virtue*, and the *Direct Explanations of the Zhou Changes*, circulate in the world.

*Record of the Conduct of Master Zhao of Yan’an*
*Composed by Zhang Zixian, Court Gentleman for Ceremonial, Acting Prefect of Yan’an, granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag*

What enables one to attain great freedom is the thorough understanding of life and death, past and future, without attachment or stagnation. Of old, Liezi rode the wind and traveled, his mastery serene—yet Master Zhuang of Nanhua deemed him still dependent. As for one who rides the rectitude of heaven and earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless, what does he depend upon? The Master of Yan’an, Zhao, is such a man of no dependence.

The Master’s given name was Baoyuan, his Daoist name Returning to the Primordial, and he was commonly called Mage. A native of Yingchuan in Yan’an, his family had long tilled the land and accumulated hidden virtue. From youth, the Master was extraordinary, his aspirations set beyond the mundane. Once, he encountered a man of the Dao who told him: *"You possess deep karmic roots from past goodness. I now transmit to you a secret method—diligently cultivate it, and you will surely attain accomplishment."* Thereupon, he built a hermitage to dwell in. He served his mother with utmost filial piety, and his village praised him.

Later, at the recommendation of his master Dai Bogao, he was introduced to the presence of Perfected Liu, where he received the transmission of the mind-seal. He then retreated to Yangshan, remaining secluded for a full twelve-year cycle without emerging.

Though the Master had never studied books, one day he dreamed that the Perfected Lord summoned him and offered a banquet of gold, which he declined. Instead, the Perfected Lord presented him with the two *Pian* of the *Dao* and *Virtue*, and the Master swallowed them whole. From that moment, his celestial nature grew luminous, his mind opened and expanded, and he heard what he had never heard, knew what he had never known. Poetry and songs flowed from him like a gushing spring. He composed a song that said:

*Yesterday before the hermitage, I met Zhuang and Lie,*
*Two men imparted to me the secret of long life.*

And another:

*Seeking a kindred spirit, I find none,*
*A rustic wanders alone down the Qin River.*

Thereupon, he journeyed to Mount Zhongnan to study under Ancestral Master Chongyang, where he received profound revelations of the esoteric mysteries.

Afterward, he wandered through famous mountains and sacred sites, carefree and unconstrained, finding solace in poetry and wine. He styled himself a disciple of the Most High. In his later years, he returned to his hometown and took residence at Yingxiang Abbey.

In the fifth year of the Taihe era, Daoist friends from Ganquan County earnestly invited the Master to reside in their hermitage. In response, he composed the lyric *Wumeng Ling*, its closing lines reading:

*Parting, parting,*
*Next year at the vernal equinox.*

At the time, no one understood his meaning. Soon after, on the fourth day of the second month of the following year, two imperial envoys bearing court robes and a summons arrived to escort the Master to the capital. The Master firmly declined, saying, *"I am but an old rustic—how could I undertake such a journey?"* The envoys insisted he set out. The Master then spoke to his Daoist friend Dang Zhen and his disciples: *"I must now withdraw."* He bathed, donned his proper robes, and sat upright. At the third watch, a lightning flash filled the room, and a thunderous sound shook the air. All present were terrified and rushed to see—only to find the Master had passed away in perfect composure. He left behind a verse:

*A crane on the pine’s tip turns toward the wind,*
*Only the heart that soars through clouds returns.*
*Ten thousand miles of azure sky, a sheet of snow—*
*Seek it all you will on the marble pillar’s head.*

That very night marked the vernal equinox, confirming the words of his earlier lyric. He was seventy-two years old.

Throughout his life, the Master composed works that were compiled into the *Hun Cheng Pian*, transmitted to the world.

Alas! When the Master nurtured his vastness on Yangshan for twelve years without emerging, was this not harnessing the transformations of the six *qi*? Forsaking the honor of imperial summons to shed his mortal form and ascend in flight—was this not riding the purity of heaven and earth? Was he not indeed a man of no dependence, coming and going freely, attaining perfect ease?

Thus I say: the reason one attains great freedom is through comprehending that life and death, coming and going, are without obstruction. How can this not be true?

After the Master’s passing, the envoys painted his true likeness to fulfill the imperial command, only to find he had already departed for the court. They reported the events in full, and the court was struck with awe. Another envoy, Ma Jinzhang, was dispatched with funeral gifts. Together with the local officials, they selected a site west of Yingxiang Abbey, carved a stone grotto, and interred him with a lofty coffin and rich burial. A shrine was built, a stele erected, to honor his immortal traces, ensuring offerings of incense in all four seasons.

The envoys requested that I compose this record to preserve his memory for posterity. Though I know my own inadequacy, how could I dare refuse their command? Moreover, though I draw sustenance from the court, I could not defy the envoys’ request. And in reverence for the Master’s lofty virtue—regretting that I could not meet him—I now take up my brush to set down these true events.

**Epitaph of the Vacuous and Tranquil Master of the Cavernous Origin, Shen Gong, Supervisor of the Tomb**
*Composed by Zhang Haogu of Jian’an*

The Master’s name was Zhizhen, his courtesy name Zhengzhi, a native of Gaoping County in Zezhou. As a youth, he studied the classics and passed the prefectural examination for scholars, but later, while residing in Taiyuan, he abandoned his pursuit of official rank and donned Daoist robes.

Initially, he traveled with Master Chaoran, Wang Jun. Later, he resided at the Great Everlasting Palace in Yanjing, where he took Perfected Li Zhenchang as his teacher. Perfected Zhenchang held him in high regard and bestowed upon him the name *Master of the Cavernous Origin*, presenting him with a poem that read:

*With unwavering resolve, guard your integrity,*
*Your work beyond the dust may yet be fulfilled.*

At the time, Master Wang Shuzhai and Academician Zhang Na’an, men of great talent and learning, were residing in the Daoist abbey. In his leisure, the Master attended their lectures, and thus his virtue advanced daily, and his reputation grew.

In the *gengzi* year, Perfected Zhenchang entrusted him with the affairs of the abbey’s gates, praising his competence. In the *jiachen* year, Envoy Pei Tianmin, bearing imperial decrees and incense for the sacred sites, appointed the Master as his assistant. Upon returning to Yanjing, he was promoted to *Keeper of the Abbey Gates*, a mark of imperial favor.

In the *wushen* year, the Perfected One, by imperial grace, bestowed upon him a purple robe and elevated him to *Supervisor of the Abbey Gates*. In the *xinhai* year, he was dispatched by imperial decree to perform rites at the Eastern Sacred Peak. Upon completion, he cast a petition into the Dragon Pool, where extraordinary signs manifested.

In the *jiayin* year, he accompanied the Perfected One to perform the border sacrifices at the sacred mountains and rivers. The following year, he again accompanied the Perfected One to the northern audience. The year after, the Perfected One passed away, and the *Sincere and Illuminated* succeeded to the teaching. He appointed the Master to oversee the affairs of the Purple Tenuity Abbey atop the Heavenly Altar, whereupon the Master styled himself *Cloud Elder*, wandering freely among the mountains and forests, as if to spend his remaining years there.

In the *rentu* year of the Zhongtong era, the Prince of Yongning’s residence, having long heard of his Daoist reputation, specially bestowed upon him the title *Vacuous and Tranquil Master of the Cavernous Origin*. In the fourth year of the Zhiyuan era, *dingmao*, the Tianqing Abbey in Taiyuan earnestly invited him to preside as master of the abbey.

In the winter of the seventh year, the *Sincere and Illuminated* repeatedly summoned him to his hall, and shortly thereafter, the *Sincere and Illuminated* ascended. The *Pure and Harmonious* Perfected One then compelled him to serve as *General Supervisor of Daoist Teachings*. Unable to refuse, he arose, but soon after, dragging his staff, he fled south, passing through Bing and Fen, resting in Hezhong. Wherever he went, many sought to retain him.

In the *renwu* year, he journeyed west to the ancestral abbey, renovating the Everlasting Spring Abbey in Chuan Village on Mount Zhongnan, intending it as his place of retirement. Suddenly, afflicted by a minor illness, he passed away in perfect alignment, at the age of seventy-five, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month in the *jiashen* year.

The Master was of refined and dignified appearance, with a magnanimous bearing and far-reaching insight. Those with whom he associated were all eminent scholars and renowned figures. Though the *Perfected of True Constancy* oversaw the teachings, he entrusted all matters to the Master, who in turn took the support and advancement of the Mysterious Teachings as his own duty. Even when journeying to court audiences or traveling across the perilous tens of thousands of *li* beyond the Yin Mountains, he never once regarded hardship or toil as a concern. When others expressed surprise, he would say: *"Would I do this for any but the Gate of the Mysterious?"* During his time in Yan, he never ceased his efforts for the ancestral abbey, for he sought to repay its foundational grace.

Throughout his life, he never wavered in his convictions, so that neither gain nor loss, fortune nor misfortune, could disturb his heart. In leisure, he would place a zither to his left and books to his right, finding contentment in his own joy. He was also skilled in receiving guests, and regardless of their status—whether noble or humble, elder or youth—none failed to leave with a sense of reverence. Yet upon examining his conduct, all was in accord with principle; his words were only truthful speech, devoid of even the slightest trace of greed or deceit. Compared to the ancients, he may indeed stand without shame.

After his passing, his disciple Lu Zhixing compiled his poems and prose into sixteen volumes, entitled *The Huze Mengzhai Collection*, which circulated in the world. One day, Zhixing presented a formal request for an epitaph. Though I initially declined, the *Perfected of Heavenly Music* also urged me, saying: *"This elder gave his utmost for the Teachings—you must inscribe his tomb without refusal."* I replied: *"Very well."* Thus, I composed and inscribed this eulogy.

**Epitaph:**

Alas, Master Shen!
His qi vast and unyielding,
his deeds worthy of emulation,
his words measured and refined.

Those who followed me, he guarded with Dao and virtue;
those who opposed me, he left to Heaven—gain and loss alike dissolved.
Was such a man one to exhaust his strength for the Mystic Gate,
only to nurse grievances beside the Celestial Throne?
I know him as one who grasped all he possessed,
rode all he encountered,
sojourned in the world,
and at last returned to his true home.

*This concludes Scroll Eight of the* Record of the Sweetwater Immortal Source.

**Scroll Nine of the** *Record of the Sweetwater Immortal Source*
**Compiled by Li Daoqian, the Heavenly Joy Daoist of Yimen**

**Stele Inscription for the Restoration of the Zhidao Abbey in Qin Crossing, Hu County**
**Composed by Yu Yingmao, the Recluse of Snow Creek, Former Professor of Ezhou**

Our Patriarch Chongyang, who established the Quanzhen teachings, was none other than the True of the Wuji, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoined and congealed—thus the origin of all virtues.

That he is hailed as the Patriarch of Patriarchs is because when the Dao of the master is established, good people abound; when good people abound, the court is rectified and the realm is governed.

The substance of the Dao is vast without boundary, minute without interior; its function pervades all things at all times. It does not persist because of Yao, nor perish because of Jie; it is not deficient for the foolish, nor excessive for the worthy. Why? Because the primordial qi spreads and bestows: yang hardens it, yin softens it; wood, metal, water, and fire array it. This is qi—what humans receive to become human.

The Supreme Polarity is a vast expanse: dynamic in its movement, compliant in its establishment; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom serve as its guiding principles. This is principle—what humans receive to embody the Dao.

As Qian the Father and Kun the Mother, Heaven and Earth endowed humans with the completeness of the Five Natures and the authenticity of principle. Yet humans fail to preserve this authenticity: either desires usurp it, or violence seizes it; either fame and profit muddle it, or anger and craving destroy it. When this authenticity cannot be preserved, the world ought to lack good people; without good people, how can the state be governed, how can the realm be pacified?

Only those who preserve the authenticity of this Dao may serve as teachers to emperors and kings, as models for later generations. When extended and practiced, it transforms customs into purity and simplicity; when spiritually enacted, it eradicates the winds of fame-seeking and profit-chasing.

Ziyun (Yang Xiong) obscured this truth, hence his disgrace under Wang Mang and his plunge from the tower. Zifang (Zhang Liang) grasped it, hence his success as a minister of Han and his wanderings with Red Pine.

This Dao precedes Heaven yet Heaven does not oppose it; it follows Heaven yet accords with Heaven’s timing. Cultivating it brings fortune; defying it brings misfortune—this is no deception.

When the Yellow Emperor studied this Dao under Guangcheng, he governed the realm by merely adjusting his robes. Shun, inheriting Yao’s realm, studied this Dao under Chaoxu and brought peace to the myriad states. Wuding learned this Dao from Gan Pan, reviving the Shang dynasty.

If the person is unworthy, the Dao does not manifest in vain.

Moreover, the Supreme Mystery and Primordial One (Laozi) lived during the Three Dynasties, once serving as Archivist of the Zhou. Witnessing the decline of the Zhou’s Dao, he could not enact his principles, so he composed the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* to bequeath to later ages. Therein he declares the Dao’s greatness and proclaims that kings emulate the vastness of Heaven and Earth—surely this aligns with the single kingly model of our Master (Confucius).

The True Man of Nanhua (Zhuangzi) lived during the Warring States, once serving as a lacquer garden official. Seeing the world embroiled in strife, he could not realize his aspirations, so he embedded his teachings in the Dao to instruct others: the *Yi* elucidates the Dao of yin and yang; the *Spring and Autumn* clarifies the Dao of names and duties. Thus, his intent harmonized with our Master’s reverence for kingship.

By the Western Han, the Four Hoary Ones employed this Dao to secure the state’s foundation with a single word. In the Eastern Han, Yan Guang (Yan Ziling) aligned with this Dao to befriend the restorer of the dynasty. Through the Jin, Song, Qi, and Liang dynasties, across the Tang and into the Song, though the times were not ancient, this Dao endured. Figures like Xu Jianyang, Ge Goulou, Tao Yinju, Kou Qianzhi, Sima Ziwei, Shu Hua, Zhengyang, Chunyang, and Master Hide (Chen Tuan) skillfully extended the authenticity they preserved to the rulers of their day.

Of these, Zhengyang and Chunyang were masters of unfathomable yin-yang transformations, their presence still manifest across the world. Thus, Patriarch Chongyang was able to inherit the orthodox transmission of this Dao and fully realize its wondrous principles.

The Master was originally from Liquan, surnamed Wang. During the early years of the Jin dynasty, he passed the imperial examinations, ranking among the top scholars. Tall and imposing, endowed with a noble bearing, his square pupils gleamed, his beard luxuriant. Yet the Dao clashed with the times, so he did not allow carriages and caps or wealth and rank to entangle his heart. Instead, he delighted in waters, bamboo, mist, and clouds, choosing to dwell in Liujiang on Mount Zhongnan.

One day, he encountered Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin at Gan River, who transmitted to him the wondrous oral instructions of this Dao. He took "Chongyang" as his sobriquet and "Jia" as his name, planting a crabapple tree at each corner of his dwelling.

Later, he took up his staff and departed the Pass, returning eastward to the sea. When asked his purpose, he replied, "I am off to Qiu, Liu, and Tan to catch a horse." None understood his meaning.

Soon after, seven disciples followed him, four of whom attended him closely: Ma Yu, Tan Chuduan, Liu Chuxuan, and Qiu Chuji. He named Ma "Danyang," Tan "Changzhen," Liu "Changsheng," and Qiu "Changchun."

Returning west to Bian, he suddenly told his disciples: "I dare not break my appointment with Donghua, Zhongli, and Lü. My posthumous affairs rest with Liujiang. The Quanzhen teachings—you must strive to uphold them." Having spoken, he bathed, and suddenly passed away.

The eminent officials, great ministers, and worthy scholar-officials of Bian all came to mourn. Thereafter, the Four Masters bore his immortal palanquin into Guanzhong, interring him in Liujiang as he had willed.

As the rites concluded and they prepared to return, the Four Masters rested beneath the luxuriant trees of the Zhenwu Hall in Qin渡 Town. Still lingering in sorrowful longing for their teacher, they clasped hands at parting, each declaring his resolve to follow the Way—none failing the Ancestral Master’s charge. Changchun secluded himself in the Fan Stream of Taigong; Changsheng dwelt by the Chan Waters of Eastern Zhou; Changzhen resided south of the river at Chaoyuan. Only Danyang returned to build his abode at the field, which became the present-day Chongyang Wanshou Palace of Zhongnan.

From this time, the Quanzhen teachings gradually flourished, and the virtue of its patriarchs grew ever more illustrious. During the Xingding era, those who admired the Four Perfected Ones erected halls at the Zhenwu Hall to enshrine incense and offerings. By imperial grace, it was bestowed the name Zhidao Abbey. Yet as the Jin dynasty neared its end and the people grew violent, the abbey was reduced to ashes.

Reverently considering the sagely and martial reign of the Great Yuan, which embraced the Four Seas, pacifying the people and reviving all that had fallen into decay, only the ruins of Zhidao remained, overgrown with brambles and choked with smoke. One day, the Perfected Master Yu of Dongzhen passed through Qin渡 and beheld the old foundation. Stirred by emotions akin to Yu’s longing for the rivers and hills or the sight of Yao’s distant tomb, he commanded his disciple Luo Zhitong to gather craftsmen and materials, construct halls, assemble disciples, and restore the Ancestral Master’s legacy while amplifying the winds of the Mysterious Teachings. Thus, the virtue and deeds of the One Patriarch and Four Masters became an enduring foundation—was this not magnificent?

In my leisure, I wandered among the jade halls, perusing the records inscribed on stone tablets, yet found them often at odds with the essence of the Dao. One day, Zhitong presented the deeds of the Four Perfected Ones, entreating me to compose a record. I have observed that the Grand Historian’s account of the Nine Schools places Confucianism and Daoism above all others. Dao and Confucianism share a single principle; Confucianism and Dao share a single mechanism. Mastering their transformations, the world knows no flawed systems; clinging to fixed methods, the world knows no perfect teachings. Without a mind attuned to the subtleties of the Dao, one cannot discourse on this.

Yet the teachings in the world—what fixed master do they have? That this school is named "Quanzhen" (Perfect Realization) is none other than the truthful, unerring principle of our Confucians. Its refinement of form and cultivation of nature—are these not the profound mysteries of the *Book of Changes*, which exhausts the divine and knows transformation? When they escorted the Ancestral Master’s coffin and fulfilled his burial, some high disciples inherited his will and continued his work, while others dwelt by his tomb. At that time, how was this different from the disciples of our Master Confucius, who, upon his passing, prepared to return home, weeping as they faced one another?

Later, when Master Changchun was summoned to the northern court, his virtue of cherishing life moved the sovereign, turning the tide of execution in a single moment. How was this different from Mencius admonishing a ruler of his time that one who does not delight in killing can unify the world? From this, we see that the Dao cultivated by the Ancestral Master and the will inherited by his successors could serve as models for emperors and bring about the world’s peace and order. Far from the miscellaneous arts of the fangshi of Qin and Han, or the likes of Chen Men, He Sun, Chang Ju, and Jie Ni, today we witness the unity of script, the uniformity of carriage tracks, and the tranquility of the realm under a government pure and solemn. Only then do we realize that the planting of the crabapple tree was no false omen for its forebear, and the deeds of Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma have been validated in posterity.

Ah! This Dao—from the perspective of ordinary sentiment, it seems wondrous and unfathomable, yet from the standpoint of the perfected, its guardianship never strays from the principle of the One True. Thus, though the Quanzhen teachings transcend the world and stand alone, their reverence for the sovereign and devotion to superiors remain constant. Though they wander in seclusion, their benevolence toward others and benefit to all things grow ever more earnest. Through sincerity in non-action and non-thought, they manifest the principle of responsiveness to stimuli. The patriarchs, with divine foresight of the future and wisdom concealing the past, and their disciples, inheriting their will and continuing their work—how could this not benefit the sagely and enlightened court? Without devotion to the Dao, who could partake in this?

Thus, I offer this eulogy:
The body of the Dao is vast and boundless, without scent or sound.
When yin and yang first divided, they formed images and shapes.
Hidden and submerged, they rise and fall across the eight directions—
Only humans are noble, the spirits of all things.
Tracing beginnings and ends, we know life and death.
Sunk in the torrent of desires, the heart’s ebb and flow are unfathomable.
The succession of immortals seeks only to preserve the True of the boundless—
Had Chongyang not awakened first, who would have revealed the wondrous principle to us?
The guiding principles of the Dao exalt the essence of the Two and Five.
Aspiring to restore the ancient Way, it shines anew.
The Perfected abide forever, their Dao complete and virtue pure.
One Patriarch and Four Masters span ten thousand ages in eternal spring.

At the White Cloud Abbey in Yanjing, the *Chushun Hall Funeral Record*
Composed by the Recluse of Stillness and Penetration, Chen Shike

After the Great Patriarch Changchun ascended as an immortal, his successor, Master Yin, transformed the eastern residence of his official quarters into an abbey named White Cloud, laying the groundwork for the funeral rites. The following year, on the first day of the third month, he summoned his disciples and said: "Our Father-Master’s coffin rests in Baoguang, yet it is not at peace. I intend to select a site at White Cloud, build a hall upon it, and inter him there—what say you?" Some replied: "The labor is no small matter, and our provisions are insufficient. It cannot easily be done." Master Yin said: "If we act with filial devotion to repay his virtue, what fear is there of failure? Moreover, our Father-Master’s legacy lives in the people, and disciples from all directions will surely yearn to follow. There will be those who aid us—do not doubt. Even if not, we may use the abbey’s resources to cover the costs, each carrying but a single gourd."

Thus, he summoned all his followers, and on the *dingwei* day of the fourth month, they cleared the land and laid the foundation. Four days later, on *gengxu*, hundreds of devotees from the eastern road of the Central River arrived, bearing provisions to assist. In forty days, the hall was completed. Its design was grand and magnificent, and it was named "Abiding in Harmony." After the ritual of the first anniversary, the immortal remains were interred, the details of which are recorded in the stele of his deeds. One day, he asked me to compose a separate account, intending to inscribe the names of all those who attended the funeral from various regions on the reverse of the stele, thereby magnifying the occasion.

I agreed, but one who laughed and questioned me said: "When Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said, 'I shall take heaven and earth as my coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts—are not my burial furnishings already complete?' His disciples said, 'We fear the crows and kites will devour you.' He replied, 'Above, I shall be food for crows and kites; below, for ants and mole crickets. Why rob one to feed the other—how partial you are!'

When Laozi died, Qin Yi mourned him, wailing thrice before departing. He said, 'Just now, the Master came in due time; now he departs in accord with the Way. To abide in due time and follow the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter—this is what the ancients called the 'suspended release of the Emperor.' The Daoist school follows Laozi’s teachings. Yet now, the disciples of Master Changchun name their hall 'Abiding in Harmony,' while on the day of their master’s return to the True, they clamorously prepare the craftsmen’s work and wail in grief, their sorrow so profound. When it came to the burial, they spared no effort in its rites, with over ten thousand Daoists and laypeople gathering from all directions. Officials even provided armored guards—such extravagance! Is this the intent of Laozi and Zhuangzi?"

I replied: "Master Changchun’s 'suspended release' regarded life and death as but a fleeting dream—how could he have expected such things? Yet his disciples, bearing the debt of their master’s kindness, could do no otherwise. Moreover, do you understand the distinction between principle and practice? To forget sorrow and joy, to transcend the body—this is principle, how the sages beyond the world conduct themselves. But to honor the dead and cherish the distant—this is practice, the ritual of the human realm. If one clings to principle and neglects practice, can this be called true attainment?

I am but a scholar; let me speak to you of the Way of Confucius and Mencius. The *Book of Changes* says: 'The ancients buried their dead with thick layers of firewood, interring them in the wilds without mounds or trees, and without fixed mourning periods. Later sages replaced this with coffins and outer coffins, drawing from the hexagram *Great Exceeding*, desiring that it be greatly excessive and abundant.' Mencius records: 'When Confucius died, after three years, his disciples prepared to return home. They entered to bow to Zigong, wept facing one another, and only departed after losing their voices. Zigong returned, built a hut by the grave, and lived there alone for another three years before leaving.' He did not forget Confucius.

Now, those who studied under Master Changchun have learned his Way. If they do not bury their master as meagerly as the Mohists, but instead honor his passing and cherish his memory like Zigong and his fellows, what harm is there in attaining enlightenment? If you claim that weeping harms the Dao, have you never laughed? Yet laughter and weeping are both forms of joy—why is laughter alone unharmful?

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: 'Before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are aroused, it is called the Mean. When aroused and all in due measure, it is called Harmony. The Mean is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal Way.' If sorrow and joy are in due measure, what harm is there to the Dao?"

The one who questioned me was thus silenced. I recorded these events and also composed a poem for his disciples to sing in offering to their master, to express their profound remembrance and his boundless virtue. The verses read:

The Master rides the clouds to the Emperor’s realm,
Shedding his immortal bones, leaving behind Baoguang.
Now to bury him, the jade coffin is opened—
His countenance as in life, his form intact,
His robes renewed, his cap made new.

What is known of him shall never perish,
What is unknown is his undying longevity.
The Master in heaven surveys the mortal world,
Where his hall stands, wheel-worn yet a place to wander and rest.
The Master pities our toil and returns from time to time,
Riding phoenix and simurgh, neither whip nor lash.

At the house, mountains rise; at the gate, winds ripple.
Where his staff and sandals passed, one may yet glimpse him.
He drinks with us, he blesses us,
Offering coarse fare, tending the incense and flame.

The Mysterious Gate’s teachings the Master expanded,
The state reveres them, descendants uphold them.
We repay his virtue, and those who come after shall not cease,
Morning rites and evening audiences—we honor him as if he were present.

*Record of Qingzhen Abbey in Huaizhou*
By Yuan Haowen of Xinxing

The Qingzhen Abbey of Xiuwu stands north of the county seat, founded by the Quanzhen adepts at the behest of Master Qiu the Perpetual Spring. In the early years of the Dading era, Master Qiu journeyed from Donglai into the Pass, secluding himself for over a decade at Fan Brook without emerging. The realm regarded him as a man of the Dao. When the Xing Mausoleum summoned him to court, he passed through Shanyang and, enamored of its scenic beauty, lingered long, remarking to his disciples: "Among our abbeys, the one in Wu Pass ranks foremost, followed by Bin Du, then Sacred Waters. If you could dwell here, you would rival Bin Du and Sacred Waters." The disciples then petitioned the local magnate Ma Zi’an for land and obtained it. Over the years, they built dwellings, which gradually took form. Nearby, a great spring welled forth, irrigating a thousand *mu* of fields where rice surpassed that of Lotus Marsh. To the east, it bordered Su Gate, where dense forests and towering bamboo groves abounded. The peaks of Mount Taihang rose sheer as thousand-*ren* walls, their clouds and mists at dawn and dusk leaving visitors no respite for greeting or farewell. According to local gazetteers, this was the very place where the worthies of Jin delighted and forgot to return.

In the early Daan era, the abbey was granted its present name by imperial favor. Master Qiu dispatched his eminent disciple Liu Zhiming to reside there, gathering followers numbering a hundred. During the Gengchen year of the Xingding era, the abbey was destroyed by war. In the Xinmao year of the Zhengda era, Leng Deming, a disciple of Zhiming, restored it, and today its residents number a thousand souls.

While I was detained in Liaocheng on my way from Daliang, Leng Deming’s dharma-brother Fang Zhiqi, through the mediation of the prefectural aides Qi Wenju, Lang Wenbing, and Zhao Shangbin, entreated me to compose this record. Leng and Fang, both of pure and lofty conduct, delighted in my company, so I have set these events in order and appended my reflections.

Since the calamity of the Central Realm’s submergence, only the Quanzhen Dao has endured. Let me venture to speak of it: the Sage’s concern for posterity ran deep, so he established the four occupations, the three bonds and five constants. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each had their calling; fathers were kind, sons filial, elder brothers friendly, younger brothers respectful; rulers were revered, husbands and wives harmonious, each with their proper duties. The Minister of Education oversaw the nine ranks. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—statutes, laws, and institutions—were upheld together with the literati. The people of the realm tilled to eat, wove to clothe, cared for the living and buried the dead without regret. All was ordered and cultured, indebted to the Sage’s teachings. Like hunger demanding food or cold demanding clothing, from the self to the family, from the family to the realm’s four quarters, it was inseparable even for a moment, enduring unchanged for a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand generations. This is what is meant by *teaching*, and the Dao abides therein.

As the tradition holds: "Heaven blesses the people below, appointing rulers and teachers for them." Whether the Dao is practiced or not depends on Heaven. Today, the office of Minister of Education and the scholar’s vocation have been abandoned for nearly thirty years. The cold are not necessarily clothed, the hungry not necessarily fed—this defies all conventional reasoning. As the *Royal Regulations* states: from the rise of hegemons downward, to warfare and fire, to blood and flesh, the common people’s suffering has reached its nadir in this age. Human nature has grown base, further corrupted by customs. They delight in chaos, rejoice in disaster, are bold in strife and bloodthirsty. The momentum of mutual predation shows no sign of abating.

Years ago, when Master Qiu was summoned to the Dragon Court, the fate of the myriad people hung upon a single word of governance and protection. Though Feng Yan’s enlightenment of the Liao ruler was no greater, the realm’s reverence for his teaching stems precisely from this. Today, the yellow-crowned Daoists comprise two-tenths of the realm, their influence vast, stirring mountains and seas. Even the violent, the fierce, the ignorant, and the unlearned have long been transformed by them. They restrain their blades and endure poison, hesitating and glancing back as if some force holds them in check. Fathers cannot command their sons, elder brothers cannot correct their younger brothers. Ritual and righteousness fail to govern their roots, punishments fail to curb their extremities.

Yet the Quanzhen school alone can salvage what remains after utter collapse. Their killing intent burns like a great fire, and they muster all their strength to extinguish it. Alas! Is this not the work of Heaven?

On the sixth day of the twelfth lunar month in the ding-you year, this record was made.

**Stele of Lingxu Abbey in Zhacheng County, Weizhou**
*Composed by Wang Han, Hanlin Academician and native of the commandery*

Zhacheng County in Weizhou lies north of the city moat, where Lingxu Abbey stands—a sanctuary founded by the Great Master of Universal Subtlety, Perfected Li. His disciples upheld his teachings with ever-deepening devotion, so that though its halls, shrines, images, corridors, kitchens, and chambers were not built with extravagance, they gradually took form through modest accumulation.

Originally, Zhacheng had been ceded to Hua Prefecture. Then, during the Jin dynasty’s Mingchang era, the Yellow River shifted its southern course and was incorporated into Weizhou. When the court fled south during the Zhenyou reign, the region became a contested frontier. A military headquarters was established, governing the prefecture, garrisoning heavy troops, and anchoring a floating bridge. Its slopes became the northern gate of the capital.

In the ren-chen year, the Jin abandoned their defenses, and the Celestial Army seized the territory. The following year, the capital suffered a great famine; people ate one another, and those fleeing death in search of sustenance numbered no fewer than a thousand daily. Upon reaching the river crossing, they were exploited for their wealth, often left unferried for days. Those who perished in the wind and snow—or drowned after crossing—numbered no fewer than a hundred each day.

Amid the chaos of an unformed age, only the Quanzhen teaching flourished. Everywhere, people turned to it as if borne by the wind. Even the violent, the domineering, and those whose nature inclined toward slaughter were stirred to seek fortune and avoid calamity. All who wore the insignia of the Dharma were of this number.

At the time, Master Wu-yu Zi, Perfected Li, was already in Weizhou. One day, witnessing these events, he sighed mournfully: *"Such calamity has befallen us—has the human impulse to kill truly reached this extremity? I came by boat to propagate the Dao on a northern journey, yet if I cannot transform this place, where else may I practice my Way?"* He then moored his vessel by the river and established this abbey as the foundation for teaching the numinous Dao.

Thereupon, the mystic wind spread, and households turned their hearts anew. Greed and cruelty were transformed into gentleness and kindness. Those who crossed the ford or dwelled in the wilds came to repent and receive instruction at his gate, their shoulders rubbing, their heels treading close. The raging flames of violence were extinguished, and the blazing fires of killing intent quelled. The ferry of compassion reached the shore, turning perilous heavens into level paths.

From this, we see that only the virtue of cherishing life, penetrating deeply into the human heart, could achieve such a transformation.

One morning, the Master gathered his disciples and said: *"I have studied the Dao for many years, and what has been imprinted upon my heart is simply unity and emptiness. Life depends on essence and spirit, and spirit finds peace in emptiness and stillness. Unity is the master of the corporeal soul, while emptiness is the root of the ten thousand things. Thus the scripture says: ‘Heaven attains unity and becomes clear; Earth attains unity and becomes stable; spirits attain unity and become numinous.’ ‘Attain utmost emptiness, guard absolute stillness—then the ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return.’ Only through emptiness can one attain numinosity, and numinosity itself is empty. The heavens and earth are empty, yet manifest the marvels of growth and nurturance; the sun and moon are empty, yet radiate their illuminating light; mountains and marshes are empty, yet generate the transformations of clouds and thunder; the human heart is empty, yet becomes the spirit of the ten thousand things. To attain emptiness and reach its ultimate state, one need only refine essence, guard stillness, purify emotions, and eliminate desires."* He then inscribed the abbey’s name: *Lingxu* (Numinous Emptiness).

*"My disciples,"* he continued, *"a noble person of great virtue appears dull-witted. Now, eight or nine out of ten among the common folk follow this teaching. I cannot remain here long."* The next day, he departed.

From then on, the influence of his teachings and practices spread throughout the Hebei region.

The Master’s personal name was Zhi-yuan, a native of Yueshan in Qinyuan. At just over thirty, he abandoned his wife and children to enter the Dao, studying under Master Bixu of Fushan. He received the true transmission in full, delving deeply into the mysteries of nature. For many years, he was revered as the great patriarch, presiding over the mystic teachings at the ancestral court of Zhongnan.

His life was devoted to aiding others, as recorded in the stele of Chongyang Abbey; here, I shall not repeat it.

In the bing-wu year, he was summoned to perform the great jiao ritual in Yanjing. After the emperor received the blessings, he bestowed upon the Master the title *Perfected of Universal Subtlety* and honored him with a jeweled crown and cloud-patterned robes. The world came to know him as Master Wine-Li.

In the spring of the jia-yin year, he was again summoned to the court for the jiao ritual. That summer, in the sixth lunar month, the Perfected ascended at Changchun Abbey in Yanjing. When his disciples opened his coffin upon his return west, his complexion was as if alive.

Eleven months later, in the winter, his remains were escorted to Weizhou. His disciple Wang Zhi-an and others, clad in mourning hemp, performed the rites. For a full day, lamentations filled the air as if mourning their own parents. The jiao ritual and offerings continued for three days and nights before they departed—a fitting observance.

As the procession set forth, auspicious clouds appeared from the northeast, casting a shadowy canopy that stretched to the southwest before dispersing over the riverbank. That night, a north wind shook the houses, but as the boat prepared to cross, it stilled, and the vessel rested as steadily as land.

Alas, how extraordinary!

In the spring of the fifth year of Zhongtong, Zhi’an and others, desiring to immortalize their master’s virtue and ensure his legacy endured, presented ritual gifts and entreated: "Our late master’s deeds and teachings are too profound for words. Where his instruction reached, his presence remained. Yet the marvel of his transforming influence and abiding spirit, the origins of his teachings and the foundations he laid—without written record to guide those who come after, to whom shall the responsibility fall? You, sir, have long been devoted to compiling scriptures and honoring great deeds. We humbly beg you to recount his Way for us." I bowed twice in assent.

Though I belong to the Confucian school, and our paths differ so that we do not deliberate together, I admire their reverence for their master and their devotion to the roots of their teaching. Thus, I have arranged their account in order.

The Quanzhen tradition began with the cultivation of truth and withdrawal from the world—retreating to lofty heights, vanishing into mountain forests like a stag in the wild, utterly detached from worldly affairs. Yet in the end, its followers mingled among people, shedding the filth of the world like a cicada’s molt, taking universal salvation and benefiting all beings as their daily practice. Could it be that they govern the self with the true Dao, govern the state with its remnants, and govern the world with earthly simplicity? If not, then the nature endowed by Heaven, the principles inherent in all things, and the unchanging order of human relations—how could these ever be corrupted?

Take the Perfected Lord Qiu of Changchun, for instance. When the emperor of the former dynasty sought his counsel, he first emphasized governing the state and protecting the people. His benefits were indeed vast. Now, observing the conduct of the Perfected Lord Li, Preceptor of the Mysterious and Subtle, it seems that had their places been exchanged, each would have acted the same. Thus, I record this.

I also composed a poem for his disciples, evoking his distant wanderings as an immortal, to stir thoughts of soaring beyond the dust of the world:

The great origin of the Dao flows from Heaven,
The Historian of the Pillars first delved into its mysteries.
Later men relied on earthly simplicity to transmit it,
Spreading countless words through idle talk.

They prayed, performed exorcisms, ingested alchemical elixirs from golden crucibles,
Dwelt in purple towers to attain immortality.
Quanzhen alone prized the tortoise and jade as its measure,
Taking the square inch of the heart as its field of blessings.

The Seven Masters dredged the river’s source,
Their dragon-like virtue and phoenix-like qualities illuminating past and present.
The waves of their fame surged to the eastern sea’s edge,
As the Perfected One leapt forth from Yuan and Yue’s mountains.

Endowed by Heaven with a nature of emptiness, stillness, and focus,
Not a single thing attained—this was my failing.
The Yellow River churned with crocodiles and whirlpools,
Their insatiable greed ever drooling with hunger.

The people of Bian, spared from death, clung to their boats,
To be devoured by such creatures would truly be unjust.
The Master, his Dao shining like the sun’s rays,
Brushed aside his wine-stained sleeves, his sandals worn through.

With a grin, he plucked his beard to weave a net,
Kicked the muddy waves into a clear abyss.
The refugees crossing north relied on him to survive,
His work accomplished, he claimed no credit—how the world revered him!

Transcending the realm of things like a soaring wild goose,
A thousand-year-old tree on a misty peak,
He inscribed the sacred palace with his profound words,
Each phrase embodying the Dao, his vision of the Way complete.

Like the axe-handle carved by gazing at the handle,
He opened the eyes of the ignorant.
His disciples followed his teachings, circling without end,
As if entering Zhuangzi’s garden or the mulberry grove—
To this day, his radiance leaves no trace.

The moon of purity hangs in the tower of the spirit,
The yellow crane has departed, never to return.
Mount Zhongnan and Mount Taihua stand empty and towering,
The primordial essence of Golden Flower remains verdant through the ages.

Alas, who in this blind world can be cured?
The jade-like herbs of the mountains grow in vain.
When will the Perfected One return in his feathered chariot,
Ascending the Kunlun peaks into the crimson clouds?

My poem, carved in stone, must not be forgotten—
Let it serve as a beacon for his return.

*Record of Chongyang Abbey in Dengzhou*
*Composed by Ma Jiuchou of Zhengting*

The winter-bearing plum astonished Confucius, who recorded it as a marvel; the autumn-blooming pear led Jing Quan to reproach himself. Now this abbey is named for the Double Ninth—does it belong to the same category as the plum and pear? No. For things that bloom again after their season has passed are contrary to Heaven, while men who return to simplicity after dissipation are in accord with Heaven. Those in accord with Heaven follow the Heavenly Dao; those contrary to Heaven follow the human way. Heaven is judged by qi, man by spirit; spirit derives from Heaven, and spirit is akin to qi. Heaven is fundamentally yang, yet when it chills things, it becomes yin; man is fundamentally yang, yet when he engages with things, he becomes yin. Though Heaven may briefly turn yin, it swiftly reverts to yang, and thus Heaven remains ever Heaven. But when man pursues yin, his yang never returns, and thus man cannot preserve his spirit forever.

Consider how swiftly frost strips the trees—how few dawns and dusks pass before the yang qi stirs in the Yellow Springs! Yet how vastly different is this from the man whose great simplicity has scattered, who wanders heedlessly as before. If a man can return to simplicity, vast as thunder congealing or a mound rising from darkness, then this abbey named for the Double Ninth may well serve as a warning to the disciples of the Master beneath the Pillars.

The Master beneath the Pillars took simplicity as yang, hence his words: *"Return again to simplicity."* Later generations of alchemists did not align with him, abandoning the Dao to cultivate techniques, and so the teaching that simplicity is yang faded away. In man’s life, when simplicity is nine-tenths and dissipation one-tenth, he is a child; when dissipation is nine-tenths and simplicity one-tenth, he is in peril. The learning of the Master beneath the Pillars—is it not like an infant who has yet to become a child?

Simplicity is not stupidity; simplicity is like plain silk, unmarred by the five colors. Simplicity is like blandness, unsullied by the five flavors. This is the yang of tranquil yang. To abandon this and seek yang is like beating a drum to find a lost child. To seek yang through simplicity—was Wang Chongyang of Mount Zhongnan not such a man?

I do not know what manner of man he was, but his disciples say: Wang Chongyang, whose personal name was Gu and courtesy name Zhiming, took Chongyang as his sobriquet. Skilled in both civil and martial arts, he lived during the decline of the Qi and Fuchang regimes, renouncing fame and rank to indulge in wine daily. At forty-eight, he encountered two extraordinary men and attained enlightenment in the profound principles. Thereafter, he wandered among cliffs and shores, traveling to the edge of the sea, gathering many followers. Later, he shed his mortal form in Bianliang.

Now, Wang Li, a military officer in the Zhenfang Camp of Dengzhou and a native of Penglai in Deng Prefecture, in his youth received instruction from Wang’s disciples. For decades, he has wielded shield and spear to defend the frontier. Now in his old age, he recalls the profound words of his youth and delights in tranquility and retreat. South of his home stands an ancient shrine to the Master beneath the Pillars. He cleared the brambles, built walls, and established this abbey, appointing Wang Daoxian, Han Lianzhen, and Liu Zhigang—disciples of Chongyang—as its abbots. By the grace of the imperial court, he obtained its plaque, naming it after his master’s sobriquet.

The cost of beams, statues, vessels, vegetable plots, farming tools, and labor amounted to twenty thousand strings of cash, all provided by Wang Li. One day, he entrusted his fellow disciples Yu Zhihui and Wu Tongwen to deliver a letter from my old friend Wang Wanshan, requesting an inscription from me. Unable to refuse, I took the Master beneath the Pillars’ teaching that simplicity is yang as a warning and composed this inscription:

Simplicity is the mother of qi, the foundation of the formless;
Within the formless, yang finds its obscurity.
Ever since the Six Bores pierced the apertures,
The dark yin has gnawed at the crystal of yang.

When has the army of the mind been recalled for even a moment?
Drifting like plantain leaves, stumbling like deer—awake or still dreaming?
The dark pearl sinks unseen into the azure depths;
Who can return to being the infant held in the arms?

With strength, he drags the Azure Dragon back to the Great Clarity.
There was an extraordinary man who cast aside brilliance,
Riding the primordial qi to the divine capital,
Gazing down from the crimson clouds upon the constellations.

Was there ever a humble chamber that intruded upon the palace?
The Double Yang—how the great simplicity overflows!
Later generations built this abbey in his name.
Alas, my words are but the sighing of the wind—
The wordless word is the true inscription.

*Stele Inscription for the Founding of Jade Clarity Abbey in Yanjing*
*Composed by Zhao Fu of Yunmeng*

A single scholar, if he harbors a heart that cherishes all things, will inevitably benefit others. The noble men of antiquity, bearing virtue and Dao, though they might not have had the chance to serve their times, still acted within their villages and towns to fulfill their duties. When even that was impossible, they took saving lives as their personal mission.

In the past, Lu Xuangong, with his learning in benevolence and righteousness, assisted Emperor Dezong. In his later years, exiled to Zhongzhou, he lived in a hut with earthen windows, sitting upright all day, transcribing the *Bencao*, and preparing medicines to aid the sick of the prefecture. Thus, Minister Fan Wenzheng once said: *"In success, I wish to be the emperor’s teacher; in failure, I wish to be a good physician."* The benevolent take the governance of the people and all things as their concern; they never, even in obscurity, forget this duty.

In Yanjing, there was a reclusive gentleman surnamed Ma, named Tianlin, with the courtesy name Junrui. His religious name aspired to follow the ancient worthies. His family, originally from Dexing in Shanggu, had for generations risen through medicine, though their hidden virtues remained unheralded. During the Dading and Mingchang eras of the Jin dynasty, when the northern frontier was being managed and the Great Yuan Marshal’s Prefecture was established in Huanzhou, his father accompanied the expedition as a physician.

At the time, the gentleman was nearly twenty. Fluent in the Jurchen language, he was appointed as an interpreter for the marshal’s prefecture. Through successive postings under various marshals, he was always praised for his resourcefulness.

After more than a decade of service, his term expired, and he returned home. In the Jiaxu year of the Zhenyou era, he crossed the Yellow River with a staff, joining the staff of the military headquarters to review past merits. The authorities, examining his record, appointed him as the supervisor of wine taxes in Weizhen County, Bozhou. Upon completing his term, he resigned and declined further office, settling between Xuchang and Bianjing.

He had long been acquainted with the Venerable Master Chongxu, Li Gong, and frequently traveled to the Danyang Abbey in the capital, often associating with renowned scholars and officials. In the Renchen year of the Zhengda era, when the state fell, he boldly crossed north to Yanjing and formally became a disciple of Master Dongzhen Yu, the Perfected One, as his teacher.

Finding himself at odds with the world, he journeyed north through Yuyu Pass, traversed Wuchuan, and begged for alms in the borders of Changzhou. Seeing encampments scattered and many afflicted by illness, most lacking medical care, he was moved by memories of the past. He then revealed his closely guarded art of "threefold-elbow healing," preparing medicinal powders that restored the sick to health. At that time, Minister Na Yan was avoiding the summer heat beyond the ridges when he fell gravely ill with chronic wine-induced ailments in his outer tent. Upon summoning the gentleman to examine him, a single dose cured him instantly. Overjoyed, Na grasped his hand, their bond as if lifelong friends. They rode south together, paying respects to Master Qinghe, who bestowed upon him the religious name Qingyi Zi.

Upon returning to Yanjing, east of the Prime Minister’s residence and north of the thoroughfare, a short distance away lay Ganquan Ward. There stood the Eastern Peak Temple, where the locals reverently worshipped. When the gentleman arrived, they offered him the vacant seat to reside in, and he contributed to its upkeep. Later, he acquired several acres of land, clearing brambles and reeds to build a thatched hut. Selling timber and firing bricks, he constructed the Yuqing Abbey, providing shelter for Daoist clergy and gathering followers from all directions.

Yanjing lay over a thousand *li* from Changzhou. Each summer, he would journey there, returning by autumn—a yearly routine. Those he visited were all princes and nobles. All medical supplies left from the military were donated to the abbey, not a single item kept for personal use. Na Yan and his younger brother, the Third Minister, admired his integrity, frugality, and few desires, always treating him with respect and often aiding his needs. Additionally, Abbot Li Zhixuan of the Southern Hermitage collaborated with him extensively in managing the abbey. The main hall, four bays wide, was completed, and plans were made to enshrine an image of the Primordial Beginning. The refectory and living quarters were fit for dining and residence, while the kitchen, well, and vegetable garden allowed for washing and irrigation. The layout was bright, spacious, and orderly, a place for burning incense and quiet repose.

Inheriting the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he modeled himself after Zhuangzi and Liezi, fulfilling his aspirations and duties. He shared a deep bond with Li Zhitong, the Taiyi Daoist official, and Liu Zhi’an, the Danyang Master, forming a fellowship of kindred spirits in their pursuit of truth beyond the mundane.

One day, he fell ill without cause. He said to the two masters: "I have passed the age of following my heart’s desires, and the great limit approaches. For thirty years, I have journeyed with you both, our footsteps covering half the realm. My humble efforts in building this nest were merely to create a place for my teacher, the Perfected One, and his disciples to transmit the Dao. Yet among my disciples and followers, none have been entrusted with succession. The future of Yuqing Abbey must be inscribed in enduring stone to ensure its legacy. I entrust you to see this through."

After consulting ancient precedents, they agreed it was fitting. By nature, he was generous, open-hearted, and without guile—reverent, broad in love, indifferent to wealth, and fond of giving. Since donning official robes, he had held himself to strict discipline, adhering to his teacher’s instructions and humbly serving others. Changzhou lay along the thoroughfare for the Four Horse Relay; each year, when the Perfected Zhenchang oversaw the northern observance of the Celestial Court, he ensured every detail was meticulously prepared, leaving nothing amiss. Thus, his dedication to the Dao was truly profound. Therefore, I record the course of his life and append this inscription:

---

The Great Void is formless,
The Jade Clarity, colorless.
The Dao is but a forced name—
How could transformation have limits?

August and reverent, the August Emperor,
Precedes even the Lord of Manifestations.
Radiant beams soar, splendid and grand,
Pillars and eaves stand in solemn array.

Dark jade rises like mountains,
Timber flows in ordered ranks.
A model for the state,
A sight for the people to behold.

Flourishing, the Prime Minister’s residence,
Guarded and cherished.
With gentle guidance,
His contributions were vast.

Abiding in the One brings fulfillment,
Extending even to the humblest soil.
Cultivate it to attain truth,
And bring blessings to all under heaven.

As fortunes rise and fall,
He embraced the scrolls without fixed course.
Reviving the dying, healing the sick—
A master of the threefold-elbow art.

I open this abstruse sanctuary
To gather all beginnings.
A master of vast learning,
Companion to the divine and enlightened.

East of the Western Mountains,
West of the Eastern Mountains,
I inscribe this verse,
For the streams of the world.

*Stele of Qiuyang Abbey, Dexing Prefecture*
*Composed by Zhang Ben of Chanyuan*

In the Gengchen year of the Great Dynasty, Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring, the Perfected One, emerged from beyond the seas, his pure wind and mysterious conduct renowned even in the imperial capital. The Son of Heaven bestowed upon his trusted ministers the Golden Tiger Tallies and dispatched them with handwritten edicts to summon him, further commanding that envoys be permitted to act at their discretion throughout his journey. The Prefect welcomed him beyond the city walls, the Magistrate led the way before him, and he traversed tens of thousands of li, escorted by five hundred armored cavalry. Upon being granted an audience, he remained in attendance for many days before being graciously permitted to depart, the provisions for his escort and conveyance unchanged from the original decree.

As he neared Mount Yan, he halted his carriage in Dexing, seeking respite from the toils of his long journey. In the wilds of Huailai, years of incessant warfare had left bones exposed upon the earth. The Daoist priest Han Zhijiu of Great Quill Mountain had long gathered and interred them, and now, as he prepared the Yellow Register rites, he bowed twice and earnestly entreated the Master to oversee the ceremony. Signs of divine response soon followed: a green phoenix sought its reflection, and mirages appeared upon the mountain.

When the rites were complete, the Master leaned upon his staff and ascended the southern slope of Great Quill Mountain. Surveying the landscape’s splendor, he gazed southward toward Mount Jin, overlooking fertile fields stretching smooth and level to the horizon. Above, the peaks of Juyong rose in jagged array, their mists and verdure dense as clouds, their banners seeming to plow the sky, as if the Penglai Isles themselves had convened. Turning eastward, he beheld the range of Great Quill Mountain, its forests veiled in mist, its greenery interwoven like a hundred bolts of brocade unfurled in the dwelling of Ge Zhichuan. To either side, two peaks rose in emerald sharpness, like paired jade standards standing in solemn attendance, poised as if awaiting command. Midway down the slope, a spring wound its way downward like a jade dragon gathering rain, its sinuous flow leisurely and unhurried.

The Master paused, leaned upon his staff, and sighed: *"Such seclusion in these cliffs and ravines, such beauty in these woods and streams—yet the clamor of the marketplace cannot disturb it, nor the bustle of traffic reach it. Is this not the profound seclusion of a grotto-heaven?"* At that moment, the summer heat had just receded, and autumn’s dew had only begun to fall. A thousand blossoms bore fruit, ten thousand leaves shimmered in the light, and the sun’s brilliance shone anew through the gaps of the harvest season. *"Is this not the radiance of autumn’s sun?"* he mused. *"I shall build a sanctuary upon this mountain and name this abode ‘Autumn Sun.’ Come, Zhijiu, see that you fulfill this for me."*

The priest assented and withdrew, saying: *"The ‘Autumn Sun’ appears in the writings of Master Zeng, and Master Su also composed a rhapsody upon it. Now our teacher names this abbey thus—surely his intent is that we, his disciples, cultivate inner conduct as solemn and pure as autumn’s clarity, and present an outward demeanor as harmonious and warm as the sun’s gentleness. When these two principles intermingle, the fullest potential of the Daoist tradition shall be realized."*

Having received his charge, the priest embraced emptiness in his dealings with others and strict discipline in his own conduct. He cleared brambles, felled trees, molded bricks, and hired laborers, personally enduring hardships and perils. Not for a single moment did he dare to rest or recline upon his mat. After ten winters had passed, he had erected the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, the Hall of the Seven Perfected, the eastern and western chambers, the inner and outer gates—all resplendent in their soaring elegance. Guest quarters, cloud hermitages, spring-fed kitchens, and vegetable gardens were arranged with perfect suitability. At dawn, black cranes arrived; at dusk, white clouds gathered. The halls were serene and spacious, the flowers and trees lush and shady—a veritable day within the lesser grotto-heavens.

The community grew to over seven hundred disciples. Each year, they cultivated white grain, and a cartload of offerings was regularly presented as tribute. The abbey’s design and construction were meticulously complete, and from this, the priest’s aspirations could be discerned.

He then dispatched a messenger to Yan Jing, bearing gifts and entreating me to compose an inscription: *"Our late teacher’s vision was such that I, his unworthy disciple, could scarcely fathom it, let alone uphold it. For years, I have tread here as if upon spring ice, as if bearing a platter of water, trembling lest I neglect or fail his command. Now that I have preserved it to the end, may his spirit in heaven not find me wanting. You, sir, once served in the Hanlin Academy and are surely a master of eloquence whose words will endure through the ages. I humbly beseech you to bestow upon us a text that will shelter our descendants and ensure this place’s immortality."*

I, too, admired this priest, a scion of the Yan Mountain Han clan, who swiftly cast aside worldly bonds to endure a hundred hardships and fulfill his teacher’s vision. Such devotion is indeed worthy of praise. Thus, I compose these words:

*"Penglai is not far—
It may dwell amidst the dust.
To reveal its hidden depths,
One must await the arrival of a Perfected One."*

Amidst the ruins of Great Wings, ten thousand mountains scale upon scale, morning cradles limpid springs, night rests upon white clouds. Yet how distant the age, how silent and unheard—could it be that even such an era of flourishing has its appointed time? Who knows that autumn’s sun must await eternal spring? Once inscribed in the annals of worthies, its spirit redoubles. Mist and haze shift hue, flowers and trees exhale fragrance, halls rise in grandeur, their dimensions precisely measured.

Here, one may advocate the mysteries of the Dao; in stillness, one may cultivate benevolence. Every foot of timber bears the mark of careful thought, every block of stone the touch of a hand. Not for these feather-clad ones to delight in a hundred labors—for what the master once aspired to, I too shall see fulfilled.

Yet with time comes decay; without renewal, nothing remains new. Let this be proclaimed to those who come after: regard this carved text.

*Record of the Founding of Zhenchang Abbey*
Composed by Wang Pan, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Glorious Consultation, Participant in the Drafting of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History

Zhenchang Abbey is a detached sanctuary of Changchun Palace, founded by Lord Li of Zhenchang and thus named after him. Initially, the western precinct of the palace stood directly opposite Chaoyuan Pavilion, roughly a li distant, where a tract of abandoned land lay overgrown with brambles and choked with broken tiles. In the aftermath of war and fire, households were few, and residents shunned its desolation and remoteness, none willing to dwell there.

One day, Zhenchang, staff in hand, happened upon the site. Parting the thorns and treading the rubble, he ascended the northern mound, surveyed the surroundings, and lingered long before saying to his attendants: “This place is fit for habitation. When I one day retire from office, I shall rest my old age here.” In his leisure, he gradually cleared the brambles, carted away the debris, and found the soil rich and fertile. He dug a well, and the water ran sweet and cold. Soon, he repaired the vegetable gardens, planted various trees, and though no carpenter’s tools had yet been applied, the vision of a Daoist sanctuary—its halls and towers, its secluded and lofty retreat—already shimmered before his eyes.

After Zhenchang passed from this world, the Perfected Zhang Chengming succeeded him in overseeing the teachings of the Dao. Carrying forward Zhenchang’s legacy, he constructed the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, the Hall of the Nine Perfected, the refectory, the altar for prayers to the Perfected, and the shrine of the Divine Marshal. He also built over ten quiet chambers within the enclosing walls to house those elders of the abbey whose years and virtue were esteemed, who no longer bore the burden of duties but delighted in cultivating stillness.

Several years after Chengming’s passing, the superintendent Ran Zhicheng, the attendant Wen Li Zhi Heng, and others gathered one day in the hall. Gazing upon the soaring eaves, surveying the tranquil gardens, they remarked to one another: “To clear brambles and remove rubble, to transform what others had abandoned into a place of beauty—such was the foresight of Lord Li of Zhenchang. To marshal labor and resources, to fulfill the legacy of our late master and bring this grand vision to fruition—such was the benevolence of Perfected Zhang Chengming. We, who enjoy the lingering shade of our masters’ virtue, have done nothing ourselves yet sit to reap the rewards. We must not allow the good deeds of these two worthy masters to fade into obscurity.” They resolved to quarry stone and inscribe a record for posterity. Thus, they came seeking these words.

I replied: To discuss events by examining their traces is not as profound as seeking the principle behind the traces; when principle is grasped, the events themselves are no longer obscure. The establishment of a detached sanctuary for a Daoist abbey is not for the sake of adding more halls, nor for enhancing splendor and magnificence, nor for amassing wealth, nor for facilitating excursions. The worthy cherish lofty aspirations beyond the world and a resolve to transcend vulgar customs. When the Dao is revered, all things gather; when virtue flourishes, people return. Yet their desire to soar high and retreat far cannot always be fulfilled. Thus, they settle for this convenient and secluded site, a temporary refuge for their yearning to dwell in mountain forests.

As Zhuangzi said, “The sage nests like a quail and eats like a cart’s hub.” To nest like a quail is to have no fixed abode; to eat like a hub is to rely on what comes without self-provision. Yet those who oversee the teachings of the Dao today are no longer like the ancients. Residing in the capital, they maintain the imperial incense and conduct rituals, with hundreds or thousands of disciples in their abbeys. Their halls and towers, adorned with ornate eaves, stretch along the thoroughfares. The capital’s hundreds of thousands of households seek daily rituals of purification and exorcism, their requests endless. Eminent officials, great families, and wealthy households exchange gifts and courtesies in a ceaseless flow. Moreover, Daoist priests from across the realm come to pay their respects at the abbey gates year after year, their footsteps never ceasing. A slight lapse in etiquette breeds resentment; a single failure to meet expectations sparks grievances. Though the Daoist abbey is nominally a place of tranquility and lofty purity, in truth, it differs little from a bustling and demanding government office.

Thus, the purpose of Changchun’s detached sanctuary is to provide a retreat from clamor and a respite from busyness. When the heart seeks clarity, one may rest here, withdrawing from the hall to enjoy lasting leisure. Such a sanctuary is not only fitting and precious but indispensable.

Laozi said, “The noble one travels all day without leaving his baggage train; though he may dwell in splendor, his repose remains transcendent.” Thus, the detached sanctuary is where the noble one parks his baggage and preserves his place of repose. To calculate the fertility of the land or tally the number of halls, like a great family accumulating wealth to enrich itself and pursue prosperity, is not the intention of the worthy. Therefore, I set this forth.

Recorded on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month in the autumn of the yihai year of the Zhiyuan era.

A Record of the Restoration of Lingxu Abbey in Shanzhou of Great Jin
Composed by Xin Yuan, the Recluse of Nüji Mountain

In the third year of the Xingding reign, the jimao year, in the fourth month of early summer, a Daoist of Lingxu Abbey in Shanzhou, surnamed Xin and styled Xisheng, presented to me a map of the abbey’s grounds along with an account of its founding and subsequent undertakings. He then requested a commemorative text, saying:

Xisheng’s ancestral home lies in Hezhong, where he was born in Pingyang. From childhood, he left his native place to wander afar, becoming a Daoist under Master Tiyuan of Yun’guang Cave on Mount Tieding of the Nine Tripods—Yuanyang the Perfected, the Great Master of the Mysterious. He has delved deeply into the essentials of the Supreme Dao.

The Great Master’s personal name was Chuyi, his surname Wang, and he hailed from Muping. Initiated into the Dao by the Patriarch Chongyang the Perfected, he became one of the eminent disciples of the Quanzhen tradition, standing shoulder to shoulder in renown with the great immortals Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Sun, and Hao. From the reigns of Emperor Shizong through those of Zhangzong and Weisheng, he was repeatedly honored with imperial favor, receiving titles, robes, and distinctions that brought radiance to our lineage.

At seventy-six years of age, he wearied of the world and shed his mortal form in Bumou—this was three years ago. Throughout his life, he composed many verses and hymns in praise of the Dao, which have spread far and wide, recited by all who cherish the Way. Yet his sole work, the five-character long-rhymed *Poetic Formulae of the Golden Elixir*, remained privately held by Xisheng for many years, unknown to others. Now, as Xisheng grows old and has settled in Shaan, he has joined with two or three like-minded companions to establish this dwelling, a place of rest, sustenance, and lodging for fellow Daoists from all directions. Reflecting that the profound writings of our late master should not remain forever concealed, he has reverently carved them into stone, to be shared with all cultivators of the Dao in later ages. Yet without a master of literary expression to record its origins, even this would remain obscure and untransmitted. Having heard that you, sir, excel in ancient-style prose and often consort with those beyond the worldly realm, I venture to make this earnest request. Moved by his sincerity, I could not refuse, and thus, though I am no match for the task, I have undertaken it.

Tracing the origins of the Daoist tradition, we find it rooted in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Later, Liezi and Zhuang Zhou expanded and deepened it, establishing it alongside Confucius’ teachings as a guiding doctrine for the world, enduring without decline. For it unites life and death, dissolves the distinction between self and other, and harmonizes all existence in the realm of ultimate emptiness, distilling its essence into the most sublime truths. Even its seemingly lesser aspects still descend to inform the inner sageliness and outer kingship of heaven, earth, and the divine. Scholars such as Sima Qian, Liu Xiang, and Ge Hong, renowned for their vast learning, all extolled its virtues without daring to dismiss it as trivial. Yet the benighted of later ages often cling to its dregs, claiming Laozi’s writings abolish benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, rendering them unfit for instruction. This misapprehension led the refined gentlemen of the Jin and Liang dynasties to indulge in empty discourse, bringing chaos to the realm, and thus the tradition was condemned as heretical and denounced as unorthodox—a grave error.

Upon reflection, though the Quanzhen school emerged only recently, it has fully encompassed the profound teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. In their conduct and engagement with the world, its adherents display much that is admirable: their humility resembles that of the Confucians, their diligence that of Mozi, and their compassion that of the Buddhists. As for their steadfast simplicity, their detachment from worldly striving, they evoke those who cultivate primordial chaos. They stand in stark contrast to those who flaunt eccentricity as loftiness, flatter to gain advantage, or feign enlightenment to deceive, startling the deaf and dazzling the blind, all while shamelessly pursuing fame and profit. If some deviate from the Way, it is due to their own moral failings, not to any flaw in the Dao itself. Thus, Xisheng’s endeavor to establish this place for seekers stems from such convictions. It is for this reason that I find merit in his work and gladly celebrate it, hoping that those who hear of it in the future, following its path to traverse the gates of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, may come to understand that the great completeness of the sage’s Dao has always had its place—not to be confined to a single corner.

The foundation of this site spans five *mu*. The land was acquired in the *renshen* year of the Cheng’an era. The sacred hall, kitchen, and cloud chambers—all three structures—are now complete, their design neither extravagant nor crude. At the time, war and famine followed one upon the other, which accounts for the modest scale of the undertaking. The one who exerted himself most in this endeavor was Wu Daojian, a fellow townsman of Xisheng’s and his senior in years, who has since passed away. The one who contributed funds and wholeheartedly supported the project was Li Zheng, a native of Chengping from a family of officials, a man of pure conduct and devotion to the Dao, now serving as magistrate of Qi. The gentlemen Yu Daoxian and Tan Shouzhong, both fellow disciples of Xisheng, were also involved.

**Stele Inscription for the Construction of Kaiyang Abbey**
*Composed by Hanlin Academician Zhang Ben*

In the spring of the dīngyǒu year, on the day following the full moon of the second month, the Daoist priests of Kaiyang Abbey in Jing Prefecture arrived at my gate at dawn, clad in dark robes and bearing a white petition. Through the introduction of Master Zhang Zhisu, Superintendent of Changchun Abbey in Yanjing, they bowed twice, touched their foreheads to the ground, and spoke thus:

Kaiyang Abbey in Jing was first established by our late master, Master Tongxuan of great virtue. The Very Perfect Lord of Eternal Spring, recognizing his profound power, bestowed upon it its name. From whence its fame spread, and by what roots it was nourished—these matters, though once as bright as sun and moon, have now faded with time. As the one now charged with this duty, I bear deep concern day and night, lest I bring shame upon those who came before. I dare recount these events and present them to those who may unite in this cause. You, sir, have long served in the Hanlin Academy and are surely one of this age’s most renowned masters of literary composition. What you write will endure for posterity. I humbly entreat you to bestow upon us a precious text, to be engraved upon this sacred stele as an eternal record.

I, too, as a disciple of his lineage, must honor my master’s aspirations and cannot decline. Thus, I append these words:

Master Tongxuan’s surname was Yang, his personal name Zhidao. He was a native of Lingquan in Macheng County, Luanzhou. His master bore the title *Tongxuan*, a name conferred by the former Jin court. In the gēngxū year of the Mingchang era, he donned the Daoist robe, guided by the venerable Master Langran. After three years of accompanying him in staff and sandals, he nurtured aspirations to journey across the four directions.

Upon arriving at Wuqing, he dwelt within a walled garden, withdrawing from worldly affairs for three full years. Emerging, he passed through Huizhou, traversed Lingyan, where some subjected him to cruel and unjust treatment—yet he offered no defense. Recognizing the mountain’s potential as a sanctuary for cultivating truth, he removed his cap, cast off his sandals, and carved a cave into the stone with his own hands. For a decade, he labored with unwavering devotion. When the cave was complete, a spring welled forth—what is now known as the Dripping Water Grotto.

The officials, elders, and esteemed figures of Huizhou’s Shenshan County, admiring his resolve and lofty conduct, invited him to their domain. There, he established the Taiqing Abbey in the dīngmǎo year of the Taihe era. When the Zhēnyòu reign began, he once more wandered as a cloud upon the waters, sojourning in Xingping.

The original patrons of this abbey—the state counselor Guojianu of the Yanjing Branch Secretariat, Prefect Wang Zhongwen of Jingzhou, attendant Chen Mei, Prefect Li Ji of Runzhou, and their fellow officials—having long heard of his Daoist renown, yearned to receive his teachings in person. In the dīngchǒu year, they presented a petition to the prefecture, offering a parcel of land at Sujiazhuang: twenty *li* north to south, three *li* east to west, bounded by Dragon Ridge to the left, the Hun River to the right, Iron Mountain to the front, and Peng Peak to the rear. He was granted free rein to till, quarry, and build as he saw fit.

He began by clearing brambles and felling trees, molding bricks and quarrying stone. Within, he established a sanctuary where the Dao’s winds stirred; without, he endured hardship to inspire his disciples. In less than a decade, he erected the Three Pure Ones’ main hall, a cloud pavilion to the west, a refectory to the east, and guest quarters like soaring wings—all arranged with serene precision. Vegetable gardens spread wide, orchards stood in orderly rows, purple gates framed the clouds, and lush shade blotted out the sun. It became a realm unto itself, a paradise within the grotto.

He reclaimed over ten *qǐng* of land, and though his followers numbered in the hundreds, their daily gruel and porridge were never lacking, nor did any feel slighted. As the abbey neared completion, the Perfected Master Changchun, by imperial decree, returned to bestow a name upon it. Thus, it was called Kaiyang—"Opening Yang."

Now, the virtue of *yang* is fundamentally benevolent, luminous, and unyielding, yet its waning and waxing are ever subject to the vicissitudes of time. In the hexagram *Bó*’s sixth line, five *yin* forces advance while the solitary *yang* remains unborn—is this not the plight of decline? In *Qián*’s ninth line, its virtue is too rigid, on the verge of snapping, its portent a blazing fire—is this not the peril of excess?

Who, then, can preserve the fullness of *yang*’s luminous virtue and fulfill the work of nurturing life? None but Kaiyang. For this name signifies spring, generation, harmony, and equilibrium. It has already departed the void of disuse yet avoids the extremity of overreach. That this abbey was so named reflects Master Tongxuan’s virtue: neither so yielding as to fade away nor so unyielding as to break, but balanced—just as the Perfected Master Changchun intended in bestowing it.

Master Tongxuan’s father was named Chong. He often spoke of their lineage, which had produced but a single heir for four generations, each relying on hidden virtue to sustain itself. By Tongxuan’s time, there were six brothers. The eldest, Boyi, maintained the ancestral sacrifices. The youngest died young. Of the remaining four—Bohe, Daoyi, Zhijian, and Tongxuan—all donned the feathered robe.

Tongxuan was by nature resolute and clear-sighted, with a strong sense of purpose, yet he tempered himself with restraint. His brow always bore a tranquil expression. He was forthright, disdaining pretense, and though he endured hardships, he always led the way. He welcomed wandering Daoists, offering them shelter and sustenance, even emptying his coffers to do so. Thus, he amassed no private wealth. Over three hundred disciples from near and far studied under him.

On the third day of the twelfth month in the rényín year, he fell mildly ill and, expounding on the Dao, passed away. His disciples built a shrine on the abbey’s eastern side and interred him there. To this day, they gather at the appointed times to offer sacrifices without fail.

**Inscription:**
The gate opens to *Qián*, as *yang* unfolds—
Why does this pure name descend?
Tongxuan’s abbey mirrors his virtue;
Changchun’s decree unites them like jade and pearl.

Alas, Tongxuan—now a soaring immortal—
Dwells in peace, no longer bound to our world.
*Yang* must not overreach, lest calamity strike;
Yet to wither meekly is near extinction.
Choose the middle path, where spring’s light shines—
Only those who possess such balance may resemble it.

Some may bear shame for this, but *Qián*’s face is moistened by *Ze*’s grace.
Let this stele’s words be revered, never to be forgotten.

**Stele of Tongzhen Abbey, Shunde Prefecture**
*Composed by Song Zigong, Grand Councilor*

The Daoist tradition traces its origins to the venerable Laozi. His teachings are founded upon the Great Unity (*Taiyi*) and established upon the constancy of Non-Being (*chang wu*). Within, one nurtures emptiness and tranquility; without, one employs softness, humility, and deference—thus guiding people to fathom the beginnings of heaven and earth, to comprehend the endings of all things, to empty the heart of cunning, and to act in accord with nature. Through this, one cultivates the body to attain longevity and health; orders the household to achieve fortune and prosperity; and governs the state and pacifies the world to ensure the people’s peace and the dynasty’s enduring blessings. These are no lofty, impracticable doctrines, nor fantastical or bizarre spectacles.

Yet as the ages declined, transmissions diverged. First, they transformed into the alchemical arts of the Qin and Han; then into the abstruse metaphysics of the Wei and Jin; and finally into the exorcistic rites of the Sui and Tang. Thus, the five-thousand-word *Dao De Jing* was relegated to the high shelves, deemed a useless relic.

During the Zhenglong era of the Jin dynasty, the Patriarch Wang Chongyang, through self-realized insight, propagated his teachings in the region west of the Pass. He imposed upon them the name *Quanzhen* ("Perfect Realization"), though at the time, their value was not widely recognized. At the dawn of our dynasty, his disciple Qiu Changchun was the first to receive imperial summons and was entrusted with the governance of Daoist affairs. The realm then universally revered him. From one, the teaching spread to a hundred; from a hundred, to a thousand; from a thousand, to ten thousand. Even in villages of ten clans or hamlets of a hundred households, none lacked those who transmitted the esoteric learning. How much more so in great cities and vast metropolises? This is the reason for the establishment of Tongzhen Abbey.

Upon examination, the abbey lies in the southwestern corner of the prefectural city. In the year *xinsi* (1221), the *Zhenren* ("Perfected One") Li Zhirong of Tongxian, dwelling near the City God Temple, gathered disciples and resided there. Soon after, he purchased adjacent land, expanded it into an abbey, and thereby obtained its present name. He constructed a single hall as a place for lectures and assemblies. By the command of the *Zhangjiao* ("Master of Teachings") Yin Qinghe, he was to reside at Zongsheng Palace on Mount Zhongnan. The affairs of the abbey were then entrusted to his disciples Zhi Yong and Han Zhijiu. Both were deeply devoted to the Dao, steadfast in upholding their master’s teachings. Moreover, they gained the support of the prefectural governor, the Military Commissioner Zhao Boyuan, who served as the patron of merit. Thus, from near and far, responses flourished, and their strength grew daily.

First, they erected the great hall to the east, enshrining the Three Pure Ones. Next, they built the Ancestral Hall to the west, venerating the Seven Perfected. Thereafter, the refectory and abbot’s quarters, meditation cells and guest chambers, kitchens for preparing elixirs, and dwellings for the cloud-like assembly arose in succession. Wells, stables, storehouses, terraces, and painted halls—nothing was left unprovided. Expanding the courtyard, they created ample space; planting trees, they achieved an airy openness. Profound and serene, it became a refined abode for lofty recluses and a separate palace for the immortals.

To the south of the abbey, they established vegetable gardens to sustain the Daoist community. The complex comprises forty rooms, twenty-one statues, and sixty *mu* of land. When the great hall was completed, Zhi Yong suddenly departed this world, and the remaining tasks were completed by Zhi Jiu.

In the summer of *gengshen* (1240), I journeyed from Tanhuai to the capital at the imperial summons and once passed through this place. Thus, I record these events so that those who dwell here in future ages and enjoy its merits may know their origins.

Li Zhirong of Tongxian, a native of Luoshui, inherited his father Zhiwei’s lifelong love of simplicity and detachment. He had once studied under the *Zhenren* Li Zhishi of Kaixuan, and thus Zhirong also counted among his disciples. As his learning matured and his conduct became eminent, his elder brother Zhiduan, younger brothers Zhizang and Zhi Yong, all followed him in study and were once registered at this abbey.

Zhirong was of utmost sincerity. In his early years, he mastered the art of refining *qi* and secluded himself between Xianweng and Guangyang Mountains, withdrawing from the world for twelve years. Upon hearing that Master Changchun had received the imperial edict to journey south, he traveled to Yanshan to pay homage. There, the secret locks of the Mystic Pass yielded effortlessly. Thereafter, he transmitted the Dao across the land, wandering without fixed abode. When he later assumed the abbacy of Mount Zhongnan, his reputation grew even greater. By imperial decree, he received the title of *Zhenren* and was bestowed a golden crown and robes. Under his guidance, many attained virtue. His influence spread through the countryside, his integrity won the trust of the townsfolk. The abbeys, temples, and hermitages he established across the land number over a hundred, yet he still regarded Tongzhen as his guiding star.

Han Zhijiu, the eldest son of Dizhi, was a fellow townsman of mine. He was deeply esteemed by the great master Li Zhenchang and, by imperial commission, was granted the title *Tongzhen Dasheng* ("Great Master of Tongzhen"). When the *Zhenren* Zhang Chengming succeeded to the governance of Daoist affairs, Zhijiu was further entrusted with overseeing the communities of Shunde, Zhi, Ci, and Wei prefectures. His character may thus be well discerned.

**Inscription:**
Heaven and Earth began paired, like an egg’s seal—
Vague yet manifest, an image dwells within.
Nurturing the myriad things, yet claiming no merit,
Vast and boundless, it begins and ends as one.

Guangcheng spoke at length upon Mount Kongtong,
Yet the warm pulse of *yang* flows through the earth.
At the Pass, purple *qi* swells thickly—
Two chapters of the *Dao De Jing* open the blind and deaf.

Each school has its master, each master his lineage,
Yet later disciples diverge and clash.
From Zhongnan leapt Chongyang—
Now he sweeps away floating clouds to restore the empty sky.

The Heavenly Sovereign descended to inaugurate the Mystic Wind;
One aperture breathes forth ten thousand differences.
The Daoist of Xiangcheng obtained a youth—
On level ground, he conjured a Penglai Palace.

A thousand *li* of land embraced by Lianmeng,
No blight upon things, the harvests abundant.
Year after year, baskets and trays fill the hands of elders—
From this time forth, the transmission shall never end.

**Record of the Restoration of Taiqing Abbey**
*Composed by Wang Huan, Servant of Heaven*

A land’s excellence begets a site’s excellence—such is the inevitable principle. At this very place, with the southern bank of the Xia River at its back, Mount Liang to the north, and the Yellow River to the east, how could it lack a famed abbey or towering sanctuary?

In recent years, the Daoist Ma Zhixuan, convening assemblies in Yan and at the Ji Gate, journeyed thousands of *li* without hesitation to request a record of Taiqing’s origins and later fortunes. When asked the reason, he replied: Its founder was the late Master Qiao, the alchemist. Though his given name remains hidden, his virtue shines in the sobriquet *De Guang*. A man of Pingyang, he was by nature serene and simple, of unadorned sincerity, and deeply devoted to the joys of forests and springs. In his early years, he entered Guanzhong and received the teachings from the Master of Danyang’s lineage. Later, he begged alms in the markets of the county, where he was recognized by Liu Haobu, styled *Hao Qian*. One day, he invited his fellow adept, Li Jun *Qingxu*, to wander the northeast corner of the old city, to the garden of the Zhao family. Facing Mount Taihua, he sighed and said: *What place could surpass this for cultivating the true?* Hearing this, Zhao donated the land, and together with *Qingxu*, he built a thatched hut to dwell in—this was in the seventeenth year of the Dading era. Later, the hut became an abbey; craftsmen and laborers gathered in due course, and halls and images arose with solemn grandeur, completed at a glance. As for guest lodgings, kitchens, storehouses, stables, and gardens—all were fully provided.

During the turmoil of the Tianxing era, it was swept away to nothing. Those who restored it were Master *Xizhen* Ji Zhitong and *Lianyangzi* Zhang Zhidong. Beginning in the *bingshen* year and completing in the *xinchou* year, in just five or six years, the cinnabar walls gleamed anew, bells and chimes rang clear, and the assembly of topknotted adepts thrived. The former wasteland of tiles and thorns was wholly returned to its former glory—this was due to the magistrate, Magistrate Bai *Yu*, who presided over the effort, and the townsmen Du En and others who aided its completion. Such is its great joy.

I, too, am moved by this. Alas! Is not the human heart fundamentally good? Yet whether one acts with goodness depends entirely on the times. In an age when the pursuit of profit and advantage runs rampant, when snares are set and traps laid at every step, those of lofty aspiration and far-reaching flight have no choice but to withdraw beyond the dust of the world—this is an inevitable principle.

Thus, might the ancient practice of "avoiding place" and "avoiding speech" be the very reason for the rise of the Quanzhen teachings in our time? Some, judging by outward signs alone, may doubt the sincerity of such hearts, but this is to mistake the subtlety of their goodness. If those with worldly aspirations could truly make it their constant practice to cultivate refinement with diligence and reverence, and to adapt with flexibility and expand with generosity; if they could guide their sons and younger brothers as the Quanzhen do, honoring the Dao and revering their teachers, transforming their neighbors and villages; if the followers of Quanzhen could truly walk the path in earnest, inquiring without ceasing day and night, yielding to one another in every action, yet never losing the substance of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust—then the governance of one’s own person could be extended to the family, the affairs of one family to the state, and the policies of one state to the realm entire.

Even the harmony of the Three Dynasties and the sage-kings Yao and Shun could be attained with ease, bringing benevolence and longevity to the people, and flourishing abundance to all things—all as clear as the lines on one’s palm. Yet if one asks where the essential key lies, it begins with rectifying the heart and making the will sincere.

Recorded on the *wuxu* day of the first month of the *renzi* year.
*Record of Yuanjing Hermitage*
Composed by Gao Ming of Hedong

Mount Heng stands as one of the great strongholds of the Central Kingdom. According to the records, it was the site where the Lord of Yu conducted his northern inspections and hunts. Later generations, in unbroken succession, established a sacred shrine atop the summit of Great Luxuriance Peak to prepare for imperial sacrifices, and the place came to be known as Divine Summit. Less than two stages east of Divine Summit lies the valley called Belt Ear, reached by way of Stone Gate. Its soil is fertile and expansive, with towering ridges bounding its northern side and the Di River weaving through it, its waters rushing southeast in a murmuring flow, well-suited for irrigation and cleansing. All around, the peaks of Thousand Gold and Iron Crown rise in clear succession, as if laid out upon one’s palm. Through the four seasons, the transformations of clouds and mist, grasses and trees—now dense, now sparse, now veiled, now revealed—stir the heart with singular delight. Truly, it is one of the finest spots under heaven.

Master Chongxian of the Quanzhen tradition built an abbey there, naming it Yuanjing Hermitage. Thus, the entire splendor of the mountain was gathered to serve the halls and pavilions of Yuanjing. Initially, Master Chongxian had come from Wuchuan, intending to journey southward to propagate the teachings and guide others. Among his devoted followers were Tang-era granary officials such as Zhang Zhang, who wholeheartedly served him. As they daily heard the subtleties of the Dao, they all harbored aspirations akin to those of state-sacrificing ministers. Master Chongxian said: “A thatched hut and a bowl of rice are enough for me. Why trouble oneself with coveting worldly things? What I regret is that the sacred and true lack a hall for their symbolic representations, and my disciples have no place to tend the incense and flame.” The assembly responded in unison, saying, “We humbly receive your instruction.”

In the year *jichou*, Zhang Zhang donated thirty *mu* of his finest hereditary fields to lay the foundation. Contributions of wealth and grain arrived in an unbroken stream, and when the time came to oversee the construction, the work was completed in a mere twenty-one days—its methods simple, its progress swift, as if aided by unseen spirits. A grand hall was erected at the center, flanked by a western chamber and an eastern kitchen. Lofty walls encircled the perimeter, neither ornate nor plain, neither cramped nor extravagant, perfectly conforming to ritual standards. Though the grandest structures of cities might exhaust earth, timber, gold, and jade in their splendor, none could rival the abbey’s natural setting, where mountains, forests, springs, and stones embraced it on all sides, its aura transcending all comparison.

Master Chongxian was born with a virtuous nature; even as a child, he abstained from meat and blood. During the Dading era, Master Lingzhen of his native prefecture initiated him into the Dao and bestowed upon him the sacred instruments. Master Lingzhen was in fact a senior disciple of Master Dan Yangma, and as his transmission had a clear lineage, and he had long dwelled in seclusion, refining and transforming himself, his attainment of the Dao was swift. Later, when he paid homage to the Venerable Master Changchun, he came to understand that the essence of cultivation lay not merely in perfecting oneself but in broadly establishing Daoist sanctuaries for the greatest benefit of all. Thus, wherever he went, if the conditions were ripe, he devoted himself wholeheartedly. Counting his foundations, Yuanjing was but one among over a hundred. Even those renowned as immortal realms—secluded, lofty, and pure, such as the Lesser Grotto Heavens—dared not compare with Yuanjing. How admirable was Master Chongxian, who could be called steadfast in the Dao, self-assured, and unburdened by the mysteries of the gate of the profound!

Twenty years later, his disciples conferred among themselves, saying: “The principles of things entail rise and decline, and the ages undergo change and transformation. Only metal and stone can convey what is everlasting. Our master’s achievements stand so illustrious, yet he never claimed credit for himself—this responsibility now falls to his successors. Now that our master has departed, if we, as his heirs, do not strive to glorify and exalt his legacy, and should misfortune strike in an inescapable time, leaving his traces to fade without evidence, then our failure would be beyond words. Let us invite a scholar of literary arts to complete this record.” After repeatedly visiting my door, I was deeply moved by their earnest and sincere intent, and so I have set forth the beginning and end of this matter.

Master Chongxian was his self-styled name; his surname was Chen, his given name Zhiyi, and he hailed from Qintai in Shanzhou. He once resided at Qingxu Abbey on Mount Ge. In the spring of the *renchen* year, he passed away in accordance with the Dao, having lived eighty-one years. He was posthumously honored as the Perfected One of Penetrating Emptiness. As for his lofty conduct and extraordinary deeds, as well as the names of the disciples he guided, these are recorded on the stele at Qingxu Abbey, and thus are omitted here.

Recorded on the twenty-second day of the second month of the *guichou* year.
*Record of Shenqing Abbey*
Composed by Wang Cui of Beiping

Every Daoist abbey renowned in the world either commands the beauty of mountains and waters or boasts the grandeur of its halls and chambers. Without halls and chambers, there would be no means to manifest the teachings; without mountains and waters, there would be no way to distance oneself from the vulgar. These two are difficult to attain together, and even when both are present, without a man of Dao and virtue, they would be of no avail.

The Shenqing Abbey in Heng is the residence of Master Yunyang of the Great Dao, Liu Zhichun. As for its mountains and waters: to the east lie Wutai and Lüshui; to the west, Dunshan and Zhengyang; to the south, Jinshan, Tianya, Yangwu, and Qiangao; to the north, Yamen, Dijiao, and Dahe stretching like wilderness. As for its halls and chambers: the Hall of the Three Purities, the Hall of the Seven Perfected, the Shrine of the Mountain Spirits and Earth Deities, the Cloud Hall, the Abbot’s Quarters, the refectories, stables, and the like—all adorned with gold and azure, shaded by pines and locust trees, encircled by gardens and orchards, their splendor illuminating near and far. The people of the region have long revered and upheld it.

Initially, Wang Pu of Tuyang, Prefect Yan Zhen, and other officials joined forces to construct it, petitioning Master Yunyang to preside over the abbey. After years of effort, it was completed and named Shenqing, bestowed by the Perfected One of Pure Harmony. In the spring of the *yiwei* year, when the Perfected One happened to pass through Heng on his way to Zhongnan, Master Yunyang, along with elders and officials, went forth to greet him. Upon arrival, the Perfected One rested at Shenqing for over a month before entrusting the abbey to his care. Among the abbeys of Fen and Jin that were placed under the Perfected One’s authority, Shenqing was the first.

Shortly thereafter, the Perfected One returned to Changchun Abbey, and Master Yunyang, following his command, appointed Yang Zhiying to oversee the abbey’s affairs. In the autumn of the *gengzi* year, Master Yunyang accompanied the Perfected One of Pure Clarity to Yan, requesting the Perfected One’s journey westward to reinter the ancestral master Chongyang at Liujiang. Prostrating before the hall, he said: “Zhichun, sheltered by the Dao of my father and teacher, has swept and tended Shenqing for several years. Now, with its halls and chambers roughly prepared and the assembly of disciples gathered, the years have been bountiful, and the people dwell in peace and harmony. Yet in this leisure, there is no record to preserve its legacy, and I secretly fear its deeds may fade into oblivion.”

Soon after, through the mediation of Master Baozhen, the overseer of Changchun Abbey, Zhang Defang, he earnestly entreated me for a composition. I have long observed Master Yunyang’s character: his heart is pure and his qi harmonious, his capacity vast and his conduct lofty. Though he blends seamlessly among the crowd without drawing attention, elders from all directions esteem him as a man of the Dao—this is why Shenqing has flourished. The beauty of its mountains and waters, all converging around the abbey, suggests that perhaps heaven designates blessed lands only to bestow them upon men of the Dao.

With its majestic halls and the flourishing of its teachings, Master Yunyang dared not claim Shenqing as his own but offered it to the great patriarch. Those such as Wang Pu, Yan Zhen, and the elders and officials of their time who aided the Dao’s progress—all deserve to be inscribed in grand and enduring terms, their fragrant renown spread without end.

Yet Shenqing as an abbey is already splendid: it possesses the beauty of mountains and waters, the grandeur of halls and chambers, and a man of Dao and virtue to manifest its glory. Combining these three is rare indeed. Now, bathed in the radiant transformation of the great patriarch, it shall stand resolutely between heaven and earth, enduring uniquely through the ages.

I once promised Master Yunyang an abbey record but had long been too occupied to fulfill it. Learning of his return and the earnest pleas relayed by Master Baozhen, I have thus written this brief account. Alas, Master Yunyang has since passed away in the *yiyou* year, and I can no longer inquire into the details. Should I one day journey westward and visit Master Yunyang at Shenqing, beholding its halls and surveying its mountains and waters, if this text remains incomplete, I shall yet add to it.

Recorded on the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month of winter.
*Record of the Newly Renovated Jade Purity Abbey in Jiyang County, Longzhou*
Composed by Li Bangxian of Linkui

The building of a mountain to nine *ren* in height, only to fail at the final basket—this is what the sages deeply lament. When things near completion yet remain unfinished, how could a noble person witnessing this not feel a pang of sorrow and a longing to see them brought to fruition?

The Jade Purity Abbey in Woyang had been under construction for some time. After its completion, there arose the plan to inscribe a record upon stone, with Prefect Chang Yuanheng of Yan’an composing the text, the date for its carving already set. Yet just then, bandits from the northwest arrived, and the work was thus suspended. Even now, the engraving remains unaccomplished—how lamentable this is.

Recently, the Gentleman Yang, son of the late Minister of the Western Province, was dispatched from Chaona to Fengming. Passing through this place, the magistrate guided him to pay a visit. Upon arrival, the halls stood in solemn clarity, the gates and altars in quiet stillness. The cypresses and pines grew dense, the bamboo and trees lush and verdant. Moreover, the waters of the Wo River flowed from the north, their course blocked by a sheer cliff, as if constrained and unable to surge eastward, turning back in a swirling torrent that roared and crashed like rolling thunder. The layout of the abbey, with its distinct precincts, possessed a refined charm: some dwellings faced the mountains, others rested beside the streams; mountain light filled the eyes, the sound of water filled the ears. Looking about, one felt as though the dust of the world had never reached this place, moved to lingering affection and reluctant to depart.

As he walked through the grounds, he came upon a blank stele, smooth and gleaming, yet devoid of inscription. Inquiring of the abbey’s custodians, he obtained the text composed by Prefect Chang. However, the edges of the paper were torn, the characters blurred and faded, with some twelve or thirteen parts entirely lost. Upon reading to the end of each line, the sentences often failed to connect. Even the dates of the abbey’s founding and completion were absent, with only the beginning of the composition noted as the *dingmao* year of the Taihe era.

The Gentleman said, “The stone is already prepared, the text already written—why delay its erection?” The custodians replied that it was due to the disturbances of war. Clutching the paper, he sighed in regret, rolled it up, and tucked it away, then pledged to repair the damaged altars before ordering craftsmen to carve the inscription, determined to see this task completed for them.

One day, while I was at the prefectural seat on business, I paid a visit to the Gentleman at the abbot’s quarters of Pu Zhao Monastery. He showed me this text and charged me with examining it. Its general contents were as follows:

To the southeast of the county lies the stone bank of the Ji River, where the opposing cliffs form a gate-like passage. The locals call it Stone Gate. Some say it was excavated by Yu the Great to guide the Ji into the Wei. Following the bank northward, where the rocks overlook the water, there is a plot of land several *mu* in breadth. Here, the Quanzhen master Pucha first established his hermitage. His conduct was pure and lofty, his devotion to the Dao arduous and rigorous, earning him the reverence of all. Later, robed Daoists and yellow-crowned adepts vied to build their dwellings beside his, each eager to serve as his disciple.

One day, the master gathered his followers and addressed them, saying: "Day after day, we idle away our time in this misty and radiant retreat, doing nothing—by what good fortune do we deserve such joy? Rather than making this a place for one man’s self-cultivation, would it not be better to build a temple for the blessing of all people? I propose we erect an abbey here, so that the divine spirits may have a place to dwell—would this not be fitting?"

The assembly bowed in reverence to the master’s instruction, assented, and withdrew, all pledging their united efforts to support the endeavor. They then went forth to appeal to the people of the county. Near and far, the response was overwhelming; those who came bearing green jade and those who arrived in droves were as numerous as a bustling market. The wealthy contributed their wealth, the poor their labor, and thus timber and stone—all that was needed—were swiftly procured. Halls and shrines, along with all that required construction, were completed in no time.

Thereafter, they petitioned the court for an inscribed plaque, and by imperial favor, it was bestowed with the name *Jade Purity*. Before long, the master suddenly passed away without illness, his breath stilled yet his appearance as lifelike as ever. His fellow disciples, led by Shanqing, and his direct followers, cherishing the master’s virtue, enshrined his image and continued to honor him.

Such were the beginnings and the end as they could be seen. Then the gentleman added, "You should take the original text and revise it for me."

I, however, had never visited the place myself, and what had been recorded was not detailed. I respectfully declined, saying to him: "The Daoist tradition takes stillness and non-action as its foundation. Now, the master exhausted the people’s strength and squandered resources on earth and timber—this is not what it means to know the root. Why compose such a text?"

The gentleman replied, "Not so. The subtle essence of the Old Master’s teaching is ever to excel in saving others, and thus to discard no one."

The master took these words to heart and nurtured the intention to save others. Yet people’s endowments differ: those of profound natural capacity find goodness arising from within and readily enter the Dao, while those of meager disposition resist and cannot align. Thus he employed images of the divine, so that daily they might know reverence and awe outwardly, thereby enriching their inner selves. How could the master have delighted in ostentation and extravagance? He simply followed what people desired to do, never forcing them to contribute beyond their means—how could one slander the master on these grounds?

Moreover, when things are nearly complete yet slightly deficient, to perfect them is also a fine deed of the scholar and gentleman—what need was there to refuse? Hearing the gentleman’s words, and perceiving his heart, I understood that all that had been abandoned could be revived, and all that had fallen could be raised. Thus I took up my brush and roughly set it down.

Recorded on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month in the yiyou year of the Zhengda era.

*Stele of Qingyi Abbey in the Great Capital*
Composed by Shang Ting, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness and Participant in the Administration of Government

In the jimao year, Master Qiu of Changchun arrived from the eastern seas in response to the summons of Emperor Taizu. Crossing the Altai Mountains, he entered the Western Regions, accompanied by eighteen disciples, each assigned to a specific rank and duty. Among them, under the zither and scripture division, was the Perfected One of Harmonious Tranquility, Master Pan.

Upon their return south to Gaili Lake, one night he addressed the assembly, saying: “After the great armies have passed, the people lie in ashes and mire—homeless, foodless, all of them. To establish abbeys and save people, the time must not be lost.”

Here the translation follows:

---

This was the foremost task of cultivation—every person ought to engrave it upon their heart.

After Changchun took up residence in Yan, scholars and commoners who sought refuge, along with Daoist leaders from all directions who came to take refuge, numbered no fewer than a thousand. The abbey’s halls grew so crowded they could scarcely breathe. Master Pan said: “We must not forget our teacher’s words.” He then selected an auspicious site to establish a separate retreat for Changchun.

In the renchen year, a resident of Guangyang Ward offered his dwelling for sale. Master Pan went to inspect it and declared: “The soil is rich, the trees luxuriant, and the qi of purity and seclusion flourishes here—truly a sanctuary for the Dao.” He donated funds to purchase it. A main hall was built, flanked by two side chambers to house the Heavenly Worthy and the images of various deities. Lecture halls, refectories, abbot’s quarters, and guest lodgings were all provided—this was also brought to completion through the worthy efforts of disciples Han, Guo, Yin, Liu, and others who carried forward his vision. A zither terrace was constructed to the north of the hall. Today, the court possesses two famous zithers: *Spring Thunder* and *Jade Vibration*, both kept in the Cheng Hua Palace. During the upheavals of the Zhenyou era, *Jade Vibration* came into Changchun’s possession, and he entrusted it to Master Pan, hence the terrace’s name. Additionally, vegetable gardens were cultivated to sustain the abbey’s yearly needs, and flowers and trees were planted to create a place for leisurely contemplation.

When the abbey was completed, it became the finest in the southwest of the city. A plaque was sought from the Perfected One of Pure Harmony, and thus it was named *Qingyi* (Pure Seclusion). In the autumn of the bingxu year of the Zhiyuan era, disciples Wang Zhihe and two or three companions recorded the abbey’s history and came to request an inscription for the stele.

When asked about the meaning of the name *Qingyi*, I replied: “The qi of Heaven and Earth may be pure or turbid. Those who receive the pure are wise; those who receive the turbid are foolish. Among the wise of the world, there are recluses who shun worldly fame and renounce it, who disdain official rank and refuse to occupy it. They lodge their forms in quiet solitude, entrust their hearts beyond the tumult of the world, and find joy in stillness, peace, and ease. In building this abbey, Master Pan has created a place of profound tranquility with the charm of mountains and forests, refined seclusion without the ostentation of gold and jade. The zither terrace suffices to express his intent; the courtyard trees suffice to gladden the countenance. The flowers and trees of all seasons suffice to welcome guests, while the lanes are quiet, the carriages of the vulgar few, and the clamor of the marketplace distant. Those who come here feel as though they have cast off the dusty fetters and escaped the world’s snares. Their hearts are set free, and they forget to return—how much more so for those who make it their home? Compare them to those who cling to fame and crave wealth, whose inner regrets muddy their minds and whose outward displays of carriages and robes exhaust their spirits in the dust and clatter of horses and wheels. How do they measure against those of pure seclusion?”

The author sighed and said: “The words of Pure Harmony are profound indeed! Let this explanation be carved upon the stone to inform those who come after.” Thus, it was inscribed.

Master Pan’s personal name was Dechong, his courtesy name Zhonghe. He was a native of Zhaizhou in Laizhou. While his mother was pregnant, she dreamed of auspicious clouds covering her body, and after nineteen months, he was born. At seven, he still did not speak, until one day a Daoist passed his door begging. The child suddenly spoke to him from the side, startling his family. The Daoist said: “He is a vessel of the Dao.” He instructed the father to teach him to read, and the boy recited over a thousand words a day. When it came time for him to marry, he secretly traveled to Qixia near the capital abbey to seek an audience with Master Changchun. Passing through Weiyang’s Jade Purity Abbey, the Perfected One of Pure Harmony, Master Yin, introduced him. Initially styled Zhonghe, he later oversaw Daoist affairs in Hedong, residing at the Pure Yang Upper Abbey. He was also known as the Old Man of Nine Peaks and was granted the title Perfected One of Vast Dao and Harmonious Tranquility.

**Inscription:**
How majestic stands the Abbey of Pure Seclusion!
The pure qi of Heaven and Earth is concentrated in Master Pan.
Auspicious clouds covered his mother, and he descended into being.
Receiving the great qi of the Dao, he transcended the ordinary.

Amidst the palaces of immortals, he briefly tarried,
Then quietly withdrew to follow the pines and cypresses afar.
The stone altar stood beneath the high moon, dawn’s dew thick,
While the courtyard’s flowers and trees suffused the spring with warmth.

Worldly gain and fame never reached Penglai’s midst—
Those who race through dust and俗, ah, lament the cage!
The zither terrace preserves an ancient lofty air;
This old brush now inscribes the new abbey, humbled by the task.

**Record of the Restoration of Huaqing Palace**
Composed by Shang Ting, Participant in Determining Governmental Matters and Administrator of the Shaanxi-Sichuan Branch Secretariat

When I first accompanied my late father, the Right Controller, on his official travels to Chang’an, we passed by Huaqing. Wandering through its corridors and pavilions, I read the stone inscriptions left by renowned worthies of the Tang and Song dynasties. The vicissitudes of its rise and fall, its transformations through the ages, stood vividly before my eyes.

Its storied towers and layered pavilions, its tiered terraces and deep pools—though not equal to the splendor of its heyday—still retained the unmistakable traces of its former grandeur. Yet when the imperial troops marched south, the residents were forced to relocate, and the palaces and abbeys everywhere met the common fate of ruin and ashes. As Qin was a strategic crossroads, its destruction was especially severe; even Huaqing, it was said, had been reduced to a wilderness of reeds.

In the year *guichou*, I was dispatched west and again passed by the old palace. I assumed it would be utterly desolate, no trace remaining of its former glory. Yet upon arrival, I saw its halls and chambers restored to order, its steps and courtyards expanded. There were eight halls: the Three Clarities, the Purple Tenuity, the Imperial Portrait, the Four Saints, the Three Officials, the Ancestral Lineage, the Perfected Warrior, and the Jade Maiden. Two pavilions stood as well: the Court of the Primordial and the Sutra Repository. Two bathing pools remained: the Nine Dragons and the Hibiscus. The bell and drum towers were rebuilt, the hall of the Divine Marshal restored, the altar of the stars and the chambers of the clouds, the vegetable gardens and waterwheels—all were arranged in proper sequence. The cinnabar and whitewash, the painted decorations, gleamed with fresh brilliance, as if the palace had never been destroyed—and indeed, it now surpassed its former state.

Upon inquiring into the matter, the palace stewards Zhao Zhigu and others jointly recounted: In the spring of the *xinchou* year, the late Master Qingping, Elder Zhao Zhiyuan, having accompanied the Pure Harmony Patriarch to inter his remains at the ancestral sanctuary, passed through Lishan on his return. Gazing about in dismay, he lamented the palace’s ruin and decay, and resolved to undertake its restoration. He commanded his disciples to clear the brambles, raise the fallen pillars, mold bricks and forge tools, and labor at the walls and enclosures. Thereupon, Daoist masters from all directions, each skilled in their craft, gathered at the palace. Inspired and eager, all pledged their strength, and the work of earth and timber proceeded apace.

What was slanted was set upright; what was rotten was replaced; what was broken was mended; what was faded was adorned. Moreover, the Grand Tutor Yila and the Intendant Tian contributed funds to aid the labor, joining their efforts to bring the project to fruition. Gradually, the halls took shape, and some semblance of order emerged. Before the work was complete, however, the Master passed away, entrusting the task to his disciple Zhang Zhijing. Soon after, Zhang too departed this world. Zhao Zhigu and the others, their strength feeble and their talents meager, feared they could not bear the burden, lest the ancestral legacy be lost.

From then on, they knew no rest, no savor in food, enduring hunger, cold, illness, and hardship without allowing them to hinder their work. For over fifteen years, they toiled until at last the restoration was achieved. They now humbly request this record, hoping to inscribe it in stone, that the Master’s labors and devotion may be transmitted for all time. Yet the times were troubled, and the task remained unfulfilled.

In the first year of *Zhongtong*, I was again entrusted with weighty commissions alongside Minister Lian, overseeing the western frontier. Zhao Zhigu and his fellows once more presented the deeds of their Master and pressed me to complete the record. I reflected: Among the famous mountains and waters of Qin, none surpass Huaqing. Its gates open upon the clear Wei River; from its heights, one overlooks the lands of Shang and Yu. Lofty eaves and towering beams stretch in verdant grandeur, while ancient vines and gnarled trees entwine and sway. Here lie the detached palaces and retreats of the Han and Tang—such are the marvels of Huaqing, amply described by those before me.

Moreover, as the thoroughfare where east and west converge, it stands at a vital crossroads. Yet it maintains pure chambers for visiting officials, stores fodder and medicines for travelers, offering food to the hungry, warmth to the cold, rest to the weary—all find solace, their needs met as if by some unseen grace. Such adaptability, responding to the times, transforming with circumstance, and serving all without fail—this is its nature.

Had not the numinous efficacy of Qingping moved hearts, how could the palace have been renewed and its former glory restored? Had not Zhao Zhigu and his fellows exhausted their strength and toiled to the point of exhaustion, how could the halls have been rebuilt and the ancestral traditions revived? To remain silent would be to let the labors of master and disciples fade into obscurity.

Thus, I have briefly recounted the course of the restoration, to be engraved in stone as a record of these years. Written on a day in the ninth month of the second year of *Zhongtong*.

*Preface to the Biographies of the Seven Perfected*

To the south, at Mount Fenglong, this was composed by Li Ye, styled Renqing.

When the mountain cart lowers its hook without carving, without artifice—this is called the true. When an infant wails in longing for its mother, a bond born with birth itself—this too is called the true. In the age of the Supreme Sovereign, the One True and All-Encompassing reigned supreme; its transformation ran deep, its customs were level and harmonious. Wild deer roamed the branches, all returning to nature. Things existed without pretense—what was there to do? Even if Jiezi had acted or Jizhen had refrained, it would have made no difference.

As the world declined and the Dao’s protective web frayed, the One True collapsed within, and a myriad of falsehoods, coarse and refined, ran rampant in wanton abandon. They boasted of their billions, dissecting deceit and fraud, disrupting the pristine simplicity of the Great Plain. At such a time, had there been no perfected beings to ferry them across the fordless ford, to return them to the ancient abode, then day by day, month by month, habit would have hardened into custom, and the benighted masses would have become something other than human. Yet the heavens could be leaned upon like a pestle—no need to wait a thousand years. Thus, in the age of Emperor Hong, Guangcheng came to the rescue; in the age of the Ji and Zhou, Hundun came to the rescue; in the age of the Warring States, Nanhua and Chongxu came to the rescue. And the Seven Perfected followed in their footsteps, each in turn rescuing the present age. Though their encounters differed, their rescue was one and the same.

From the time of Chongyang, the Primordial Ancestor, who first opened the true seal in the early years of the Jin dynasty’s Zhenglong and Dading eras, to Elder Changchun, who spread the true wind during the founding of our dynasty’s reign, they molded and shaped the multitudes, preserving the Great Harmony and rectifying the lives of countless beings. Yet among the remnants of war’s captives, the last gasps of the frozen and starving, the fleeting breaths of the slandered and oppressed—those they raised from the agony of withered flesh and brittle bones to grant the blessing of peace and joy—none could fully recount.

Thus, the Seven Perfected’s salvation of the world truly aligns with the heart of the Supreme Emperor. The Supreme Emperor’s love for the people is realized through the teachings of the Seven Perfected. Otherwise, why would Heaven have brought forth a sagely emperor to pacify the Four Seas, and Heaven have brought forth Changchun to stand at the side of the great mandate, joining their essences and spirits in a shared beginning and end? After Changchun ascended, Qinghe preserved the kalpa’s treasures, Zhenchang unfolded them, and now Chengming has disseminated them far and wide. Thus, the magnificent deeds of the Seven Perfected shine as brightly as the sun and moon in the sky. Even without written compilations, they would not fade into obscurity—how much more so when their biographies are meticulously recorded and their immortal words ring clear?

The various gentlemen have recounted their lives in full detail, yet I have appended these additional remarks, like the sun’s rays striking the eastern slopes, merely to harmonize with their voices. As for the teachings of the empty boat and the numinous wind, of daily renewal and ceaseless transformation—these are the mysteries within mysteries. Though I am old, I have still gained a drop of their benefit.

The *Book of Songs* says:
*"Beckoning, beckoning, the boatman—*
*Others cross, but I will not.*
*Others cross, but I will not—*
*I await my friend."*

I bow my head to Chengming: do not say I am unworthy.
Written on a day in the year *Yichou* of the *Zhiyuan* era.

**Preface to the Departure of Perfected Yu to Beijing**

In the *Wuxu* year, on the first day of the third month, the Keeper of the Keys of Beijing, Lord Wu, sent an envoy to Changchun, presenting an embroidered letter inviting Perfected Yu of the Cavern of Truth to serve as a model for the people of his land. The request was granted.

On the fifteenth day of the fourth month, Lord Wu personally arrived with carriages and horses to welcome him. I have heard that Perfected Yu, a native of Ninghai, entered the Dao at Guanyin Temple and has resided in Guanzhong for over fifty years, never once venturing beyond his village. His ascetic discipline and resolute will are matched by few; his pure conduct and benevolent reputation are renowned near and far. During the *Zhengda* era, he was summoned by imperial decree to oversee the Central Taiyi Temple in Bianjing. In the *Renchen* year, as the great army crossed south, the elders of Changchun Palace in Beijing longed for him deeply. Later, hearing that the strict Commissioner had escorted him back to Dongping, they all rejoiced. When he arrived in Yan to pay respects at Chushun Hall, the palace residents pleaded for him to stay, but he declined. He has now been back in the south for five years.

Daoist priests revere his rigor as if he were a divine being; the people of the capital gaze upon his demeanor as if beholding an immortal. One day, when he ordered his carriage prepared, gibbons and cranes lamented in sorrow, pines and chrysanthemums fell into desolation. The crowd firmly resolved to prevent his departure, but his resolve could not be shaken. Some even sought to physically restrain him to keep him from leaving.

I see in this man a heart that regards the world as one, ever using his surplus to supplement what is lacking. Changchun and Qinghe once left the Western Hall; Li Zhen (?) once presided over the dharma seat; the other venerable worthies cannot be enumerated. This elder, like a vast ocean treasury, may lose one pearl, but our light suffers no diminution—another chamber’s lamp still illuminates the night with abundance.

Moreover, the people of Bailiu are simple and honest, eager to do good and receptive to the Dao, making it easy for them to follow its path. With Lord Wu, the Marquis, and the Canal Commissioner leading by example in revering the worthy and attracting the virtuous, and with the guidance of enlightened teachers, transforming customs and mending habits would be as effortless as turning a hand.

Some say: "Perfected Yu is as serene as a white cloud, coming and going without attachment. How could he stoop to lecture and admonish you, and would the careless masses truly heed his teachings?" I reply: "When the bright moon rises, it appears in every body of water. The moon does not seek the water, nor can the water escape it. The moon is the great illumination that descends upon all, the ultimate stillness that moves all. Those who receive it in their hearts and spirits cannot help but be transformed. Why insist on rigid instruction? Perfected Yu’s heart holds its own bright moon; human nature is like water. The world is one—why doubt the people of Bailiu alone?"

Upon hearing this, even those who grieved at the loss of their elder rejoiced, for they saw that where a noble man dwells, transformation through the Dao naturally follows. Thus, they gathered to open the guest hall, set out a farewell feast, composed songs and poems to send him off, and honored his journey. I have written this preface and also presented a poem:

*The Perfected departs for Bailiu,*
*The high official holds the reins.*
*Wealth and honor dare not make him proud—*
*In secret, he yearns to join the black-smelting immortals.*

Who would say the misty leopard hides in seclusion,
Only to suddenly soar with the cloud-borne swans?
Why linger at the farewell feast, pacing to and fro—
Unwilling to part so soon, unable to bear the haste of separation.
Willows in the mist gaze toward the long pavilion,
Where catkins drift in boundless flight.

**Zhenchang, Li Zhichang**
At the crossroads, clasping hands in parting as spring begins its return,
Peach blossoms fade while willow floss takes flight.
From afar, his carriage and horses move swift as arrows—
When shall we meet again, like Ding Lingwei?

**Another**
His heart has departed, his resolve hard to stay;
Seizing spring’s moment, he sets forth on a distant journey.
Autumn winds stir his silver hair,
While gibbons and cranes grieve in his stead.

**Ding’an, Hao Zhang**
At the farewell feast, we clasp hands again and again,
The east wind offers no solace—longing lingers.
Accustomed to the cry of the dark crane in the secluded courtyard,
He now soars alone as an immortal’s radiance.
When shall we wander again north of the gardens?
When will he return to his old retreat in Zhongnan?
Your departure stirs my longing for home—
Unbidden, I stand in the wind and chant *"Shiwei."*

**Feng Lan, Feng Zhiheng**
For long you presided over the Mystic Palace of ancient Bian,
Yet no place is beyond the refuge of the Perfected Immortal.
Like the moon in water, manifesting wherever it flows,
Or a lone cloud in the sky, drifting without cease.
The orchid canopy grows cold at night, deepening the crane’s lament;
The ancestral court awaits your return as spring warms.
Do not forget your vow in Guanzhong—
Hasten to claim the emerald peaks of Zhongnan.

**Hedong, Duan Tianchang**
The crane of the thousand-year pillar,
Graceful, resumes its ancient journey.
The northern skies stretch vast and clear,
While Yan’s markets bid farewell to lingering.
You ascend lightly, first to attain the Way,
While I, yet earthbound, cannot follow.
Gazing into the cloud-sea’s endless path,
Evening mist brings unbroken sorrow.

**Preface to the Poems on Encountering the Immortal Palace at Ganhe Town, Zhongnan Mountain**
Composed by Li Ding, the Empty Boat Daoist of Taiyuan.

At the crow of the rooster, the Six Directions emerge from darkness; with the strum of a zither, the myriad things enter their nurturing growth. How is it that worldly affairs, vast enough to fill heaven and earth, may first stir from the most minute beginnings? For even the smallest thing may harbor the profoundest principle—there lies within it that which unfolds of itself, beyond all knowing.

Such is the power of the waters of Gan. The Dao of our Ancestral Master Chongyang, transmitted through the ages, shall endure for a hundred thousand generations without end—this I dare not presume to foretell. Yet from the Zhenglong era onward, through three or four transmissions over a century, what has been witnessed by all attests to its truth: from his disciples who attained realization—Masters Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma, and the true teachers who followed—there have been hundreds, even thousands. Those whose bones were revived from death by his grace number in the tens of thousands. The palaces and temples built in his name count in the hundreds. All beings with rounded skulls and square toes, should they cast aside the veils of self-deception and turn toward him, find themselves bathed in boundless radiance, their needs met as soon as they arise. Truly, does not his influence fill heaven and earth?

Yet the initial impulse of this great unfolding began when these waters met the two immortals, who drank but a single cup and set it in motion. Thus, Master Hong of the Cavern of Reality established this palace upon the very site to mark the event. The great scholar Hong Ru, in turn, composed poems in its praise. Now, the Heavenly Music Daoist, Master Li Hefu, has asked me to write this preface. I offer this reflection:

Water, from the moment the Two Modes took their places, has been essential to life—without water and fire, humanity cannot endure. Yet water’s utility precedes even fire’s in its service to the world. Thus, nothing benefits the world more than water. This, however, is merely water’s ordinary nature. All things possess both constancy and transformation. Constancy requires no discourse; transformation, being numinous, demands it.

In the transformation of water lies a principle both numinous and unfathomable, which those who cultivate the Dao must explore. If we call water numinous, how then does the water of the Greedy Spring fail to corrupt the purity of Boyi and Shuqi? Yet if we deny its numinosity, how does the water of the Upper Pool empower Bian Que’s healing arts? I say this numinous transformation is the workings of heaven’s mechanism.

The Ancestral Master embodied wholeness before the arising of any thing, latent yet awaiting its moment. When at last he encountered this place of awakening, the crane’s cry and the disciple’s response resonated in mutual summoning, irresistible. Thus arose the greatness we see today. Had it been otherwise, countless others must have drunk these waters since their origin—why should they have favored our Ancestral Master alone?

As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The numinous and the luminous reside in the person."* Does this not speak to this very truth?

Written on the Lantern Festival of the Xinyou year of the Zhongtong era, with reverent bows.

**Zhang Zheng, Left Controller of the Shaanxi Branch Secretariat, presents:**

Zifang fled Qin’s ruin, once retrieving shoes beneath a bridge.
Aiding Han, he laid its vast foundations, a pillar of heaven.
Intent on roaming with Red Pine, he cast off his robes when his work was done.
Rare men and rare texts—creation does not lightly bestow them.

Chongyang arose, reviving the Perfect Realization—his strides as bold as commerce’s expanse.
A hero of towering presence, he might have seized power when the time was ripe.
Yet he saw the folly of his path, withdrew his heart, and lived beyond death’s dusk.
It is said that at the outset of his Dao, he met two immortals here.
Now, beneath Zhongnan’s peaks, halls and pavilions pierce the mist.

Having endured great trials, I have washed away the cares of the dusty world.
Should my carriage turn west in return, I would dwell in a thatched hut,
Before the bright moon and clear wind, staff in hand along the Gan River’s path.

---

**Zhang Zheng, Left Controller of the Shaanxi Branch Secretariat, presents:**

Towers and pavilions rise majestically by the Gan River’s banks,
Where Chongyang once met celestial beings.
A draught of jade nectar dispelled the clouds of delusion,
And as his drunken eyes opened, the Dao’s sun dawned anew.

His journey from the western reaches of Qin wearied his jade-like steps,
Yet he returned directly to the Eastern Sea to angle for golden carp.
His spirit, nurturing and transforming like timely rain,
Once more followed the trail of the Primordial One.

---

**Meng Panlin, Hanlin Academician, presents:**

The wellspring of the Dao was about to open, its true vessel prepared—
Was their meeting by the green waters mere chance?
Clouds drift aimlessly from mountain hollows,
Yet pearls form in the dark through no will of their own.

The two immortals’ secret teachings were passed on in person,
And with a single drink, the numinous mechanism was silently transmitted.
Only the profound abyss flows far and wide—
How many seas have turned to mulberry fields in the tumult of time?

---

**Li Ting, Professor of the Jingzhao Prefecture School, presents:**

The limpid stream soaks the ancient moss,
Where immortals met and lingered.
From a single gourd of jade liquid, they drank in turn,
And seven golden lotuses bloomed in succession.

The path back through the cloud-sea is hard to find,
While heaven and earth retain only the ashes of kalpas past.
Only the crane of the thousand-year pillar,
Shall return once more to its homeland.

---

**Wang Bowen, Surveillance Commissioner of the Shaanxi-Hanzhong Circuit, presents:**

Scarcely beyond the mountain’s edge, it begins as a trickle,
Yet swelling here, it becomes a vast expanse.
Before it, the seven-jeweled trees flourish,
Behind, golden lotuses bloom in myriad splendor.

Boast not of the Elixir Well’s taste in Gou Lou,
Nor praise the chrysanthemum pool’s fragrance in Nanyang.
Who now shares Chongyang’s resolve?
Come, draw from the pure and cool stream, and taste the true lineage.

---

**Chen Sui, Grand Master for Palace Attendance and Participant in the Privy Council, presents:**

His beard bristles like halberds, his eyes gleam like ice,
A presence as awe-inspiring as the star of Han’s age.
He must have been an ancient immortal all along,
Further blessed by feathered adepts who unlocked his numinous power.

A single gourd of divine nectar opened the mysterious realm,
And for ten thousand ages, the Central Plains have venerated his ancestral court.
I hear that those left dazed by the kalpa’s devastation
Are awakened by these waters to clarity.

---

**Wang Liyong, Hanlin Academician and Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, presents:**

Externally whole in humanity, internally whole in heaven.

**Magistrate of Luoyang, Yi of Qi, presents:**

White jade lies within stone, the dark pearl within the abyss.
With a single reflection of the Sea Toad, Chongyang ascends as immortal.
The Dao is awakened through water, and water is the key to the Dao.
Let none abandon themselves—Gan River holds its spring.

**Hanlin Academician and Drafter of Edicts Yao Sui presents:**

Do not envy the single sweet draught of Cao Creek—
To drink the West River dry is but empty talk.
Beneath the Bridge of Encountering Immortals, the flowing waters,
The true lineage holds its guiding compass.

The surging forth from Zhongnan knows no end,
Its source a ceaseless torrent through the Central Plains.
Reversing Jing to merge with Wei, bound for the sea,
It flows toward the summit of Penglai.

Before meeting the immortal perfected, what could one do?
Even Yi Ya’s tongue would falter in delay.
Take up your gourd and drink by the bridge’s edge—
The water’s savor surpasses wine tenfold.

**Hanlin Academician and Drafter of Edicts Yao Sui presents:**

Beneath Zhongnan Mountain, the sweet spring’s water,
I draw with my jar, comparing it to well and spring.
How is it that the immortal elder, when he drinks,
With a single sip leaves the world’s finest wines behind?

What guiding track fails to form a river?
Northward it flows to the Wei, paying homage as its source.
Though the Eastern Sea lies thousands of *li* distant,
Its lingering waves unfold seven golden lotuses.

The river’s source and course remain unseen by men,
Its flavor too subtle for mortal discernment.
If the immortal elder rides the clouds to return,
Even the dregs of his cup would demand a taste.

**Grand Master for Splendid Counsel, Prefect of the Anxi Circuit Li Dun, presents:**

The great Dao stretches boundless, veiled by layers of dust,
Where on the world’s path may one seek the ford of confusion?
Since that single draught from the celestial gourd,
Turning back to the western wind, I have awakened to truth.

The old man of Wei sought immortality through a thousand deaths,
While Changfang suffered in vain to meet Master Hu.
How much better a single drop from the sweet waters of Gan River—
It bears the power to transcend the mortal and enter the sage.

**Vice Prefect of the Anxi Circuit Wang Pin, presents:**

The five thousand words of the Primordial’s bequeathed teaching,
Through ten thousand ages, have rarely received true transmission.
The great Dao, though obscure, still has its root,
And the perfected, when they meet, find their destined path.

Alas for Han Wu, who vainly patrolled the seas,
And the laughable Wang Qiao, who idly pursued immortality.
Who recognizes the path beneath Zhongnan Mountain?
A single gourd of sweet water is the true key.

**Judicial Officer of the Anxi Circuit Kou Yuande, presents:**

A commoner adrift, spending his coin on wine,
Once met the immortal elder, who upturned his jade flask.
Lead and mercury, once obscure, received secret transmission,
And from that moment, saint and mortal diverged.

Melting ice into water is no different in essence,
While transmuting iron into gold is no mere fancy.
For a thousand ages, the path by the Gan River,
Amid the world’s clamor, I sigh for our kind.

**Storyteller of the Prince of Anxi’s Mansion, Liu Fen, presents:**

Who painted the immortal elder,
Drunk on the waters of Gan River?
Chongyang’s noble frame transformed,
And the mystic wind arose across the four seas.

In the east, Master Danyang,
Whose heart died in the ancestral court.
Changchun, holding rare *qi*,
Aided the mandate like a fortress.

The great teaching opened the Quanzhen,
And all turned to it like grass to the wind.
Quanzhen holds true joy—
How could rank or wealth compare?

The three sacred palaces stand tall,
Divided like a tripod’s legs.
If men ask where this water lies,
How many grasp its meaning?

I recall standing by the river’s bank,
Its clarity mirroring the jagged stones.
Clouds and thunder stirred the waves ahead,
And vainly I sought to dip my fingers.
Later, its depths grew mightier still,
And I gazed up at the Heavenly Music Master.

**Guest of Chang’an, Qiao Zai, presents:**

The towering peaks of Louguan, purple and grand,
After the immortal perfected departed, only empty rosy clouds remained.
Without a single sip from the gourd’s water,
Who could fathom the five ancestors’ thousand-year merit?

The golden palace stands beneath the moon of the imperial domain,
The stone altar rises with the wind of Han’s mausoleums.
Diligently renewing the triple offering of reverence,
Once more the phoenix is permitted to gather in the old palace.

**Commissioner for Religious Affairs of the Shaanxi Xingyuan and Other Circuits, He Daoning, presents:**

Master Chongyang, the ancestral teacher, met Pure Yang,
And the secret formula first spread its fragrance across the earth.
Beyond the seas, seven jade trees flourished,
While in the world, ten thousand jade lotuses bloomed.

Heaven and man merged in samadhi,
The torch’s flame and light fused as one.
The ceaseless flow of the sweet Gan River,
Reveals a source both deep and far-reaching.

**Daoist of the Celestial Music of Yimen, Li Daoqian, presents:**

Countless layers of mist rise against the azure sky,
Purple clouds deeply shroud the Palace of Encountering Immortals.
After the sword-bearing immortals returned to the three mountains,
The Quanzhen Dao’s transformation spread across the four seas.

Awakening from dreams of cranes crying over the cinnabar well’s dew,
After the rites, the wind danced upon the stone altar.
In the world, ten thousand golden lotuses flourish—
All through the irrigation of the sweet spring’s merit.

**Former Commissioner for Daoist Affairs of the Various Circuits, Wei Zhiyi, presents:**

The unfolding of the Dao’s fortune reveals heaven’s mechanism,
And the true man’s encounter seemed fated.
The Purple Ultimate’s precious chart was secretly bestowed,
And the Primordial’s divine tripod received renewed support.

Tao Hongjing marveled at the waters of Qiandu,
While Bian Que labored in vain over the upper pool’s drink.
Since the meeting by the sweet riverbank,
The immortal wind has flourished across China and the barbarian lands.

**Commissioner for Daoist Affairs of the Anxi Circuit, Sun Dehuo, presents:**

Zhuangzi of the southern gardens never returned,
And the dragon-like heart’s method lost its true transmission.
The Dao waned through the ages, grieving over division,
Until the celestial court sent Chongyang to restore its wholeness.

The sweet waters descended beyond the dark sea,
And the perfected met before the Crimson Clarity.
Who could know that a single intoxication would stir the mystic wind,
Blowing open ten thousand golden lotuses?

**Postscript**

Composed by disciple Zhang Haogu of Jian’an.

Amidst the vast corpus of recorded works—though they span ancient and modern times, their waves converging like clouds—many suffer from prolixity, their words entangled in trivial details, wearying the discerning reader. My master, the Perfected of Heavenly Music, while presiding over the ancestral court’s canonical teachings in Qin and Shu, and amidst his engagements with worldly affairs, ever held composition close to his heart. He reflected that since the founding of the teaching by Patriarch Chongyang, the Daoist law had flourished so abundantly that from the Quanzhen lineage emerged masters and venerable figures, their ranks stretching shoulder to shoulder. In the immortal homeland, Daoist abbeys numbered in the hundreds, and all that was inscribed in metal and stone has since spread fragrance without end. Yet across the vastness of the realm and the distant four quarters, few have been granted even a fleeting glimpse of this grandeur.

Thus, he gathered writings composed by renowned worthies of the age, transcribing them by hand—accounts of virtuous conduct, records of abbeys and temples—comprising over ninety pieces in all: stele inscriptions, biographies, eulogies, and hymns of praise. Each surpasses the ordinary in its deeds, its language majestic and refined, sufficient to command trust across all under heaven and for generations to come. These he compiled into a single volume, titling it *Records of the Immortal Source of the Sweet Waters*. For the Sweet Waters mark the place where the Patriarch encountered the Perfected, and the Immortal Source signifies the true transmission of the Quanzhen lineage. This compilation, like the works of the Daoist scholars who traced the *Yi-Luo* wellsprings, is most aptly named.

Recently, the text was carved into blocks to disseminate its transmission. As the humble one charged with collating its passages, I labored from summer to winter, a span of twenty-six months and six days. Now that the work is complete, I have been commanded to append this postscript. Reflecting on my master’s intent—to uphold the mystic net and propagate the ancestral Dao—his contribution is no small one. Should those of aspiration newly encounter this book, they will not only grasp the magnificence of the ancients’ achievements but also witness the trust they inspired. Though they never left their chambers, the heart-method of the Mysterious Origin is here in abundance, a wellspring of instruction. Its flow shall never cease; what age shall lack its inheritors? Gazing upon the present, how could we know it does not surpass the past? May those who follow continue its thread, that this transmission may endure without end.

Respectfully inscribed six days after the Winter Solstice in the year *jichou*.
