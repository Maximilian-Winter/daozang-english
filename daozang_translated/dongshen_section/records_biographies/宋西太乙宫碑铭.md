**Inscription for the Western Taiyi Palace of the Song**
Composed by Minister Song Shou, Hanlin Academician, Concurrent Reader-in-Waiting, and Judge of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Palace

In the fourth generation of the Song, the sixth year of the Tiansheng reign, third month of spring, a Taiyi Palace was erected at the southwestern corner of the capital.

According to the astrologers’ tradition, Taiyi resides to the right of the Gate of the Purple Palace, as the spirit of the Northern Asterism. It governs the laws of the sixteen spirits, weighing and balancing their authority to establish the imperial standard.

The masters of yin-yang declare Taiyi the emissary of the Primordial Sovereign, wielding the reckoning rod and upholding firmness to rectify the constancy of Heaven and Earth. It unifies the eight trigrams and solemnly completes the myriad things.

The Daoist tradition holds that the primordial *qi* originates from the One, which transforms into the Nine. Thus, Taiyi traverses the Nine Palaces. Its altars and ritual platforms for prayer and offering encompass the ranks of perfected immortals and their divine retinue. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the five *qi*, communed with the ten thousand spirits, and first devised the double divination template, exhaustively mastering its permutations. He established gates and appointed generals—harmonizing the signs of radiance and disturbance, determining the auspices of transverse and longitudinal lodgings, and the portents of fortune and misfortune. Posterity revered and illuminated these mysteries.

The invocations and titles of the deities number eighty-one in total, yet the revered spirits are ten, their names derived from the Ten Origins and Six Cycles, the Five Phases and Three Governances. Generally, they rest above in the stellar enclosure and follow below the palace origins; wherever they descend, their oversight is unwavering. They govern human affairs to foresee the future, aid the divine Dao to punish excess, ensuring none fail to prosper and flourish, while those who follow the Way receive no favor—scholars such as Zhang Heng, Li Yun, and Xiao Zixian have expounded upon this in detail.

Among the Five Fortunes, the first moves as Wood, embodies virtue as Benevolence, traverses the Five Palaces, and originates with the Five Celestial Stems. Every two hundred seventy cycles of the *jiazi*, it shifts its position. The palace begins at the *qian* position, rotating left through the three corners, arriving at the center, then circling anew. Beneath its path, there are no sounds of metal, armor, or the clatter of war; all things flourish abundantly, and the people live in joy.

In the eighth year of Taizong’s reign, the court astronomers calculated that in the *jiashen* year, the deity would depart the wilds of Liaojie and enter the lodge of *Dou-Niu*. Thus, a palace was constructed in the *xun* direction to await the arrival of the governing *qi*. The images of the Two Wanderers, Four Spirits, and Three Boards were set forth, demonstrating the rites of response. This was recorded in prior accounts and entrusted to the relevant offices.

Consider how Emperor Wu of Han established the sacrifices to the Three Ones, adorning the halls and chambers. This practice extended to the Tang people, and after the *Qianyuan* era, altars were built in the capital’s outskirts, with the emperor personally conducting the rites. During the *Dali* era, an abbey was founded in Shicheng, its years commemorated in records—all these were clearly documented in official annals.

After examining and refining these precedents, the rites were established as appropriate. On the days of the Four Outskirts’ Welcoming of *Qi*, sacrifices were conducted: the sacrificial animals were prepared, silk and jade offerings measured, and the invocators and scribes recited their words, while attending ministers bore witness. The ceremony was half the scale of the Grand Sacrifice.

At the Three Origins, elaborate offerings were made: incense burners, floral lamps, patterned silks, and blue-green banners. The ritual codes were proclaimed by the ritual leaders, and eunuchs assisted. The rites followed those of the *Lingbao* tradition.

When Zhenzong ascended the throne, for all major state affairs, he first reported to the deities; for every court celebration, he personally paid homage. The emperor diligently upheld these grand rites, never neglecting the regular offerings. By the *wuchen* year of the dragon cycle, he departed from the Yellow Chamber, journeyed west to *kun-ou*, and acceded to the local petition to augment the sacrificial texts. At the outskirts, a separate altar was constructed. After divining the orientation and timing, it was situated a day’s journey near the Gate of Auspicious Autumn. To protect the state’s artisans and gather the laborers, materials were assembled, and all necessary items prepared.

The emperor appointed Zhang Huaide, Director of the Imperial Pharmacy, to oversee the project. Palace attendants Huangfu Jihe and Chen Yanda, of high and inner ranks respectively, supervised the construction. Skilled craftsmen applied their artistry, and the work was swiftly completed with divine efficacy. Four halls were built, each adorned with inscribed plaques. The Yellow Court stood at the center to honor the Great Wanderer, the Five Fortunes, and the Five Boards. Behind it, the Ningxi Hall was established to serve the Lesser Wanderer. To the east, the Yanji Hall housed the Celestial One and the Four Spirit Ministers’ Boards. To the west, the Ziyou Hall accommodated the Earthly One and the Direct Alignment Board. Additionally, the sacred and perfected spirits, the luminous constellations, and the mountain and river deities were depicted in intricate murals along the corridors for the accompanying sacrifices.

The main gates were named *Xianzhen*, *Yanhui*, and *Jingji*, while the separate hall was called *Qingxiu*, serving as the fasting quarters. Beyond these, auxiliary halls and lodgings totaled over four hundred. Thirty meticulously selected Daoist priests, including the *Yuanjing* Master Xu Sijian, were stationed there. The rituals and offerings followed the precedents of the *Yongxi* era.

Previously, the site had been confined to the *zhen* palace. After carefully transcribing the memorials, on the *renyin* day of late autumn, with the Three Caverns’ solemn rites and the Nine Divisions’ inner music, the images of the Wanderer Boards and deities were escorted to their respective halls.

The following day, the imperial carriage arrived. The emperor prostrated himself in reverence before the images. At dawn the next day, he personally attended to the empress dowager, joining her in paying homage. He appointed Zhang Shixun, Minister of Rites and Chief Councilor, as his emissary, outfitting him with the yellow banner and ceremonial regalia. The imperial guard, ten thousand strong, escorted the procession on foot to the palace gates. The assisting ministers saw them off beyond the palace gates. The two august personages then ascended the Chongguan Tower, and the imperial procession circled back, the imperial road cleared as they returned.

That evening, they rested at the New Inn. As the night watch ended and the sun began to rise, the emperor’s lodgings were prepared, and the fasting and offerings commenced. At the first light of the following month, the emperor returned again.

On the *dinghai* day of the second month in the seventh year, the empress dowager’s carriage followed. Wherever she passed, she inspected the fields and accompanied the ministers, issuing decrees to spread beneficence. She humbled herself without regard for personal loss, journeyed far without fear of toil, ever reverent and solemn.

What is here recorded is this: our dynasty, descended from the enlightened, upholds sincerity and reverence, deepening its greatness. Our imperial ancestors, Taizu and Taizong, both received the bright mandate, diligently honoring the rites and cherishing the people. They bore the sum of all blessings, secured the favor of the myriad origins, and extended their vast legacy to our emperor. He inherits the august spirit of his ancestors, receives the virtuous teachings of the empress dowager, and governs with reverence and awe, ensuring peace and harmony—this has been so for many years.

As for the empress dowager’s illustrious sagacity, benevolence, and compassion, she shields and supports the emperor, upholding the trust of her predecessors. The emperor, in his wisdom, filial piety, and love, honors her maternal dignity, harmonizing all state affairs. In action, he considers precedent; in repose, he contemplates longevity. He purifies and elevates the Dao, illuminates and esteems culture. Thus, his fragrant virtue reaches above and below, rare treasures are offered in abundance, and auspicious omens respond. Yet he remains meticulous in assembling grand offerings, carefully observing the exorcisms, harmonizing the deities, and ordering the hundred rites. Where rites are due, they are fitting; what the spirits receive is abundant. Therefore, this magnificent and profound edifice is erected to manifest reverence, and its rich splendor is presented as tribute.

The old histories state: “The spirits of heaven and earth follow the king’s presence.” The sacrifices to the Four Directions are not fixed in name but adapt to their location—what difference is there between near and far?

The construction of these two temple-palaces invariably adheres to auspicious sites—could this not be because the king, ruling the Four Seas, cherishes the myriad clans, and in serving the Three Impartial Ones, acts without partiality? The breadth of blessings sought knows no bounds; how could the response of hidden truths and the descent of retribution be confined to one corner? Even the lands of *Chunwei* and *Jingluo*, though remote, stand to the right of the imperial domain. When timely bestowals are distributed, none is deemed unworthy. In serving the spirits and protecting the people, this is the utmost—thus, the institutions of the True Ancestor and the models of the Cultured Ancestor are those who excel in continuation and succession.

The subtle and wondrous workings of the profound are extended through the silent establishment of protection and support, while the utmost sincerity in reverence and esteem is proclaimed. The historian, following the imperial decree and relying on the texts, inscribes the stone, saying:

Behold the majestic new palace, so solemn!
The wilds lie level, the qi lush and verdant.
Vast and resplendent, its glory blazes—
The spirits abide here in ease and delight.

Roofs like clouds, tiles like scales, span the crimson heavens;
Deep-hued curtains serve as mats, jade feasts spread wide.
The empty songs and feathered dances proceed in fragrant harmony,
All things complete, the sincerity pure and auspicious.

This abode of the celestial pivot faces the purple cosmos,
Embracing the myriad states under its blessed protection.
May our lord serve the Cultured Mother,
And his longevity and prosperity equal the boundless heavens.
