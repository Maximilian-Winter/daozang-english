**Record of Longjiao Mountain**

By the decree of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong (明皇), inscribed for the *Qing Tang Guan* (庆唐观) and commemorating the sacred mark:

The term **"Divine"** (神) refers to the wondrous manifestation of existence, while **"Transformation"** (化) is the boundless shaping of forms. Who could claim dominion over the Divine’s essence, or fathom the subtle wisdom guiding Transformation? If the forms of Transformation were to vanish, then the Divine and its workings might well cease to exist.

To exhaust the Divine and perfect Transformation—who but the most exalted of sages could achieve this?

My distant ancestor, the Emperor Xuanyuan (玄元皇帝), whom the Daoists revere as the **Laozi, the Highest Venerable** (太上老君), established his doctrine upon the **Eternal Non-Existence** (常无有), and his conduct upon **unfathomable obscurity** (不缴昧). Knowing the strength of the masculine yet embracing the feminine, he became the **valley of the world**; knowing the brilliance of whiteness yet embracing humiliation, he became the **humble foundation of the world**. Thus, he endured the ancient ages while ever renewing himself, refined the myriad forms yet preserved their purity, nurtured all things without causing harm, and bestowed blessings upon countless generations without claiming virtue.

How lofty—his summit unseen, his depths unfathomable! Returning to the formless, he established his teachings at the **boundary of the Dao**, encompassing the **Great Clarity** (太清), and awaited the sacred moment of manifestation.

From my august ancestor, who **drew his sword to rise from Jin**, to my grandfather, who **wielded iron to conquer Qin**, their might soared like the *peng* bird seizing the winds, their glory clashed with the sun and moon. The ministers of Xia were shamed and departed, while the **Yin tripod** (殷鼎) trembled but did not move.

Then, the **Laozi** appeared in radiant splendor—his hair white as jade, his beard crimson—beholding this **Longjiao Mountain**, and revealing the **Dragon’s Auspicious Omen** (龙兴之兆). He spoke to Ji Shanxing (吉善行) of **Datong Fortress, Glazhou** (绛州大通堡), saying: *"I am the ancestor of the Tang Emperor. Tell your descendants that they shall long hold dominion over the world."*

Thus, when the **red banner was unfurled**, the people’s hearts settled; when the **white banner was raised**, the six directions fell into order.

As the saying goes:
*"The sound of sound reaches no farther than a hundred li,
But the soundless sound extends to the four seas."*

Was it not the **Divine’s resounding virtue**, drawing all under its sway?

In the third year of **Wude** (武德, 620), on the second day of the second month, Ji Shanxing received the **Divine’s instruction**, fearing no clear evidence, and dared not disclose it.

In the fourth month, the **Laozi** appeared again, saying: *"The stone tortoise emerges—my words are true."*

At that time, **Taizong** (太宗) was the **Prince of Qin**, campaigning against **Song Jinguang** (宋金刚), commanding the armies of **Fen and Glazhou**. The **Prefect of Jinzhou**, He Ruo Xiaoyi (贺若孝义), reported the sighting, and immediately dispatched his trusted officer, **Du Ang** (杜昂), to the mountain to pay homage.

In the midst of his reverence, the **Divine’s sacred form** was clearly revealed. Du Ang returned in haste, declaring: *"It is indeed true!"*

Wielding the white-haired banner, the **Dao** spread peace throughout the Six Unities.

The saying goes: *"The sound that can be heard does not exceed a hundred miles, but the sound that cannot be heard reaches even to the Four Seas."* Unless it be the **Dao** manifesting clear virtue, so that all bow in reverence.

In the second year of **Wude** (620), Ji Shanxing and Du Ang rode in chariots to present their tribute, arriving at Chang'an just as the Prefect of **Yuzhou** (郁州) offered a sacred stone tortoise with an inscription reading: *"The realm at peace, ten thousand days."* The **High Ancestor** (高祖) then dispatched his two extraordinary men, conferring upon Ji Shanxing the rank of **Chief Attendant of the Court** (朝散大夫) and sending the **Gentleman-in-Attendance** (舍人) Liu Xian (柳宪) to worship at the shrine.

After the jade and silk offerings were laid out and the proper ritual etiquette observed, the **Divine’s sacred form** appeared at first—radiant and majestic, like a red peak rising over green hills, exhaling the brilliance of spring’s light. When it withdrew, the scene was serene and misty, as if rain had ceased and clouds had vanished, revealing the boundless emptiness of autumn’s sky. No one knew whence it came or whither it went; its emergence was silent and mysterious, its retreat indistinct and wondrous—truly beyond precise description.

The **Dragon Angle Mountain** (龙角山) of **Fenyang** (汾阳) was a hallowed place where Heaven and Earth bestowed blessings. The **High Ancestor** followed the **Dao** of warfare, and upon the mountain’s peak stood the **Hua Pool** (华池), a sacred domain, while below lay the **Stone Cavern** (石穴) and **Tunnel Palace** (洞宫), where the **qi** ascended to **Gushan** (姑射) and gathered the **Dao** of immortals. Its veins connected to **Huo Town** (霍镇), nourishing the abodes of jade and pearls. The **High Ancestor**, seeing the clouds and rain often return, the **congealed qi** (霓倨) and **accumulated blessings** (累装) manifest repeatedly, thus established a shrine at the place where he passed and marked an altar at the site where he received the **Divine’s instruction**. He carved and adorned the **Divine’s sacred image**, painted and embellished its **true attendants** (真卫), so that the **Divine’s light** (神光) flickered and merged within the halls, and the **qi** lingered and swayed, filling the air with the sounds of **ceremonial music** (笙磬) as if traversing celestial paths. He then renamed **Fushan County** (浮山县) as **Shan County** (神山县), commemorating the **Divine’s response** (灵应).

In that year, during the **mid-autumn** (仲秋) and the third month of the **fifth year** (622), **Jinzhou** (晋州) reported that **Laozi** (老君) spoke: *"Within my humble shrine, the withered mulberry revives—my descendants shall reign."* And again: *"My sacred army aids the troops in subduing Liu Heikui (刘黑阖), and by the **establishment of summer** (立夏), peace shall be achieved."* The events unfolded exactly as foretold, all being **prophetic signs** (谶) of what was to come.

Since then, **Taizong** (太宗) during **Zhenyan** (贞观) saw the **clouds of auspiciousness** (祥云) gather at the temple, and **Gaizong** (高宗) during **Chuikong** (垂拱) witnessed the **clouds of reverence** (卿云) surge at the **Divine seat** (神座). Now, within the shrine, the mulberry tree bears clusters of **grape-like fruit** (蒲萄裹), its roots entwined in mystery, while at the gate’s threshold, the **barren wood** (枯枝) flourishes once more. The **luxuriant leaves** (迭黛) and **abundant branches** (丰本) intertwine in verdant splendor, and the **auspicious vapors** (聚祥烟) drift in emerald mists, exuding a **fragrant qi** (佳气) that is thick and vibrant. Layer upon layer, it seems endless—those who discern its meaning take it as a sign that the **Dao of Great Harmony** (太和) has restored its ancient brilliance, and that the **auspicious gathering** (王会) welcomes the **strange and distant** (殊邻).

Fearful of mere **empty responses** (虚应), I was ever vigilant at dusk. I cultivated the **sacred root of the Dao** (灵金根), revered the **mandate of fate** (命璇宸), and earnestly studied **Daoist records** (道记), savoring the **utterances of the profound** (至言). Thus, I adopted the **forms of ritual and music** (礼乐) to embody the **hosted virtue of antiquity** (宿仁义), seeking the **end to glimpse the beginning** (寻末以窥本), clarifying the **hall to attain the essence** (澄厅以诣精). I practiced **non-action within this heart** (无为於此心), and **serving without affairs in the world** (事无事於天下). Consequently, the **ancestral altars** (宗稷) received great blessings, and the **four corners of the land** (寰县) knew minor prosperity. This was the **endless grace** of my **ancestors**, and also the **transformation of the people** in accordance with the **Dao’s natural course** (自然之化).

When the **mysterious form** (幽容) is revealed, it is a **great deed** (伟事); when the **Divine** manifests signs to the **Emperor** (帝符), it is **auspicious omens** (环瑞); when **Ji Shanxing**’s **auspicious deeds** (发祥) are followed, it is a **propitious omen** (吉类); when **auspicious clouds** (祥云) appear in successive reigns, it is a **grand and glorious sign** (鸿懿); when the **sacred army** (神兵) aids the troops and the **barren land** (戎果) flourishes, it is **uniting the strange** (合异); when the **withered trunk** (槁干) revives in lushness, it is **prolific vitality** (蕃炽).

These six phenomena are the **joyous blessings** (嘉祉) of the **ascendant ruler** (兴王) and the **unparalleled records** (绝记) of history.

Though I am unworthy, I have heard the teachings of the **virtuous ones** (君子). Those who follow after them are **heaven’s heirs** (天其祖), and those who practice their instructions are **teachers to the generations** (父其师). I extol the **Dao of the Sage** (榆扬道德), my heart filled with **filial piety and reverence** (孝敬). I compare and praise the **beautiful virtues** of **King Tang** (成汤) and the **revered Dao** of **King Ji** (后稷) from the **Xia and Zhou dynasties** (先王). How could I abandon their **ancient traditions** (旧典)?

As for the **creatures bearing horns** (戴角之类), the **Dragon** is their sovereign, and the **sheep** have a fixed form that does not change. The **Dragon**, however, embodies the **Dao’s transformation** (神化) without limits—it is the **refined essence** of the **Five Earths** (五土). The **state** relies upon the **Earth’s power** (乘土) to reign. Hence, the mountain was renamed **Dragon Angle** (龙角), and its **sacred changes** (灵变) were inscribed upon **gold and stone** (金石).

The inscription reads:

*"In thought of the **sage-like ancestral** (文圣祖), the **profound silence** (玄默) echoes with misty sounds."*

---

**Mysterious and Nameless, Transcending to Supreme Clarity.**
Clarity enters the divine abode, names fade as forms are borrowed.
The body reveres the **Primordial Origin** (玄元), thereafter ruling the world below.
The **High Ancestor** soars with the **Phoenix**, clouds ascending to **Jinyang**.
The **Great Sage** battles as the **Dragon**, winds hastening to **Qin’s plains**.
**Dragon Angle’s Celestial Metropolis**, the **Royal Army** guards the path.
The **Sage’s Form** enters the realm of being, the **Divine Speech** issues from nothingness.
In **Jade Robes and Jade Steeds**, the **Celestial Mandate** is proclaimed.
The **Divine Plan** rests upon us, and mortals awaken to renewal.
Thus, the **Pure Hall** stands, serene and tranquil.
All **Celestial Worthies** pause their journey, and **Auspicious Clouds** arise in celebration.
Mists swirl and gather—**double blessings** for the **Enlightened Sovereign**.
In the courtyard, the **Willow** stands, its distant fruit bearing luster.
At the gate, the **Root** thrives, its **wild branches** ever more luxuriant.
Though **virtue is slight**, we rely upon the **Divine’s favor**.
Recite the **Dao Scriptures**, and my **Divine Hearing** attends.
Inherit the **Five Sages’ Clarity**, govern the **Three Spirits’ affairs**.
Follow the **Precepts of Rectitude**, and **Heaven’s Virtue** brings peace.
The **Great Dao** casts its shadow deep, its boundless compassion embraces all.
How shall one ascend its path? How cross its speech’s ford?
Transformation leaves traces, the **Divine** lacks ostentation.

**In the Seventeenth Year of Kaiyuan (开元), the Year of the Snake (己巳),**
on the **ninth day of the ninth month (九月己丑朔)**, the **third day (三日辛卯)**,

**In the Second Year of Tianxian (先天) of the Great Tang (岁次癸丑),**
on the **seventh month (七月癸亥朔)**, the **fifth day (五日丁卯)**,

**By Imperial Decree**, the **Regulating Daoist Priest Yang Taixi (杨太希)**, entrusted with conveying the **Imperial Robes of the Effortless Sovereign (劫赐玄元皇帝法服)**, arrived at this temple to perform **five days of fasting and ritual (斋醮行道)** before returning. He respectfully crafted a **golden celestial gate (金阙)** for the **Heavenly Worthy (天尊)**, enshrining it as the **Supreme Ancestor (太上皇元始天尊)**. He also enshrined **two True Persons (二真人)** as attendants, and **Golden Immortal and Jade Pure (金仙、玉真)** as **Two Princesses of the Dao (二公主师)**. Their **sacred effigies** shimmered like stars, their **auspicious hues** severe as if welcoming **Purple Gas**. Their craftsmanship rivaled the **Dragon’s proximity**, their artistry exhausted the **Guest’s grace**.

Thus, my **sincere devotion** is laid bare, and this **mysterious aid** sought—
May the **Divine Worthies** descend near, their names exalted among the **Four Great Honors**,
Clutching the **Pact of Purple Heaven**, receiving the **favor of the Three Palaces**,
Through endless **great eons**, all sentient beings,
Forever freed from **emotional bonds**, eternally dwelling in **non-action’s bliss**.

**By Imperial Decree of the Tang Emperor (唐明皇):**

*"Heaven and Earth generate all things through **Great Virtue**,
The Sage governs all things with **Great Treasure**.
Ancient **Mandate-Bearers** were called **Heaven’s Sequence**—
Bright succession is no idle matter.
If the **Dao** lacks reverence, the **Mandate** cannot endure.
The **Emperor** truly rules over you—how then can mortals disregard their sovereign?

For two **decades** since I held the **Mandate**,
Though I have not **drawn the penal cloth** to forbid,
Nor **executed men in the marketplace**,
Yet governance remains **erratic**, customs still **coarse and impure**.
The fault lies in hearts not yet **returned to the Root**.

Who does not cherish **parents and siblings**?
Who does not desire **food, clothing, and warmth**?
Yet they suffer **filial disobedience** and **hunger’s plight**—why?
Because they **know not the Rectitude**, **recognize not the Dao**.
Some cling to **petty wisdom**, scoffing at the **True Way**.
Others seize **small gains**, neglecting **greater good**—
Thus they **fail in the distant**, descending into **violence**.
Their own bodies meet **shame and slaughter**, families **unprotected**.
The **foolish and reckless** often **entrap themselves in litigation**—
Alas! This stems from **teachings left unclear**.

**Punishments** are used only when unavoidable.
All under Heaven are my **children**—
With **sincerity** I admonish, and some may yet **return**.
There is no need for **threats alone**.

First, **governance must prioritize benevolence and forgiveness**—
How could this not **harmonize hearts**?

As for the **Five Constants**, their practice requires no deep insight.
**Six Kinships** in harmony need no **repeated reminders**.
Each should **strive earnestly** to fulfill expectations—
Then **punishments may be set aside**, for the **Dao lies here**.

Now the **auspicious year** arrives, the **Heavenly Breath** begins anew.
Respect **Heaven’s Mandate**, do not defy the **monthly order**.
To all **local officials**, revive the **ancient statutes**:
For all **pregnant creatures**, **insects, and growing things**,
**Harm none**, lest they **perish or wither**.
The **Five Regions** have varied needs—**agriculture depends on timing**.
**Mass labor disrupts seasons**, harming productivity—**strictly forbid this**,
To aid the **Spring’s work**.

As for **families with conscripts**, or **lonely and fierce individuals**,
Or **things turned toward the sun’s warmth**—
These alone **wither in sorrow**—
Truly pitiful! Let officials **attend to their distress**.

**Without benevolence**, one cannot **lead**.
**Without the Dao**, one cannot **act with purpose**.
Thus, the **Dao** is the **gateway to all mysteries**,
While the **heart** is the **master of all affairs**.
Grasp its **essence**, and one may **benefit all**;
Lose its **direction**, and one cannot **preserve oneself**.
Therefore, the **Primordial Emperor** composed the **Five Thousand Characters of the *Dao De Jing***,
Illuminating the **True Principle**, achieving **mystical application**—
Yet those in **high station** have not studied it,
Neglecting **purity and contestation**,
Desiring **refined governance and teaching** to return to **Ancient Simplicity**.

All **ministers and officials** must **carefully read** this,
**Strive sincerely** to advance the **Dao**,
And **reconsider past deliberations**.

As for those who **calculate petty gains**,
**Entangle themselves in trivialities**,
**Pursue fame while acting**,
They **drift further from the Dao**,
**Defying Heaven’s harmony**, **fostering resentment**—
I **deeply detest** such ways.

All must **strive with single-minded devotion**,
Together **promoting the Mysterious Transformation**,
That the **people may ascend to benevolent longevity**,
And the **land return to pristine simplicity**—
This is not distant! **Action alone can achieve it.**

Thus, the **Teachings of Laozi** must be **kept in every household**,
And **encouraged for study**,
So all may **know its essentials.**"

Every year, when selecting officials through the **贡举 (gòngjǔ, imperial examinations)**, let them **equal in measure (等量) the recitation of *The Book of Documents (尚书, Shàngshū)* and *The Debates (论议, Lùnyì)*** with one or two **策 (cè, examination questions)**, and let the **策 (cè)** be **prepared in accordance with the number (准数) and added to the *Laozi (老子, Teachings of Laozi)* examination questions**.

That they may **revere and uphold the Dao’s foundation (道本)**, **and supplement the source of transformation (化源)**.

I **sincerely promote harmony with all**,
And if such teachings of sincerity exist,
They must **verify themselves in action**—
How could mere words suffice?

Now, this **effort (劲)**, too,
Should be **kept in every household (家置)**, each must **repeatedly reflect (三省)**,
To **recognize my intent (识朕怀)**.

On the first day of the first month of the **21st year of Kaiyuan (开元, Kaiyuan) reign**.

The **Tang Emperor (唐明皇, Tang Mínghuáng)** again issued an edict to the **太上老君观 (Tàishàng Lǎojūn Guān, Hall of the Highest Venerable Lord Lao)**:

*"Do not stray from **精 (refined essence)**, do not stray from **真 (authentic reality)**,
Take **Heaven (天)** as your ultimate principle,
And the **Dao (道)** as your gateway.
Manifest in **变化 (transformation)**, thus named **圣人 (sage)**.
My ancestor, the **Highest Venerable Emperor of Mysterious Primordial (太上玄元皇帝, Tàishàng Xuānyuán Huángdì)**,
Once **practiced this Way (从事於斯)**.

When **the vault of Heaven (穹昊, Qiónghuāng)** first emerged,
He **paired with the Divine Illumination (配神明, pèi shénmíng)**,
Feasted on **Heaven and Earth (飨天地, yàn tiāndì)**,
Nurtured **all things (育万物, yù wànwù)**.
When the **Emperor (皇, Huáng)** received his mandate,
He **stood as a model among the ranks (师列壁, shī lièbì)**,
And **radiated with unity (熙以大一, xī yǐ dàyī)**,
Bestowing benefits on **the four seas (四海, Sìhǎi)**,
Yet **not speaking of what he benefited (不言所利)**,
His **virtue and teachings (德教)** extended to **all the people (万姓, wànxìng)**,
Yet **he did not boast of his virtue (不称其德)**,
For he **humbled himself at the edges (将晦边也, jiāng huì biān yě)**.

**Stable in guarding the hidden (安乎守藏)**, **yet ready to act (将行道也)**,
**Adapting to the flowing sands (适乎流沙)**, **placing guests (置宾)**—
Thus, it is shown:
**The Dao has no fixed form (神无方)**, **the Way has no rigid body (道无体)**,
**The boundless (冲)** in use is **visible (用可见)**.

Those who **prolong their course (流长)** must **guard their source (慎其源)**,
Those whose **roots are firm (蒂固)** must **deepen their roots (深其根)**.
**Oh, splendid and wondrous (琦欤那欤)!**
**They opened their path (克开厥后)**, **proliferating our ancestral line (繁我列祖)**,
**Illuminating the great central harmony (光启大中)**—
Could **Mysterious Heaven (玄天)** have **privately favored (私乎)** the **Tang (有唐)**?
Only because **Mysterious Primordial (玄元)** **excelled in planting virtue (迈乎种德)**,
Could **Mysterious Primordial (玄元)** have **received the Tang mandate (式受唐命)**?
Only because **Mysterious Primordial (玄元)** **preserved its essence in humanity (存乎其人)**.

Thus, **successive sages (累圣)** **refined the radiance (缉熙)**,
**Reinvigorated the brilliance (重光钻茂)**,
As **great transformation (大化)** gradually **permeated the eight directions (八表, Bābiǎo)**,
And **pristine virtue (淳德)** abundantly **flowed through all lands (万国, Wàn guó)**,
Then **to Heaven and Earth (天地)** there was **a renewal and establishment (兴立)**.

Yet I, **the humble descendant (小子)**, **excel in past achievements (多于前功)**,
**Day and night, I remain reverently steadfast (夙夜敬止)**,
**Above, I inherit the lingering blessings of ancestors (上承祖宗之余庆)**,
**Below, I embrace the joyous extension of the feudal lords (下膺侯王之乐推)**.
**Awake and vigilant (惕然)**, **I dwell in deep seclusion (深居)**,
**Solemn as if driving a decayed chariot (凛若驭朽)**,
For **the *Dao/Way and Virtue (道德)*** is **the foremost of all schools (百家之首)**,
**The refined source (清摩)** of **all transformations (万化之源)**,
**The essential principle (务本)** for **establishing the ultimate (立极之要)**,
**The Way of Non-Action (无为)** as the **gateway to Great Harmony (太和之门)**.

**Reverently upholding (恭承)** the **transmitted beneficence (垂裕之业)**,
How could I **forget the instruction of nurturing wings (燕翼之训)**?

Thus, I **extend with meticulous care (详延博达)**,
**Discuss and elucidate (讲讽精微)**,
Seeking **what governs the state and the self (理国理身)**,
Thinking **of the highest in conduct and the lowest in imitation (上行下效)**—
This has **been long indeed (久矣)**.

To **make all under Heaven (天下万姓)** **drink of pristine virtue (淳德)**,
And **feed on Great Harmony (太和)**,
That they may **turn their hearts in unison (靡然回心)** and **face the Dao (向道)**—
Could this be **my own meager capacity (予寡薄)**,
Alone **achieving such results (独能致此)**?

Indeed, **all in office (凡百在位)**,
So that **all may flourish harmoniously (咸熙)**,
*The Book of Documents* says:
**"The sovereign’s virtue is serene and vast! Oh, the limbs and sinews are strong and upright!" (元首康哉，股肱良哉。)**
It also says:
**"The limbs and sinews are indeed the people; the virtuous ministers are indeed the sages." (股肱惟人，良臣惟圣。)**
This is **one virtue shared in governance (一德而共理)**—
How could it **come to this (至於今)** of **disharmony and confusion (跟整)**?

In the past, **those with long reins and purple robes (长缨紫衣)**,
Still **heard of admiration and emulation (犹闻慕向)**,
And **even broad-browed, high-haired figures (广眉高髻)**,
Spoke of **changing customs (变俗)**—
How could it be that **the Dao is now so difficult to clarify (道之难明)**,
And **the Mysterious Pearl (玄珠, the Dao’s essence)** is **so long lost (久丧)**?

The ancients said:
**"The sovereign’s relation to the realm is like that of a single hall’s occupants." (王者之於天下，犹一堂之上也。)**
Meaning **united in heart and virtue (同心同德)**,
Their **transformations spread to the four quarters (化流四裔)**.
This is truly **the power of sincerity (诚)**—
Whether in **the moment of awakening from confusion (击豕垂踵之惑)**,
Or **the sorrow of turning one’s face toward the Dao (革面向隅之哀)**,
Thus, in **former years (往年)**, I **issued decrees (布令)**,
That **every family should keep the *Dao/Way and Virtue (道德)***,
Hoping that **virtue would stand firm (德立)** and **winds would spread (风靡)**,
And **the Dao would be preserved (道存)** in **daily practice (日用)**,
Then **my ancestral legacy (陈祖业)** would **become the common heritage (尚家书)**,
And **all would follow the Way (出门同人)**—
Without **contradiction in the world (无魄於天下)**.

*The Book of Changes* says:
**"The *xiàng (象, images/symbols)* are indeed **representations of this (像此者也)**."*
*The Classic (经)* says:
**"In the **profound and obscure (窈冥)** there exists **精 (refined essence)**,
Then the **精 (refined essence)** of the **profound and obscure (窈冥)**,
Can be **sought through symbols (寻象求)**,
Yet **cannot be obtained by mere naming and speech (不可以名言得)**."*
Thus, **examining diagrams and histories (考图史)**,
For **every sage and ancestor (凡圣祖)** in their **descents and dwellings (降代出处)**,
I **dare to establish images (敢立像)** to **fully express their intent (尽其意)**.

To **manifest from the family (自家)** to **shape the state (形国)**,
From **the inner (中)** to **the outer (外)**—
Thus, **perhaps those who understand the Dao (知道者)** will **fill their measures (盈量)** and **return (归)**,
And **those lost in confusion (迷方者)** will **not stray far (不远)** before **they awaken (而复)**."

**True Pearl Cave**

In the twenty-seventh year of *Kaiyuan* (开元), the year *Jisi* (己卯), on the first day of the first month (*Jiawu*朔), the fifteenth day (*Wushen*戊申):

The **True Pearl Cave**—as recorded in the *Illustrated Gazetteer (图经)*—lies on the southern slope of the *Longjiao Mountain’s* (龙角山) bound peak, where a cave eight *chi* wide and forty-eight *chi* deep yawns inward, its depths broadening beyond measure. Pearls often emerge from its mouth, hence its name. During the *Xiantian* (先天) and *Dali* (大历) eras, sacrifices were once held to summon the **Sovereign of the Dark Primordium (玄元皇帝)**, and a *Dragon Mirror (龙璧)* was cast into the cave. In the *Tianyou* (天佑) year of the Jin dynasty, an envoy dispatched to *Silla* (新罗) reported that upon arriving in that land, he saw the two treasures floating upon the water. Upon his return to *Chang’an*, he submitted a memorial offering them to the throne.

Even now, within the cave, the sounds of *sheng* pipes, *xiao* flutes, *guan* reeds, and *qing* stone chimes may be heard.

**Preface to the Golden Refining Hall of *Regong* Temple (庆唐观金练斋颂)**
Composed by **Cui Mingguang (崔明光)**, *Zuo Shiyi* (左拾遗) and *Inner Attendant (内供奉)*, of *Boling* (博陵)

Within the **void’s embrace**, at the **crossing of the unseen**—
The **numinous scriptures** shine forth, **mystically fused** with the **Primordial Oneness**.

What is this **Primordial Oneness**? The **Form before the Emperor**—
What are these **numinous scriptures**? The **Dragon-Han epoch’s** decree.

Five *kalpas* cycle in their course, as **divine sovereignty** shifts in succession,
Nine **Black Ones** align in order, the **Primordial Origin** self-so.

Cold as the **Hall of the Flowing Star**,
Refined in the **Abode of Bright Clarity**—
The **Two Compendia** draw from it to fix their stations,
The **Three Luminaries** kindle from it to radiate their light.
**Red Clarity** unfurls its diagram,
**Azure Void** extends its universal salvation.
The **Sovereign of the Dark Primordium** reigns supreme,
Yet the **Great Dao** grows desolate.

The **True Ancestor** follows its law with **non-action**,
The **Naihuang Emperor** gazes upward but fails to grasp it.
The **Sacrificial Oxen** respond to the *mandate*,
As **Yao and Shun** ride the age’s tide—
All strive for **perfect transformation**, seeking harmony,
Sipping the **mystic winds** yet nearly faltering.
Standing alone through the ages, they **abide like the deep**,
First among kings, their **vastness unbound**.

If the **Ancestral Sage** descends from **divine lineage**,
And the **Godly Lineage** inherits the **Sacred Pattern**—
*Xiantian* does not defy, *Houjian* follows in succession,
Bestowing **blessings upon descendants**, extending the **source’s flow**,
The **State’s foundation** is fortified, the **martial clans** submit,
Revering the **ancestral deeds**, the **Three Harmonies** align with **One Virtue**,
The **Six Leaves** walk the **Same Dao**.

The **Playang Palace of the Dark Primordium**—
Its inception marks the **king’s auspicious omen**.
At its first commission, **auspicious signs** were recorded,
Its **sacred precincts** aligned with **virtuous omens**,
Illuminated in the **national annals**, now in this **era of peace**,
It pairs with the **eternal blessings of Yongjia**,
Its **pure temple** is restored, its **grand halls** rebuilt—
Inscribed upon the **imperial stele**, it stands as the **Dao’s model for the world**,
This **land as the world’s exemplar**.
Who but the **Most Sage** could have foreseen this?

The **Emperor**, in his **non-action**, governs with **effortless clarity**,
His **mind purified**, his **will unified**—
In dreams, he **beholds the divine**, his **hair and beard** take **true form**,
Honoring the **filial piety of his ancestors**, inheriting the **mystic teachings**,
In *Kaiyuan*, the **sacred image** is obtained,
In *Tianbao*, the **divine talisman** is secured—
**Grand blessings** gather anew, **prosperity flourishes**,
The **supreme teachings** rise complete.
The **sacred rites and proclamations** reach their height,
No second can compare—
The **Auspicious Dragon** shines in the **sacred effigy**,
The **Wronged Phoenix** is posthumously enshrined as **Emperor**.
Though **Nata’s hymns** and **Zhou’s elegies** may praise,
They pale beside the **glory of today**.

Upon this **mountain’s summit**, where the **divine resides**,
Facing **Gushan** to the west, bordering **Tianzhu** to the north—
A **treasure-house of immortals**, where the **Celestial Way** is kept.

The **main hall** stands in **awe-inspiring solemnity**,
The **vast courtyard** looms in **dense stillness**,
Peaks and pines encircle, their **shadows intertwined**—
All is **emptiness**, **depth**, and **tranquility**.

The **stone altar**, tiered and grand,
Echoes with **chanting and incantations**,
Hidden **precepts** of the **Three Five**,
**Sacred texts** guarding the **cavern’s depths**—
The **Three Celestial Cycles** mark the **lunar phases**,
On the **eighth month’s birth**, the **law is displayed here**,
The **Golden Register** is observed in fasting,
The **Jade Emperor’s Seal** is unveiled—
The **treasures of the Dao**, the **ceremonies of kings**,
None surpass this splendor.

Then the **Gate of Heaven** is opened,
The **Door of Earth** is unveiled—
**Qi** is drawn from the **boundless void**,
The **wind harmonizes with the *Buzhou* winds**,
And the **Eight Trigrams** move within.

Gazing upward at the **aligned stars**,
Treading the **Great Bear’s path**,
As the **setting sun sinks into shadow**,
At dusk, the **mists rise thick**—
The **Six Jia** assist at its side.

The **immortals lead the procession**, the **feathered sages** walk the **void**,
Paying homage to the **Nine Heavens**, sacrificing to the **Five Elders**—
When **Gouchen** is invoked, **yellow clouds descend**,
When **Taiyi** is summoned, **white cranes take flight**,
And the **fragrant youths of jade**, the **speaking maidens of jade**,
Waft through **misty visions**, lingering in the **Primordial Space**—
Seeking them is **rare and subtle**, yet **as if in perfect accord**.

Thus, the **Celestial Pole is steadied**,
At this **auspicious hour**—
Externally, it **clears the ten thousand *li***,
As **barbarians and tribes** turn to **civilization**,
Internally, it **secures the myriad peoples**,
Ensuring **abundant harvests**, **plentiful grain**,
**Extinguishing calamities**, **nurturing prosperity**,
All things **thrive and grow**—
When **yang qi** flourishes, **arms fall silent**,
When the **Spirit Officials** descend, **diseases vanish**,
The **earthworms** sense the **upper realms**,
The **gods bestow blessings**,
The **august mandate** arrives—
**May the Son of Heaven reign ten thousand years!**

The **Abbot Guo Chujì (郭处寂)**, devout and diligent,
Day and night without respite,
Holding the **master’s records**, bearing the **mountain’s talisman**,
Personally performing the **ritual protocols**,
Planning the **legal precepts**—

In the **sixteenth year of *Kaiyuan*** (开元十六载),
The **imperial inscription** was bestowed upon the temple,
And thus it was **officially recorded**.

In the **twenty-fifth year** (二十五年),
He petitioned for the **fasting rites**,
The Emperor **approved his request**,
And so **high-ranking immortals** arrived from the **capital city**,
Carrying **imperial decrees** from the **Heavenly Court**,
While **nobles and officials** gathered in solemn attendance,
And **counties and towns** celebrated with **festive rituals**—
The **old walls** were torn down, the **new halls** constructed,
The **sacred images** anew, their **crimson hues** vivid,
Their **golden luster** radiant—
All that was **planned is now complete**,
A **blessing for eternal rectitude**.

The **Prefect Pei Yao (裴眺)** and his **subordinates**,
With **sincere reverence for the Dao**,
Their **loyalty manifest in governance**,
Offered **sacrifices for rest and blessing**,
And the **monks of *Gaohua Temple*** all joined in **harmony**,
Thus aligning with the **Natural Extremes**.

In the **reign of *Xianhe*** (熙和),
They **abided in serene simplicity**,
In the **era of *Dashun*** (大顺),
They **rested in tranquil joy**.

This humble servant once served in *Fenyang*,
And **witnessed the sacred traces** with my own eyes—
Though I **dare not name the Dao’s origin**,
I **record the True Ruler’s**—
How the **mysterious sovereign** discerns the **unseen**,
And through **symbols without form**, attains **true knowledge**.

Thus, the **verse** proclaims:
*"The Three Black Ones’ lineage—*
*From the **Primordial Dark Origin**!*
*Juzu’s **Red Clarity**, the **Dragon-Han epoch’s mark**—*
*This is the **True Record’s** decree."*

The **Highest Dao Sovereign** entrusted his birth to the **Hong Clan**,
And **post-Heaven** aligned with **virtue/power**, its sole embodiment being **my Li**.

From this beginning, the **auspicious course** commenced,
And the **sacred mandate** returned to the **Tang**.

In **Haixian County**, his lineage flourished,
Six generations now radiant once more.

In the **era of *Tianbao*** (天宝),
He **received the sacred charge**,
And the **Ten Thousand Ages** know no bounds.

The **True Ruler** extended his decree,
Surveying the **Primordial Yang**’s chronicles.

Within the **Void-Emptiness**,
A **Natural Mystery** manifests its wonders.
Among the **nameless multitude**,
The **Vital Radiance** bursts forth from the **Pearl Mouth**.

One cannot **welcome** what is unseen before,
Nor **follow** what is unseen behind.
Though **external things** may change,
The **Dao’s eternal law** endures.

The **Dragon’s Horn** stands majestic,
Marking the **origin of sacred traces**.

The **Celestial Palace** was established,
And **Pure Clarity’s Domain** became his abode.
The **Heavenly Enclosure** stretches boundless,
The **Earthly Circumference** lies distant.

**Great is the Dao!** It descends with **radiant authority**,
And its **mighty presence** shines upon the world below.

The **Golden Register** conceals its **hidden principles**,
The **Jade Capital** holds its **mysterious utterances**.
The **Ascension Platform’s** rites,
Are the **gateway to all methods**.

The **Holy Ancestor** left his **precepts**,
To **forever instruct** his **pious descendants**.

Now, **this sacred mandate** is conferred,
To **eternally safeguard** the **Primordial Root**.

His **posterity shall prosper**,
And **great blessings** shall ever remain.

This **inscribed stone of joy** is carved,
To **honor the Most Venerable**.

In the **second year of *Tianbao*** (天宝), **year of *Guiwei*** (癸未),
On the **first day of the tenth month** (十月丙寅朔),
The **fifteenth day** (十五日), **Gengchen** (庚辰), **Lower Void Fast** was erected.

**Recorded as an auspicious omen**.

「In the third year of His Majesty’s reign under Heaven, on the eighteenth day of the third month, the **Pious and Pure** (沐虔洁) **Li** (李) **Huán** (寰) **Zhāi** (斋), **Supreme Commander of the Regional Pacification Forces** (都团练、观察处置使) and **Exalted Left Scattered Gentleman** (检校左散骑常侍), concurrently holding the office of **Grand Censor** (御史大夫) and bestowed with the **Golden Fish Pouch** (紫金鱼袋), performed rites of purification at **God Mountain’s** (神山) **Celebrating Tang Temple** (庆唐观), honoring the **Holy Ancestor, Primordial Emperor** (圣祖玄元皇帝). Upon completion of the rites, he paid respects to the **True Temples** (真庙) of the **Six Sages** (六圣): **High Ancestor** (高祖), **Emperor Taizong** (太宗), **Emperor Gaozong** (高宗), **Emperor Ruizong** (睿宗), **Emperor Zhongzong** (中宗), and **Emperor Xuanzong** (玄宗). The **divine response** (灵感) shone forth, and **auspicious radiance** (休光) stirred the heavens.

Then he ascended to **Dragon’s Horn** (龙角), **Hua Pool** (华池), and **Lü Forest Peak** (陆林岭). Gazing upon **Emerald Mists** (翠微), he beheld the **auspicious banyan’s** (瑞梧) wondrous form, tracing the **Bo’s vine** (循葛) as it sprawled and intertwined, with **Dragon and Phoenix** (龙凤) motifs interwoven, descending upon the temple courtyard. New branches sprouted, bearing witness to the **Sage’s blessings** (圣祚) for **millions of years** (百万年).

His Majesty’s **mystic intent** (上玄之意) was to ensure this tree flourish **tall and steadfast** (茂耸贞固), standing **boundless and eternal** (无疆). Indeed, in the **third month of the fourteenth year of *Dàlì*** (大历十四年), a single branch had already emerged, its details meticulously recorded in **maps and annals** (图牒). This year, in the same month, another branch grew, confirming that **auspicious cycles** (历数昌期) stretch **far beyond reckoning** (邈不可算). The **imperial symbols** (帝王符契) align with **mystic scriptures** (玄经), as they ought.

Though unworthy, I was honored to be **counted among the descendants of the Sage** (宗枝), entrusted with **inspection and supervision** (廉察). Hearing of this **sacred omen** (灵迩), my heart could not rest in peace. Thus, I selected an **auspicious day** (吉日) and, with reverent prayer (礼祈), obtained the **venerable image** (尊像). Together with **Brilliant Harmony** (再和) **Wu** (吴), **Supreme Commander of the Left Divine Strategy Army** (左神策军监) and **Iron Forge Overseer** (铁冶使), **Commander Zhang** (张令绾), **Counselor of State** (朝议郎), **Chief of the Inner Attendants Office’s Imperial Registry Bureau** (行内侍省内府局丞), **Assistant Official** (员外置), and **Exalted Upright Officer** (上柱国), all bestowed with the **Golden Fish Pouch** (诽鱼袋), we examined the **height of the planted tree** (所植柄树), measured the **length of the Bo’s vine** (葛蔓尺寸), and commissioned artisans to **illustrate its form** (图画其形状). The findings were **fully reported** (具表) to the throne, and thus this **inscribed stone** (碑阴) was carved, to **transmit its glory undying** (传不朽).

**Inscription and Preface for the Temple of Celebrating Tang**

Composed by **Chancellor of God Mountain County** (知神山县事) **Kǎn Wàng** (韩望), **Junior Official of the Way** (将仕郎).

The **Dao** (道) **nourishes all things** (母万物), and things, like children, arise from it. Its **form was established at the dawn of creation** (象成太初), **embracing the Primordial *Qi*** (囊括元气). It **dispersed the misty vapors** (抉散氤氲), existing **before Heaven and Earth** (先天地有). It **inherited the pure and unadulterated** (禀立纯粹) and **preserved the Great Harmony** (保合大和), thus Heaven became **clear**, Earth **tranquil**, the **divine spirit** (神) **responsive**, the **grain abundant**, and **kings and lords** (王侯) **rulers of the world below**.

Should the **True Dao** (正道) be **obscured and neglected** (湮郁), then its **forms would have no origin** (象无所出). Thus, the heavens would **not hang the sun and moon**, the earth would **not open its mountains and rivers**, the **divine essence** (神素) would **remain concealed and veiled** (阴隐), and mankind would **suffocate in their nature** (窒性情).

Therefore, it **penetrates all without obstruction**, **encompasses the dual principles** (两仪) yet **reveals no trace of its workings** (不见其实). It **receives the minutest particles** (纳毫末) yet **shows no limit to its embrace** (不睹其隘). It **cannot be measured by the eye** (不可以眸砚), nor **grasped by the mind** (不可以智运).

Its **form is without substance** (象无体), yet it is the **form of all things** (万物之象). Its **substance is without name** (体也无称), yet it is the **name of all things** (万物之名其称也). It **cannot be called "having"** (不可谓之有), for it is the **instrument of all things’ form** (谓之有形其器也). It **cannot be called "not having"** (不可谓之无), for it is the **transformation of all things’ extinction** (谓之无灭其变也). **Having arises from the non-having** (有生於无), and **the non-having takes root in the having** (无根於有). **Having and non-having are one thread** (有无一贯), **existing in all things** (存於万物). Only then does one **perceive the marvel of the Dao** (见道之妙) and the **beginning of all things** (物之始).

Thus it is said:
*"In the having, all things coalesce,
Before Heaven and Earth they arise.
Silent and boundless, they stand alone,
Unchanging, yet ever revolving."*

By this, one may **infer the pattern** (稽), and know that **mankind follows Earth** (人法地), **Earth follows Heaven** (地法天), **Heaven follows the Dao** (天法道), **and the Dao follows the Natural Way** (道法自然). Among these, the **Greatest in the realm** (域中之大者) is the Dao, which **stands at the pinnacle** (冠首焉).

**Laozi** (老子) **served under the Ji Dynasty** (仕於姬周), and his **descendants endured through the Han and Wei** (子孙延於汉魏). **Confucius** (仲尼) **beheld him and sighed**, calling him *"a dragon still hidden"* (见而叹其犹龙). **Zilu** (子路) and **Zigong** (子长) **were his secluded disciples** (为隐君子), and his **deeds and traces** (事迹) **shone with clarity** (蔼然), **fully recorded in the annals and histories** (备载经史).

When **Mount Tai’s grandeur declined** (洎泰山其颓), the **teachings of rites and music** (礼乐之言) **fell into ruin** (圯). The **Blue Ox** (青牛) **announced its departure** (告逝), and **discourses on Dao and Virtue** (道德之论) **became stranded** (屿). Thereafter, **waves of doctrine spread like trailing vines** (波引蔓延), **scattered yet never gathering** (散而不聚). Thus, **ink was discarded, paths blocked** (扬墨塞路), **renunciation of benevolence and righteousness** (背仁义之说) flourished, while **Zhuangzi and Liezi’s teachings** (庄列) **stood as mere paradoxes** (立寓言之理). Yet they **failed to grasp** (殊不知) that **Confucius and Laozi**, **carving the hidden principles of the Six Classics** (刊六经之秘旨) and **unfolding the profound essence of the Five Thousand Words** (阅五千之纯奥), **set the standard for the world** (与世作程) and **encompassed Heaven and Earth** (范围天地).

Why? Because the **Six Classics’ principles** (六经之旨) are **correct and exhaustive** (正而详), while the **Dao and Virtue’s profundities** (道德之奥) are **harmonious and complete** (和而备). **Correctness** (正) brings **filial piety between parents and children** (父子亲), **stability in ruler-subject relations** (君臣定), **clarity in rites and music** (礼乐昭), and **balance in punishments and rewards** (刑赏中). **Harmony** (和) fosters **a vacant heart** (心以虚), **a serene spirit** (神以清), **the expulsion of evil** (恶以恢), and **the establishment of goodness** (善以立). Thus, **foundations of state and cultivation of people** (基国树民) are achieved, **the pure is embraced and the false discarded** (包淳剔伪), **the Sovereign’s ultimate measure is set** (建皇极), and **the realm of longevity is ascended** (跻寿域). **No scholar has ever abandoned the Dao** (未有遗儒捐道) and **yet attained its truth** (而后臻其理者).

As **later ages grew more corrupt** (后世益腌), the **ancient sages grew more distant** (前圣逾远), and **none could fully expound their teachings** (不能宏启其教). Only **their scattered ripples endured** (但浩扬厥波), so **mystic emptiness** (玄虚) was **revered**, **transcendence** (羽化) **pursued**, and **tall, broad hats** (峨冠) **worn**. The **eyes were called "Daoists"** (目为道士), and though **disciples multiplied** (得徒既繁), grand temples were **erected in splendor** (大壮观庙), **clay statues formed** (垩泥致像), and **cinnabar used to paint their likenesses** (研丹写形), **competing with the Buddhist sect** (与浮屠氏并驱). **Lush forests of doctrine** (滔源茂林) **flourished across China** (盛於中国), and their **origin is ancient** (其来尚矣).

In the past, the **Sui Dynasty** (隋) **obtained the Sacred Mandate** (获神器), yet **Emperor Yang** (炀) **did not secure its foundation** (不固基). He **raided Liao and ventured to the Huai River** (征辽幸淮), **following human desires** (以人从欲), leaving the **vast lands of the Nine Regions** (茫茫九土) where the people **barely survived** (民不聊生). Their **grievances penetrated to the marrow** (怨入骨髓), and **rebellion arose across the land** (天下兴叛).

The **Tang House** (唐公) **rescued the weary** (拯疲), and **the righteous call was raised** (参墟启号). **Voices of justice resounded** (义声高唱), **echoing through the Four Seas** (响振四海). Though **the mandate struck the people’s hearts** (契人心), the **bandits still obstructed** (众盗犹梗), and the **quest for sovereignty remained uncertain** (逐鹿之功未知谁手).

At that time, in the **third year of *Wǔdé*** (武德三祀), **Jin’s** (晋人) **Ji Shàn** (吉善) **encountered a white-clad old man** (行於羊角山见白衣老父) on **Sheep’s Horn Mountain** (羊角山), whose **beard and mustache were snowy white** (须鬓皓然), **riding a white horse with a red mane** (乘白马朱鬣), **of majestic bearing** (仪容甚伟). Two **green-clad youthful attendants** (青衣童子) accompanied him. The old man spoke to Ji Shàn, saying:
*"Tell the **Tang Emperor** (唐国天子) that I am **Laozi** (老君), your **Holy Ancestor** (即汝祖也). After the **rebellious forces are pacified** (平贼), you shall **become Emperor** (为帝). The **world shall know great peace** (天下太平), and your **reign shall endure long** (享国长久)."*

**Emperor Taizong** (太宗) **sent the Envoy Du’áng** (杜昂) to offer sacrifices. Soon after, the **divine spirit appeared again** (神复见), and spoke to Du’áng:
*"Return to the Emperor and tell him: I neither **drink nor eat** (不饮食), so why **trouble him with sacrifices** (何烦於祭)."*
Suddenly, the **divine spirit vanished** (忽然不见), and the Emperor **marveled at this** (上异之). He **erected a temple there** (立庙於其地), and the **county name was changed from *Fúshān Yángjiǎo*** (浮山羊角) to its **present name** (今名).

When the **Qianfeng era** (乾封元年) began, the **Emperor Taizong** was posthumously enshrined as the **Supreme High Emperor of Primordial Mystery** (太上玄元皇帝). Thereafter, as the **Earthly Branch’s virtue declined**, the **Wood Branch ascended to the Southern Dipper**, and the **Jin Dynasty** (朱梁) consolidated power, abdicating the **Tang imperial throne** (禅唐寰鼎) through regicide and usurpation, its **heavenly mandate did not endure**. When the **Zhuang Emperor** (庄皇) reunified the realm, he restored the **Tang’s former glory**, thus the **Tang officials** (亳官) once again flourished, and the **auspicious omens of the Tang’s sacred spirit** (唐灵) extended their splendor. These **divine responses across the ages** are fully recorded in the **state histories**.

After the **Later Jin** (石晋) and **Later Han** (刘汉), warlords vied for dominion, leaving no respite for governance. This **sanctuary**, though remote in its mountain fastness and situated in the **southern reaches of Jin**, lacked official resources and labor. Its **ancient foundations crumbled**, and its **structures eroded into ruins**. Earlier, the **Li Tang** (李唐) from **Emperor Shengao** (神尧) to **Emperor Xuanzong** (玄宗) had painted the **six ancient emperors’ likenesses** and enshrined the **three sovereigns** (三皇) in the **main hall**, yet over time, the **colors faded**, and though **disciples gathered daily**, the **glory never revived**. Though the **former traces remained**, the **later ones failed to follow**.

The **Superintendent of the Observatory**, Daoist **Liang Zhizhen** (梁志真), transcended vulgar customs, illuminated the **Great Vision** (大观), renounced worldly desires, and sought the **mysterious and rare**. He believed that **to rectify the end, one must first establish the foundation**, and that **to follow a master, one must first venerate his teaching**. Since later generations could not **embody the Dao and act accordingly**, yet all **gazed upon the images and emulated them**, if this **sanctuary fell into disrepair**, how could it **inspire faith among the people of the four quarters** or **stir the winds of transcendent virtue**?

In the **first year of Jingde** (景德元年), he **set out for the capital**, presented a memorial at the **imperial court**, detailing the **Tang’s origins** and the **auspicious signs of Primordial Mystery**, declaring that **reviving the ancient and honoring the sacred** must await a **sage-ruler’s reign**. The **Sovereign**, embodying the **Great Symbol**, governed with **rectitude and harmony**, sought **Daoist counsel from Kongtong Mountain** (崆峒) and **divine guidance from Gushan** (姑射), rejecting **superficial rewards** and **petty pleasures** to govern with **the people’s welfare as his own**. In this **age of great harmony**, he **promoted the cultivation of non-action**, and thus **approved the memorial**, issuing an imperial edict to **Jin Prefecture** to **restore the ancient halls** and **honor their sanctity**.

Though the **workmen assembled**, the **structures remained unfinished**, when in the **twenty-fifth day of the second month of the second year**, mist and clouds swirled, filling the air with **auspicious qi**. The **silent mountains seemed to receive a descent**. Suddenly, the **morning light cleared**, the **heavens opened wide**, and upon the **altar platform**, a **forest of ancient forms** stood resplendent—**sixteen trees** with **fragrant branches and lush leaves**, their **crystals and blossoms glistening with dew**, sweet as **honeyed syrup**. This **miracle was not confined to the Three Sovereigns’ peaks**, nor did the **sun’s rays dare to dry them**; all present **witnessed it with awe**.

Thus, the **local magistrate was summoned**, who reported to the **prefect**, who in turn **ordered officials to verify the truth**. From **beginning to end**, the **signs endured for eight days** before dispersing. The **prefecture recorded the vision**, submitted a **detailed account**, and sent the **illustrations to court**.

I have often heard that **the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao**, and the **name that can be named is not the eternal name**. The **nameless is the origin of heaven and earth**; the **named is the mother of ten thousand things**. Thus it is said: **There is the Great Ease (太易)**, the **Great Beginning (太初)**, the **Great Commencement (太始)**, and the **Great Primordial (太素)**.

The **Great Ease** is **before qi manifests**; the **Great Beginning** is **the origin of qi**; the **Great Commencement** is **the origin of form**; the **Great Primordial** is **the origin of substance**.

**Laozi** originally spoke of **substance to illustrate the Dao**, exhausting its depths. He **observed its mysteries without desire**, and **penetrated its subtleties with desire**, thus **communing with the unseen and fathoming the profound**. His **intent transcended mere traces**, his **spirit transformed without constraint**.

Earlier, he **foretold the Tang’s great peace**; now, he **descends upon the Song with sweet dew**. If not for the **proper time** and a **sage-ruler**, who could **harmonize such responses as these**?

In the **second year**, having **ascended to the highest rank in the imperial examinations**, I **began my official career** by being appointed **magistrate of this district**. Following the **prefect’s orders** and **imperial decree**, I **supervised the artisans and the people** to restore the **three halls**: the **Hall of Primordial Mystery (玄元)**, the **Hall of the Three Pure Ones (三清)**, and the **Hall of the Three Sovereigns (三皇)**.

Though the **work was completed**, I did not yet record these events. In the **first year of Xianfu** (大中祥符元年), the **county’s administrative rank was abolished**, and I was **summoned to the Selection Bureau**. Liang Zhizhen **polished the stele** and placed it in the **sanctuary**, requesting an inscription. Though I **declined firmly**, I **simply recounted the circumstances** and composed this **inscription**:

*"The Dao is truly strong, its name precedes heaven and earth.
Formless, it loses no trace—silent, yet never without sound."*

The Dao is neither bright nor dim—only subtle and refined.
Who traces its profound intent? The *Zhou* historian’s pillar stands firm.
Before the Emperor’s form, the *Gushen* [谷神] lives undying.
Empty yet applied, it takes and discards.
The *Sui* declined, the *Tang* flourished—suddenly, the Sage shone forth.
Without leaving *Hangu Pass*, he declared his mandate received.
Divining longevity, his descendants rejoiced.
The *Tianshi* [天师] shrine stood solemn, yet the *Tang* sacrifices grew distant.
Virtue and Way were silent; pines and willows rustled alone.
Who would tend them now? It fell to this sacred reign.
This sage emperor, wise and enlightened, embodied the Dao and thrived.
He restored the ruined halls, and the *Xuanjiao* [玄教] shone anew.
How did he manifest his response? The auspicious dew filled the *letong* [瓖].

His disciple, *Zhizhen*, devoted and diligent,
Aspired to the *Dantai* [丹台], his name inscribed in purple.
Daily he tended them—never neglecting future generations.

**Record of the Restoration of the Three Pure Ones Hall**
The *Tiansheng Guan* [天圣观] is where the *Tang* Sage-Emperor descended in truth. Its terrain is grand and imposing, surpassing all within the *Hebu* [河束].
Within, the three halls rise tiered and successive: one to *Laozi*, one to the *Three Pure Ones*, one to the *Three Sovereigns*, with the Six Emperors attending.
From *Tang* to *Song*, years passed, and time eroded them—wind and rain decayed the beams, the eaves collapsed, and the colors faded. The halls stood neglected and unkempt.
The walls crumbled, gaping open, weeds choked the courtyard, and cattle grazed beside them. The rites were slack, the offerings unworthy.
The yellow-capped priests scattered, their customs and diets diverging, harming the teaching.
Though their lands were ample, their taxes light, the abuses festered.

The county magistrate, *Gongsun Gong*, upon offering sacrifices beneath the *ke* tree, lamented their ruin. Resolved, he ordered the artisans to restore the decay, abolish the abuses, and renew all things.
The beams now rise proud, the pillars gleam with vermilion and green—what was once neglected is now resplendent.
Enclosed by walls and moats, the filth was cleared—what was once unkempt is now solemn and pure.
The priests’ halls and kitchens were unified in their meals, and the *Dadao Tang* [道堂] gathered them in one dwelling—those who harmed the teaching were gone.
The annual levies were increased, the profits multiplied—longstanding abuses were erased.

Thus the Daoists said among themselves: *"Gongsun Gong is truly virtuous! He renewed our halls, unified our order, benefited our people, and upheld our teaching. Now travelers bow in reverence, and those who enter do so with solemnity, awakening sincere devotion from all quarters. His deeds in reviving our Way—though it had declined—are not slight! He who sustains the Dao, restoring it from decay, began with him. This accomplishment must be recorded."* They urged me to inscribe it.

**Record of the Restoration of the *Jiarun Hou* Hall**
Composed on the *waning day* of the sixth month, *Zhenghe* Year 1.

**Record of the Restoration of the Hua Chi Jia Run Hou Hall**
Composed by *Jinshi* Wang Jianzhong

It is said that in recent times, the divine title has been repeatedly altered, and the deity has been successively ennobled as a *Hou* [侯]. First, it was named *Hua Chi* [華池], then *Xianshi* [顯施], and finally *Jia Run* [嘉润], though all three share the same origin beneath different names.

Now, the divine presence resides where the *qi* of the sacred gathers—towering upon the mountain’s peak, with a spring welling from the depths of the pool, where clouds and dragons conceal themselves within. When the peaks tremble and clash, their resonance gives rise to the omen of sacred waters emerging. In years of drought, all who pray to this water, with sincere devotion, find it sweet and abundant, never failing to quench their thirst. Thus, those far and near who benefit from its blessings are not confined to one region alone.

Upon observing that the hall’s foundations were cramped and its halls in ruin, who would dare to neglect its restoration? Then, Li Yin of Nan Li Village and Chen Sigung of Shang Dong Village, moved by pious resolve, took the lead. They declared, *"The pool presses against the hall’s steps, so we shall relocate the divine seat by several *zhang* [丈], erect a fragrant pavilion at the front, and lay new foundations at the rear."* They gathered laborers and materials, and with swift craftsmanship, the work was completed in no time.

On the *zhongyuan* [中元] festival of that very year, at dawn, they finished the hall and announced its completion. They then invited the Daoist assembly, set up solemn incense offerings, and summoned those who had contributed to the effort, celebrating together. On that day, I also went to observe, and at their request, I composed this record—truly a worthy deed—to be inscribed on jade and stone, enduring through the ages.

Composed on the *zhongyuan* day of the *Tian Hui* [天會] Eleventh Year.

**Record of the Restoration of the Hua Chi Jia Run Hou Hall**
Composed by *Xiangong Jinshi* Tian Wei

From antiquity to the present, sacred peaks and grottoes, divine manifestations of Heaven and Earth, and the traces of saints and spirits—whether their wonders appear in the world or their virtues benefit the people—are all recorded in the sacrificial canons, worshipped in their due seasons, to honor the divine.

Now, within our county, thirty *li* to the south stands Long Jiao Mountain [龍角山], formerly known as Yang Jiao Mountain [羊角山], renamed during the Tang. The mountain has two peaks: the eastern, *Hua Chi* [華池], and the western, *Jiang Jun* [將軍]. As recorded in the gazetteers, their names are ancient, passed down through tradition, their origins unknown.

The divine wonders and virtues of this mountain are beyond description. In the early years of the Tang’s *Wu De* [武德] era, the *Tai Shang* [太上] manifested before the sweet osmanthus tree at Long Jiao Mountain, where it encountered a virtuous man from Quwu named Ji Shanxing. The deity ordered him to report to the Tang emperor. Shanxing then presented himself at court, recounting the event, and the divine Emperor Gaozu rejoiced greatly. He thus established an observatory at the mountain’s foot, naming it *Qing Tang Guan* [慶唐觀].

At that time, Emperor Taizong led his armies in Yan, and sent Du Ang to offer sacrifices at the site of the manifestation. The *Tai Shang* appeared again, saying to Ang, *"I neither drink nor eat—what need have I of sacrifices?"* The locals then believed that the place where the *Tai Shang* manifested was surely a *Dongtian Fudi* [洞天福地], and thus revered the deity all the more.

The eastern peak, called *Hua Chi*, has a pool upon it—deep and unfathomable, where dragon spirits dwell. Within the pool lies a stone that is always dry, yet in times of drought, when the villagers pray to it, the stone’s surface becomes moist and water emerges. This is known as the *Hua Chi Sacred Water*, and those who seek it with devotion find it ever responsive. Rain follows the water’s flow, hence the poets call it the *"Drought-Relieving Spring."* The villagers have long worshipped the deity and tended the pool, building a hall above it, named *Hua Chi Hall*. From the Tang through the Five Dynasties and into the Song, all petitions met with divine response. In the Song, the deity was granted the title *Xian Shi Zhenren* [顯施真人], and later ennobled as *Jia Run Hou* [嘉润侯]. Such is the singular virtue of the *Hua Chi Sacred Water*.

Yet the hall, with time, fell into disrepair, unworthy of the divine’s abode. In the year *Gui You* [癸酉], Li Yin alone took up the cause, rallying Li Ge and Chen Sigung to gather the villagers, expand the foundations, and rebuild the fragrant pavilion. Their labor was magnificent—until the year *Wu Chen* [戊辰], the fourteenth day of the third month, when suddenly a heavenly fire consumed the hall, reducing it to ashes. The villagers mourned its loss.

Li Yin, the former overseer of the hall’s repairs, once again led Zheng Xi, Chen Jian, Li Ge, and the late *Du Dao Lu* of the observatory, Yan Zimei, along with the observatory’s officials Dong Maohua, Guo Maozhao, Chen Weifu, Chen Weisu, Qiu Weining, Cui Ziyuan, and Cui Jushi. Together, they pledged their sincerity, declaring that the *Hua Chi* deity’s wonders benefit the people, and that its image and hall must be restored without delay. They gathered the villagers, collected the necessary offerings, and commissioned the reconstruction. Swiftly completed, the hall shone anew—a truly splendid achievement.

Li Yin’s repeated efforts in leading the people’s labor were no small matter. Yet after the work’s completion, the contributions of the other overseers went unrecorded. If their deeds are not inscribed on stone, the glory of the restoration will fade from future memory.

In the year *Ding Chou* [丁丑], during the *zhongqiu* [仲秋] of the twentieth day, I happened to be teaching Daoist doctrine at the observatory’s gate. The chief overseer then requested that I compose this record—not to embellish with empty praise, but to faithfully record the truth for posterity, ensuring its enduring transmission.

Composed on the *zhongqiu* day of the *Ding Chou* Year.

**Prayer for Rain**
In the *Dading* [大定] Eleventh Year, the year *Xin Mao* [辛卯], on the *yisi* [乙巳] day of the fourth month, the twenty-fourth day, *Wushilang* [將仕郎], acting as the *Zhu Xianfu* [主簿] of Linfen County, respectfully offers incense, tea, wine, and fruit as an offering, and dares to proclaim this prayer to the *Hua Chi Jia Run Hou* deity.

It is said that the people are the foundation of the state and the essence of divine authority. Thus, a state without its people cannot defend its altars, nor can a deity without its people receive proper sacrifice. Therefore, the fate of the state and the divine are intertwined with the people’s fortunes and sufferings as one.

**Prayer for Rain**
In the *Dading* Eleventh Year, the year *Xin Mao*, on the *yisi* day of the fourth month, the twenty-fourth day, *Wushilang* (a county official), acting as the *Zhu Xianfu* (registrar) of Linfen County, **Hao Jing**, respectfully offers incense, tea, wine, and fruit as an oblation, and ventures to proclaim this prayer to the deity **Hua Chi Jia Run Hou** (Lord of Auspicious Pools and Fertile Rain):

Indeed, the people are the root of the state and the source of divine reverence. Thus, a state without its people cannot protect its ancestral altars, nor can a deity without its people be properly worshipped. Therefore, the prosperity and adversity of the state and the deity are inseparably linked to the people’s fortunes and sufferings.

From this spring into summer, the timely rains have been delayed or excessive. The two crops of wheat have already failed to grow, and autumn planting has not yet begun. The land and the people alike lack food. Every day, the cries of hunger grow louder, and soon they will scatter to the four directions, perishing in ditches and ravines. Then, those who govern the people and receive their sacrifices—how can they find peace?

The deity holds sway over thunder and rain, grasping the reins of wind and clouds. If it rises in majesty, then all living beings in the four quarters will be blessed by its grace, securing the foundation of the state and ensuring the deity’s eternal reliance upon the people. How could this not be glorious?

Now, in obedience to the great prefect’s command, I humbly visit the shrine below, bearing sacred offerings to serve the deity. May the divine dragon gather its essence, and within three days, let sweet rain fall abundantly. This is the deity’s benevolence, the people’s hope, and the good fortune of the county magistrate.

May the deity continue to accept offerings.

**Thanksgiving for Rain’s Return and Water’s Favor**
**Hao Jing**, respectfully offering incense and fruit as an oblation, ventures to proclaim this prayer to the **Hua Chi Zhenjun** (True General of Auspicious Pools) and **Jia Run Hou** (Lord of Auspicious Rain):

Recently, due to the untimely rains, I prayed humbly at the shrine below, and the deity graciously bestowed sacred offerings. Before the second night had passed, the sweet rain responded, and the four borders were drenched. All grains sprouted, the state found tranquility, and the deity’s blessings were also abundant.

Now, I again present sacred offerings to the shrine below, in gratitude for the deity’s favor. May the deity observe this.

May the deity continue to accept offerings.

**Prayer for Rain**
**Guo Yinxiu** and others, respectfully offering incense and fruit as an oblation, venture to proclaim this prayer to **Jia Run Hou** (Lord of Auspicious Rain):

The Dao/Way is boundless, yet sincere devotion can move it. All prayers are made to reach the unseen, relying upon the deity’s wisdom to respond. Now, the season is one of scorching heat, and sweet rain has long been absent. The people’s grievances accumulate daily, and we deeply revere the Supreme Sage’s mercy and earnest aid. We humbly pray that dark clouds surge forth, extending to the distant horizons of the boundless sky, and that the divine dew spreads universally, reaching every place illuminated by the sun and moon.

Let dust settle and crops revive, transforming calamity into abundance, eradicating pestilence and bringing joyous blessings. May every living being bask in Heaven’s grace, all receiving the Dao’s/Way’s nourishment.

**Thanksgiving for Rain and Eradication of Pestilence**
We humbly acknowledge that the divine dragon has bestowed blessings, fulfilling the august ruler’s auspicious signs. The wind and rain have come in due time, fully demonstrating the power of sincere devotion. When misfortune is averted and prosperity ensured, the clouds and thunder merge, reviving withered crops and washing away the lightest dust.

With hearts delighted by the blessings and fields flourishing, we see signs of abundance and know that pestilence will not recur. The granaries hold hope, and old and young alike are free from hunger. Thus, we rely upon the sacred virtue of the Jade Dragon, repaying the True Sage’s favor, sharing in the great blessings, and equally receiving the deity’s abundant grace.

**Prayer for Snow**
**Wang Lianghan**, respectfully offering pure libations and diverse sacrificial foods, presents this prayer to the **General Hua Chi** deity:

The deity has long protected this region for a thousand years. The people know their reliance upon the deity, and thus their expectations are great. Would the deity abandon them now?

Since autumn’s eighth month until today, more than one hundred and fifty days have passed, yet the land remains parched and dust-choked, with no sign of rain or snow. Many among the people are afflicted, and the wheat is mostly withered. Next year’s harvest is in doubt, and the people bear sorrowful expressions. Is this not because Lianghan’s governance is flawed? Or is there perhaps an unresolved grievance?

Yet, if governance is flawed or officials are negligent, how have the people sinned? We humbly pray that the deity, moved by love for the people, swiftly sends blessed snow. May the people have hope for a joyous celebration, so that official levies may be easily fulfilled without fear of evasion, and bandits may cease, allowing all to peacefully tend their livelihoods.

May the deity observe this.

May the deity continue to accept offerings.
