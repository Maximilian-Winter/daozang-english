**Wudang Record of Marvels**
*By Luo Tingzhen, the Cloudy Peak Woodcutter of Longxing Prefecture*

**First Stanza of the Woodcutter’s Song**
Gathering firewood, I journey afar to Mount Taihe,
Where mountains dwell as immortal grotto-palaces.
Wind and dew of the nine heavens brush the cinnabar gates,
Heaven and earth endure through ages—white clouds ask.
Moonlit crags dissolve the heart’s cares,
Steps tread the celestial heart in comings and goings.
A land of joy, vaster than the heavens,
Unknowing of the dusty world beyond.

**Second Stanza**
Grotto-heavens and blessed lands fill the mortal realm,
The Northern Emperor’s abode receives homage from the north.
Resplendent Wudang links with Mount Gen,
Its towering summit presses upon the earth’s expanse.
Boundless sacred transformation—golden palaces,
The supreme divine realm mirrors Jade Clarity.
Auspicious gatherings of wind and cloud align with sun and moon,
Incense ranks in homage arrayed like rosy clouds.

**Jieshan**
Where celestial beings tread, steps diverge,
At Junyang’s border, one enters the clouded thoroughfare.
Lightly drifting, imbued with the qi of immortals,
Leaping in the eastern wind, chanting the *Dance of Yu*.

**Lang River**
Trickling drops swell into an ocean’s vastness,
After rain, ten thousand ravines surge with whale waves.
The staff of blossoms steadies the journey like Shangchuan’s cane,
Blessed by clear skies, one crosses perilous slopes.

**Mei Creek**
Ren and Gui store essence, nurturing sages and spirits,
Yang within Kan reveals the sprouting of benevolence.
Benevolence’s roots warm the southern branches,
The Emperor’s work brings spring to all under heaven.

**Guanzhuang**
Feasting on celestial blossoms, immortals of the heavens,
They store the sky’s chill, enriching the celestial fields.
Beyond mountain fire-jujubes and exchanged pears,
Granaries of decay and hardship extend longevity.

**Chengzili**
Green piled upon red, brocade encircles all,
A natural painting—this mountain stream.
A single altar’s circuit opens the path,
Before pine and bamboo crags, peach and apricot trails.

**Haokou**
One side mugwort, the other orchid,
At the gate of profit and desire stands the gate of Dao and righteousness.
Mortals and sages diverge—where to turn one’s steps?
Where five-colored clouds gather lies Penglai Mountain.

**The World’s Wudang**
The foremost pass to transcendence and the sacred,
Junyang’s blessed land excels all in the mortal realm.
Where heaven’s canopy meets the pole star,
For ten thousand ages, heaven and earth share this mountain.

**Jiedai Hermitage**
From distant seas, incense is raised in offering,
Who can fast and embrace flying immortals?
At the post station, one feasts on azure essence-rice,
Exerting strength to ascend the mountain—reaching the nine heavens.

**Land of Maoshan’s Earth God**
Offering wine from Gongyan, fragrant and rich,
Externally guarding the sacred mountain, fulfilling duties with diligence.
If merit is achieved, it shall be rewarded,
Also enfeoffed with land, granted as a meritorious minister.

**Mountain Spirit Hall**
No need for pigments—its numen manifests,
The temple’s vigor draws from the earth’s essence.
When the heart of Dao merges with the human heart,
Even silent thunder strikes with awe.

**Outer Audience Peak**
Grass and trees, imbued with spirit, sense the sage’s grace,
Every mountain follows the multitude to pay homage at the golden gate.
From distant peaks, one turns to summon immortal companions,
Joining the ranks to behold the Supreme.

**Black Tiger Shrine**
A leopard’s transformation begins, patterns yet unformed,
Its refinement concealed, it already surpasses the crowd.
The Dark Heaven’s discipline patrols the corridors complete,
Claws and talons hidden deep in iron-hued clouds.

**House of the Kalpa**
From the era of Ao’s rise to the present,
How deep have the years stretched in this household?
From the age of Fuxi and Nong onward, people endure,
Child and grandchild—hearts of primordial antiquity.

**Sword Mound**
Who emerges from the peaks, a lone cloud?
Flowers and moon bewitch halfway along the path.
A thunder-axe concealed in yellow earth’s wine,
Evil spirits stripped of souls die in Dengdu.

**Grindstone Gorge**
Through tempering, the coarse becomes refined,
The sagely master summons one to the celestial capital.
My heart is not stone—firmer than stone,
When the small vessel is complete, the great Dao is achieved.

**Yang River**
The land does not belong to Su Wu’s exile,
Nor is the water first named from paper and milk.
Its source is the vein of a sacred spring,
Flowing clear even at the sea’s gate.

**Sword-Grinding Gorge**
The imperial perfected one is truly the guardian of Dark Heaven,
Forging metal through the kalpa in cold purple mist.
Three feet unfurled, spanning seas and mountains,
Purifying the cosmos—a single dragon spring.

**Hidden Immortal Crag**
Crucible and cauldron refine through countless days and months,
Amid the mountains, embroidered robes yield to a green straw cloak.
Even white clouds know not the immortal’s traces,
Now in which heaven does the jade flute resound?

The Qian gate swings wide, never closing at night.
Step by step, this pass is thoroughly fathomed,
A single immortal’s path ascends the azure void.

The supreme sage descends, halting the morning chariot,
Dragons soar, phoenixes dance—ten thousand mountains coil.
The front peak’s ministers wear caps and robes,
Gazing toward the palace, they hail longevity and peace.

The sacred altar’s words echo in the celestial court.
Once, the Dragon Lord’s seat listened to lectures,
Still arrayed like pearls in the five stars’ order.

The ten continents and three isles lie in Junyang.
All perfected ones, in thought, return to the banner’s truth,
Morning riding azure dragons, evening on rainbow phoenixes.

Universally aiding all heavens to pay homage to Great Harmony.

The imperial house’s jade and silk—ten thousand lords.
Atop the mountain, ranks stand in solemn order,
Resembling the twelve towers of the five cities.

Ten thousand sincere hearts for ten thousand sagely perfected,
Where is there a place incense is not offered in person?
Year after year, spring months like a bustling market,
From the sea’s edge to the sky’s end—people come.

**Celestial Palace**
A treasure mountain suspended, far from worldly clamor,
High in the ninefold heavens, and ninefold again.

All who ascend witness the August Lord in person.
The Great Summit’s root stands first in height,
Climbing high, they bow in thunderous reverence to Heaven’s Gate.

The Celestial Court of the Supreme Lord is naturally so,
Jade skies and boundless darkness stretch without end.
Radiance descends to the Three True Realms,
A realm apart—where mortals ask of the heavens above heavens.

Rewarded for merit, they know to soar.
Adorned in resplendent hues of golden scales,
They rise to the highest tier of the Lingyan Pavilion.

His thunderous roar subdues ten thousand demons.
Gathering his divine might into his grasp,
Majestic yet not fierce, he commands solemn ranks.

He subdued the capital’s west, guarding ancient Xiang.
Wind and rain he brought under the Dark Emperor’s command,
Now he oversees all as Heaven’s gatekeeper.

**Hall of Marshal Meng of the Thunder Bureau**
Once his ambition lay in the Central Plains,
Crushing Cai, vanquishing Jin for the Yuan.
Heaven feared thunder’s wrath would lack oversight,
So the Three Heavens entrusted him with universal grace.

**Well of the Five Dragons**
In the first year of Han’s rise, they gathered as stars,
A gushing spring formed a pool around the shrine’s courtyard.
One by one, they soared into the heavens,
The earth’s veins fragrant and sweet, eternally sacred.

**Shrine of the Five Hundred Divine Officials**

Five hundred hold offices, each with their duties.
In two ranks, they pivot like the wind,
Like Gao, Kui, Ji, and Qi—Yao’s worthy ministers.

A pillar upholding the sky, beams like a rainbow,
Its whale-like resonance vast and resonant.
Struck in proper measure, it harmonizes all,
Golden tones and jade vibrations resound through the nine heavens.

Neither mist nor smoke at its loftiest height,
Ninefold rosy clouds envelop its joyous glow.
The first tier of the "Morning to the Origin" ascent,
Jade bamboo ranks arrayed in the azure heavens.

The Heavenly Official of Recorded Goodness holds his post,
Lowly officers tend incense and fire as extraordinary merit.
Those who fulfill the three thousand deeds,
Each scroll inscribed in golden script on jade tablets.

Within the grotto-palace, another grotto-palace unfolds,
All under heaven becomes a single Penglai.
Mist drifts, rain hats, wind and clouds gather,
None but immortals may come here.

Enticing our pines and cassias to mock the clouded ravines,
In their sleeves, memorials to present beside the Emperor.

Each a grain of the immortal’s elixir of agelessness.

Directing ranks in precise order, they offer birthday blessings.
At the northern gate of heaven’s opening,
A thunderous "Long live!" resounds, robes and crowns solemn.

Steady as a moored empty boat, a nest of peace,
How could mountain forests know of wind and waves?
A pool of still water clarifies the heart,
Embracing cloudless vastness, the universe at ease.

**Daoist Chant of Worldly Toil**
Wild horses and dust disturb the vulgar green,
Yet among the lowly, noble immortals remain.
Fragrant springs by the thousands, clouds by the mile,
By day they plow clouds, by night they draw from the spring.

**Eternal Legacy of Perfection**
Clearing thorny brambles to open the sacred altar,
With empty hands, they built a house of gold.
A thousand years of blazing incense,
A heart of iron and stone, steadfast in revival.

Several handfuls of celestial script, fragrant with rain and dew,
Wind and thunder held in the palm’s center.
The sword’s sheath shed, the immortal soul departs,
Still dreaming of riding the simurgh into the imperial realm.

Residing in the luminous virtue of one’s nature.
Emerging from the peaks with but a touch of use,
Sated with timely rains, awaiting the binding wind.

**Lecturer’s Study**
Again the locks are drawn to enlighten the unlearned,
Studying like Zhuangzi of the marshes or the Old Master by the river.
Hidden within the grotto realm, unseen by men,
Yet the heart’s treasury lies deeper still in the Six Classics.

Silver streams pour forth, blessing the deep source.
Early on, it serves the world’s teeming multitudes,
When the sun burns like fire, it becomes the saving rain.

Assisting the Heavenly Emperor, honoring the king.

Ink tinged with floating fragrance, reaching the purple palace.

No need for robes and caps to be those of Qin’s folk.

A silver thread hangs, abundant and fine.
Not to withhold the rain’s key in stubborn closure—
The jade cliffs shift, stones stir, winds and waves arise.

The water’s pulse connects to the Luo Grotto,
The stream brims with strange stones—torpid dragons.
The earth immortals’ nine halls are not far,
Their root-realm comes to pay homage to the nine-tiered heavens.

**Small Green Sheep Gully**
The Dongting shepherd resents his lifelong duty,
Though the dragon maiden is divine, she has not attained true spirit.
Purifying himself, he drives them forth to seek enlightenment,
Yet his steadfast heart turns to stone, neighbor to stone.

**Resting Immortals’ Rock**
Riding qi and wind, they traverse the ten thousand heavens,
The assembled Perfected till the clouds by day and night.
Pausing their jade pendants in the Jasper Flower Grotto,
They recline at a feast of flying cups on a tortoiseshell mat.

The Dark Heaven’s ancient might commands awe,
At its summit, the Black Killer’s banner flies high.
No need for the great god’s twin arms—
The winds and clouds on all sides sustain it forever.

**Master Xi Yi’s Rock**
The immortals’ wondrous method is transmitted heart-to-heart,

Pushing aside his pillow, he surveys the world’s affairs,
Then moves his couch amid the clouds to Hua Mountain’s crest.

They come and go together in five-colored cloud chariots.

**Jade Immortal Rock**
The golden crucible tames coiling dragons and tigers,
The immortal’s recipe—pine and citron—is the heart’s elixir.
When the grotto gate’s lock opens to the clouds,
A myriad miles of flying cranes widen the cosmos.

**Subduing Demons Peak**
Steep cliffs, verdant heights, stone swords piercing the sky,
The Celestial Perfected’s karmic mandate guards the sacred altar.
The Dragon Spring is sealed within a golden lotus casket,
Its unshining radiance chills the demons’ hearts.

A single sacred sprout stirs purple mist,
The earth’s essence warms, lush as Lantian’s fields.
The Daoist’s primordial qi is wrapped in spring’s rebirth,
The entire valley plows white clouds at noon.

**Cloud-Rosy Abbey**
Several strands of golden light, their hues resplendent,
Jade pendants flutter as ten thousand immortals descend.
Where the five dragons alight in ordered ranks,
A new, secluded grotto-heaven of vast yang is created.

**Dragon Pool**
Half a deep pool stilled, brimming with Yu Gate’s waves,
Its location ordained for a celestial gathering.
Awaiting the nine heavens’ thunderous roar,
It will surge straight up to the azure clouds.

**Thunder Grotto**
Nurturing the precelestial, restoring earth’s yang,
The Heavenly Lord rides the jade dragon in concealment.
Within, the axis of heaven and earth turns,
A single ladle of numinous spring rains the eight wilds.

**Southern Rock (Renamed: Celestial Yi’s True Blessing, Longevity Palace)**
Unlocking heaven’s treasury, expanding the sacred realm,
Pure yang immortals occupy pure yang’s domain.
Clouds and rosy mists, jade hues—beyond the mortal world,

Jade well’s abyss, deep with rippling green,
The Celestial Perfected’s primordial sun refines the elixir pool.
Its waters, fragrant through the ages, are all celestial wine—
May the drowned be cured, drinking but a single cup.

**Celestial Bridge**
From the hanging cliff, cascades plunge to the peak’s waist,
Entering cultivation here, one already soars the nine heavens.
Humans too build suspended walkways linking towering halls,
Gazing ahead, each step spans ten thousand leagues.

The Sage Emperor’s western retinue, the Sage Friends gather,
The Sacred Parents’ throne stands at the center.
Left and right, incense clouds coil and billow,
The Celestial Yi’s Purple Tenuity True Blessing Palace.

**Shrine of the Southern Rock Perfected**
The Great Summit looms before all eyes,
Streams and mountains encircle its emerald, facing the peak’s tip.
Wudang’s marvels, the marvel of marvels—
At first glance, the celestial Perfected dwell beneath the eaves.

Myriad ravines and cliffs gather the essence of beauty,
Its solemnity needs no ritual form.
Say not that gods and spirits truly reside here—
Even wood and earth, lifeless, radiate numinous power.

**Southern Rock’s Sea Convergence**
How compare tripods to the furnace of water and fire?
Nobles joyfully offer alms, entering the Mystic Capital.
The Patriarch convenes to transmit the mind-seal,
Each bestows the talisman of ascension and celestial mandate.

**Abiding Immortal’s Reclusion**
Golden abyss, jade sea swell with literary waves,
The eighth-month sky’s winds ride the ocean’s heights.
Heroic qi gathers within clouds and ravines—
From the immortal isles, he strides a golden turtle.

**Trial Heart Stone**
The world’s human sentiments are treacherous as iron,
Yet when the spirit is whole, the realm is surely level.
Walk the Way with ease, though the crags be hollow—
Ten thousand fathoms deep is no peril.

For long, his spirit descended before the Emperor,
Yet form is not the true mystery of the Dao.
From the layered cliffs, he casts off his dust-laden body,
Roaming the six directions, governing the ten thousand heavens.

**Gratitude to Heaven and Earth Rock**
Momentarily moved by the vault of heaven, speechless,
From the cliff’s root, he reaches the celestial court.
Only when the shed bones are securely hidden does he lightly rise,
Freely roaming as a spirit, attending the Jade Clarity.

**Valley of Ten Thousand Households**
Immortal dwellings stretch across verdant peaks,
Ridge clouds probe the locks of layered green.
Within the grotto, heaven and earth are vast from the start—
A fiefdom’s households all find ample space.

**Ox Ford Gorge**
Of old, the Old Lord crossed the Hangu Pass,
Riding a green ox, he passed this way.
Now, as the Dragon-Horse appears in the revealed diagram,
Daoists play with the *Yijing* by murmuring streams.

**Azure Sheep Gorge**
For a thousand years, incense and verse recall Xie’s Pool,
A single line from the Western Hall—a dreamt poem.
Rooted in duckweed and pondweed for offerings,
It transcends to the flourishing age of the royal *feng*.

**Imperial Cliff Peak**
The earth’s weight shifts, yet it remains serene and focused,
The Dao’s words correspond above to the Great Peace Heaven.

Neither existing nor void, at the vast desert’s edge.

It forbids the great yawn to shake heaven’s pivot,
The grand cosmos

Yet here remains the ancient harmony of Yong.
A plot of the Old Master’s springtime terrace,
Ever abiding in the flourishing age of Tang and Yu.

Cliff and ravine, dark and deep,
The royal heir pressed on to learn immortal arts.
Ascending through the ages as the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor,
How many kings of former dynasties matched his years?

Clouds drift from peaks without intent—yet they exist,
Heaven and Earth bestow their grace to the eight directions.
In the towering ravines, a spontaneous joy arises,
At the summit, one burns incense and sits to watch.

**Verdant Cloud Crag**
Worldly affairs shift and twist with deceit,
White robes and gray dogs change in an instant.
Yet a single green qi floats through the ages,
Vaguely recalling the Mercy Palace’s boundless reach.

**Longevity Palace**
Golden crucible, elixir void—dragon and tiger grow cold,
This pine, hollow with age, guards the immortal altar.
When shall the Penglai Hall open once more,
To gaze at the five-colored clouds and pray for peace?

**Summit-Gazing Peak**
Human worth varies on these purple-green heights,
Yet all revere this place where scholars seek worthiness.
The foremost peak aspires to sagehood,
But only Heaven stands beyond all comparison.

**Return-to-Court Peak**
Sleeves filled with celestial fragrance, stepping from the palace gate,
Delighted to join the Queen Mother’s feast in the Western Kunlun.
Still, the heart clings to the court with loyal devotion,
Rushing to join the morning assembly before the August One.

**Grand Constancy Office**
Offerings and counsel dwell beside sun and moon,
Yi and Kui’s rites and music align with Shun’s ranks.
The White Cloud Office guards the White Cloud Grotto,
Its earthly place in the sacred mountain, its duty in Heaven.

**Protector-Sage Office**
Holding Heaven’s northern pole, the office of the celestial pivot,
The Northern Pole’s pivot court bears the same charge.
Thunder and lightning rush forth at its commands,
How many secret scriptures of the Three Realms pass through?

The registers of perfected immortals receive imperial favor.

**Martial Majesty King’s Temple**
Born with solemn resolve, yearning for the mysterious,
Graced by karmic favor to guard the sacred mountain.
Silent, formless, beyond sound in the darkest depths,
Yet thunder, lightning, wind, and storm answer to his gaze.

**Cloud Grotto Hermitage**
Which tier of the sacred mountain’s retreat is this?
A thatched hut, tightly sealed, concealing its traces.
Deep within the shadowed vale, coiled and hidden,
Perhaps in a former life, it was the Five Dragons.

**Purple Empyrean Spirit Spring**
Half a pool beneath the stone, a small hill’s embrace,
The sea’s dust scatters, yet its flow never ceases.
Each drop sustains thousands upon thousands,
Divine workings transform countless autumn pools.

The heir apparent ascends to the White Cloud Mountain.
How could a mere stream block the path to a mother’s love?
Awaiting the day he faces the Celestial Countenance in Heaven’s Palace.

**Nine-Wave Service**

Great banners and lofty standards escort the Six Dragons.

Heaven dwells at its roots, granting eternal life.

**Ten-Thousand-Year Pine**

Not in lofty grandeur to rival the Han’s heights.

Unaging through wind and frost, its root of longevity firm.

Its qi pure and unyielding, wondrously congealed,
The Western Venus radiates auspicious light.
Its scattered brilliance fills Heaven and Earth,

It remains to guard the sacred mountain’s highest peak.
Grain by grain, cinnabar—a treasure of the world,
Its auspicious glow illuminates the night sky.

Ten thousand strands of trailing silk drape the green mist,
For millennia, it sways and coils.
Fully transformed, it robes the court in splendor,
Adorning the Golden Gate across ten thousand heavens.

The Daoist lineage of Zhuang and Lao studies emptiness,
Yet diligently doing good, it follows Shun’s path.
Observe that bird—its meaning lies beyond words,
For three thousand meritorious deeds are true mastery.

At the Coming Phoenix Terrace, it emulates swift flight,
Recording offices like the phoenix at the Guest Gate.
When celestial visitors arrive, the flock calls in unison,
Leading the crane’s ranks to audience with the Sacred One.

The Supreme Clarity’s refined strains, rare in the world,
Neither bamboo nor silk, but five-colored birds.

The numinous phoenix arrives with a single heart.

The Dao is everywhere, inherent in all nature,
Every moving thing, every living being, holds reverence.
Its teaching’s work mirrors Heaven’s nurturing embrace,
Who in this life can stand apart from Heaven and Earth?

Feathered robes of pure jade, a deity of Yizhou,
Facing east, it guards the sacred mountain’s truth.
Transformed to soar in the palace courtyard, nesting with the phoenix,
Its wings support the imperial carriage to the Celestial Ford.

**Spirit-Longevity Staff**
An ancient pine’s bones, the Valley Spirit’s elder,
The Great One’s true essence, an ancient staff’s might.
Spared the taint of Kong Guang’s treacherous hands,
Its years in the mountains match Heaven’s own.

**Kan Forest Tree**
A wondrous marvel of the Seven Treasures Forest in the upper realms,
Branch by branch, kingfisher jade, leaf by leaf, lapis lazuli.
Had it not dwelled atop the Great Summit in Heaven,
How could its divine root claim such uniqueness?

**Mind-Stabilizing Pine**
A green official, Heaven-sent, exuding human grandeur,
A single stone, rootless, towers ten thousand feet.
Leaning like Mount Tai to peer beyond the Dipper,
Its iron body upholds an emerald canopy in the void.

**Cloud Bamboo Staff**
Bestowed in purple, concealed in forests and springs,
In times of peril, it upholds the state as a great worthy.
The world’s path is smooth, Heaven’s course steady,
Lao Ge invites it to accompany the immortals.

A few branches of flame glow in silver vats.

Its roots, full and substantial, endure through the years.

**Night Furnace**
By moonlight, the golden crucible simmers,
Even plain rice, untainted by green essence, may lead to immortality.

Humble as weeds, yet precious as golden jade,
Fire forges the elixir to transmute bones and ascend.
Refined within the cauldron of creation,
The drug of longevity needs not seek Penglai.

**Black Tiger Elixir**
Majestic as a bear’s solemn march,
On wild cliffs and mountain walls, dusk lingers.
Within the spoon, fangs and claws stir,
Aching ills and pains—mere tricks of the black donkey.

**Chuanxiong Cakes**
Sharp attacks on head and eyes, bitter with hollow pain,
The immortal’s remedy wields mighty force.
Flake by flake, snow-like blooms from Shu’s finest,
No need for ablutions or the Three Vehicles’ discourse.

**Mugwort-Essence Pill**
Amid thorny thickets lie ginseng and poria,
The emperor’s tribute, blessed by earth’s spirit.
Though seven years of true illness may persist,
The mercury furnace’s merit blazes in cinnabar script.

**Sweet Tea**
Cultivating the Dao, its taste is plain yet divine,
Self-cultivated cloud-fat, plucked jade blossoms.
Since ancient times, it has sweetened mortal lips,
A spring breeze for a hundred million lives.

**Wudang Illustrated Scroll**
Ascend ninefold skies to witness great harmony,
Spiral through eight hundred li of mountains and rivers.
A thousand verses of brocade could not exhaust its splendor,
Yet a single painted scroll—does it suffice?

Moments of wind and moon take on new grace,
How do mist and clouds shift in their forms?
To see beyond the scroll itself,
Is to find the mountains’ endless vistas.
