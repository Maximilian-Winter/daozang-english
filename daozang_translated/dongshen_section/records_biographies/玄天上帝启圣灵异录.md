### *Record of Marvels at the Yuan Dynasty’s Founding of the Zhenwu Temple*
Composed by Xu Shilong, Hanlin Academician and Lecturer, concurrently Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue

In the tenth year of the emperor’s reign, the new great capital was established in Yan, its completion imminent. In the twelfth month of that winter, on the day *gengyin*, a divine serpent appeared in the waters of Gaoliang River west of the city. Its body was azure, its head radiant with golden splendor, astonishing all who beheld it. Incense was burned in offering, and the serpent coiled forward to partake before departing. The following day, *xinmao*, a sacred tortoise emerged, its shell inscribed with golden patterns, its auspicious light resplendent, lingering for a long while. Now, this was the season of winter’s closure and concealment, when tortoises and serpents lie dormant—yet they appeared at this time, clearly manifesting as divine beings.

Thereafter, word reached the inner palace of the empress, who dispatched an imperial envoy to inquire among the people. All affirmed that this was the manifestation of the Dark Warrior deity. Thus, an edict was issued to construct a shrine at the site of the apparition in the second month of the following year, on the day *jiaxu*, to honor the deity’s numinous presence.

According to the *Wenyao Gou*: "The Black Emperor of the Northern Palace, whose essence is the Dark Warrior, is the divine sovereign of the northern direction." Our dynasty’s foundations were laid in the northern lands, its flourishing virtue aligned with the Water phase. Now, as the Son of Heaven surveys the four quarters and establishes the capital, in this month when the Water phase prevails, the deity has deigned to descend. This portends the extension of our august fortune, the flourishing of our mandate, and the inauguration of a realm of eternal peace. Ah! The temple is newly built, and the deity has graciously accepted our veneration. Henceforth, may wind and rain arrive in due season, may the harvests be bountiful, and may the people ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity. May our sagacious empress assist the sacred Son of Heaven in revering the divine will.

I, Shilong, unworthy in my literary office, have been privileged to witness this auspicious sign. I dare not conceal the truth and thus record it here.
*Written on a day in the second month of the seventh year of the Zhiyuan era.*

### *Stele Inscription for the Founding of the Zhaoying Palace*
Composed by Minister of the Ministry of Rites, Xu Shilong, by imperial decree

Our dynasty’s foundations were laid in the northern lands, where the martial might of the gods pacified the realm. The successive sagely emperors extended their dominion, and none beyond our borders dared defy their rule. The present emperor, born to receive Heaven’s mandate, has inherited the great throne. He has examined the classics and canons, embellishing the grand enterprise: establishing ancestral temples, refining rites and music, instituting official systems—all affairs of state have been renewed with splendor.

Yet the palaces remained incomplete, and the ministers petitioned to establish the capital in Yan. The emperor approved, and in the third year of the Zhiyuan era, a new capital was founded north of the old city. In the twelfth month of the sixth year, on the day *gengyin*, west of the city, in the waters of Gaoliang River south of Jinshui, a serpent emerged. It measured over a foot in length, its head gleaming with golden radiance, its back adorned with azure markings. Those who saw it marveled, offering incense and bowing in reverence. The serpent, docile and unafraid, approached, craning its neck to gaze at the people before coiling into the incense burner, lingering awhile before departing.

The next day, a divine tortoise appeared, its shell inscribed with dark patterns upon a verdant ground, swimming along the riverbank as if manifesting its numinous power. The people surmised that the tortoise and serpent were the pivots of Heaven and Earth. In this season of winter’s closure, when scaled and shelled creatures lie concealed, their successive appearances must signify something profound. Yu Diechibuhua, Supervisor of the Imperial Treasury, was overseeing construction in the western suburbs when he witnessed the event. He reported it to the empress, who consulted learned ministers. All affirmed that this was the manifestation of the Dark Warrior deity. Thereupon, funds from the imperial treasury were allocated to construct a shrine at the site of the apparition. Yu Diechibuhua was specially dispatched to oversee the project, with Minister of Works Duan Tianyou assembling artisans and craftsmen. A painted depiction was also presented to the throne.

The emperor declared: "If the divine sage can secretly protect our people, how can we fail to offer solemn sacrifices in gratitude for its numinous favor?" Thus, an edict was issued to expand the shrine’s halls and pavilions.

The palace completed, it was bestowed the name "Zhaoying." The emperor then commanded his ministers to inscribe words upon stone. Minister Shen Shilong respectfully noted: As Zhang Heng of the Han wrote in his *Fu on Contemplating the Mysteries*, "The Dark Warrior coils within its shell; the soaring serpent winds aslant." For the serpent and dragon are yang in kind, corresponding above to the Heavenly Net. The tortoise is a creature of mystery, yin in nature, aligning below with the Earthly Axis. Only when yin and yang harmonize does the divine response thus arrive.

Now our sovereign’s sagely virtue and numinous power reach both high and low. Discerning the subtle and governing the manifest, he revolves Heaven and turns Earth. In his diligent governance, his synthesis of names and realities, he follows the model of Emperor Xuan of Han. In his creation of institutions and laws, his transformation of customs, he possesses the measure of Emperor Xiaowen of Wei. Moreover, in loving the people as his children, honoring the worthy as guests, setting aside his own will to follow others, and guiding his ministers with gentle countenance and words—he surpasses even Emperor Taizong of Tang. With unceasing reverence and solemn awe for the divine, it is fitting that the Supreme August One should send down his spirit, to make manifest this illustrious virtue and prosper the grand destiny. How magnificent indeed!

Minister Shen Shilong dares to bow a hundred times and kowtow in offering this inscription. The inscription reads:

The Dark Warrior, star of mystery,
Essence of the Black Emperor.
Its advent bears signs,
Its portents bear fruit.
Its omen—fragrance of the Dragon’s virtue.

The Emperor proclaimed: "Ah! The divine presence is received, the sacred essence is upheld. Without palace nor courtyard, how shall we offer timely sacrifices? Thus, we elevate the beams, raise the pillars, and deepen the tranquility of gates and chambers—where the spirits find repose. Here we enshrine the numen of the Water Virtue: its waters are like metal, its isle like jade. The divine descends to inquire, magnifying the imperial capital. May it eternally bless the Son of Heaven with ten thousand years of felicity."

Dated the ninth month of the seventh year of Zhiyuan.

*The Stele of the Founding of the Zhao Ying Palace*
Composed by Minister Wang Mi, Academician of the Hanlin Academy, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, by imperial command.

Since ancient times, those who have ruled all under heaven have invariably established teachings through the divine Dao. The Emperor, ascending the throne with reverence, has honored all spirits in due order. The Empress, the August Mother without peer, personally administered the inner court, her virtue harmonizing with the imperial destiny. All that she undertook to mystically assist the divine and exalt the rituals of sacrifice was executed with diligent thoroughness.

According to the records submitted by the relevant offices: In the sixth year of Zhiyuan, as the capital was newly established, the Empress issued a decree to the Directorate of the Imperial Household, instructing them to survey the vacant land by the Gaoliang River in the western suburbs to settle the newly incorporated populace. Once dwellings were built and markets arranged, on the nineteenth day of the twelfth lunar month—the gengyin day—a sacrifice was offered to the spirit of the Golden Waters. It was the height of winter, when insects burrow and creatures huddle, yet suddenly a propitious radiance shone forth, approaching from the west along the water. Gazing upon it, they beheld a serpent, roughly a foot in length, its back adorned with azure markings and its head gleaming gold. The assembled crowd, astonished by its numinous strangeness, gathered in awe. Yudie Chibuhua, Supervisor of the Directorate of the Imperial Household, led his subordinates in burning incense and prostrating in reverence. They presented a tray, upon which the serpent coiled and ascended, stretching its neck to gaze about as if drinking or partaking in the offering, before departing after some time.

The following day, a divine tortoise emerged upon the waves, its back inscribed with dark patterns interwoven with gold and azure, circling and swimming with its head turned toward the shore for a long while. The onlookers marveled and sighed, deeming it a sight unseen in former times. Yudie Chibuhua reported the matter to the Empress, who then consulted the ministers versed in all things. They replied that the tortoise and serpent were the essence of the Black Emperor, and that the twelfth month, when water reigns, was the very time for such an auspicious sign—surely a manifestation of the numen of the Dark Warrior. The dynasty’s foundations were laid in the northern lands, and now, with the completion of the capital, this felicitous omen had arrived. Though the divine principle speaks not, it responds through images and categories—how luminously clear!

Thereupon, the Empress allocated items from the inner palace’s provisions and commanded Yudie Chibuhua of the Directorate of the Imperial Household to construct a temple at the site of the apparition to enshrine the spirit. She further ordered Minister Duan Tianyou of the Ministry of Works to collaborate in planning and providing labor. Upon its completion, she bestowed upon it the name *Zhao Ying Palace*. Its towering gates and spacious halls, its solemn and profound main sanctuary, its soaring eaves and ornate brackets—all aglow with golden splendor—became a magnificent sight in the capital’s environs.

In ancient times, when the Zhou house was rising, the virtuous consorts Tairen and Taisi fostered a culture of solemn harmony, their influence celebrated in odes and hymns through the auspicious omens of the *zouyu* and *linzhi*. Now, the Empress’s virtue rivals that of Tairen and Taisi, and her transformative influence parallels that of the Western Zhou. Thus, the divine tortoise and sacred serpent have appeared in auspicious manifestation—a sign that, though separated by eras, resonates with the same portent as the *zouyu* and *linzhi*.

Ah! The perspicacious perceive the subtle and know the manifest; they behold things and grasp their principles. The Empress, with her profound and sagacious insight, discerns the subtle before it takes form. She has expended gold and silk to build and exalt this palace—not for leisurely repose, nor for the pleasure of sightseeing, but to glorify the divine majesty, perpetuate the grand destiny, and fulfill the sacred intent of the Son of Heaven in establishing teachings through the divine Dao.

Having recorded these events, your servant bows his head to the ground and offers this inscription. The inscription reads:

Virtue moves the heart,
The divine knows no bounds.
What sign does the numen bear?
It proclaims the sagely Emperor.
What does it proclaim?
The twelfth month of winter.

The serpent coils and twists,
The tortoise rises from its mat.
The sage interprets the omen—
The essence of the Dark Emperor.
The imperial destiny is secure,
The realm at peace.
The palace stands by the river,
By the Empress’s decree.
For ten thousand years,
Blessings upon the Son of Heaven.
The Son of Heaven is sagely,
The Empress assists him.
Ah, all under heaven,
Bear witness to these words of instruction.

*Dated the ninth month of the seventh year of the Zhiyuan era.*

*The Stele of the Great Heavenly One True Celebration Longevity Palace at Mount Wudang, bestowed by the Yuan*

Composed by Minister Cheng Jufu, Academician of the Hanlin Academy, Drafter of Edicts, and Compiler of the National History, by imperial command.

In the spring of the first year of the Huangqing era, the capital suffered drought. Prayers were offered at all sacred sites, yet no rain came. An edict was issued to Zhang Shouqing, a Daoist of Wudang, who prayed and brought rain. The following spring, drought struck again, and his prayers again summoned rain. In summer, drought returned, and once more, his prayers brought rain. The land was thoroughly drenched, and the autumn harvest was abundant. The palace rejoiced.

In the region between Jun and Fang, there stands a mountain called Taihe, also known as Xianshi, where the Dark Warrior spirit resides, hence the name Wudang. It spans eight hundred *li*, with seventy-two peaks, the highest being Zixiao Peak. The most sublime of these is Nan Rock. Before it lie two grotto heavens: Tai’an Huangya Heaven and Xianding Ji Feng Heaven. Above, floating clouds drift; below, sheer ravines plunge. Apes cry and crows caw, while jackals and tigers make their dens. Few places allow a foothold, barely a foot’s width.

The Daoists say that in the Longhan era, the essence of Xu and Wei descended as a man, cultivating the Dao upon this mountain. Upon attaining the Way, he ascended to heaven riding a dragon—this is the Dark Warrior spirit. By the Tang dynasty’s Zhenguan era, his fame grew, and all under heaven revered and worshipped him. During the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song, an edict commanded the Daoist Master Liu to build a palace at Nan Rock, but the task was not completed.

Later, a reclusive man from the east, Lu Dayou, dwelled here. Clad in coarse garments and subsisting on meager fare, he lived thus for over forty years, rescuing the distressed and warding off calamities. He foresaw fortune and misfortune, and the people revered him as a spirit. When the imperial troops passed through Xiang and Han and crossed the river in search of the Quanzhen Dao, he journeyed west beyond the fertile lands of Long and north to the Yin Mountains. In the twelfth year of the Zhiyuan era, he returned and, with Daoist Wang Zhenchang and others, restored the altars and halls of Wulong and Zixiao. Alone, he built a thatched hut at Nan Rock. When asked to construct a palace, he replied, “This is not within your capacity. The one destined for this task is yet to come.”

In the autumn of the twenty-first year, in the ninth month, a master arrived from Xia Prefecture. At thirty-one years of age, he wished to become a disciple. Dayou rejoiced, saying, “I have awaited you for a long time.” He immediately transmitted the essentials of the Dao.

In the first month of the following spring, Dayou ascended as an immortal. The master personally undertook the labor, clearing the mountains and carving valleys, planting millet for sustenance. Leading his disciples, he cut through dense undergrowth, drove away birds and beasts, and opened a path. From the mountain’s base at Jiaokou, a seventy-*li* journey led to Zixiao Palace, and five *li* further to Nan Rock. Descending north from Nan Rock, thirty *li* brought one to Wulong Palace, and another forty *li* to the mountain’s base at Haokou.

On the third day of the third month, the day when the spirit was said to first descend, tens of thousands of men and women gathered. Offerings of gold and silk poured forth like clouds and rivers. Thus, he constructed grand halls and soaring pavilions, felling trees and bridging valleys. He carved into sheer cliffs, shaping the rock into a palace. Vast halls and grand courtyards rose, with towering halls and flying pavilions. Kitchens, storerooms, and living quarters were solemn and complete. Vermilion and azure gleamed, their radiance intertwining with the Milky Way. The statues were majestic, the bells and drums resonant. Stone paths wound through, shaded by firs and pines. Countless laborers and vast resources were expended, spanning over twenty years before completion. Hundreds of *qing* of land were cultivated to feed tens of thousands.

In the third year of the Zhida era, the present Emperor, styled "Instrument of Heaven and Ascendant Sage," and the Empress Dowager Ciren Zhaoyi Shouyuan, hearing of the master’s virtuous conduct, dispatched envoys to command the performance of the Golden Register Offering. Summoned to the capital, his prayers for rain were invariably answered. The palace bestowed the name *Heavenly One True Celebration Longevity Palace*. He was appointed to oversee its affairs.

By imperial decree, the spirit’s father was honored as *Qiyuan Longqing Heavenly Lord Bright True Great Emperor*, and his mother as *Cining Yude Heavenly Empress Jade True Supreme Immortal*. The master was granted the title *Tixuan Miaoying Great Harmony True Man*.

In the second month of the spring of the first year of the Yanyou era, Minister of Works Luo Yuan, by the Empress Dowager’s decree, rode a four-horse carriage bearing incense and silk to return to the mountain and offer sacrifices. In the tenth month of winter, Grand Academician Chen Hao requested the addition of the character *Great* to the palace’s name, now styled *Great Heavenly One True Celebration Longevity Palace*. The Hanlin Academician-in-Chief, Minister Liu Geng, was commanded to inscribe it. The Hanlin Academician-in-Chief, Minister Jufu, was ordered to compose the stele’s text; Grand Academician Meng Fu to write the inscription; and Participant in the Deliberations of the Secretariat, Minister Shi Yan, to engrave the title.

Your servant Jufu reflects: The sagely Son of Heaven embodies the essence of purity and stillness, governing with effortless virtue. As father to heaven and mother to earth, he embraces all spirits and nurtures all things, cherishing the myriad people. Rising early and retiring late, he toils for governance—this is the utmost virtue. The master, though born of cloud and mist, has revitalized the Dao and purified his virtue. With burning resolve and苦志, he has erected halls and altars to receive heaven’s favor—truly a heroic figure.

The master is forthright and resolute, dignified and steadfast. Even at grand sacrifices, he does not bathe or change attire, yet his prayers are invariably answered. Though showered with imperial favor, he remains as when he first entered the mountains—such is the mark of one who has attained the Way.

As for the spirit’s virtue, vast and boundless, its transformations know no limit. To speak of it is to invoke its ancient dwelling, where its power is concentrated. How could this not be so?

Your servant Jufu bows his head to the ground and offers this poem:

In the lands of Jun and Fang,
White clouds crown towering Mount Wudang.
Its roots span a thousand *li*, rugged and steep,
Seventy-two peaks arrayed like misty tresses.
The Emperor sent the Dark Warrior to drive away evil,
Hair unbound, long sword in hand, clad in darkness.
The towering tortoise and coiling serpent, fierce and mighty,
Ride the clouds to come and the winds to return.
I gaze afar, yet it remains distant and unattainable—
The True Man studies the Dao, carving through hardship.
Soaring a thousand *ren*, he clears the wilds,
Turning the celestial pivot, opening heaven’s gate.

Amidst jade towers and pearl palaces, verdant hues entwine,
Are they girded in golden splendor by rosy clouds and mist?
The Emperor’s profound grace, proclaimed in grand decree,
Draws the gods to dwell here, their pendants chiming softly.
Cold pines sigh, streams murmur,
Fragrance fills the air, rich with orchid and magnolia.
May the gods forever pity the people’s plight,
Sweeping away filth and impurity without ailment or affliction.
May our Emperor reign ten thousand years over the nine realms,
His sagely joy ever brightening his crimson countenance.

*Dated the third month of the second year of Yan You.*

By the grace of Heaven’s mandate, the Emperor’s sacred decree:
We have heard that in the south there is a noble deity, known as the Dark Emperor.
Born of a great nation’s auspicious omens, he cultivated the Dao upon a famed mountain.
Enthroned to guard the northern quarter, he inaugurated the imperial house’s bright destiny.
His might extended across the land, quelling the demonic vapors of all domains.
Having manifested his submission to pure order, he is fittingly honored as the Sagely Father.
The primordial vastness encompasses all limits, thus uniting the embryo of primordial *qi*.
The flourishing of the true source ensures the perpetuation of ten thousand years of blessings and prosperity.
We now bestow a noble title in gratitude for his extraordinary favor.
The Sagely Father, Pure Joy Heavenly Lord, Radiant Perfected Great Emperor, shall be further honored as the **Inaugural Origin, Prosperous Celebration Heavenly Lord, Radiant Perfected Great Emperor**.

Let the relevant authorities carry this out.

*Dated the ninth month of the first year of Yan You.*

---

By the grace of Heaven’s mandate, the Emperor’s sacred decree:
Of old, a transcendent immortal descended to be born—the Dark Emperor, a single *qi* whose wondrous workings defy description, yet all directions revere his majestic might.
His benevolent gaze spans the cosmos, vast and ever-present.
His auspicious radiance shines like the sun, resplendent and enduring.
As the era of prosperity aligns with the mandate of heaven, his grand title shall be inscribed upon the sacred registers.
His mother’s virtue is uniquely exalted, complementing the father’s eternal honor, and the sagely person is thus preserved in wholeness.
Her compassion and kindness perfectly harmonize with the imperial destiny, ever fostering its flourishing.
Thus, the **Holy Mother, Victorious Goodness Heavenly Queen, Jade Perfected Transcendent** shall be further honored as the **Compassionate Tranquility, Jade Virtue Heavenly Queen, Jade Perfected Transcendent**.

Let the relevant authorities carry this out.

*Dated the ninth month of the first year of Yan You.*

By the grace of Heaven and the sacred decree of the Emperor: the blessed land of Wudang has long been under the jurisdiction of the imperial domain. The numinous efficacy of the Mysterious Heaven warrants exalted honors. The coiled True Warrior of yore once guarded the former dynasty, establishing his temple among men and steeds, where the auspicious omens of tortoise and serpent were witnessed. Though his manifest responses have been duly revered in solemn sacrifices, the wellspring of his transcendence has yet to be proclaimed with fitting titles.

We therefore command the Court of Imperial Sacrifices to deliberate and enact rites of ennoblement. As the primordial is the chief of all virtues, his sagely power unites with the One Origin; as the sagely transforms into the numinous, his primordial merit equals that of the Three Sages. He succors and sustains the people with all-encompassing benevolence, sweeping the cosmos clear and securing the age with awe-inspiring might. His majesty resounds like thunder, and his illustrious name, once established, is most worthy. How could the bestowal of radiant favor be deemed unmerited?

The Dao of Heaven’s governance is called "Emperor," and these four characters shall henceforth hallow the mountains and rivers. The imperial house, entrusted by Heaven’s mandate, shall enjoy ten thousand years of enduring peace for the ancestral altars. May abundant blessings attend, and may the mighty be our protector.

Thus, his title shall be augmented as the **Primordial Heaven, Origin Sage, Benevolent Might Highest Emperor**.

Let the relevant authorities carry this out.

*Dated the third month of the eighth year of Da De.*

By Heaven’s gracious mandate, the Emperor’s sacred decree:

Establish and employ the August Standard to harmonize rain and sunshine. Revering the luminous spirits to dispel the lament of drought—this is the resonance of the One Principle.

You, the Water Spirit, originate in the teachings of the Daoist school and bear the illustrious name of the Earth’s Axis. You assist this guardian of the land, grieving for the farmers and mourning the lack of rain, ensuring the harvest’s timely fruition. Your numinous power shines forth—ah!—no spirit remains unsummoned. Following the traces of the former kings and acting in accord with the people, you coil your embrace around the earth below. You shall be enfeoffed as **General of Numinous Aid**.

Let the relevant authorities carry this out.

*Dated the twelfth month of the second year of Tai Ding.*

By Heaven’s gracious mandate, the Emperor’s sacred decree:

Though the rites for all spirits lack written form, they differ not from those for drought and flood. The imperial chariot’s path follows a single rule—this is the one canon.

You, the Fire Spirit, originate in the teachings of the Daoist school and bear the illustrious name of the Heavenly Pass. You assist this guardian of the land, grieving for the farmers and mourning the lack of rain, ensuring the harvest’s timely fruition. Your numinous power shines forth—ah!—the two qi, by their inherent nature, respond to utmost sincerity. All spirits receive their offices; it is fitting to determine merit and confer rank. You shall be enfeoffed as **General of Numinous Radiance**.

Let the relevant authorities carry this out.

*Dated the twelfth month of the second year of Tai Ding.*

By Heaven’s gracious mandate, the Emperor’s sacred decree:

We commend the lineage of those who cultivate the true, honoring those who attain the Dao. Body and spirit both wondrous, they dwell in secluded mountains and forests. Their essence and qi pure and complete, they command thunder and rain. Their integrity stands as a lofty model for humanity, a rarity indeed in this age. Desiring to bestow praise, We hereby promote and rename **Master of Mystic Harmony, Preserver of the True, and Guardian of the Elixir**, Zhang Shouqing, superintendent of the Temple of Celestial Unity, True Felicity, and Myriad Longevity on Mount Wudang, who studies the teachings of Laozi and tends the shrine of the Dark Emperor. He has ascended the towering peaks of ten thousand fathoms and constructed a grand edifice of a thousand halls. Though his works are accomplished through the agency of spirits, his conduct and ability suffice to command the people’s reverence. The tortoise and serpent often entwine in manifest form, while wolves and tigers flee at his gallop, their traces vanishing.

The pure heart being firmly established, the mysterious transformation grows ever more manifest. Those who vie to bow in homage at his lecture seats number nearly four thousand, while those who cannot secure a place within the outer rows have waited for thirty years. Recent ministers have spoken in his praise, and the Empress Dowager has issued summons. During repeated droughts, when the realm feared widespread calamity, he petitioned the Supreme Mystery and brought forth the joy of sweet rains. His merit has already nourished all things, and his person is fittingly adorned with exceptional honors. Let the brilliance of his cap and hairpin be enhanced, and the valleys and ravines rejoice in his steadfast tranquility.

As the True Felicity Marquis of the sacred precinct, he serves as the numinous shrine of the southern realm. Aiding and sheltering Our house, the Dark Warrior presides over the royal qi of the north. Only by exhausting his heart and thoughts in prayer may he hope to draw forth blessings. Reverence him! At this time, heed Our enlightened decree.

Let **Zhang Shouqing** be granted the title **Perfected of Mystic Harmony and Supreme Response**, and let this be duly enacted.

*First day of the tenth month, first year of the Yanyou era.*

**Preface to the *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Felicity***

The Dark Warrior, by virtue of water, governs the north. Those who rule the state truly rely upon him. Among the regions under his influence, Mount Wudang stands preeminent. His resplendent efficacy in destiny and his virtue in nurturing all things have shone through the ages, far surpassing what earlier *Records of the Divine Manifestation* could enumerate.

When the august Yuan dynasty first established its foundation in the northern lands, its virtuous destiny aligned with the heavens, and all under heaven harmonized. Thus, at the very inception of its pacification and the founding of its merit—during the depths of winter’s frozen stillness—the golden and aqueous signs appeared. Auspicious omens unfolded, presaging the nation’s prosperity in ways unheard of before. Yet no record had been transmitted.

Zhang Dongyuan, superintendent of the True Felicity Palace on the mountain, taking the recent golden and aqueous events as his starting point, revived the old *Records of the Divine Manifestation* and compiled them into the *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Felicity*. The illustrations are elucidated with text, and the work is carved onto printing blocks to circulate in the world, that it may exalt the grand enterprise and illuminate the divine majesty. Though the illustrations may not exhaust all events, nor the events all traditions, they reveal the celestial mandate’s fulfillment and align the Dark Warrior with the invincible. Thus, the transmission of this record is not merely a blessing for this Dao.

*Summer of the renzi year of the Huangqing era, written by the Fifth Celestial Master Zhang Yucai at the Hall of Venerating the Perfected in Dadu.*

The numinosity of the Dark Warrior is ancient indeed. Mount Wudang, where immortals once cultivated and ascended, has long been resplendent with wondrous manifestations, unmatched by other sacred sites. When the sagely dynasty unified the realm, during the *zhiyuan* era, the tortoise and serpent appeared in winter at the Gaoliang River. Thereupon, the Great Luminous Response Palace was built on that site to mark the marvel. Now, Zhang Dongyuan, tracing the origins of the divine, has composed the *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Felicity* to ensure its transmission to distant posterity.

The divine and the human depend upon one another. Without the divine, how could humanity revere? Without humanity, how could the divine be exalted and its glory made manifest? To proclaim this to all under heaven—is this record not far from trivial?

*Summer of the first year of the Yanyou era, respectfully inscribed by Wu Jinjie, Hereditary Master of the Five Mysteries Teaching.*

---

The **Palace of Celestial Unity and True Felicity** and the **Yuanhe Relocation Bureau** both originate from the Qingwei tradition. Huang Jun of Leizhou transmitted it to the Perfected of Hidden Harmony, Nan Jun. Zhang Dongyuan received the Qingwei teachings and thus named his palace accordingly. He further selected dozens of illustrations from the *Records of the Divine Manifestation*, appending the auspicious tortoise-and-serpent omens from the Gaoliang River during the sagely dynasty, and titled the work *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Felicity*. The contemporary Celestial Master and various venerable masters have already expounded upon it in detail—what need is there for my superfluous words?

Moreover, the exalted Perfected in heaven only assist those of virtue. When Emperor Shizu of the present dynasty unified the realm, he governed with benevolence, and the four barbarians and eight wilds all submitted without exception. The myriad people and countless multitudes all rejoiced in harmony. Thus, auspicious signs arrived daily, and numinous portents gathered like clouds. Heaven and humanity converged—truly a once-in-ten-thousand-generations convergence.

Dongyuan has elucidated these portents, making them known to all under heaven for eternal transmission. This is indeed worthy of esteem, and thus I write this preface.

*First day of autumn in the first year of the Huangqing era, respectfully inscribed by Zhang Zhongshou, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, and Compiler of the National History.*

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Heaven’s one generates water; earth’s six completes it."* The number one is the beginning of all numbers. Water is the origin of all formed things. The generating numbers are odd; the completing numbers are even. In position, they correspond to the north. "North" means "back," and the north symbolizes the human back, hence the North Star emerges as the highest point in the heavens. The character for "north" (*bei*) depicts two people back-to-back, turning away from the sun. It reaches its extreme at the winter solstice, then begins anew. In the hexagrams, it is *Kan* (☵), the water trigram. The character for "water" (*shui*) graphically resembles the *Kan* hexagram. East and west diverge as the four virtues of *Qian* (☰) and *Kun* (☷): "firmness" and "yielding." The doubled *zhen* (貞貞) signifies "steadfast correctness."

The two celestial principles reside in the Dipper. The seven lunar lodges of the north—Oxherd, Weaver Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, House, Wall—form the constellation of the Dark Warrior. The Dark Warrior is the tortoise and serpent. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird are each single creatures, but the Dark Warrior alone comprises two. It is not called "tortoise and serpent" but "Dark Warrior" because "dark" (*xuan*) is the color of red-black, which the tortoise and serpent embody. Their scales and shells symbolize martiality (*wu*), hence the name Dark Warrior.

The Dark Warrior’s divine descent began during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, when shrines were established throughout the realm. The rise of the august Yuan truly began in the north. As the qi of the north was destined to prevail, the north’s deity descended first, foretelling events. Heaven had already proclaimed it.

Mount Wudang lies in the southwest, towering and vast. The Dark Warrior’s spirit resides there. Clad in black robes, hair unbound, wielding a sword and treading upon the tortoise and serpent, he is often seen even to this day. Zhang Dongyuan, master of the Palace of Celestial Unity and True Felicity, is steadfast in his devotion to the Dao, resolute and unyielding. The Empress Dowager, having heard of him, summoned him to court.

At that time, the capital suffered a drought—no rain had fallen from the ninth month of the previous year until the third month. The Son of Heaven was deeply concerned. The Empress Dowager dispatched an emissary bearing incense to accompany Master Zhang in prayer, and rain fell at once.

Master Zhang selected the day and hour for the ritual, and soon after, rain indeed fell for several days without cease, soaking the land far and near. The Empress Dowager bestowed upon him generous gifts, which he distributed entirely among his followers, keeping not a single coin for himself. Such conduct is truly rare—one might say unparalleled—and it is no wonder the gods favored him.

Master Zhang presented the engraved *Illustration of Auspicious Felicity* and entreated me to compose a preface. I have recounted what I have heard and recorded it here. Summer, the twenty-second day of the fourth month, the second year of the Huangqing era. Preface by Zhao Mengfu, Grand Master for Palace Attendance and Academician of the Jixian Institute.

The number one is the pure *qi* of Heaven and the generative number of Water. Laozi said: "The Dao gives birth to the One." The Palace of True Felicity is named *Tianyi* ("Heavenly One"), for it is the source from which the Dao’s origin flows. The Purple Empyrean’s Heavenly Pillar stands towering and majestic—who but the Dark Warrior could be its guardian? Master Zhang of Dongyuan, through his vast vow and steadfast power, opened this mountain to the cosmos. His disciples, Tang Zhongyi and Liu Zhonghe, expanded upon his teachings and created the *Illustration of Auspicious Felicity*, depicting the events of his life. The fruits of their antiquarian diligence are gathered in this book, all verifiable and trustworthy. May it circulate throughout the land and endure for a hundred generations, so that those who ascend in the study of the Dao may behold it with their eyes and grasp it in their hearts. Through the manifest, they may awaken to the mystery of the soundless. The unfathomable spirit and boundless transformations, though myriad in number, are but the subtlety of the One within the heart. The *Book of Changes* speaks of the four virtues of the *yuan* ("origin"), yet *yuan* is also the One. *Qian* is called *heng* ("prosperity"), the convergence of auspiciousness. *Kun* is called *ji* ("accumulation"), the celebration of goodness. All people and all things share the One. The Supreme Ultimate receives this pure *qi* and this generative number, embracing and accumulating it to preserve the truth of the Heavenly One. Vast and profound, it encompasses Heaven and Earth. The *Way of Auspicious Felicity* is inexhaustible in power, and its blessings and virtue are likewise boundless—this is why the *Illustration of Auspicious Felicity* was created. Let the viewer remain unwavering in heart, for the boundless abides above, truly witnessing all. Supreme indeed!

On the *Bailu* ("White Dew") solar term of the *xinhai* year, Zhao Zha of Yunxi Naian Daoist Temple respectfully inscribed this.

The height of Heaven is beyond knowing, yet we may observe the forms of the sun, moon, and stars. The depth of Earth is beyond measure, yet we may examine the shapes of mountains, rivers, and plants. The wonder of the gods is beyond fathoming, yet we may contemplate their near-at-hand responses and transformations. This is the Dao, and Master Zhang of Dongyuan understood it well. His creation of the *Illustration of Auspicious Felicity of the Dark Warrior* attests to this.

He declared: "Mount Wudang comprises seventy-two peaks, each wondrous and extraordinary. Among them, Purple Empyrean Peak stands as the central peak of the seventy-two. Thus, its ability to summon clouds and rain and manifest numinous marvels is only fitting. Moreover, its divine ruler is called the Dark Warrior. In Heaven, he is the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations; on Earth, he embodies the spirit of the tortoise and serpent. Among the Five Phases, he is Water; among the Five Colors, he is black; and his number is One. The One as One, though numerically expressed as one, is the origin of creation. When divided, it becomes numbers, yet when spoken of, it remains the One—the source from which ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand arise. Thus, its dwelling at the center of Earth and its movement through the One of Heaven—is this not what the world calls the most divine?"

Master Dongyuan said: "Beyond this, I cannot express in words. Below this, I may yet speak of it in part." Thereupon, with his disciples Tang Zhongyi and Liu Zhonghe, he selected the most wondrous and striking phenomena, illustrated them, and transmitted them, so that all who behold them may be stirred in heart and astonished in sight, thereby awakening reverence, awe, and admiration.

I, as a successor to the Grand Master of the Mysterious Teachings, recognize Master Dongyuan’s contributions to Mount Wudang. He resided on Wudang for over twenty years, enduring hardship and laboring diligently. Scaling perilous heights and bridging treacherous paths, he planned and constructed palaces to enshrine the incense offerings, transforming the desolate mountains and secluded valleys into a splendor rivaling the grandest cities. How could one fathom the depth of Master Dongyuan’s vision and foresight? Those who aided him in this endeavor were fellow scholars of the rocky crags. As I was serving in the capital near Wudang, I was able to learn of these matters in detail.

Written on the tenth day of the first month of the first year of the Huangqing era by Yu Ji.

The god of the *Kan* palace is the Dark Warrior, born at the inception of the Supreme Ultimate and corresponding to the number of the Heavenly One. He roams the eight directions, his numinous transformations beyond measure. Through him, the myriad things are benefited, and the common people are blessed—his virtue is all-pervading. Through the ages, he has been revered with utmost devotion. Mount Wudang is the abode of those who dwell in the world to cultivate the truth. Beneath its soaring canopy rise seventy-two peaks, fiercely guarded by spirits and gods, rarely visited by mortals. Among them, the Heavenly Pillar of Purple Empyrean Peak stands most majestic.

Master Zhang of Dongyuan opened this mountain, constructing halls and pavilions of grand and magnificent scale, unparalleled in ancient times. After twenty-seven years, the work was completed—could any but the most devoted cultivator have achieved this? His eminent disciples, Tang Zhongyi and Liu Zhonghe, carried forward their master’s aspirations. Recognizing that the true records of the Dark Emperor had not been widely disseminated, they created the *Illustration of Auspicious Felicity*, depicting the events and narrating the details from beginning to end with meticulous care. They commissioned artisans to carve the woodblocks and transmit it to the world, so that viewers might grasp the events through the images and perceive the numinous through the events. Thus, all may awaken to sincerity and reverence, strengthening their resolve toward goodness and advancing toward the Dao.

Lin Zhongde, Director of the Central Administration, recounted these matters to me and requested a preface. I commend Master Dongyuan’s steadfast devotion to the Dao and the diligent intent of Zhongyi and Zhonghe. Surely, the Mysterious Wind will flourish greatly.

Thus, the book is completed.
