**Imperial Stele for the Daoist Palace of Mount Taihe in the Great Peaks**

It is said that the boundless without trace is called sageliness; the inexhaustible and unfathomably subtle is called divinity. Thus, one who moves through heaven and earth, governs yin and yang, emerges from being and enters non-being, expands and contracts in the indistinct, rides the sun and drives the moon, drums the winds and harnesses thunder, now as rain, now as clouds—warding off calamities, repelling misfortunes, driving away sandstorms to summon blessings, regulating the four seasons, controlling the myriad things as if with bellows, and shaping all beings to perfect the work of transformation—is none other than the Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor, the Perfected Martial Deity.

According to Daoist scriptures, the deity originally arose from the *Xianhe* ("Black Five Spirits") of primordial chaos, the transformation of the Great Yin Celestial One. Born with divine intelligence, perceptive of the distant and discerning of the minute, he concealed his heart in devotion to the Dao, his aspirations attuned to the Great Void. He entered Mount Wudang to cultivate inner refinement, his mind unified and will concentrated. Thereupon, the Jade Pure Primordial Lady bestowed upon him the Supreme Dao of the Limitless. When his merit was complete and his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven on a dragon, returning to his root and resuming his position. His illustrious name endures through kalpas, as eternal as heaven and earth, as enduring as the sun and moon.

Wudang was formerly called Taihe ("Great Harmony"), but it was deemed that only the Dark Warrior (Xuanwu) could befit such a name, hence it was renamed Wudang ("Martial Ascendancy"). The mountain sprawls over eight hundred *li*, crowned by seventy-two peaks, thirty-six precipitous cliffs, and twenty-four secluded ravines. The loftiest peak is called Heavenly Pillar. The most sublime site is Purple Empyrean. At South Cliff, the ethereal vapors rise above while sheer chasms yawn below, spanning the purity of the grotto-heaven and towering over the profound palaces of the blessed land. Purple Empyrean and South Cliff each have their palaces. From South Cliff, thirty *li* north lies the Five Dragons Palace. Another forty *li* brings one to the foot of the mountain, where the True Celebration Palace stands. All were sites for offering sacrifices and praying for blessings, but by the end of the Yuan dynasty, they were destroyed by war and lay in ruins—overgrown with brambles, reduced to rubble, abandoned and unvisited.

Heaven ordained the flourishing foundation of our dynasty. My late imperial father, the Grand Progenitor Gao Emperor, pacified the realm with a single army, and the deity secretly and openly assisted him, his numinous radiance resplendent. When I raised righteous troops to quell internal strife, the deity aided me at every turn—winds sweeping, thunder striking—his traces manifest. Since my ascension to the throne, abundant blessings have been bestowed, and my reverence has only deepened. Such wonders as the pomegranate and plum bearing fruit again, the harvests succeeding year after year, and auspicious omens proliferating have been unmistakable signs. Day and night, I have pondered how to repay the deity’s grace.

Moreover, the toils of my late imperial father and mother, their boundless kindness like the vast heavens, are beyond full recompense. Considering the abode of the Wudang deity, I solemnly commanded my ministers to seek an auspicious site within several dozen *li* of the Five Dragons’ convergence. There, the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heaven was constructed. At Purple Empyrean, South Cliff, and the Five Dragons, the Supreme Purple Empyrean Palace, the Great Sage South Cliff Palace, and the Prosperous Sage Five Dragons Palace were built. Atop Heavenly Pillar Peak, a bronze hall was cast, gilded with gold, and the deity’s image was sculpted to receive eternal offerings. The divine palaces and immortal abodes were resplendently renewed.

From the inception of the project to its completion, the deity repeatedly manifested his presence: auspicious lights illuminated the heavens, mountain peaks glowed, grasses and trees took on richer hues, and numinous vapors gathered and dispersed in myriad transformations. All who witnessed these wonders bowed in awe and reverence. The pomegranate and plum bore fruit in even greater abundance than before.

The Nine Lands revealed their secrets, and a golden pestle leapt forth. Yin and yang stored their essence, while the mysterious substance flowed and glistened. Wondrous signs multiplied beyond enumeration, defying all record. Such were the responses of the deity.

Thereupon, Daoist priests were appointed as superintendents to oversee each palace, ensuring the rites were conducted with solemnity, that the divine grace might be fittingly requited. Above, this was to honor and invoke the celestial spirits of the imperial father, the Grand Ancestor Emperor Taizu, and the imperial mother, the Filial and Compassionate Grand Empress Xiaoci; below, it was to pray for blessings near and far for all ministers and commoners. Though the deity roams the boundless, transforming without fixed form—responding here to a stimulus there, present wherever it turns—without this, how could Our sincerity be conveyed, or the reverent hearts of all under Heaven be bound together?

Moreover, the harmonious qi of mountains and rivers converges here, intertwining with the deity as inner and outer. When the deity descends or ascends, drifting and soaring in radiant freedom, casting its gaze upon familiar haunts, would it not linger here? Thus, the construction of these palaces and temples was not to be done without.

With due reverence, this text is inscribed and carved upon the mountain’s stele, to proclaim the divine merit for all eternity.

On the third day of the twelfth month in the sixteenth year of the Yongle reign.

**Imperial Edict:**
At the various palaces and temples of the Great Peak, Mount Taihe, those who cultivate the Dao—nurturing the spirit and preserving their true nature, embracing the One and guarding simplicity—distance themselves from worldly forms and sever all mundane affairs. Their practice of tranquil refinement admits no interruption, even for a moment. Henceforth, all wandering and disorderly persons are strictly forbidden from causing disturbances, disrupting their quiet cultivation, or obstructing their pursuit of the Dao. Violators shall be severely punished. However, those of utmost sincerity who aspire to tread the mysterious threshold, seeking to transcend the mortal realm and earnestly inquire into the truth of the Dao, shall not be subject to this prohibition. Should any Daoist neglect the fundamental teachings, stir up trouble, harm the community, or corrupt the ancestral traditions, they shall be reprimanded and expelled from the mountain at once for minor offenses. For grave transgressions, a full report shall be submitted for imperial review and severe punishment.

**Dated the eighteenth day of the tenth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign.**

**Imperial Commission:**
To Zhang Yuqing, Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Lineage and Perfected Master:
Mount Wudang is a renowned mountain under Heaven, the sacred site where the Perfected Warrior attained the Dao and manifested his numinous responses. At the end of the Yuan dynasty, its palaces and temples were all destroyed by war, leaving those who cultivate the Dao—feathered immortals and reclusive scholars—without a place of refuge. With profound sincerity, We commanded the construction of these palaces and temples, above to offer prayers for the spirits of Our late father and mother in Heaven, and below to beseech blessings for all living beings under Heaven. May the rains and sunshine arrive in due season, calamities and pestilence be averted, the harvests be abundant, and every household and person be provided for.

Now that the palaces and temples are completed, the deities have repeatedly displayed wondrous signs: radiant halos blazing in five resplendent colors, divine images manifesting within the light. Tens of thousands of onlookers have witnessed this and marveled. We have bestowed the following names: **Palace of the Mysterious Heaven and Jade Void**, **Palace of the Supreme Mystery and Purple Empyrean**, **Palace of the Five Dragons of Ascendant Sagehood**, and **Palace of the Great Sage and Southern Cliff**.

Yet such a sacred mountain and sublime site must have eminent Daoist masters to reside in and oversee it. For the **Palace of the Great Sage and Southern Cliff**, We have already appointed Sun Biyun of the Right Zhengyi Lineage as its abbot. For the remaining three sites, you shall select two practitioners of profound attainment for each to serve as abbots. Additionally, choose fifty devout and reverent Daoists for each site to act as guardians. If the full number cannot be selected at once, dispatch those you have chosen to the four sites to serve as guardians, diligently cultivating and advancing the Daoist teachings.

**Dated the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign.**

**Imperial Commission:**
To Zhang Xin, Marquis of Longping, and Mu Xin, Imperial Son-in-Law and Commander of the Capital Garrison:
The Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Lineage, Perfected Master Zhang Yuqing, has recommended and assigned Daoist officials and priests to their respective posts. The appointments are as follows:

For the **Palace of the Mysterious Heaven and Jade Void**:
- Ren Ziyuan, Daoist Official, as *Tidian* (Supervisor)
- Zhou Weizhong, Perfected Master, concurrently as *Tidian*
- Lin Ziliang as Vice-Palace Overseer

For the **Palace of the Five Dragons of Ascendant Sagehood**:
- Li Shizhong as Abbot
- Wu Jizu as *Tidian*

For the **Palace of the Supreme Mystery and Purple Empyrean**:
- Li Youran and Hu Guyai as *Tidian*

For the **Palace of the Great Sage and Southern Cliff**:
- Sun Biyun of the Right Zhengyi Lineage as Abbot
- Wang Yizhong as *Tidian* to assist him

The names of these palaces shall remain as hereby decreed. You are to take note and act accordingly.

On the eleventh day of the ninth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign.

A decree to Li Suxi, Quanzhen Daoist of the Five Dragons Palace:

In ancient times, Perfected Beings studied the Dao upon the renowned mountains of Wudang. Breaking a plum branch, they grafted it onto a *chang* tree, and prayed: "When the Dao is achieved, this branch shall live, blossom, and bear ripe fruit." Later, it came to pass as they had spoken. Thereafter, it served to foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity. In times of peace, the flowers and fruits flourished in abundance. In years of scarcity, the flowers bloomed but bore no fruit.

Today, the tree still stands. Inquiring of the elders, for a long time it has borne neither flowers nor fruit. Recently, you, Suxi, sent several hundred of its fruits to be presented, a truly rare occurrence. Could it be that your utmost sincerity has moved the Perfected Beings to bestow this auspicious sign, foretelling the nation’s prosperity?

Hereby, the Daoist Wan Daoyuan is specially dispatched, bearing incense to the Perfected Beings’ sacred precinct, where he shall burn offerings in gratitude for the divine favor. Additionally, one bolt of silk brocade, one set of multicolored silk robes, and forty ingots of paper money are bestowed upon you. You are to devote yourself wholeheartedly to praying for abundant blessings.

Decreed on the nineteenth day of the sixth month in the third year of the Yongle reign.

A decree to Quanzhen Daoist Li Suxi of the Five Dragons Palace:

Last year, the Perfected Beings manifested their auspicious signs, and the winter plum bore fruit, already foretelling a bountiful harvest. You sent envoys to present the fruits, and this year it has occurred again—truly a rarity. Consulting ancient records, such an event might be witnessed once, and even then considered a rare encounter. Yet in these two years, its fruits have appeared twice, all due to the Perfected Beings’ protection of the nation and the sincere prayers of your cohort.

Hereby, Daoist Chen Yongfu is specially dispatched, bearing incense to the Perfected Beings’ sacred precinct to express gratitude to the divine spirits. Additionally, one bolt of silk brocade, one set of multicolored silk robes, and forty ingots of paper money are bestowed upon you. You should redouble your devotion and diligence to attain the supreme Dao.

Decreed on the fifth day of the seventh month in the fourth year of the Yongle reign.

**Yellow Placard of Glorious Splendor**

**Yellow Placard of Glorious Splendor**

During the reign of our dynasty, the Noble Marquis of Prosperous Peace, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commander of the Capital Garrison, Mu Xin, led over two hundred thousand soldiers and laborers to construct the palaces and temples on Mount Wudang. The imperial edict was detailed and clearly recorded on the yellow placard.

In the autumn of the tenth year of Yongle, on an auspicious day in the ninth month, construction commenced. The yellow placard was first posted at the crossroads before the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heaven, sheltered by a towering pavilion and protected by carved railings. Its vermilion lacquer gleamed brilliantly, illuminating the mountain forests, so that all officials, soldiers, and commoners passing beneath the pavilion could not but bow in reverence. Upon reading the imperial proclamation, they understood that the grandeur of this construction arose from the Emperor’s sincere heart, expressly to manifest and repay the Perfected Beings’ evident blessings upon the nation.

Above, it offered reverence to the celestial spirits of the late Emperor Taizu and Empress Xiaoci; below, it prayed for the well-being of all living beings. How weighty and great is this endeavor!

Thereupon, the people of the prefecture, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, gathered in awe to witness the spectacle. The streets and roads were filled to overflowing, and the news spread far and wide. Even those dwelling in the deepest mountains and remotest valleys, along with Daoists and Buddhists, all hastened to behold it. The elders could not but sigh in amazement, declaring they had never seen its like in their lifetimes.

Thereafter, the pavilion was often graced with radiant light illuminating the heavens, auspicious clouds swirling about, rosy hues intertwining, and rare birds and immortal cranes flying, calling, and alighting. The Marquis, the Imperial Son-in-Law, and all from officials to commoners rejoiced together, saying: "No construction of palaces and temples in past dynasties has equaled the splendor of this day. It is fitting that heaven and humanity respond in harmony. Such auspicious signs truly mark the prosperity of our sagely dynasty and the omen of eternal peace."

Thus, the event was faithfully depicted and transcribed, along with the exhortation, upon the pavilion, so that for ten thousand generations to come, all may know what to revere.

**Black Clouds and Divine Response**

**Black Clouds and Divine Response**

When our dynasty constructed the palaces and temples on Mount Wudang, the Emperor composed a sacrificial text and dispatched the Noble Marquis of Prosperous Peace, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commander of the Capital Garrison, Mu Xin, to solemnly announce the undertaking to the Divine Warrior of the Northern Culmen. Their reverence and solemnity were thus.

Since receiving the imperial command, the Marquis and his retinue had been diligent day and night. In the autumn of the tenth year of Yongle, they arrived at Mount Wudang. On the eighteenth day of the ninth month, an auspicious day, they performed the ritual announcement.

The night before, the Marquis and the Imperial Son-in-Law, along with all officials, fasted and purified themselves, lodging at the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heaven. On the appointed day, the ritual arrangements were set before the foundation of the main hall. The Marquis and his retinue entered with reverence and awe to commence the rites.

At that moment, heaven and earth were bright and clear, the moon and stars shining brilliantly. Suddenly, a black cloud arose from the northwest, large as a chariot wheel, hovering over the mountain peak at a distance of about ten feet. It seemed to rise and fall, advance and retreat, coiling and swirling, its transformations swift and unpredictable. Within it, faint rumblings of thunder and lightning could be discerned, and the glimmer of banners and pennants appeared.

After a long while, it remained motionless. The divine presence loomed majestically above, witnessing the rite. Upon its conclusion, the cloud vanished in an instant, the four directions clear and still, leaving no trace of sound.

All who witnessed the event were filled with awe and reverence, declaring that this was surely due to the Emperor’s sincere devotion in erecting temples to repay the gods, and to the fear and obedience with which high and low officials carried out their duties. Thus, on the day of the sacrificial announcement, the Perfected Beings manifested this divine response.

The event was respectfully recorded in detail.

**Auspicious Omen in the Withered Grove**

The world has long held that the leaves of the *qian* trees on Mount Wudang possess the power to cure all manner of illnesses. Since ancient times, people have revered them, though none had ever obtained them. In the autumn of the tenth year of the Yongle reign, the imperial court commanded Marquis Longping Zhang Xin and Imperial Son-in-Law Mu Xin to oversee the construction of official Daoist temples.

The following year, as the breath of spring first stirred and grasses and trees began to revive, atop Heavenly Pillar Peak there stood a single *qian* tree, its tender shoots flourishing, its delicate leaves spreading in profusion. Its jade-like radiance and luminous hues clung to the cliffs and pressed against the rocks, its pure fragrance wafting forth, distinct from all other blossoms. Thus, it was enclosed with carved railings, and strict prohibitions were set against any disrespect.

Within ten days, suddenly at Jade Void, Southern Cliff, Purple Cloud, and the Five Dragons peaks, hundreds more *qian* trees appeared. All flourished beneath the auspicious clouds and radiant sun, thriving amid the gentle winds and sweet rains. Their lush canopies cast deep shade, blanketing the valleys in emerald. The local inhabitants who beheld this sight could not but marvel and exclaim in wonder, deeming it an unprecedented spectacle. Word spread to the four directions, and people hastened to witness it for themselves.

As the immortal blossoms vied in splendor, a crimson glow suffused the grove. The lingering rosy clouds caught the sunlight, dazzling the eyes. Rare birds with iridescent plumage alighted upon the branches, their clear, melodious songs filling the air day and night without cease. Those who beheld it were moved to even greater reverence.

By then, the green leaves had unfurled in perfect order, their rich fragrance thick and sweet. The Marquis and the Imperial Son-in-Law remarked to one another: "The leaves of the *qian* tree are especially renowned for healing ailments, as has been said since antiquity. Moreover, this year’s trees have sprouted in such abundance—could this not be the manifest work of celestial truth, revealing their divine power? With care, we shall gather them and present them to the court, appending this account to the *Records of the Manifestation of the Sage*, that their marvel may be proclaimed."

*Fragrant Plum Presages Auspiciousness*
*Fragrant Plum Presages Auspiciousness*

At the Five Dragons Palace of Mount Wudang stood a *fragrant plum*, said to have originated when a perfected adept in cultivation broke off a plum branch and placed it upon a *qian* tree, lifting his gaze to heaven and vowing: "If my Dao is fulfilled, let flowers bloom and fruit bear forth." Later, as he had foretold, the tree flourished—an event recorded in detail by the former Master Dong.

In the autumn of the tenth year of the Yongle reign of the present dynasty, by imperial command, the Marquis of Longping, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commandant-escort, Mu Xin, were dispatched to construct the palaces and temples of Mount Wudang. In the spring of the eleventh year, the *fragrant plum* burst into bloom, its blossoms red and white, their subtle fragrance and sparse shadows wafting far and wide. By the fifth month, fruit had formed, its pearls scattered in profusion, their emerald hues shimmering in radiant splendor, each branch laden with countless gems. As the lingering mist caught the sunlight, their colors dazzled the eye, and all who beheld them marveled, exclaiming: "This fruit, tended by the immortal overseers of the Bureau of Celestial Visits since ancient times, has never borne so abundantly as now. This is surely the response to our August Emperor’s utmost sincerity, for even the immortal *fragrant plum* has manifested its auspicious signs." The Marquis and the Imperial Son-in-Law gathered the fruit and presented it to the court, that its numinous wonder might be proclaimed. The event was duly recorded, that all who read of it might know what to revere and trust.

The Divine Left a Mighty Tree

In our dynasty, by imperial decree, the Marquis of Longping, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commandant Escort, Mu Xin, were charged with constructing the palaces and temples of Wudang. Over one hundred thousand logs were procured, all transported from the Han River’s banks at Hankou, straight to Junyang, with fortresses established along the route to coordinate the conveyance.

On the tenth day of the eleventh month in the tenth year of the Yongle reign, Guo Jin, Vice Minister of Works, together with Zhuge Ping, Director in the Ministry of Rites, oversaw the transport of the timber. Passing through Wuchang, they saw a single great log standing in the waters before Yellow Crane Tower. Only a foot of it emerged above the surface, like a stone pillar. Though buffeted day and night by the rushing torrent, it stood firm without human aid, unwavering. They measured the water’s depth at fifty-five feet, yet the log was only forty feet long, leaving its base suspended in the void—all who saw it marveled. When they lashed it to a boat, it followed effortlessly to the shore, as though the divine had preserved it for some great purpose. They then ordered it escorted to the mountain, and all along the river, soldiers and commoners who witnessed it gasped in awe, deeming it a numinous wonder.

The Marquis and the Imperial Son-in-Law arranged a ceremonial procession with drums and winds to welcome it, delivering it to the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heaven. They further reported the matter to the court, proposing it as the central beam of the main hall, that it might be gazed upon by ten thousand generations. The event was illustrated and appended to the *Records of the Awakening of the Sage*.

The Waters Bore a Great Bell

By imperial edict of the present dynasty, the Marquis of Longping, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commander of the Capital Garrison, Mu Xin, were charged with the construction of the palaces and temples on Mount Wudang.

On the evening of the sixteenth day of the fifth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, Liu Zhong and others, commoners of Xiangtan County, were sailing their boat to Yangbo Shoals in Guanghua County when suddenly a black gale arose, thunder and rain clashing together, forcing their vessel to halt and drift to the shore. In an instant, the wind ceased, and a great bell emerged from the waters, its form towering and vast. Thereupon, all aboard joined in prayer, saying: "We wish to carry this to the palaces and temples of Mount Wudang, that the numinous might be made manifest. Grant us an auspicious omen." No sooner had they spoken than their wish was fulfilled. They loaded the bell and set forth, the wind gentle and the waves calm, arriving in Junzhou after two days and nights.

At that time, the Marquis of Longping and the Imperial Son-in-Law, hearing the news, rejoiced and said: "This bell has long been submerged. That it should rise from the waters on the very day Mount Wudang’s temples are to flourish—could this not be the work of unseen spirits aiding us? It shall herald the mountain’s grandeur and stand as a sign of divine wonder for ten thousand generations." Thereupon, they arranged a ceremonial procession with drums and winds to welcome it, delivering it to the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heaven, where it would be enshrined for perpetual morning and evening offerings. They further recorded the event, that it might be transmitted through the ages without end.

By imperial edict of the present dynasty, the construction of the palaces and temples on Mount Wudang was commanded, with the Marquis of Longping, Zhang Xin, and the Imperial Son-in-Law and Commander of the Capital Garrison, Mu Xin, overseeing the project.

On the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, repairs were underway on the Bronze Hall atop the Great Summit. That day, a circular radiance appeared from beneath the ravine’s spring, ascending through the void. Five colors blazed resplendently, illuminating the mountain valleys. Within the light, the image of a celestial sage manifested—clad in a black robe, hair unbound, standing with auspicious clouds swirling below in protection.

On the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the sage’s image reappeared within the radiance before the Great Summit, seated with unbound hair. Two celestial deities stood in attendance on either side, as though engaged in conversation. Two more deities stood before them, with auspicious clouds swirling below in protection.

On the twenty-sixth day of the fifth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the Heavenly Pillar Peak of the Great Summit saw the circular radiance appear once more. Within the light, the sage’s image manifested again, with two celestial deities standing behind, and white clouds swirling below in protection.

On the twenty-first day of the sixth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the Purple Cloud Palace’s blessed grounds were being repaired. That day, a five-colored circular radiance appeared before the palace. Within it, the sage’s image was seen seated, a morning banner fluttering to the left amid the evening mist, held by a celestial general. To the right stood another general, bearing a sword. Below, white clouds swirled in protection, and within them, a tortoise and serpent coiled together. For a long while, the vision endured, and from that time onward, manifestations of the divine were without end.

Amidst the mountains, over two hundred thousand officials, soldiers, and common folk gazed upon this auspicious sign, none failing to rise in reverence. All rejoiced and exulted, congratulating one another, saying: "This is all due to His Majesty’s sincere heart, which has moved the celestial perfected to manifest their response, thus bestowing this felicitous omen. Since the dawn of humanity, there has been no grandeur to match the present day—truly a portent of eternal peace for the nation and a blessing for all under heaven." Accordingly, the events were faithfully depicted in sequence as above.

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the painting of the Great Summit Hall was completed. That day, dark clouds enveloped a five-colored circular radiance, within which the sage’s image appeared, flanked by two celestial deities in attendance.

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, within the radiance before the Great Summit, the sage’s image manifested again, clad in a black robe with sleeves billowing as if stirred by the wind. Before him stood a deity bearing a sword to lead the way, while another followed in attendance.

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the sage’s image appeared a third time within the radiance, preceded by a deity leading the way and followed by another bearing an imperial seal in attendance.

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the sage’s image manifested a fourth time within the radiance, with a deity bearing a sword leading before him and another holding a black banner following behind.

On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the sage’s image appeared a fifth time within the radiance, seated upon dark clouds, with two celestial deities standing in attendance on either side.

On the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the hall’s construction was completed. That day, a five-colored circular radiance appeared, within which the image of the celestial perfected sage manifested, enveloped below by dark clouds in protection.

On the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, the sage’s image appeared once more within the radiance, with a deity in attendance behind.
