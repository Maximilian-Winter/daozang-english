The Perfected Ones of the Purple Numinosity, resplendent in the Southern Cinnabar, dwell within the crimson chambers of the vaulted heavens. By concentrating the mind on lofty splendor and grasping the cloud-borne tendrils, the radiance of the vermilion essence pervades, and the Southern Dipper shines brilliantly, illuminating the ten thousand heavens. Thereby, the Six Perfected Ones—the Jade Emperor and the Great Dao Lord—are summoned forth. Revolving and ascending the path of the Vermilion Net, they instruct the various Perfected Ones in the arts of opening heaven and sealing earth, calling the sun and drawing the moon, commanding the thousand spirits, and governing the numinous qi that engenders life.

The Mysterious Writ of the Jade Clarity, when grasped, enables ascent to the celestial stalks. Proclaiming the mandate to the Six Perfected Ones, the Southern Dipper bestows life above, and the Way of life endures forever. One who receives this scripture shall have their name inscribed leaf by leaf among the immortals, capable of sitting in stillness or vanishing at will, treading upon waves or passing through fire, untouched by calamity or misfortune. Practicing its essential Way, they become an immortal king or a divine minister, their form refined and their soul transcended, enduring beyond the kalpas.

Inscribed in the Hall of the Cinnabar Heaven’s Phoenix Treasure, they swear oaths with the Upper Perfected Ones. Should they violate the revealed texts or examine the bones and bodies of the dead, they shall enter the Five Paths of Transmigration. The recipient must inscribe the cinnabar script upon a brocade pouch and wear it upon their person, practicing it in accordance with the regulations. Thus, they shall be recorded in the registers of the Eastern Florescence and attend as a guest in the court of the Lord of Dawn.

For the talismans, use cinnabar on brocade, and red orchid gold. Ascend to the Dark Terrace and pledge sincerity before heaven. Lesser officials and beginning adepts, whose virtue and power remain incomplete, must first be registered in the Yellow Registers of qi-transmission. They shall further swear blood-oaths, cut their hair, maintain perpetual abstinence, refine their essence, and bow their heads to receive transmission.

When intending to practice the Way of the Six Celestial Stalks of the Cinnabar Heaven and the method of soaring flight to ascend the stars, first place the *Treading the Void* talisman within both shoes. Thereby, the hundred spirits of the earth—corpses in hiding, impurities, and poisonous essences—will flee far away. Then, the stellar essence descends to earth, and the earth is not defiled by the yellow. The earth gods dissolve their bonds, the ground sinks into emptiness, and the diagram is laid out for ascent. Below, the abyssal depths are penetrated, flowing without obstruction, buoyant without sinking, luminous without darkness. Pacing the stars above, the starlight enters the body, and the body merges with the Dao. The stellar qi is without fixed form, responding to whatever is perceived.

Write in yellow upon purple paper and place it beneath the feet. All talismans within the scroll, except for the spoken incantations, are to be inscribed in vermilion.

Place the *Treading the Void, Turning from Earth* talisman beneath the right foot.
Place the *Treading the Void, Turning from Earth* talisman beneath the left foot.

When aspiring to become a Perfected One, if the bodily vessels are already arrayed but the heart and soul lack refinement, one must visualize the Southern Dipper within the head: one star positioned between the brows, one at the crown, and the remaining stars distributed along the jade pillow and the great vertebra. Day and night, meditate upon them until the stellar rays pierce the spine and the blazing qi arises from the bones, lest the form wither and decay. Further visualize the Six Stars and slowly swallow their essence, thereby ensuring longevity. When lying down, sitting, eating, or bathing, never face south.

Also, fashion an image of the Six Perfected Lords from cinnabar and suspend it from the left elbow (for women, the right elbow). Invoke blessings or ward off misfortune through it, and when eating or drinking, focus the mind upon it—this is most efficacious.

When aspiring to become a Perfected One, one must visualize the Six Stars within the hands, feet, heart, and brain. Over time, the Six Perfected Ones will descend their essence to refine your form, enabling the flight of the spirit to the Jade Clarity. Your form shall resemble that of a Perfected One, clad in brocade and adorned with vermilion stars.

When retiring at night, visualize the stars filling the bed-curtains like blazing fire and recite the following invocation:
*"Within the cinnabar and dark jade chamber, the light illumines the Gate of Destiny. The Six Perfected Ones of the Supreme Emperor guard the Southern Pavilion. My essence and numinous qi enter and reflect upon the Imperial Terrace. I refine and deliver the nine generations of ancestors, their souls crossing the Vermilion Mound. With purple brush and vermilion script, I open the source of life and the Way. Evil dreams and inauspicious omens are swiftly delivered to the Emperor Lord."*

The method of studying the Southern Dipper and ascending to the Crimson Capital Tower of Southern Heaven shall be practiced on the sixth day of the sixth month and one’s own birthday, with offerings of fresh and fragrant items. Present what the recipient cherishes most, and upon completing the midday offering, perform the Pace—greatly auspicious.

**Left Contract for Ascending the Southern Dipper and Attaining Longevity**

The *Mystic Chart of the Golden Watchtower’s Registrar of Destiny, the Most High Jade Emperor of the Upper Clarity and Jade Clarity*, is conferred upon those immortals who pace the Southern Asterism and bear the vermilion lineage. Possessing this scripture, store it separately in a casket and place it before the image of the Southern Dipper; carry it on your person when conducting affairs, or employ it in accordance with your visualized practices. Even without pacing, one who holds this scripture shall attain longevity as an immortal. However, it is not to be transmitted to those of inferior learning.

The Envoys of the Southern Mound, along with the sixty thousand officers and soldiers of the Three Qi of the Upper Clarity Crimson Heavens, reside within the Zi hour to guard the register and preserve the true. Those without the green bone and the script within the brain shall not hear of it. Obtaining this scripture, one is destined to become a Perfected of the Golden Watchtower; yet it shall not be bestowed upon those who serve the Earthly Offices or covet worldly gains.

When transmitting this scripture, the covenant must adhere to the statutes of the Upper Clarity, and the prohibitions must follow the law. Your servant, [Name], of [Age], respectfully presents treasured cloth and approaches the master to request the Great Register of the Crimson Heavens’ Registrar of Destiny, to ascend the Six Stars, rise to the Jade Clarity, and report to the Nine Heavens, enabling the disciple to attain communion with the mysterious and longevity, and to serve for eons as an official of the Registrar of Destiny’s imperial court.
