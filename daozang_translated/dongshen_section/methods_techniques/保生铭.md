**Inscription on Preserving Life**
By Sun Simiao, the Perfected One of the Tang

If one exerts the body in moderation, the hundred diseases cannot take form.
Avoid drunkenness in drink, and ailments will not arise of themselves.
After eating, walk a hundred paces, and often rub the belly with your hands.
Sleep not with too high a pillow; do not spit or blow your nose far away.
Trim the nails on *yin* and *chou* days; comb the hair a hundred times.
When full, stand to urinate; when hungry, sit to pass water.
In walking or sitting, avoid the wind; in dwelling, let no small drafts remain.
Never relieve yourself facing north—throughout life, one will be dull and dim.
The sun and moon are naturally to be avoided; water and fire must still be feared.
Wash the feet each night, but eating to fullness brings no benefit.
Enduring insult is the highest practice; slander severs even kin.
Anxiety harms the spirit most; joy and anger disrupt harmony and breath.
Pluck the hairs from the nose often; habitually refrain from spitting on the ground.
At dawn, when about to rise, step down first with the left foot—
For a day, this averts misfortune, dispels evil, and wards off harm.
Simply practicing the *Seven Stars Step* brings one long life and joy.

Sour flavors harm the sinews; pungent flavors deplete the upright *qi*.
Bitter harms the heart; sweet injures the will.
Excess salt shortens life—do not indulge in any one taste.
In spring and summer, allow free flow; in autumn and winter, secure the Yang affairs.
Solitude and seclusion preserve the true; caution and stillness are most precious.
Wealth and treasure are allotted by fate—knowing contentment is the greatest gain.
Forced knowledge is a great affliction; few desires bring no entanglements.
The spirit and *qi* abide naturally—those who study the Dao must persevere to the end.
Inscribe this upon the walls and doors to transmit it to the noble-minded.
