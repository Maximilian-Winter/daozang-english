**The Discerning Doubts in Nurturing Life**
Recorded by Xizhenzi Shi Jianwu

Qi has no fixed form; it waxes and wanes with the seasons. The birth and death of the myriad things share in the flourishing and decline of qi. Dwelling amidst the natural, all things know not why they are as they are. What they receive and practice lies beneath heaven and earth.

Those with form must first know their root; knowing the root, there is nothing they cannot seek to comprehend. In cultivating the Dao, one must first rectify the source; rectifying the source, there is no response the flow cannot meet. If one abandons the root to seek externally, turns from the source to pursue the perverse, even if one hunts through the hundred schools and exhausts the learning of the masters, one merely expands empty discussions of merit—truly, in terms of nurturing life’s efficacy, those who attain it see this as self-deception.

Now, surveying the world, those fond of the Dao are beyond counting. Though they know to preserve themselves through tranquility and simplicity, they are wholly unaware of the wondrous workings within tranquility and simplicity. Though they take emptiness and non-being as principle, they are wholly unaware that within emptiness and non-being, nothing is not accomplished. If one does not know the principle of the wondrous workings in emptiness and tranquility, idly committing one’s will to stillness and recklessly acting beyond form and spirit, this is called a useless endeavor, not the great progression of nurturing life.

Moreover, the spirit resides through the body, and the body is retained through the spirit. If the spirit strays externally, the body too is difficult to preserve. Some further consume herbs, trees, metals, and minerals to secure the body, yet do not investigate the natures of herbs, trees, metals, and minerals, nor discern the suitability of the four seasons’ sequences. Prolonged consumption injures the harmonious qi. Before middle age has passed, illness and harm arise together. This leads the frivolous to claim that grasping at wind and chasing shadows is futile, deeming scholars unworthy and true recluses deceitful. Is this not lamentable?

The deluded have often mocked me on this matter, saying: “I have heard that studying the Dao can lead to longevity. From my youth to old age, I have seen thousands who study the Dao—those who practice qi absorption and grain avoidance, those who command spirits and invoke the dead, those who cultivate purity and desirelessness, those who refine their conduct to become immortals. Yet among all these, I have never heard of one who did not die. Their bodies perish beneath the dark earth, and they are merely called ‘corpse-liberated.’ Reasoning thus, even those who attain the sacred vessels are but numinous bones—this is not something one can learn to obtain.”

Hearing such arguments, I could not help but feel sorrow within and dismay without. After a long silence, I sighed and replied: “What you have just said is truly base and deeply deluded! Even in worldly affairs, there are those who succeed and those who do not. How much more so with the profound and mysterious Dao, obscure and silent—how can it be attained hastily? Moreover, the great Dao is impartial; it responds when moved. To speak of ‘numinous bones’ is surely careless! Now, qi absorption and grain avoidance are esteemed by Daoists. If one truly attains them, one gains the power of not eating and the effect of bodily lightness, then claims one’s intestines are free of residue, ascends to the clouds, and attains the lightness of body to rival phoenixes and cranes. Those who consume herbs take the Hairy Woman as proof; those who practice breath control cite the Spirit Turtle as evidence. Yet they do not realize that their true qi has silently vanished and their fetal essence has withered within. Still, they cling to rigid principles like pine and bamboo, holding fast to deluded doctrines in their writings. How pitiable! Is this not strange?

As for those who command spirits and invoke the dead, these are indeed methods within the Dao. Yet those who study them with utmost precision, exhausting the true instructions, merely chase empty reputations beyond the self and act recklessly in the world. They gain no verifiable benefit in prolonging life but prove effective in meddling with others, fabricating auspicious omens and recklessly declaring fortune and misfortune. Such people are far from the way of preserving life.

Some, embracing purity and non-action, dwell in seclusion, their forms like withered wood, their wills like dead ashes. They do not understand the heart of heaven and earth’s activity, nor observe the principles of yin and yang’s movement. Though they wander in the indistinct, their indistinctness knows no bounds; though they merge with the obscure, their obscurity remains unfathomable. Instead, beyond the subtle and imperceptible, their spiritual efficacy is lost; within the empty and white, the mysterious pass is unguarded. In their words and discussions, they may seem lofty and true. Yet sighing, one realizes: guarding the One is not the One; treading the real is not the real. This is merely the threshold to the gate, far from glimpsing the workings within the chamber.

In general, preserving qi and dwelling the spirit cannot be attained through mere stillness, nor can they be guarded through mere emptiness. The spirit has no fixed direction, yet qi is ever in motion; the body is utterly still, yet its function is boundless. Thus, in preserving qi, the essential lies in its circulation; in dwelling the spirit, the secret lies in its application.

I once heard from my teacher: ‘When the body is empty, qi circulates; when the form is still, the spirit converges.’ This is the profound mechanism of transcending the world, the great function of the nameless.”

Or else, one may ask: “If all those who practice abstention from grain achieve the power of fasting and the effect of bodily lightness, why do some still suffer depletion of qi and harm to their vitality?”

This is not due to the method itself being flawed, but rather to the reckless and haphazard manner in which practitioners apply it. If one clings to emptiness alone, qi will scatter; if one fixates on stillness, the spirit will dissipate. Only when emptiness and fullness alternate, when stillness and activity harmonize, can the true circulation of qi and the convergence of spirit be attained. Thus, the key lies not in rigid adherence to a single approach, but in adapting to the ever-shifting rhythms of the Dao.

If one merely imitates the outward forms of fasting without grasping its underlying principle, it is like a boat adrift without a rudder—though it may float for a time, it will inevitably drift into peril. The ancients said: “To fast is to return to the root; to abstain from grain is to nourish the primordial.” This is the profound truth of nurturing life.
