**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Stabilizing Primordial Flourishing Spirits**

The Most High transmitted this to the Immortal Duke of Heaven’s Eye Mountain, who cultivated the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, attaining freedom.

The Most High said: For all who seek communion with spirits, this method begins on the *yuan*-day, with subsequent practices aligned to the monthly cyclical signs.

First, inscribe the following in cinnabar on paper and swallow it; only then may the remaining text be enacted, and its numinous efficacy manifest.

**Incantation:**
*"Yellow Emperor, Grand Thearch,
Summon spirits, pursue the numinous.
Essence and qi assist me,
Divine immortals sustain my form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

Begin with five days of purification. On the *yuan*-day at the *chou* hour, take three grains of millet and place them beneath the *yuan*-person’s location. Inscribe seven cinnabar talismans on paper, burn them to ash, and dissolve the ash in a *shi* of water. Use this to:
- Wash the ears, and one may hear the speech of ghosts and spirits.
- Wash the hands and feet, and one may seize all ghosts and spirits.
- Rinse the mouth, and one may converse with ghosts.
- Drink it, and one may discern the intentions of all ghosts and spirits.

After washing on the *yuan*-day, fast until dusk, speak to no one, and avoid all animals, women, and mourners. That night, spread a clean mat in the courtyard, lie supine with the head facing south, and gaze at the Northern Dipper. By midnight, one will perceive the affairs within the Purple Tenuity Palace, hear the sounds of zithers and lutes, and witness the radiant dwelling of heaven and earth. Then recite the incantation:
*"Distant dweller, humble one,
Approach the Lord Emperor of Purple Tenuity!"*

Afterward, close the eyes and:
1. Inhale *qi* through the nose three times, visualizing celestial *qi* entering the body.
2. Inhale *qi* through the mouth three times, visualizing earthly essence entering the body.
3. Inhale through both nose and mouth three times, visualizing the spirit of humanity entering the body.

For each inhalation, hold the breath briefly before exhaling, repeating this three times. Then open the eyes and gaze at the Northern Dipper until sunrise, after which one may eat while maintaining purification.

In the second month, when the cyclical sign is *mao*, establish an altar for the lower method. Invoke the two taboo names of the Radiant Heavenly Thearch, inscribe a three-inch talisman in cinnabar, and place it in a five-colored pouch. On the *mao*-day of the second month, inscribe the Seven Stars on the altar and wear them.

**Po Jun (Breaking Army)**
*Right: Talisman of the Po Jun Star*
The Star Lord wears vermilion robes and a red headscarf, attended by twenty-five followers in red canopied chariots. To discern the rise and fall of the world, the governance of emperors, conflicts between armies, personal enmities, border foes, or one’s own military campaigns, the talisman’s wearer becomes invisible. For any matter, hold wine and dried meat, stand beneath the star, and recite the invocation— the spirit will respond within five or six phrases. Whatever task is declared aloud will summon ghostly soldiers, who obey commands. When no longer needed, remove the talisman, and they disperse. To know a ghost’s name, simply ask, and it will be revealed.

**Wu Qu (Military Brilliance)**
*Right: Talisman of the Wu Qu Star*
The Star Lord wears robes of red above and yellow below, attended by sixteen followers in red chariots with yellow canopies. To master martial arts, on the last night of the month, in seclusion, hold a bow, an arrow, and a blade, along with wine, and recite the invocation—the spirit will arrive immediately, teaching all matters before departing.

**Lian Zhen (Integrity and Chastity)**
*Right: Talisman of the Lian Zhen Star*
The Star Lord wears white robes, attended by fifteen followers in plain chariots with white canopies. Inquire about marriages, the safety of fields and dwellings, the protection of Daoist practices, the well-being of descendants, or the deceit of outsiders—all will be revealed.

**Wen Qu (Literary Brilliance)**
*Right: Talisman of the Wen Qu Star*
The Star Lord wears blue-green robes, attended by a hundred followers in blue-green canopied chariots. To foresee the future, seek longevity, or seek the numinous fungus, follow the appointed hour, offer wine and dried meat, and the spirit will guide the seeker. It also reveals forgotten ancestral tombs and interprets nightmares, omens, untimely winds and rains, falling stars, solar eclipses, strange earthly springs, solar and lunar obscurations—all may be questioned.

**Ju Men (Great Gate)**
*Right: Talisman of the Ju Men Star*
The Star Lord wears yellow robes, attended by fifty followers in yellow canopied chariots.

Should you seek to assist kings, marquises, or governors of commanderies, evade the pressing threats of misfortune or illness, or resolve the frustration of unanswered official aspirations, inquire in the manner described above. For all scholarly doubts, uncertainties in medicinal substances, or lacunae in texts, pose your questions likewise. Carry the talisman with you, and even the celestial ministers of highest rank, or matters concerning beloved sons and daughters, may be addressed.

**Lu Cun (Wealth Repository)**
*Right: Talisman of the Lu Cun Star*
The Star Lord wears robes of deep blue above and white below, attended by twenty followers in chariots with white canopies. Should you seek profit in commerce, hidden treasures, or a son for a barren woman; should you wish to recover lost servants or property; inquire of the duration of floods or droughts in the year, the span of human life, the recovery of the ill, the success or failure of official pursuits, or disputes with others—carry the talisman with you, and kings and lords will hold you in esteem, while men and women alike will submit to your will. Place the talisman upon your head, and you will become invisible. Secure it beneath your feet, and you will neither drown in water nor burn in fire, nor be harmed by blades or weapons—its efficacy remains as before.

**Tan Lang (Greedy Wolf)**
*Right: Talisman of the Tan Lang Star*
The Star Lord wears black robes, attended by eighty-one followers in chariots with black canopies, all bearing swords at their waists, striking fear into those who behold them. Should you intend to act with malice, oppress others’ sons and daughters, seek vengeance for grievances, or undertake any perilous or wicked deeds, inquire in the manner described above. Inscribe a name beneath the talisman, secretly bury it before a gate, and at night, the cries of ghosts and spirits will cease only when it is removed. Place the inscribed name upon a rooftop for three days, and wild beasts, monstrous birds, and all manner of vicious creatures will gather beneath the dwelling—within ten days, the household will be destroyed, and only the removal of the talisman will halt the calamity. Bury the talisman beneath a turtle’s belly for five days, and even the most skilled physicians will fail to cure the afflicted—only its removal will restore health. Place the talisman in your mouth, and legal disputes will dissolve in your favor.

The seven star talismans are to be inscribed in cinnabar upon paper, each three inches square. To summon the spirits or employ the talismans for other purposes, follow the dictates of your heart. For those born in the Lower Yuan who suffer from grave and unyielding illnesses, offer wine in sacrifice, then inquire of the spirits regarding fortune or misfortune. If the skies are clear, the spirits will manifest at once—do not fear. The talismans serve other purposes as well; inscribe them as the text prescribes, and after the sacrifice, the spirits will appear. Bow in reverence if they manifest, but do not bow if they do not.

Should the Purple Tenuity, the Celestial Thearch of the North Culmen, appear—whose attire is ever-changing and whose retinue numbers in the thousands—do not inquire lightly. If you seek to erase your name from the ledgers of death and inscribe it among the living, you must dwell in the mountains, abstain from the five grains, renounce all desires, forsake glory and splendor, shun clamor, abandon sensual pleasures, and contemplate the Dao while distancing yourself from the dust of the world. Only then may you receive and uphold this talisman, gaining admittance to the presence of the Celestial Thearch. Inscribe it in cinnabar upon white silk, three inches square, and swallow one talisman each day for thirty-six days. Close your eyes and meditate upon the True Unity, and your intestines will transform into gold, your bones into silver, your merit equaling that of the Celestial Thearch. With prolonged practice, you will attain spiritual transformation and freedom, capable of all things—riding cranes and mounting dragons, bound by no constraints, commanding ghosts and spirits, and attaining a lifespan coeval with heaven and earth.

The Most High said: This is the root of all practices, the Way of summoning spirits. For Daoist adepts, attaining divine transcendence and sagehood is no longer difficult. For those unable to dwell in the mountains but who possess this text, inscribe it in cinnabar upon yellow silk, five inches square, and write your name and birth month beneath the talisman. Place it in a five-colored pouch, securing it upon your head or within your collar. Your official aspirations will be fulfilled, wealth and resources will abound, evil paths will recede, and your person will be cherished, while all people will hold you in reverence. To receive this talisman, ascend the altar and inscribe it in cinnabar, three inches square. For all talismans inscribed in cinnabar, arrange eight lamps upon the altar, eight vessels of fragrant oil in the eight directions, four blades, and construct four stairways. The talismans, like the seven stars, should be spaced one foot and two inches apart, with the Po Jun talisman aligned with the lunar station of the month, placed at the center of the Purple Tenuity altar. Beneath each talisman, place a sheet of white paper and a cloth twelve feet long as a seat. Arrange five cups of wine, seven dishes of dried meat, four censers of incense and fire, and vessels of varied colors. The altar should stand four feet high, with four stairways, and its adornments should be meticulously arranged. Stand facing north or south upon the altar, using a wooden tablet inscribed with the memorial text.

The altar may be erected in a courtyard or an empty dwelling, provided it is a secluded and pristine place, free from defilement. On the first day of the month, at the appointed hour, the Orthodox Unity disciple, your humble servant [Name], respectfully invokes the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the August Thearch, and the Most High Lord of the Great Ultimate: Your servant, dull-witted and blind of heart, knows nothing of the Great Dao, and in this benighted age, lacks a wise teacher. I dare to humble the celestial majesty and beseech your presence upon this seat. Bowing twice, may the Seven Star Lords simultaneously take their places upon the altar, their forms clearly visible—do not fear. Address them again, saying: Your servant, of stubborn and ignorant nature, has vainly received the teachings of the Dao. Bearing the weight of heaven and treading the earth, my aspiration is for long life. I further wish to know the past and future, all matters of fortune and misfortune. I desire to study and master martial arts, to unite or separate husband and wife, and to seek wealth and property. I wish to inquire about and dispel all inauspicious events, ensuring that all is auspicious. May my requests be granted, my undertakings accomplished, my talismans efficacious, my pursuit of the Dao lead to transcendence, and my livelihood be prosperous and smooth. After this, may heaven take pity and grant your servant’s humble wishes.

Conclude the ritual by offering incense and sending off the spirits. During regular offerings, the Seven Stars will descend to their seats, manifesting in the heavens. The Purple Tenuity may appear to the practitioner, but no separate sacrifice is required. Upon completion, consume the wine yourself, ensuring it is finished. If it cannot be consumed, bury it. Discard all vessels and implements in flowing water to the east, burn the memorial tablet, and swallow the talisman. Sweep and dismantle the altar, resuming your usual attire without any taboos. For future uncertainties, inquire in the manner described above. Should you wish to study the Purple Tenuity, follow the instructions as written.

The Most High said: For this text, the ritual should be performed on a clear, cloudless, and windless day, preferably the *mao* day of the second month. If the skies are overcast, postpone until the *chen* day of the third month, or the fourth month if necessary.

After one hundred days of practice, adding a fast is especially beneficial. If one can constantly maintain mindfulness, the deities will frequently manifest and offer repeated guidance. Begin with the initial establishment, placing the Breaking Army talisman according to the monthly cyclical sign. Follow the method on the *mao* day of the second month. All rituals require wine and dried meat. Focus your thoughts on the deity’s name, visualize the star to which you belong, and make separate offerings to it. In times of peril, your governing star will come to your aid wherever you are.

All talismans should be inscribed on the first day of the first month, with subsequent petitions made according to the lunar cycle. Perform the writing at cock’s crow, lighting three lamps beneath the Northern Culmen. Use well water and cinnabar to inscribe the talisman. Before writing, stand facing north and invoke: *"This humble disciple [name] respectfully invokes the Most High Lord Lao, Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, the Northern Culmen, and the Northern Dipper."* If inscribing talismans for ritual methods, address the Seven Stars as *"Venerable Deities of the Seven Stars."* Otherwise, invoke the star deity corresponding to your request, stating: *"Pure and faithful disciple of [age], from [place of origin], now receives the True Imperial Numinous Talisman of the Most High Lord Lao. May the numinous talisman and its venerable deities come to assist this disciple [name], granting all wishes and fulfilling every desire."* After the invocation, bow twice, then sit facing north to inscribe the talisman.

During the process, regulate your *qi* by holding the breath without allowing it to rush. Exhale gently through the nose, moving the *qi* subtly. When lowering the brush, hold the breath; when lifting it, exhale to avoid headaches.

All people, regardless of status or age, are governed by the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper. Note the star lord to which you belong. In times of urgent distress, call upon its name, saying, *"Save me, aid me!"* Repeat three times, bowing three times, and the star will come to your rescue. If you do not recall your governing star, invoke the names of all Seven Stars, and they will deliver and protect you. This is the great essential of the celestial Dao.

Those born in the *zi* year belong to Greedy Wolf, the Numinous Spirit Child.
Those born in the *chou* or *hai* year belong to Great Gate, the Upright Literary Child.
Those born in the *yin* or *xu* year belong to Wealth Repository, the Guardian Mansion Child.
Those born in the *mao* or *you* year belong to Literary Curvature, the Worldly Benevolence Child.
Those born in the *chen* or *shen* year belong to Integrity and Chastity, the Balanced Child.
Those born in the *si* or *wei* year belong to Martial Curvature, the Grand Chariot Child.
Those born in the *wu* year belong to Breaking Army, the Grand Guest Child.

In times of urgent peril or distress, perform the Yu step three times beneath the Northern Dipper and call upon the name of your governing star to come to your rescue.

The *Three Jia Jade Strategies* of the Most High supplements the preceding missing text and is recorded in the *Secret Methods of the Supreme Clarity*. Be sure to consult it.

The **Disease-Dispelling Spirit Talisman** can be used for all sudden illnesses, red eyes, malignant swellings, and nail-like sores. Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar and wear it on the head or neck to immediately dispel the affliction upon leaving the patient’s home. Upon seeing the spirit, offer incense cakes and food as a sacrifice, omitting wine and meat. The spirit appears as a woman dressed in black, holding a curved oar, riding a donkey. Her surname is Zhuan (or Cao, according to another version). Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar at the onset of illness, and the affliction will be cured instantly. If the illness recurs, write the patient’s name in ink on blue silk and burn it in the stove to reactivate the ailment. To cure it again, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar for immediate healing.

**Incantation:**
*"I invoke the Messenger of the Northern Lord. May you ride forth and descend to this seat. I beseech you to release the illness, and may no fault be found in this plea. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

The **Celestial Strategy Talisman**
This spirit is an emissary of the Celestial Emperor, surnamed Shuke Si. It traverses the world in flight, knowing all matters of fortune and misfortune before they occur. The spirit resembles an immortal, clad in celestial robes, wearing a floral crown, riding clouds, and capable of summoning wind, rain, and abundant harvests. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on a blue silk pouch and affix it over the heart on the front of your garment. When the Strategy Spirit appears, inquire of it, and it will reveal all matters of fortune and misfortune. Do not inscribe this talisman more than once.

**Incantation:**
*"The Sun is my father, the Moon my mother. The Five Stars are my siblings, the Great One my friend. I wield the Celestial Strategy Spirit Talisman to subdue and command all spirits and ghosts. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

The **Spirit-Summoning Talisman**
This talisman governs the gathering of all spirits and ghosts. Inscribe it in cinnabar on a three-inch square of paper, roll it tightly, and conceal it in the doorways, walls, or crevices of a household—ensuring no one sees it. Before the master arrives to sit, all household members, including relatives, elders, door spirits, household guardians, and stove deities, will appear before you. Inquire about matters of fortune and misfortune, and they will report the names of ghosts from past generations, one by one. Retrieve the talisman, and the spirits and ghosts will disperse.

The **Wilderness Talisman**
Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on paper. If a tomb is lost, write the deceased’s name on the talisman and place it beneath your feet. Recite the incantation: *"O profound, come forth to my talisman’s command. Swiftly, swiftly, command the breath to cease!"* Soon, the ghost will appear. Follow it to locate the tomb, which will be verified as accurate.

The **Thief-Binding Talisman**
The spirit of this talisman is surnamed Quan. It can assume human form but has donkey-like ears, no mouth, moves on its knees, has a tail, wears black clothing, and is malevolent—killing when angered. To bind a thief or oneself, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on paper, drawing a person beneath it, and swallow it. On the night of a theft, spit water beneath the Northern Dipper and recite the incantation:

*"The Azure Emperor of the East is the Azure Dragon—swiftly bind the thief and deliver them to my side!
The Vermilion Emperor of the South is the Vermilion Dragon—swiftly bind the thief and deliver them to my side!
The White Emperor of the West is the White Dragon—swiftly bind the thief and deliver them to my side!
The Black Emperor of the North is the Black Dragon—swiftly bind the thief and deliver them to my side!
The Yellow Emperor of the Center is the Yellow Dragon—swiftly bind the thief and deliver them to my side!
I command the Celestial Strategy Spirit Talisman to dispatch you and all spirits. If you disobey and defy me, I will bind and destroy you!
I spit the spirit water eastward—rivers run dry!
I spit southward—fires extinguish!
I spit westward—metal shatters!
I spit northward—mountains split!
I spit upward—heaven’s pillars break!
I spit downward—earth’s gates open!
Spit once to bind a thief, and ten thousand thieves will be eradicated!"*

"Bind swiftly, bind swiftly!
By tomorrow, the thief shall stand at your door, holding the stolen goods.
When the master commands departure, set them down and they shall leave—spit the water and they are gone.
This was once greatly verified by Dongfang Shuo.

**Spirit-Warding Talisman**
The talisman on the right governs hidden and arising spirits. Take a peach branch from the east, split it open to a length of three inches, inscribe one piece in cinnabar, then bind the two pieces together with seven wraps. Place it upon the person’s rooftop, and that very night, the cries of doves and the howls of foxes shall be heard—whereupon the spirit will ascend to the rooftop. Remove the talisman, and it shall disperse.

In ancient times, the Most High received this from the Purple Tenuity Lady of the Supreme Sovereign. Those in later generations who receive and uphold it shall ascend upon clouds by day and befriend the host of immortals.

For talismans ensuring victory in games of chance, adjust the size of the paper as needed, inscribe in cinnabar as before, and place beneath the foot—left for men, right for women. This has been greatly verified.

The **Laozi Mountain-Entering Talisman**, inscribed in cinnabar on plain silk and worn, allows one to traverse the world unobstructed. If a true person wears it for a full year, they may enter the mountains, and no spectral ghost shall dare approach.

The **Wood-Dissolving Talisman**, inscribed in cinnabar on paper on a *jiazi* day and consumed, transforms the body. Lie facing due east, embracing a bamboo staff until death; after one day, rise and depart, leaving behind your headwrap and sleeping mat. Your body shall have already gone—do not look back, but travel far to another land.

Wear the talisman when meeting officials, and none of high or noble rank shall fail to rise and greet you.

The **Life-Governing Talisman**, three inches of silk inscribed in cinnabar and worn over the heart with reverence, has been greatly verified.

For the **Distant Journey Talisman**, inscribe the name and surname of the seeker beneath the left foot.

The **Wealth-Governing Talisman** for endless prosperity: inscribe in cinnabar on plain silk and place within the collar—greatly auspicious.

For cinnabar-inscribed talismans, avoid defilement and conceal them from others. They should be three inches and eight fen in length, eight fen in width.

For true persons entering mountains to gather herbs, longer talismans are superior. On a wooden board one foot and two inches long, inscribe the **Mountain Summons Talisman** and carry it while traveling. You shall surely be welcomed by divine beings, and no hundred ghosts or spirits shall dare approach—mountain spirits shall bow. Affix this talisman to the door of a mountain dwelling, centered on the upper beam, and none shall fail to avoid it.

For all methods of reception:
- In the first month, the *jianyin* day;
- In the second month, the *mao* day.
On the first day of the first month, second day of the second month, third day of the third month, fifth day of the fifth month, seventh day of the seventh month, and ninth day of the ninth month at the *xu* hour, prepare:
- A bowl of water,
- A clean knife laid across the bowl,
- An incense burner,
- A clean mat,
- A secluded chamber, free of impurities, where no one may see—only those of like mind may witness.

Stand upon the mat, first pay homage to the four directions, beginning with the east. After bowing, light the incense. Then wash hands and face with the water, and spray it toward the five directions. Face east and inhale seven times, saying:
*"Eastern blue qi, enter my mouth."*
Repeat for the other three directions. Bow again to the four directions, then perform the **Yu Step**, circling left. Turn from south to north, head following the feet. Open the Gate of Heaven with the mouth, close the Gate of Earth with the feet together, and raise the Pillar of Heaven with the tongue pressed upward.

Form the **Du Jian Hand Seal**: with the left thumb, press the base of the left palm.

While practicing, maintain purity—abstain from meat, pungent vegetables, *yuntai*, places of mourning, and defiled areas where women have given birth. If encountered, perform ablutions immediately. Only after completing the divine incantations shall nothing be lost.

After completing the Yu Step, sit, rinse the mouth with water, strike the Heavenly Drum three times, swallow the qi, and hold fresh water in the mouth—speak not a word.

To gather qi, pause the brush and perform the Yu Step, reciting the incantation:
*"All others are turbid, I alone am clear.
All others depart, I alone remain.
All others break, I alone endure.
Heaven unfolds, earth divides—I stand with them as one.
I summon Wen Chang, roam the Heart Star.
Ascend the Mystic Pivot, refine myself in Integrity.
Feast on sweet essence, embody the sun and moon.
Ride in peace upon the Three Phoenixes’ chariot.
Conceal the feathered canopy, hide beneath the flowery cover.
In the Jade Hall of the Nine Heavens, play beneath the cinnabar canopy.
Green Dragon and White Tiger attend my side.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"*

**True Qi-Receiving Talisman**"

**Pass-Through-Eyes Talisman, Heavenly Armor Talisman, Earthly Armor Talisman, Human Armor Talisman**

The *Tai Shang Three Armor Jade Strategy Talismans*—though slightly variant from the previous version—are inscribed here anew: the *True Qi-Receiving Talisman*, *Pass-Through-Eyes Talisman*, *Heavenly Armor Talisman*, *Earthly Armor Talisman*, and *Human Armor Talisman*.

**Spirit-Summoning Talisman**
In other manuals, a *Spirit-Summoning Talisman* exists, but its authenticity is doubtful, its beginning and end disordered. Thus, it was not transcribed, for transmission remains incomplete. Some masters, out of self-interest, refuse to teach their disciples. Some disciples, harboring malice, fail to grasp the full method. Uncertain of these two matters, I now record the *Spirit-Summoning Talisman*.

On a *geng* or *xin* day, inscribe this talisman upon a three-inch peachwood tablet, then bury it facing the *zi* direction. The spirit will manifest, speak with you, and fulfill your desires.

**Black. White.**
*The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Honorable and Efficacious Spirit* concludes.
