**The Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Numinous Seal**

The Numinous Seal
The Ghost-Subduing Seal
The Ghost-Commanding Seal
The Ghost-Summoning Seal

Laozi said: This Mysterious Numinous Seal is the root of all methods and the myriad arts. Without this method, all Daoist arts are practiced in vain and cannot succeed. Though various methods speak of their efficacy, without the Mysterious Numinous Seal, one labors in futility, exhausting effort to no avail.

Laozi said: If one wishes to command ghostly soldiers, first gather the following:
- Three *liang* of red kudzu flowers (which are white calamus flowers),
- One *jin* of wolfberry fruit, gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month,
- Three *jin* of red mulberry bark, white and fertile from the earth,
- Three *liang* each of *guijiu* (ghost’s fault), buffalo tallow, and *guijian* (ghost’s arrow).

Dry these six ingredients in the shade for twenty days, then grind them into a fine powder and mix with honey to form pills the size of small beans. Take three pills at the *yin* hour (3–5 a.m.), and three doses of the powder daily. After seven days, all the Eight Historians, Six Ding Jade Maidens, mountain spirits, river lords, water officials, earth deities, thunder lords, all *rakṣasas* of rivers and seas, *Wangjiu Panjin*, the eight classes of ghosts and spirits, and the commanders of the world’s million ghosts and gods will bow in submission and come to pay homage. All tigers, wolves, birds, and beasts will be at your command.

Lord Lao said: All the myriad methods derive from this Mysterious Numinous Seal. Each speaks of its powers, yet without seeking food or drink. Though external methods may possess talismans, seals, incantations, and techniques, if they lack this Mysterious Numinous Seal, all effort is wasted, and not one in ten thousand will succeed.

Laozi said: Having received the oral transmission of the Numinous Treasure Mysterious Numinous Seal from the Supreme Lord, if one holds it according to the method, on the third day of the third month, one’s body may transform into ten thousand forms. Instantly, water and fire, gold, silver, treasures, and jade, all the world’s vegetables, trees, rivers, seas, earth, stones, wind, and rain, and even the transformations of birds and beasts—all will manifest without exception. If one wishes to attain the aforementioned powers, one must purify the body, maintain cleanliness, and abstain from all blood foods. By upholding such pure precepts, not one in ten thousand will fail.

Laozi said: To employ the Eight Historians and Six Ding to obtain gold, silver, all treasures, and immortal medicines for a person, first perform the Eight Historians’ Mysterious Numinous Talisman and Seal. Direct the seal toward the eastern *Zhen* (Thunder) direction of the earth, and the Eight Historians will instantly procure all requested items. Then, turn the Six Ding’s horizontal seal toward the heavens, and the Eight Historians and Six Ding, leading their ghostly soldiers, will all assemble before the method.

Laozi said: This method is most secret; do not transmit it to others. If one violates the true regulations, calamity will extend to seven generations of descendants.

The seal’s dimensions are as follows: two *cun* in width, with a core of white sandalwood. Carve the left seal first—this seal is to be engraved as described above, and its efficacy will be no different. The left seal is the rear seal, and the right seal is the front seal. Use them to command the Eight Historians, Six Ding Jade Maidens, and the ghosts and gods of the world. Engrave the front seal to a depth of one *cun* in water on the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month—these are the days when the Eight Historians of the heavens descend, and all ghosts and spirits are among people, observing their virtues and transgressions. Engraving the seal on these days ensures immediate success. Engrave the rear seal on the same days to send flying talismans a thousand *li*, arriving instantly.

This seal is secret; do not transmit it recklessly. To engrave it, first enter a purified chamber and sprinkle the ground with a decoction of spikenard. Use an ancient knife to carve the seal. At the *yin* hour, enter the chamber, burn incense, and invoke the former master Laozi, the Eight Historians, and the Six Ding Jade Maidens. After three invocations, begin carving. Complete the engraving by the *mao* hour (5–7 a.m.), ensuring it is not delayed past this time. Wear new clothes, bathe in fragrant water to purify the body, and carve while reciting the *qi* sixty-four times (eight times eight). Do not omit any *qi*. After carving, bury the seal in a ghostly place for twenty days, then retrieve it at the *yin* hour of dawn. Set up an altar according to the method and uphold it for twenty-one days—success will be assured.

The altar should be eight *chi* wide, with eight lamps, one bronze basin, four incense burners, four incense tables, five-colored silks for the five directions, one mirror, one cup of wine, one *jin* of dried venison, and one plate of five vegetables. Erect the altar on the first day of the first month, and it will be complete in three days. Use sesame oil for the lamps, not fresh oil. Place four lamps at the four corners, which must not be extinguished at night. The four inner lamps may be extinguished at dawn, while the four outer lamps remain to correspond to the four directions and four seasons. The four inner lamps are for the Eight Historians, who sit on round mats, and the Six Ding, who correspond to the four seasons. The eight lamps together correspond to the Eight Historians above and the eight trigrams below. The Eight Historians lead all the kings and assemble here; no other incense is permitted.

Erecting the altar brings ten kinds of karmic rewards. Those who see these lamps will enjoy lifelong longevity and ultimate vitality. All treasures and desired objects will be obtained at will. To describe the altar’s merits would be inexhaustible; thus, no more is said. Do not transmit this.

Laozi said: When using the seal, recite the incantation over it three times, saying:
*"The true qi of the Supreme Lord illumines my body.
What the seal transforms is instantly accomplished.
The Eight Historians guard the left; the Six Ding attend my form.
All ghosts and gods of the world come to serve the numinous.
With one press of the divine seal, ghosts and soldiers are commanded.
I, your servant, seek the Dao, eternal life through the ages.
Ascending to heaven in broad daylight, soaring to the Upper Clarity."*

After reciting the incantation, take the seal in your left hand and raise it toward the heavens. The Eight Historians of the heavens will all come and stand before you. Ask what you desire, and they will immediately procure it for you.

If transforming mountains, forests, rivers, or seas, grasp the seal and shake your body three times—then the person shall instantly become a wooded mountain or hill. To reverse this, hold the seal upright toward the heavens, and they shall return to human form. If transforming into a river, coat the seal with ink, place it upon your head, and shake your hand three times—it shall become a great river, its waters spanning a hundred *li*. To halt this, lower the seal and sit, and it shall cease. To command the Six Ding and Jade Maidens, along with all ghosts and spirits, coat the seal with realgar and cinnabar—then all ghosts, spirits, and the Six Ding shall come, ready to be dispatched at your will, moving mountains, drying seas, summoning thunder and lightning, darkening heaven and earth, causing the sun and moon to fall, or conjuring clouds and rain. This Numinous Seal can perform all these tasks for you.

To dispatch the Six Ding to move mountains and dry seas, coat the seal with cinnabar and direct it toward them—it shall become mulberry fields. Hold the seal horizontally toward the west, and the mountains shall shift into level plains. To halt this, hold the seal upright toward the east, and the mountains shall return to their original form. To summon thunder, raise the seal in your left hand toward the east—it shall become thunder, shaking heaven and earth. To darken the sun and moon, conjure clouds, or summon rain, use the seal to call the Eight Historians, and they shall bring forth clouds and rain. To obscure the light of the sun and moon or create a white mist, use the seal to summon the Six Ding, and they shall comply.

Laozi said: To extend your years, attain longevity, and seek immortality or flight as an immortal, coat the seal with red *ge* blossoms twenty-one times—the Eight Historians and Six Ding shall come to support and escort you to heaven, enabling you to ride the void, traverse the Five Peaks, and conceal yourself ten thousand times over. The immortal officials of the Five Peaks, celestial deities, Jade Boys, and Jade Maidens shall all come to welcome you. First, contract the earth’s veins to travel, traversing all directions of the world, and afterward, seek immortality and attain it.

Laozi said: To contract the earth’s veins, mix realgar with cinnabar and coat the seal, then direct it toward the eastern spirits. *Aṭa* shall lead all divine soldiers to contract the land by a thousand *li*, or even a hundred thousand *li*, so that the distance is covered in the time it takes to eat a single mouthful of food. To journey to Mount Penglai and meet the immortals, coat the seal with two *zhū* of mercury and true cinnabar—the Eight Historians of the east shall lead the great Five Divisions of ghostly soldiers to contract the earth’s veins for you, instantly arriving at Mount Penglai, where immortal men and Jade Maidens riding green dragons and white tigers shall come to welcome you. When you meet them, hold the seal horizontally toward the immortals, and they shall instantly transform into ten thousand lions. Seeing this, the immortals shall all gasp in awe and appoint you as an immortal, inscribing your name in the Golden Gates and Purple Chambers of the Great Mountain, granting you eternal life, coeval with heaven and earth. Those who seek this method must not harm any spirits.

Laozi said: To dispatch the Six Ding and Eight Historians to retrieve treasures, direct the seal toward the heavens—the Eight Historians and divine maidens shall immediately bring forth all manner of gold and treasures. Bury three *liang* at the earth’s gate, and the rest may be used as you wish. To conceal your form or transform, direct the seal toward your face to become an old man, toward your heart to become a woman, toward your feet to become earth, or toward your back to become the heavens, with thunder and lightning shaking the skies. Hold the seal in your left hand, inverted toward the heavens, and rain shall fall; to halt it, hold the seal upright toward the earth, and it shall cease.

To transform into grasses and trees, gather a hundred flowers on the fifth day of the fifth month, dry them in the shade for twenty days, grind them into powder, and coat the seal. Press the seal to the ground, and the person shall transform into a hundred grasses. Shake the seal left and right, and they shall instantly become a thousand people; to halt this, reverse the seal toward yourself, and they shall cease. To summon all manner of beasts—lions, tigers, wolves, jiao-dragons, or venomous serpents—hold the seal horizontally toward the ground, and it shall become a thousand great venomous serpents, each ten *zhang* in length. To halt this, press the seal to the ground, and the tigers, wolves, jiao-dragons, and serpents shall vanish at once.

Laozi said: This Numinous Seal must be received after establishing an altar for twenty-one days; no register is required. If you obtain this seal and the Eight Perfected Numinous Seal, follow these methods without fail. Originally, there was no register for the Eight Historians. In the first year of *Yongshou*, a divine master observed the Eight Historians conversing in the void and thus composed a volume on the Eight Historians’ offerings, later compiling six additional volumes. Those who possess this true foundation need not receive registers; without it, one must first receive the register before the offerings may descend. Long ago, Master Guigu and Fei Changfang practiced these methods and attained immortality. In the third year of *Yonghe* of the Jin dynasty, when the *taisu* was in the north, they transmitted it to Master Zhuge, and from then on, few have obtained this method. A set of fifty volumes, compiled by Master Zhuge into a single volume titled *The Numinous Book of Ghostly Command*, was left for later generations.

To command ghosts, on a *gui* day of the Six Ding, gather ghost’s mushroom and three *liang* of white bark from a red mulberry. On the seventh day of the seventh month, bury them at the ghost’s gate. After twenty-one days, at dusk, take three steps and nine footprints, knock your teeth three times, and recite the incantation three times. Apply the medicine to your eyes, and all ghosts and spirits shall obey your commands like servants, retrieving gold, silver, and immortal medicines for you to consume and attain flight as an immortal. These ghosts constantly seek to kill, but if you hold a pill of the aforementioned medicine in your mouth, they shall not dare harm you.

To dispatch ghosts and spirits to steal gold, silver, or valuables from others, first make an offering to the ghosts. Use three cups of wine, three dried fish, three *jin* of deer jerky, five fruits, and an incense burner for the offering. Pray thus: *"I make you my friend and constantly feed you wine and jerky. If I command you to retrieve gold, jade, money, or valuables, bring them at once, and do not disobey my words. If I seek the Dao and immortality, send me to attain it, and retrieve all things under heaven immediately—do not disobey my words. Once all gold, jade, money, and valuables are obtained, they shall supply your needs endlessly."* Guard this secret and do not recklessly transmit it to others.

This talisman is the Ghost-Summoning Talisman. Write it in cinnabar on a two-*cun* piece of white silk, place it in a five-colored bag, and carry it with you. Do not let others see it.

If you wish to command ghosts and spirits, hold the talisman pouch in your left hand and point toward the four directions—all ghosts, by the hundreds of thousands, will come and gather before you. Then speak to the ghostly soldiers, saying: *"What do you wish to retrieve for me?"* The ghosts will obey your every command. Whether you seek elixirs of immortality or all manner of gold and treasures, they will fetch whatever you desire, supplying endless provisions for your use. If there are those who commit evil or cause harm, summon the ghosts to exact retribution: bid them kill, and they will kill; bid them spare, and they will spare. If they refuse to kill, let them suffer torment in their own bodies, unable to live yet unable to die. For all grievances, wrongs, or enmities, dispatch the ghostly soldiers to avenge you—bid them kill, and they will kill; bid them spare, and they will spare.

Zhuge says: If you wish to use ghosts to summon a person from a thousand *li* away, write their name within the talisman, hold it in your hand, and shake it three times—the person will arrive within a day. When commanding ghosts and spirits, first invoke the names of the Five Directions’ Ghost Marshals:

The Ghost Marshal of the East is named Azhajia, leading a host of a million lesser ghosts.
The Ghost Marshal of the South is named Fu, also called Baosha, leading three million lesser ghosts.
The Ghost Marshal of the West is named Fuqiu, leading three million lesser ghosts.
The Ghost Marshal of the North is named Shenzha, leading a million lesser ghosts.

Zhuge says: When using ghosts and spirits to retrieve objects, they will arrive as soon as you express your intent—first invoke the Five Directions, and the Ghost Marshals will lead their hosts to fetch them at once. These Ghost Marshals inspect human transgressions day and night. They observe people once at sunrise, departing shortly after, then return at noon to examine them again, and once more at midnight. During these three times, do not sleep or lie down, for the Five Divisions of Ghosts greatly fear these moments and may slay people—beware of this. If you hold the medicinal talisman in hand when the hour arrives, they cannot harm you. When speaking with others, keep secret matters confidential, and if you show them gold, silver, or treasures, the ghosts will retrieve them immediately.

Zhuge says: If you wish to transform beans into soldiers, take one thousand red beans and coat them twenty-one times with a mixture of sheep’s blood and ox gallstone. When ready to use them, recite this incantation over the beans:

*"These beans are the soldiers of ghosts and spirits,
I am the son of the Heavenly Emperor.
Commanding transformations at my will,
they follow my every decree.
To fell mountains and hew forests,
wealth and honor shall flourish like a marketplace.
Prolonging life without end,
boundless as heaven and earth.
Hasten! As the law commands."*

After reciting, take the beans in your left hand and shake your right hand toward the northern *Kan* earth, summoning the ghosts from afar. Shake thrice toward the northern *Kan* earth, and the Ghost Marshals and divine generals will lead their ghostly hosts, transforming into bean soldiers to shake the mountains and valleys. Should you desire a multitude of tens of millions, they will manifest instantly, as if living men. When deploying bean soldiers to hew forests and fell mountains, all manner of tasks can be accomplished with the previous incantation. With bean soldiers felling trees and clearing mountains, by dawn a thousand or ten thousand *qing* of land may be cleared. To recall them, use the Ghost-Subduing Talisman, and all will return at once, standing before you. This method is secret—do not let others see it.

This is the Ghost-Subduing Talisman. To activate it, write with sheep’s blood, ox gallstone, and the Four *Qi*. Once used, ensure nothing is lacking, for any deficiency will render it ineffective. If you wish to send this talisman flying hundreds or thousands of *li*, mix human blood with sheep’s blood, inscribe the name within the talisman, and it will fly off on its own. If someone comes seeking aid, there is no need to write a talisman—simply recite the incantation thrice:

*"Spirits of heaven and earth, radiance of sun and moon,
I dispatch this flying talisman, commanding the Six *Ding*.
As I voice my desire,
drive forth the ghostly soldiers.
Hasten! As the law commands."*

After reciting, click your teeth thrice and press the Spirit-Communing Seal seven times, and the talisman will fly away. If you wish to use the talisman to summon thieves or bandits, recite the incantation thrice and seal it thrice, and it will fly to slay the brigands. If you kill them, you may then use the talisman to capture their names and speak to them.

Zhuge says: To deploy spirit soldiers, take one *sheng* of millet, coat it three to seven times with a mixture of pig’s blood and black ox blood, and recite the bean soldier incantation thrice—ghostly soldiers will instantly fill the mountains and rivers. To recall them, use the Ghost-Subduing Talisman, hold it in your mouth, and call out, and they will halt at once.

If one can command the *Jiupanji* ghosts and *Rākṣasa* demons, they may perform wondrous transformations for all beings under heaven. The method to summon them: press the left and right Spirit-Communing Seals upon your fingers, and the *Jiupanji* ghosts and *Rākṣasa* demons will arrive instantly, transforming into colossal venomous serpents three hundred *zhang* in length, with maws a *zhang* wide, to terrify and slay men. To halt them, firmly press the seal, and they will vanish. Keep this secret—do not transmit it.

Master Zhuge said: The Lao Lord’s Ghost-Directing Talisman can command the Earth Lord, River Earl, and Water Officials, enabling one to see hidden treasures—gold, jade, and precious objects—across a thousand *li*, all appearing clearly before the eyes. The method for this talisman also allows the summoning of the Turtle Lord. Keep this secret.

This is the talisman for directing the River Earl, Water Officials, Earth Lord, and Turtle Lord. For the method of command: mix magpie-head blood with sulfur and write with it, then fashion robes of five colors to complete it. Hold it in the left hand and place it upon the head to become invisible; lowering the talisman halts the effect. Place it upon the face, and it transforms into fifteen youths. Fasten it at the waist, and it becomes a woman of unmatched beauty. Place it at the feet, and it becomes an old man with white hair, claiming to be over a hundred years old. Grasp the talisman in the right hand, shake it thrice, advance two steps, then retreat three steps, and it scatters into a thousand people. To halt, run toward a person’s gate, hold the talisman aloft, and point it to the heavens—it will revert to a single form.

Master Zhuge said: This talisman may be employed at will. Write it in cinnabar upon white silk, then use the aforementioned Ghost-Subduing Talisman, recite the incantation thrice, and strike the talisman’s right ear—eighteen women of peerless beauty will instantly appear; reversing the talisman halts them. When the talisman is brought beneath a tree, all birds and sparrows gather; reversing the talisman disperses them. Cast it into water, and all dragons, fish, and turtles assemble without harm; reversing the talisman halts them.
