*Scripture Title:* *The Secret Formulae of the Sacred Embryo’s Divine Applications*
*Author:* Unknown
*Volume:* One
*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section on Methods of the Cavernous Divine*

The Master said: "One who knows the supreme Dao is not slain by Heaven; one who ingests primordial qi is not extinguished by Earth."

The supreme Dao is not distant—it resides within one’s own body. Through refined and subtle application of the mind, life endures.

*The Secret Principles of Master Liu* states: "To attain longevity, cultivate the root of one’s existence." It begins with essence and qi. Essence and qi coalesce to form the body; the body is the foundation that receives qi, and qi is the root of the formed. Primordial qi is the origin from which form is endowed—thus may the principle of formed existence be discerned.

The Scripture says: "Deeply root and firmly stem—this is the Dao of long life and enduring vision." It further says: "Within the form, mother and child—why not guard them?" Within the form, primordial qi is the mother, and spirit is the child. Initially, through the qi of inhalation and exhalation, the form is established—hence it is called mother. Once form and qi are established, the inherent spirit arises—hence it is called child.

The supreme spirit, united with qi and form, circulates within the viscera, governing breath above and below. With prolonged practice, the spirit naturally clarifies, and qi naturally harmonizes. When the spirit is inwardly luminous, it illumines the five viscera; when qi is harmonized, it empowers the four limbs.

Thus, the Yellow Emperor, through three months of inward vision, stabilized the mind with spirit, thereby transforming and nurturing the five viscera. This principle may be inferred and attained!

It further says: "Within intent, movement and stillness—qi attains spirit’s penetration. Practicing the Dao with self-mastery, my spirit shines brightly." This truth, too, may be inferred and attained.

Yet people of this age allow spirit and qi to move separately, mother and child to drift apart. Though qi breathes within, the spirit constantly engages externals. Thus, qi lacks a master, and spirit is obstructed; when spirit is obstructed, essence scatters.

Moreover, spirit is the master, and form is the dwelling. If the master does not tend within but daily labors without, the dwelling naturally becomes empty, and the body decays.

Alas, in this degenerate age, within each day and night—across the hundred divisions of time—the body’s qi completes thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, all expended outwardly by the spirit. Not a single breath abides within the body—how then can one hope for the Dao of long life and enduring vision?

The Master said: "If one knows the governance of spirit and qi, the circulation of mother and child, then the gate to deathless longevity becomes visible. If qi lacks governance, left to mere breathing, it merely facilitates the five viscera and digests the five grains—unable to return yin to yang, to replenish blood and marrow."

The Master said: "I take spirit as my chariot and qi as my steed, driving them ceaselessly without weariness."

The Scripture says: "When the world possesses the Dao, even horses are retired to fertilize fields." This is precisely its meaning.

Master Yin the Perfected said: "When spirit can govern qi, the nose ceases to breathe." This saying is most profound.

The method of governing qi...

To the Niwan Palace above and the Gate of Life below, the two luminaries follow one another—thus may the decrepit and aged be restored. If in exhalation the spirit fails to govern, a single breath is incomplete; if in inhalation the spirit fails to govern, a single breath is likewise incomplete. If in every breath the spirit and qi can merge, then the embryo forms within the hidden qi, and the qi breathes within the formed embryo. When embryo and qi conjoin internally, death is forever banished.

Once the work is accomplished, in men the essence gathers, in women the infant coalesces—though desire may stir, it cannot contend with the spirit. This is called the true return of essence to spirit. Such is the secret of refining the breath in the Upper Clarity Jade Perfection tradition. Practiced daily, one naturally savors its flavor, gradually uniting with the Perfect Dao of the Most High.

**Master Haichan’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
The primordial qi is the mother of Heaven and Earth, the root of the Great Dao, the essence of yin and yang. In things it is called the pure and harmonious qi; in humans it is called the primordial qi—it is the nature and the life. In a single day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, through which the true qi constantly leaks from the mouth and nose. The sages who refine embryonic breathing for long periods store it in the cinnabar field, so that its subtle ingress and egress stabilize the body and secure long life. Long life means the heart and spirit-qi unite, merging with the Dao in truth.

**Master Xuanhu’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
The Great Dao takes emptiness as its root and the absence of form as its subtlety. Returning to the primordial, settling into quiescence and primordial simplicity, one draws qi into the cinnabar field, refines the spirit in the golden chamber, and stabilizes the heart in the ocean of awareness. When the heart is settled, the spirit is at peace; when the spirit is at peace, the qi abides; when the qi abides, the heart naturally rejoices. Constantly, within the hundred divisions of the day, one contains and guards the true breath.

It is also said: when spirit and breath settle, metal and wood intermingle; when heart and intention are at peace, dragon and tiger meet—this is the true function of the inner elixir and embryonic breathing. For those who cultivate the Dao, if they wish for long life without death, they must first refine the heart.

The Perfected One said: The heart lies one inch and three fen below the lungs. It is called the Jade Kettle, within which dwells a single qi of empty whiteness. The Scripture says: "From emptiness white arises"—it is called by one name the Jade Kettle, by another the Spirit Chamber, by another the Jade Palace, by another the Crimson Palace. Within it dwells the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, the deathless spirit, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the talisman of the Primordial Beginning, the Perfected One of Grand Unity, and the Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering. Constantly uphold the primordial qi, never allowing it to scatter. When the cinnabar sand coalesces, it is as large as a millet grain, its color like yellow gold—it is called the Precious Jade. If one can recognize, distinguish, and apprehend it, sealing the six gates and ever guarding the celestial truth, embryonic breathing forms of itself, and one may prolong life for ages without dying.

**Yuan Tiangang’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
Yin and yang are the true qi of Heaven and Earth. One yin, one yang, they give birth to the myriad things. In humans they are the qi of inhalation and exhalation; in Heaven they are the qi of cold and heat. It is also said: these two can alter the qi of the four seasons—this is the wu and ji that enclose and conceal the true qi.

It is said: when spring arrives in the xun position, it can bring forth the myriad things; when summer arrives in the kun position, it can nurture the myriad things; when autumn arrives in the qian position, it can ripen the myriad things; when winter arrives in the gen position, it can contain the myriad things. All these are the rising and descending, the emerging and submerging of yin and yang in their numinous function. Thus yang qi emerges from water and flourishes in wood; yin qi emerges from fire and flourishes in metal. Yang is born at zi and emerges at mao; yin is born at wu and enters at you. These four cardinal points are the gates and doors of Heaven and Earth.

The Great Dao must draw upon the correct qi of the four seasons. In all cultivation, movement and breath are yin; stillness and breath are yang. In practice, one must attain settled heart, settled strength, settled spirit, and settled breath—then dragon and tiger will intimately meet, and the sacred embryo will form. This is called the embryonic breathing of the Perfected One.

**The Formula for Embryonic Breathing of the Perfected One**
In all cultivation, first settle the heart and qi. When heart and qi are settled, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, the heart is at peace; when the heart is at peace, the qi ascends; when qi ascends, the realm is empty; when the realm is empty, there is clarity and stillness; when there is clarity and stillness, there is nothingness; when there is nothingness, life is whole; when life is whole, the Dao arises; when the Dao arises, forms are severed; when forms are severed, awareness is luminous; when awareness is luminous, the spirit is penetrating.

The Scripture says: "When the heart is penetrating, the myriad methods are all penetrating; when the heart is still, the myriad methods are all extinguished." This is the true concentration of the Tathāgata. For those who cultivate the Dao, first cultivate the method of settling the heart. Once the method of settling is attained, the returned elixir is not far, the golden liquid is not distant—immortality is achieved.

**Master Xu Shen’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
The spirit is the function of the empty and primordial; the breath is the function of the primordial qi. Refine away the boundaries of the dusty world—whether right or wrong, self or others, wealth or beauty, grasping or relinquishing, enmity or kinship—all are equal and uniform. Naturally, protection and assistance arise, and the Dao-heart is accomplished.

The Scripture says: "The spirit is the function of emptiness." Essence, qi, and spirit—these three are the numinous terrace. For those who cultivate, if the three of breath, settled essence, qi, and spirit are attained, one may live long without dying and become an immortal who transcends the world—this is no empty claim.

**Master Yanluo’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
That which moves is originally moving; that which is still is originally still. In ancient times, there was originally no movement or stillness—movement and stillness share a single source. Yet because all sentient beings are deluded and their thoughts unsettled, the sages left teachings to instruct people in settling the breath. When the spirit follows the settled breath, and the qi abides, the spirit settles. If the qi moves, the heart moves; if the heart moves, the spirit is wearied.

For those who cultivate the Dao, if they do not practice embryonic breathing, there remains the source of movement and stillness—how then can they enter the gate of non-action? They will lose their way.

**Damo Chan Master’s Formula for Embryonic Breathing**
To refine embryonic breathing is to refine qi and settle the heart. Constantly breathe at the heart-wheel, then one does not cling to the myriad things. If the qi is unsettled, even Chan is empty. If the qi is settled, the colored body is free from illness, and both Chan and the Dao are at peace.

For cultivators who fail to guard the heart, the primordial qi scatters and cannot be gathered—how then can the Dao be accomplished? The ancients said: when qi is settled, the heart is settled; when qi congeals, the heart is still—this is the essence of the Great Dao, also called the Returned Elixir. The Daoist, free from all attachments, practices thus daily, and this is called true samādhi and contemplation. Thus, the sages and worthies of the three times all cultivated by this method, known as the dual cultivation of Chan and samādhi.

**Li Zhenren’s Embryonic Breathing Formula (Taboo Name: Ziming)**
For true embryonic breathing, enter a pure chamber, burn incense, face the wall, sit cross-legged with the soles of the feet turned upward, free the heart from attachments, and empty the mind of thoughts. Calm the spirit and settle the breath, constantly observing it throughout the body—naturally, it will flow unimpeded. Learners must not fully close the breath, for complete closure harms the spirit. Instead, gauge the length of one’s own breath, allowing qi to enter and exit without being heard by the ear—this is the subtle method. If one constantly regulates the breath, neither exhaling nor inhaling, and over time abides in the cinnabar field, firmly guarding it, this is called true embryonic breathing. The Dao will surely be accomplished!

**Baopuzi’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
All cultivators must settle the breath. Breath is correctness, peace, harmony, return, submission, tranquility, and stillness. If one constantly practices thus in the four dignified postures, one will surely enter the true Dao. Do not cling to any realm; empty the heart and fill the abdomen—this is most subtle. Simply calm the breath and settle the heart: when the heart is settled, qi becomes quiescent; when qi is quiescent, the spirit becomes still; when the spirit is still, the realm becomes empty; when the realm is empty, there is extinction; when there is extinction, there is no affair; when there is no affair, there is purity; when there is purity, the Dao arises; when the Dao arises, there is spontaneity; when there is spontaneity, there is freedom. Having entered freedom, there is boundless ease, and one becomes an immortal. Naturally, the Five Agents gather, the Six Qi harmonize, the Eight Trigrams pair, and the inner elixir is formed. The body and form endure forever without decay.

**Kang Cangzi’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
In all cultivation and entry into the Dao, quiet the heart and do not disturb the spirit; do not leak qi and scatter the spirit; do not startle the breath and trouble the body; do not speak and exhaust the breath; do not speak and deplete the blood; do not stagnate the breath and swallow; do not distance the breath and weep; do not abandon the breath and act carelessly; do not anger the breath and disturb the spirit; do not worry the breath and harbor resentment; do not think of the breath and cling to the self; do not contend and harm the breath; do not remember others. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, constantly maintain this practice—the heart will naturally be joyful, and accomplishment will come of itself. Without cultivating this principle, one wastes effort and will never succeed. But if one practices thus daily, the elixir will surely be formed. When movement and stillness are both forgotten, the Dao is attained without seeking.

**Yuan Xian Zhenren’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
Those who study non-action embryonic breathing cultivate only the originally pure heart, also called true suchness, which is fundamentally empty. It resembles the great void: without going or coming, without above or below, neither moving nor still, utterly silent and vast, of the same body as true emptiness, of the same source as the Great Dao, and meeting the original face. If one cultivates the Great Dao, one should cultivate non-action. The heart is clear and empty, quiescent yet without quiescence, still yet without stillness. When the heart is settled and the realm fades, when both heart and realm are forgotten, one enters the true Dao of non-action. If cultivators practice this method, the elixir will form of itself, and naturally, qi will settle, achieving embryonic breathing.

**He Xiangu’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
Refinement is cultivation; breath is harmony, spirit, and essence. The root of breathing qi is the pure and tranquil true qi. Observe it entering the cinnabar field, exhaling and inhaling subtly. Thus, the dragon and tiger are naturally subdued. If the heart is without movement, the spirit without thought, and harmony without desire, this is called the Great Samādhi. When true qi abides in the form, one attains the rank of a true immortal, with boundless transformations, and is called a true person. For embryonic breathing, one must preserve the spirit and settle the intent, embracing and guarding the Three Passes—essence, qi, and spirit. All cultivators must constantly embrace and guard these three methods in every period of the day, and naturally, treasures will gather. The nation will be prosperous and the people at peace; the heart-king will be free, the spirit harmonious and smooth, illness rare, vexations few, the body light and agile, the ears sharp and the eyes bright. This is the direct path of true cultivation. If one practices this method for three to five years, heaven will protect, spirits will aid, and ordinary people will love and respect. Over time, one will naturally attain the Dao.

**Yu Yun Zhang Guolao’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
The embryo is the palace of conception. Breathing qi is received in the primordial sea, one inch and three fen below the navel, called the cinnabar field. There, true essence forms the body, receiving the qi of heaven and earth. In the first month, it is like a pearl; in the second, like dew; in the third, like a peach or plum—this is called the pure and harmonious qi, the uncarved block. While the child is in the mother’s womb, when the mother exhales, it exhales; when the mother inhales, it inhales. By the tenth month, the qi is full, and it is born. The six senses turn outward, no longer returning to the original state, failing to guard the inner breath—thus, there is birth and death. Therefore, the sage said: “I do not indulge the Three Corpses; the six senses constantly rest in the cinnabar field, guarding without retreat.” All cultivators must first cultivate the gate of heart-stillness. It is also said: “Understanding the heart and cultivating the Dao saves effort and is easily accomplished. Without understanding the heart and cultivating the Dao, one wastes effort to no avail.” First, understand the source of the heart, then naturally settle. The dragon and tiger will be subdued, and the immortal Dao will surely be accomplished. The cinnabar field lies one inch and three fen below the navel—it is the palace of primordial qi, governing the three hundred and sixty spirits of radiant essence, guarding and protecting the primordial qi. Within it sits a divine turtle, inhaling and exhaling primordial qi. In one day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, all of primordial qi, which leak out through the mouth and nose, allowing pathogenic qi to invade and cause illness.

The cinnabar field is the source of generative qi. It has ten names: first, *cinnabar field*; second, *essence-path*; third, *qi-sea*; fourth, *guardian palace*; fifth, *great source*; sixth, *spirit chamber*; seventh, *primordial treasury*; eighth, *treasure-gathering*; ninth, *wu-ji* (戊己); and tenth, *root origin*. All are the dwelling place of grand harmony and primordial qi. If one stores essence and qi within the cinnabar field, one attains the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.

All practitioners must constantly contain and absorb true breath within the cinnabar field during movement, stillness, sitting, and rest. Thus, primordial qi becomes substantial, and through long refinement, one becomes an immortal. This is the true adept’s *embryonic breathing*.

**Master Hou’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
The realm of true unity does not depart from its source. The source is the One Heart. When the heart does not move or act, it is the source; when the source does not halt or abide, it is the heart. If the heart is pure and still, it becomes the great elixir; if the heart is deluded and chaotic, it becomes the great thief—seizing one’s essence, stealing one’s spirit, ruining one’s furnace, losing one’s elixir, harming one’s body, and forfeiting one’s life.

All Dao practitioners must first cultivate the method of stilling the heart. Through heart-stilling, one attains a settled mind. When the mind is settled, the spirit is at peace; lead and mercury unite, and dragon and tiger become intimate. When the celestial cycle is complete, essence is replenished, qi is augmented, and the spirit is nourished. If these three methods are perfected, the myriad spirits gather in the cinnabar field, blood and qi circulate throughout the body, and one roams freely in the Dao of longevity.

It is also said: How does one attain purity and stillness? By clarifying the spirit, cutting off thoughts, dissolving the self, extinguishing external realms, and embracing the true—this is the wondrous Dao of stillness.

**Master Guiguzi’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
All Dao practitioners return to their origin and restore purity, inwardly uniting with true qi. When the Dao returns, the four images, five phases, six qi, seven origins, and eight trigrams refine essence, qi, and spirit to form their substance. This is taking the substantial from the void, the existent from the nonexistent, and inwardly concealing the true elixir.

Thus, refining the heart produces spirit, refining essence produces form, and refining qi produces life—these are the ascending and descending qi of yin and yang. The source of qi is the root of life. Therefore, cultivating these three methods is the great Dao.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
All Dao practitioners must constantly practice inward contemplation, dispelling the three corpses and transcending the six emotions. They return inwardly to preserve the three treasures, with the heart-spirit guarding its palace and qi sealed without dissipation. The myriad spirits rejoice, qi is nourished, form is refined, and nature is preserved. These three methods cannot be abandoned—they are the true unity of embryonic breathing and the great elixir of the mysterious pass.

**Master Chen Xiyi’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
The Dao transforms youth into age, age into illness, illness into death, death into spirit, and spirit into the myriad things. Qi transforms into living beings, essence transforms into form, and the three—spirit, qi, and essence—refine into true immortals.

Thus, it is said: Preserve essence, nourish spirit, and refine qi—these are the three divine powers, which one must not fail to know. Zi-wu (子午), mao-you (卯酉), and the four seasons are the gates of yin and yang’s entry and exit. A settled mind unmoving is called *chan* (meditation); spirit penetrating myriad changes is called *ling* (numinous); wisdom comprehending all matters is called *hui* (wisdom); the Dao’s origin uniting with qi is called *cultivation*; true qi returning to its source is called *refinement*; dragon and tiger uniting is called *elixir*; and the three elixirs harmonizing is called *completion*. If practitioners know this root source, they may draw near to the Dao.

**Master Xiaoyaozi’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
Cultivation is resolve and nurturance; nurturance is sustenance, concealment, and truth. To nurture breath, one must first nurture essence; to nurture essence, one must first nurture spirit; to nurture spirit, one must first nurture nature; to nurture nature, one must first nurture life. Nature and life are spirit and qi, hun and po, yin and yang, *li* and *kan*. Through prolonged practice, the sacred embryo forms—this is true embryonic breathing.

**Master Zhang the Celestial Master’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
Primordial qi is formless, the true heart is lawless, and the great Dao is not near. Only the method of refining breath contains the true Dao.

It is also said: When heart is settled, qi is settled, and spirit is settled, all Dao practitioners who unite with the primordial Dao of the great elixir—cleansing emptiness, stilling thoughts, forgetting intentions, and abiding in quiescence without phenomena—engage in true embryonic breathing and will undoubtedly become immortals.

**Master Guo’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
Refinement is cultivation, nurturance, and emptiness. The ears do not hear, the eyes do not see, the nose does not smell, the tongue does not taste, and breath and qi settle the heart. This method arises from non-being into being, from non-existence into existence, from non-form into form, from non-emptiness into emptiness. It is not being as being, not non-being as non-being, not form as form, not emptiness as emptiness—this is the true method of embryonic breathing, nurturing harmony, and regulating the spirit.

It is also said: Seeing without perceiving the self, hearing without attaining sound, transcending all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao, the highest method.

**The Central Yellow-Old Lord’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
The root of heaven and earth arises from yin and yang. Pure qi becomes heaven, turbid qi becomes earth; pure qi becomes the heart, and turbid qi becomes the kidneys. Yet worldly entanglements stir the human heart, causing pure and turbid to remain undivided.

How can one comprehend this principle? In every action, movement, sight, and sound, the five thieves steal one’s true origin: the eyes transmit to the heart, and the heart’s movement wearies the spirit; the ears transmit to the heart, and the heart conveys sounds to the kidneys, exhausting the spirit and vexing the heart—thus, all is ruined. If thoughts stir, true qi leaks, and embryonic breathing cannot form.

How then can it be achieved? If one sits in stillness, thoughts unmoving, breath forgotten, and emotions stilled, qi and spirit harmonize, and through prolonged practice, one naturally becomes an immortal.

**Master Liu’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**
People often live in the world yet do not know what daily phenomena create within themselves.

Alas! This is the qi of the great heavens. When primordial essence does not decline, things coalesce into vessels: above, they rely on the heavens’ pure qi, gathering to form shape; below, they connect with the earth’s turbid qi, congealing to form substance. Within, they contain the One True, yet worldly people do not recognize it, thus leaking it outward—this is essence, qi, and spirit. If one does not guard these three, old age and death draw near. The sage never strays from these three methods: in movement and stillness, waking and sleeping, through long practice they coalesce into the embryo, and one becomes an immortal.

A verse says:
People live in the world yet know not their root,
Ever greedy, they cast aside their true origin.
Neglecting the primordial yang and true breathing qi,
They incur heaven’s wrath and illness clings to the body.

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of the Old Mother of Mount Li**
The sutra states: Heaven and earth steal from the myriad things, the myriad things steal from humans, and humans steal from the myriad things. Thus, the three thieves oppose one another, scattering and losing the true radiance of spirit, and embryonic breathing cannot form. If the practitioner does not covet the myriad things, they will not steal your original nature. Therefore it is said: The true Daoist of one’s allotted portion—I do not take what is yours, and you do not take what is mine—only guard your portion. What is guarding one’s portion? It is neither issuing forth nor entering in, constantly guarding the original source, neither moving nor still, neither coming nor going, seemingly existent yet seemingly nonexistent—this is the living dead. Immortality is near!

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of Immortal Li**
People of the world who uphold the Dao and maintain cultivation must pay homage to the true and repent of transgressions. On days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, on the anniversaries of parents’ distant passing, and on the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, one should perform purification rites and offer sacrifices, so that the gods and heavens will protect and bless. Moreover, if each day one remains serene and untroubled, calming the heart and sitting in stillness, regulating spirit and nurturing qi, never leaving the inner chamber, then naturally the Three Palaces will ascend and descend, the Six Qi will circulate, the hundred meridians will flow unimpeded, and the myriad things will gather in the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court is the Central Palace. If one constantly guards the Central Palace, essence and qi will not leak—this is true embryonic breathing.

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of the Daoist of Mount Tiantai**
In cultivation, one must always practice equanimity and forbearance, utterly rejecting the arising of deviant thoughts, with true heart and resolute will. Circulate the qi of heart and kidneys, moving them up and down to unite in the Central Palace. Let the various spirits not scatter, warmly nurture the primordial qi, and cinnabar and the yellow sprout will naturally emerge. Deep roots and firm stems yield perpetual breathing, and through long practice, one attains longevity, leaves the world, and achieves the Dao.

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of Master Liu**
In practicing the primordial method of embryonic breathing, the heart must not kill, not desire, not steal, not covet, not be deviant, not be deluded, not be arrogant, not be reckless. The heart becomes bright and clear, and by constantly maintaining purification and precepts, true breathing is ever regulated, and illumination pervades the body and world. When body and heart are pure and still, this is longevity. The Daoist is like a gold mine or a treasure trove—firm and solid. If the Six Gates do not open, deviant qi cannot enter, and the whole body remains free of illness. If the Six Gates are not closed, thieves will plunder the golden treasure, and one will fall ill. The Dao will not be achieved!

A verse says:
The true qi within the heart is heaven’s essence,
Just when spirit is clear and qi is like a mirror.
If the great Dao relies on its wondrous function,
Within the heart’s purity, qi gives birth to the numinous.
Going and coming without pause,
Above and below ceaselessly, creation is accomplished.
When spirit is still and qi is settled, untouched by affairs,
This time, breathing abides and the natural numinous arises.

Those who study later but do not rest in the primordial Dao, whose idle thoughts never cease, whose arising and ceasing never end, will be swept away by external things. How can embryonic breathing be achieved?

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of Langranzi**
In cultivation, one must burn incense, enter the chamber, sit in stillness, and empty the heart. Knock the teeth to gather the spirits, stabilize the mind-horse, and subdue the heart-monkey, collecting them all in one place and settling them in the Cinnabar Field to warm and nurture them. Inwardly observe without issuing forth, like a general leading an army. Spirit is the commander, qi is the army. Where qi goes, spirit follows; the two move together and must not be separated. A thousand disasters are extinguished, and ten thousand illnesses do not afflict. If the practitioner of the Dao attains this method and diligently practices it—today this poor Daoist reveals the celestial mechanism. If you do not practice it, I will incur misfortune.

**The Embryonic Breathing Formula of Inward Vision within the Hundred Peaks**
Embryonic breathing is unknown to worldly people, yet all worthies attain realization through it. Without this method, one cannot hold fast; without the oral transmission, one cannot begin; without direct instruction, one cannot proceed. Even if guided by hand, one may still fail to master it. Some foolish people attempt to stabilize the heart-monkey and capture the mind-horse, yet waste their efforts in vain, accomplishing nothing. If the true cultivator wishes to capture the heart-monkey and subdue the mind-horse, they must first regulate qi and settle breathing, then calm the heart, still thoughts, and forget emotions—only then can they succeed. Without doing so, time and days pass in vain. Without a teacher’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know.

**Cao the Immortal Maiden’s Embryonic Breathing Formula**

Embryonic breathing cannot be achieved through mere methods or techniques. Those who attempt it by such means stray far from the Dao. When a person is born, the spirit must be preserved, qi retained, and the Dao cultivated—spirit and qi depend upon each other to complete one’s nature and life. Emptiness allows the numinous to flow freely and radiance to shine; harmony circulates smoothly and nourishes with softness. When the spirit is at peace, qi flows unimpeded; when qi flows unimpeded, the blood harmonizes; when the blood harmonizes, the bones strengthen; when the bones strengthen, the marrow fills; when the marrow fills, the abdomen swells; when the abdomen swells, the lower body solidifies; when the lower body solidifies, one’s steps become light and vigorous; when steps are light and vigorous, movement brings no fatigue; when the four limbs are healthy and strong, it is like a nation’s borders at peace and prosperous. When qi and blood are harmonious and abundant, it is like a nation’s treasuries full. It is like a wealthy household—spirit and will are harmonious and joyful, the complexion naturally brightens, and one’s steps become like dancing. The Dao of immortality is near.

Thus it is said: Today’s people recite the Buddha’s name or invoke the Dao only to avert disaster and seek blessings, yet they would do better to focus their minds on eliminating delusion. Is this not excellent? Those of insight who observe and practice this will naturally achieve embryonic breathing.

**Here ends the formula for the embryonic spirit’s application, as transmitted by the perfected sages.**
