**Memorial Presenting the Red Writ for Prolonging Life**
*Memorial from Pei Xuan, Hermit of Mount Zhongnan, to the Throne*

Your subject has heard that what illuminates the eight wilds is the sun, and what resounds through ten thousand ages is the Dao. Thus, true clarity does not arise from antiquity alone, nor does the body of virtue lie beyond oneself. For this reason, the sage purifies the heart to attain the Supreme Dao as effortlessly as treading upon level ground.

Now, qi has no fixed form, yet it aligns with the constancy of the Dao—yielding yet unyielding, elusive yet inescapable. In its subtlety, it may seem small, but in its vastness, it is boundless. Your humble subject, fortunate to live in an age of sagely rule, has been granted the honor of emulating the recluses Chao and You. Dwelling in the heart of the mountains, where the transformative power of the Dao moistens all things, I have pored over the classics of the Ru and sought the subtle truths of Daoist scriptures. Therein, I encountered the Perfected Words of the Immortals for preserving life, and my thoughts turned to the eternal longevity of the sovereign and his kin. These Perfected Words, though veiled in secrecy and obscured by the dust of ages, are as clear as the mirror of Heaven. Yet, fearing that my private devotion might weary the sagely gaze, I have distilled their essence, giving voice to their true resonance. What is presented here is but a single thread of their luminous whole, a modest offering of what little I have grasped. For joy eases accomplishment, and what is seen does not unsettle the common mind—this is the very Dao of imperial supremacy.

As the scriptures say: *"When kings and lords attain the One, they become the standard for all under Heaven."* These are no empty words! This work is indeed the ladder by which the Supreme Mystery’s Ancient Perfected ascend to eternal life. Thus, I have titled it *The Red Writ of the Supreme Mystery’s Lofty Perfected for Prolonging Life*.

The "Red Writ" signifies, above, the stellar fire that aids the virtue of Earth; in the middle, the vermilion brilliance of high summer; and below, the crimson sincerity of your humble subject’s devotion. The *Numinous Scripture* states: *"To bring peace to the realm and turn calamity into fortune, one must employ the Red Writ of the Five Elders as a talisman."* Now, as the Three Qi blaze in their seasonal splendor and the divine time of celebration descends, I dare to present this *Writ for Prolonging Life*, hoping to express the rites of felicitous offering.

Prostrate, I contemplate Your Majesty, the *August Emperor of the Kaiyuan Era, Sagely in Culture, Divine in Martiality, Who Models Heaven and Embodies the Supreme Dao*—Your Dao fills the vastness of Heaven, Your sheltering grace knows no partiality, Your virtue flows through the depth of Earth, and Your radiance is without end. You do not disdain the words of a shepherd boy; how could You scorn the humble speech of a grass-cutter? If these words are not cast aside as worthless, it will be the great fortune of all under Heaven!

This scroll contains eight chapters, comprising several thousand characters—all the profound utterances of the myriad sages and lofty Perfected. Held in the palm, it suffices to reveal the Dao of long life.

**1. The Rushing Brilliance of the Eastern Marchmount**

Yu and Lin are the spirits of the Great Yang and Great Yin, respectively. The Controller of Destinies of the Eastern Marchmount says: *"By day, visualize the sun; by night, visualize the moon, as if in a small ring. Envision the sun as crimson, radiating nine beams of purple light; envision the moon as yellow, emitting ten beams of white light. Place the sun to the left and the moon to the right, allowing the two luminous essences to merge with the pupils of the eyes and circulate their qi. Swallow the saliva without count, and silently practice this method to gather and refine the generative essence, harmonizing the hun and po. The Six Ding spirits will attend you, and heavenly soldiers will stand guard."*

The Supreme Perfected of the Highest Realms have always kept this secret between sleeve and elbow, transmitting it under solemn oath.

The Lady of the Southern Culmen says: *"Visualize within the heart a sun of purple light, the size of a coin, crimson and bearing nine beams. Let it rise from the heart, ascend through the throat to the teeth, then return to the stomach. After a long while, close your eyes—you will perceive the heart, intestines, and stomach with clarity. Exhale, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow thirty-nine times before stopping. Practice this thrice daily. After ten years, you will cast no shadow at noon, repel all malign influences, and become an immortal."*

The Lord of the Western City says: *"Constantly visualize the moon within the Mud Pill. At night, absorb the moon’s radiance as you would the sun’s. Envision the moon with ten beams of white light, descending from the brain into the throat, then returning to the stomach—just as with the sun. The Mud Pill is the spirit of the brain, the most revered among the body’s spirits."*

The *Inner Methods of the Red Lord, Perfected of the Great Void*, states: *"On the fifth night of each month, at midnight, visualize the moon within the heart. Let the sun enter through the mouth, illuminating the heart’s interior until their lights merge. When complete, you will feel warmth in the heart. After long practice, silently recite the incantation..."*

Great Brilliance nurtures the elixir, refining essence within to forge gold. Their radiance merges and reflects, and the true spirit comes to seek you. Upon completing the recitation, swallow saliva up to nine times.

On the fifteenth and twenty-ninth days of each month, repeat the above method. This enables one to perceive light with clarity, the face to glow with jade-like radiance, and the body to be moistened with golden luster. After fifteen years of practice, the Most High will dispatch a treasure chariot to welcome you. Cultivation should be frequent, not bound to specific days.

The oral instructions of the Daoist of the Azure Ox say: *"At night, before sleep, visualize the sun above the forehead and the moon above the navel—this repels a thousand ghosts and ten thousand malign influences."* This method is profoundly efficacious.

*The Preface to the Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* states: *"To ascend as an immortal, one must summon the spirits of the body. If there is any disorder, call upon the spirit of the affected part to remedy it—results will be immediate."*

The ears, nose, and tongue each govern their own domains, with spirits residing in distinct palaces; thus, each is invoked by a separate name:
- Spirit of the eyebrows: Heavenly Cloud
- Spirit of the brain: Primal First
- Spirit of the whiskers: Eastern King Father
- Spirit of the ears: Delicate Maiden
- Spirit of the eyes: Heroic Brilliance
- Spirit of the hair: Longevity
- Spirit of the nose: Penetrating Reed
- Spirit of the mouth: Cinnabar Pearl
- Spirit of the tongue: Cinnabar Yellow
- Spirit of the teeth: Guardian
- Spirit of the throat: Martial Rush
- Spirit of the shoulders: Profound Spirit
- Spirit of the hands: Yin of the Hun-soul
- Spirit of the heart: Kissing Pottery
- Spirit of the lungs: Overseeing
- Spirit of the gallbladder: Seizing
- Spirit of the stomach: Obstructing
- Spirit of the spleen: Assisting
- Spirit of the kidneys: Flowing
- Spirit of the navel: Jade Spirit
- Spirit of the Cinnabar Field: Treasured Essence
- Spirit of the large intestine: Supporting
- Spirit of the small intestine: Beam
- Spirit of the intestines: Exhausted Hero
- Spirit of the belly: Yin
- Spirit of the knees: Region
- Spirit of the shins: Confucius
- Spirit of the feet: Heaven-Standing Valiant One

Before sleep, always first visualize these spirits—ghosts and malevolent beings cannot then deceive you. Visualizing them on the last day of the lunar month, the first day, the quarter moons, and the full moon is especially effective.

**Purifying the Heart and Inner Taboos, Second Chapter**

The *Records of Dengdu* states: One must avoid speaking of the study of the Dao. Why? Words uttered outwardly will surely invite ghosts and malevolent beings to afflict a person, bringing illness. If one’s body is not yet perfected, one cannot but be cautious. The *Oral Instructions of the Sacred Mother of Shuling* says: Those who study immortality must be prudent in speech, for the mountain spirits and the hundred spirits will test them. Liu Jing also ascended as an immortal by employing this method.

The *Laozi’s Scripture on Nurturing the Spirit* states: When rinsing the mouth, one must avoid facing north or northwest, for the Dark Palace of Fengdu lies in the *hai* direction, and thus one must avoid doing so by the water’s edge. Many who fall ill cannot be saved—there is indeed a reason for this. If afflicted, recite the names of the Six Palaces to be spared. The names of the Six Palaces are recorded in the third chapter. One must strictly avoid gazing upon images above the water’s surface, for it often brings illness.

It further states: To chant or sing while feigning sleep is to invite misfortune. If one exposes oneself and is stricken by severe illness, there will be no regret. It also says: When combing one’s hair, one must not face north, for this brings great remorse. To let loose one’s hair is to draw near to the Yin Lord, allowing ghosts to take advantage. Even stepping on filth will cause emaciation and lingering illness.

The Lady of South Marchmount says: One’s bedchamber must be fragrant and clean. If unclean, one will be disturbed by stale *qi*, and the study of the Dao will be difficult to accomplish—this is deeply forbidden. It also says: When sleeping in the woods, one should choose a high place. If high, earthly *qi* will not reach, and the breath of ghosts will not invade. Otherwise, ghostly *qi* will rise from the ground to assail a person. The woods should be three feet and six inches high, for ghosts, being formless, cling to objects to manifest. Thus, at three feet and six inches, ghostly *qi* cannot reach. The ancient historian Yong once saw a ghost clinging to the ground, blowing through a tube at people—those who study the Dao must be especially cautious.

The oral instructions of the immortal Chen Anshi say: When combing one’s hair or partaking in food and drink upon one’s mat, one must not allow those who are not of the Dao to see or approach. If seen, the ghostly forms of the profane and the dead will invade one’s spirit. This is why those who dwell in the mountains seek to distance themselves from such people. Guard this secret!

The *True Radiance* states: Those who cultivate life must not weep excessively or spit often, for both deplete the fluids and drain the essence, leaving the throat and brain empty and exhausted. Thus, the perfected ones constantly practice breath regulation and saliva swallowing to restore their vitality.

The ancient master of the mysteries says: One cannot bathe too frequently—the fault lies in people’s inability to do so. Washing away foulness and grime allows true *qi* to arrive.

The *True Reports* states: On *jiayin* and *gengshen* days, corpse-ghosts vie to disturb the spirit—these are days of restlessness and impurity. One must not engage in intimate conversation or laughter with women on such days. Dispel all desires on these days to preserve one’s primordial auspiciousness.

The oral instructions of the immortal Liu Gang say: Those who seek immortality must not lie with women on the following days: the first day of the first lunar month, the third day of the second month, the ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month. On these days, if one engages in intercourse, the Six Corpses will disorder the viscera, blood will seep, the Three Hun will lose their guard, and spirit and *qi* will wither away, leading to death over time—this is why these days are forbidden. On such days, if one does not restrain oneself, the blood will seep, and the female palace, being in *yin* and *shen* (which clash), will cause the sun to emerge from the red pupil of the eye. Thus, the female corpse summons the male, and the male corpse summons the female, bringing reciprocal calamity, harming the spirit, and breaking the essence. Though one may not perceive the clash, the numinous is already damaged, for the Three Corpses wage war within the eyes, causing blood to flow into the Mud Pill Palace. On these days, one must absolutely avoid seeing favored concubines or beloved women. The immortal masters simply follow this Way to attain longevity.

The Perfected One of Purple Yang says: Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To go against the *po* and return to the true is to refine one’s turbid *po*—otherwise, one will perish of one’s own accord.

The *Secret Instructions of the Great Cavern* states: If one dreams at night and feels content upon waking, it is a fortunate omen. Upon waking, one should rub the eyes twenty-one times, then click the teeth twenty-one times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme High Essence, Radiant Spirits of the Three Emperors.
The Vermilion Palace shines clearly, reporting auspicious omens.
The Three Origins soothe the *po*, the Heavenly Sovereign receives the scripture.
All endeavors harmonize, ascending to the Upper Clarity.
Ever accompanied by Jade Maidens, together we meet in the Purple Court.
All ill dreams become auspicious."*

**Outer Prohibitions for Purifying the Spirit, Third Chapter**

*The Dengdu Record* states: If one knows the names of the Six Palaces of Dengdu, then the hundred ghosts dare not harm them. When going out, first face north and softly recite the incantation three times:

*"I am a disciple of the Supreme High, governing the Six Heavens below. The officials of the Six Heavens are under my command—not only under my command, but also under the dominion of the Supreme High. I know the names of the Six Heavenly Officials, which ensure my long life. Should any dare to transgress, the Supreme High will sever your form."*

The names of the Six Palaces are:
First Palace: *Zhoujue Yintian* Official
Second Palace: *Taisha Liangshi Zongtian* Official
Third Palace: *Mingchen Nai Fan Wucheng Tian* Official
Fourth Palace: *Tianhei Zuiqi Tian* Palace
Fifth Palace: *Zongling Qifei Tian* Official
Sixth Palace: *Gansi Lian Wanlü Tian* Official

After reciting, click the teeth sixty times before going out, to repel the qi of the myriad evils. Practicing this for ten days will erase one’s name from the register of the dead and grant rebirth in the Southern Palace.

*The Scripture of the Great Cinnabar of the Cavern Chamber* states: Evil dreams arise from three causes—first, the *po*-demon; second, the testing of the heart; third, the corpse-thief. To dispel them, upon waking, press the philtrum with the left hand twenty-one times, click the teeth twenty-one times, and recite the incantation:

*"Great Cavern, True and Mysterious, Zhang refines the Three Hun.
The first hun swiftly guards the Seven Po,
The second hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,
The third hun receives the heart’s command.
Swiftly invoke the Supreme High Primordial Lord:
‘Just now, an inauspicious dream arose—
the Seven Po’s wandering corpse came to join with the source of evil.
Hasten to summon Peach-Kang to protect life,
dispel the malign essence, and turn misfortune into fortune.
No cause for life or death remains.’"*

Practicing this without cease, one will sit and perceive the auspicious and inauspicious events of the future.

*The Dengdu Record* states: When walking at night, one should constantly sound the Heavenly Drum, without a fixed number of strikes. This can repel the hundred ghosts, for evil spirits all fear the sound of clicking teeth and thus dare not approach. Formerly, Master Bao of Qi suffered from wind, and his teeth naturally clicked together. When ghosts came to claim him, they heard the sound of his clicking teeth and kept their distance. He lived to one hundred thirty years, crossing spring ice without sinking until his end.

It is said: If even the clicking of teeth in the wind achieves this, how much more so for those who deliberately practice it?

**Concealing the Mysterious and Hooking the Spirits, Fourth Chapter**

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Dao of nurturing life begins with recognizing one’s own form, visualizing it with utmost clarity until it stands vividly before the eyes. On the face, the radiance of the sun and moon shines forth, illuminating the entire form. Place the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine inches from the face. After visualization, click the teeth three times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Primordial Womb, Supreme Perfected,
Twin Effulgences of the Two Mysteries,
On the right, embrace the Seven Po,
On the left, embrace the Three Hun.
Concentrate on my spirit luminants!
Let them ever abide with my form."*

After reciting, click the teeth twenty-one times and swallow saliva seven times. This is called the method of the *Celestial Lord Recording the Form, Restraining the Hun, and Controlling the Po*, enabling one to become an immortal and live forever without dying.

Furthermore, in all matters of visualizing spirits and practicing the arts of the perfected immortals, the bedding and mats one uses must be kept fresh and clean, avoiding any stains or filth, lest the Three Hun and Seven Po take residence therein—this is deeply forbidden.

*The Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmonious Practice* states: When sitting, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, one will perceive them with perfect clarity.

*The Method of Inward Vision in the Crimson Radiance of the Purple Empyrean* states: Whenever going out, settle the body, close the eyes, and inwardly gaze while listening afar to the four directions, focusing vision and hearing upon places a thousand miles away. With concentrated effort, one will eventually see events a hundred miles distant. The "four directions" are a general term—one should begin by focusing on one direction for vision and hearing. Initially, there may be no tangible result, but with prolonged sincerity, one will naturally enter the wondrous and summon the true.

Lady Wang of Yunlin said: The Dao of the perfected immortals takes the ears and eyes as its foundation. Prolonged gazing strains the eyes, and excessive listening dulls the ears—this malady arises from within and rushes outward, with no other cause. At midnight, first close the eyes, face east, and with the thumbs behind the palms, wipe toward the ear openings, crossing the hands at the nape of the neck twenty-seven times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, cyan, and crimson—emerging before the eyes. This is the inner pressing of the Three Pure Clouds to irrigate and unite with the Youthful Lad. Recite the yin incantation:

*"Eye Lads of the Three Clouds,
True Lords of the Two Eyes,
Heroic and luminous, they concentrate essence,
Opening and penetrating the pure spirit.
Cloud Emblem of the Great Mystery,
Spiritual Steeds soaring lightly,
Protect and benefit the Twin Gates,
Unseal and illuminate the Nine Portals.
The hundred joints respond in resonance,
Morning saliva flies the body,
Ascending to the Jade Palace,
Ennobled as Supreme Perfected."*

After reciting, swallow saliva fifty times. With prolonged practice, one will see clearly for a thousand miles. This is also the Dao of the true immortals, not merely for brightening the ears and eyes.

The Perfected of Azure Spirit said: In the method of guarding the Mysterious and White, sit calmly and visualize black qi in the Mud-Pill Palace, white qi in the heart, and yellow qi in the navel, all arising like clouds to cover the body. They then transform into a great fire, burning the body inside and out. If practiced from dawn to noon, it enables one to live forever without dying. These methods complement one another; practicing them in alternation yields even greater benefit.

The Lord of Preserving Life said: When a person concentrates the heart in bowing, the bow reaches the heart. During circular movement, the furnace is activated, with left and right motions as if conducting affairs. This is called *inwardly refining the Great Mystery, practicing the work of emptiness, perching in the Three Palaces, and reclining in the divine mansion*. Formerly, Lord Zhao practiced this and moved the Supreme High to descend, whereupon he ascended as an immortal.

**Preserving Life and Calming Qi, Fifth Chapter**

Master Pei’s *Scripture of Preserving the Spirit* states: When a person grows old, it seldom begins anywhere but the ears and eyes. The area below the eyes and above the cheekbones is where the *Brightness-Centered Preservation of Life* returns to infancy. Rub this area with the hands in endless cycles—this is called the *Dao of Circulating Blood, Dispersing Wrinkles, Harmonizing Essence, and Preserving the Spirit to Sustain Life*.

The text further states: Place the hands upon the forehead, inwardly envisioning a youthful figure or the twin luminaries of sun and moon. Repeat this upward and downward motion, accumulating counts until three nines are reached—this is called *the hands paying homage to the Three Origins, the Dao of fortifying the brain and strengthening the hair*. Encompass the four sides of the head with both hands, smoothing the hair and untying knots, ensuring thoroughness. Thus, the blood of the head flows and disperses, and wind-dampness does not congeal.

When complete, press the four corners of the eyes with the hands, reaching two nines in total. This enables the eyes to perceive light—*the Dao of inspecting the spirit of the eyes*. With prolonged practice, one may behold the hundred spirits. It is even better if the hands never leave the face; even accomplished perfected beings do not abandon this.

The *Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: Upon the face, one should constantly rub with both hands, ensuring warmth across all areas, which grants the face a lustrous glow. Practicing this for five years, the complexion becomes like that of a maiden—*the flowing qi of mountains and rivers, ever full and never depleted*.

The *Scripture of the Supreme High’s Opening of Heaven* states: One should frequently press the corners of the eyes near the nose with the hands, holding the breath while doing so. Cease when the qi flows through, then exhale and repeat. With constant practice, one gains the ability to perceive the hidden and distant.

Master Yang, when awakening at night, would always knock his teeth seven times and swallow saliva nine times. Upon completion, he would press the sides of his nose with his hands, moving left and right, up and down, counting to ten repetitions. He would softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme High’s Four Luminaries, the Nine Gates radiate brilliance.
The two eyes, dark and penetrating, connect with the true and reach the numinous.
The Mysterious Terrace in Heaven, flowing qi harmonized and balanced.
The Cloud Maiden’s graceful bearing, the eye-child’s keen clarity.
Flowering wisdom, bright and resplendent, a hundred visions clear and distant.
Preserving harmony in the Upper Origin, wandering the Nine Citadels.
The five viscera take root, ears and eyes naturally arise.
The Heavenly Terrace, lush and pure, its beams and pillars unwavering.
The seven po refined and tempered, the three hun at peace.
The Red Child seizes the radiance, ever at my side.
Should any dare obstruct my ears and eyes, the Supreme High shall crush them with flowing bells.
Ten thousand evils vanish, all wishes fulfilled.
Sun and moon guard the gates, the heart harbors the five stars.
The True Sovereign’s invocation, all echoes heed with reverence."*

Upon awakening, recite this without fail. It grants the face a youthful countenance, restrains the po and records the hun, repels a thousand demons, and causes the seven apertures to flow freely, the complexion blooming like the flower of Shun. This is the wondrous Dao of the perfected being’s daily practice.

Upon completion, swallow saliva nine times. The Red Child of Stone Radiance constantly rubs the mouth and nose, then the eyes. Over time, the hands generate fluid, which is then used to rub the eyes. Daily practice makes the body fragrant and the form light.

The *Scripture of the Supreme High’s Flourishing Radiance* states: At the time of living qi, swallow saliva twice seven times. Upon completion, press the painful areas of the body, facing the direction of life, and recite the incantation:

*"Left Mysterious, Right Mysterious, the Three Spirits unite as one.
Left Yellow, Right Yellow, the Six Radiances align.
Wind-qi and malignant illnesses, subdued in the four directions.
Jade Maidens flow with grace, above and below freely coursing.
Internally dispatching water and fire, externally repelling misfortune.
Everlasting life and flying transcendence, the body ever at rest and strong."*

Upon completion of the recitation, swallow saliva twelve times, then swiftly press the afflicted area thirty times—thus shall illness and hernia never arise.

The *Scripture of Internal Radiance* states: Upon rising from bed, first wipe the chest and forehead with silk until warm, then stroke the head in the direction of the hair’s growth. After a long while, rub the face and eyes with both hands and swallow saliva thirty times. With prolonged practice, the eyes grow bright, noxious qi cannot enter, and the body remains forever at peace.

The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: When rising externally, sit upright and regulate the breath. Cover the head with both hands, gaze upward, and contend against the hands with force three or four times—this harmonizes essence and circulates blood, preventing wind-qi from entering. With long practice, one neither sickens nor ages.

Lady Li of Fangzhang, the Illustrious Spirit, says: Frequently press the ears on both sides to sharpen hearing. This is called "tending the city walls"—one must inscribe it in the register of the named scholars. Often press the sides of the nose to balance the qi. This is called "without haste, irrigate the Central Peak"—inscribe it in the Emperor’s records.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate* states: When combing the hair, face the direction of the ruler. At the first stroke, softly recite the incantation:
*"Mud-Pill Palace’s mysterious blossom, preserving essence ever abiding.
Right as the hidden moon, left as the sun’s root.
The Six Harmonies purified and refined—
the hundred spirits receive grace."*
Upon completion, swallow saliva three times. With regular practice, the hair does not fall but grows instead.

It further says: Frequently change the parting of the hair, combing often without causing pain. One may also have an attendant comb it—more is better. Thus the blood flows unimpeded, and the hair roots remain firm. Have the attendant wash their hands before combing, lest they defile the Celestial Palace.

The *True Reports* states: Combing the hair should be broad and frequent to circulate qi and blood and disperse wind-dampness. Changing the part often is even better—there is no need to loosen the hair. The *Scripture of the Cinnabar Landscape* says: Alternately rub the hair and comb it until warm. Also, alternately rub the arms with the hands to prevent the hair from whitening and the vessels from floating outward.

*Register of the Hidden and Eternal Diagram, Sixth Scroll*
The *True Reports* states: The Dao of long life requires eliminating illness, preventing harm to the body, and avoiding depletion of blood, brain, and marrow, as well as stagnation of fluids and filth. Without first removing illness, even the consumption of medicinal foods and the practice of qi-cultivation are of no benefit. There was once a woman of the Huangfu clan who loved the divine immortals and constantly absorbed the essence of the sun and moon. After thirty years, she felt no benefit. Later, she met the Perfected One of South Mountain Peak, who taught her: "You cannot ascend as an immortal because you have illness—your brain palace is deficient. Take medicine to dispel sickness and cultivate the practice." After eighteen years, she ascended in broad daylight.

The *Scripture of the Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations of the Supreme High* states: If one treads upon hidden chamber milk-blood, one must immediately bathe to dispel it. The method uses ten ounces of bamboo leaves and four ounces of white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of water until bubbling. Strain and bathe with the liquid, adjusting the temperature—thus all filth is dissolved. This not only removes impurity but deeply prevents warm impediment, sores, and itching. When celestial beings descend to wander below and return to the upper realms, they invariably use this water to dispel impurity.

Master Shen Yi’s oral instructions say: When ingesting divine medicine, do not face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit, lest essence scatter, qi disorder, and lifespan be harmed, rendering the medicine’s power as dust. The *Oral Instructions of the Yellow Mountain Lord* state: When taking medicinal substances, avoid eating garlic, pomegranate seeds, pig’s liver, and dog’s head. For every catty consumed, one’s lifespan is reduced by a hundred days—beware of this.

The Director of Destiny of Shuqing says: When ingesting immortal medicines, always face the direction of your life destiny. Upon completion, do not speak of death or inauspicious matters, lest you offend the fetal spirit and render the medicine useless. The Ninth Radiance’s Peaceful Consort says: When about to eat, do not speak of ugly matters. When bathing, constantly visualize the Six Ding spirits to fulfill your wishes. The *Book of Rites* also says: "Do not desire [to speak of] such things when eating"—there is good reason for this. It further says: Do not leave food exposed, lest various noxious qi gather. Many have fallen ill or faced incurable conditions due to fondness for food—truly, the harm of exposed food is real. "Exposed food" refers to food that is not properly covered.

*Seventh Scroll: Cultivating True Qi in Seclusion*
The Left Consort of Purple Tenuity’s *Admonitory Writings* states: The ears and eyes are the ladder rungs for seeking the Perfected—success or failure depends on them. How can they be treated lightly? Press the small cavities behind both eyebrows twenty-seven times, then rub the temples with the hands and rotate the ears thirty times. The rubbing should be done without fixed timing. Upon completion, sweep the forehead with the hands twenty-seven times, beginning between the eyebrows and moving upward into the hairline. Then swallow saliva, in no fixed amount. With regular practice, the ears and eyes grow bright, and within a year, one can read at night. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum without revealing the method.

It further says: The small cavities behind the eyebrows are the palace of the Upper Prime and Six Harmonies. When the eyes’ radiance is harmonious and lustrous, the essence-light shines like a pearl, ever youthful—this is the supreme Dao of the Perfected One’s sitting and rising. The *Internal Scripture of the Perfected One’s Constant Abode* states: If you wish to read at night, cultivate the Constant Abode. The reason the Perfected One can see in all four directions, the eight reaches, and even the palm of the hand is the principle of the Constant Abode.

It further says: Beneath the canopy of flowering brilliance, extend harmony to the celestial Perfected. Entering the valley’s ravine, fill the source of the Celestial Mountain—thus the empty and numinous can see the myriad ghosts, and the machinations of the wicked are extinguished. Above, harmonize with the celestial Perfected; below, press the mountain’s source. The "mountain source" is the high point at the initial entry of the nostrils. The "celestial Perfected" is the space between the eyebrows, at the corners of the brows. The "mountain source" is the root of the philtrum below the nose. The "ravine" is the small valley slightly within the nose. The "Flowery Court" lies below the two eyebrows—it is the bridge for penetrating vision. The "Celestial Perfected" is the upper chamber for drawing in the numinous. Morning and evening, constantly swallow saliva twenty-seven times and press these points with the hands—this is the Dao of attaining numinous clarity, seeing through all, and blocking the myriad evils.

The incantation states:
"Open the celestial court, grant me eternal life.
See through ten thousand miles, let soul and spirit return to infancy.
Banish ghosts and expel evil, summon a thousand numinous beings.
Ascend to the Great Clarity, merge with the sun.
Attain the rank of Perfected, inscribe your name in the mysterious register."

*Essential Methods for Cultivating Perfection*, Chapter Eight:
Those who study the Dao must first restrain and regulate soul and spirit, eliminate the ghostly corpse. On the days of the new and full moon, the Gengshen day, and the Jiayin day, one should purify the heart, bathe, sit upright on a mat, and remain awake—this is even better. With cinnabar brush, mark the left eye below the outer canthus; with realgar brush, mark the right side below the nose, allowing it to slightly enter the valley. After marking, first knock the teeth three times and softly recite the incantation:
"Lofty scenes fly in mystery, cinnabar and realgar disperse mist.
Qi seizes the insubstantial evil, corpse-filth sinks and vanishes.
Harmonize the hun-soul, refine the po-spirit, elevate the form to merge with the Perfected.
Grant me immortality, eternal preservation of myriad years,
keen insight and penetrating vision, enduring prosperity and smooth passage."
After reciting, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and press with the third finger of the right hand below the right nostril, and with the second finger of the left hand pinch below the left eye, each seven times until complete. Pressing these two places in secret seals the gates through which the seven po-spirits and wandering corpse roam. They are the bridges through which iron essence and malevolent spirits invade, thus receiving the essence of cinnabar and realgar to block the paths of corpse-ghosts. This is the supreme method of the Great Ultimate. Practicing it constantly harmonizes and softens the hun and po, scatters and severs corpse-filth, and leads to long life and transcendence as a divine immortal.

The Purple Void Primordial Lady states: On the fourth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the fifteenth day of the third month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the second day of the twelfth month—on these days, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord ascends the Jade Cloud Forest Chamber of the mountain, surveying the four directions of the world. Those with aspirations for distant journeys should, on these days before sunrise, face north and bow twice, stating their intentions, swallowing saliva thirty-six times, and all wishes will be granted.

The Ninth Radiance Peaceful Consort states: When entering a quiet chamber, first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot to align with it. In walking, proceed as if presenting a report to a superior, ensuring it reaches the ears above.

*Essential Methods for Cultivating Perfection* states: On the five Mao days, one should purify the heart, enter the chamber facing east, mentally visualize bowing and invoking the spirits, regulate the breath to greet and sense the divine luminaries. Whatever is expressed with sincerity will be granted. Those who persist in this will have Jade Maidens descend to attend them. It also states: On one’s birth day, face east, knock the teeth three times, mentally visualize bowing twice, and softly recite the incantation:
"Great One, guard life, the three qi merge with the Perfected.
The chamber’s womb holds the lofty scene, mother mysterious and father primordial.
You gave birth to my five viscera, gathered my essence and spirit.
Below, irrigate the Jade Flower; to the left, smile at the Golden Dawn.
Grant me divine transcendence, command spirits and employ the numinous.
Constantly preserve the smooth passage, soaring through the ten heavens."
After reciting, mentally bow to the four directions, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called the Supreme Method of the Hidden Morning Audience for the Embryonic Origin. Practicing it constantly secures the hun and po, leading to long life and transcendence as a divine immortal.

It also states: On Jiazi days and the first day of the month, one should bathe to attain spiritual communion. It further states: On the eight seasonal nodes, one should purify the heart, speak only of good deeds, and be vigilant against anger or the exercise of punitive authority—these are great taboos for heaven and humanity. Be cautious and auspicious.

*The Scripture of the Great Elixir of Perfection* states: On the second day of the second month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the tenth day of the tenth month at night, within the bedchamber, visualize the secrets of the Grotto-Heaven. Remaining awake is auspicious. That evening, the Jade Maidens of the Protective Scriptures, bearing the Great Ultimate’s canonical prohibitions, will observe you from the void. On that night, burn incense and maintain reverent focus as if awaiting something. Sit outside, visualize, or read scriptures, concentrating on the Perfected within your thoughts. Do not engage in other affairs. Over time, you will be received by masters and friends, ascending to heaven.

It also states: When activating the furnace, do not look back, for doing so misleads the assembled Perfected and causes true qi to invite demonic responses. The Perfected of the Great Ultimate who recite the *Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* ten thousand times will be welcomed by cloud chariots and attain long life.

The Perfected Meng Deran states: Before sleeping at night, first recite the *Inner Radiance Scripture of the Yellow Court* once to pacify the hun and po. Practicing this for ten years leads to long life and transcendence as a divine immortal.

The Lady Jiang of the Northern Peak states: Reciting this scripture also keeps one free from illness—it is the Way of not dying.

Here ends the *Red Writ for Prolonging Life by the Lofty Perfected of the Supreme Mystery*.
