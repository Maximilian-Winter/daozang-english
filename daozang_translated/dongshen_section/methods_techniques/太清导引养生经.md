### **The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Guiding and Nurturing Life**
**Cautious Practice of Internal Methods**

**Chisongzi** was the Rain Master during the time of Shennong. He could ascend and descend with the wind and remained alive until the era of Gaoxin. His daily practice began at dawn: he would spread a mat facing east, first interlock his hands above his head, and pull his head to the ground, performing five *weng* breaths and five exhalations to dispel bloating and qi.

Next, he would cover his head with his right hand while pressing his left elbow to the ground, stretching fully, then reverse the motion—covering with the left hand and pressing the right elbow to the ground—five times each, exhaling to cease, thus guiding the sinews and bones.

Then, placing both hands on his right knee and lifting to the waist, he would raise his head after extreme stretching, pausing for five breaths to guide the waist.

Next, his left hand would press his waist and left knee while his right hand stretched upward, then reversing—right hand on waist and right knee, left hand stretching upward—each for five breaths to guide the heart and abdomen.

Then, his left hand would press his waist while his right hand stretched upward, reversing the motion with the right hand on the waist and left hand stretching upward, five breaths each, to guide the center of the abdomen.

Next, interlocking his hands before his chest and ribs, he would shake his head left and right without ceasing until fully extended, thus guiding the face and ears to prevent perverse qi from entering.

Then, placing both hands below his waist, he would sway left and right until fully extended, circulating the blood and vessels.

Next, interlocking his hands, he would stretch fully, pulling left and right at the shoulders.

Then, interlocking his hands and reversing them above his head, he would adjust left and right to guide the lungs and liver.

Next, interlocking his hands before his chest, he would stretch fully left and right to expel vexing qi from the skin.

Then, interlocking his hands left and right, he would lift his shoulders to guide the skin, standing and swaying to pull the two channels, dispelling leg qi.

The above is **Chisongzi’s Method of Guiding**, which eliminates the hundred diseases, prolongs life, and augments longevity. This should be practiced daily over time for benefit.

**Master Ning** was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. As a pottery master, he could accumulate fire to burn himself and ascend or descend with the smoke, his clothes never scorched. His practice began between midnight and noon: facing east with unbound hair, he would clench his fists and hold his breath for one cycle, then raise his hands to guide left and right. Covering his ears with his hands prevented his hair from turning white. External guiding was performed three times, pressing the vessels beside his neck with his fingers three times to brighten his eyes.

Facing east while seated, he would hold his breath for two cycles, then press his mouth with his middle fingers, spitting saliva fourteen times, rubbing and wiping his eyes to brighten them.

Master Xiao said: Those who wish to practice Dao-yin and circulate qi to eliminate the hundred diseases and prevent aging should always keep in mind the returning cinnabar to the cinnabar field. The cinnabar that gives life to humans is the returning that saves them; when complete, it extends years, when lost, it leads to decay. Therefore, Dao-yin expels all perverse qi from the limbs, bones, and joints, preserving the upright qi. Those who practice with sincerity and diligence, integrating it into their daily actions and speech, practicing day and night, will strengthen their bones and joints, curing the hundred diseases. If suddenly afflicted by wind stroke, chronic malaria, paralysis, deafness, head convulsions, coughing with counterflow qi, or lumbar pain, one may consult the illustrations, locate the ailment, circulate qi, and practice Dao-yin, using intention to expel and eliminate it. Circulating qi can supplement the internal, while Dao-yin can cure the four limbs. This is the natural Dao; only through diligent practice can one preserve harmony with heaven and earth.

**Pengzu’s External Qi-Circulation Method:**
Pengzu was a minister of the Yin dynasty, living through the Xia and Shang, numbering seven hundred years. He regularly consumed cassia and attained the Dao. He often removed his clothing and coverings, stretched his waist, filled his lower abdomen, and held his breath for five cycles to guide the kidneys, curing wasting-thirst and benefiting yin and yang.

He also said: Extend the left leg, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the spleen, curing cold and heat in the heart and abdomen, and chest distension.

Pull the toes of both feet for five cycles to guide the abdomen, curing mounting and conglomerations, and benefiting the nine orifices.

Turn the soles of both feet inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the heart and lungs, curing coughing with counterflow qi.

Bring the heels inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the thighs, dispelling qi from the five collaterals, benefiting the intestines and stomach, and expelling pathogenic qi.

Cover the left meridian, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the lungs, dispelling wind and deficiency, and brightening the eyes.

Stretch the meridians and pull the toes of both feet for five cycles to prevent cramps.

Pull both knees with the hands and place them on the chest for five cycles to cure lumbar pain.

Rotate both feet outward ten times, then inward ten times, ceasing to restore from all fatigue.

The external guiding method of Pengzu’s Valley Immortal dispels the hundred diseases and is essential for prolonging life and preserving health.

In all, ten movements and fifty breaths—five times fifty makes two hundred and fifty breaths.

For Daoist guiding, practice regularly from midnight to the crowing of the pheasant at dawn, avoiding full meals and bathing.

The Eight Spirit Daoist Guiding Method of Prince Qiao prolongs life, benefits longevity, and dispels the hundred diseases. The method states: The pillow should be four inches high, the feet five inches apart, and the hands three inches from the body. Remove clothing and unbound hair, lie flat on the back, and empty the mind of all thoughts. Calm the intent, then slowly inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, directing the breath to each organ in turn, repeating the cycle without end. To rest, first exhale fully and cease, without forcing prolonged breaths. With long practice, the breath will naturally lengthen. Let the coming and going of qi be so subtle that neither ear nor nose perceives it. Refine and concentrate it, then extend it gradually. The thighs and calves should remain still, with moderation prized. Whether faintly present or absent, perform this a hundred times. When the abdomen moves and qi resonates, and an external sound is heard in the feet, success is achieved. For those who attain success, what illness remains?

The throat resembles a silver ring, twelve layers thick, striking the chest to reach the lungs. Their color is white and lustrous, the front two lobes higher and the rear two lower. The heart strikes beneath them, broad above and tapering below, its crimson hue like a lotus bud yet to open, inverted and attached to the lungs. The liver connects below, its color a true green, like the head of a turtle dove. Its six lobes embrace the stomach, the front two higher and the rear four lower. The gallbladder connects beneath, resembling a green silk pouch. The spleen lies at the center, its golden-yellow hue gleaming like molten metal. The kidneys resemble two crouching rats, flanking the spine and aligned with the navel, desiring elevation. Their color is a true black, enveloped in fat and vessels, their white and black distinct. The stomach resembles a plain sack; envision its folds curving to the right, free from filth and decay.

The liver stores the hun-soul, the lungs store the po-soul, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores the intent, and the kidneys store essence—these are called the abodes of the spirits. When the abodes of the spirits are cultivated, the hundred vessels harmonize, and pathogenic diseases have no place to reside.

The small intestine is nine feet long, corresponding to the nine provinces. Another account says nine lands. The large intestine is twenty-four feet long.

For all Daoist guiding: those with deficiency should close their eyes, while those with excess should keep them open. Perform the guiding for the afflicted area without using the seventh breath. Move slowly back and forth for about two hundred steps, then sit and swallow qi five or six times. If the condition does not improve, repeat the method until cured.

For all ailments, lie flat on the back, unbound hair as prescribed, and slowly inhale through the mouth to fill the abdomen. Exert to the utmost until breath is nearly cut off, then slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat dozens of times. For deficiency, supplement; for excess, drain. Close the mouth, warm the qi, and swallow it thirty times. When the abdomen rumbles, cease. Walk back and forth for two hundred steps. If not cured, repeat the method.

For ailments in the throat or chest, raise the pillow seven inches. For ailments below the heart, raise the pillow four inches. For ailments below the navel, remove the pillow. Inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the nose is called *supplementing*; closing the mouth, warming the qi, and swallowing it is called *draining*.

Method for treating all diseases by breath-holding:
To guide ailments of the head, tilt the head back.
To guide ailments of the waist and feet, point the toes upward.
To guide ailments of the chest, pull the toes.
To guide ailments of the arms, cover the arms.
To dispel cold, heat, or discomfort in the abdomen, or if afflicted by cold with fever, hold the breath and distend the abdomen. When needing to breathe, exhale slowly through the nose. Repeat until cured.

1. Sit upright, straighten the waist, legs, and arms, place hands palms-down on the ground, and slowly inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel pain in the chest and lungs. Warm the qi by swallowing, and close the eyes.

7. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the body, extend both arms, and turn the palms upward. Inhale through the nose and hold the breath to the utmost for seven cycles, ceasing when pain arises in the center. This is called the Terrace of the King of Shu, dispelling accumulations below the rib-side.

8. Lie face-down without a pillow, stand on both feet, inhale through the nose sixteen times, then exhale through the nose, ensuring the breath enters subtly.

When the breath reaches the center, ensure the nose does not perceive it, dispelling heat within the body and pain in the back.

9. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the left hand with the palm facing upward, and withdraw the right hand, dispelling pain and knotted qi in both arms.

10. Sit upright, clasp the hands together and hold the knees, hold the breath to distend the abdomen for fourteen or twenty-one cycles, then exhale when the qi is full, ensuring all qi flows smoothly. Practicing this for ten years, the old will retain a youthful appearance.

19. When the body feels dull and obstructed, perform Dao-yin: clasp the head with both hands and turn it up and down, called "Opening the Rib-Side."

20. Squat and extend the right foot, clasp the left knee with both hands, straighten the waist, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling difficulty in bending, stretching, bowing, or rising, pain in the brain, and stagnant numbness.

21. Squat and extend the left foot, clasp the right knee with both hands, straighten the waist, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, then extend the left foot outward, dispelling difficulty in bending, stretching, bowing, or rising, and pain in the brain. Another version states it dispels wind, dim vision, and deafness.

22. Lie flat on the back, straighten both feet, rub the perineum with both hands until it reddens like cinnabar wrapped in oil, dispelling dampness below the genitals, difficulty in urination, sagging, and heaviness in the lower abdomen.

If there is heat in the abdomen, simply inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose dozens of times, without swallowing the qi. If the abdomen is not hot, hold the breath for seven cycles to warm the qi, then swallow it ten times.

23. Squat, clasp both knees with both hands, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling numbness in the waist and pain in the back.

*Wang Qiao’s Dao-yin Diagram* is found within Peng Zu’s methods:
For seven days, extend the left foot, bend the right knee, press inward with it, hold for five breaths, drawing the spleen qi, dispelling cold and heat in the heart and abdomen, and distension in the chest.

*Peng Zu’s Dao-yin Diagram*:
Perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, loosen the hair, sit facing east, make fists, hold the breath for one cycle, raise the hands to guide left and right, cover the ears with the hands, tap the neck arteries with the fingers five times. This brightens the eyes, blackens the hair, and prevents it from turning white, treating head wind.

*Method for Purging Qi*:
The method states: Every person’s five viscera each have their own qi. When externally closing the breath and sensing afterward, those who wish to ingest qi should first purge and turn over the old food and stale qi to expel them, then regulate and ingest the qi.

Here is the translation:

---

Its method: Clench the fists tightly, raise both hands and press them against the space between the breasts, lift the knees to brace the back and body. Internally close the breath, inflate the qi in the *qi* sea, allowing it to emerge naturally from within. Turn and revolve it, then exhale with a *he* sound. Stop after one or two sets of nine. This completes the purging of qi, after which it is regulated.

Perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, sit facing east, hold the breath for four cycles, and tap the teeth fourteen times to cure tooth decay and pain. Some say it treats bleeding gums without decay.

*Method for Swallowing Qi*:
All people receive the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth to sustain life. With each swallow and exhalation, the internal qi harmonizes with the external qi. From the *qi* sea, it rises with the breath to the throat. At the moment of full exhalation, seal the mouth, swallow with a rolling motion, and force it down with a gurgling sound. It then descends along the left side through twenty-four nodes, like water flowing through rapids, distinctly audible. For women, it descends along the right side. Thus, the internal qi is consolidated, clearly differentiated. Guide it with intention, massage it with the hands, and hasten its descent into the *qi* sea. The *qi* sea is located three inches below the navel, also called the lower *dantian*. For beginners in qi ingestion, if the upper burner is not yet unblocked, massage to assist its swift descent. Once the qi flows freely, it descends without massage. With the mouth closed, swallow twice in succession—this is called "cloud travel." A moist swallow, mixing saliva with the qi, is called "rain bestowal." When ingesting qi internally, if the qi has not yet circulated day and night, perform this with each swallow. Do not hastily progress to consecutive swallows. After three years of practice, success is achieved.

Perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, stand upright against a wall, hold the breath, and circulate qi from the head to the feet to cure carbuncles, scabs, *da feng*, hemiplegia, and all convulsions. Some say circulate qi from the feet upward to the head.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: First lie supine, close the mouth, and inflate the cheeks and abdomen until the mouth is full of qi. Swallow, directing the intention to guide it backward. Practice this morning and evening—it is wondrous.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Squat in a corner, clasp the knees with both hands, lower the head, and hold the breath for nine cycles to cure neck pain and lumbar or leg ailments. Some say it treats fatigue, with other effects the same.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Extend both arms left and right, hold the breath for nine cycles to cure arm pain, fatigue wind, unregulated qi, and blockages.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, face the sky, and exhale the qi of wine, food, drunkenness, or fullness to dispel hunger and sober the mind. This is suitable for summer practice, preventing cold and restlessness.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, inhale through the nose, guide the qi down to the navel, and exhale slowly through the mouth without holding the breath to dissolve accumulations. This is suitable for those who prefer heat in summer.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Lower the head slightly, hold a gentle breath, clasp the hands left and right, and hold the breath for twelve cycles to aid digestion, lighten the body, boost vitality, and prevent pathogenic qi from entering. Alternatively, perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, or circulate qi while lowering the head and squatting, binding oneself with a rope. Lower the head and hold the breath for ten cycles to aid digestion and lighten the body.

Perform Dao-yin: Regularly press outward with both hands as if lifting a thousand *jin* stone, alternating left and right. Practicing this throughout life prevents illness.

Perform Dao-yin: Place both hands on the ground, retract the body, arch the spine, and lift upward three times. Practicing this daily brings supplementation, benefit, and longevity. When performing this, avoid wind, hold the breath, and after each ingestion, exhale without letting the ears hear. If fatigued, use swallowing and exhalation. For cold in the viscera, blow out the qi; for heat, exhale it out.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Imitate the movement of a snake, hold the breath, lie supine, then rise and squat. Face the direction of the prevailing phase (*wang xiang*), hold the breath, eat lightly to ensure smoothness. Ingesting qi is the foundation, saliva is the broth. In spring, release; in winter, store. The *Hua Chi* and *Yu Jiang* are sweet as dates. Strive to practice without doubt. Another version says: In spring, generate; in summer, nourish; in winter, gather and store internally. Close the eyes to inner light—other details are the same.

*Method for Exhaling Qi*:
For those contemplating qi, *he* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough qi, or all pathogenic qi, use *he* to cure it. For great heat, open the mouth wide; for slight heat, open it slightly. Adjust according to need, but excessive practice will cause harm.

For those contemplating qi, *hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace of Earth. For mild heat, abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnant qi, use *hu* to cure it.

For those contemplating qi, *xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes. For red, swollen eyes, use *xu* to cure them.

For those contemplating qi, *chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For cold in the waist and knees or decline of the yang path, use *chui* to cure it.

For those contemplating qi, *si* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose. For disharmony of cold and heat, use *si* to cure it.

*He*, *si*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*—each of the five viscera governs one qi. For extreme fatigue, follow these principles to achieve immediate relief.

The method of Dao-yin: The outer mat should be elevated to prevent earth qi from rising and ghostly qi from interfering.

The method of Dao-yin: Avoid impatience and haste, which are thieves to the body.

The method of Dao-yin: Do not face north, as it reverses the spirit. Violating this brings harm. For all matters, do not speak. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit facing north, as it diminishes lifespan.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the *Si Ming*, with two people alternating left and right turns, constantly visualizing its presence.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the divine radiance of yellow and the bright moon beside you, visible day and night.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the forms, qi, and colors of the five viscera circulating throughout the body.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the colored spirits of the five viscera in their respective places. From this point onward, the human form is entirely governed by the five phases.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the five viscera transforming into dragons and fish.

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate essence within the navel, with kidney qi as bright red and white, ascending from the back to the head and descending to meet the body—this is called "returning essence."

Perform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the heart as a fire the size of a dou, dispelling malign qi.
