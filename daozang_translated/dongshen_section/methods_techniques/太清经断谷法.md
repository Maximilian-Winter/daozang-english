**The *Taiqing Jing* Method of Grain Abstention**

**Text Title:** *Taiqing Jing* Method of Grain Abstention. Author unknown. Likely a pre-Tang or early Tang dynasty work. One scroll. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* Section, Methods Category.

**Method of Consuming Pine Roots**
Take the roots of a pine tree growing eastward, peel off the white bark, chop finely, dry in the sun, and pound into powder. Consume to satiety to abstain from grains. When thirsty, drink water.

**Method of Consuming Poria (Fuling)**
Remove the black skin of poria, pound into powder, and soak thoroughly in pure wine within an earthenware vessel. Cover with another earthenware vessel, seal tightly, and leave for fifteen days before opening. It will then resemble a chewable food. Consume three times daily, like a game piece, or take a square-inch spoonful in powdered form. This dispels hunger and thirst, eliminates illness, and prolongs life.

**Another Method**
Grind one *jin* each of poria and cinnamon bark into powder, mix with white honey, and form into pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk. Take three times daily. This is Zhang Chang’s method for transcending the world.

**Another Method**
Three *jin* of poria powder, two *jin* of white wax, three *jin* of hempseed oil, one *jin* of pine resin, and one *dou* of white honey. First boil the honey three to five times, then add pine resin until it boils, followed by oil until it boils, then wax until it boils. Finally, add the poria powder and stir thoroughly. Form into pills the size of plum pits. Take one pill daily, or twice daily, to attain a thousand years without hunger.

**Another Method**
Three *sheng* of poria powder, five *jin* of white wax, and three *jin* of white honey. Steam together until cooked like one *shi* of rice, then pour into a vessel and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills at a time; if hungry, take another ten. After a hundred days, hunger ceases, and one pill daily suffices. Avoid other foods.

Alternatively, extract juice from cogon grass roots, mix with this medicine, and steam. After a hundred days of consumption, the Jade Maiden will appear.

**Another Method**
Five *sheng* of poria powder, seven *jin* of oil pine resin, five *jin* of white wax, three *jin* of white honey, and two *sheng* of Sichuan perilla. Steam together until cooked like one *shi* of rice, then remove and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills initially, gradually increasing until hunger subsides. After ten days, take one pill daily. Refrain from other foods, but a little wine may be consumed. This is the method used by Master Cifa, who administered it in Chengdu. Many Daoists and laypeople benefited, and those who practiced the Dao or attended lectures could thereby transcend the world.

From the *Scripture of the Five Talismans*.

**Another Method**

First, take six *dou* of water and boil four *dou* of white rice until cooked. Strain the dregs to yield four *dou* and five *sheng*, then place it in a non-porous vessel. Clarify it thoroughly, then finely grind five *jin* of small wheat grains and add them to the vessel, steaming them again after soaking overnight. Add five *sheng* of glutinous rice while the mixture is still warm, allowing it to ferment for two or three nights until fragrant. Then steam two *sheng* of *lin* rice and add it, letting it sit for one or two nights. Add one *sheng* of fine honey and stir evenly. Next, take five *jin* of finely sifted, high-quality poria and place it in a loose silk bag, submerging it in the liquid without letting it touch the bottom. Knead the bag by hand to ensure the liquid thoroughly permeates it. Seal the vessel with clay for twenty-one days, then remove the contents.

On the day before consumption, prepare fine food and maintain purity through fasting and abstention. The following morning, consume a portion the size of a pellet, finishing one *jin* by evening. Children may take half a *jin*. Thereafter, one will never suffer hunger or thirst. Drink only cool water, never warm. If grains are consumed, the effects of the medicine will immediately dissipate. From this point onward, take two pellets at midday, increasing to three at most. This wine must not be consumed casually—indeed, all wine is forbidden in this practice. This method is most effective for grain avoidance, and with prolonged use, divine spirits will descend to transmit their teachings.

When consuming poria, strictly avoid sour or heating foods.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of *weimao* wood, wash and pound it thoroughly. Soak it in two *shi* of water overnight, then boil until half the liquid remains. Add five *sheng* of clear wine and boil again, reducing it to one *shi*. Strain the dregs and simmer over a low flame. Add two *sheng* of soybean powder and one *sheng* of asparagus root powder, then form into pellets the size of pellets. Take three pellets at dawn, once daily. For those dwelling in mountains or traveling long distances, this serves as a substitute for food, resisting wind and cold while prolonging life and preventing illness. This is the method used by Cui Yazi, where asparagus root is prepared by removing its core and skin.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of *weimao* wood and one *shi* of water, boiling it while gradually adding more water until three *shi* have been used and the wood is thoroughly softened. Strain the dregs and simmer the liquid in a bronze vessel. Form soybean powder into cakes two *cun* in diameter. Consume three cakes daily, holding them in the mouth until dissolved—do not swallow them whole. This will enable grain avoidance and longevity.

**Another Method**
Take two *shi* of *weimao* wood and boil it in three *shi* of water, gradually adding more until ten *shi* and five *dou* of liquid remain. Strain the dregs and place the liquid in a bronze vessel. Add five *sheng* of white honey, five *jin* of pine resin, and five *jin* of jujube paste, then simmer over a low flame until thickened. Consume one pellet the size of a chicken’s egg, three times daily. This will eliminate hunger, cure all illnesses, and grant longevity. The pine resin must be fully refined.

Take one *shi* of wood, break it into pieces, and place it in a cauldron. Boil until the liquid rises three times, then strain the decoction. Add two *shi* of water and boil thoroughly until softened. Combine with the previous decoction, then add one *sheng* of finely ground broomcorn millet and five *sheng* of white honey. Simmer over a low flame until thickened. Consume two cakes daily as usual—this will eliminate hunger, preserve vitality, and grant longevity.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of wood, break it into pieces, and boil in two *shi* of water until reduced. Add one *shi* of water and boil daily until thoroughly softened. Strain the dregs, then simmer further. Add three *sheng* of rice flour, one *sheng* of malt sugar, and half a *sheng* of fermented soybeans. Cook the rice until done, then transfer to a bronze vessel. Warm over a husk fire until pliable enough to form cakes, each weighing four *liang*. Initially, consume two cakes; when hunger returns, eat five cakes at once. After five days, reduce to four cakes; after ten days, reduce to three; after one month, reduce to two. Thereafter, one may go a year without further eating, eliminating hunger and attaining longevity.

**Another Method**
Take five *jin* of *zhu* (Atractylodes), pound and press to extract the juice, then mix with three *jin* of ground *fuling* (Poria). Form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Swallow three pills at midday and three in the evening—this will eliminate hunger and aging. With prolonged use, the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits will arrive, and one may command them.

**Another Method**
Steep wood shavings in wine, then steam and dry in the sun. Repeat this process nine times. Consume three *fangcunbi* daily—this will eliminate hunger and extend lifespan. The wood is best gathered in the eleventh, twelfth, first, or second lunar months.

When consuming *zhu* (Atractylodes), avoid eating peaches. Also consume *huangjing* (Polygonatum).

**Method for Polygonatum (Huangjing)**
Finely chop one *shi* of *huangjing* (Polygonatum), then boil with two *shi* five *sheng* of water (some say six *shi*). Simmer over low heat from morning to evening until tender. Remove and cool, then crush by hand. Place in a cloth bag and press to extract the juice. Decoct the liquid, sun-dry the residue, and grind into powder. Combine with the decocted liquid in a cauldron and simmer until it can be formed into pills the size of chicken eggs. Take one pill three times daily to eliminate grain consumption, cure all illnesses, and attain a light, vigorous body free from aging. Consume modestly and regularly—excess or abrupt cessation is unnecessary. If thirsty, drink water. This formula is considered the finest, recorded in *The Five Talismans*.

**Another Method**
Press *huangjing* to extract three *sheng* of juice. If insufficient, add water and press again. Combine with three *sheng* each of fresh *dihuang* (Rehmannia) juice and *tianmendong* (Asparagus) juice, then simmer over low heat until reduced by half. Add five *jin* of white honey and continue simmering until it can be formed into pills. Take pills the size of a bullet thrice daily to banish hunger and enhance complexion. Alternatively, press to extract three *sheng* of juice and simmer over a water bath until pliable for pill-making. Consume one pill the size of a chicken egg twice daily—after thirty days, one will no longer feel hunger and may run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Remove the heart and skin of *tianmendong* before use.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of *huangjing* roots, wash and scrape clean, then boil in two *shi* of water. Add five *sheng* of wine and continue boiling until the flavor is fully extracted. Press to obtain the juice and store it tightly. Further boil the residue until tender, press again, and combine the two juices. Clarify and retain the finest portion, then place in a copper vessel over a water bath and simmer until it resembles malt sugar. Roast soybeans and grind into powder, then form into pills with the syrup. Take one pill the size of a chicken egg thrice daily to eliminate hunger. After a hundred days, one may run as fast as a galloping horse. Alternatively, roasted sesame may replace soybeans, or rice may be added to create a fragrant, hunger-suppressing gruel. This method is also recorded in *The Five Talismans*. Harvest *huangjing* in winter or the second and third lunar months of spring for best results. When consuming *huangjing*, avoid eating plums and similar fruits.

**Method for Solomon’s Seal (Weiluo)**
Gather the leaves in the second and ninth lunar months, chop, dry, and process. Take one *fangcunbi* thrice daily. Alternatively, prepare as a confection following the *huangjing* method. This guides the flow of *qi* and vessels, strengthens sinews and bones, treats wind-stroke, relaxes contracted sinews and knotted flesh, smooths facial wrinkles, and enhances complexion. Prolonged use bestows longevity and transcendence.

**Method for Asparagus (Tianmendong)**
Grind ten *jin* of dried *tianmendong* and one *sheng* of apricot kernels into powder, then mix with honey. Take one *fangcunbi* thrice daily and once at night. This was consumed by Gan Shi and is called "Immortal’s Provisions."

**Another Method**
Take three *shi* of *tianmendong*, remove the heart and skin, then press to extract one *shi* of juice.

Gently simmer over low heat until reduced to five *sheng*, then skim off the froth floating on the surface. Add one *sheng* of white honey and two *sheng* of toasted sesame seed powder, blending and stirring continuously until the mixture can be formed into pills. Shape into cakes with powdered *doujuan* (soybean sprouts), each three *cun* in diameter and half a *cun* thick. Consume one cake daily; after a hundred days, hunger ceases, the flesh becomes supple and lustrous, and life is prolonged. Alternatively, add three *sheng* of rehmannia juice and simmer together. This formula is said to be the finest, recorded in *The Five Talismans*.

**Another Method**
Peel *tianmendong*, steam thoroughly, then press and place in a cauldron. Simmer over low heat, adding one-quarter part powdered soybeans, and blend until it can be formed into cakes. Consume three cakes the size of chicken eggs to sate hunger and enhance complexion. The best time for harvest is the second and eighth lunar months. When consuming *tianmendong*, avoid carp.

**Method for Giant Sesame (Husheng)**
Select plump, black sesame seeds in any quantity. Winnow and clean, then steam until thoroughly heated—about the time it takes to cook a meal—before removing and sun-drying. The next day, steam and dry again. Repeat this process nine times. Alternatively, under strong sunlight, steam and dry three times a day for three days, totaling nine cycles, until fully desiccated. Lightly moisten with water in a mortar, pound, then dry again in the sun. Winnow to remove the husks, toast until fragrant, and swiftly grind into fine powder. Consume at will, two to three *sheng* daily. It may also be mixed with honey into pills the size of goose eggs, taking five daily. Alternatively, blend with malt syrup or dissolve in wine. Gradual consumption eliminates all illness within a hundred days; after a year, the skin becomes smooth and lustrous, impervious to water. After five years, one is immune to harm from water or fire and can run as swiftly as a galloping horse.

*Baopuzi* states: "This formula was originally unknown east of the Yangtze. During the Yong’an reign of Emperor Hui (Year Jiazi), it was obtained amid the chaos in Luoyang. I, residing in seclusion on the first day of the eighth month in the second year of Yongxing, deemed it a vital secret."

**Another Method**

Take nine-times-steamed [grain] measuring one *shi*, add three *jin* of *fuling* (Poria cocos), and form into honeyed pills. Consume as above; the effects manifest swiftly.

**Another Method**
Take fully steamed [grain] measuring one *dou* and two *sheng*, twenty-four *liang* of *fuling*, and eight *liang* of *zexie* (Alisma orientalis). Grind thirty thousand strokes. Take doses the size of hazelnuts, three times daily. Alternatively, form into honeyed pills; these may be prepared in advance for military campaigns. When entering mountains or fording rivers, they prevent fatigue and emaciation, and one may eat whatever is available without restrictions or taboos.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of raw sesame seeds, remove the outer husks, steam for one day, dry in the sun, and grind. Pour one *shi* and five *sheng* of water into a cauldron, steam again until the water reduces by five *sheng*, then mix with cooked rice and spread onto a wooden tray, dousing thoroughly with hot water. Add one *sheng* of toasted wheat bran, stir into malt sugar, and promptly strain the liquid to boil it down to one-third its volume. Further reduce over a copper vessel in a water bath until it can be formed into pills. Consume pills the size of chicken eggs, three at a time. After a hundred days, the flesh becomes full and robust, and lifespan extends indefinitely. For those initially ravenous when first consuming sesame, prepare a single serving of plain rice porridge every five days, then gradually extend to ten days before another serving. Over time, this may cease entirely. When consuming sesame, avoid all foul or raw foods. If persistent diarrhea occurs, boil dried perilla leaves and drink the infusion.

**Miscellaneous Grains for Consumption**
Mix four *sheng* of rice with four *liang* of genuine musk, stirring thoroughly. Cook as one would a *shi* of rice, then eat to satiety; this sustains one for four years.

**Another Method**
Crush five thousand apricot kernels, extract approximately two *dou* of white juice, and boil down to eight or nine *sheng*. Soak one *sheng* (or up to five *sheng*) of rice—no more—then grind and steam until the steam rises. Add one *fen* of lead powder to the apricot juice, stir well, mix with the rice, and steam again until all liquid is absorbed, yielding a consistency like jujube paste. Prepare the rice the night before and consume the next day. This suffices for two people for a hundred days or one person for a year without hunger. To later purge the medicine, drink mallow soup.

**Another Method**
Take five *ge* each of polished rice, broomcorn millet, wheat, hemp seeds, and roasted soybeans, add one *jin* of white honey, and bring to a single boil. Form into pills the size of plums in cold water, then swallow them all at once to remain sated for life. One variant omits the broomcorn millet. Recorded in *The Five Talismans*.

**Another Method**

**Another Method**
Take one *sheng* of fine white rice and three *jin* of red halloysite. Mix them with water until fully submerged, then place in a warm location. After two or three days, a film will form on the surface. Pound this into pills the size of plums. Consume three pills daily to banish hunger and thirst. Drink water as needed to travel a thousand *li* without fatigue. Recorded in *The Five Talismans*.

**Another Method**
Soak one *shi* of polished rice in water for twenty-one days, then grind into powder and dry in the sun. Prepare as porridge: one *sheng* of powder yields three servings. Consuming this sustains one for a day, preserving strength, complexion, lightness of body, and clarity of vision.

**Another Method**
Take three *sheng* of finely ground barley, one *jin* of Sichuan perilla, and five *sheng* of hot water. Mix the perilla paste into the water, then soak the barley until saturated. Dry in the sun, lightly roast until fragrant, and repeat the soaking and drying until all liquid is absorbed. Grind finely, then add one *jin* each of licorice and wood shavings, two *jin* of poria powder, and one *sheng* of salt. Mix well and take two *fangcunbi* with water, three or four times daily. If thirsty, increase the dose to five *ge*. When encountering rice, vegetables, or other foods, consume them freely without restriction. In times of peril, famine, or hardship, this sustains life indefinitely, staving off hunger and prolonging years.

**Another Method**
Take one *shi* of barley and three *jin* of Sichuan perilla paste. Prepare four *sheng* of hot water, dissolve the paste in it, and consume after the initial full meal. Gradually increase intake to eliminate hunger, dispel cold and heat, and extend lifespan.

**Simple and Direct Method for Sustaining the Center**
Select three *sheng* of viable soybeans, rub them by hand until glossy and warm. After a hearty meal, swallow them whole at once to stave off hunger for fifty to a hundred days. Drink water when thirsty, but consume no other food. To purge the medicine, drink two *sheng* of hot porridge, and the beans will pass. Another variant: face the sun, bow twice, then take one *sheng*, chewing thoroughly in the mouth before swallowing. Repeat thrice daily. The next day, divide one *sheng* into three doses. For children, halve the amount. Alternatively, swallow two to three *sheng* of red bean meat to sustain oneself for a year. Another method: take three *sheng* of yellow soybean powder in a single dose to go without food for ten or five days. To purge, take one *fangcunbi* of mallow stem ash, followed by lard and fermented milk products.

**Another Method**
Chew a piece of wax the size of a *chuanmu* until soft, then place it inside a plump jujube and chew together until fully dissolved and swallowed. This halts heat, cures illness, and enables grain avoidance. Alternatively, consume one *fangcun* of wax at dawn to ward off hunger for a day.

**Another Method**
Dry and pound black mulberries, then take three *ge* with water thrice daily to banish hunger.

**Another Method**
Combine three *jin* each of cow’s milk fat, sheep’s milk fat, pine resin, wax, and honey. Boil together and consume to sustain oneself for three years without hunger.

**Another Method**
Mix one *sheng* of asparagus root powder, one *sheng* of pine resin, and one *sheng* each of wax and honey. Boil together and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take three pills the size of marbles at midday daily to banish hunger and enhance complexion. This is said to be a secret formula from Cui Wen’s own hand. Remove the heart and skin of the asparagus root.

**Methods for Resuming Grain Consumption After Sustaining the Center**
After taking medicines to avoid grain, refrain from consuming miscellaneous foods. If thirsty, drink only a little cold water. To resume grain consumption, first take mallow seed decoction to purge the medicine, then proceed as follows:
On the first day, consume porridge made from one *ge* of rice thrice daily. On the second day, increase to two *ge* of rice twice daily. After three more days, take five *ge* of rice. After another three days, take seven *ge*. After yet another three days, consume one *sheng* daily. After a month, return to normal eating.

**Mallow Seed Decoction**
Take one *sheng* of mallow seeds and one *jin* of pig fat. Boil in five *dou* of water until reduced to two *sheng*. Strain and consume gradually until the medicine is fully purged. Alternatively, mix with rice to make a thin porridge, or add Sichuan perilla for better effect.

**Another Method**
Grind equal parts mallow seeds and nitre into powder. Take one *fangcunbi* with rice water twice daily for ten days until the medicine is fully purged, then resume grain consumption. Alternatively, take one *sheng* each of mallow seeds and nitre with three *sheng* of rice, boil until reduced to one *sheng*, and consume thrice daily.

**Another Method**
Grind hemp seeds, boil until soft, and drink five *sheng* to purge the medicine. Alternatively, prepare as a thin gruel and consume with rich, smooth foods for best results.

*The Scripture of the Great Clarity’s Methods for Avoiding Grain* concludes here.
