**Postface to *The Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings: A Legacy of Secrets***

The divine chapters of the Golden Watchtower are the silent, esoteric writings of the Three Sovereigns.
In Heaven, they align with Heaven as the Dao, governing the Five Phases, manifesting the myriad spirits, and presiding over the ten thousand forms.
On Earth, they harmonize with Earth as virtue, administering the ten thousand things, seizing spectral aberrations, and severing wayward spirits.
Thus, they constitute the supreme art of dominion and restraint, the most sacred and deathless Way.

Within them lie the latent workings of yin and yang and the six transformations, enabling the practitioner to avoid external calamities.
Dwelling in mountains, halting in grottoes and forests, cultivating truth and nurturing simplicity, seeking out the cliffs and valleys of the wilds—without this text, spectral beings would often bring ruin to one’s life and nature.
Even in the bustling markets and the chambers of houses, where years may pass without a human trace, spectral and wayward forces may yet linger—how much more so in the secluded valleys, the remote paths, and the fragrant depths of the forests?
To dwell in the mountains and guard stillness without possessing this text is to cast oneself into the very jaws of death.

Now, this text is bestowed to discern the true from the false, that later students of immortality may avoid misfortune and untimely harm to their lives.

Written in the year *bingwu* during the Chrysanthemum Festival, by the Purple Tenuity Daoist.

**The Celestial Sovereign’s Esoteric Writings, Upper Scroll**

**The Celestial Sovereign’s Esoteric Writings, Upper Scroll**

Heaven births clouds and dragons; the Dao/Way fundamentally ascends. Radiant is the upright qi, resplendent in the Great Clarity. It aids and rectifies the true Dao/Way, proceeding in rectitude and balance. The six *jia* penetrate the primordial, the nine heavens transcend form. Blessings extend to descendants, and immortal practice becomes authentic.

Next, the Human Sovereign: humanity reveres longevity. The six *ding* and nine qi, secret and truly sincere—revere them, and ultimate felicity shall be yours. The August Emperor’s noble name has long known the Dao/Way’s wonders; the body enjoys enduring tranquility. Those who hear these true phrases shall perpetually embody their purity.

The above eighty characters: recite them silently once daily to seek the Dao/Way of longevity. Even for descendants, all shall attain enlightenment. Blessings extend to the seven ancestors, and fortune reaches a thousand lives. Exalted is the Great One, the true and correct jade script. It severs and extinguishes demonic perversity, harmonizing with the Jade Clarity. The immortal method is fundamentally correct; its name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity. The sagely work endures, and only upon its completion is it known. A flourishing destiny and great enterprise—the immortal host safeguards it. Thus is the golden script commanded, its mandate set by decree.

The above fifty-six characters: at each of the four seasons and eight solar terms, when offering sacrifices to ancestral kin, recite them silently seven times. Do not record them in the black register. The wise must not let others know, lest they be carelessly divulged. The transmission of this scripture conceals this prohibitive method.

The above six characters: after transmitting this *Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings*, if the master does not cultivate practice for ten days, celestial spirits will not attend. If transmission is improper, it shall not be received. Only follow the prescribed method of transmission; do not let others treat it lightly.

Upon receiving the Three Sovereigns, one shall perpetually wander the Jade Clarity. Malevolence and evil shall be subdued and extinguished, and one shall forever dwell in mountain halls. Azure clouds follow me; the six *gui* preserve authenticity. Those who safeguard it shall have the six *jia* as their protectors. Do not slight our covenant, and you shall assuredly ascend to the Great Clarity. Your life shall be prolonged, your years extended; jade spirits shall support your form. For ten thousand kalpas, you shall be an immortal, perpetually abiding in the Cinnabar Heaven. The Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the cinnabar caves of mountain streams, the altars of the soil and springs—myriad spirits are arrayed therein. Wind Lords and Rain Masters, stars and constellations, all uphold the esoteric formulas.

The above eighty characters: on the days of the six *jia* and six *gui*, recite them thrice each. The spirits of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and altars of the soil shall protect and assist you.

All arcane words are secretly transmitted by the august spirits. Inscribed upon silk and hidden in grotto-heavens, merit returns to the Great Perfected, and blessings ferry across a thousand springs. Though countless kalpas pass and seas and mountains crumble to dust, this scripture remains concealed. Five-colored clouds cast their radiance; the multitudes revere it. Alas, how flourishing! Uphold and receive the pure teachings, and your life shall be prolonged, your years eternal.

The above fifty-six characters: after wearing the *Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings*, transcribe the seal script and deposit it in the mountain wilds or grotto caves. Do not let others know, and you shall perpetually preserve a thousand springs. The numinous peaks and nine immortals, the blazing cinnabar grottoes—River Chariot and Heavenly Stem guard the Dao/Way’s arcane words. Those who recklessly divulge them shall be punished by the shortening of their lives, calamity reaching the nine springs. Their bodies shall be pulverized, their forms shattered—let not the golden script be spoken of. Be cautious! Be vigilant!

The above thirty-seven characters: after wearing the *Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings*, if one discusses them with others or carelessly divulges them, calamity shall reach the nine ancestors. Bones shall be ground to powder, forms injured, and the golden script forever barred.

The arcane words total three hundred and fifteen characters.

**The Terrestrial Sovereign’s Esoteric Writings, Middle Scroll**

The kingdom harmonizes with the laws of pitch-pipes; the four seas all submit. Ethereal is the Jade Void, repelling perversity and preserving the spirit. For ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no peril. Neighboring lands and territories—blessings shall universally grace them. Banished are misfortune and calamity; virtue and fortune stand resplendent. Trust, reverence, clarity, and restraint—cultivate with utmost sincerity to preserve the spirit throughout the year. Return to the Dao/Way, relinquish the mundane, and diligently pursue the immortal records. Mountains and rivers, peaks and waterways—west, south, east, and north.

The above sixty-four characters: when traversing mountain valleys or dwelling by rivers and waterways, recite them silently once to repel evil beasts, flood dragons, venomous snakes, spectral perversities, *wangliang* demons, and demonic aberrations of all kinds.

The Terrestrial Sovereign’s secret seal harmonizes with heaven and earth. The Three Sovereigns’ true words radiate blessings to the nine springs. All sentient and insentient beings belong to the Supreme Mystery. Yin and yang generate each other; all things possess numinosity. The myriad classes of beings with consciousness all accord with the Dao/Way’s arts. Cultivate with reverence and sincerity, and you may anticipate ascension. Strive to perceive the mysterious and hidden; do not seek me in vain. Study the method with precision and persistence; do not harbor doubts. On peaks and waterways, all shall protect you. Revering the Three Scriptures—this is the rare and precious path.

The above eighty characters: when encountering difficulties among livestock, embryos, eggs, or creatures born of moisture, recite them silently once. The dead shall be liberated, and the living shall find peace. Do not let others hear these true phrases.

Rivers and seas, vast and mighty; pools and springs, arrayed and spread. Human and spirit alike employ them, their patterns conforming to the five directions. Bright stars and great spirits, the High Emperor’s jade script—repel peril and danger, protect the kingdom and its people. The dragon spirits of renowned rivers capture misfortune and dispel adversity. Peaks and waterways, famous mounds, the lunar Yin and the rigid continent—yellow dragons are arrayed in accordance with vows and supplications. The radiant Yang aids and rectifies; Daoists and lay followers alike know to revere these words. Their households shall be free of worry; demonic perversities and wayward qi shall never linger.

The above eighty characters: transcribe a clean copy, inscribe your name, and bury it among ancestral tombs as a declaration to the nine ancestors. Write in black ink on white paper, then seal it with black paper, also inscribing your name.

To navigate the world and seek life, this Dao/Way must be practiced. Through kalpas, one shall remain secure and untroubled, assuredly attaining longevity. Those who can safeguard it shall surely see prosperity and uprightness. Recite it ten thousand times, and jade maidens shall descend to welcome you. Kings keep it secret, and the kingdom shall universally know peace.

The above forty characters: regarding the talismanic script of the Three Sovereigns, recite it a hundred times to attain the longevity of earthbound immortals. Do not let fellow altar practitioners become aware, lest the work remain unaccomplished.

The arcane words total two hundred and sixty-four characters.

**The Human Sovereign’s Esoteric Writings, Lower Scroll**

Raise your gaze to the Heavenly Eye, where the radiant star and moon within the heart shine with youthful brilliance. The celestial luminaries traverse Qian and Kun, while earthly spirits receive the Dipper’s charge. Lin Zhen guards the earthly gate; Xun, Kan, Li, and Wu mark the human portal. Kun, Si, Dui, and You open the heavenly gate; Qian, Si, and Kan guard the ghostly gate. Gen and Wu oversee the head; Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Yuan ascend with Bing above Xin.

The above fifty-seven characters: When preparing for a ritual offering, first transcribe a copy and burn it. The eight trigrams and twenty positions repel external malevolence from trespassing, while divine spirits safeguard the gates. Do not allow others to see or recite it.

Ride the celestial stem of Kuí and Lín; let humanity flourish in yang’s lament, granting longevity and prosperity. The nine heavens, nine lands, nine persons, nine destinies, nine perfected, nine Dao/Ways, nine arts, nine births, nine vastnesses, nine mysteries, nine essentials, and nine accomplishments—along with the one hundred and seventeen transcendent powers—ascend with Zhang Tian Gong, ensuring the world’s goodness without revelation.

The above fifty-one characters: When entering mountains or waters to subdue malevolent spirits, inscribe them in black on white silk and burn it over water to quell them. Do not let others know of this.

Summon the Dragon Spirit of the Nine Constructions: Remove, Full, Level, Establish, House, Ascend, Bright, Divine, Know, Bend, Destiny, Hook, Support, Bright, Fire, Three Persons, Radiance, Nine Heavens, and other spirits. The great Six Ghosts and Azure Omens retreat; destiny ascends in obeisance. Three flames must blaze; three stones and nine kings expel deceit. Hasten! Three Qian must not; nine nines transform nine heavens, nine oxen, two persons, fish, and transgressions. The world remains pure, and the nine unite in brightness, issuing destiny left and right.

The above seventy-four characters: Write with realgar on stone or tile and bury at the four corners of your dwelling. Do not let others know, for this summons the Wealth Spirit and Prosperity Spirit.

Four stones, mountain foxes, issuing destiny, prosperity’s gate—thus, women find peace within. Speak the words of Ye Liao; six left leaves, nine heavens, nine heavens, nine heavens—accomplished! This azure one!

The above thirty-four characters: Follow one seal script, write in red on white paper, and burn it daily on an empty stomach. Mix the ashes with water and consume. If the divine words foretell fortune, fortune comes; if misfortune, misfortune follows. Exhale to cure illness—none shall remain uncured.

The arcane words total two hundred and sixteen characters.

The above constitutes the **Esoteric Writings of the Three Sovereigns**. Those who study the Dao/Way must carry them, for only then may they commune with the divine. If one has not received the Daoist registers, they must not recklessly practice this. It is fitting to conceal them within renowned mountains and secluded valleys to avoid heavenly retribution. This method was not transmitted by the original master, lest the celestial mechanisms be revealed. Fellow students must speak sparingly of it, for slander against these sacred texts brings calamity upon oneself—suffering under royal law in life and hell in death. Be cautious, be most cautious; keep it secret, keep it most secret.

**The Secret Seal of the Yellow Spirit of Great Clarity**
Carve from the heartwood of a jujube tree struck by lightning, on the fifth day of the fifth month, or on a spring Jiazi day, or a summer Bingwu day.

For all who receive and hold this seal: On a Jiazi day at the hour of *rending* (9–11 PM), place it in a purified chamber. Offer three platters of fried cakes, cypress broth, and salted fermented beans. Bow twice and present incense. Declare: *"Today, this humble servant [your name] respectfully addresses the Dao Lord, August Heaven, and the Messenger of the Great Unity. I now carry this precious seal, wishing for freedom from illness within and the severance of all malevolence without. May it protect heaven and humanity, dispel spirits, and repel evil. May all I seek come naturally, uniting with the Dao/Way."* Present incense thrice, bow again, and conclude the petition.

**Diagram of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital Seal**
Perfectly square, 3.2 *cun* per side, 0.8 *cun* thick, with two lines of seal script.

The **Upper Clarity Seal of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital**: When carried while climbing mountains, wolves, tigers, and spectral beings submit of their own accord. Rivers and winds yield to safe passage. It commands the immortal officials and soldiers of grotto heavens. Wolves cannot harm, tigers cannot wound, waters cannot drown. In times of great peril, salvation is assured. For ordinary people, it extends lifespan, subdues malevolent ghosts, and repels all evil. To treat night terrors and convulsions in children, or various ailments in adults, burn it to ash, mix with frankincense decoction, and consume—efficacy is immediate. It hastens difficult births and expels stillborn fetuses, stabilizes pregnancies, and grants conception to barren women. It resolves curses, grievances, and injustices, sharpens the mind, and fulfills all uses. Treat it with reverence; do not slight it.

**The Talisman of the Great Mystery’s Messenger**
**Summoning Incantation**: *"Xuan Ying Lie Hong."*
**Summoning Talisman**: Visualize the officers and soldiers descending from the Dipper before you. Hold the talisman in the left hand and grasp it in the right, drawing the spirit’s qi and blowing it onto the talisman. Use the secret incantation where essence departs.

The **Secret Seal of the Yellow Spirit Yue Chapter** subdues all malevolence, along with various spectral disasters and urgent calamities. When meeting kings and great ministers, all shall rejoice, and all desires shall be fulfilled. Carry it constantly at the waist or in the sleeve, and hidden soldiers shall guard and assist. Do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy, lest you incur heavenly retribution, bringing misfortune upon nine generations—regret shall be too late.

**Incantation of the Yue Chapter**:
*"The Yellow Spirit Yue Chapter of the Most High Lord Lao slays and vanquishes the ghostly soldiers of heaven and earth—how dare they resist! The Eastern Star of the Year, the Western Venus, the Northern Pole Star, the Southern Mars—great sages transform, annihilating ghostly essences, executing thieves and bandits, subduing all armies. Immortal youths and jade maidens, celestial and terrestrial spirits, Zhang Star drives away and captures all malevolent qi. The Well and Willow Stars transmit, the Horn Star pacifies. Demons and goblins are governed by destiny and summoned to the imperial court. The Three and Five govern malevolent qi, seize the register of death, inscribe the name of life. The stem of Wu destroys, the spirit of Yi is refined. Heavenly immortals descend to the disciple Yue Chapter. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law and command of the Most High Lord Lao!"*

**Incantation of the Seal**:
*"Yellow Spirit of Heavenly Chapter, the imperial seal of the Yellow Spirit of the Celestial Court, capturing ghostly essences. The Eastern Dipper establishes the node by the Star of the Year; the Southern Dipper governs destiny and repels all armies. The Western Dipper’s Ladle and Scoop subdue ghostly essences; the Northern Dipper binds essence and reports to the imperial court. The Yellow Spirit slays ghosts and their qi alike; the Central Dipper’s Great Ladle is the Star of Mars."*

The Horn and Neck govern the assembly of qi and names, the Star of Zhang and Fire expel the myriad armies. The Great Sage transforms spirits and slays rampant qi, the Ox, Sequence, Winnowing Basket, and Dipper shield the body’s form. The Stem of Wu and the Emperor of the Five Stars bestow longevity, the Celestial Sovereign’s Envoys slay malevolent essences. The Most High bestows upon your servant this Yellow Spirit Seal—swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law and command!

**Incantation to Slay Ghosts**:
*"Most High Lord Lao, teach me to slay ghosts, grant me divine methods. Above, I summon the Jade Maidens to gather and seize inauspiciousness. Ascend the mountain, and the rocks split; wear the seal, don the floral canopy, tread upon the Ladle and Stem. To the left, the Six Jia spirits lend support; to the right, the Six Ding spirits guard. Before me stands the Yellow Spirit; behind me, the Yue Chapter. Divine marshals strike and slay, unyielding to the mighty. First, they slay evil ghosts; next, they sever the night’s radiance. What spirit would not submit? What ghost would dare resist?"*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law and command!

**Command Against Pestilence**:
*"I command the Eastern Green Pestilence ghosts, the essence of rotting wood; the Southern Red Pestilence ghosts, the essence of scorching fire; the Western White Pestilence ghosts, the essence of hollow metal; the Northern Black Pestilence ghosts, the essence of abyssal pools; the Central Yellow Pestilence ghosts, the essence of filth and earth. Born of the four seasons and eight nodes, thriving in their vigor, spirits unnurtured within turn outward to craft malevolent essences. The qi of the Five Poisons enters the human form, now cold, now hot, unsettling the five limbs. O Nine Ugly ghosts, I know your names—depart swiftly, tarry not!"*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law and command!

Respectfully recorded: In the fourth year of Han’an, the Ancestral Celestial Master battled the Six Heavens’ Demon Kings in Shu, seizing the Twenty-Four Governances. At the Yellow Emperor’s altar on Mount Qingcheng, a covenant was sworn. Humans dwell in yang brightness; ghosts lurk in yin darkness. The Six Heavens’ Demon Kings were banished to the Northern Capital, the Eight Divisions’ ghostly marshals and their hosts driven into the Western Regions. The Five Phases’ toxic qi were thus released. Stone was split into contracts, carved with the forms of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon, placed upon sheer cliffs. The divine seal encircled the ghostly encampments, severing their communication.

Now, these sacred talismans are disseminated. The devout should enshrine them in a purified chamber with incense and offerings. Naturally, they will dispel pestilence, repel evil, gather blessings, and summon auspiciousness. Only with utmost sincerity will there be no lack of response.
*Reverently proclaimed by the Orthodox Unity Original Altar of Mount Longhu.*

The *Baopuzi* states: "The ancients all wore this seal, which could repel tigers, leopards, and all mountain beasts. When sealing mud with this seal and placing it a hundred paces in each of the four directions, tigers and wolves will not approach. If one encounters fresh tiger tracks while traveling, imprinting the seal in alignment will drive the tiger away; imprinting it in reverse will summon the tiger. Not only tigers and wolves—if mountain forest shrines or blood-offering spirits capable of bringing fortune or misfortune are sealed with mud blocks in the four directions, their traces will no longer manifest their numinous power.

Once, there was a stone in a deep pool, atop which perched a great turtle that wrought calamity as a spirit. A Daoist named Dai Bing used several hundred blocks of sealed mud, casting them from a boat into the pool. After a long while, a turtle over a *zhang* in length floated motionless to the surface, while smaller turtles gathered upon the water. Those afflicted by its harm were immediately healed, and the place is now called Turtle Pool.

If one recites this text while visualizing a red youth guarding the heart, performing twenty-four breaths, and inscribes talismans five *cun* tall and four *cun* wide—twenty-four in total—then all birds and beasts, no matter how fierce, will flee. Command them to halt, and they halt; command them to act, and they obey. Not only tigers and leopards—sealing ghostly shrines with this talisman yields great efficacy.

The Most High said: "To command ghosts and spirits, first take equal parts of ghost arrows and ghost days, two *liang* each, dry them in the shade, and grind them into fine powder. Mix with mulberry sap to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take seven pills on an empty stomach at dawn, swallowing them with pure water, and take seven more before going out. After forty-nine days, all ghosts and spirits, the Eight Officers, the Six Ding, and the Jade Maiden will come to pay homage, and even lions and tigers will submit to your command. After forty-nine days, do not take any more.

When taking the pills, inhale a mouthful of qi from the direction of the season’s vigor and recite the incantation:
*'Essence of a hundred medicines, eyes behold ghostly forms. Command the Eight Officers and the Six Ding, drive and employ ghosts and spirits, instantly attain communion. Prolong years and extend life, forever achieve longevity, ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, soar to the Supreme Clarity.'*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law and command!

The direction of vigor refers to east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, and north in winter. Use this with utmost sincerity to treat illnesses caused by malevolent forces—there will be no lack of response.
