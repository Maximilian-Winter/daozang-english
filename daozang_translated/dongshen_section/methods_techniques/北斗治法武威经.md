*The Northern Dipper’s Governance and Martial Might Scripture*

At the end of the Daye era of the Sui, heroes arose on all sides. Foxes and leopards transformed, and commoners soared like dragons. It was the time when dragons and serpents emerged from the land, the beginning of tigers’ gazes and whales’ devouring. Among those who had not yet assumed office was Yuan Qing, who dwelt in seclusion. Qing, though a commoner, wandered the arts between the Yi and Luo Rivers, concealing his virtue and storing his strategies. Like a towering pine emerging from the ravine, or a lofty cypress piercing the clouds, he remained steadfast in his integrity.

In the first year of the *Tede* era, Qing was initially appointed as a minister to govern disorder. One midnight in Luoyang, the Eastern Capital, a man suddenly arrived at his gate. Qing, holding a candle, observed him: the visitor wore a five-colored lotus crown, a robe woven with the nine *qi* of cloud and mist, and held in his hands a sacred text. He addressed Qing: “I am the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens. Knowing your devotion to the Dao and your peerless resolve, I have come to deliver you. I bestow upon you this *Martial Might Scripture*, a divine method of celestial rigor. If you practice it, you will assist a sagely and enlightened ruler. During the decade of dragon wars, you will establish great merit, bring peace to the myriad beings, and your name will resound across the world. You will transcend the mortal and enter the sacred, leaving a fragrant legacy for ten thousand generations.”

As he finished speaking, he ascended into the cloud-paths, accompanied by the sounds of bells, drums, and the *Xiaoshao* melody. Qing bowed deeply, gazing at the clouds as they parted. The numinous wind faded, and rain dispersed the clouds. Upon examining the Mysterious Maiden’s secret text in his humble chamber, he devoted himself day and night. Within a year, he suddenly mastered its supreme techniques. His strategies placed him above a million men, yet he served under a single lord.

When the August Tang founded its enterprise, he eradicated the demonic *qi*, and the Four Seas became as clear as a mirror, the Nine Rivers as limpid as jade. Qing was enfeoffed as Left Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat and granted the rank of Supreme Duke—all by virtue of this method’s efficacy.

The method is called *The Northern Dipper’s Twelve Stars*, though only nine are commonly known. They correspond to the hours of the day, the eight solar terms, and follow the Celestial Stem in its leftward circuit, ever residing in the *chou* position. The Seven Stars alternate in concealment and manifestation—these are the Auxiliary and Aligning Stars. When the Seven Stars shine brightly, the world is at peace. If one star dims, disaster befalls the corresponding region. One must observe them diligently to discern omens and anomalies. This must not be transmitted to the unworthy; receive it with reverence and preserve its oral secrets. The Dipper’s Stem follows below.

1. **Heavenly Pivot** (name effaced), styled *Greedy Wolf*, governs the Celestial Origin and the self. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Room, Wall, Straddler,* and *Stomach*, corresponding to the Qin region and the *Xuzhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Grand Commandant. Those born in the *zi* hour belong to it.

2. **Heavenly Task** (name effaced), styled *Great Gate*, governs the Terrestrial Origin and yin punishments. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Stomach, Hairy Head, Net,* and *Turtle Beak*, corresponding to the Chu region and the *Yizhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Arbiter. Those born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it.

3. **Heavenly Pillar** (name effaced), styled *Salary Store*, governs the Solar Origin and blessings. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Well, Ghost, Willow,* and *Spread*, corresponding to the Liang region and the *Jizhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Void Controller. Those born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it.

4. **Heavenly Heart** (name effaced), styled *Literary Curve*, governs the Lunar Origin and emoluments. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Spread, Star, Wings,* and *Chariot*, corresponding to the Wu region and the *Jingzhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Vanguard. Those born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it.

5. **Heavenly Creature** (name effaced), styled *Incorruptible Chastity*, governs the River Origin and official positions. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Horn, Neck, Root,* and *House*, corresponding to the Zhao region and the *Yanzhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Dipper Lord. Those born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it.

6. **Heavenly Auxiliary** (name effaced), styled *Martial Curve*, governs the River Origin and longevity. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Heart, Tail, Dipper,* and *Winnowing Basket*, corresponding to the Yan region and the *Yangzhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Grand Master of Ceremonies. Those born in the *si* or *wei* hours belong to it.

7. **Heavenly Impulse** (name effaced), styled *Breaking Army*, governs the Sea Origin and wives and concubines. It oversees the four lunar lodges of *Ox, Girl, Void,* and *Roof*, corresponding to the Qi region and the *Yuzhou* division. It serves as the Celestial Supreme Emperor. Those born in the *wu* hour belong to it.

8. **Auxiliary Star**, surnamed *Essence Eternal*, taboo name *Upper Opening*, styled *Upright Extension*, oversees the scrutiny of the myriad states, the Nine Provinces, and the merits, transgressions, blessings, and misfortunes of their governing ministers. It corresponds to the Yan region and the *Bingzhou* division.

9. **Aligning Star**, surnamed *Dark Void*, taboo name *Yin-Yang*, styled *Dark and Remote*, oversees the scrutiny of the myriad states, the Nine Provinces, and the merits, transgressions, blessings, and misfortunes of their governing ministers. It corresponds to the Zhou region and the *Yongzhou* division.

For those of the twelve destinies who face urgent calamities, merely reciting the names of the Seven Stars will transform all disasters into blessings.

The Seven Stars in the heavens form the Emperor’s Chariot; the four stars are the *Xuanji*, and the three stars are the *Jade Balance*. When the Son of Heaven follows the Dao, the stars shine with great brilliance. When the ruler loses the Way, the divine radiance dims and vanishes.

When malevolent qi converges and ominous stars emerge intermittently, observe their positions closely to discern the portents of change. If:

Metal holds dominion, gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin grow precious.
Wood holds dominion, the five grains and nine crops ripen in abundance.
Water holds dominion, salt rises in price, rivers overflow, and epidemics spread.
Fire holds dominion, flames scorch cities and towns.
Earth holds dominion, the realm fractures, and ministers suffer calamity.
Comets hold dominion, warfare erupts across the land; if they linger, the sovereign’s authority wanes while ministers grow insolent.
A blazing star holds dominion, the ruler’s governance weakens, and loyal ministers depart.
Five-colored clouds hold dominion, great misfortune befalls the realm, and war arises.
Azure clouds hold dominion, the state receives blessings.
Crimson clouds hold dominion, fire consumes cities and towns.
Yellow clouds hold dominion, conflict arises.
White clouds hold dominion, bloodshed stains the fields.
Black clouds hold dominion, the land is deluged by floods.
Five-colored qi holds dominion, the realm suffers catastrophic disaster.
Azure qi holds dominion, war erupts in the Central Plains.
Crimson qi holds dominion, strife arises.
White qi holds dominion, the people starve.
Black qi holds dominion, cannibalism spreads.
Yellow qi holds dominion, the state loses territory.

The twenty-eight lunar lodges each govern distinct domains, all linked to the divisions of the *Xuanji*. Whether wind, rain, thunder, or hail, or the myriad phenomena of the human world, all are subject to the auguries of martial might—nothing is left unrecorded; the discerning shall take heed.

**Jiao** governs rainfall among mortals, overseeing the vitality of all that grows below.

**Zhen** governs clarity, overseeing weeping, partings, and deaths below.

The Dark Lady of the Dao states: The Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper govern life, death, fortune, and misfortune among mortals. Its handle, called *Celestial Brilliance*, is the *Breaking Army Star* of heavenly might, the seat of martial authority in the world. All stars, spirits, and ghosts dare not trespass; upon sighting it, they flee afar.

From this source alone emerge the divine arts: the Five Phases, divination, the *Zhouyi*, the Six Ren, the Three Marvels of *Dunjia*, the Eight Gates, and the Void—along with all military strategies. None can rival its supremacy. Passed down in secret by immortals through the ages, its teachings extend beyond warfare: when establishing a state, it ensures prosperity; in governing, it secures the bonds between sovereign and subject, father and child.

When practicing this method, first perform the *Yu Step*, aligning with the *Celestial Pivot*. Visualize yourself as the White Crane Immortal, then recite the incantation of the *Celestial Pivot* spirits:

*"The Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper, great deities of heaven,
Ascend to the Golden Palace, descend to cover Kunlun.
Regulating the cosmic order, governing the cosmos,
The *Xuanji* turns ceaselessly, day and night.
The primordial qi of the Primal Sovereign comes to guard my body.
Encompassing the great celestial realm, penetrating the tiniest dust,
What disaster cannot be dispelled? What blessing cannot be attained?
Though I dwell among the vulgar, I seek the Dao and its numinous power.
May I always behold your august presence and be granted longevity.
The Most High Jade Emperor, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,
Protect your servant in this world, granting boundless years of spring.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

The method of the *Celestial Pivot* states: Always begin counting from the month’s established branch, observing at the hour of *Xu* to determine the dominant hour—this marks where the *Celestial Pivot* arrives. All actions must follow its course; to advance against it is to commit rebellion. Those who rebel shall perish.

When opening cities, fortifying passes, constructing, relocating graves, or choosing inauspicious months and years, repeated calamities will strike. When leading armies to crush enemies, if they occupy an auspicious direction while we stand in an ill-omened one; when paying homage to the emperor, visiting officials, or assuming office; when climbing mountains or crossing seas, facing storms, waves, or threats from dragons and fish; when lodging in malevolent temples or altars, fleeing war, evading harm from villains, or facing tigers, wolves, or venomous creatures; when traveling for profit, seeking skills, or pursuing any endeavor—employ the *Celestial Pivot* method.

First invoke the Northern Dipper, recite the incantation, then chant the names of the Seven Stars. With a staff, draw upon the earth: four vertical lines, five horizontal lines. Perform the *Yu Step* and proceed in accordance with the *Celestial Pivot*. Whatever you undertake, disasters will dissolve.

When entering a household afflicted by pestilence or poison, perform the *Celestial Pivot* method, recite the names, and summon the *Gu* spirits by name. Swear to them, saying: *"Submit beneath my *Pei* and *Gang*, sink three feet into the earth—all shall be auspicious, none inauspicious."*

When passing beneath crumbling walls or dilapidated structures, proceed with face upturned—this brings good fortune.

The *Yu Step* incantation reads:
*"Four vertical, five horizontal,
Six Jia, Six Ding.
Yu the King governs the Dao,
Chiyou averts weapons.
Traverse all under Heaven,
Twist the halberd to reverse fate.
All tigers and wolves, bandits and thieves,
All vicious and malevolent forces—
Submit beneath my *Pei* and *Gang*,
Move not, act not."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

**The *Yu Step* Method**
**Hand Seal of the *Yu Step***
Before commencing, arrange all matters, recite the incantation to its end, then proceed—do not look back.
