**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Formula for Nurturing Life**
*Transmitted by Hua Tuo to Wu Pu of Guangling*

**1. The Five Animal Frolics**

The Supreme Lord Lao said: The immortals of old practiced *daoyin*, stretching and pulling the body, moving all the joints to seek agelessness. This was called the "Five Animal Frolics." Stretching the limbs and hooves served as *daoyin*. When discomfort arose in the body, one would perform the frolics of a single animal until sweat appeared, then cease. The body would feel light and at ease. Practicing this widely, one could live over nine hundred years, with keen hearing and sight, and teeth intact and firm.

Yet while the method is simple, few practice it—how lamentable!

- **Tiger Frolic:** Crouch on all fours, advance three steps, retreat three steps, stretch the body, now forward, now backward. Lift the head to the sky, then return to crouching. Advance and retreat on all fours, seven times each.
- **Bear Frolic:** Lie flat on the back, clasp the knees with both hands, raise the head, and tilt left to touch the ground seven times, then right seven times. Rock on the ground, pushing left and right with the hands, seven times each.
- **Deer Frolic:** Crouch on all fours, stretch the neck and look back, left three times, right three times. Extend the left leg while bending the right, then the right leg while bending the left. Stretch and contract alternately, three times each.
- **Ape Frolic:** Grasp an object and hang suspended, stretching and contracting the body up and down seven times. Clasp the object with the feet and hang upside down, left seven times, right seven times. Sit, grasp the left foot with the right hand, press five times, seven times each.
- **Bird Frolic:** Stand, lift one foot, stretch both arms, flap vigorously, fourteen times each. Sit, extend the legs, pull the toes seven times each, stretch and contract the arms seven times each.

The Five Animal Frolics may be practiced according to one’s strength, stopping when sweat appears. They lighten the body, aid digestion, replenish *qi* and strength, and dispel all illnesses. Hua Tuo practiced them and lived beyond ten thousand years. His disciple, Wu Pu of Guangling, also attained longevity through their transmission.

**2. Six Qi for Inhalation and Exhalation**

- **Yan (咽):** *Yan* governs the lungs. The lungs connect to the five viscera. When afflicted by wind, the nose becomes blocked. Treat with *yan* exhalation and inhalation.
- **He (呵):** *He* governs the heart. The heart connects to the tongue. When the five viscera overheat, the tongue dries. Treat with *he* exhalation and inhalation.
- **Hu (呼):** *Hu* governs the spleen. The spleen connects to the lips. As the saying goes: "When the spleen is warm, the lips scorch." Treat with *hu* exhalation and inhalation.
- **Xu (嘘):** *Xu* governs the liver. The liver connects to the eyes. As the saying goes: "When the liver is excessive, the eyes redden." Treat with *xu* exhalation and inhalation.
- **Chui (吹):** *Chui* governs the kidneys. The kidneys connect to the ears. As the saying goes: "When the kidneys are deficient, the ears deafen." Treat with *chui* exhalation and inhalation.
- **Xi (嘻):** *Xi* governs the Triple Burner. Treat with *xi* exhalation and inhalation when afflicted.

**3. The True Formula for Nurturing Life**

The superior practitioner cultivates it to preserve the True and extend life...

The middling practitioner cultivates it to avoid all disasters and misfortunes;
The lesser practitioner cultivates it to escape bodily harm and untimely death;
The foolish scorn it and perish prematurely.

Lord Lao said: A person’s body is like the image of a kingdom.
The chest and abdomen are as palaces;
The limbs’ positions are as the suburbs and borders;
The divisions of the joints are as the hundred officials;
The spaces between the skin and flesh are as the four thoroughfares.
The spirit is as the ruler, blood as the ministers, qi as the people.
He who can govern his body is like a wise lord who governs his state.
Loving one’s people ensures the state’s peace;
Loving one’s qi ensures the body’s wholeness.
When the people are exhausted, the state perishes;
When qi is depleted, the body decays.

Thus the perfected and superior practitioners administer medicine before illness arises, not chase after it once ruin has set in.
Know that life is hard to preserve yet easy to lose,
Qi is hard to purify yet easy to pollute.
If one can discern the subtle workings of opportunity, one may secure the altars of the state;
If one can restrain desires, one may safeguard life and destiny.

Now, those who excel in nurturing life must first eliminate the six harms before they can preserve life and prolong their years to a hundred.
What are these six?
First, diminish fame and profit;
Second, forbid indulgence in sound and beauty;
Third, moderate wealth and possessions;
Fourth, relinquish rich flavors;
Fifth, eradicate deceit and falsehood;
Sixth, abandon envy and jealousy.
Remove these six, and the Dao of cultivating life will succeed without fail.
If these six are not eliminated, no benefit will be seen—
Even if one’s heart yearns for subtle principles, mouth recites true scriptures, savors their essence, and practices breathwork with celestial images, it cannot compensate for life’s brevity.
To abandon the root and vainly seek the branches is deeply lamentable!

To preserve one’s true nature, one must:
Think little, contemplate little,
Laugh little, speak little,
Rejoice little, anger little,
Delight little, sorrow little,
Desire little, detest little,
Engage in few affairs, entertain few schemes.

For excessive thought injures the spirit,
Excessive contemplation wearies the heart,
Excessive laughter overturns the organs,
Excessive speech depletes the Sea of Qi,
Excessive joy invites guest wind into the bladder,
Excessive anger causes the interstices to surge,
Excessive delight leads the heart-spirit astray,
Excessive sorrow withers hair and beard,
Excessive desire topples will and qi,
Excessive detestation scatters essence and clarity,
Excessive affairs dry and strain the sinews,
Excessive scheming plunges wisdom into confusion.
These erode life more severely than axes,
Devour one’s nature more fiercely than wolves.

Avoid prolonged sitting or walking, prolonged seeing or hearing.
Do not force eating—eating when not hungry wearies the spleen;
Do not force drinking—drinking when not thirsty distends the stomach.
The body should be regularly active, food taken to half-satiety;
Do not over-exert, do not exceed half-fullness.
In winter, do not leave the stomach empty at dawn or dusk;
In summer, do not eat to fullness at night.
Rise early, but not before the cock’s crow;
Rise late, but not after sunrise.

When the mind is serene, the true spirit guards its place;
When qi is settled, pathogenic influences depart the body.
Deceitful conduct saddens the spirit;
Contentious behavior dispirits it.
To slight others invites misfortune;
To harm creatures ensures premature death.
Performing one good deed gladdens the hun-soul;
Committing one evil delights the po-soul.
Abide in magnanimity and tranquility,
And body and spirit will be at peace.
The Register of Life will inscribe one’s name,
The Ledger of Death will erase one’s faults.
The principles of nurturing life are all contained herein!

**Formula for Qi Absorption**
Lord Lao said: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle and unceasing, it exists as if present, yet its use is inexhaustible.
This refers to the mouth and nose as the gates of Heaven and Earth,
Through which one exhales and inhales the qi of yin and yang, life and death.

Each morning, face south, extend both hands upon the knees,
Gently press and knead the joints,
Exhale turbid qi from the mouth, inhale pure qi through the nose—
This is what is meant by "expelling the old and absorbing the new."
After holding the breath for a long while, exhale slowly.
Then, with the hands, stretch upward, downward, left, and right.
When drawing in qi, visualize the Great Harmony’s primordial qi descending into the hairline,
Flowing into the five viscera, and moistening the four limbs,
Like mountains receiving clouds, like the earth receiving moisture.
When qi flows freely, one feels a gurgling movement in the abdomen.
After ten cycles, the body feels supple and radiant,
The complexion lustrous,
The ears and eyes keen,
Food tastes better,
Strength doubles,
And all illnesses depart.

Another method: Perform this between midnight and noon, when qi is alive;
At other times, when qi is dead, do not regulate or absorb it.
After regulating qi, prepare a thick, soft mat,
Pillow height matching the body,
Lie flat on the back, legs extended,
Fists clenched four to five inches from the body,
Feet also four to five inches apart.
Gently inhale the solar qi through the nose,
Direct it with the mind to permeate the entire body,
Then hold the breath to its limit,
And exhale slowly through the mouth,
Taking care that no sound is heard.
For afflictions such as cold-heat, miasmic diseases, or swollen feet,
Practice this regardless of the hour.
If not cured the same day, repeat the next;
Within two or three days, recovery is certain.

For cold pain in the heart, exhale with *hu*;
For heat, exhale with *chui*;
For foot pain, exhale with *xu*;
For lung pain, exhale with *si*.

After midnight, perform twenty-four cycles;
At cock’s crow, eighteen;
At dawn, twelve;
At sunrise, twelve—
The more cycles, the better.
Before practicing this method, first perform the Eighteen Postures of Dao Yin
And the Twenty-Four Massages.
People rely on Dao Yin to dispel the five viscera’s diseases.

For heart disease, the body feels cold and hot.
In physiognomy, the heart’s color is red;
In dreams, one sees people in red garments wielding knives, staves, or fire to frighten.
The remedy: Use *hu* and *chui* exhalations to dispel it—
*Hu* dispels cold, *chui* dispels heat.

For lung disease, the chest and back feel distended and full,
The four limbs restless and oppressed.

In physiognomy, the lung’s color is white;
In dreams, one sees people in white garments—men and women embracing intimately,
Or women holding one another,
Or appearing as one’s parents, siblings, or spouse.
The remedy: Use *he* exhalation to dispel it.

For liver disease, one feels sorrowful and joyless,
With pain in the head and eyes.
In physiognomy, the liver’s color is green;
In dreams, one sees people in green garments wielding green knives or staves,
Or lions, tigers, or wolves to frighten.
The remedy: Use *xu* exhalation to dispel it.

For spleen disease, wandering wind afflicts the body,
Causing restless oppression and pain.
In physiognomy, the spleen’s color is yellow;
In dreams, one sees yellow objects,
Or children striking one’s flanks,
Or whirlwinds swirling around.
The remedy: Use *xi* exhalation to dispel it.

For kidney disease, the body feels cold and the *yin* declines.
In physiognomy, the kidney’s color is black;
In dreams, one sees people in black garments wielding knives or staves to frighten.
The remedy: Use *si* exhalation to dispel it.

Perform each method thirty-six times.
If practice does not yield a cure, supplement with left and right Dao Yin and massage.

It is said: The body is the master of the spirit;
Qi is the life of the spirit.
Thus, body and spirit depend on qi to endure.
Therefore, regulate and harmonize the four limbs,
Circulating through the six bowels.
If there is blockage or stagnation, illness arises.
Thus, the human body is formed of emptiness, completed by qi.
If breathing is properly regulated, all illnesses naturally dissipate.
If exhalation and inhalation deviate from the method, all illnesses arise.
Those who skillfully nurture life must first know the method of regulating qi.
This is what is meant by: "Breath and life arise together,
Aiming for longevity and joyful delight."
Such is the teaching!
