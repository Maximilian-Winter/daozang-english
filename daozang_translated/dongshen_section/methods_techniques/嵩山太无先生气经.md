**The Qi Classic of Master Taiwu of Mount Song**

**Title:** *The Qi Classic of Master Taiwu of Mount Song* (also known as *The Qi Classic of Master Taiwu*). Author unknown. Two scrolls. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Methods* section of the *Dongshen* Department. Collated with *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, included in scroll fifty-nine of that work.

**The Qi Classic of Master Taiwu of Mount Song, Scroll One (with Preface, same below)**

What the body relies upon is qi; what qi depends upon is the body. When qi is whole, the body is whole; when qi is exhausted, the body perishes. Thus, those who cultivate life invariably refine the body and nurture qi to preserve their existence. There has never been a body without qi—qi and form necessitate each other to take shape. Is this not abundantly clear?

I have long admired the supreme Dao and diligently sought its secret methods. For over thirty years, I have practiced qi cultivation and guarded the true, yet what I have heard and seen has never fully satisfied me. During the *Dali* era, I encountered Master Wang of Mount Luofu, who had returned from the Northern Marchmount. Leaning on his staff, he carried himself with lofty dignity, and we regarded each other with mutual respect. Struck by his extraordinary bearing, I invited him to converse, and indeed, he proved to be a gentleman of the Dao beyond the mundane world. Moved by my earnestness, he taught me the art of exhalation and inhalation, imparting one or two essential principles for governing the body. His boundless kindness cannot be expressed in words. He often said that the essential methods of the Dao are not found in scriptures but are transmitted orally as oral instructions. The methods of the *Two Radiances*, *Five Sprouts*, and *Six Wu* for absorbing qi all pertain to external qi. External qi is fierce and strong—it cannot be properly mastered by those who attend only to external matters. Only when the internal qi is rectified does one achieve what is called *embryonic breathing*. This resides naturally within the body and is not sought from without. Without receiving the oral instructions of a master, one’s efforts will be in vain, and no accomplishment will be attained.

What I have compiled here adheres to the essential teachings of my master, elucidating them clearly. Surely, this is not something I, in my ignorance, have devised myself. Master Wang once told me: "Laozi said, ‘My fate lies with me, not with Heaven and Earth.’ He also said, ‘I share a single qi with Heaven and Earth and govern it myself—how could Heaven and Earth cause my death?’ These are truly the essential words of the Dao." Those who cultivate and uphold the Dao should reflect on these teachings again and again, reverently heeding his guidance. I dare not but hold them in awe and follow them!

If one happens to obtain these instructions, one must be cautious not to transmit them lightly or reveal them carelessly, lest misfortune befall. This is a warning.

**Methods of Qi Absorption**

**Method for Cultivating the True and Absorbing Qi:**
At all times, collect the mind and eliminate thoughts. Hold the breath, clench the fists, inhale through the nose, and exhale through the mouth, ensuring no sound reaches the ears. The breath should be fine and subtle. When full, close the breath, and continue until sweat emerges from the soles of the feet. Begin with one or two breaths, gradually increasing to a hundred or more. When the breath is held to its limit, exhale slightly, then draw in a small amount of qi and hold it again. If hot, expel the breath with *he*; if cold, expel it with *chui*. When one reaches a thousand breaths, there will be no need for grain or medicine—only a cup of wine may be sipped occasionally to promote circulation. When the count reaches five thousand, one may move freely in and out of any place, and the efficacy will be self-evident. One will then possess the external skills of entering water.

In the practice of nourishing life through qi absorption, constancy is paramount. Only when true qi descends will there be resonance and communication. How can one indulge in desires and cravings while hoping for transcendence as a feathered immortal? Such a thing is impossible. Even the perfected and the most accomplished, if their practice is incomplete, cannot attain it—how much less can the common folk? But if one trusts the words of the old master and diligently practices, one will come to understand it naturally.

**Method of Advancement**

The *Method of Advancement* states: When preparing to absorb qi, one must first secure a high, dry, quiet, and secluded chamber. It need not be large, but it must be free of drafts. Incense should be burned constantly on either side of the room, though not the kind with a milky tip. The bedding should be thick and soft, and the feet slightly elevated. As the *True Instructions* say: "A high grove avoids the demon’s breath." This refers to demonic entities that thrive on earthly qi to assail people and cause misfortune. A height of three feet will suffice. Clothing should be adjusted for warmth or coolness. The pillow should be three *cun* and two *fen* high, with an additional one *cun* and nine *fen* of padding inside, so that it aligns evenly with the back.

**Method of Qi Absorption (Continued)**

At the time when *qi* is born after midnight, or upon first awakening before dawn, first exhale the turbid and foul *qi* from the abdomen, stopping after nine exhalations. To speak more broadly, this need not be confined to midnight or pre-dawn—whenever the weather is mild and the abdomen empty, the practice may begin. Close the eyes and click the teeth thirty-six times to rouse the spirits within the body. Then, with both hands, warm the eyes by gently pressing the large and small corners, massage the ears, and stroke the face—this is the *True Person’s* method of daily care.

Proceed with *daoyin* exercises as needed, first to free and smooth the joints. Press the tongue against the upper palate, stirring the saliva inside and outside the mouth until it fills, then swallow it, guiding it down into the stomach where the spirits receive it. Repeat this three times—this is called "rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid," which irrigates the five viscera and makes the complexion radiant.

Once this method is mastered in its general form, settle the spirit utterly, making the mind as vast as the great void, the body like an abandoned husk, all emotional burdens cast away—only then begin the absorption. For every step, keep the eyes closed and the hands clenched in fists, except when dispersing *qi*, at which point the fingers may be spread. Clenching the fists seals the gates and wards off perverse *qi* and essence.

Those newly practicing *qi* absorption may find *qi* and fluids flowing unchecked, making it impossible to clench the fists. After a hundred days or half a year, when the *qi* flows smoothly and the palms begin to sweat, clenching may then be employed. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *"Seal the three passes, clench the fists, and pause; rinse and swallow the numinous fluid, ingesting jade blossoms. Thus hunger ceases, the Three Worms perish, the heart and mind remain harmonious, and joy abounds."*

**Method of Cultivating Qi**

The *Method of Cultivating Qi* states: Each of the five viscera possesses its own *qi*. When lying down at night, hold the breath; upon awakening and before absorbing *qi*, first cultivate the *qi* to dissolve any lingering food, allowing the *qi* to emerge, after which it may be properly regulated and absorbed.

The method: Close the eyes, clench the fists, lie supine, place both fists between the breasts, raise the knees, lift the back and hips, and firmly contain the *qi* in the *qi* sea, directing it from within outward. Plow and turn it, then exhale with a *he* sound, stopping after nine or eighteen repetitions. This is called *cultivating qi*. Once done, proceed to regulate it.

**Method of Regulating Qi**

The *Method of Regulating Qi* states: The nose is the Gate of Heaven, the mouth the Door of Earth. Thus, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, without forcing the breath—doing so causes *qi* to rebel, and rebellion breeds illness. Be especially cautious during exhalation and inhalation. Do not let the sound be audible to your own ears; whether seven or nine repetitions, ensure the breath is even and harmonious—this is called *regulating qi*. Once regulated, swallow the *qi*. When lying down at night, do not exhale through the mouth. Constant mindfulness is required; with time, regulation becomes natural.

**Method of Swallowing Qi**

The *Method of Swallowing Qi* states: The subtlety of absorbing internal *qi* lies in swallowing. The world mistakes external *qi* for internal *qi*, failing to distinguish between them—how grave an error! Practitioners of exhalation and inhalation must proceed with care, lest the *qi* be misdirected.

All people are born with the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, which governs the body’s own primordial *qi*. With each exhalation and swallowing, the internal *qi* responds to the external *qi*, rising from the *qi* sea with the breath straight to the throat. At the moment of full exhalation, quickly close the mouth, forcefully swish the saliva, and swallow, causing a muffled sound as it gurgles down the left side. After twenty days, it will be as clear as water flowing into a pit. For women, it descends on the right. Thus, internal and external *qi* become distinctly separate.

Next, guide it with the mind and massage it with the hands, directing it into the *qi* sea, located three *cun* below the navel—also called the Lower *Dantian*. Beginners, whose upper passages are not yet open, may assist the descent with massage. Once the *qi* flows freely, massage is no longer necessary.

Upon closing the mouth, perform three consecutive swallows, called "cloud movement," while a single moist swallow is termed "rain bestowal." Beginners, whose *qi* does not yet flow freely, should proceed one swallow at a time, not rushing to three in succession. Once the *qi* flows smoothly, gradually increase the repetitions until, after a year of minor achievement, it circulates freely. After three years of practice, mastery is attained, and absorption may proceed without restraint.

If the *qi* is not yet flowing and a swallow does not descend, use a single swallow as a marker. With each swallow, exhale fully, then forcefully swish the mouth with slight effort, contracting the throat to swallow, ensuring a gurgling sound as it descends straight into the *qi* sea. Once this is clear, proceed to three consecutive swallows, and success will follow.

This method benefits the entire body and requires deep swallowing. Without prolonged dedication, how can one discern and fully grasp the truth? For those newly practicing *qi* absorption or long-time practitioners who have not yet mastered its subtleties, obtaining this method is most fortunate! Most fortunate indeed! But to transmit it lightly invites divine retribution. Beware! Beware!

Perform this facing east, repeating the cycle as before, following the established method.

**Method of Circulating Qi**

The method of circulating *qi* states: Behind the lower *dantian*, the two cavities along the spine connect to the spinal meridian, ascending to the *Niwan*. The *Niwan* is the palace of the brain.

With every three consecutive swallows, visualize the lower *dantian*. The primordial *qi* you have drawn in—guide it with intention into the two cavities. Then imagine two strands of white *qi* flanking the spine, ascending directly into the *Niwan*, steaming and suffusing all palaces. Suddenly, it descends through the hair, face, neck, nape, both arms, and fingers, entering the chest’s *dantian* and the heart, irrigating the five viscera. It then retraces its path to the lower *dantian*, flowing to *Sān Lǐ*, permeating the body, passing through the knees and ankles, and descending to *Yǒngquán* in the soles of the feet.

This is what is meant by "dividing the *qi* to govern it"—stirring it like thunder, moistening it like wind and rain. Just as heaven and earth possess springs, without thunder’s movement, *qi* cannot nourish and stir all things; just as the human body holds fluids, without swallowing and rinsing, there is no way to irrigate the five viscera and bestow radiance. Returning essence to replenish the brain requires union; without it, *qi* cannot ascend. Swallowing and absorbing internal *qi* requires exhalation and inhalation; without it, *qi* cannot be drawn forth and employed. To reverse the course of stagnation and grasp the principles of circulation is to model heaven and earth.

Visualize the turbid, stagnant, and pathogenic *qi*—along with congealed blood—being swept away by the upright *qi*, expelled through the tips of the hands and feet. This is called "dispersing *qi*." Extend the fingers without clenching them. Each such cycle constitutes one circulation. When circulation is achieved, *qi* blockages dissolve; once dissolved, regulate it to restore balance, then resume the practice of swallowing as before.

Holding the breath and stirring the *qi*, swallow thirty-six times—this is a minor accomplishment, the stage of abstaining from grains. At this point, one must eat sparingly, ensuring the abdomen remains empty and unconstrained. Whether sitting or lying down, whenever the stomach is empty, swallow. Practicing ten times a night naturally accumulates to three hundred and sixty swallows—this is called *major accomplishment*, the *Great Embryonic Breathing*. In *embryonic breathing*, simply hold the breath, counting to one thousand two hundred breaths—this too is called *major accomplishment*. However, even if one attains longevity, without refining form and transforming substance, one remains like withered wood, devoid of vitality.

There are also methods for refining *qi*, holding *qi*, releasing *qi*, and distributing *qi*, along with various essential techniques, listed below. Noble-minded practitioners who study and follow them will not err in the slightest.

**Method of Refining Qi**

The method of refining *qi* states: During breaks from *qi* absorption, enter a chamber, remove clothing, loosen the hair, and lie supine with hands extended, unclenched. Comb the hair to ensure it flows freely, then arrange it on the mat. Regulate the breath and swallow. Once done, hold the breath until the limit is reached, then empty the mind of all thoughts, allowing the *qi* to move as it will. If discomfort arises, exhale; if breathing becomes labored, regulate it. Once the breath is calm, refine it again. When *qi* flows smoothly, increase the count to twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty, until sweat permeates the entire body. This is the sign of its efficacy.

Calm the mind and harmonize the *qi*, then lie still without rising to avoid drafts—this is the finest art for preventing aging and prolonging life. Practice when the spirit is clear and the *qi* is refreshed; do not practice when drowsy. Regular practice is not required daily—only when one is particularly clear and invigorated. Perform it once every five or ten days.

As the *Huangting Jing* states: "A thousand disasters vanish, a hundred illnesses heal. One need not fear the ferocity of tigers and wolves, for this is the way to reverse aging and extend life."

**Method of Releasing Qi**

The method of releasing *qi* states: When the body’s *qi* is harmonious and the mind and spirit are at ease, whether sitting or lying down, one may practice this. Align with the door or window to regulate the breath, or sit in stillness, as if the spirit is absent, in profound tranquility, making the mind one with the vastness of space. Then hold ten or twenty breaths, allowing the *qi* to move freely without resistance from intention. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores, and exhalation will no longer be necessary. Even if one or two parts in ten remain, regulate it further, increasing to ten, a hundred, or more breaths.

Practice this whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. With diligent effort, all passages will open, the complexion will become radiant, and the *qi* will be clear and long, as if bathed. Whenever the body feels unwell, practice this—it will surely bring clarity and peace.

As the *Huangting Jing* says: "Sitting in noble repose, the hun and po are at peace; the pure and serene spirit appears and speaks with me."

**Method of Holding Qi**

The method of holding *qi* states: If, due to improper cultivation, illnesses arise, retreat to a secluded chamber. Arrange the hands and feet according to the method, regulate the breath, and swallow. Focus on the afflicted area, hold the breath, and direct the *qi* with intention to attack it. When the limit is reached, exhale, then swallow again and continue. If the *qi* becomes urgent, pause; once regulated, resume the attack. Repeat twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty times until the afflicted area sweats and becomes permeated—then stop. If not yet healed, practice this daily at midnight, before dawn, or during the day, repeatedly directing intention to attack until recovery.

Direct the *qi* to wherever the illness resides—whether in the head, face, hands, or feet—and there will be no ailment that does not heal. Knowing how to command *qi* to the hands and feet is as if wielding divine power—its efficacy is beyond words.

**Method of Distributing Qi**

The method of distributing *qi* states: When using *qi* to heal others, first determine the afflicted organ based on the patient’s condition, then draw *qi* from the corresponding direction and infuse it into the patient’s body. Have the patient face the direction, calm the mind, and quiet the thoughts. This method of distributing *qi* allows the patient to heal themselves, as they swallow the *qi* and focus on expelling the illness. Naturally, pathogenic *qi* will be eradicated forever. Once the upright *qi* is distributed, evil winds will retreat on their own.

**Method of the Six Qi**

The *Method of the Six Qi* states: The Six Qi are *yan*, *he*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*. Each of the Five Viscera governs one *qi*, while the remaining one resides in the Triple Burner. Together, they encompass all.

*Yan* pertains to the lungs and governs the nose. For disharmony of cold and heat or extreme fatigue, employ *yan* through exhalation and inhalation, and it will also regulate skin sores. Treat according to the condition, and healing will be immediate.

*He* pertains to the heart and governs the tongue. For dryness, roughness, or blockage of *qi*, as well as all pathogenic *qi*, expel them with *he*. For great heat, open the mouth wide; for slight heat, open it slightly. Adjust the degree with intention, and regulate accordingly—excess will cause harm.

*Hu* pertains to the spleen and governs the earth of the Central Palace. For mild heat or disharmony, abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnation, employ *hu* to regulate, and healing will follow.

*Xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes. For warmth or heat in the eyes, employ *xu* to regulate, and healing will be immediate.

*Chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears, waist, feet, and the decline of yang vitality. Employ *chui* to regulate, and healing will follow.

*Xi* pertains to the Triple Burner. For disharmony, employ *xi* to regulate.

Though the Six Qi each govern specific functions, when the Five Viscera, Triple Burner, extreme heat, or unregulated wind and pathogenic *qi* are involved, all fall under the heart’s domain. Employ *he* to regulate, and all ailments will heal—there is no need to use other *qi*.

All schools base their practices on this method, and its efficacy will be immediately apparent.

**Method of Regulating Fluids**

The *Method of Regulating Fluids* states: When one consumes the Five Flavors, each flavor returns to its corresponding viscus. The turbid *qi* of each viscus emerges through the mouth, as do the *qi* of the Six Bowels and Triple Burner, all converging at this gateway. The confluence of these impurities forms turbid *qi*. Upon waking from sleep, the foulness of this turbid *qi* is unbearable to the senses. Observe and examine it to know its timing.

When the mouth is dry and bitter, the tongue rough, the cheeks hot, saliva scant, or swallowing painful with an inability to eat, this is heat. Immediately open the mouth and employ *he*, ensuring the *qi* exits and enters through the proper "gates." After ten or twenty *he*, strike the Heavenly Drum seven or nine times, rinse the mouth with the fluid of the Flower Pool, swallow the saliva, and repeat *he*. Cease when the heat retreats. Wait until the mouth produces clear, sweet water—this signals the heat has receded and the Five Viscera are cooled.

If the mouth’s fluids are cold and bland, unable to retain water, this is cold. Employ the method of *chui* to regulate until the mouth feels pleasant and the heart harmonized, then cease.

The *Yellow Court Classic* states:
*"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root—*
*Those who cultivate it with care may endure forever."*
It also says:
*"Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamity at bay."*

---

**Method of Diet**

The *Method of Diet* states: After practicing *qi*-absorption, one must maintain order in nourishment. Among foods, some are beneficial, others harmful. Consume the beneficial and moderate the harmful—this sustains long-term practice.

Each morning at dawn, eat a small portion of plain watery congee, which is excellent for harmonizing spleen *qi* and replenishing fluids. At midday, consume bland, well-cooked dishes, including scallion and lotus root soup, glutinous rice, barley, or dried venison—all are beneficial. After eating, swallow three to five raw peppercorns, then swallow *qi* three to five times. This aids digestion, guides *qi* downward, unblocks the Triple Burner, harmonizes the Five Viscera, expels pathogenic *qi*, and assists upright *qi*. It is especially suitable for long-term practice, warding off cold, summerheat, and dampness, brightening the eyes, and harmonizing the center to regulate *qi*. Its benefits are too numerous to list in full. The *Upper Scroll of the Great Clarity Classic* contains further wondrous methods.

Avoid the twelve zodiacal animals, the thirty-six birds, and especially the zodiacal signs of one’s parents and one’s own birth year. Steamed buns disrupt upright *qi*. Fatty pork and raw vegetables obstruct the meridians. Melons, dates, chestnuts, taro, water caltrop, fox nut, river deer, wild geese, and pheasants may be eaten, but avoid their hearts, heads, and fats. During purification, abstain from all these entirely.

The immortal’s cultivated herb, known as *nan zhu* (Southern Candle Grass), grows in clusters of seventy-two stems, each with twenty-four branches, and five leaves per branch, corresponding to the seventy-two seasonal nodes, the Five Phases, and the twenty-four solar terms. It thrives on Mount Shaoshi in the east, the Southern Marchmount, and the Xiang River’s Zhonghua region. Eating it as gruel or decoction is excellent—there is no need to follow the *Great Clarity Classic*’s requirements; the herb alone suffices.

When eating, stop just before fullness; satiety harms the heart and hinders *qi* circulation. Also avoid radish soup, raw, cold, pungent, or spicy foods, sour or slippery textures, greasy or stale foods, and anything hard to digest. Be vigilant! If even a single mouthful of such foods is consumed, the affected area may ache slightly. Beware! Beware! Only soft foods are without concern.

After *qi*-absorption, if *qi* descends and causes bowel movements, do not suppress it—suppression leads to illness. Each morning on an empty stomach, drink a cup of fine clear wine as desired. In winter, warm it; in summer, it may be cool. This assists upright *qi* in expelling pathogens, but do not overindulge—excess leads to drunkenness, which harms the spirit and shortens life. If compelled by social obligations, drink sparingly, then employ *he* three to five times. For a full cup, open the mouth and employ *he* ten or more times to dispel the wine’s toxicity and regulate the body.

Ordinarily, two or three cups may be consumed daily, but on such days, one may drink up to a *dou* without becoming drunk, suffering no hangover, nor losing one’s appetite or reverting to old habits.

---

**Method of Regulation and Protection**

The *Method of Regulation and Protection* states: In practicing the arts of refinement and *qi*-absorption, avoid birthing chambers, funeral halls, the death and filth of livestock, and all impure or foul environments. The noxious *qi* of donkeys and horses should not be inhaled—how much less approached!

Upon encountering inauspicious or foul odors, immediately recite the *Purification Mantra*; otherwise, upright *qi* will be greatly harmed.

**Method of Regulation and Protection** (continued)

If unexpectedly encountering the aforementioned impurities, swiftly hold the breath, position oneself upwind, and hasten past to dispel them. Drinking two cups of wine to cleanse the system is also effective. Should foul *qi* enter and cause discomfort, immediately regulate the breath to expel it—do not retain it. If there is concern of counterflow *qi*, do not exhale; instead, swallow it down and draw in fresh *qi* to counter it. Once stabilized, assist with hand massage. Chewing Sichuan peppercorns and drinking one or two cups of wine will disperse it. If it does not disperse, it will not return to harmony, for this must stem from consuming greasy or impure foods that offend the upright *qi*.

Reflect carefully to discern the prior transgression—likely involving sorrow or chamber affairs. Do not err again. After one year of *qi*-absorption, the *qi* flows freely; after two years, it circulates; after three years, the work is complete. The primal *qi* then congeals into a mysterious pearl within the *dantian*. Even if transgressions occur, they cannot cause harm. Daily, one may swallow a thousand gulps without fear of excess, and thus reverse aging to regain youth. Here, *qi* transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into marrow.

In the first year, the *qi* is renewed; in the second, the blood; in the third, the vessels; in the fourth, the flesh; in the fifth, the marrow; in the sixth, the sinews; in the seventh, the bones; in the eighth, the hair; in the ninth, the form. Within ten years, thirty-six thousand spirits reside within the body, and one transforms into an immortal transcendent, known as a divine being. Diligently cultivate the Dao, refine *qi* into form, and transform form into spirit. When spirit and form unite, one ascends in broad daylight. The Dao’s numinous efficacy is proven—noble seekers of immortality, study this in detail. Persevere without cease, and the nature will open, the five viscera will be fortified.

As the *Huangting Jing* states: *"A thousand thousand, a hundred hundred, linked as one; ten by ten, like layered mountains."* The inner *qi* does not exit, the outer *qi* does not enter; cold and heat cannot invade, blades cannot harm. One ascends and transforms, attaining a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries, without end.

**Method of Fasting**

The *Method of Fasting* states: To cease reliance on grains, simply persist in prior diligent cultivation. After three years, the upright *qi* flows unimpeded, the body is robust, the bones are full, the hundred spirits guard their positions, and the Three Corpses flee. From this point, one no longer desires the scent of the five flavors. Constantly contemplating abstention, one may cease eating without difficulty. When hunger is felt, immediately swallow *qi*—regardless of time, without fixed limits. Over time, harmony is achieved, and the regimen becomes effortless. One may also supplement with medicinal substances.

Many who consume medicines do not practice *qi*-absorption, devoting their lives solely to herbs. Though they may attain something, this is not the focus of superior practitioners. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *"The grains’ essence is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure is foul and demonic. Their stench disturbs the spirit and scatters the fetal *qi*—how can one reverse aging to return to infancy? Why not consume the great harmony’s essence, and thus enter the Yellow Tranquility without dying?"*

**Method of Caution**

The *Method of Caution* states: Most people in the world indulge in desires, harming life and cutting short destiny—this has been so since ancient times. If one does not prepare early, what regret will suffice? As the *Scripture of Immortals* says: *"When a person nears death, they begin to cherish life; when sins are fixed, they think of reform; when illness is full-blown, they seek medicine. Yet the celestial truth has already scattered—how can it be retrieved?"* Thus, the wise and sagely cultivate life before danger arises, fear calamity before it strikes, and treat illness before it manifests. They shake off worldly dust, gather the mind, and return to the Dao.

The Dao is *qi*. *Qi* is the master of the body. Essence is the root of life. Cherishing essence and valuing *qi* may yet bring one close to longevity. The *Huangting Jing* says: *"Within the square inch of the heart, thoughts dwell deep in the viscera; the Three Spirits return, and the old regain youth."* And again: *"For long life, be most cautious in chamber affairs—why court death and make the spirits weep? Neglect leads to the Three Spirits’ demise. Instead, absorb *qi* and preserve essence. The inch-field and foot-dwelling can sustain life—if you breach the sea, a hundred streams will pour out; leaves fall, the tree withers, and verdancy is lost."* These are the prohibitions for nurturing the spirit.

All who seek long life and enduring vision must cherish essence and preserve *qi* to succeed. The Way of the Hundred Encounters with Yin is known to all, yet even those devoted to *qi* who do not abstain from desire will not escape peril. Thus it is said: *"People often lose the Dao, but the Dao does not lose people. People often depart from the Dao, but the Dao does not depart from people."* Cultivators should deeply reflect on this.

*Qi* is the Dao. The Dao is emptiness and origin. Emptiness and origin are the natural. The natural is the primordial act. The primordial act is the unmoving heart. The unmoving heart means the inner heart does not arise. When the inner heart does not arise, external conditions do not enter. Inner and outer are tranquil, the spirit is radiant, the spirit’s radiance harmonizes *qi*, and harmonized *qi* allows the primal *qi* to arrive naturally. When the primal *qi* arrives naturally, the five viscera are nourished; when the five viscera are nourished, the hundred vessels flow freely; when the hundred vessels flow freely, the fluids ascend in response. When the fluids ascend, the five flavors are no longer needed. With the five flavors ceased, hunger and thirst do not arise. When hunger and thirst do not arise, the Three Fields form the body, bones harden, flesh fills, and one reverses aging to regain youth—gradually, from this.

Here, *qi* transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into marrow. In the first year, the *qi* is renewed; in the second, the blood; in the third, the vessels; in the fourth, the flesh; in the fifth, the marrow; in the sixth, the sinews; in the seventh, the bones; in the eighth, the hair; in the ninth, the form. Thirty-six thousand spirits reside within, and one transforms into an immortal. This is the subtle mystery of the heart’s nature, the unfathomable principle of life.

When the five viscera are harmonious, fluids are generated; when the Three Burners are unobstructed, *qi* does not stagnate. This is the *Qiong* Elixir, not the mundane elixir of the world.

The spirit is the utmost numinous without form. Thus, the spirit is endowed by the Dao, quiescent and in accord with nature. Humans are endowed by the spirit, active and in accord with the passions. Therefore, following nature, the spirit congeals; with prolonged stillness, the spirit abides; with disturbance, the spirit strays. Abiding brings life; straying brings death—all shifted by the passions, not commanded by the spirit.

To practice *qi*-absorption, first sit in stillness. With focused awareness, ascend beyond the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. Further transcend the Great Beginning, the Great Simplicity, the Great Origin, the Great Ultimate, and the Great Height. Envision primordial *qi* descending and entering through the crown of the head, guiding it to the *yongquan* point. Sit upright, counting only the in-breath, not the out-breath. Use singular awareness to let primordial *qi* follow intention to the Three Fields, circulating like flowing water.

The *Scripture of Master Wang* states: "When primordial *qi* flows unimpeded, it is the Way of immortality." The perfected may comprehend this; the deluded are unworthy of discussion. Be cautious!

It further says: "Embryonic breathing guards the center, its name linked above with heaven. Practicing the Great Dao, one swiftly attains flight as an immortal." Guard this secret! Be cautious!

Guard this well!

**The Qi Scripture of Master Taiwu of Mount Song, Volume Two**
**Methods of Cultivation and Preservation**

For all who practice embryonic breathing, the method begins by clicking the teeth thirty-six times to gather the myriad spirits. Then, rotate the neck once in a full circle. When the embryonic breath is complete, swallow it through the throat—do this three times. Next, rub the tongue inside and outside the mouth, churning the Jade Nectar until it fills the mouth. Rinse and swirl it, then tilt the head back and swallow.

This nourishes the Muddy Pellet above and moistens the Five Viscera below. At midnight and the fifth watch, stretch the legs, clench the fists, and extend both hands five inches from the body. The pillow should be three inches high. Close the eyes and swallow according to the previous method.

After washing and grooming, warm a cup of wine and drink it. Embryonic breathing nourishes the Six Bowels, while wine guides the qi to moisten the hundred passages.

The Sage says: Man dwells within qi, and qi dwells within man. Man does not depart from qi, nor qi from man. Man relies on qi to live; when qi scatters, man dies. The principle of life and death lies entirely within qi—simply refine and cultivate the primordial qi, and one cannot die.

Master Wang says: With long practice, one cannot die. This is what is meant. Lord Lao says: Sweet rain moistens the myriad things, while embryonic fluid moistens the hundred parts of the body. *The Yellow Court Classic* states: "Awake day and night to attain the True." Above, this leads to transcendence as an immortal; below, it extends one’s lifespan. For all illnesses in the body, visualize qi attacking them, and the ailment will immediately be cured. As true qi expels turbid qi downward, one will feel the spirit refreshed and the demeanor harmonious and serene.

Lord Lao says: The numinous valley and jade essence reside within one’s own body. Though the famous mountains and great marshes yield herbs for ingestion that can nourish the upright qi, relying solely on them deviates from the Dao. If one practices embryonic breathing without disturbance for a long time, the qi will naturally become complete and truly wondrous, ascending without need of wings.

The embryo conceals the infant, who clenches firmly to ingest primordial qi. This clenching is the question between Heaven and Earth. To clench is like closing the heart’s gate, so that no perverse qi may enter. The infant clenches firmly because, within the mother’s womb, it drinks primordial qi—hence the name "embryonic breathing." When united with the original primordial qi, it remains unmoved and unshaken, naturally free from hunger and thirst.

Those who study the primordial embryo: if holding the breath becomes stifling, gently exhale the turbid qi, expelling it with a sigh, then promptly close again. Constantly guard the primordial qi, and wondrous attainment will naturally follow.

Man’s body is endowed by primordial qi; it must be replenished with the primordial embryo. Thus it is said: Preserve the primordial qi, and this is called the natural return of the elixir, stepping into emptiness. It is said: The qi of profound emptiness and great harmony, inhaling and exhaling the flowing rosy mist. Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages, in solitude exploring the three conveniences. The Muddy Pellet becomes a luminous mirror, and one attains the Golden Flower Immortal.

It is also said: Constantly contemplate consuming primordial essence, refining the fluid to secure the bodily form. Those who study the Dao must always contain primordial qi, embracing and rinsing with flowing rosy mist, filling and irrigating the organs and bowels, moistening the bones and joints, reversing the decline of withered years and restoring the joyful countenance of youth. Through exhalation and inhalation, the visage is transformed—without refining the fluid, this would not be so.

When embryonic breathing rises to the throat, what serves as its sign? The rumbling of thunder signals the presence of embryonic breathing. Clenching firmly should also be practiced constantly.

Below the throat lie the Twelve Towers; when embryonic qi ascends to the head and is swallowed, this is called the method of replenishing the brain. Guard this secret!

Thus it is said: When hungry, consume the qi of great harmony and nature—this is embryonic breathing. When thirsty, drink the nectar of the Flowery Pond—the saliva in the mouth. Returning this fluid to irrigate the Spirit Gate and moisten the Kidney Palace, the jade liquid is sweet and should be carefully preserved.

The Five Viscera correspond above to the constellations and below to the Five Phases; they must always be preserved with purity and clarity.

**Method of Caution Regarding Grain**
**Method of Caution Regarding Qi**

As for the principle of qi: it is difficult to secure when taken in and easy to exhaust when expelled. What is difficult to secure must be preserved; what is easy to exhaust must be concealed and not leaked.

The Perfected One says: Studying the Dao is like remembering a morning meal—there is none who does not attain it. Cherishing qi is like cherishing one’s own face—there is none who does not preserve it whole. It is also said: If one cherishes qi as the foremost priority of the body, I have rarely seen one wither and decline.

In social interactions, speech, and laughter, one must be sparing and restrained. In movement and shouting, one must be measured and gentle. Be cautious in all matters, and one may avoid harm.

Man’s body unites with Heaven and Earth, blending yin and yang qi. Skin, bones, marrow, bowels, viscera, constructive and defensive qi, breathing and movement, the changes of cold and heat—none differ from the Two Modes and Five Phases.

Thus, when Heaven and Earth are in disharmony, the qi of yin and yang becomes chaotic; when the viscera and bowels are unbalanced, the signs of the meridians fall ill. External cold and heat give rise to illness through wind, while the causes of the hundred diseases arise from qi.

Thus it is said: Serene and empty, without desire, true qi follows. With spirit guarded within, whence can illness come? Therefore, one must know how to harmonize and preserve the body and spirit through nature, carefully discerning internal and external illnesses.

Man has three Cinnabar Fields, corresponding to the Three Origins—upper, middle, and lower. The Upper Cinnabar Field is the Muddy Pellet, the Brain Palace; its spirit is the Red Child, named Yuanxian, also called Imperial Minister. This spirit wears red robes and a cap, governing the Upper Origin.

The Middle Cinnabar Field is the Crimson Palace of the heart; its Perfected One is named Zidan, also called Central Radiance and Firmness. This spirit wears red robes and a cap, governing the Middle Origin.

The Lower Cinnabar Field is below the navel, the Sea of Qi and Gate of Essence; its spirit is the Infant, named Yuanyang, also called Mysterious Below the Valley. This spirit wears red robes and a cap, governing the Lower Origin.

These Three Cinnabar Fields correspond to the Three Origins, each containing a spirit. If they are depleted, qi leaks and essence is lost; when essence is lost, qi scatters.

Essence is the root of the body. The root is the position of qi; when essence is whole, qi is whole; when essence is lost, qi is lost. Only essence and qi must be preserved whole.

It is also said: Essence can consume qi, and form can consume flavor. When swallowing qi, it must not be mixed with saliva; saliva must be swallowed separately. If mixed with saliva, it may invite wind and cause illness in the abdomen. When swallowing saliva, wait for the exhalation to do so—this is especially wondrous.
