**Preface to *The Record of Nurturing Life and Extending Lifespan***

All beings endowed with *qi* and spirit are noble, yet none surpass humanity in worth. What humanity holds most dear is life itself. Life is the root of spirit, while form is its vessel. When spirit is overtaxed, it is exhausted; when form is overburdened, it perishes. If one can still the mind in emptiness and tranquility, quieting thoughts through non-action, absorb primordial *qi* after midnight, and practice *daoyin* in a secluded chamber, nurturing life without neglect while supplementing with fine medicines, then a lifespan of a hundred years is but the natural allotment. Yet those who indulge in sensual pleasures, exhaust their wit in pursuit of wealth and rank, cling to gains and losses in their hearts, or remain restless and unable to free themselves—who disregard propriety and moderation in diet—how can such as these escape the calamity of premature death?

In moments of respite from meditation, I have perused *The Essential Collection of Nurturing Life*. This compilation was assembled by scholars such as Qian Yan and Zhang Zhan of the Daoist groves, alongside Qi Ping and Huang Shan—all keen and extraordinary minds devoted to preserving and cultivating life. Some gathered the precepts of immortals and perfected beings on longevity, while others adopted the arts of Peng Keng and the Old Lord for extending years. From the time of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor down to the Wei and Jin dynasties, whatever benefited nurturing life or risked harm to later years was recorded in the original texts. Here, I have distilled the essential methods, pruned the excess, and organized them into thematic sections, dividing the work into two fascicles with three chapters each. Entitled *The Record of Nurturing Life and Extending Lifespan*, this work aims to aid those with affinity for such teachings, hoping thereby to benefit all beings.

Some claim this book was compiled by Sun Simiao.

**Fascicle One of *The Record of Nurturing Life and Extending Lifespan***
Compiled by Tao the Recluse of Huayang

**Chapter One: Teachings and Admonitions**

The *Divine Farmer’s Classic* states: Those who eat grains gain wisdom and clarity. Those who consume minerals grow plump and lustrous, never aging—this refers to refining the Five Minerals. Those who eat *zhi* mushrooms extend their years without dying. Those who ingest primordial *qi* cannot be buried by earth or slain by heaven. Thus, those who consume medicinal substances differ from heaven, standing alongside the sun and moon.

The *Daoist Scripture of Primordial Unity* states: The valley spirit does not die. Master Heshang says: *Gu* means nurturing; to nurture the spirit is to avoid death. The spirit governs the five viscera. The liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the spirit, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores will. When the five viscera are all damaged, the five spirits depart. This is called the Mysterious Female. It speaks of the undying Dao, which lies in the Mysterious Female. *Xuan* is heaven, and in humans, it is the nose. *Pin* is earth, and in humans, it is the mouth. Heaven feeds humans with the five *qi*, which enter through the nose and are stored in the heart. The five *qi* are pure and subtle, becoming spirit, intelligence, voice, and the five natures. Their ghost is called the *hun*. The *hun* is yang; it enters and exits through the human nose, communicating with heaven—thus the nose is *xuan*. Earth feeds humans with the five flavors, which enter through the mouth and are stored in the stomach. The five flavors are turbid and stagnant, forming the body’s frame, bones, flesh, blood vessels, and the six emotions. Their ghost is called the *po*. The *po* is yin; it enters and exits through the mouth, communicating with earth—thus the mouth is *pin*. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. *Root* means origin. It speaks of the gates of the nose and mouth, which are the source of the primordial *qi* of heaven and earth, through which it comes and goes. It is continuous as if existing, yet the breath of the nose and mouth should be soft and subtle, as if present yet also as if absent. In using it, one must not be hasty. When employing *qi*, one should be relaxed and unhurried, not urgent, hurried, or laborious.

The *Hunyuan Daode Jing* states: "Birth" means that emotions and desires emerge from the five viscera, the *hun* is settled and the *po* is tranquil—thus life arises. "Entering death" means that emotions and desires penetrate the chest and diaphragm, essence scatters and spirit is deluded—thus death ensues. Those who follow life number thirteen; those who follow death number thirteen. This speaks of the categories of life and death, each numbering thirteen, which are called the nine chambers and four gates.

In life, the eyes do not recklessly gaze, the ears do not recklessly listen, the nose does not recklessly inhale, the mouth does not recklessly speak, the hands do not recklessly grasp, the feet do not recklessly walk, and essence is not recklessly expended. In death, the opposite holds true.

As humans live, all their movements lead to the thirteen paths of death. Those who seek life yet act contrary to this reach the thirteen paths of death. Why is this so? Because their pursuit of life is too excessive. The reason their movements lead to death is that their striving for life is overly intense. Departing from the Dao and rebelling against heaven, reckless actions lose their proper order.

It is said that those who skillfully nurture life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor are they harmed by weapons when entering battle. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger has nowhere to place its claws, and weapons have nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this so? Because they avoid the paths of death—because they do not transgress the thirteen paths of death.

The *Zhuangzi*’s "Nourishing Life" chapter states: "Our life has limits," to which Xiang Xiu comments: "The scope of life, each with its own bounds." "Yet knowledge has no limits." Ji Kang says: "To desire without reflection is the movement of nature. To recognize and then respond is the function of knowledge. When nature moves, encountering things appropriately suffices, leaving no surplus of knowledge; following sensations without seeking, one becomes weary yet does not cease." Thus, the world’s afflictions lie in the exhaustion of knowledge, not in the movement of nature.

"To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous," as Guo Xiang notes: "Using a finite nature to chase boundless knowledge, how can one not be exhausted?" "Having already exhausted oneself through knowledge, to then employ knowledge to attack it is yet more perilous," as Xiang Xiu says: "Already exhausted by knowledge, to further employ knowledge is yet more perilous."

The *Zhuangzi* states: "Those who comprehend the essence of life do not strive for what life cannot provide," to which Xiang Xiu comments: "What life cannot provide are the affairs of nature." Zhang Zhan adds: "When the principle of life is naturally preserved, to pursue what lies beyond one’s allotted share is to chase the limitless with the limited."

"Those who comprehend the essence of fate do not strive for what knowledge cannot control," as Xiang Xiu says: "This refers to death when one’s fate is exhausted." Zhang Zhan notes: "Following the principle of life’s natural course and exhausting one’s allotted span, how can knowledge know what lies beyond?"

The *Liezi* states: "In youth, do not neglect diligent practice; in adulthood, do not fail to seize the moment; in maturity, be content with poverty; in old age, reduce desires. Calm the mind and labor the body—this is the method of nurturing life."

The *Liezi* further states: "The fullness and emptiness of the body’s unity ebb and flow in harmony with heaven and earth, responding to the myriad things." Zhang Zhan comments: "Humans share *qi* with yin and yang." "Harmonize it at the beginning, harmonize it at the end; still the spirit and extinguish thoughts—this is the Dao of life. When beginning and end are harmonized, the spirit and will do not scatter."

The *Hunyuan Miaozhen Jing* states: "Humans often lose the Dao, not the Dao losing humans. Humans often depart from life, not life departing from humans. Thus, those who mingle with life must be cautious not to lose the Dao. Those who practice the Dao must be cautious not to lose life, ensuring that the Dao and life guard each other, and life and the Dao preserve one another."

The *Huanglao Jing Xuanshi* states: "The Dao of heaven enacts transformation, enduring with the myriad things without end. The Dao of humans enacts transformation, yet form and spirit perish. To circulate spirit and expend essence—when essence is exhausted, decay follows. Form fundamentally generates essence, and essence arises from spirit. Not expending life’s resources, one can thus unite virtue with heaven. Not transforming with spirit, one can thus align with the Dao’s pattern."

The *Xuanshi* further states: "Those who transform through form belong to the category of corpse liberation. Spirit and form separate, and the two do not remain together, like birds flying into the sea and becoming clams, following the yin and yang *qi* of late autumn. Those who transform through *qi* may yet hope for life; those who transform through form are deeply to be feared."

Yan Junping’s *Laozi Zhigui* states: "Let the mind wander in emptiness and stillness, focus the will on the subtle and wondrous, entrust thoughts to desirelessness, and return plans to non-action—thus one can comprehend life, extend lifespan, and endure with the Dao."

The *Dayou Jing* states: Some doubt, saying: "All begin equally from the boundless, receive *qi* from yin and yang, bear form and *po* in heaven and earth, and rely on sustenance and breath for growth—yet there are the foolish and the wise, the strong and the weak, the long-lived and the short-lived. Is this heaven’s doing or man’s?" The explanation is: "Whether one’s form is foolish or wise is determined by heaven. Strength, weakness, long life, or early death are determined by humans. The Dao of heaven is natural; the Dao of humans is self-made."

"Those whose fetal *qi* is full at the beginning, whose milk and food are abundant in infancy, whose nourishment is sufficient in youth, and whose sounds and colors are moderate in adulthood will be strong and long-lived. Those whose fetal *qi* is depleted at the beginning, whose milk and food are insufficient in infancy, whose nourishment is excessive in youth, and whose sounds and colors are unrestrained in adulthood will be weak and short-lived. If one’s growth is complete and nurtured with proper guidance, one’s years cannot be measured."

The *Daoji* states: "That human lifespans vary in length is not natural; it is all due to carelessness in self-preservation, immoderate eating and drinking, excessive indulgence, acting contrary to yin and yang, the *hun* and spirit not being guarded, essence being exhausted and life declining, and the hundred diseases sprouting—thus one does not complete one’s natural lifespan."

The *Hetu Dishi Meng* states: "Those who defy the seasons meet misfortune; those who follow the seasons meet good fortune. In spring and summer, delight in high mountains; in autumn and winter, dwell in low, secluded places. This brings good fortune, abundant blessings, and boundless longevity."

The *Weishu Baoyu Ming* states: "The methods of the ancients for treating illness involved harmonizing with sweet springs, moistening with primordial *qi*, using medicines neither pungent nor bitter but sweet and flavorful, and taking them regularly. This caused fluids to flow through the five viscera, connect to the heart and lungs, and ensure lifelong freedom from illness."

The *Kongzi Jiayu* states: "Those who eat meat are brave and fierce, like tigers and wolves. Those who consume *qi* are spiritually luminous and long-lived, like immortals and sacred turtles. Those who eat grains are wise but short-lived—such is man. Those who eat nothing do not die and become spirits, relying solely on breath without thought or care."

The *Commentary* says: "Those of mixed diet attract the hundred diseases and malevolent spirits. The less one eats, the more the mind opens and the years increase; the more one eats, the more the mind is obstructed and the years diminish."

The Grand Historian Sima Tan said: "The spirit is the root of life; the body is its vessel. Excessive use of the spirit exhausts it; excessive labor of the body destroys it. When spirit and body prematurely decline, to desire longevity like heaven and earth is unheard of. Thus, what enables man to live is the spirit; what the spirit relies upon is the body. When spirit and body part, death ensues—once dead, one cannot revive; once parted, they cannot reunite. Therefore, the sage values this deeply.

The Dao of nurturing life has a unifying principle, though few fully grasp its essence. Yet if one merely considers how to oppose common customs, one treads the path of victory, gaining more than half the benefit. Those with intent—can they not reflect on this?"

The *Xiaoyou Jing* states: "Few thoughts, few intentions, few desires, few affairs, few words, few laughs, few sorrows, few joys, few likes, few dislikes, few attachments, few aversions—practicing these twelve *fews* is the comprehensive key to nurturing life. Excessive thought endangers the spirit; excessive intention scatters the will; excessive desire harms resolve; excessive affairs fatigue the body; excessive speech depletes *qi*; excessive laughter injures the viscera; excessive sorrow cowers the heart; excessive joy overflows the mind; excessive delight leads to forgetfulness, errors, and chaos; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive attachment leads to obsession and disorder; excessive aversion brings emaciation and joylessness. Failing to eliminate these twelve *excesses* is the root of life’s ruin. Those who avoid excess approach the great plan of the perfected.

The extravagant and indolent live long; the strange and diligent die young—such is the difference between dissipation and stinginess. Farmers live long; the pampered die young—such is the proof of few or many desires. Recluses fall ill rarely; wanderers suffer often—such is the divergence of simplicity and complexity. Thus, worldly men compete for profit, while Daoists seldom scheme."

Hu Zhao said: "The eyes should not gaze upon improper colors; the ears should not listen to foul words; the nose should not face rank odors; the mouth should not taste poisonous or pungent flavors; the heart should not plot deceitful schemes—these bring disgrace to the spirit and shorten life. Moreover, sighing habitually or wailing day and night invites misfortune and invites evil. Ordinary people cannot be without desires or affairs, but one should harmonize the mind, reduce thoughts, calm the body, and lessen worries. First, eliminate what disturbs the spirit and violates nature—this is one method of conserving the spirit."

The *Huangting Jing* states: "Wash the spiritual root with the clear waters of the Jade Pool; those who cultivate this may endure forever. This is called *natural* eating and drinking. *Natural* refers to the Flowery Pool—the saliva in the mouth. When breath is regulated and swallowed, hunger ceases."

The *Laojun Yinshi Neijie* says: "Saliva transforms into sweet springs, gathers as jade nectar, flows as the Flowery Pool, scatters as floating essence, and descends as sweet dew. Thus, the mouth is the Flowery Pool, containing sweet springs. Rinsing and swallowing it moistens the viscera, nourishes the body, benefits the hundred vessels, and sustains the myriad spirits, joints, and hair—life arises from this."

The *Zhong Jing* states: "The tranquil live long; the restless die young. Tranquility that cannot nurture may still grant longevity; restlessness that is cultivated can extend years. Yet tranquility is easy to govern, while restlessness is hard to manage. Those who fully follow the proper methods of nurture may cultivate both tranquility and restlessness."

Han Rong Yuanchang said: "Wine is the essence of the five grains, the pinnacle of flavor—yet it can also harm. Fine things are hard to manage and easy to overindulge in; one must be cautious in nurturing life."

Shao Zhongzhan said: "The five grains fill the body but cannot extend life; the hundred medicines cure illness and prolong years but are not palatable. What is palatable and fills the body is prized by worldly men; what is bitter and extends life is treasured by Daoists."

The *Suwen* states: The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: "I have heard that the people of high antiquity lived to a hundred years without decline in movement—was their blood and *qi* still abundant? Yet today, people begin to decline at fifty—is this due to the times, or have men lost the way?"

Qi Bo replied: "The people of high antiquity who understood the Dao modeled themselves on yin and yang, harmonized with arts and calculations, and followed the methods of chamber arts. Their eating and drinking were moderated, their rising and resting were regulated, and they did not act recklessly. Thus, they could accompany the spirit, fulfill their natural lifespan, and live beyond a hundred years. Today’s people are not so: they take wine as broth, treat recklessness as normal, enter the chamber while drunk, exhaust their essence with desire, dissipate their true *qi* with indulgence, fail to maintain fullness, do not timely manage the spirit, seek to please the heart, and wander in yin and yang. Their daily life and conduct lack moderation—thus they decline at fifty."

Laozi said: "Man’s great term is a hundred years as the limit; those who regulate and protect it may reach a thousand. It is like using oil—whether on a small or large lamp. While the crowd speaks grandly, I speak softly; while the crowd is troubled, I remember little; while the crowd is violent, I do not anger. I do not burden my mind with worldly affairs or pursue official rank. Serene and effortless, my spirit and *qi* fill naturally—this is the medicine of immortality, unknown to the world. Do not say the unseen is obscure; heaven knows the hearts of men."

"Do not dismiss the unseen as obscure—spirits perceive human form. Whispered words in the heart, ghosts hear human voice. Violate a thousand prohibitions, and the earth claims one’s body.

Man performs yang goodness, and good people repay it. Man performs yin goodness, and ghosts and spirits repay it. Man commits yang evil, and bandits or men punish him. Man commits yin evil, and ghosts and spirits punish him. Thus, heaven does not deceive man—it responds like a shadow; earth does not deceive man—it echoes like a sound.

Laozi said: Those who cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue yet encounter misfortune suffer the lingering calamities of their ancestors; those who violate prohibitions and commit evil yet encounter fortune inherit the residual blessings of their ancestors.

*The Treatise on Illnesses by Renowned Physicians* states: People do not live out their natural lifespan but often die prematurely, all because they fail to cherish themselves—indulging in anger, contention, and unbridled desires, pursuing fame and profit, amassing toxins to assault the spirit, internally injuring the marrow, externally wasting the sinews and flesh. When blood and *qi* are nearly depleted, the meridians become obstructed, the flesh and texture grow porous, and only demonic illnesses are invited. True *qi* wanes daily, while pathogenic *qi* waxes. This is no different from pouring the vast ocean into a flickering flame or collapsing a towering peak to dam a trickling stream—easier said than done, yet far worse than these.

Pengzu said: The Dao is not in complexity. Simply refrain from thinking of clothing, food, sound, color, victory, defeat, loss, gain, honor, or disgrace. Let the heart not labor, the body not exhaust itself, and regularly practice *daoyin*, absorb *qi*, and embrace embryonic breathing—thus one may attain a thousand years. Those who seek boundless longevity must ingest the supreme medicine.

Zhongchang Tong said: Dissolve the six emotions and five natures; have a heart yet not think with it, a mouth yet not speak with it, a body yet not rest in it. Find peace in what is peaceful yet remain unattached; delight in what is delightful yet feel no love. Pursue this path, and one will not notice the days lengthening or things changing. Such was the way of Pengzu and Laozi—how else could they, though of the same kind as others, attain lifespans unlike others?

Chen Jiyuanfang said: Most illnesses and premature deaths stem from diet. The harm of diet surpasses that of sensual indulgence. Sensual pleasures may be cut off for years, but diet cannot be abandoned for a single day. Its benefits are great, yet so are its harms. Excess injures, moderation nourishes.

Zhang Zhan said: Those who suddenly lose wealth and status, though not struck by external evil, suffer internal spiritual injury and will surely die—not from external demonic harm, but from the inner searing of ice and fire, leading to collapse, internal damage, and vomiting blood. Those who rise to riches then fall into poverty, though not struck by external evil, will see their skin wither, sinews protrude, and limbs contract and twist. The harm of wealth and poverty to man is like that of power and status—diseases and afflictions merely wear away the body.

Movement overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. To be capable of both movement and stillness is the way to longevity. When essence and *qi* are pure and tranquil, they merge with the Dao.

*Zhuangzi* said: The true person does not dream in sleep.
*Shenzi* said: One who has no affairs by day will not dream at night.

Daoist Master Zhang, over a hundred years old, was remarkably robust. He said: The way of nurturing life lies in avoiding prolonged walking, sitting, standing, gazing, or listening; avoiding excessive eating and drinking, deep intoxication, great sorrow, or profound grief—this is what it means to achieve harmony. Those who attain harmony will surely live long.

*The Scripture of Immortals* states: My life is in my hands, not in heaven’s. Yet fools do not understand this. The Dao is the essence of life; the causes of all illnesses and pathogenic winds lie in indulging desires and emotions without self-restraint, leading to depletion and harm. Like withered, rotten wood that snaps in the wind or a crumbling bank that collapses at the first touch of water, if one cannot take medicine, merely treasuring essence and moderating emotions may still grant a lifespan of one or two hundred years.

Zhang Zhan’s *Collected Writings on Nurturing Life* states: The great essentials of nurturing life are: first, conserve the spirit; second, cherish *qi*; third, nurture the body; fourth, practice *daoyin*; fifth, regulate speech; sixth, moderate diet; seventh, harmonize the bedchamber; eighth, counter convention; ninth, use medicine; tenth, observe prohibitions. Beyond these, further principles may be briefly noted.

The Daoist of the Green Ox said: Do not seek to please others, for those who please others do not live long. Simply avoid straining beyond one’s strength. Lifting heavy weights, drawing strong bows, digging earth, or laboring to exhaustion without rest leads to the fatigue and depletion of sinews and bones. Yet labor and toil are preferable to idleness and pleasure. From dawn to dusk, one should always be engaged in some activity, pausing only when utterly spent, then resuming after rest. This is no different from *daoyin*. Flowing water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot because they are constantly in motion.

After eating, do not sit or stand idly—walk and move to disperse the food. Otherwise, one will suffer from undigested accumulations, numbness in the limbs, facial pallor, and a shortened lifespan.

Huangfu Long asked the Daoist of the Green Ox—whose surname was Feng and given name Junda—about his method of nurturing life. The general principles were: Keep the body regularly active, eat sparingly, avoid overexertion, prevent excessive depletion, reduce rich and heavy foods, limit salt and sour flavors, curb thoughts, temper joy and anger, abandon reckless pursuits, and be cautious in the bedchamber. Emperor Wu practiced this and found it effective.

Pengzu said: Though one may not know the methods, simply nurturing life with reason can grant a lifespan of a hundred and twenty years. Those who fall short do so through self-injury. With a slight understanding of the Dao, one may live two hundred and forty years; with the addition of medicinal aids, four hundred and eighty years."

Ji Kang also said: When guiding and nurturing life with reason, one may live a thousand years at best, or a hundred years at least.

Pengzu said: The method of nurturing longevity is simply to avoid harm. Winter warmth and summer coolness, maintaining harmony with the four seasons—this is how one adapts the body.

Pengzu said: Heavy clothing and thick bedding, leaving the body idle and untested, invite wind and cold illnesses. Rich flavors, cured meats, drunkenness, and overindulgence lead to accumulations and obstructions. Alluring beauty and a house full of concubines bring depletion and ruin. Seductive sounds and mournful music, though pleasing to the heart and ear, lead to dissipation and delusion. Galloping excursions and hunting on the plains result in reckless madness. Scheming for victory, seizing the weak, and exploiting disorder breed arrogance and idleness—these are the failings even of sages and worthies. Yet the tools of nurturing life, like fire and water, must not be misused, lest they become harmful.

Pengzu said: Those who do not understand the Dao may take medicines recklessly, damaging their blood and qi, leaving their flesh porous and marrow hollow. Already weakened within, they are then assailed by external influences—wind, cold, wine, and lust—bringing forth illness. If one’s foundation were full and firm, how could disease arise?

An immortal said: No sin is greater than lust, no calamity greater than greed, no fault greater than slander. These three are the chariots of misfortune: in small measure, they endanger the person; in great measure, they endanger the family. Those who wish to prolong life and minimize illness must never squander essence to the point of premature decay, never indulge in excessive warmth to the point of consuming the marrow, never endure extreme cold to the point of harming the flesh, never cough or spit to the point of losing vital fluids, never gasp suddenly to the point of startling the soul, never weep long to the point of grieving the spirit, never rage to the point of distressing the mind, never brood to the point of mental confusion. Those who can follow this Dao may attain long life.

**Dietary Admonitions, Chapter Two**

A Perfected One said: Though one may take medicines regularly, without knowing the art of nurturing life, it is still difficult to attain longevity. The Way of nurturing life abhors eating to fullness and then immediately exerting oneself, as well as sitting for long periods—both shorten life. One should engage in light labor, but never to the point of exhaustion or beyond one’s capacity. After eating, one should stroll leisurely, finding joy in some activity. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, nor do door hinges rot, for they are in constant motion. Therefore, one should not eat at night. After a meal, one should walk in the courtyard as if covering several *li*—this is excellent. Eating to fullness and then lying down breeds a hundred illnesses, as undigested food accumulates. Eat little but often, avoiding large, hard-to-digest meals. Maintain a state of being neither too full nor too hungry—always as if slightly sated in hunger, slightly hungry in satiety.

Thus, those who nurture life eat only when truly hungry and drink only when truly thirsty. If one waits until ravenous to eat, the meal will be excessive; if one waits until parched to drink, the intake will be too great. After eating, one should walk, and after walking, have someone massage the abdomen with powder for several hundred strokes—this is greatly beneficial.

The Daoist of the Green Ox said: Do not eat to excess; thus, the Daoist eats only when hungry. Do not drink to excess; thus, the Daoist drinks only when thirsty. After eating, walk several hundred steps—this is most beneficial. After the evening meal, walk about five *li* before lying down, and illness will be dispelled.

In eating, first consume hot foods, then warm, then cold. After eating hot or warm foods, if no cold food is available, swallow one or two mouthfuls of cold water—this is most effective. If one can remember this constantly, it is a key method of nurturing life.

Before eating, lightly inhale and swallow the qi once or twice—this prevents illness.

A Perfected One said: Hot food harms the bones, cold food harms the organs. Hot things scald the lips, cold things pain the teeth. After eating, pacing about promotes longevity. Do not speak loudly after a full meal. Drinking heavily blocks the blood vessels; drunkenness scatters the spirit.

In spring, eat pungent foods; in summer, sour; in autumn, bitter; in winter, salty. These all assist the five viscera, enrich the blood and qi, and ward off illness. Yet even sour, salty, sweet, and bitter foods must not be consumed to excess.

Do not eat liver in spring, heart in summer, lungs in autumn, kidneys in winter, or spleen in any of the four seasons. If one can avoid these five viscera, it is especially harmonious with Heaven’s principle.

Swallows must not be eaten, for they may be swallowed by dragons and serpents in water; nor should they be killed.

Eating to fullness and then exposing oneself to the elements causes back pain. Do not drink too much alcohol, for excess leads to vomiting, which is harmful.

After drinking, do not stand in the wind or use a fan—both harm the person.

Do not eat honey with plums, as it harms the five viscera.

Do not force oneself to eat while drunk, as it may cause paralysis, abscesses, or sores.

Sexual intercourse while drunk and full may cause facial blemishes and coughing; in severe cases, it may rupture the visceral channels and shorten life.

In eating, it is best to keep food consistently warm, as it is easily digested—better than habitual cold food.

In all eating, cooked is better than raw, and less is better than more.

Eating to fullness and then riding a horse may cause mental derangement.

Do not gulp water hastily, as it may cause qi disorders or water accumulation.

Do not eat cheese after consuming yogurt, as it may turn to blood phlegm or bloody urine.

After eating hot food, do not wash the face if sweating, as it causes loss of complexion and a sensation like insects crawling on the skin.

After eating hot food, do not rinse the mouth with vinegar or fermented grain water, as it causes bad breath and bleeding gums.

Horse sweat, breath, or hair entering food can also harm a person.

Do not eat parrot, rabbit, or dog meat together.

Cured meat soaked by water dripping from a rotting thatched roof is called "depressed cured meat"—eating it harms the person.

After prolonged hunger, do not eat to fullness, as it may cause accumulation disorders.

Eating to fullness and then exposing oneself at night without covering may cause sudden death from cholera.

After recovering from an illness, do not eat raw fish, as it may cause unending dysentery.

Do not eat dairy products after raw fish, as it may breed worms.

Do not eat dried ginger after rabbit meat, as it may cause cholera.

When eating meat, do not select the fattiest portion from the top, for if many have already gazed upon it, the eater may develop *qi* stagnation or *zheng* and *li* disorders—this applies to all foods.

Do not eat raw fruit on an empty stomach, as it causes heat above the diaphragm, consumptive fever, and paralysis.

Covering food with copper vessels causes condensation to drip into the food, and eating it leads to sores and deep abscesses.

Eating hot food while still chilled from cold exposure may cause piercing wind.

Do not wash your face with cold water while still heated from drinking alcohol, as it causes facial sores.

Do not wash your hair after eating to fullness, as it leads to head wind.

Eating barley with pork for more than three meals generates heat wind.

Do not store dried cured meat among glutinous rice, as eating it obstructs the *qi*.

If dried cured meat does not move when burned over fire but only stirs after being removed, and upon tearing it reveals intertwined sinews, eating it harms or even kills the person.

If a sheep’s shoulder blade contains flesh resembling pearls, called "suspended sinew," eating it causes epilepsy.

Eating any damp food that does not cast a reflection causes *zheng* disorders and abdominal distension.

After sudden illness, drinking alcohol without restraint generates heat above the diaphragm.

After recovering from illness, do not eat raw jujubes, mutton, or raw vegetables, as it damages the complexion permanently, often leading to death, and causes steaming heat above the diaphragm.

After eating hot, greasy pastries, do not drink cold vinegar or fermented grain water, as it may cause loss of voice or throat obstruction.

Eating raw scallions with honey harms the person.

Beware of dried cured meat that moves on its own when exposed to water—it kills.

Do not eat jerky that refuses to dry when sun-cured.

Do not eat sheep’s liver with Sichuan pepper, as it harms the heart.

Eating cucumber with mutton generates heat.

Excessive drinking and meat consumption, called "fat stupidity," leads to madness and recklessness.

Those who nourish themselves with good medicine and the five grains are called "middling scholars," yet they still suffer illnesses.

Those who consume *qi*, preserve essence, and cultivate spirit are called "superior scholars," attaining longevity equal to heaven.

**Miscellaneous Admonitions on Avoiding Harm and Seeking Goodness**

Prolonged gazing injures the blood, prolonged exposure injures the *qi*, prolonged standing injures the bones, prolonged walking injures the sinews, and prolonged sitting injures the flesh. Excessive longing or ambition harms a person, as do sorrow, grief, excessive joy, unresolved anger, relentless desires, and constant worries. Cold and heat imbalances harm a person, as does the failure to harmonize yin and yang.

All intercourse must follow the methods of *daoyin*. If one avoids these harmful practices and masters the arts of yin and yang, this is the Way of immortality.

Great joy makes the *qi* soar, while great sorrow blocks it.

Excessive ejaculation depletes a person’s strength, excessive gazing blinds the eyes, excessive sleep disturbs the heart, and overindulgence in rich food causes diarrhea.

Ordinary people only know to crave the five flavors, unaware that primordial *qi* can be consumed. Sages, knowing the five flavors cause illness, do not indulge in them, and understanding primordial *qi* can be ingested, remain silent to preserve essence, allowing *qi* to respond naturally.

If saliva is not swallowed, the sea of *qi* dries; if the sea dries, bodily fluids are depleted. Thus, consuming primordial *qi* and drinking from the sweet spring is the foundation of longevity.

Irregular bathing is inauspicious. Bathing together as husband and wife is inauspicious. After bathing, or when drunk or full, returning from a long journey, or exhausted, one must not engage in bedroom affairs—doing so causes illness; be vigilant.

Do not sleep with your head facing north, as it disturbs the six spirits, causing sorrow and forgetfulness.

Do not straddle wells—this has been a major taboo since ancient times.

If you see a low wall within ten paces, do not sit with your back to it, lest the wind blow and cause epilepsy or itching.

Do not stare at the sun or moon for long, as it impairs vision.

After sweating heavily, do not suddenly remove clothes, as carelessness often leads to partial wind and hemiplegia.

After bathing, do not expose your head to wind, or you may contract severe wind or piercing wind.

After exposure to cold, do not warm your face over a fire, as it causes emaciation and wind dizziness.

After sweating, do not sit with legs dangling for long, as it leads to blood impediment, heavy feet, and lumbar pain.

Do not enter water with sweaty feet, as it causes bone impediment or hidden spasms.

Holding urine for too long causes cold knees and cold impediment.

After eating hot food and sweating, do not expose yourself to wind, as it causes *zheng* disorders, headaches, dry eyes, and excessive sleepiness.

Before sleeping, do not sing or chant, as it is inauspicious.

Upon waking, do not speak loudly, as it harms the *qi*.

If a bird flies into you, do not eat it; if it has an open mouth or sores under its feathers, do not eat it either.

Washing your head with hot water and rinsing with cold causes head wind.

Do not place a fire stove beside your head while sleeping, as it makes the head heavy, the eyes red, and the nose dry.

Do not place a lamp beside your head after sleeping, as it disturbs the six spirits.

In winter, keep the feet warm and the head cool; in spring and autumn, keep both head and feet cool—this is the sage’s constant method.

Eating immediately after crying leads to *qi* disorders.

Do not cover your head while sleeping outdoors. Women must not sit with legs splayed—this is a major taboo.

Do not spit too far, as it causes lung disease, making the hands heavy, the back sore, and inducing coughing.

If someone is having a nightmare, do not shine a light on them, as it may cause death; calling them in the dark brings good fortune, but do not approach or wake them abruptly.

Do not sleep with your mouth open for long, as it leads to wasting-thirst and loss of complexion.

Upon waking, do not wash your face with cold water, as it causes dry eyes, blindness, and excessive tearing.

When traveling in the heat, do not wash your face upon encountering a river, as it causes dark moles.

After waking suddenly from sleep, do not drink water and lie down again, as it causes water impediment.

After sweating from an illness, do not drink cold water, as it harms the heart and abdomen, preventing recovery.

Do not see or smell a decaying corpse on an empty stomach, as the *qi* enters the nose and causes illness.

Before viewing a corpse, drink wine and chew garlic to ward off toxic *qi*.

For young children, do not let them point at the moon, lest sores form behind both ears that threaten to sever them—these are called "moon-eclipse sores." Pound toad into powder and apply it, and they will heal; moreover, no other sores will arise.

Pregnant women must not be near those with fox-like odor, as it causes swelling in the mother.

Do not urinate outdoors beneath the eaves, as it disturbs the six spirits and brings unease.

When sleeping, in spring and summer keep the head toward the east, in autumn and winter toward the west—this brings benefit.

When a man is hungry, he should urinate sitting; when full, standing—this keeps him free from illness.

When sleeping, curl the knees and lie on the side to strengthen one’s *qi* and vitality.

When lying down, turn frequently and speak softly with gentle laughter; speak as little as possible, and never raise the voice.

In spring, sleep early and rise early; in summer and autumn, retire late and rise early; in winter, sleep early and rise late—all bring benefit.

Though one should rise early, do not do so before the crow of the rooster; though one may rise late, do not do so after sunrise.

In winter, Heaven and Earth are closed, and yang *qi* is stored. Do not labor to the point of sweating, lest yang *qi* be dispersed and harm the person.

After washing the hair, do not tie it up in the wind, nor lie down with a wet head, as this causes head-wind, dizziness, stupor, hair loss, facial swelling, toothache, and deafness.

Do not wear damp or sweaty clothes for long, as this breeds sores and wind-itching ulcers.

Lord Lao said: On the first day of the first month, stand in the courtyard facing the *yin* direction, bow twice, and recite: "So-and-so year upon year receives the grace of the Great Dao. By the Mysterious Gate of the Grand Clarity, I pray to repay the debts of the past year." Men and women should each recite this three times. Practicing this Way regularly prolongs life.

The Mysterious Woman has a method for purifying the spirit; Huainan reveres the rites of divine favor—all seek to embody the true numinous and protect the true life. The esoteric essentials of the immortals’ scriptures teach that one should constantly visualize in the heart a *qi* as large as a goose egg, crimson within and yellow without, to ward off all evil and extend life.

To repel all evil and malevolent spirits, constantly visualize a raging fire as large as a bushel, blazing with brilliant light—then no evil will dare approach, and one may enter even plague-ridden places.

Before sleeping at night, always visualize red *qi* on the outside and white *qi* on the inside, covering the body to repel all evil spirits and demons.

Lord Lao said: Those who seek the Dao must not commit the five rebellions or six inauspicious acts; those who do will meet with misfortune.
Urinating or defecating toward the west is the first rebellion; toward the north, the second; toward the sun, the third; toward the moon, the fourth; and gazing upward at the sky or stars, the fifth.

Rising at night without protecting the body is the first inauspicious act; rising at dawn without guarding the will, the second; cursing or reviling the honored, the third; using the foot to stir fire, the fourth; coupling with a spouse in daylight, the fifth; and stealing from or harming one’s teacher, the sixth.

When rising in the morning, always speak of good things, and Heaven will grant you fortune. Do not sigh or sing idly, for this is called "inviting calamity."

Beware of singing outside the grove, for it invites misfortune; of prostrating outside the gate, for it invites lung afflictions; of discussing food and drink while lying down, for it invites illness; and of striking plates with chopsticks, for it invites misfortune.

The spirit that governs the hidden resides to the left of the mouth; if one harbors secret misfortune, this spirit reports it to Heaven, and Heaven then examines one’s soul and spirit.

The spirit that governs killing resides to the right of the mouth; if one speaks evil words, this spirit reports it to the Controller of Fate, who records it. When the sins are full, one is put to death.

These two spirits monitor the mouth—how can one not be cautious in speech when seeking nothing but fault in others?

The tongue is the soldier of the body, and good and evil arise from it—thus it is what Daoists most guard against.

Consuming jade spring prolongs life and eliminates the hundred diseases. Jade spring is the saliva in the mouth. At the crow of the rooster, dawn, noon, dusk, twilight, and midnight—seven times in a day and night—rinse the mouth with jade spring and swallow it. Each time, fill the mouth and swallow, and it will extend life.

Hair is the culmination of blood; teeth, the culmination of bone.

Nails are the culmination of sinews. Combing the hair a thousand times prevents it from turning white; tapping the teeth morning and evening prevents decay; trimming the nails frequently prevents the sinews from weakening.

One should often look in the mirror, which is called "preserving the form." Form and spirit preserve each other—this is its meaning. If one merely admires one’s appearance and cherishes vanity, it is better not to look at all.

On the following days— the first day of the first month, the second day of the second month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, the eleventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the twenty-first day of the ninth month, the fourteenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the thirtieth day of the twelfth month—one should gather wolfberry leaves, boil them into a decoction, and bathe in it. This will make the skin lustrous, prevent illness, and delay aging.

During a lunar eclipse, one should perform rescue rites to save lives and avert misfortune. Saving ten thousand lives is equal in merit to Heaven’s work. Heaven does not delight in killing; the sages emulate this. Those who do not delight in killing assist Heaven and Earth in nurturing life, thus attracting abundant fortune.

Good dreams may be spoken of; bad dreams should be kept silent—this nurtures one’s nature and prolongs life.

*Compiled by Tao Hongjing of Huayang*

**Chapter Four: Qi Ingestion for Healing Illness**

The *Yuanyang Jing* states: Regularly inhale qi through the nose, hold it in the mouth, swish it until full, then use the tongue to guide it past the lips and teeth before swallowing. Achieving a thousand swallows in a day and night is most excellent. One should eat sparingly, for excessive food causes qi to rebel, blocking the hundred vessels. When the vessels are blocked, qi cannot flow, and illness arises.

The *Xuanshi* states: Will is the commander of qi; qi is the filling of the body. Those who act with virtue preserve their life; those who act with vice lose their form. Thus, the method of circulating qi requires moderation in diet, movement of the body, and harmonization of qi and blood. Proceed lightly and cease before overdoing; do not lose control. If qi surges abruptly, restore it gently. The posture resembles swallowing: hold the body upright, focus the mind, and firmly guard the inner and outer. Close the upper and lower passages, allowing spirit to permeate the limbs and bones, regulating and smoothing them. With disciplined cultivation, the *guanyuan* fills and the feet grow firm, and all pathogenic influences depart naturally.

Peng Zu said: Regularly hold the breath and inhale, from dawn until noon. Then kneel and sit, wipe the eyes, massage the body, lick the lips, swallow saliva, and ingest qi dozens of times before rising to walk, speak, or laugh. If fatigue or discomfort arises, perform *daoyin* and hold the breath to attack the affliction. One must visualize the body—head, face, nine orifices, five viscera, four limbs, even the tips of the hair—directing qi to each part. When the qi feels like clouds moving through the body, rising from the nose and mouth and reaching the fingertips, the true spirit becomes clear and harmonious. No needles, medicines, moxibustion, or acupuncture are needed.

To cure all illnesses through qi circulation, focus the mind on the affected area. For headaches, direct the mind to the head; for foot pain, direct it to the feet. Harmonize the qi to attack the ailment, and it will dissipate over time. If struck by cold from seasonal qi, hold the breath to induce sweating; when sweat covers the body, the illness will resolve.

Though holding and circulating qi is essential for healing, one must first understand its principles and practice on an empty stomach, not when full. If qi becomes stagnant and fails to flow freely, it may cause sores—like a spring that must not be dammed. Consuming raw fish, raw vegetables, fatty meats, or failing to dispel anger, sorrow, and worry before circulating qi may cause counterflow of qi.

Those learning qi circulation should proceed gradually.

Liu Jun’an said: Ingesting the living and expelling the dead ensures longevity—this means inhaling through the nose is "living" and exhaling through the mouth is "dead." Those who cannot ingest qi should practice from morning to night without ceasing, slowly and gently inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth—this is called "expelling the old and taking in the new."

The *Qi Ingestion Classic* states: The Dao is qi. Preserving qi is attaining the Dao; attaining the Dao is enduring existence. Spirit is essence. Preserving essence brings spiritual clarity; spiritual clarity brings longevity. Essence is the flowing river of blood and vessels, the numinous spirit guarding the bones. When essence departs, the bones wither, and death follows. Thus, in cultivating the Dao, one must treasure essence.

From midnight to noon is the time of living qi; from noon to midnight is the time of dead qi. During the living qi period, lie flat on your back, close your eyes, and clench your fists as an infant does—pressing the thumb with the four fingers. Hold the breath without exhaling, counting to two hundred in the mind before releasing the breath through the mouth. Increase the count daily. In this way, body and spirit unite, the five viscera are at peace, and one can hold the breath to two hundred fifty. The "flower canopy" (the brows) brightens, ears and eyes grow sharp, the whole body remains free of illness, and no evil can assail one.

In circulating qi, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, drawing it gently—this is called "long breathing." There is one way to inhale and six ways to exhale. Inhalation is simply drawing in breath. The six exhalations are *chui* (blowing), *hu* (breathing), *xi* (sighing), *he* (exhaling), *xu* (hissing), and *si* (swallowing)—all methods of expelling qi.

Human breathing naturally follows this pattern. For long-breathing exhalation techniques, use *chui* in cold times and *hu* in warm times. To treat illnesses precisely: *chui* dispels wind, *hu* dispels heat, *xi* dispels vexation, *he* descends qi, *xu* disperses stagnation, and *si* relieves exhaustion. When people are exhausted, they often sigh (*xu* and *si*). Daoists practicing qi circulation generally avoid *xu* and *si*, for these are signs of long-breathing fatigue. This method is preserved for both men and women, originating from the *Immortal Classic*.

Before circulating qi, remove the hairs from the nose—this is the path to communion with the spirit. Do not draw qi during heavy dew, harsh winds, extreme cold, or intense heat.

The *Mingyi Lun* states: The origin of illness lies in the five labors. Once the five labors are exerted, the two viscera are first damaged—heart and kidneys receive evil, and all organs and bowels fall ill.

The five labors are:
1. Will labor,
2. Thought labor,
3. Heart labor,
4. Worry labor,
5. Fatigue labor.

The five labors give rise to the six extremes:
1. Qi extreme,
2. Blood extreme,
3. Sinew extreme,
4. Bone extreme,
5. Essence extreme,
6. Marrow extreme.

The six extremes become the seven injuries, which transform into the seven pains. The seven pains cause illness, leading to an excess of pathogenic qi and a deficiency of upright qi. One becomes absent-minded, forgetful, sorrowful, and joyless. Food no longer nourishes, the skin loses its luster, and the hair turns white and withers. In severe cases, one may suffer from great wind, hemiplegia, sinew contraction, limb spasms, joint blockages, emaciation, shortness of breath, and pain in the waist and legs—all caused by early marriage, excessive expenditure of essence, insufficient blood and qi, and extreme exhaustion.

Illness arises from the five viscera; one must identify its root. Those who do not understand should not attempt treatment.

For heart-viscera illness, where the body experiences cold and heat, use the *hu* and *chui* exhalations to expel it.

For lung-viscera illness, where the chest and back feel distended and full, use the *xu* exhalation to expel it. For spleen-viscera illness, where the body experiences wandering wind, persistent itching, and pain, use the *xi* exhalation to expel it. For liver-viscera illness, where the eyes ache and one feels sorrowful and joyless, use the *he* exhalation to expel it.

The twelve methods of regulating qi above all require drawing qi in through the nose and expelling it through the mouth, ensuring the sound of the breath follows the specific exhalations: *chui*, *hu*, *xu*, *he*, *xi*, and *yan*. If the afflicted practice these methods with reverence and focus, there will be no illness that is not cured—this is the essential art of longevity.

**Chapter Five: Daoist Exercises and Massage**

The *Daoist Exercises Classic* states: At dawn before rising, first click the teeth thirty-four times, close the eyes, clench the fists, swish the mouth full of saliva, and swallow it three times. Then hold the breath to the utmost limit, and only after reaching the limit exhale slowly. Repeat this three times. Next, rise and assume the posture of a crouching wolf or a craning crow, shaking the body left and right without holding the breath, again to the utmost limit, three times. Then rise and descend to the grove, clench the fists without holding the breath, stamp the heels three times, raise one hand while lowering the other, again without holding the breath, to the utmost limit three times. Next, clasp the hands behind the neck and twist the body left and right, without holding the breath, three more times. Then stretch both legs and clasp the hands, leaning forward and backward, to the utmost limit three times. All these should be practiced morning and evening; frequent practice is especially beneficial.

At dawn, rub the palms together until hot and press them over the eyes three times. Then, with the fingers, scratch the four corners of the eyes to brighten the vision. According to the classic, securing the Gate of the Hun and controlling the Door of the Po is called "clenching the fists," which stabilizes the hun and po and secures their gates. This is the method to preserve essence, brighten the eyes, prolong life, and restore black hair. If one clenches the fists all day, noxious qi and all poisons cannot enter.

**Method of Clenching the Fists:** Bend the thumb beneath the four fingers and grasp it. With persistent practice, the eyes will no longer involuntarily open. Some say this prevents demonic possession.

The *Inner Explanation* states: The six that harm the body are: first, essence; second, saliva; third, tears; fourth, mucus; fifth, sweat; and sixth, urine. Their harm varies in degree. If one can go all day without spitting or sniffling, one should swish the mouth when full and swallow the saliva. If one constantly holds a jujube pit in the mouth and swallows the saliva, it generates a lovable qi and produces body fluids—this is of great importance. (Note: It is the fluids that are swallowed, not the pit.) Each morning, click the teeth thirty-six times—up to three hundred is even better—to strengthen the teeth and prevent pain. Then, stir the tongue to swish the mouth’s fluids, filling the mouth and swallowing three times. Next, rub the Shaoyang meridian of the fingers until hot and press them over the eyes, completing fourteen cycles to brighten the vision.

Every morning upon rising, clasp the hands over the ears and vigorously rub them up and down fourteen times to prevent deafness. Then, click the teeth, swish the Jade Spring three times and swallow, contract the nose, hold the breath, and with the right hand pull the left ear from above the head fourteen times. Repeat with the left hand pulling the right ear fourteen times to prolong life and prevent deafness. Next, pull the temples’ hair upward fourteen times, then grasp all the hair with both hands, pulling upward with full force fourteen times to promote the circulation of blood and qi and prevent the hair from turning white.

Another method: Rub the hands until hot and massage the face from top to bottom to dispel noxious qi and give the face a radiant glow. Another method: Rub the hands until hot and vigorously massage the body from top to bottom—this is called "dry bathing," which enables one to withstand wind and cold, seasonal heat, headaches, and all illnesses. Before retiring at night, always rub the body with both hands—this is also called "dry bathing" and wards off wind and evil qi.

Sit upright, support the head with the left hand, and with the right hand reach upward as far as possible, then shake the body and hand together three times. Repeat with the right hand supporting the head and the left hand reaching upward to relieve sleep-induced lethargy.

Before sunrise in the morning, face south and sit upright. With both hands supporting the thighs, shake vigorously three times to give the face a radiant glow. Before washing and combing in the morning, sit upright, grasp the right hand with the left on the left thigh, and push forward and pull back with full force three times. Repeat with the right hand grasping the left on the right thigh. Next, clasp the hands and push forward with full force three times, then clasp the hands before the chest, push the elbows forward with full force three times. Straighten the left arm and bend the right arm as if drawing a bow of one *hu* and five *dou* capacity, exerting full strength. Repeat the bow-drawing posture with the right hand. Next, with the right hand on the ground and the left hand reaching upward as if supporting the sky, exert full force; repeat with the left hand on the ground. Then, clench the fists and thrust forward, each side twenty-one times. Next, clench the left hand and reach behind the back to grasp the fingers three times with full force; repeat with the right hand. This treats fatigue and qi stagnation in the back, arms, and elbows—frequent practice is especially beneficial.

At dawn after turning over, use a long staff to support the armpit, let the left foot hang in front of the grove, and slowly rise to full height, pulling the left foot fifty-seven times. Repeat with the right foot. This treats leg qi, pain and oppression, cold qi between the waist and kidneys, cold impediment, and cold knees and feet—all are addressed by this. Practicing this three times at dawn and dusk is even better. Avoid doing this when overly full or suppressing the urge to urinate.

If no staff is available for the pulling exercise, simply ensure the foot being pulled does not touch the ground—supporting oneself with a hand on an object will suffice.

Morning and evening, comb the hair a full thousand strokes to greatly dispel head wind and prevent the hair from turning white. After combing, rub the crown of the head with salt blossoms and raw sesame oil for even better results. If *Divine Brightness Ointment* is available, rubbing it in is excellent.

When washing and combing in the morning, knock the teeth one hundred and sixty times, and whenever saliva arises, swallow it. Then rinse the mouth with water, and further clean the teeth with tooth powder. Next, take a small half-measure of slightly fermented, clear rice-wash, swish it thoroughly, and spit it out to wash the eyes with the rinsing water. Afterward, close the eyes and wash the face with cold water—be sure no cold water enters the eyes. This method strengthens the teeth, brightens the eyes without tearing, and permanently prevents tooth decay.

When washing the face at dawn and rinsing the mouth, swallow one or two mouthfuls of cold water to clarify the mind, dispel heat from the chest, and resolve oppression.

Hua Tuo of Qiao County was skilled in nurturing life. His disciples Wu Pu of Guangling and Fan A of Pengcheng received his teachings. Hua Tuo told Wu Pu: "The human body requires movement, but one must not overexert. Constant motion digests the grain qi, circulates the blood and vessels, and prevents illness—like a door hinge that does not rot. The immortals of old and the Daoist Junqian of the Han dynasty practiced *daoyin* for health, performing bear hangs and crane stretches, pulling and extending the waist and limbs, and moving all the joints to seek longevity."

"I have a technique called the *Five Animals Play*: first the tiger, second the deer, third the bear, fourth the ape, and fifth the crow. These exercises eliminate illness, benefit the limbs, and serve as regular *daoyin*. When the body feels unwell, perform one of the animal plays until a slight sweat appears, then stop. Dust the body lightly with powder, and one will feel light and at ease, with the stomach ready for food."

Wu Pu practiced this and lived to over ninety, with keen hearing and vision, strong and complete teeth, and an appetite like that of a youth.

**Tiger Play**: Crouch on all fours, spring forward three times, then backward twice. Extend the waist, stretch the legs to the side, look up to the sky, then return to the crouch and move forward and backward, seven times each.

**Deer Play**: Crouch on all fours, stretch the neck and look back, left three times and right twice. Extend and retract the left and right legs, three and two times respectively.

**Bear Play**: Lie flat on the back, clasp the knees with both hands, lift the head, and roll to the left to touch the ground seven times, then to the right seven times. Squat and push the ground with the hands to the left and right.

**Ape Play**: Grasp an object and hang, stretching and contracting the body up and down seven times. Hook an object with the feet and hang, left and right seven times each. Stand on the hands, pull the body back, and press the head down, seven times each.

**Crow Play**: Stand on both hands, lift one foot, stretch both arms, raise the eyebrows, and exert force fourteen times each. Sit and extend the legs, pull the toes seven times each, and retract and extend the arms fourteen times each.

The *Five Animals Play* should be performed according to one’s strength, stopping when sweat appears. After sweating, dust the body lightly with powder to digest grain qi, boost vitality, and eliminate all illnesses. Those who persist in this practice will surely attain longevity.

There is another method: sit calmly before eating and self-massage. Interlace the fingers, stretch the arms and thighs, and guide the flow of all vessels—this is more effective than medicine. Sit upright, look up to the sky, and exhale to instantly dissolve the qi of food and drink or drunkenness. Practicing this in summer keeps one cool and prevents heat.

**Chapter Six: On the Benefits and Harms of Sexual Union**

The Dao treasures essence: when expended, it gives life to others; when retained, it sustains the self. Sustaining the self leads to seeking transcendence and immortality; giving life to others fulfills one’s duty and then retreats. Yet fulfilling duty and retreating may entangle one in desire, becoming a grave peril. Why recklessly expend and waste it, unaware of the mounting loss, until exhaustion and life’s decline?

Heaven and Earth possess yin and yang, which humans value. Valuing them in accord with the Dao requires only caution against waste.

Pengzu said: "The superior person sleeps apart; the middling person uses separate covers. Consuming a thousand doses of medicine is not as good as sleeping alone." Sensual indulgence blinds the eyes, noise deafens the ears, and rich flavors dull the palate. If one can regulate and express the Dao, appropriately adjusting its flow and blockage, one may increase longevity.

**Daily Taboo**: Do not eat to fullness at dusk. Sleeping after a full nighttime meal shortens a day’s lifespan.

**Monthly Taboo**: Do not drink to intoxication at dusk. Sleeping after nighttime drunkenness shortens a month’s lifespan.

**Yearly Taboo**: Avoid sexual union at dusk. Each union shortens a year’s lifespan, and recovery is impossible.

**Lifelong Taboo**: Protect qi at dusk. Sleeping with the mouth open at night loses qi and allows evil to enter through the mouth.

The *Cai Nü* asked Pengzu: "Should a person at sixty guard essence and maintain unity?"

Pengzu replied: "No. A man should not be without a woman. Without a woman, his thoughts stir, thoughts stir and the spirit labors, and spirit labor shortens lifespan. If one’s thoughts are truly upright, it is best to have no desires—yet this is nearly impossible. Forcibly suppressing and restraining them is difficult to maintain and easy to lose, causing seminal leakage, turbid urine, and even ghostly unions. Moreover, if qi is not aroused, the yang path weakens.

When wishing to unite with a woman, first stir and arouse to strengthen the yang. Then proceed slowly, allowing her to receive yin qi. The yin qi will push the yang, and soon it will strengthen naturally. Use it when strong, but proceed slowly and sparsely. When essence stirs, regulate it; close the essence, slow the breath, close the eyes, lie still, and guide the body’s qi. Then one may unite with another woman. Each arousal should involve a different partner—changing partners can lead to longevity. If one unites with the same woman, her yin qi will be weak, and the benefit will be slight.

The yang path is like fire; the yin path is like water. Water can control fire..."

When yin also consumes yang, and its use is unceasing, yin qi hums against yang, causing yang to turn to harm. What is gained does not compensate for what is lost.

Yet if one can unite with twelve women without emission, it will grant an aged man a youthful countenance. If one unites with ninety-three women without emission, one may live ten thousand years.

When essence is scant, illness follows; when essence is exhausted, death ensues. One must restrain and be cautious.

Frequent union with occasional emission allows essence and qi to grow anew, preventing depletion. But if one emits with each union, essence cannot accumulate, and the path of essence will be exhausted.

Those who frequently unite at home do so because each union without emission preserves the essence of a single emission. If emission occurs, frequent union becomes impossible. Even if one emits only twice a month, essence and qi will naturally regenerate, though slowly and subtly, unable to rise swiftly—far inferior to frequent union without emission.

The "Gathering Maiden" was a young adept who understood nurturing life. At one hundred seventy years, she appeared as a girl of fifteen. The King of Yin served her and sought the Way from Peng Zu.

Peng Zu said: The reason debauchery shortens life is not the work of ghosts or spirits, but rather vulgar intent, stirred essence, and reckless emission to satisfy another’s desire. Exhausting oneself without restraint harms rather than nourishes, leading to madness, wasting thirst, epilepsy, or malignant sores—all from loss of essence. After each emission, one should practice guiding and drawing to replenish the loss. Without this, blood, vessels, marrow, and brain daily diminish. Wind and dampness invade, giving rise to illness, for common people know not the proper balance of replenishment and release.

Peng Zu said: No man should be without a woman, nor woman without a man. Those who live alone and long for union harm their longevity, invite a hundred illnesses, and may even be joined by ghostly spirits. Losing essence once in such cases is as damaging as a hundred losses.

If seeking a child—one long-lived, wise, prosperous, and noble—emitting essence on a lunar-mansion day is most auspicious. The lunar-mansion days are recorded below.

Tian Lao said: All humans bear the Five Constants and share the same form, yet differ in rank and fortune. This arises from the union of parents under the eight stars of yin and yang, when yin and yang fail to align with the proper time.

If the union does not occur on a lunar-mansion day but falls at the right time, the child will be of superior quality. If neither condition is met, the child will be an ordinary person. Union on a lunar-mansion day—even if not at the proper time—may still produce a noble child and benefit the parents, a most auspicious sign.

The eight stars are: Chamber, Net, Well, Ghost, Willow, Spread, Heart, and Dipper. When the moon lodges in these stars, one may unite in yin and yang to seek a child.

The second, third, fifth, ninth, and twentieth days of the lunar month are days of flourishing life-energy. Union on these days multiplies vitality fivefold, sparing blood and qi and preventing illness. On these flourishing days, after midnight and before the cock’s crow, one should gently caress the Jade Spring, sip the Jade Nectar, and playfully engage.

If these days coincide with the seasonal stems—spring’s *jia-yin* and *yi-mao*, summer’s *bing-wu* and *ding-wei*, autumn’s *geng-shen* and *xin-you*, winter’s *ren-zi* and *gui-hai*—the benefits are even greater.

To conceive a son, wait until one, three, or five days after the woman’s menstrual flow ceases, then choose a flourishing day. At the hour when qi is born, after midnight, emit essence. The child will be male, long-lived, wise, and noble.

The flourishing days are: spring’s *jia* and *yi*, summer’s *bing* and *ding*, autumn’s *geng* and *xin*, winter’s *ren* and *gui*.

In nurturing life, the essential principle lies in treasuring essence. If one emits twice a month, aligning with the twenty-four solar terms in a year, one may live to one hundred twenty. With the addition of medicinal supplements, one may attain longevity.

The trouble is that in youth, people do not know the Way; even if they know, they do not trust or practice it. Only in old age do they begin to understand, but by then it is too late, and illness is hard to cure. Yet even late in life, if one can preserve oneself, one may still extend years and add to life. If one practices the Way in youth and prime, immortality may be hoped for.

The *Scripture of Immortals* says: The Dao of dual cultivation for man and woman lies in deep insertion without moving essence. Visualize a red hue within the navel, as large as a parrot’s egg, then slowly withdraw. When essence stirs, retreat. Practicing this dozens of times in a day and night will enhance longevity. Man and woman should each still their minds and focus together, requiring intense concentration.

Daoist Liu Jing said: In spring, emit essence once every three days; in summer and autumn, twice a month; in winter, constantly retain essence without emission. Heaven’s Dao conceals yang in winter; those who emulate this attain longevity. One emission in winter equals a hundred in spring.

Master Ji Dao said: At sixty, one should entirely abstain from the bedchamber. If one can unite without emitting essence, one may still engage with women. If one cannot, complete avoidance is best. No hundred medicines compare to this practice in securing long life.

The *Daoist Grove* states: The root of life is the foundation of existence. Next in importance is this Way. Though one may take potent medicines, practice breath control and guiding, and cultivate myriad methods, without knowing the root of life, it is like a tree with lush branches and leaves but no roots—it cannot live long. The root of life lies in the affairs of the bedchamber.

Thus the sage said: To attain longevity, one must follow the source of life. The affairs of the bedchamber can give life or take it. Like water and fire, those who know their use may nurture life; those who do not may die instantly.

Union is especially forbidden when drunk or sated—this is a great taboo, harming a hundredfold. If one unites while suppressing the urge to urinate, it may cause strangury, difficult urination, pain in the stem, or stiffness in the lower abdomen.

After great anger and intercourse, one may develop carbuncles and deep abscesses.

*The Daoist Mechanism* states: Taboos in the bedchamber include the dark and new moons, the first and last quarters, full moons, solar and lunar eclipses, fierce winds, violent rain, earthquakes, thunder, lightning, and extreme cold or heat. On the days when the seasons change in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and during the five days of transition between them, one must not engage in yin-yang union. The prohibitions are especially strict on one’s birth year, month, and day. When yin and yang are in conflict, union must not occur—it harms the blood and qi, drains the upright and admits the perverse, greatly injuring the true qi. Beware of this.

One must not engage in the bedchamber after newly washing the hair, after exhaustion from travel, or in states of great joy or anger.

Pengzu said: The subtleties of regulation must be understood. One must also avoid great cold, great heat, fierce winds, heavy rain, deep snow, solar and lunar eclipses, earthquakes, and thunderclaps—these are the heavenly taboos. Drunkenness, satiety, joy, anger, sorrow, grief, fear, and dread—these are the human taboos. Sacred mountains and rivers, altars of soil and grain, and places near wells and stoves—these are the earthly taboos. Having avoided these three taboos, there are also auspicious days: in spring, *jia* and *yi* days; in summer, *bing* and *ding* days; in autumn, *geng* and *xin* days; in winter, *ren* and *gui* days; and in the last month of each season, *wu* and *ji* days. These are the days of flourishing vitality. Union on such days brings long life, and any children conceived will surely be long-lived. Violating these taboos leads to illness, and children born will be ill-fated and short-lived.

Laozi said: Returning the essence to replenish the brain can achieve agelessness.

*The Scripture of Zidu* states: In the method of emission, one must enter weakly and withdraw strongly. What does this mean? Insert the jade stem between the zither strings and wheat sprouts, then withdraw when it is swollen and large—this is weak entry and strong withdrawal. Regulate this until eighty movements are completed, and the yang number is fulfilled, which is the sublime method.

Laozi said: Weak entry and strong withdrawal is the art of nurturing life. Strong entry and weak withdrawal will abruptly end a good life—this is what it means.
