**The Esoteric Canon of the Six Yin Caverns of the Mysterious Transformations of the Hidden Dao: The Authentic Classic of Dunjia, Scroll One**

The Most High said:
Those who seek transmission must first bathe and purify the body, solemnly light incense before the stove, gaze upon the Northern Asterism, and with reverent heart offer prayers to the fragrant smoke. They shall invoke the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Most High Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens, and the Sacred Master, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, saying:

*"I, a disciple of the Most High, having received the* **Scripture of the Six Yin Caverns of the Mysterious Jade Maiden of the Most High***, have taken refuge in its precepts and wear its teachings close to my person, practicing in accordance with its methods. I humbly pray that Heaven may bestow blessings and protection, that Earth may grant auspicious omens, that the Great Dao may swiftly be accomplished, and that my heart’s vows may soon be fulfilled.*

*After receiving this canon, I shall forever uphold its practice, never speaking lightly or deceitfully, never recklessly disclosing it to unworthy persons, never employing it for perverse ends, nor seeking杂慕. From the moment I obtain this method, I vow to seek longevity, to benefit the common people, to aid the nation and succor the people, to retreat into solitude and purity, and to dispel demons and slay evil. May the Three Heavens deign to witness this, and may all phenomena come to know it. Grant me communion with the numinous, that my aspirations may be realized. Should I ever act recklessly or practice sorcery, I willingly submit to Heaven’s punishment, and the Sacred Perfected shall withhold their protection."*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances, let it be done.*

After transmission, on an auspicious day, prepare seven oil-and-flour cakes, seven *huanxi* sweet dumplings, seven strips of pure cloth, and seven cups of jujube broth. At the second watch, when the stars and moon shine brightly, arrange seven offerings beneath the Northern Dipper, burning abundant incense in a blazing fire. Holding this canon, bow one hundred times and proclaim:

*"I pour forth my heart and devote my will, gathering qi and uniting with the spirit. I bow twice and offer incense, pledging my sincerity in this oath. I am a child of the Most High, having long practiced purity and stillness, earnestly discerning the heart of Heaven. I wish to depart the mundane world and return to Penglai. With utmost reverence, I make this supplication, humbly beseeching the True Compassion to look down with mercy and witness my vow.*

*On this day of such-and-such month and year, I have received the* **Scripture of the Six Yin Caverns of the Mysterious Jade Maiden of the Most High***. I now wish to practice its teachings and pray for the witness of this covenant. Having received this method, I dare not treat it lightly. Unless in dire need to save others, I swear never to misuse it."*

I now reverently face Your august presence and solemnly pledge these words. Should I fail to uphold them, I willingly accept punishment. In all matters of urgency or delay, I pray for Your protection and aid. I advance to offer incense and bow twice, then softly invoke:

*"I beseech the two or three Jade Maidens to serve as my envoys—ascending to the celestial court, descending to traverse the world, dispatching flying talismans and swift seals, expelling evil and slaying demons, fulfilling all tasks I command. Humbly I implore Your august compassion to look down with favor and witness my plea."*

Again I offer incense and bow twice, then invoke:

*"The matters I have declared are now laid before Your presence. Humbly I pray for Your mighty power to grant constant protection and blessing."*

After bowing, I withdraw the incense altar. On a chosen auspicious day, I prepare a portion of tea, a cup of wine, and a plate of fruit. At the second watch, unseen by others, I face the Northern Asterism beneath the eaves, set up the incense altar, offer incense, and bow twice, then reverently invoke:

*"True Martial Spirit of the North, Perfected Sovereign of Numinous Response, this night and hour, I beseech You to descend in majesty. I have a humble matter to present before Your presence with a hundred bows. I uphold the mandate of the Most High, practicing the registers of the Dao. I slay ghosts and dispel evil, aid the state and pacify households, seek immortality and study the Dao, succoring the orphaned and impoverished. I wish to practice the* **Scripture of the Six Yin Caverns of the Mysterious Jade Maiden**, *commanding two or three Jade Maidens to harmonize Heaven and Earth and subdue demonic forces. By principle and reason, I seek to fulfill this vow. Humbly I pray that the August Sovereign witness my sincerity and lend Your mighty power. Daring to rely on the exalted Perfected, may I forever abide in the true position. Where my seal is placed, let it be the Daoist sanctuary. Humbly I beseech Your sagely compassion to extend Your sacred virtue."*

Then I form the mudra with both thumbs and invoke:

*"Heaven is serene, Earth is tranquil; yin is turbid, yang is clear.
Eyes blazing, hair unbound, the Tortoise and Serpent unite in form.
Wielding the sacred sword, I sever demonic essences.
Come and dwell in my chamber, presiding over the Six Yin’s majesty.
Hear my invocation, follow my decree.
Eternally guard the central position, protecting until immortality is achieved."*

*Swift as the statutes command!* (Recited seven times.)

Again I offer incense and invoke:

*"I wish the two or three Jade Maidens to serve as my envoys for all exorcistic tasks. May the August Sovereign grant protection, aiding the divine hemp, for which I am deeply fortunate."*

I bow twice, then withdraw the altar and take my leave.

**Grand Ritual of Offering**
On a *guihai* day, first write the petition and talismans to summon the deities. Keep outsiders beyond the precincts. The night before, prepare offerings and offer incense. Face north before the altar, visualize the deities, and knock the teeth together before invoking:

*"I, a disciple of the register of [such-and-such] prefecture, most reverently bow and invoke:
Ancestral Master, True Martial of the North, Perfected Sovereign Who Upholds Sageliness, may Your sagely presence descend to witness the great covenant of the ritual."*

I offer incense and pour wine, then invoke before the Perfected Sovereign of *Dingmao*:

*"I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dingmao*, ‘Foot Day,’ named* Baozhong*, the Perfected Sovereign of Boundless Benevolence and Blessing, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense."*

I burn incense, burn the *Hetong* talisman, recite my personal incantation, and draw the qi of the proper direction to blow upon it. Next, I invoke:

*"I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dingchou*,* Hei Wushang*, named* Taihe*, the Perfected Sovereign of Horizontal Heaven and Benevolent Actuality, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense.
I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dinghai*,* Lu Mingji*, named* Guangyang*, the Perfected Sovereign of the Capital Prefecture and Benevolent Origin, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense.
I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dingyou*,* Jiu Qinling*, named* Zhengyi Yafu Renxiu*, the Perfected Sovereign of Rectitude and Rest, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense.
I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dingwei*,* Cheng Suling*, named* Xuanying Wubi Renzhi*, the Peerless Perfected Sovereign of Mysterious Radiance, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense.
I humbly summon the Jade Maiden of* Dingsi*,* Zhu Fucheng*, named* Wenguang Gaoshang Rende*, the Exalted Perfected Sovereign of Cultivated Virtue, to descend to this altar upon smelling my incense."*

*"Now that I have reverently summoned the two or three Jade Maidens, may they deign to descend in majesty. Humbly I beseech Your true numina to condescend to this great transformation, descending in ritual splendor to receive my earnest prayers."*

With the left middle finger and the right *Dasha* mudra, I knock my teeth thirty-six times and recite the *Hidden Words of the Six Yin and Six Ding Jade Maidens and Eight Pure Ones*:

*"Nine qi of the radiant dragon follow the Five Peaks.
The Four Saints of Heavenly Obscurity and the Ten Origins of the Eight Poles.
The hundred spirits of the Dipper and the twelve daily asterisms.
The Six Ding Jade Maidens, may You bestow true radiance to aid the ritual’s commands and restraints.
I invoke the* **Most High Lord Lao** *to thoroughly enforce the statutes and save!"*

(Recited three times in succession.)

I summon each of the Six Ding Jade Maidens by their names and mudras. Then I perform the *Dang* step:

*"Concealing form, hiding traces, I tread my* Dang *and* Kui*.*
*I see them, yet they know not me.
Moving and planting as I will, demons follow at my rebuke.
Swift as water and fire, dancing like wind and thunder.
Transforming marshes into mountains, overturning earth and sky.
My body is firm, tranquil and silent.
For ten thousand ages, I attain long life and merge with the Dao to become immortal."*

*Swift as the statutes of the Dark Maiden of the Nine Heavens command!*

I draw the qi of each direction and blow it into the altar. I invite the Jade Maidens to take their seats according to their positions, burn six talismans of their respective forms in the altar, knock my teeth, close my eyes, and visualize the six Jade Maidens descending to the altar. I bow twice and offer incense, then invoke:

*"After reverently summoning the True Martial Sovereign, I now burn incense to invite the two or three Jade Maidens. Having visualized their descent and seating, I, disciple [Name], bow twice in reverence.
I am a disciple of the* **Most High Lord Lao**, *having long upheld the sagely Dao, desiring eternal life.
I tread the pure and contend with the rules, practicing profound and wondrous deeds.
Ever devoted to the supreme Dao, I receive the mandate to cultivate.
Above, I offer prayers for the souls of my ancestors; below, I relieve the calamities and epidemics of the myriad people.
I uphold the registers of the Dao and practice its restraints.
Now I wish to establish an altar, adorn a purified chamber, and prepare offerings according to the ritual statutes to feast the Perfected Sovereign.
Relying on Your majestic radiance, I humbly beseech Your thorough witness.
I seek to master the principles of immortality, pacify the state and people, enchant water and dispatch talismans to expel evil and govern ghosts.
Above, to aid the state’s needs; below, to support my own destiny."*

For all matters great or small, every act of movement relies on the majestic immortals to serve as messengers. Assist me in my practice and heed my instructions. From east to west, south to north, all shall comply and obey. Call their names and inscribe their seals—upon hearing the invocation, they shall arrive at once. Record their words and never break faith.

Light incense and bow twice, then draw near softly and whisper:
"I bear the command of the Most High and the decree of the Jade Emperor to harmonize the cosmos, pacify and aid the state, raise armies and act, dispatch ghosts and expel evil. Today, I feast the immortal spirits, that they may forever serve as my protective envoys. You must adapt to my strategies and follow my actions. Should any disobey, they shall face the command of the Most High and the decree of the Jade Emperor—severing the spirit’s body and extinguishing the spirit’s virtue."

May the numinous ones, in their wisdom, deign to listen below.
Bow twice more, light incense, and raise the wine.

Next, kneel and prostrate, knocking teeth together, and pray:
"Disciple [Name] humbly encounters this grand assembly’s night and reverently offers sacrifice before the two or three Jade Maidens. I reflect that my nature is innate, my heart bears heaven’s decree, and my original master holds a covenant, a transmission from the Most High. Now, on this grand occasion, I modestly present this cup.

The Wind Earl sweeps clean, the Rain Master purifies the altar. I, your devotee, cherish auspicious omens. Having declared my name and lineage, I wish to receive your true radiance, serve you all my life, and never forget you. Today’s offering includes fine meats, dried delicacies, and fragrant incense—jujubes from Anyi, with small pits and tender flesh; pure, clear wine, its floating froth poured in streams; seasonal fruits; and white rice, the finest grain. Partake of my feast, drink and eat your fill. When sated with wine and food, follow my every move. Whatever I pray for, respond in kind. Ever attend me, ever guard my side. May my wishes prosper and flourish. Wherever I go, may the Perfected accompany me. In concealment or openness, in all journeys, may all be peaceful. Swiftly achieve the great Dao and soon reach the immortal realm. When I suffer, may the Perfected bring auspicious tidings. When I desire, may the Perfected follow and fulfill. Entering enemy lands to protect the state, may all be well. Safeguard my body, and with heaven and earth, endure.

Pour the libation, offer the drunkenness—may it be received with favor.
Hastily, as by the statutes and decrees of the Most High."

Bow twice more and light incense, then recite the personal incantation of your own body. Draw in a breath of qi and blow it upon the seat, secretly saying:
"Jade Maiden of Dingmao, you possess the *Six Yin Classic* and the *True Writ of the Subtle Cavern* of the Most High. You know the names of spirits and the titles of immortals. With the proper method, you summon immortals; with the proper method, you command spirits. Traversing the Three Realms, emerging from darkness into light, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, all rely on the immortal Perfected. Summoned, you arrive at once; invoked, you descend immediately. All affairs of the human world, let me hear them clearly. I vow to repay your favor—do not defy me.
Hastily, as by the statutes and decrees."

Recite three times. Draw qi from the Dingmao direction and blow it forth. Then do the same from Dingchou, and likewise for the other directions.

Light incense devoutly and recite the incantation:
"Command the Six Yin, emerge from darkness into light. Fearless and unafraid, unshaken by anything. Follow the turning of my talismans, follow the movement of my seals. Dispel ten thousand calamities, gather blessings upon myself. Active by day, concealed by night—do not disobey my command.
Hastily, as by the statutes and decrees."

After completing this cycle six times, align all to their proper positions. Light incense and bow twice, then take a talisman, roll it into a ball, and consume it with the wine from each position. Bow in gratitude, completing this for all six positions in their proper alignment.

Light incense and recite:
"Now I uphold the method, I am the master, and the Perfected are my disciples. What I dispatch, the spirits shall follow. From this moment onward, never leave my side. Golden coins and cloud steeds shall aid the Perfected’s journey. In all undertakings, do not break faith."

Burn the paper money, then close the altar.

**Memorial Submitting the Classics by Minister Zhao Pu, Right Vice Director of the Chancellery of the Song Dynasty**

Your servant has heard that if heaven’s measure is vast, its covering of all things must be broad; if a person possesses extraordinary talent, establishing merit is not difficult. When the time is ripe with heaven’s favor, it must coincide with a gathering of wind and cloud. Your servant first followed Your Majesty in reclaiming the various states, and though I never matched Xiao He of Han in securing maps and documents for the secret archives, my aspirations were no different.

Moreover, the books stored in the various secret halls may indeed be called arcane. Such works as the *Tai Bai Yin Jing*, *Thirty-Six Ministries of Thunder-Driving Soldiers*, *Qi Circulation Diagrams*, *Twelve Precepts for Summoning Wind and Cloud*, *Tortoise Classic of Water Shrinking*, and *Divine Classic of Uprooting Trees*—these and other secret texts are beyond counting. Yet when one examines them closely, are they not also difficult? Their meanings are abstruse, their words sprawling.

Should some, after receiving the precepts, abstain from drink for life, or others, upon mastering the method, forswear meat for their entire clan—once such vows are taken, no other observances may be followed. Should one’s practice deviate or reverse, dire calamity will strike, beyond swift remedy. In my humble view, this is not yet perfection.

One day, the recluse Liu Han of Mount Luofu sought audience. I said to him: “There exist ancient texts of profound secrecy—have you obtained them?” He replied: “I have.” Liu Han, however, deemed this insufficient and produced a purple satchel from his desk. After burning incense and bowing in reverence, he opened the satchel, drew forth a book, and presented it to me, saying: “The Yellow Emperor, having defeated and slain Chiyou on the wilds of Banquan, concealed this in the celestial treasury. Thereafter, it was transmitted to Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu. In the Warring States, it was lost. The First Emperor of Qin alone recovered it, enlisting the aid of spirits in secret, and with their support, unified the realm—only to lose it again through his own impiety. Through the Qin and Han dynasties, it passed into the hands of various lords, scattering far and wide.

Alas! Some obtained it but failed to uphold it; others practiced it without reverence—none succeeded. Only five men—Chen Ping of the Former Han, Deng Yu of the Later Han, Zhuge Liang of Shu, Guo Ziyi and Li Jing of Tang—truly grasped it. With utmost care and devotion, they wielded it to devise stratagems beyond mortal comprehension. In every campaign, sally, raid, or ambush, thunder, wind, lightning, and rain would arrive precisely as summoned. Since their time, this method has vanished from the world.

I, your humble servant, have lived in seclusion on Mount Luofu for many years. My late master treasured this text for generations, once admonishing me: ‘Should a sagely and true sovereign arise, and a true adept assist him, you must present this.’ If you, my lord, can practice it with reverence and unwavering faith, your achievements will rival those of the Five Masters.’

I served him for nearly half a year, during which I sometimes heard voices at my ear speaking of matters critical to the state and military. Yet when I turned, no one was there. My doubts dissolved as understanding dawned. The voice declared: ‘I am a spirit of the Six Jia. Do not doubt.’ From then on, my reverence deepened, and the whispers at my ear—reports of daily events—became too numerous to recount.

When I later attended Your Majesty in reclaiming the rebel lands, our advance was as effortless as splitting bamboo. This was not due to my own cunning or foresight, but to the power of the Six Spirits. On campaign, Wang Quanfu, Cui Yandi, Liu Guangyi, Cao Bin, and others knew only that I served these spirits. I would tell them: ‘On such-and-such a day, rain; on another, wind; on yet another, fire will consume the enemy camp.’ Not once did I err. This method is a swift and wondrous shortcut to the mysterious—how could Liu Han have been an ordinary man? Later, he vanished without trace, as if spirited away. Could it be that Heaven itself bestowed this upon our Song?

This text distills the secrets of all schools, a truly esoteric and untransmitted work. I have recorded its contents faithfully and now humbly submit it for Your Majesty’s perusal. From beginning to end, its incantations and talismans number little more than a thousand characters. I beseech Your Majesty to store it in the Jade Coffer, that it may perpetually safeguard the dynasty for ten thousand years, by the grace of the divine.

On the first day of the seventh month of the fourth year of the *Kaibao* era, by imperial decree, it was sealed in the Jade Coffer and placed in the Secret Archives.

*Preface to the Origin of the* Divine Classic of the Six Jia

In ancient times, Chiyou rebelled, and the Yellow Emperor fought him repeatedly without success. The Emperor said: “I have heard that in the age of Fuxi, the world knew no war...”

Now, Chiyou was but a commoner who had spawned malevolent qi, and though I attacked him repeatedly, I could not prevail—this was my failure. Suddenly, before my eyes, a five-colored cloud descended from the sky. From within the cloud emerged six jade maidens bearing a book, and two youths who declared: “By the sacred command of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden, we present the *Three Scrolls of the Classic of the Six Jia Talismans*, that your wish to subdue him may be fulfilled.” This text reveals the fortunes and misfortunes of Heaven and Earth, the auspices and omens of the Eight Trigrams. It discerns the shifts of wind and cloud, recognizes the success or failure of qi and seasons, observes the waxing and waning of sun and moon, expounds the sequence and inversion of yin and yang, comprehends the good and ill of stars, and knows the victory or defeat of human affairs. This art is the method of ten thousand transformations.

The Emperor knelt in reverence to receive it, whereupon the two youths and the jade maidens ascended upon the cloud and departed. The Emperor then opened the case and obtained the *Three Scrolls of the Classic of the Yin Talismans*. The upper scroll expounds the arts of immortals refining the elixir and embracing the One, teaching the methods of longevity. The middle scroll sets forth the ways to pacify the realm, stabilize the state, and comfort the people. The lower scroll discusses matters of warfare and conquest, for the Six Jia is the method of the Mysterious Maiden.

Having received it, the Emperor established an altar, forged seals and swords, and, following its precepts, battled Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu. Thereafter, he achieved victory and concealed the text within the Golden Hall. Later, during great upheaval, it was retrieved by Chaohuang Yang and transmitted to the mortal world. Those who obtain it are blessed by karmic fortune; those who encounter it prevail as if by divine power. It must be guarded with care and never passed to the unworthy.

The Six Ding spirits are the true deities of the world, unlike ordinary beings. The Azure Dragon, Hall of Light, and Sun spirits, ever attendant upon the jade maidens, are summoned to serve within Heaven and Earth. To conceal one’s form and vanish, hold a blade in the left hand, hold the breath, and with the right hand trace a circle. If the evil one is within, draw a six-foot enclosure outside; if the evil one is without, draw it inside. In the wilds, construct the enclosure there and transform the spirits. Use six rods, each one foot and two inches long. Arrange them in sequence according to the Azure Dragon of each ten-day period, placing the counting rods directly before the Jade Maiden’s gate. With the left hand, draw the rods across to seal the gate, then depart through the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal. Once the gate is sealed, the body’s form is concealed.

For each rod, envision a person in the position of the *zi* hour. When the Jade Maiden reaches the Greater Yin, dwell upon the thought that outsiders cannot see you. First recite the incantation to purify mouth and body, form the seal with the left hand, grasp the sword in the right, step the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, loosen the hair, and brandish the sword. After reciting the purification incantations, close the eyes, silently intone the names of the Seven Stars once, and sever the connection with the local earth deity. When reciting the incantation, draw qi from the direction and blow it forth; advance and retreat while pinching fire. This method is employed in military maneuvers—whether facing inauspicious spirits or malevolent forces, one may vanish into the earth to evade them. Outnumbered or surrounded by ten thousand soldiers, gaze toward the Celestial Stem, draw qi from the indicated direction, and depart; a thousand troops will not perceive you, nor ten thousand see you. This esoteric oral transmission is priceless, its secrets not to be divulged for any treasure. It is the nation’s safeguard, never to be revealed to others.

*End of the First Scroll of the* True Classic of the Six Yin Cavern’s Subtle Transformations of the Hidden Dao
*Second Scroll of the* True Classic of the Six Yin Cavern’s Subtle Transformations of the Penetrating Dao

*The Upper Transmission of the* Mysterious Cavern Classic of the Six Exclusions and Jade Maiden

The Most High Lord Lao said: To enter the Dao, one must first delve into its profundities. The subtle and abstruse principles—mobilizing troops, setting forth, guarding the Dao and concealing the form, dispelling evil and expelling wickedness, preserving and protecting the original true—are the most essential of my gates, the means to ascend to the ranks of immortals. Moreover, this method opens the profound path of the pure Heaven and penetrates the abstruse depths of the turbid Earth. Its principles illuminate past and present, its Dao crowns all arts.

For the self, it brings benefit: one may approach officials and superiors, gain audience with kings and nobles, expel ghosts and avert calamities, attract blessings and summon fortune, dispatch flying talismans and moving seals, subdue raging demons, seek the Dao and attain immortality, and act as one desires. For the state, it brings benefit: one may mobilize troops, establish order and discipline, mitigate floods and droughts, eradicate famine and suffering, inspire dreams in kings and lords, harmonize the hearts of all beings, traverse waters and scale mountains, and traverse perilous paths in seclusion. Without this method, how could one ascend to the profound principles so effortlessly?

The Most High Lord Lao said: I transmit this classic and its methods to circulate among humankind, to serve the needs of the virtuous. Those who are not its proper recipients must not privately peruse it. It may be shared with one’s disciples at the cost of a thousand gold, but the *Six Yin Classic* must never be revealed. From ancient times to the present, there has never been one who did not employ this method to attain the Dao. Should it be misused by guards, soldiers, or officials, retribution will swiftly follow—misfortune, stagnation, calamity, and adversity will arise. If one who is not of the Dao, though sincere and offering worldly wealth, transmits it carelessly, the punishment shall be doubled.

The Most High Lord Lao said: Those who wish to transmit this method must first bathe and purify themselves, approaching with solemnity. Light incense at the stove, gaze toward the Northern Asterism, and direct the heart in prayer. The disciple of the Most High declares: On such-and-such a year, month, and day, I received the *Mysterious Cavern Classic of the Six Exclusions and Jade Maiden*. I humbly pray that Heaven bestow blessings and protection, that Earth grant auspicious fortune, that the Great Dao be swiftly accomplished, and that my wishes be soon fulfilled.

After receiving this classic and its methods, the disciple vows to practice it perpetually, never to speak lightly or deceitfully, never to recklessly reveal it to the unworthy, never to employ it for perverse ends, and never to seek杂慕. Having obtained this method, the disciple aspires to seek longevity, benefit the people, aid the state, retreat from the turbid and enter the pure, and eradicate demons and slay evil.

May the Three Heavens bear witness in their great clarity, and may all things under heaven come to know. Bestow upon this disciple the power of spiritual communion, that my intentions may be fulfilled. Should I ever recklessly engage in demonic or perverse acts, I willingly accept the punishment of Heaven, and the sagely immortals shall withhold their protection. Hasten now, as the law commands!

**The Essential Secrets of the Six Yin**
The Six Yin correspond to the yin aspects of the Six Jia. The yin of Jiazi is Dingmao; the yin of Jiaxu is Dingchou; the yin of Jiashen is Dinghai; the yin of Jiawu is Dingyou; the yin of Jiachen is Dingwei; and the yin of Jialin is Dingsi. The Six Ding constitute the Six Yin, just as the Six Jia serve as the yang generals, while the Six Ding are the yin spirits. The reason for employing the Six Ding rather than the Six Yang is that yin represents *wu* (non-being). *Wu* possesses the power of transformation—it can be both existent and non-existent, moving between life and death, and encompassing both concealment and revelation. Like the use of military strategy in war, the Six Yin are formless, yet their application yields immediate response.

Those who walk the Dao employ yin, while those without the Dao employ yang. Yang can be measured, but yin remains unfathomable. The preceding scroll exclusively describes the rites for invoking the Six Ding.

Some may ask: Since the Six Ding are formless, why perform rites for them? The answer lies in the union of form and formlessness—by offering sacrifices to the formless spirits, the tangible and intangible merge. Thus, one visualizes the spirits, clacks the teeth, silently recites the invocation, and verbally petitions them, aided by fragrant wine and fine offerings. Following the prescribed method ensures spiritual resonance.

In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor waged seventy-two battles against Chiyou, he fell into a deep slumber during the day and dreamed of a divine being who taught him a secret method. Upon awakening, he found the method within a sealed pouch, titled *The Six Yin Cavern Secrets*—the esoteric art of the Six Ding, a system of the Six Jia’s flying palaces and transformative techniques. By adhering to this method, he ultimately vanquished Chiyou. This is the orthodox and mysterious art of the Supreme Unity and Primordial Perfection, not a demonic or perverse practice.

Those who receive its transmission must submit a memorial to the Celestial Bureau, presenting it to the Supreme Emperor, and swear an oath never to recklessly invoke demonic or perverse acts. Should one act deceitfully or improperly, the Six Ding spirits will hold them accountable, and they shall incur the severe punishment of Heaven. Only with a rectified heart and conduct can one employ this method effectively.

The Most High Lord Lao said: In the era of Great Peace, this method was bestowed by the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden upon the Youxiong clan. The Youxiong clan passed it to Feng Hou, who transmitted it to the Great Mystery Master Yellowstone Elder, who in turn bestowed it upon Zhang Zifang. Since its dissemination among humanity, it has been transmitted to those deemed worthy.

The Dinghai Jade Maiden can also split metals and stones and cleave the earth to open paths. In heaven, she presides over the black qi of water and the storage of winter, guarding the essence and kidneys, corresponding to dark stone.

The Dingyou Jade Maiden governs rivers and seas. She can stir winds and waves, scour sands to breach banks, and turn back tides to engulf the sun. She can also blow a single leaf into a boat of olive wood to ferry people across. In heaven, she presides over the white qi of metal and the harvest of autumn, guarding the lungs and corporeal soul, corresponding to white stone.

The Dingwei Jade Maiden governs mountains and waterways. She can transform yin soldiers to aid in battles and rescue those in peril—whether from childbirth, water, fire, or weapons. In heaven, she presides over the yellow qi of earth’s virtue, the surplus of the four seasons, guarding the spleen and stomach, corresponding to yellow stone.

The Dingsi Jade Maiden governs cities and altars. She can arrange formations to break sieges and capture cities or fortresses. She can also exhale to cure untimely chills and fevers. In heaven, she presides over the red qi of fire and the growth of summer, guarding the human heart and spirit, corresponding to red stone.

**Method for Constructing the Altar**
Use eighteen bamboo stakes: six measuring two feet and five inches, six measuring five feet, and six measuring four feet, arranged in three layers and nailed together. First, nail the five-foot stakes in the center, positioning six of them to form six sides. Place the True Martial Seal and a mirror (approximately two feet in diameter) atop this layer. Next, nail the four-foot stakes around them to mark the positions of the Six Ding Jade Maidens. On the central and second layers, hang twelve five-colored banners, tying them to the bamboo stakes according to their directional correspondences: black for the north-northwest (the *hai-zi* direction), green for the northeast (*yin-mao*), red for the southeast (*si-wu*), and white for the southwest (*shen-you*). Four additional banners are placed at the sides of the *chou* (north), *chen* (east), *wei* (west), and *xu* (north) directions, each four feet square and yellow in color. Finally, nail the remaining six stakes, each two feet and five inches long, and drape them with six strips of clean cloth.

Once the altar is laid out, use crimson thread to connect the three layers, forming six gates. Erect Six Ding banners at each gate, matching their colors to their directional positions. Inscribe each position with its respective talisman, ensuring all six face outward from the altar while their backs point inward. Prepare six wooden swords, six wooden knives, six small crossbows (each with two arrows), three halberds, and three spears, to be used by the Six Ding as needed.

At the central position, honor the True Martial’s station with offerings of wine, dishes, cakes, and three incense burners. On the third layer, present offerings of the five grains, mixed millet, vegetables, fruits, fresh fish, and dried venison (made from camphor and willow wood), along with six cups of wine and seven *huanxi* (joyous) balls.

On the grand assembly day, at the *jiazi* hour of the second watch of the night, face north and burn incense in a blazing fire. Gaze upon the North Star, earnestly pray as before, hold this scripture, and bow deeply to offer incense again. With a heart poured forth and spirit gathered, I prostrate and offer incense once more, pledging my sincerity.

I, a disciple of the Most High Lord Lao, have long cultivated purity, reverently guarding the celestial mysteries and shunning the mundane to devote myself to the Great Dao. With utmost reverence, I humbly submit this petition, beseeching the true numina to look upon me with compassion. I have received the *Scripture of the Six Yin Jade Maidens of the Most High Lord Lao’s Cavern Mystery*, and wish to practice its methods—may the profound powers witness my resolve.

After receiving this teaching, I dare not treat it lightly. Unless in dire emergencies to aid the state or save the people, I swear never to misuse it. Before the sacred presence, I solemnly vow these words.

Should I fail to uphold these vows, I willingly accept punishment for my transgressions. In all matters of urgency or delay, in times of salvation and response, may the numinous powers grant their resonant protection.

I prostrate and offer incense, advancing to silently intone: I now beseech two or three Jade Maidens to serve as my envoys, ascending to the celestial court and descending to traverse the world, wielding talismans and flying seals to dispel evil and subdue demons. May all their movements be at my command. I humbly pray that the sagely wisdom may deign to witness this.

Again I prostrate and offer incense, praying: Having presented my petition before the sacred presence, I now implore the host of Perfected Ones to ever grant their protection and safeguarding.

After the rites conclude and the altar is withdrawn, on the night of *guihai*, I shall first draft a petition and talisman to summon the Six Ding Jade Maidens. Below is the prescribed format for the petition.

**Petition Format for the Grand Assembly**

[State] one’s native place, dharma rank, and name.

To the right, I, [Name], humbly reveal my sincere heart, venturing to address the True Origin. The purpose of this petition is as follows:

Now, regarding [specific matter], I have heard of the True Writ of the Great Dao, the esoteric scriptures of the Cavern Mystery, the Six Yin Jade Maidens, and the Six Ding Great Spirits—whose benevolence pervades the Three Realms and extends universally to the Four Directions, aiding the state, delivering the people, pacifying humanity, and benefiting all beings.

Deeply mindful that I, [Name], dwell in the mundane world, my body bound to the dusty realm, I aspire to practice these methods but have yet to receive their profound mysteries. First, I received from the lineage of [Master’s Name] the ancient methods of the *Yellow Emperor’s Cavern Mystery Scripture*, including the secret talismans, seals, incantations, and oral instructions of the Six Yin Jade Maidens and the Six Ding Great Spirits.

I take refuge in and revere these teachings, aiding the true Dao, shielding my family, preserving my life, and assisting the state in saving the people.

Now, on this [specific month and day] of the *jiazi* cycle, I humbly prepare these offerings and present my heartfelt sincerity. On the day of *guihai*, I shall formally submit this petition to invoke the descent of the true numina, praying for their gracious witness.

The essential petition is as follows:

To the right, I reverently beseech:
- The True Lord of Infinite Benevolence and Blessing, the *Dingmao* Jade Maiden;
- The True Lord of Vast Heaven and True Reality, the *Dingchou* Jade Maiden;
- The True Lord of the Capital Prefecture and Primordial Benevolence, the *Dinghai* Jade Maiden;
- The True Lord of Subduing Warriors and Benevolent Repose, the *Dingyou* Jade Maiden;
- The True Lord of Unmatched Benevolence and Ultimate Perfection, the *Dingwei* Jade Maiden;
- The True Lord of Lofty Excellence and Virtuous Power, the *Dingsi* Jade Maiden.

I humbly await their true compassion to grant my request. May they deign to focus their attention and look upon my private intentions with favor.

On that day, may they specially descend in cloud chariots to alight upon the altar, secretly manifesting their responses and awaiting the resonance of their numinous power. I venture to offend the true majesty.

My heartfelt devotion is beyond measure; my urgency knows no bounds. I respectfully submit this petition for your consideration.

Respectfully submitted.
Year ___ Month ___ Day
[Dharma Rank] Disciple [Name] petitions.

For external use, securely seal with a circular cover. Include six portions each of gold coins and cloud-horses, affixed with the six talismans of the petitioner’s own body, along with the seal impression and the dispatch talisman for the divine messengers. Burn the gold coins and send them forth, entrusting them to be delivered. Arrange an incense altar according to rank, bow twice toward the petitioning seat, and present the matters stated within.

Additionally, submit a separate sealed petition to the Perfected Warrior, True Lord.

**Petition Formula for the Perfected Warrior**

I humbly await the Perfected Warrior, True Lord, to descend to the altar site on the appointed day and witness the covenant in practice.

On the *Jiazi* day, the officiant must refrain from careless killing of living beings, maintaining a compassionate and harmonious disposition. Set up the altar station and proceed according to the prescribed rites. No unauthorized persons may enter the altar space; all tasks must be performed outside. Keep monks, nuns, women, elder brothers’ sons, and all poultry, dogs, and livestock from violating the precincts.

The offering of incense and the pouring of wine must be performed by the officiant alone, approaching the altar directly.

First, present the invocation before the True Lord of the *Dingmao* day, then burn incense along with one talisman—this is the matching talisman. Recite the petitioner’s own incantation and draw the qi of the corresponding direction to blow upon it.

Next, proceed in order to the True Lords of *Dingchou*, *Dinghai*, *Dingyou*, *Dingwei*, and *Dingsi*, invoking each in turn, burning their respective talismans, and drawing the qi of each direction to blow upon the altar.

I humbly beseech the true numen to deign in great creation, descending in the ritual chariot upon my earnest supplication. Once all have been invoked in sequence:

With the left hand’s middle finger and the right hand’s *Great Execution Seal*, strike the teeth thirty-six times and recite the *Hidden Words of the Six Yin and Six Ding Jade Maidens and Eight Transcendent Essences*:

**Incantation:**
*"The radiance of the Nine Qi of the Dragon,
The Five Peaks follow in its train.
The Four Saints of Heavenly Obscurity,
The Ten Origins and Eight Poles.
The Dipper Star of the Northern Numen,
The Twelve Daily Officers.
The Six Ding Jade Maidens,
May they bestow their true light.
Assist the dharma’s command and restraint—
I invoke the Mandate of the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Cavernous Subtleties."*

Recite this three times. Then, in sequence, employ the hand seals of the Six Ding’s own body and summon the Jade Maidens by name, drawing the qi of each direction to blow into the altar.

Burn the six talismans of the petitioner’s own body within the altar, strike the teeth, close the eyes, and visualize the six Jade Maidens descending to the altar site.

First, invite the Perfected Warrior, True Lord, to descend to the altar. Bow twice, offer incense, and pray:

*"I now invoke the Perfected Warrior, True Lord. Next, I burn incense to summon the Second and Third Jade Maidens, who are already descending to their seats. I bow my head and prostrate myself again.*

*I am a disciple of the Supreme Venerable Lord, long devoted to the sagely Dao, desiring eternal life, treading the path of purity, practicing profound and wondrous deeds, ever drawing near to the supreme Dao, and cultivating the sagely path. Above, I offer advancement to the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors; below, I relieve the calamities of the myriad people. I uphold the dharma registers and act in accordance with the Daoist canons.*

*Now, I wish to establish an altar and adorn a purified chamber. Following the canons, I prepare offerings to honor the True Lord. I rely upon your majestic radiance and humbly beseech your penetrating insight.*

*Today, I seek the wondrous principles to pacify the nation and secure the people, to deploy water talismans, to inspect and govern demons. Above, to assist the state’s needs; below, to sustain human lives. To seek immortality and study the Dao, to benefit and succor the living.*

*In all matters great or small, I depend upon the divine might of the immortals to act as my envoys, to aid my practice, to heed my commands, and to comply in all directions—east, west, south, and north. When named and their seals are drawn, may they arrive instantly. In every summons, may they respond with utmost urgency. Whatever I consult, let there be no breach of faith. May their words be remembered and engraved upon my heart and bones."*

Once more I offer incense and bow twice, then softly approach and humbly petition:

“I receive the command of the Most High and the decree of the Jade Emperor to harmonize the cosmos, pacify and assist the state, dispatch troops and mobilize forces, expel demons and dispel evil. Today, I honor the immortal spirits, that they may serve as my eternal aides. You must adapt to my strategies and follow my works. Should any disobey, I shall enforce the command of the Most High and the decree of the Jade Emperor to sever your form and extinguish your being. I humbly beseech your numinous efficacy—may you incline your divine hearing.”

Again I bow, offering incense to the True Martial Lord. Thrice I lift the wine, then kneel and prostrate, knocking my teeth together, and pray:

“On this day, month, and hour, your disciple [Name] reverently observes the night of the Grand Assembly, offering solemn sacrifice before the two or three Jade Maidens. I reflect that my nature is spontaneous, my heart receives the celestial script, my original master has made covenant, and the Most High has transmitted the details. Now, at this Grand Assembly, I modestly present this libation. The Wind Earl sweeps clean, the Rain Master purifies the altar. Your devoted disciple, with a heart fond of true auspices, declares his name and surname, wishing to receive your radiant presence. I vow lifelong devotion, never to forget. Today’s offering includes fine meats, dried delicacies, and fragrant incense; large jujubes from Anyi, small and plump; pure wine with floating froth, fresh seasonal vegetables, and white rice—excellent grain. May you drink to intoxication and eat to satiety, then follow my movements. Whatever prayers I utter, may each be fulfilled. Ever attend me, ever protect my side. My wishes shall prosper as I desire. Wherever I go, may you accompany the true ones. In concealment or manifestation, through all journeys, may you ensure eternal peace. Swiftly attain the great Dao, soon reach the immortal realm. In all my sufferings, may the true bring auspiciousness. In all my desires, may the true follow and fulfill. Defending the nation against foes, may all affairs be favorable. Guard and shield my body, concealed with heaven and earth.”

I pour the libation, humbly invoking your partaking.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Most High.*

Again I bow and offer incense, reciting my personal mantra one by one, then draw in a breath of qi and blow it upon the altar. Secretly, I pray:

“O Ding-Mao Jade Maiden, I have obtained the *True Writ of the Six Yin Essences from the Cavern of Mysteries* of the Most High. I know the names of the spirits, the names of the immortals. With this method, I summon immortals; with this method, I command spirits. They traverse the Three Realms, emerging from darkness into light. In movement, stillness, sitting, or standing, all depend on the immortal true ones. Summoned, they arrive instantly; invoked, they descend at once. All affairs of the human world shall be made known to me. May my gratitude be manifest—do not defy me.”

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*

I draw qi from the Ding-Mao direction and blow it forth, then likewise from Ding-Chou and the remaining directions. Once more, I devoutly offer incense and bow.

Rising, I step toward Ding-Si, circling the altar to the left, beginning my pace eastward. I recite the incantation:

“Empowering the Six Yin, emerging from darkness into light,
Fearless and undaunted, without alarm.
Follow the turning of my talismans, pursue the path of my seals.
Dispel ten thousand calamities, gather blessings upon this body.
Active by day, concealed by night—do not disobey my command.”

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*

Thus I circle the altar thrice, then return to my position, offer incense, and bow again. Taking one talisman, I roll it into a pellet and swallow it with the wine from the corresponding position. I bow in gratitude, then move to the next position, bow, and consume another talisman. In this manner, I complete the six positions, ingesting six talismans.

Standing upright before the altar, I offer incense and bow once more. Silently, I recite:

“I uphold this method, and thus I am the lord; the spirits are my ministers. Whatever I desire, the spirits shall follow my will. From this moment onward, never leave my side. Six portions of golden coin assist the true journey. In all undertakings, do not breach our covenant.”

After burning the paper money, I clear the altar and consume the offerings myself. If not eaten, they are buried. The altar is then dismissed.

This is the ritual arrangement for the Grand Assembly; lesser gatherings differ. On the day of the dispersing *jia* within each ten-day period, when the corresponding Jade Maiden is honored, prepare a portion of paper money and horses for the offering. The sacrificial items include a portion of food, with the rest being incense, tea, and wine.

The Yellow Emperor said: Those who serve the Six Ding, desiring longevity, must observe the Six Ding days without engaging in lust or taking life. Further, they should cultivate inner and outer essence, abiding in centered rectitude—then they will not exceed six assemblies. The Six Ding will present you with the returning elixir, and through your affairs, you may attain the body of the Dao and become an earthbound immortal, thus achieving longevity.

If one seeks to pacify the nation and secure the state, to lead armies and campaign beyond the borders, achieving victory in every battle—those who serve the Six Ding, when the spirit manifests at the six assemblies, will clearly perceive its form. Do not harbor impure thoughts; be reverent and sincere, without wayward imaginings. Those who offend with perverse intent will be slain instantly.

The Six Ding can advance or retreat, defend cities, engage enemies, and deploy the eight extraordinary formations. They can also penetrate the secrets of enemy states, discern the hearts of adversaries, and comprehend all strategies and plans. In all practices, establishing merit and founding enterprises, commencing construction, marriages, gambling, competitions, praying for rain or wind, subduing bandits, destroying temples, dispelling poisons, slaying monsters, beheading dragons, or driving away tigers—there is nothing they do not verify.

For healing illnesses and eliminating harm, this method contains its own regulations. Those who serve but do not seek longevity, desiring wealth and honor instead, may have the Six Ding drive forth treasures and manage the workings of creation.

If one serving wishes to know whether their parents are alive or deceased, upon invocation, the answer will come at once. If one desires to know their own future affairs—length of life or brevity—invoking the Six Ding will reveal the truth. In all undertakings, there will be corresponding responses.

At the first Grand Assembly on the *jiazi* day, consume the talisman; at the second assembly, it is unnecessary. If beginning with the first assembly, consume six talismans in one ten-day period, totaling thirty-six talismans over six assemblies.

If at the first Grand Assembly one consumes thirty-six talismans, there is no need to consume them at the second. Perform the rites according to the prescribed form. Should one fail to complete the six Grand Assemblies within a year, fulfilling them over two years will suffice, including the minor assemblies without omission.

For all assemblies, when inscribing the Six Ding talismans and other talismans, use cinnabar on yellow paper, and impress them with the True Warrior seal. *Secret Repository of the Mysterious Transformations: The Six Yin Cavern Essentials of the Hidden Dao of the Eighteen Cyclical Branches, Scroll the Middle* concludes here.

**Method for Erecting the Altar**
**Diagram of the Altar’s Form**

For the altar’s construction, prepare eighteen poles: six measuring four feet in length, six measuring two feet and five inches, and six measuring five feet and five inches. First, take the five-foot-five-inch poles and drive them into the center, arranging them into six sides. Cover the top with clean cloth, forming a square or circle approximately two feet across. Next, affix the four-foot poles, followed by the two-foot-five-inch poles. Once secured, encircle them with crimson thread to delineate six sides, forming a square or circle approximately six feet across. The second tier should measure four feet, and the third two feet.

On the second tier, place twelve millstones, one for each branch from *zi* to *hai*, painted in their corresponding colors. For instance, *hai* and *zi* belong to Water and should be black; arrange them in order. Beneath each tier, place clean cloth or small tables on all six sides, each bearing a wooden sword, standing at the altar’s base.

At the center of the first tier, place the True Warrior seal alongside a round mirror. Affix the Six Ding banners to the poles: *ding-chou* in yellow, *ding-mao* in blue-green, *ding-si* in red, *ding-wei* in yellow, *ding-you* in white, and *ding-hai* in black.

On the second tier, arrange the Six Ding positions. At the *ding-you* position, place a small crossbow with two arrows. At the *ding-si* position, place a small halberd. At the *ding-hai* position, place a sword. At the *ding-mao* position, place another sword. The remaining two positions remain unoccupied.

Prepare six jujube-wood tablets, painting the true forms of the Jade Maidens upon them. Beneath each image, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar, placing each at its respective position. Arrange them according to the method, each side facing outward, backs toward one another.

When initiating rites, perform them before the deity corresponding to the occasion. For regular worship, set the offering mat before the *ding-hai* side, facing north toward the True Warrior.

**Offerings within the Altar**
Six portions of mixed grains from the Five Grains.

Six censers. Six cups of tea. Six strips of pure cloth. Six fresh fish. Six plates of dried venison. Six cups of wine. These are the rites for the grand assembly. For minor assemblies, perform the offerings to the deity of the respective ten-day period, burning six portions of spirit money. During rites, never utter the term "Six Ding," for the Jade Maidens hold this character taboo. Refer only to the "Second and Third Jade Maidens"; in the grand assembly of the *wu* noon, there are but six. The *jia-zi* day marks the grand assembly. For other rites, observe only the Six Ding days, offering at each respective position. For instance, on the *ding-chou* day, use the prescribed items only for the *ding-chou* deity, while the remaining five positions receive only incense and tea. On the *jia-zi* grand assembly day, perform the rites as before, offering to all.

When not in use, dismantle the altar. However, after the sixth assembly, leave it intact for further rites. Generally, when the six rituals reach completion, a devout practitioner may perform the annual rites—this is most auspicious. Upon completing the six rites, retain the altar within the chamber, entering and exiting alone each day, strictly forbidding others from seeing it. For within a year, there are six grand assemblies and thirty-six minor ones. If affairs are numerous and the year’s rites insufficient, perform one grand assembly. Never neglect a minor assembly, lest it invite misfortune.

In all invocations and supplications, the drawing of talismans upon the altar, the method of depicting divine images, and the inscription of names must adhere strictly to the prescribed forms.

*Ding-mao* Talisman

*Ding-hai* Talisman
*Ding-you* Talisman

Six Yin Talismans

These talismans are inscribed on jujube wood tablets, each one *cun* and five *fen* in size. One side bears the talisman, while the reverse is carved with the name of the Jade Maiden. They are worn within the hair and must not be removed except when combing.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-mao* is named *Zubao Zhong*, with the title *Wuji Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Ultimateless). This talisman is written on yellow paper and placed at the station of the *Ding-mao* Jade Maiden, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial. The incantation reads:

*"O True One of the Ultimateless, embodied in the Day of the Foot.
Be summoned by me, act as I command.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Upon completion, recite the incantation three times. Draw the *qi* of the eastern direction and blow it onto the talisman. With both hands, form the *Dashai* mudra, and tread the *Ding* step upon the solar path. Conceal the form, and so forth.

*Ding-mao* Union Talisman
This talisman, inscribed at the *Ding-mao* station in red on yellow paper, is made in sets of nine following the previous method and consumed with wine.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-chou* is named *Qi Wushang*, with the title *Hengtian Zhenjun* (True Lord Traversing Heaven). This talisman is placed beneath the station of the *Ding-chou* Jade Maiden, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial for general use. The incantation reads:

*"O Most Sagely of Great Harmony, True One Traversing Heaven.
Be directed by me, follow my decree.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Upon completion, draw the *qi* of the northern direction and blow it onto the talisman, reciting the mantra three times.

*Ding-chou* Union Talisman
This talisman, following the same incantation, mudra, and *qi* as before, is made in sets of nine and consumed with wine from its respective station.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-hai* is named *Luming Ji*, with the title *Dufu Zhenjun* (True Lord of the Capital Prefecture). This talisman is inscribed in red on yellow paper and placed beneath the station of the *Ding-hai* Jade Maiden, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial. The incantation reads:

*"O True Lord of Broad Yang, named Luming.
Be directed by me, assist my actions.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Recite the incantation three times and draw the *qi* of the northern direction into the talisman.

*Ding-hai* Union Talisman
This talisman, following the same method of inscription, incantation, mudra, and *qi* as before, is made in sets of nine and consumed with wine from its respective station.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-you* is named *Jiuqin Ling*, with the title *Yafu Zhenjun* (True Lord Subordinate). This talisman is inscribed in red on yellow paper and placed at the *Ding-you* station, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial. Draw the *qi* of the western direction and blow it onto the talisman. The incantation reads:

*"O Spirit of Salvation and Reverence, Great True One Subordinate.
Be directed by me, aid my actions.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

*Ding-you* Union Talisman
This talisman, following the same method of inscription, incantation, mudra, and *qi* as before, is made in sets of nine and consumed with wine from its respective station.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-wei* is named *Cheng Suling*, with the title *Wubi Zhenjun* (Incomparable True Lord). This talisman is inscribed in red on yellow paper and placed before the *Ding-wei* station, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial. The incantation reads:

*"Incomparable True Lord, named Suling.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Recite the incantation three times and draw the *qi* of the southern direction into the talisman.

*Ding-wei* Union Talisman
This talisman, following the same method of inscription, incantation, mudra, and *qi* as before, is made in sets of nine and consumed with wine from its respective station.

The Jade Maiden of *Ding-si* is named *Zhu Fucheng*, with the title *Gaoshang Zhenjun* (Supreme True Lord). This talisman is inscribed in red on yellow paper and placed at the *Ding-si* station, with an additional inscription affixed to the front of the memorial. The incantation reads:

*"Supreme True One, named Fucheng.
Be directed by me, attend my words.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Draw the *qi* of the southern direction and blow it onto the talisman.

*Ding-si* Union Talisman
Following the same incantation, *qi*, and method as before, form into pellets and consume with wine from its respective station.

For all Jade Maiden talismans, when summoning for use, inscribe the invocation phrase by phrase. This may be done on the memorial or on its reverse, detailing the matter at hand. Seal with the *Zhenwu* seal on the front and the *Liuding* seal on the reverse. Invoke using the Jade Maiden spirit incantation, *qi*, and mudra as before—great spiritual efficacy will be attained.

Another method: Use a talisman two *cun* in size. Inscribe the talisman on one side and engrave the name on the reverse, writing in red on jujube wood. Recite the incantation three times and place it upon the altar.

Days for the Descent of the *Liuding* Talismans and Names:
*Ding-mao* Jade Maiden: *Song Juanwenbo* – descends on *zi-chou* days
*Ding-chou* Jade Maiden: *Liang Qiyuangong* – descends on *yin-mao* days
*Ding-hai* Jade Maiden: *Yao Maowendao* – descends on *si-wu* days
*Ding-you* Jade Maiden: *Shen Qiaowenqing* – descends on *xu-hai* days
*Ding-wei* Jade Maiden: *Zhu Diaoshengtong* – descends on *shen-you* days
*Ding-si* Jade Maiden: *Chen Juntinqing* – descends on *chen-si* days

The True Warrior Seal measures two *cun* and four *fen* in width and three *cun* and two *fen* in length. There are two forms: the Yang Seal and the Yin Seal. For these two seals, select *geng-shen*, *yi-si*, *jia-yin*, or *ji-hai* days to carve the Yin and Yang seals from jujube wood, then wear them on the arms—hang the Yang Seal on the left arm and the Yin Seal on the right. When using the seal at midday, employ the Yang Seal to invoke dreams from lords and nobles. For all matters imitating Heaven and governed by Yang—such as praying for rain, sunshine, or snow—use this seal. It is the seal of the three Jade Maidens: *Ding-mao*, *Ding-chou*, and *Ding-hai*, and thus belongs to Yang. The intentions of these Jade Maidens shift in accordance with this seal, and all matters are governed by the Yang Seal. For the Yin Seal, hang it on the right arm and use it at night. For all matters imitating Earth and governed by Yin—such as seeking wealth, commanding ghosts, dispelling demons, nocturnal prayers, subterranean actions, entering water, or venturing into darkness—imprint with this Yin Seal. It is the seal of the three Jade Maidens: *Ding-si*, *Ding-wei*, and *Ding-you*, and thus belongs to Yin. These three Jade Maidens act in accordance with the seal’s use, and all matters are governed by the Yin Seal.

**Ritual for Consecrating the Seals**
After carving the two seals, perform the grand assembly on a *jia-zi* day. Set up a mat beneath the Northern Asterism and invoke: *"I respectfully invite □□□□□□□ True Lord to descend. Your servant, following the methods of the Most High, has carved the Yin and Yang Six Yin Cavern-Subtle Seals to command the Jade Maidens. May your mighty power be manifest."* First, awaken the seal’s true efficacy and confirm the covenant, then offer incense. Hold the seals in both hands, gaze at the Northern Dipper, and draw in the true *qi* of the Northern Dipper. Progressing in order to □, inhale *qi* once and blow it onto the seal. Repeat this three times for each seal. Fasten the seals with five-colored threads and wear them on the left and right arms. Wear them during consecration, use, and all movements when entering or exiting. When not in use at home, do not wear them; instead, place them on the altar for veneration. During leisure or when not in use, offer a cup of pure water in the morning as veneration—do not perform ordinary rituals. On the day of the grand assembly, strictly avoid sexual activity, impurity, or the proximity of meat and fish. Frequently swallow saliva to cleanse the five viscera. This scripture is as profound as the hidden arts of immortals, the foremost rule of all techniques, rooted in Heaven and Earth, enduring through ancient and modern times. If later generations encounter it, they are destined for immortality, blessed by past lives—this is no trivial matter. Even if unused, storing and revering it at home ensures no misfortune dares enter. Sincerity is paramount; do not treat it like other texts. Store it in a vessel of purity and tranquility, free from defilement or idle words. Do not casually handle it at inappropriate times, nor harbor impure intentions. Though intended to aid the living and the dead, misuse may bring calamity and retribution. Practitioners must uphold integrity and exercise deep caution. Utmost reverence! The adaptable methods of this Dharma gate are detailed in the following scroll.

**Methods for Using the Six Ding Jade Maidens’ Seals**
The seals’ specifications: two *cun* and four *fen* in width, three *cun* and two *fen* in length. Choose a day corresponding to the wood’s birth, harvest jujube wood, and carve the seals on a *jia-zi* or *geng-shen* day, imprinting them with talismanic scripts. Consecrate them according to the previous method; do not use them indiscriminately. In times of urgent peril, hang them and cover them with clothing to avert disaster. Store them in a pouch of crimson silk; do not let others see them, lest their efficacy wane.

**Methods of Practice**
First perform the consecration, then proceed with adaptable techniques. Consecration precedes adaptation. For all actions—invoking dreams, seeking objects, hunting, commanding troops, dispatching spirits, praying for drought or flood, ascending mountains, entering water, capturing thieves, subduing demons, seeking office, pursuing immortality, acquiring servants, welcoming or concealing gentlemen, expelling petty men, or myriad other purposes—each has its own talismanic method. Be utterly sincere and solemn; do not treat this lightly. Whether facing earth or heaven, employ them correctly. Not only do they secure the state and aid the nation, but they also protect the Dao and nurture the body. Any deviation into wickedness will bring guilt upon nine generations. Sincerity lies in venerating the two or three Jade Maidens on the crown of the head. On *geng-shen*, *yi-si*, *jia-yin*, or *ji-hai* days, take the heartwood of jujube, carve the names and talismans of the two or three Jade Maidens on each of its four sides, and place it in a pouch of five-colored silk to wear on the crown of the head. Do not remove it except when combing hair.

**Talismanic Scripts**
For all talismanic commands, use cinnabar; if unavailable, ink may suffice. For each action, face the three positions of the current ten-day period, bow, and proceed—other spirits will assist. Write the names of the three divinatory spirits of the ten-day period (the Jade Maidens) beside the talisman. Imprint it with the True Warrior Seal using cinnabar, applying both Yin and Yang seals in sequence. For Yang matters, use the Yang Seal on the left arm; for Yin matters, use the Yin Seal on the right. For ordinary talisman ingestion or use, follow this method precisely. Be meticulous and do not treat it casually.

**Responsive Talismans for Invoking Dreams (Six Methods)**
**First Method: Talisman for Invoking the Emperor’s Dream**
This talisman invokes dreams from the supreme ruler. After performing the sixfold consecration, the Jade Maidens will naturally appear. Do not burn the talisman; the Jade Maidens will take it themselves. When using this talisman, dispatch the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period, with other spirits assisting. Write this talisman in cinnabar at dawn, then inscribe the name of the Jade Maiden True Lord of the current ten-day period beside it.

First, affix the True Martial Seal, then lightly impress with the Yang Seal once, and next inscribe the Talisman for Opening the Forbidden Gate.

**Second: Talisman for Opening the Forbidden Gate**
This is the Talisman for Opening the Forbidden Gate. Inscribe it following the previous method, including the spirit’s name, and impress it with the True Martial Seal and the Yin-Yang Seals.

Hold these two talismans together before the Jade Maiden of the Three Divinations of the current ten-day period and pray: "I now seek such-and-such a matter—state your intent as you wish. Dispatch the spirits to bear these two talismans directly before the Emperor, to open the forbidden gates of the imperial court. In the dream, present this to the Emperor: ‘So-and-so of such-and-such prefecture and county, of such-and-such name and age, has practiced the Great Teaching to bring peace to the realm for the Emperor. May the Emperor protect him well and not allow harm to befall him.’ Whether seeking office or other matters, state your request as you wish."

After thus making your petition, offer a portion of clear wine and gold coins, along with the talismans, incense, tea, lamps, and vegetables, before the True Lord Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period. At the second watch of the night, recite the incantation of the Three Divinations of the current ten-day period three times. Take the paper from beneath the name of the spirit present, burn it all at once, and say: "Go swiftly, respond swiftly—do not delay." Then blow out the lamp, clear the tea, and sit again until the end of the third watch before sleeping. Within ten days, there will surely be a response. The August Lord will certainly accept the matters entrusted by the spirits; there will be no failure. This applies equally to seeking office or any other purpose.

For the method of summoning dreams through the Five Tones, follow the previous instructions for preparation and dispatch, except that the talisman for opening the forbidden door is not used. This is essential. Officials, monks, and Daoists should each apply the method according to their corresponding tone.

**Five Talismans for Summoning Dreams Through the Five Tones**
- **Gong Tone**
- **Shang Tone**
- **Jue Tone**
- **Zhi Tone**
- **Yu Tone**

These talismans summon dreams from individuals whose surnames correspond to the Five Tones. Write them using the previous method. Do not use the talisman for opening the forbidden door, and do not let commoners see it. It is essential and may be used by officials, scholars, commoners, monks, nuns, and Daoists alike—each according to their tone and surname—with unfailing efficacy.

**Method for Praying for Rain or Clear Skies**
To pray for rain, clear skies, or snow, each season has its presiding deities:
- **Spring:** True Lord Taihe, True Lord Taixuan, True Lord Taimin
- **Summer:** True Lord Shaoyi, True Lord Shaowei, True Lord Shaoming
- **Autumn:** True Lord Taiwu, True Lord Taiquan, True Lord Taigong
- **Winter:** True Lord Shaogu, True Lord Shao□, True Lord Shaoling

In spring, make offerings in the Qian-Hai direction (the direction of flourishing qi).
In summer, make offerings in the Gen-Yin location.
In autumn, make offerings in the Xun-Si direction.
In winter, make offerings in the Kun-Shen location.
These are the directions of longevity for each season.

**Three Talismans for Summoning the Seasonal True Lords**
Write these three talismans, replacing the names of the True Lords according to the season. Before the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period, pray: *"I see that the people suffer from a lack of rain, and the common folk are without livelihood. I now dispatch spirits to deliver this to the three True Lords. Tomorrow, they shall arrive at the altar in the designated direction to receive my petition."*

For spring, summer, autumn, and winter, change the offering to one portion of green coins to send them on their journey. Swiftly, swiftly—burn the paper and talisman in the Qian-Hai direction (the location for spring offerings to the True Lords Taihe, Taixuan, and Taimin). For summer, autumn, and winter, summon the respective True Lords in their designated directions. Set up the altar, and offer incense, lamps, wine, and fruit.

Light the incense, bow twice, and knock your teeth while sincerely praying: *"I have heard that the azure heavens are vast and the mysterious true ones boundless. Though I am foolish, my nature aligns with the Upper Clarity. Now the people suffer without livelihood, and I seek rain. I long for nourishing rains, or clear skies. I humbly perform this ritual, beseeching the mysterious true ones. Accept my modest offering, and may you see my heart. Take this talisman of mine and present it on my behalf. May the August Heaven look upon me with favor and grant sweet rains or clear skies. I present this earnest plea with secret talismanic script. I implore your true compassion to incline your ears and listen. Three portions of green coins are offered to send you on your journey. I await your response, which shall come without delay."*

Burn the paper along with the talisman and close the ritual.

**Talisman for Praying for Rain**
**Talisman for Praying for Clear Skies**
These talismans must be folded five times at the corners and sealed with an imprint. Use them as described above; they are talismans for petitioning the August Lord of Heaven and must not be used lightly.

**Talisman for Seeking Snow**
Follow the same method of prayer as above.

**Talisman for Summoning Wind**
If you wish to summon wind or clouds, each season has its direction:
- Spring: East
- Summer: South
- Autumn: West
- Winter: North

Notify the Jade Maiden and burn the talisman. A great call brings a great wind; a small call brings a small wind.

By such-and-such day, dispatch a set number of halberds, spears, staves, bows, and crossbows, all fully prepared, to my side. Follow my commands without delay, and the task shall be swiftly completed. Should you disobey my orders, I shall slay ghosts and execute spirits—let none say they were not warned."* Burn the talisman at once and depart.

**Second Talisman**
Inscribe this talisman with the same sincerity in cinnabar as before. Perform the Yu Step to the gate and address the Generals of the Five Roads: *"You and two or three Jade Maidens, along with the ghostly officers and soldiers, shall immediately proceed to such-and-such place to complete such-and-such task. It must be accomplished without delay—no procrastination shall be tolerated. Should you falter, I shall strike off your heads."* After the labor is done, each shall receive money and wine in gratitude for their toil.

**Urgent, urgent—by the statutes and commands!** Burn the talisman and proceed.

**Third Talisman**
Should you wish to perform this method, first announce it to the Jade Maidens and have someone inscribe the talisman to carry to the work site. Alternatively, drive it in before or after, or use a seal. Once the task is complete, burn paper money in gratitude. The divine response is unfathomable—wondrous beyond wonder.

For this method, use the True Warrior’s seal to imprint and address the Jade Maidens. Burn one talisman to the local earth deity of the new boundary and inquire: *"What strange occurrences are here?"*

**Talisman for Pursuing Souls**
This method is used to suppress enemies or for official matters. First, write the target’s name, birth year, month, day, and hour, along with the intent, beneath the talisman. Take one chicken egg, a tangle of hair, and the talisman, then crush the egg and mix it with the talisman in a container. Perform the ritual and bury it at the Ghost Gate—unceasing until the target grows dazed and stuporous as if drunk.
*Secret, secret, secret, secret, secret—do not misuse.*

Place one in your mouth, call softly, and whatever you desire will arrive. To dismiss them, burn the talisman in hand outside the gate.

**Talisman for Childbirth**
To aid delivery, inscribe four talismans. Present one to the Jade Maidens and burn three, giving them to the person requesting the talisman. Have them mix the ashes with clean water for the mother to swallow. If the child is male, have him hold the talisman in his left hand as he emerges; if female, in her right. For a stillborn, place the talisman on its crown to draw it out. For a transverse birth, the bones will soften, and delivery will follow.

**Talisman for Wrongful Death**
For those who die unjustly—by drowning, hanging, well-jumping, or sudden demise—quickly inscribe this talisman on their left or right side. Write the name of the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period and address her: *"Here lies one who has perished suddenly from such-and-such cause. I use this talisman to save them."* Command the spirits to act swiftly, rescue and restore the soul to the afflicted’s body, and revive them at once. Place the talisman in their mouth and apply three moxa cauteries to the crown—they will revive immediately.

**Talisman for Capturing Ghosts**
Inscribe in cinnabar to summon the Jade Maidens, then bury, drive in, or affix it—the ghost will perish.

**Three Talismans for Curing All Illnesses**
To employ these talismans for healing, use the three on the right to treat all ailments. Burn incense and address the Jade Maidens of the current two ten-day periods: *"I now treat so-and-so’s illness. Spirits, lend your power—follow the talisman to heal, expel ghosts, and banish evil. Upon its arrival, act without delay."* Write the Jade Maidens’ names on the talisman, burn it with true incense, and have the patient swallow it—they will recover.

**Talisman for the Plague Deity**
Inscribe this talisman on yellow paper in cinnabar. The day before use, inscribe one and perform the method before the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period: *"Carry this talisman for me to such-and-such place, to the home of so-and-so. Deities of fate, prohibitions, and their retinues—I come tomorrow to cure plague and slay ghosts. Swiftly summon the local temple spirits to await my commands. Go swiftly, go swiftly!"* Then burn it.

**Talisman for Plague Demons**
Use a sheet of paper five *cun* wide and seven *cun* long. Have the patient sign it, then inscribe the talisman over their mark. This talisman commands the Six Spirits and Deities of Fate.

**Another Talisman for Plague**
Have the person write a decorative character, then inscribe the talisman on their back to treat plague demons.

**Talisman for Ingesting to Cure Plague**
Administer this talisman with a decoction of *jiangxiang*. First, write: *"White Jade Maiden, cure the plague, seize the source of illness, and safeguard peace."* The patient will recover.

**Talisman for Verifying Illness Regardless of Distance**
To treat a patient, inscribe one talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper and stamp it with the True Warrior’s seal. First, notify the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period, then burn and observe—whatever ailment afflicts the patient will be cured. If the patient is three to five *li* away, visualize their location, address the Jade Maiden, inscribe the talisman, stamp it, burn it, and blow the ashes toward their direction. Even if they are a thousand *li* away, invoke their location—the results will be certain.

**Method for Treating Illness**
Reverently invoke:
- The *Dingmao* spirit of the *Jiazi* ten-day period,
- The *Dingchou* spirit of the *Jiaxu* ten-day period,
- The *Dinghai* spirit of the *Jiashen* ten-day period,
- The *Dingyou* spirit of the *Jiawu* ten-day period,
- The *Dingwei* spirit of the *Jiachen* ten-day period,
- The *Dingsi* spirit of the *Jiayin* ten-day period.

*"Proceed to heal the illness of so-and-so, who suffers from such-and-such ailment. I beseech you to resolve their misfortune, dispel calamity, and swiftly restore their soul. The moment the talisman arrives, act without delay!"*
**Urgent, urgent—by the statutes and commands of the Highest Clarity!**
Once the command is given, proceed at once to heal—the cure will be immediate.

**Six Talismans for Healing**
On each talisman, depict the true form of the Jade Maiden standing upright. When treating illness, do not use the seal at the head.

**Talisman Incantation**
By the decree of the Nine Heavens, the talisman of the sun, moon, and stars descends. To the left, command the Azure Dragon; to the right, command the White Tiger; ahead, command the Vermilion Bird; behind, command the Dark Warrior. Four hundred thousand spirits—ward off all inauspicious omens. Wherever the talisman arrives, perpetual harmony and uprightness prevail, and all malevolent spirits vanish into the earth. **Urgent, urgent—by the statutes and commands!**

**Method for Casting Talismans at the Spirit’s Seat**
If a person of meager fortune fails to summon the spirits, or if the response is sluggish, proceed thus: inscribe the talisman of the current ten-day period, recite the incantation, and cast it before the spirit’s seat—the spirit will arrive swiftly.
For example, in the *Jiazi* ten-day period, inscribe the *Mao* talisman; follow this pattern for others.
**Incantation:** *"Reverently invoke the *Zi* and *Mao* spirits of the *Jiazi* ten-day period. Proceed to such-and-such place to attend to matters and save the afflicted. Act with haste—do not disobey."*
After reciting the incantation, cast the talisman before the seat of the *Dingmao* spirit and halt. Even across a thousand *li*, the response will be immediate. Inquire about matters of fortune or misfortune, and the spirits will reveal them.
To bind ghosts and spirits, simply press the "ghost’s eye" between your fingers—the ghost will perish at once. If a malevolent person approaches, write their name, swallow it, and press the "eye"—they will come of their own accord.

**Talisman for Casting the Six Ding Spirits at Their Seats**
When inscribing talismans, visualize the Jade Maiden as you begin. To sever copper or steel, first mark twenty-eight points, symbolizing the twenty-eight constellations. Recite the star incantation four times, symbolizing the four seasons, and eight times, symbolizing the eight solar terms. Each point must be made in a single stroke—do not retrace.
Whoever obtains this talisman will command the generals of the Three and Five, the *Liushi* divine generals, and the celestial enforcers. They will refuse even a thousand gold pieces, for it is a treasure beyond price. **Guard it well—it is the most potent of all methods.**

**Talisman for Delivering the Departed from the Underworld**
This talisman guides the nine generations of ancestors and the seven generations of forebears into the netherworld, as well as all departed souls. First, inscribe three talismanic strokes, then address the Jade Maiden: *"I have lost my ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears—where have they gone? Or: I have lost so-and-so—since their passing, I know not where they dwell."*
The spirit bearing this talisman will descend to the depths of hell and the dark peaks, summoning the officials to inquire. *"Release my departed so-and-so at once."* **Swiftly, swiftly!**
Upon speaking, burn the talisman—the departed will manifest.

For all the above talismans, inscribe them in red. If cinnabar is unavailable, use standard ink, then seal them with the appropriate stamp. For any undertaking, inscribe a talisman, write the name of the Jade Maiden of the current ten-day period on either side, and sincerely petition the matter at hand. After a grand ritual offering, there is no need to erect an altar each time—simply present incense, tea, wine, and fruit, burn incense, and make your plea with utmost devotion. The Jade Maiden will naturally appear in her true form. The talisman need not be burned—it will depart of its own accord. Its numinous power is boundless. Whoever obtains this method must treasure it as their greatest possession.

Revere it, and your nine clans will receive blessings—fortune, emolument, and glory will flourish, and you may ascend to immortality and attain the Dao. Disdain it, and your six relations will suffer calamity—disaster will strike, and you may sink into the dark realms as a ghost. **How can one not be cautious?** Focus your mind unwaveringly, and banish all distractions. If in dreams your form travels afar, or if a woman appears seated beside you, it is the Jade Maiden descending. From then on, your methods will gradually align with your will. If the six spirits frequent your presence over time, manifesting as shadows or forms, or communicating through whispers or visions, it is a sign that your karmic affinity with this method has ripened. There is no need for elaborate practice—simply petition with sincerity, and the response will be immediate.

Whoever attains this method has, in truth, borne the name of an immortal in past lives, and thus has come to possess this Way in the present. From the celestial palaces of the Jade Emperor above to the netherworld courts below, all undertakings will be met with resonance. **This is not to be transmitted for ten thousand gold pieces.** As the ancients said: *"Better to give a thousand gold than to reveal the secrets of the Six Jia’s yin methods."*

**The True Scripture of the Six Yin Caverns of the Mysterious and Transformative Hidden Jia, Volume the Lower—Concluded.**
