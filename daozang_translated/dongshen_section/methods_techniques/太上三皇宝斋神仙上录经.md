**The Three Sovereigns’ Register of Divine Immortal Prayers and Inner Spirit Treasures**

The Yellow Emperor said: All scholars who wholeheartedly aspire to the Dao, seeking life through diligent practice, enduring the great stillness of fasting, yearning for divine immortality, and beseeching the numinous from dawn to dusk without shunning hunger or cold—those who rescue and protect the myriad people, making this their karmic cause—shall have blessings flow through seven generations, escape great calamities, transcend water and fire, and enjoy peace in body and wholeness in form.

This is the supreme method of the profoundest depths, enabling one to attain divine immortality. Through study, one perfects it, and virtue/power renews daily.

The Yellow Emperor said: The Three Sovereigns are the spirits of the primordial womb. They are the secret scriptures of the Supreme Sovereign. Those who possess them become divine immortals; those who behold them extend their years; those who chant them ascend to meet the August Lords, while the ten directions’ celestial hosts all come to witness.

Their texts are most wondrous, their rank most exalted. They empower one to enter and exit water and fire, transform the hidden and obscure, govern the records of the Three Offices, and determine life in an instant. Diligence is paramount—only then will one’s name be inscribed among the immortals. Their arts are utterly authentic, not merely the scriptures alone.

The Yellow Emperor said: Those who possess this book must fast with devotion, burn incense and recite prayers, bathe in cloud and water, offer smoke to the Upper Prime, and observe the fast for three periods of nine days. With the Eight Emperor Spirit Texts, they knock their hearts and recite invocations, so that their prayers ascend to the Three Heavens. Seven generations of sins are erased, dark trials are wholly absolved, suffering is transcended, transgressions are excised, and truth is attained. Through diligent cultivation, one ascends to meet the August Lords.

The Yellow Emperor said: In the primordial era, there were the gods of the Three Sovereigns, with the Eight Emperors governing in succession, all assisted by perfected beings. Evil did not arise, nor did disasters occur—this is not what the world transmits. In the time of Fuxi and Nüwa, their reigns each lasted thirteen thousand years. Later, the Supreme Heaven bestowed upon them the Eight Emperors’ sacred scriptures and wondrous arts, the Dao of long life and eternal transformation, the Seven Records of Assisting the Sage, and the Three Marvels of Governing the World—this is that very book.

Moreover, one writes the Three Sovereigns’ texts on blue silk, making banners three feet in length, inscribed in vermilion. These are hung from ten-foot bamboo poles in the courtyard. Alternatively, one may invite the August Texts upon a table, facing north as the seat. Burn incense, make vows, and knock the teeth twenty-four times in succession, then pray:

*"Fragrant smoke and jade maidens, ascend to report to the August Lords. This humble one, [name], fasts in purity, free from dust, awaiting the five spiritual penetrations. May my supreme vow be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and ascent to the Three Heavens achieved."*

When finished, light the lamps and perform the Daoist walk, with prayers and vows following this method. All disasters, misfortunes, and harms shall be entirely dispelled; those on the brink of death from illness shall be reborn.

This fasting method requires vigilance and diligence with the lamps. One eats once at midday, and again at the time of *shengqi* (living qi) at night, after burning incense and presenting vows. This is the regimen for eating and resting at each interval. However, one must not violate the fast’s prohibitions with impurity, nor allow those lacking focus to profane its strictures. The procedures and regulations follow the above method.

**Method for Compounding Upper Prime Incense Beads**

Take three *jin* of aloeswood, one *jin* of frankincense, nine *liang* of *qingmu* (blue wood), five *liang* of clove, three *liang* of *xuanshen* (figwort root), six *liang* of *quetail* (sparrow’s head), three *liang* of *zhanxiang* (benzoin), two *liang* of *baizhi* (angelica root), four *liang* of true sandalwood, three *liang* of mugwort incense, four *liang* of styrax resin, and three *liang* of *mulan* (magnolia). In all, twelve ingredients, each to be pounded separately and sifted through silk. Then add ten *liang* of dried jujubes and pound together thirty thousand times. Place in a white vessel, seal tightly, and steam the incense for one day. When done, mix with honey, pound again, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Thread them with green cord, dry in the sun, and these become the **Incense Beads of the Three Sovereigns’ True Prime**. Burning them will ascend through the Nine Heavens, where perfected beings and jade maidens will sing amidst the void.

Further, add half a *jin* of realgar and four *liang* of musk, pound together, and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill every nineteen days. Regular consumption sharpens the spirit without decline, sweetens the breath, and attracts perfected beings and numinous forces, summoning jade maidens while repelling all illnesses, ailments, evil ghosts, inauspicious omens, and malevolent spirits, which will flee and submit from afar.

The Yellow Emperor said: The **Fasting Method of the August Scriptures** is most true and precious, not transmitted in the mundane world. Those seeking immortality or petitioning for the myriad people’s blessings, delivering them from distress, disasters, and harms, must first perform the **Great Fasting Method of the Eight Emperors** to absolve the sins of seven generations of parents and oneself. After three years, one may inscribe one’s immortal name and attain the Dao of deathlessness. If one wishes to summon the hundred spirits, one must first accumulate fasting merits until resonance occurs naturally—only then may they be invoked. At that time, all will be clearly understood in the heart.

The Yellow Emperor said: If the myriad people suffer from urgent illnesses, dire calamities, or deep-rooted sins beyond salvation, they should petition the Three Sovereigns and perform the **Precious Fasting Method** to redeem themselves. Burn incense and light three, five, seven, nine, or thirty-six lamps, symbolizing the number of the Thirty-Six Heavens. After forty or a hundred days, all sins will be erased. The **Directors of Destiny** and **Scribes of Records** will then inscribe one’s immortal name, bestowing boundless great fortune. Bright lamps illuminate the spirits; rising smoke directs the *qi*. The Supreme Perfected delight in divine music, and the Three Sovereigns gather in feast. The petitioner attains transcendence, and blessings flow for ten thousand generations. Performing this ritual twenty-one times in a year constitutes the **Great Crossing**.

The Yellow Emperor said: To bring blessings to the myriad people and deliver them from urgent calamities and disasters, the petitioner should fast for three, five, seven, or nine days—whatever feels appropriate. Bathe in the **Mysterious Cloud Water**, burn the **August Supreme Incense**, and light the **Mysterious Fluid Candles**—three, five, seven, or nine lamps, as one wishes. Space them six *chi* apart, ensuring the candle flames do not spread too widely. Place one incense burner and one oil lamp, and do not allow anyone to pass between them. If passage is necessary, set up a **Gate of Concentration**. Constantly tend the lamps to keep the incense smoke unbroken. At midday and sunset, bow again, burn incense, and pray as one wishes. This is the **Inner Rite of the Three-Five Great Fast**.

**Method for Compounding Mysterious Unction**
Take one *hu* of sesame paste, one *jin* of true sandalwood, one *jin* of *qingmu* (blue wood), one *liang* of *xuanshen* (figwort root), and three *liang* of incense beads. Pound them, place in the paste, seal tightly, and simmer over low heat for half a day to complete.

**Method for Compounding Double-Heaven Water**
Take three *hu* of water, four *liang* of *qingmu* (blue wood), seven *liang* of true sandalwood, and two *liang* of *xuanshen* (figwort root). Combine and boil until one bubbling. When done, let it settle and cool to a suitable temperature for bathing. This is the **Mysterious Water of the Heavenly Perfected and Jade Maidens**, called the **Divine Elixir for Refining the Embryonic Spirit**. Both this method and the incense beads derive from the **Upper Record of the Precious Fast**, unseen by worldly people.

If one wishes to perceive subtle resonances and know others’ fortunes and misfortunes, one should ingest the **Talismans of the Three Sovereigns’ Hidden Heaven**. This will naturally establish resonance with the divine, allowing one to foresee the mysterious gatherings of the future.

**Offering Rites**
After completing the nighttime Daoist walk, spread mats and arrange seats according to the positions of the Three Sovereigns. The **Heavenly Sovereign**’s seat is black, facing north; the **Earthly Sovereign**’s seat is white, facing southwest; the **Human Sovereign**’s seat is blue-green, facing northeast. Set out three large trays, three cups of wine, dried meat made from kelp, southern-style glutinous rice dumplings, seasonal fruits, three *dou* of wine, and plain dried meat.

First, face north and recite the incantation:
*"Fragrant smoke, jade maidens, ascend to report to the August Lords. I, [Name], perform this fast and Daoist walk, completing the eighteen hours. Now I burn incense and present offerings, bowing to invoke the Three Sovereigns and True Lords. May you descend with your numinous essence and enter my body, so that my petition may be presented before the Three Sovereigns’ altar."*

Next, pour wine and bow three times, kneeling to say:
*"Disciple of the Cavernous Dao, [Name], humbly petitions on behalf of [Recipient’s Name] to invoke the Heavenly Sovereign, Overseer of the Grand Unity; the Earthly Sovereign, Lord of the True Unity; and the Human Sovereign, Governor of the Three Unities. May they descend to this seat and witness my sincere heart."*

Meditate on the deities for a long while, then kneel and say:
*"Petitioner [Name] respectfully addresses the Three Sovereigns and True Lords. Though I am of humble and ordinary capacity, I have presumptuously received the precious scriptures of the Three Sovereigns, cultivating them inwardly and teaching them outwardly. Now, [Recipient’s Name] has submitted a petition and request. I reverently proclaim it again."*

Read the petition aloud.

*"Having received the decree, I, along with [Number] fellow practitioners, perform the Three Sovereigns’ fast for three days and nights, completing the eighteen hours of the Daoist walk. With utmost sincerity, we humbly invoke your presence. The rites are now complete. We present simple offerings of wine and vegetables, humbly beseeching the August Sovereigns to bestow your compassionate gaze, absolve our deep transgressions and grave faults, resolve karmic entanglements, erase the black records, extend our life spans, heal all illnesses, grant eternal well-being, multiply blessings ten thousandfold, encourage virtuous deeds, bring harmony to families and nations, and ensure universal good fortune."*

With utmost reverence, we present this petition, humbly beseeching your compassionate assent.

*Bow three times again.*

Then, as our hearts dictate, we make further entreaties, saying:
*"The August Sovereigns, in your exalted majesty, have deigned to descend and grace this humble and impure place. Now that the rites of invocation are complete, we dare not delay your departure. With each breath, we reverently send you ascending, returning to your divine seats. We kowtow in farewell."*

*Bow twice again, then burn incense in the censer, saying:*
*"Maidens of the fragrant smoke, as the true spirits descend and bestow their compassionate blessings, may they ascend to the celestial palaces. Let the incense smoke disperse and harmonize with the Dao/Way."*

The rites now concluded, we bow and withdraw.

*The Scripture of the Most High Three Sovereigns’ Precious Fast and the Celestial Register of Divine Immortals ends here.*
