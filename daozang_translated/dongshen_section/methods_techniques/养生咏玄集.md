**Title:** *Yangsheng Yongxuan Ji* (*Chanting the Mysteries: A Collection on Nurturing Life*). Author unknown. One fascicle. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, Methods category.

**Preface to *Yangsheng Yongxuan Ji***
To "chant the mysteries" is to intone the profound depths of the unseen. By delving into the obscure to grasp principle and seeking truth in the indistinct, one gathers the essence of all wonders and distills the essential convergence of the myriad scriptures. The words are direct yet their meaning upright, the Dao entering the realm of profound mystery; the purport seems distant yet its intent is luminous, its influence preserving the legacy of the highest ancestors. It guides the restless striving of dragon and tiger toward unity, revealing the subtle mysteries of the Dark Female, free from all grasping. It directly points to the ultimate return, establishing wondrous efficacy. It rightly expounds the teachings of opening and closing, clarifying the fundamental distinctions between departure and approach. Encompassing the revolving mystery, it ascends and descends in boundless vastness. Thus, the inferior scholar claps in delight, while the superior scholar diligently practices, perfecting the integrity of spirit and qi to ultimately dissolve the illusory reflections of root and dust. Truly, how heavy is the pearl and jade, how light the nature and life! Would one not exhaustively unravel the mystery of stilling movement and calming the breath, only to indulge the fleeting passage of radiant light and the departure of the soul? How deeply lamentable!

These chants of the mystery are indeed the essential methods for attaining longevity and transcending the world. Such as the sacred talismans of the Mysterious Origin Emperor, forever concealed within the pillow; the divine formulas of the Prince of Huainan, secretly stored behind the elbow. These are the most revered and treasured words of the highest sages. Should a scholar encounter them, they must guard and cherish them with utmost secrecy and care.

**Yangsheng Yongxuan Ji**

**Rong and Wei Qi**
The two qi complete each other, and the Dao begins to arise.
Form and appearance take shape, yet none exists solely from one qi alone.
Only when *rong* and *wei* are harmonized does life persist.
Thus it is said: the two qi complete each other to give birth—this is the Dao.
The Dao is life.
As Laozi said: the Dao cannot be seen, so it is revealed through life.
Life cannot be eternal, so the Dao is employed to preserve it.
Intermingled, they flow from a single source.
This is the fusion of the two qi—harmonious qi dwelling together in one origin, for they perpetually generate.
Yin and yang stimulate and depend on each other.
Receiving the two qi, form and substance take shape; containing the two qi, life and growth are established. All this arises from the mutual stimulation of yin and yang, which nourishes nature and life.
Without harmony and gentleness, there is conflict.
If the two qi contend and fail to harmonize, they stir disorder in the five viscera and extinguish life.
Thus the *Classic* states: "When yin hesitates at yang, the lines wage war."
Hence, there is no purely yang man or purely yin woman.
Heaven is wholly yang yet bears yin dew; earth is wholly yin yet embraces yang essence.
Thus, heaven and earth rely on yin and yang to transform and generate the myriad things.
The *Book of Changes* says: "Qian is male, Kun is female." Therefore, human relations fully emulate the patterns of heaven and earth.

**Rong Qi**
Rong qi does not arise in isolation,
Rong qi is clear yang.
The *Neiguan Jing* states: "Qi that is clear and swift is called *rong*."
Within the human body, it cannot stand alone, hence it does not arise in isolation.
Clear yang, empty and subtle, depends on yin for its existence.
Yin qi gathers, and yang rests upon it; yang qi abides, and yin relies on it.
Thus it is said: yang depends on yin for its existence, for they complete each other.
From this, the first signs of the embryo take form.
When the two qi interact, the fetus begins to take shape.
Upon leaving the womb, life begins with the inception of rong qi.
Refining it to return to the origin follows a distinct path.
Amid the two qi, one refines and returns to the original source of pure, unified, and serene qi. By separately cultivating and removing impurities, one achieves the fullness of yang, and rong unites with the Dao in truth.

**Wei Qi**
Wei qi originally arises from yang qi.
Wei is turbid.
The *Neiguan Jing* states: "Qi that is turbid and slow is called *wei*."
It fundamentally arises from the interaction of primordial qi, which gives rise to the physical body. Once the body exists, the nature of wei qi becomes evident, thus wei derives from rong.
The colored body takes shape within the womb.
Once form and substance emerge, they receive the influence of the two qi and dwell within the womb.
Silently mirroring heaven and earth, it arranges the palaces.
The human body subtly reflects the pattern of heaven and earth.
Thus the *Neiguan Jing* says: "The eyes are the sun and moon, the hair is the stars, the eyebrows are the canopy, the head is Kunlun. The palaces are arrayed, and the spirit is settled."
This is what is meant.
From this, it condenses and refines with exquisite precision.

From this, essence and blood congeal and refine to form substance, so finely wrought as to be measurable, thus fulfilling their function.

Now, human *wei* qi possesses two designations:
First, essence and blood congeal and refine to form substance.
Second, it flows in unison with *rong* qi, circulating to sustain life.

Know then that the human body serves as the ground for cultivating the true, deserving its title as the most numinous of beings.
How could one fail to cherish it, grow indolent, and seek what flees?

This *wei* qi also mirrors the Three Powers:
First, congealing and refining to form substance, it images Earth;
Second, where *rong* and *wei* unite, the daily harmonizing qi images Man;
Third, the true essence of life resides in the Upper Cinnabar Field, the palace of pure yang, imaging Heaven.
Receiving these three qi to sustain life, the Dao naturally returns to it, for the body embodies the Three Powers and treads the Way.

**Hun and Po**
Thus, when the two qi contain harmony, life takes root.
*Hun* is the true essence of yang;
*Po* is the true essence of yin.
These two essences dwell in the Mud-Pill Palace, bearing the two qi without separation, and the spirit abides within them—thus life takes root.

Laozi said: "The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, achieving harmony through the Dao."
At first, they are called *hun* and *po*, responding to the true numen.

Zichan said: "At birth, one is called *po*; once alive, one is called *hun*."
Thus, the arising of the two qi is none other than *hun* and *po* responding to the true numen.
Yet in life, with its myriad transformations and changes, there is birth and death—none transcend the Three Clarities, drifting through the various destinies. The pivot of gain and loss lies precisely here.

In heaven, the sun and moon fully manifest their images:
The sun and moon are the *hun* and *po* of heaven and earth.
Thus, *hun* is the sun, governing the day, the true essence of heaven;
*Po* is the moon, governing the night, the true essence of earth.
Know then that brightness and darkness share a single source, circulating and communicating.
Thus, the *hun* and *po* of humans fully manifest their images in the sun and moon.

The Prince of Huainan said: "The qi of heaven forms *hun*; the qi of earth forms *po*."
The *Neijing of the Five Viscera* also states: "The father’s essence becomes *hun*; the mother’s essence becomes *po*."
This principle is manifestly clear.

**The Myriad Transformations All Arise from Guarding the One**
The myriad transformations are but the heart’s extinguishing, driving *hun* and *po* to manifest in life.
Thus, the sages established countless scriptures and teachings to instruct the multitudes, revealing the method of guarding the One to still all delusions.

**Hun**
The yang essence of *hun* is called "spirit-metal."
*Hun* is the true essence of yang.
Thus, yang essence is the metal of spirit, and the sages made it the dharma-body, linking and transmitting it to communicate with the true.

Master Han said: "Without utmost essence, one cannot transform into utmost spirit."
Baopuzi said: "Laozi is the *hun* of heaven, conceived by the essence of the sun, transforming into a wondrous body—thus manifesting the essence of utmost yang."

**Resonance and Hidden Signs Operate in the Heart**
When the heart moves, qi turns—hence it is called "hidden signs," clarifying resonance.
If one attains perfect penetration by stilling all delusions,
qi unites with spirit, and transformation arises.

**The Numinous Light Shines, Shedding All Yin**
Once true essence is complete and numinous union achieved, one roams freely in the unending light, shedding the golden yin substance.
Thus, the sages received and mastered it to communicate with numinous transformation.

**Po**
The yin qi surges and blends, responding to yang.
When circumstances stir the heart, resonance arises.
When the two come together, harmony flows like nectar.

**Pursuing the Mysterious Here Is Not True Application**
Pursuing the mysterious through reckless indulgence causes the two qi to diverge—this is not the method of true application, but a violation of the Dao’s true principle.

**Hun Does Not Soar, Po Does Not Hinder**
When *hun* does not soar and *po* does not hinder, they respond to the heart’s function.
If *hun* does not fly, *po* does not respond—
for the heart governs departure and abiding, the root of life and death.
The principle of cultivating life is found nowhere else.

**Valley Spirit**
The Sage Ancestor at Hangu Pass revealed the Valley Spirit.

At Hangu Pass, the Sage Ancestor expounded the *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand words to Yin Xi, the Pass Keeper, establishing principles through images and revealing the Valley Spirit. He stripped away superficial distortions to illuminate its profound mysteries. Its meaning runs deep and ever-renews through the ages. How could its subtleties ever be exhausted? Even with great clarity, none can fathom its vast source—hence it is called "deep and ever-renewing." This speaks of the sutra’s profound obscurity.

If you seek it within yourself,
casting aside words to grasp the principle and upholding the method of practice within—this is not found beyond the Valley.
Then you are one enlightened in this very life.
Such realization transcends distinctions of superiority, inferiority, or existence and nonexistence. If one is truly perceptive, enlightenment may dawn in a single lifetime, for the alchemy of fruition belongs to all beings.

**Why Does the Valley Conceal Such Marvelous Spirit?**
The Valley is the sign of the two qi’s nurturing transformation.
All depends on the Valley’s embrace of true essence.
True essence is the essence of the two qi.
It does not reside in the Mud Pill Palace—this is why the Valley conceals such marvelous spirit.
If essence scatters, spirit departs.

Only when they find their proper interdependence,
when spirit and qi rely upon each other, inseparable and undissipated,
does their union give rise to sound.
When they unite and resonate with the marvelous spirit, life becomes manifest—then words arise.

**Spirit**
Profoundly still, it comes without reliance.
In utter tranquility, before it inhabits the four great elements, spirit roams the Supreme Ultimate, unattached. Only when it descends into the body does the marvelous become evident, life take root, and the foundational form of the Dao mirror heaven and earth.
Through countless lifetimes, in action and repose, it responds with perfect clarity.

Laozi said: "Invisible when seen, inaudible when heard, intangible when grasped."
The *Book of Changes* states: "That which cannot be fathomed in yin and yang is called spirit."
Thus we know it cannot be measured by thought—how could words ever fully express it?

**Passing Through the Mysterious Valley, the Multitude of Spirits Return**
Having passed through the Mysterious Valley,
the eyes perceive form, the ears hear sound,
the nose detects fragrance, the tongue distinguishes taste,
the mind cherishes desires, the body senses cold and heat—
its transformations are manifold, hence it is said "the multitude of spirits return."

**Now You Recognize the Path of Returning to the Origin**
The Way of returning to the origin,
the method of extinguishing the heart and embracing the One,
lies in uniting practice with the Dao—not through excessive effort.
It does not depend on traversing distant paths.
Its essence is not remote or subtle;
both substance and function are illuminated, merging with the Dao.

**Returning to the Origin**
When qi wanes and form withers, spirit diminishes.

**Human Decline and the Return to the Origin**
Human decline and aging arise from the stains of desires, leading to injury and ruin, and thus to frequent setbacks. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "As fire arises from wood, it returns to burn the wood to ash." The *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence* also says: "The heart is born of things." This is what is meant. Returning to the origin is the truest path. When qi is complete and spirit is whole, the Dao may be perfected. The Perfected One of Great White Mountain said: "The old revert to youth, the strong return to infancy." This clarifies the meaning of returning to the origin and reverting to the primordial.

**Mending Faults and Recognizing the Great Peril**
Only when the work of mending faults is accomplished does one gradually align with the Dao. Mending faults means repairing the past errors of indulgence and dissipation. When this work is complete, one aligns with the path of returning to the origin. To "recognize anew" is to reaffirm the return to the origin. There are two aspects to returning to the origin: first, mending faults, which is seeking the fullness of qi to return to the true; second, "recognizing anew," for the origin is the return to the primordial source. Laozi said: "My great affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would I have?" Thus, Laozi did not regard preserving the body as the ultimate goal.

**The Union of Spirit and Qi**
Spirit and qi must not part, for they depend on each other. Spirit without qi is like a fish separated from its spring; qi without spirit is like a lamp without flame—they cannot be separated. This is made clear to dispel the doubts of the world. When spirit unites with qi, it transforms into formlessness. The principle of being and non-being is not to be clung to rigidly. If this is deeply understood, scholars’ doubts will fade, for people differ in wisdom and clarity, some profound, some shallow.

**The Distinction Between the Sage and the Common**
The sage does not see external forms, does not hear external sounds, does not contemplate external matters—spirit congeals and qi unites. The common person, by contrast, takes ruin as their heart and exhausts spirit through laborious thought. Thus, the sage practices the union of spirit and qi. Without severing the furnace of spirit, how could one know this? If alignment is not yet achieved, spirit and qi will not unite. It is like a cat hunting a mouse: like responds to like, and qi seeks its kind. From this, one may form the embryo and nurture the infant, transform the foul substance of the body, reverse aging and restore youth, refine the turbid and solidified form. Some ignite fire to burn the body, some transmute into golden bones, some shed impurities and stagnation, some condense true suchness. Entering the wondrous gate of non-duality, one exhausts the infinite principle. Only when spirit and qi unite do they produce responsive function. Their destination, whether profound or shallow, determines the mastery of the transformative Dao.

**Embracing the Profound and Holding to the One**
The essential practice is embracing the profound and holding to the One—spirit and qi embracing, merging into oneness. Laozi said: "Hold to the One as the model for all under heaven." And again: "The adept holds without losing, calculates without need of counting rods." Zhuangzi also said: "When one is attuned to the One, all matters are complete." Without comprehending the true primordial Dao, how can there be communication?

**The Empty Mind Sees Truth**
Only when the mind-ground is empty can truth be seen. Emptiness means emptying the heart. Thus, Laozi’s *Thirteen* and the *Scripture of Emptiness* expound upon the thirteen types of those born into the world, as revealed in the *Five Thousand Characters*. These thirteen all return to emptiness as the highest good. When the mind-ground is empty, one seeks to embrace the true One. Truly, the functions of the myriad things are not the same. Scholars follow many paths, and profound teachings vary. Thus, the Dao of emptiness and holding to the One differs from the uses of the myriad things.

**Embryonic Breathing**
When the harmonious Dao is mastered, wholeness is attained. Harmony arises from the blending of the two qi, where constructive and protective energies converge. If one applies this to the convergence of constructive and protective qi, one aligns with the most profound principle, attaining the meeting point of life’s Dao. This is called the abstruse principle of embryonic breathing. To grasp the principle of profound mystery is to clarify the method of true abiding. How can one who dwells in the womb like a newborn child attain this? Without the hundred grains, how could life arise? Carefully examine the practice—its method is natural. Understanding the Dao of the newborn child reveals the mechanism of embryonic breathing. Naturally, one comprehends spirit’s congealment and the cessation of thoughts. The sage is born of this and relies on it to achieve completion. Without grasping its essential pivot, the great affliction cannot be removed. The path of return reaches this point where no method can be spoken, yet the source of returning aligns with its application in due time. Applying it in practice, there is no error.

Master Qizhen said: "When my qi is inwardly sealed, my body enjoys long peace." The method of embryonic breathing is entirely the natural Dao. One safeguards the true breath, continuous and subtle, coming and going imperceptibly, neither allowing stillness nor restlessness to disturb, seeking only tranquility. Practicing day and night without interruption, as days pass and months turn, the true person does not leave the chamber. When the embryo is fully formed, the Dao is perfected. Laozi said: "Subtle and continuous, it is used without exhaustion." This principle, when clearly understood, severs all distractions, establishing the ultimate and giving rise to luminous wisdom. When one reaches the state of stability, the water of stability is born, irrigating the five viscera and generating radiant light. This is called true water, not the turbid fluids of saliva. This is the essential method for preserving form and abiding in the world. The *Inscription of the Three Abidings* states: "If the heart abides, qi abides; if qi abides, form abides. When all three abide, my life is in my hands, not in heaven’s."

**Nature**
Water’s nature is humble and yielding; fire’s nature is strong and ascending. Water and fire each belong to nature, illustrating the principle of their mutual generation to clarify the natural Dao of spirit and qi. Water descends to the lowly, fire rises to the heights—each corresponds to its nature. Thus, qi can steam upward, and fluids can moisten downward. The two interact and respond to each other: qi ascends to generate fluids, fluids descend to generate qi. Nurturing the body, they transform through mutual influence.

Thus, their names correspond precisely, not by human coercion. Their mutual interaction and resonance share a common nature—this interaction, where water and fire converge to produce resonance, mirrors external phenomena. Consider water and fire: when fire heats a cauldron, water vapor arises, revealing the resonance of the great Dao as entirely natural. Let no divergent paths obscure the principle that endures of itself.

Since the fundamental nature of the Dao is self-so, nothing is sought from without. Heaven covers and earth bears; male begets and female conceives; ruler and minister, father and child—all follow the natural reckoning. Not belonging to disparate paths or distinct kinds, yet able to harmonize thus, the Way of the Returned Elixir becomes manifest! The principle of the original source is illuminated!

**Dragon and Tiger**
When dragon and tiger share a source in restless strife,
The dragon, elusive and ever-changing, neither fixed in being nor non-being, mirrors the marvel of spirit. The tiger, fierce in nature and unyielding in strength, in turn embodies the essence of qi. The sage blends spirit and qi into one, thus mastering the mechanism of their subjugation. The common folk, however, conduct them separately within and without, breeding the ceaseless agitation that sets dragon soaring and tiger fleeing, no longer bound to one another.

Only when gathered to excess do they scatter.
Once form takes shape, spirit and qi are preserved in full—yet allured by desires, they decline into frailty and decay. When original qi is exhausted, spirit has nowhere to lodge, leading to death. Thus it is said: when gathered to excess, they scatter.

First, the tiger must be restrained as the pivotal mechanism;
To tame the dragon, first restrain the tiger.

Thus the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* states: "To capture and control lies in qi." For it is by preserving qi in its entirety that its function is made manifest. Thereby the dragon lies concealed, and both hold fast. When the tiger is subdued and the dragon harbors, both rely on themselves and return to the Dao of True Unity.

The *Song of the Great Emperor Lao* says:
*"When the tiger is subdued, the dragon too harbors;
First tame the dragon, then subdue the tiger.
Once the River Chariot’s work is complete,
No need for dikes or barriers to resist."*

This reveals the function of capture.

**Refining yang to dissolve yin**
*"When yang is refined, yin dissolves—this shifts the world;
Refining yang consumes the yin substance."*

The method of refining yang to dissolve yin was transmitted by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to the Yellow Emperor as the Three-One Oral Formula—this is its Dao. If spirit and qi merge, yang refines itself and yin dissolves of its own accord, all according to natural principle. Is it not the interplay of yin and yang that makes it so?

The *Yellow Court Classic* states: *"The primordial One refines the hun and po."* Its principle is profoundly abstruse; few grasp its depth, hence it is said to be rare in the world.

*"The numinous text and wondrous formula are best followed faithfully."*
The *Numinous Text* refers to the *Golden Tablet*; the *Wondrous Formula* is the Three-One Method. These all originate from the secret treasury, ascending into the Mysterious Capital—unless one is a perfected person, this Dao is not transmitted.

The transformative principle of refining yang to dissolve yin fundamentally communicates through the mechanism of emptiness and non-being. How could ordinary people attain it?

*"Yang, by nature restless and hard to restrain—"*
Yet to restrain it is not one-sided; the Dao may be fully realized without being fettered or isolated to achieve its wondrous function.

The *Mysterious Rigidity* states: *"If a person retains even a fraction of yang, they do not die; if they retain even a fraction of yin, they do not become immortal."*

**Recognize the supreme mechanism of the numinous origin**
The numinous origin possesses a supreme mechanism, which is the pivotal key to restraining restlessness. The Perfected Master of Grand White says: *"When the mysterious mechanism arrives, the body endures; when it departs, the body perishes."*

**Upper Cinnabar Field**
*"Palace gates layered upon layered, named the Jade Capital—"*
The *Jade Capital* refers to the Muddy Pellet Palace. The Upper Cinnabar Field contains nine interconnected palace gates, hence it is said that *"palace gates layered upon layered."*

*"Where the Reverted Elixir is accomplished—the Yang Crucible."*
The *Reverted Elixir* is true essence. The Upper Cinnabar Field is the palace of pure yang, the sole repository of the Reverted Elixir—all people possess it, hence it is called *"where the Reverted Elixir is accomplished—the Yang Crucible."*

*"The divine passage through the spine serves as the thoroughfare—"*
This palace has two channels flanking the spine, descending to the Cinnabar Field and Sea of Qi, through which true essence flows, transforming and harmonizing qi to respond to leakage.

*"Below, it corresponds to the Gate of Origin—no cause for concern."*
The *Gate of Origin* is the Lower Cinnabar Field, the gateway for the leakage of essence and qi. When a person engages in yin-yang intercourse, true essence descends to this gate, where harmonized qi coalesces into congealed essence to serve the spirit’s function. This gate is the mouth of a hundred convergences, connecting to all the viscera, the four limbs, sinews, and vessels—like the pores of lotus roots, it is the site of qi transformation, hence it is called the *Gate of Origin*. If the upper corresponds to the lower, the Daoist need not be concerned.

**Middle Cinnabar Field**

At the *jian-shen* command, it corresponds to the Middle Field—
*Jian-shen* refers to the Zhongyuan Festival in the seventh month, which also aligns with the human Middle Cinnabar Field. This governs the three burners: heart, lungs, and liver. The *three burners* are the heart, lungs, and liver, the palace of respiration. As this is under the jurisdiction of the Middle Cinnabar Field, it is called the *Palace of Life*. Here, fluids descend to moisten and reach their destination.

Within stands the *Spirit Terrace*, where the true sovereign abides—
The *Spirit Terrace* is one of the five viscera, the heart. The true spirit anchors here as its palace, hence it is said to house the true sovereign. Through cultivation, the present is realized. Attaining lightness and peace, if one understands the movement and function of the true spirit, then cultivation manifests in the present, and with lightness and peace, all worries and afflictions vanish forever.

**Lower Cinnabar Field**
Balanced harmony nurtures the Lower Cinnabar Field—
The *Lower Cinnabar Field* is the Sea of Qi, three inches below the navel. *Balanced harmony* refers to the flourishing of unified qi, where constructive and defensive qi merge, hence the name *harmonized qi*. This qi circulates through the five viscera and four limbs, ever gathering in the Lower Cinnabar Field, thus called the *Sea of Qi*. Yet when the heart stirs with action, yielding to lustful desires, true essence from the Upper Cinnabar Field descends to the Lower Cinnabar Field, transforming harmonized qi. Once this qi is transformed, it is then depleted—how could the Dao remain obscure?

When the two qi converge, all responds in resonance—
This speaks of the mutual arousal of male and female passions, leading to the act of cloud and rain. All arises from natural resonance, even unto the formation of conception. As true primordial essence undergoes transformation, those who cultivate life must guard it with care, seeking the method of restraint. Thus, the *Tai Bai True Scripture* states: *"Retaining essence within the body gives life to the body; releasing essence into another gives life to another."* When this primordial qi merges with that primordial qi, and the other takes form, this one suffers loss—hence the utmost caution is required.

Examine closely the convergence of heaven and earth—
The yin and yang qi of heaven and earth interact, generating transformation. Indeed, the principle of yin-yang’s cyclical movement is self-evident, as when qi rises to steam the One into rain, and rain descends to moisten, giving rise to the myriad things. Yet by closely observing the convergence of heaven and earth, the revolutions of sun and moon, one clarifies the model and comprehends the principle of impartiality.

**Profound Mystery**
The Upper Mystery subtly communes with the Lower Mystery—

The Upper Mystery is the gate; the Lower Mystery, the barrier. If the Upper Mystery does not cease, then the lower desires are difficult to eliminate—thus it is said that upper and lower subtly commune.

Movement and stillness have ever been of one nature. In motion and rest, above and below respond, their qi interflowing—hence the illumination of the Profound Mystery, discussed here in tandem with the mind’s method. As when the dragon’s chant summons clouds, or the tiger’s roar stirs wind, all follow their kind and find their place. Thus the Upper and Lower Mysteries, in application, are equal to the mind’s method, mutually aiding and assisting—all is of one principle.

Diminish and nurture the Upper Mystery to bring about its dissolution. Through single-minded focus, gradually seek this dissolution. Laozi said: “A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot; a nine-tiered terrace rises from heaped earth.” Thus the process of diminution and nurture follows the same pattern. When cultivation reaches the spirit, harmonizing qi with the true, the embryo is complete—then naturally the heart follows the breath to its end, and qi arises with each exhalation. As the dusty realms dissolve, all entanglements are severed.

The *Treatise on Embryonic Breathing* states: “The embryo forms within primordial qi; warmth is born from the nose.” All lies in the single-minded application of dissolution—hence it is known as daily renewal. This is what is meant.

The Lower Mystery achieves the same merit—Laozi said: “What follows one after another.” As for the Yin Elixir, many deceive contemporary practitioners; those who truly attain it are few, while those who lose it are many. Most transmissions contain errors. Few attain it, while many who rely on flawed texts meet early death, failing to embody the original source and mistaking falsehood for truth. Once the mind stirs, it is like wildfire fed with flames—once ablaze, how can it be steadied? Thus the profound subtleties of the Dao arise from the mind’s method. If agitation stirs, qi surges wildly—how can this initial practice of the Dao instead harm life? Without understanding the deeper meaning of the *Double Mystery*, one vainly exhausts the efforts of Yin Elixir. To speak of the flavorless as if it were flavorless is also futile. If it is truly flavorless, why practice at all? Hence it is said to be futile.

The *Yellow Court Classic* states: “For long life, be most cautious in the bedchamber—haste turns life into death, making the spirits weep.” The perfected ones of Wangwu, Luo, Hu Gangzi, Yuanyang, and other immortals did not solely rely on Yin Elixir. They employed the mutual fusion of Dao and body, the method of spirit concentration. If beginners force themselves to practice, they may die prematurely, drifting ever farther from the Dao. The farther one drifts, the more the Dao manifests—how then can life endure? Thus the method of Yin Elixir was originally for transcending the dusty world. The ancient sages, fearing that true practitioners might not fully grasp it, presented it as an ordinary path, revealing the wonders of Yin Elixir. Its principle models heaven and earth, ascending yin and descending yang. What it forbids is the unruly mind, for when a man engages with a woman, he first loses his essence—practicing thus brings illness and hastens death. External factors such as the phases of the moon, wind and rain, hunger and satiety, joy and anger, exertion and rest must also be avoided. When a woman has her menstrual cycle, the six days following are governed by the three yang numbers—union during this time produces a son; the three yin numbers produce a daughter. In a month, these six days require both partners to descend in harmony to achieve success. From these calculations of yin and yang, one may also discern poverty and wealth, nobility and lowliness—its principles are self-evident.

**Mysterious Pass**
The Pass that excels at closing cannot be opened—Laozi said: “One who excels at closing needs no bolt, yet none can open it.” The Mysterious Pass is not merely the heart; if one understands the method of skillful closure to penetrate the profound, only then does it earn the name of Mysterious Pass. The art of skillful closure is the method of the mind-ground. Thus the numinous youth may come and go freely. The numinous youth is the title of one who attains the Dao. If one grasps the principle of the Mysterious Pass, one comprehends the way of skillful closure. Whether coming or going, one masters the essential method and attains lightness and ease. Once the six dusts are severed, the path of mystery opens. The six dusts are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—each has perceptions that stain them. Thus the Mysterious Pass excels at closure to dissolve these illusory dusts. Where the will reaches, mystery upon mystery unfolds. From this, life and death no longer pertain. Without the stains of dust and perception, how can there be attachment to coming or going? When mind and method are both forgotten, gain and loss dissolve together.

Master Xizhen said: “A hundred evils cannot disturb its rectitude; a thousand movements cannot disturb its clarity.” Thus life and death do not pertain to it.

**Mysterious Pearl**
How can the Mysterious Pearl be compared to worldly pearls? It is not a pearl outside the body, like a jade disk—hence it is said to be easily sought. The rhapsody states: “Movement is the pivot of the Dao; stillness is the lotus of the heart. Jade light does not shine, yet the utmost truth does not waver.” Those who awaken will know it as the tally of life. If one comprehends the profound principle of the pearl, one understands the essential convergence of life and thus holds the tally. Unobscured and unclouded, it responds to transformations—Laozi said: “Unobscured and unclouded, mystery upon mystery.” This reveals the original substance of the Mysterious Pearl, which corresponds and changes. Movement becomes a flaw, entangling and obstructing. When the mind moves, it chases after conditions—this is the flaw of the Mysterious Pearl. Thus it is said: “Movement becomes a flaw, entangling and obstructing,” and the Mysterious Pearl cannot become perfectly luminous.

**Gate of the Mysterious Female**
The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the numinous pass of communion with truth. The Mysterious Gate is the abode of spirit; the Female Gate is the great pass. This is the great essential of cultivation—hence it is called the numinous pass. Laozi said: “The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.” Without awakening to the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the practice of life-cultivation becomes difficult. If one does not grasp its principle, treating spirit and essence as the lock and key, then the endeavor of cultivation has no foundation. Those who practice haphazardly, like rowing against the current, may apply effort but fail to reach the true Dao. Laozi said: “Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.” The principle of balancing firmness and gentleness must be properly applied. Only after passing this rapids are there no more rapids. Once effort is perfected, one forever leaves worry and toil, dwelling in constant tranquility—hence it is said there are no more rapids.

**Mysterious Gate**
The nine caves and three mountains are known to few.

The nine caves and three mountains are the islands within the sea, where immortals gather and reside. Those who have mastered the profoundest learning often conceal themselves there, and thus these are cited to illustrate the origin of attaining the Dao, revealing that the Mysterious Gate is the pivotal essence of life-cultivation. The nine caves and three mountains also symbolize the three elixir fields and nine orifices of the human body. One must traverse this path to study and refine the truth.

Should one follow the Mysterious Gate to its end, all paths converge as one; if lost, every movement becomes misguided. Below, it connects to the Purple Palace and the Florid Canopy—the Florid Canopy being the lungs, the Purple Palace the kidney palace and sea of qi. For the Mysterious Gate’s opening and closing all correspond in resonance.

Gaining or losing, transcending the mundane is not transcending the mundane. If one attains the subtlety of the spirit’s abode, it endures—hence it is called transcending the mundane. If one loses the root of pure simplicity, wandering through the six destinies, it is said not to transcend the mundane.

**Gate of the Mysterious Female**
All orifices open because the Mysterious Female’s gate opens. The Mysterious Female’s gate is the great pass. When all orifices unfold, even the sinews, vessels, five viscera, and life-pass all respond in unison. Yet if one remains unaware as qi and fluids ebb, leading to decline and aging, how can one uphold the Dao and seek life?

Spirit and essence depart from here as if hastened. Once the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, it drains essence and qi. When essence and qi are depleted, the spirit gradually darkens, and perilous decay ensues.

Securing the pass and pivot is foremost. Those who cultivate life must first close the heavenly pass, making this their primary task. Those who are deluded often invite calamity. If one fails to comprehend the principle of opening and closing, merely indulging in sensory pleasures, then myriad misfortunes arise, cold and heat invade, and even the crown of the head perishes—all stemming from this.

**Cutting Off the Single Source**
Cutting off the single source is a subtle matter: severing the yin path to open the yang gate is the initial mechanism of the Dao. Laozi’s *Treatise on Embryonic Breathing and Subtle Essence* states: “Mysterious and yet more mysterious is my life’s gate.” The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* also says: “Cut off the single source, and one’s strength becomes tenfold. Thrice returning day and night, one’s strength becomes a hundredfold.” Without effort, one gains a hundredfold advantage—this is the cutting off of the single source.

Harmonizing and preserving the white principle governs the spirit’s mechanism. Harmonizing means regulating the source; preserving lies in the spirit’s mechanism operating in accord. If one remains attached to old habits, if thoughts are not extinguished and restraint is lacking, allowing dissipation to come and go, this is not the Dao.

In an instant, conflict arises, and right and wrong appear. If spirit and qi move chaotically, giving rise to reckless actions, then turmoil and discord emerge, becoming the source of errors.

**Heart**
Defiled and following conditions, even sages cannot fathom it. The heart is the function of nature. Following conditions and being stained by circumstances, arising and ceasing without constancy—even sages cannot exhaust its depths.

Yet all methods and teachings ultimately communicate through it. Countless methods, from transcending death to entering life, are all cultivated through the heart, and none reach completion without it.

Right and wrong, gain and loss all arise from this. All matters of right and wrong, whether grasped or abandoned, whether deluded or awakened, originate here. Returning to the root and reverting to the source, the Dao becomes ever more congruent. Returning to the root and reverting to the source, the Dao is the convergence of all scriptures; uniting with the Dao, one becomes one with it.

**Nature**
Nature is the heart’s origin, sharing the same path. Nature cannot be seen; it is revealed through the heart. The heart does not manifest itself; it arises through nature. Since it arises from the heart, it is said to share the same path.

Recognize the primordial yang to control the pivot of movement. Primordial yang is the qi of primordial harmony. It can restrain restlessness, thus serving as the pivot. This fully clarifies the heart’s method.

Relying on the congealed body, it is established. Just as one depends on a house to avoid wind and frost, nature relies on the physical form to be established. Yet the heart, returning, arrives at emptiness and nothingness. When the heart accords with the wondrous track and practices the method, it is said to return to the wondrous emptiness of the origin.

Movement is the heart—yet it moves without truly moving. Its movement responds to conditions, adapting without obstruction. Regarding the principle of all phenomena from beginning to end, knowing the arising and ceasing of others’ hearts, its subtlety is immeasurable, its merit unfathomable.

Transformation is without transformation, designation without designation. In the mundane, it is called deluded thoughts swirling; in the sage, it is called the functioning of the true origin. In stillness, it is nature—yet stillness is not true stillness. The Dao of vanishing transformation, the mechanism of ceasing response, neither stained nor soiled, without dust or defilement.

The radiant true wind of the lofty sages flows boundlessly; the transformation of the utterly deluded returns to the root, towering and majestic. The matter is real, yet words cannot describe it; the Dao is exalted, yet its principle is hard to convey. The past and future boundaries are empty, resplendent in the vastness of the primordial, blending into the harmony of virtue. Within the wondrous lies the most wondrous, the mysterious within the mysterious. This is returning to the source of transformation, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, where change is unfathomable.

**Dharma**
The Dharma is fundamentally wordless, yet its principle is naturally thus. Unbound by movement or stillness, its principle remains ever thus. Yet it is known to be the pivot of all scriptures. The myriad treatises and thousands of sutras set forth by sages cannot exhaust the Dharma, for it is the essential pivot.

If one has keen insight into the profound subtleties, grasping the deep essence within the mysterious, this is the true principle of the Dao. Secretly, it becomes the wondrous talisman within the heart. The Dharma is the wondrous talisman of the heart’s source, the great essential for arising and ceasing in life and death. It cannot be lightly sought or arrogantly pursued, nor known through restlessness, nor learned through error, nor attained through recitation, nor reached through traversal.

Though brightness and obscurity differ, it remains unchanged through ancient and modern times. The *True Word Secret* states: “To depart from death, first depart from life.” The principle of departure and retention is embodied and applied. Thus, the supreme perfected masters and the Most High’s Void Tradition may elucidate the three hearts or nine hearts, or reveal the one Dharma or myriad Dharmas. As for the imperial elixir formulas and the Jade Writ of the Azure Lad, their principles have a true return, their original source is without error. Clinging to stagnation and misapplying regulation, one cannot penetrate the wondrous; only by directly revealing the subtle and imperceptible can one grasp it.

The remaining transformations of the body and flights of form, the nurturing of the immortal embryo and the securing of life—even the mutual borrowing of the five phases, the constancy of movement and stillness, and the mutual Dao of the three bodies—all these are but branches and leaves, never reaching the root and trunk. This arises from receiving the Dao from teachers of varying depth, leading to attachments in principle based on what is seen and heard. One should earnestly seek deliverance, undaunted in seeking instruction and verification.
