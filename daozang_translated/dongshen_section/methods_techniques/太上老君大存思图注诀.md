**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Great Visualization Chart with Annotated Instructions**

Visualize the five viscera, the five sacred mountains, the five stars, the five emperors, and the golden radiance of the five-colored halo.

First visualize the Three Masters, then proceed to see the five viscera, the five sacred mountains, the five stars, and the five emperors.

The four preceding conditions guard the body within, wherein transformations occur without limit. As for drawing the chart, no method suffices to encompass all; thus, external symbols mark the directions, clarifying positions before speech. Do not rigidly adhere to progression.

The golden radiance forms one body, manifesting in five colors, emerging from behind the lungs. The nape bears a halo like the sun’s image.

The three preceding conditions reside within the body, illuminating the ten directions. Together with the four above, these seven conditions take the following forms:

Whenever visualizing, close the eyes and look inward. The human body contains many spirits, but the five viscera serve as the foundation. Each governs its affairs, and each affair achieves its completion. Completion in correctness unifies without division; undivided, the hidden and manifest remain free from deviation. Without deviation, all wonders become visible; seeing wonders, one aligns with the sagely talisman. Aligning with the sagely, one may then accumulate learning extensively, naturally achieving resonance.

Thus, morning and evening visualization must not be neglected. What is *cun* (visualization)? It is *dun* (sincerity) and *lun* (revolving). What is *si* (contemplation)? It is *si* (overseeing) and *si* (continuing).

Do not, through frivolity and impatience, lose the root of learning. Learning, through gravity and depth, attains the宗 (origin). Attaining the origin, circulation proceeds without obstruction; unobstructed, visualization endures without loss. Endurance arises from overseeing good and evil. Good and evil lie in the bias of desires. Bias arises from desires, loves, and hates, wavering in hesitation. The cycle of life and death, toil and suffering, never ceases. To cease this ceaselessness, cease attachment to goodness. The goodness of attachment to goodness has yet to return to the origin. Reaching the origin, the non-existent relies on念 (thought). Thoughts follow one another in succession, continuing contemplation and sustaining visualization. Without entering into questioning, acting without action yet accomplishing all—this is called subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating. Harmonizing light while subduing sharpness, it delivers boundlessly.

Thus, the foundation of learning takes visualization as its foremost practice, and the efficacy of visualization culminates in the five viscera. What are the *zang* (viscera)? They are *cang* (storing), *cheng* (completing), concealing spirit and hiding wisdom without ostentation. When wisdom manifests and desires stir, stirring leads to brilliance; brilliance leads to ruin, while concealment leads to completion. Shining without brilliance, wisdom stills and spirit congeals. Desires are eliminated, and within, purity arises—like jade within a mountain, inwardly luminous. Attaining this supreme principle, one achieves longevity and enduring vision.

**First, visualize the lungs:** red and white in color, seven lobes—four long, three short—connected below the throat.

What are the lungs? They are *chu* (restraining) and *fa* (striking). At the inception of good and evil, signs are yet unclear. Clarifying goodness strikes evil; clarifying evil strikes goodness. When goodness decays and evil flourishes, the root of life is struck. Whether the root severs or endures depends on this viscus.

This viscus stores the *po* (corporeal soul). What is the *po*? It is *po* (dregs) and *zhuo* (attachment). Human ostentation invariably relates to desire. Desire’s attachment is evil; evil resembles dregs. The foolish and vulgar cling to it, unaware of the essence of emotion. Now, wishing to mark and attach, visualize to perceive it. The *po* then becomes solemn, no longer capable of evil. Evil must be urgently discarded; thus, it is visualized first.

Fire and metal unite, success and failure yet undetermined. Their color is red and white; the number of lobes corresponds to speech, embodying harmonious completion of virtue. Virtue begins in the lungs and ends in the spleen. The spleen is one yet also two, encompassing equilibrium. Equilibrium embodies trust.

**Second, visualize the heart:** like a closed lotus bud or a suspended red oil sac, three inches long, located before the lungs.

What is the heart? It is *shen* (profound) and *zhen* (measuring).

The right and wrong remain undiscerned; weigh and measure with care. Failure leads to self-destruction, while success brings the Dao. The depth of fortune and misfortune lies within this organ.

This organ stores *shen*. What is *shen*? It is *extension* and *truth*, the sovereign of wisdom. When constrained, it can extend. Visualize to perceive it, and *shen* then congeals, recognition stabilizes into truth, and one cannot be deeply burdened.

**Third, visualize the liver:** a deep purple hue, with five lobes—three long and two short—nine inches in length, located below the heart.

What is the liver? It is *dryness* and *return*. Awakening to evil and correcting it, determination becomes unshakable. Practicing goodness and establishing merit, one acts with diligence. Discerning correctness and returning to the origin depend on this organ.

This organ stores the *hun*. What is *hun*? It is *abundance* and *reversion*. Amidst the tumultuous sea of the vulgar, it reverts toward the gate of the Dao. Visualize to perceive it, and *hun* then rejoices, urging progress and establishing merit, perpetuating virtuous deeds.

**Fourth, visualize the kidneys:** a lustrous dark hue, like an inverted pair of lacquered cups, five inches long, flanking the spine and attached to the back.

What are the kidneys? They are *tension* and *moisture*. Practicing goodness with tension, one dares not be negligent. Moisture is inexhaustible, aiding and delivering without limit, bridging the Dao and the vulgar—this depends on this organ.

This organ stores *jing*. What is *jing*? It is *clarity* and *numinosity*. Moving with gradual clarity, it transforms without obstruction. The numinous comes and goes, bearing the empty extreme. Visualize to perceive it, and *jing* then becomes serene, not dissipating or leaking.

**Fifth, visualize the spleen:** yellow and dark, twelve inches long, with a one-foot curved *yu* (granary) at its center, above the stomach.

What is the spleen? It is *support* and *transference*. Clear and congealed, it silently moistens, nourishing all. At rest, it can transfer; transferring, it does not deplete. Thus, the curve is completed within this organ.

This organ stores *zhi*. What is *zhi*? It is *ultimacy* and *distinction*. Profoundly moistening and secretly transforming the coarse and vulgar into the extraordinary, visualize to perceive it, and the efficacy in governing the vulgar is verified. *Zhi* then becomes profound, reaching the Dao.

Next, contemplate the Five Peaks.
What are the Peaks? They are *doubt* and *awakening*. Firmly settled and unshakable, their movement and transformation align with the Dao, awakening those lost in dreams. Scholars emulate them, hence the contemplation follows.

Contemplating the Peaks’ proper alignment within the organs refines this fleshly form into vajra.

**First, visualize Mount Tai, the Eastern Peak,** properly situated in the east.
What is the east? It is *youth* and *movement*. Moving to cultivate the correct Dao, its source becomes clear and pure—thus, the qi of this direction is clear. Its colors are mostly green; green spring governs *ren* (benevolence). The stirring of life should be cherished. Visualize it within the liver. With the liver free from calamity and stagnation, one preserves longevity. Life is the origin, hence it is visualized first.

**Second, visualize Mount Heng, the Southern Peak,** properly situated in the south.
What is the south? It is *capacity* and *reception*. When the season arrives, one’s conduct is capable and can be entrusted, broadly able to contain—thus, the qi of this direction is abundant. Its colors are mostly red; red summer governs *li* (propriety). Great affairs should be illuminated. Visualize it within the heart. With the heart free from calamity and stagnation, one preserves constant peace.

**Third, visualize Mount Song, the Central Peak,** properly situated in the center.
What is the center? It is *work* and *harmony*. What is *yang* (center)? It is *constancy* and *measure*. Revolving endlessly, its body is empty and attains the extreme—thus, the qi of this direction is harmonious. Its colors are mostly yellow; central correctness is without deviation, circulating without exhaustion, responding to all stimuli. Thus, yellow autumn governs *xin* (trust), encompassing essential density. Visualize it within the spleen. With the spleen free from calamity, one preserves eternal stability.

**Fourth, visualize Mount Hua, the Western Peak,** properly situated in the west.
What is the west? It is *chill* and *equilibrium*. The wife is earnest and pure, inner and outer equally immaculate—thus, the qi of this direction is fierce. Its colors are mostly white; white autumn governs *yi* (righteousness). Virtuous conduct should be comprehensive. Visualize it within the lungs. With the lungs free from calamity and stagnation, one preserves completion.

**Fifth, visualize Mount Heng, the Northern Peak,** properly situated in the north.
What is the north? It is *submission* and *blessing*. Movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness; regulation is inexhaustible. Exhaustion enables transformation, and myriad blessings are ever-renewed. Renewal is as if not renewed, subtly wondrous and profoundly mysterious—thus, the qi of this direction is gentle. Its colors are mostly black; black winter governs *zhi* (wisdom). Wisdom universally aids and delivers. Visualize it within the kidneys. With the kidneys free from calamity and stagnation, one preserves constant joy.

Next, contemplate the Five Stars.
What are the Stars? They are *essence* and *life*. Essence emerges from the obscure, manifesting in form, loosening all stagnation, and aiding longevity. The vajra’s utmost essence unites with *shen*.

**First, visualize Mars, the Blazing Deluder Star,** above the Southern Peak.
Its color is red; its essence is vermilion.
What is *ying* (blazing)? It is *restraint* and *dazzlement*.
What is *huo* (delusion)? It is *martial* and *predatory*.
Desire stirs and dazzles; governance falters, and predation harms. It is named the lord of chaos; chaos must be urgently governed. First, visualize to perceive it. To speak of chaos is to stabilize it. Once chaos is stabilized and made manifest, trust becomes evident, righteousness becomes clear, clarity enters wisdom, and wisdom enables enduring preservation.

**Second, visualize Saturn, the Quelling Star,** above the Central Peak.
Its color is yellow; its essence is radiant.
What is *zhen* (quelling)? It is *trust* and *stability*. Its radiance is resplendent; inner and outer affairs are settled. The four directions do not transgress; trust has its subtlety.

**Third, visualize Venus, the Grand White Star,** above the Western Peak.
Its color is white; its essence is pure.
What is *tai* (grand)? It is the greatest of the great.
What is *bai* (white)? It is *luminous* and *restrained*.
Luminous and restrained, it can receive all hues. When all hues attain it, they become distinctly manifest. Applied as appropriate, none can surpass it—hence it is called *Tai Tai*, surpassing all names.

**Fourth, visualize Mercury, the Chronographic Star,** above the Northern Peak.
Its color is black; its essence is profound.
What is *chen* (chronographic)?

Profound, authentic, and latent.
Latent yet aptly established, beginning and end without flaw, untarnished by defilement—this is the stillness of wisdom.

**Fifth, visualize Jupiter, the Year-Star,** above the Eastern Peak.
Its color is azure; its essence is verdant.
What is *sui* (year)?
It is *boundary* and *fulfillment*.
Discarding the old and embracing the new, exhausted yet able to penetrate, through boundaries it meets again, thus accomplishing its work.

Next, visualize the Five Thearchs:
What is *di* (thearch)?
It is *discernment* and *attainment*.
The sincerity of refined authenticity gives rise to this spirit-form. Form and spirit both wondrous, their responses are inexhaustible. Examining and reaching the ultimate origin, there is no regression.

**First, visualize the Yellow Thearch.**
Within the Saturn-star, descending to hover above the Central Peak.
It proclaims and regulates the spleen’s *qi*, connecting human aspirations.
Palaces of towering cliffs, halls of seven treasures, robes and feathered regalia, attendants with parasols, civil and martial retinues with music—all hues are predominantly yellow. Desires and vows seek verification; transformations await confirmation. Thus, first visualize it, for sincerity is the master.

**Second, visualize the White Thearch.**
Within the Venus-star, descending to roam above the Western Peak.
It proclaims and regulates the lung’s *qi*, dispelling human stagnation.
Palaces of towering cliffs, halls of seven treasures, robes and feathered regalia, attendants with canopies, civil and martial retinues with music—all hues are predominantly white.

**Third, visualize the Black Thearch.**
Within the Mercury-star, descending to traverse the Northern Peak.

It proclaims and regulates the kidney’s *qi*, nourishing human essence.
Palaces of towering cliffs, halls of seven treasures, robes and feathered regalia, attendants with canopies, civil and martial retinues with music—all hues are predominantly black.

**Fourth, visualize the Azure Thearch.**
Within the Jupiter-star, descending to traverse the Eastern Peak.
It proclaims and regulates the liver’s *qi*, encouraging human goodness.
Palaces of towering cliffs, halls of seven treasures, robes and feathered regalia, attendants with canopies, civil and martial retinues with music—all hues are predominantly green.

**Fifth, visualize the Vermilion Thearch.**
Within the Mars-star, descending to advance upon the Southern Peak.
It proclaims and regulates the heart’s *qi*, stabilizing human spirit and wisdom.
Palaces of towering cliffs, halls of seven treasures, robes and feathered regalia, attendants with canopies, civil and martial retinues with music—all hues are predominantly red.

Next, visualize the golden radiance enveloping the body:
Behold the luminous forms of the Five Thearchs, guarding within the body, their five stellar colors flying and covering the exterior.
Mars hovers above the head, Mercury rests before the heart, Jupiter stands between the knees, Saturn at the left elbow, Venus at the right shoulder—light and color intermingling, blending into a golden radiance.
What is this radiance? It is vastness, a mirror.
What is this gold? It is resilience, reverence.
The body assumes a golden-purple hue, the spirit’s *qi* pure and harmonious, vast and profoundly still, bright as a flawless mirror. Resilient and firm, it severs doubt and dispels evil, elevating the ordinary to sagehood.

Next, visualize the body manifesting five colors:
What are these colors? They are discernment, recognition.
Subtle *qi* responds to perception, dispelling delusion; delusion yields to truth, exposing falsehood. Once false colors are discarded, true colors naturally emerge. Through refinement and transmutation, the weak are tempered, and sagehood is attained.

First, behold white *qi* issuing from the lungs; second, red *qi* from the heart; third, green *qi* from the liver; fourth, yellow *qi* from the spleen; fifth, black *qi* from the kidneys.
Previously seen were the radiant stellar forms of the Five Thearchs, coalescing into golden radiance. Now, the five *qi* of the five viscera emerge in sequence, ascending to the head, revolving in five colors, crowning and enveloping the body, thick and misty, as if immersed in dense smoke.

Next, visualize a halo around the neck:
The body has transformed into a golden-purple hue, further enveloped by the revolving five *qi*, resplendent in majesty. A halo arises around the neck, encircling above and below, luminous and blazing, illuminating the ten directions.
It dissolves all evil, penetrating within and without, leaving no blemish of impurity. The radiant spirit is undivided; the Dao is one.

Upon completing the visualization, pay homage to the ten directions, then to the true scriptures and perfected beings, saying: When bowing to the scriptures, focus the mind on the Most High Lord Lao, offering three bows. Next, invoke Master Yin and the Perfected One of the River’s Edge, along with the Master of the Mystic Teachings, and bow three more times. Thirty-six thousand immortal youths and jade maidens constantly attend the scriptures, burning incense on behalf of the practitioner to seek the Dao of ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

**Seated Morning Visualization**
Seated morning practice entails sitting upright to perform the rites. If public or private affairs obstruct, or if one finds oneself among those of different inclinations, one may not bow fully in the hall—simply sit composed, concealing the practice from others. Incense and offerings need not be avoided; they may be used discreetly. Even if others mock, one may omit the rites, taking care not to offend their sensibilities or exacerbate their faults. From dawn to dusk, perform the practice at the proper times. When making daytime invocations, it is also fitting to sit calmly, maintaining an ordinary demeanor without altering one’s appearance, so that those of different inclinations remain unaware. If others notice and approve, one may guide them; if they scorn or slander the true and upright, they bring misfortune upon themselves and corrupt their own cultivation. The ancients studied the Dao for themselves; today, many study it for others. Those who practice for others seek to please, disregarding the falsity in their hearts. Those who practice for themselves focus on sincerity—whether adhering or deviating, the heart remains the source. The more one strives to subdue others without true intent, the more futile the effort, and the greater the transgression. Those who study the true Dao must each deepen their sincerity. Sincerity values timely convergence, and timing values harmonious union. If the union is not virtuous, one should not converge at that time. Convergence must bring mutual benefit, aiding both others and oneself. Virtue and virtue align; abandoning evil, one ascends as an immortal. Abandoning evil to ascend as an immortal is the purpose of convergence. Converging with evil leads to ruin, where names and realities diverge. In one’s conduct and circumstances, two afflictions may arise: the first is mental stagnation, the second is clinging to the near. For those who cling to the near, transform them through the method of the heart. For those with stagnant minds, guide them through the method of proximity. Neither heart nor proximity should be biased; transform clinging and guide stagnation. When both afflictions are dispelled, the Dao of the highest sages is attained.

When traveling through mountains and waters, or spending days in boats and carriages, whether in transit or at rest, whether walking, climbing, or lodging, whenever weary and pausing to rest, perform the visualization rites at the proper times. Adapt to concealment or openness as circumstances allow, and concentrate the visualization with precision. Naturally, fatigue will be forgotten, and demonic or malevolent people will not dare to disturb. When reciting scriptures and observing precepts, conduct oneself with virtue. If one’s conduct lacks virtue, precepts are broken and scriptures violated. Even if one performs the rites, the true will not be perceived. Jealous ghosts and malevolent spirits, along with wicked people and harmful things, will clash and provoke one another, giving rise to afflictions and disasters, leaving no peace even when seated outside. Swiftly visualize the Nine Practices to regulate the body. With the heart focused and the mouth reciting, understand clearly without doubt. Stabilize the Three Actions, and once they are settled, all disasters will dissolve. People and ghosts will revere and submit, safeguarding one’s comings and goings, movements and stillness, ensuring steadfast good fortune.

The Nine Practices are found in the *Xianger Commentary*, and the Three Actions follow the *Mingwei Sutra*. Those who practice visualization must urgently recall them, as outlined below:

Practice non-action; practice gentleness and weakness; practice holding to the feminine, never moving first. These are the first three practices.
Practice namelessness; practice purity and integrity; practice all virtues. These are the middle three practices.
Practice desirelessness; practice knowing when to stop and be content; practice yielding and deference. These are the last three practices.

The first: do not kill.
The second: do not steal.
The third: do not engage in licentiousness.
These three pertain to bodily action.

The first: do not speak falsely.
The second: do not use flowery speech.
The third: do not engage in double-tongued speech.
The fourth: do not use harsh language.
These four pertain to verbal action.

The first: do not be envious or obstructive.
The second: do not harbor anger.
The third: do not hold perverse doubts.
These three pertain to mental action.

The above Nine Practices and Three Actions, comprising ten matters, should always be kept in mind. In moments of alarm or peril, recall them swiftly—danger will turn to safety.

For attire, wear a jade-green cap, a blue-green robe, and a yellow garment, adapting as appropriate.

**Seated and Reclining Visualization**
The method of reclining: do not lie flat like a corpse. Instead, lie on one side, keeping the body composed. Do not sprawl the limbs or use a high pillow—only about three inches. Make a pillow of fragrant herbs; do not use foul or rotting wood, as its cold dampness and stench will offend the *niwan* (mud-pill palace). Even when traveling and temporarily resting, one must guard against this. Upon rising from sleep, recite incantations and vows, maintaining virtuous thoughts. Visualize the morning rites at the proper time; do not omit them. If public or private affairs obstruct, repent afterward. When leaving the chamber in the morning, visualize the Jade Maiden. The Jade Maiden is the wondrous *qi* of spontaneity, taking form in response to resonance. Her form and substance are luminous and pure, clear and bright as jade, hidden yet moistening, manifest yet without perversity. As the practitioner cultivates the true, they ascend step by step. Advancement and retreat lie in form; entry and exit lie in the Dao. The *qi* of the Dao is subtle and wondrous, responding even to the finest detail. Responses unfold in order, from the humble to the exalted. Thus, in daylight, the Jade Maiden guards the palace; at night, the Maiden of the Evening attends to affairs, aiding in overcoming peril and attaining the fruition of the Dao. Wear a jade-green cap, a green robe, and a light garment, adapting the rest as appropriate.

When leaving the chamber at dusk, visualize the Maiden of the Evening. Upon exiting, recite: "Maiden of the Evening, communicate with the numinous." Before ascending to the mysterious, one must not be without practice. Practices vary in excellence, but all require a foundation. When the foundation is refined, the fruit is wondrous, and the spirit becomes unified. If the spirit is not unified, it is because the practice is not yet refined. Refine it gradually, drawing yin to aid yang. Human life resides in the yang realm; movement and stillness return to yin. Yin is the subtle mechanism of the Dao, and its responses are most wondrous. At the inception of this wondrous response, the Maiden of the Evening appears, upholding rectitude to govern perversity, harmonizing and releasing arrogance, punishing evil and protecting good. Through yin virtue, she aids yang, her luminous fame as bright as jade. She is steadfast and pure; cherish and visualize her, and attainment of the true will be swift.

When practicing the Dao, visualize the *qi*-soldiers and cavalry. At dawn, first visualize azure clouds filling the purification hall, with blue-green dragons and lions guarding the front and rear.

Next, visualize azure *qi* emerging from the master’s liver, ascending like clouds. Within this azure *qi*, blue-green dragons and lions move back and forth, covering the bodies of the disciple’s household, large and small. Divine youths and jade maidens, celestial immortals, earthbound immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, stars, and Five Thearchs—along with nine hundred million *qi*-soldiers and cavalry—oversee the ritual, attend to the proceedings, and arrange the officials of the Three Realms to left and right.

At the center, visualize crimson clouds filling the purification hall, with vermilion phoenixes and red birds crying out to left and right. Then visualize crimson *qi* emerging from the master’s heart, ascending like clouds. Within this crimson *qi*, phoenixes and red birds move back and forth, covering the bodies of the disciple’s household, large and small. Divine youths and jade maidens, celestial immortals, earthbound immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, stars, and Five Thearchs—along with nine hundred million *qi*-soldiers and cavalry—oversee the ritual, attend to the proceedings, and arrange the officials of the Three Realms to left and right.

At sunset, visualize yellow clouds filling the purification hall, with yellow dragons and yellow *lin*-beasts guarding the four directions. Then visualize yellow *qi* emerging from the master’s spleen, ascending like clouds. Within this yellow *qi*, yellow dragons and yellow *lin*-beasts move back and forth, covering the bodies of the disciple’s household, large and small. Divine youths and jade maidens, celestial immortals, earthbound immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, stars, and Five Thearchs—along with nine hundred million *qi*-soldiers and cavalry—oversee the ritual, attend to the proceedings, and arrange the officials of the Three Realms to left and right. The three periods of practice follow the six periods as prescribed below.

At the hour of *ren ding*, visualize white clouds filling the purification hall, with white tigers and *qi*-*lin* guarding within and without. Then visualize white *qi* emerging from the master’s lungs. There is no need to visualize the *qi*-*lin*; instead, focus on the white tiger. If visualizing the *lin*, see the white *lin* within the white *qi*, moving back and forth to cover the bodies of the disciple’s household, large and small. Divine youths and jade maidens, the sun, moon, and *qi*-soldiers follow the previous method.

For the great Yellow Register purification ritual, the three periods of practice should begin at sunset. For ordinary purifications, the three periods may begin at *ren ding*. If using *ren ding*, the visualization at sunset remains the same. However, practicing all six periods in sequence—beginning with azure, then crimson, and cycling through white—deviates from the proper method. Azure, crimson, and white each have their own distinct forms, none of which correspond to the five viscera and six bowels.

At midnight, visualize dark clouds filling the purification hall, with divine turtles and soaring serpents guarding above and below. Then visualize black *qi* emerging from the master’s kidneys, ascending like clouds. Within this black *qi*, divine turtles and soaring serpents move back and forth. Divine youths and jade maidens, the sun, moon, and *qi*-soldiers follow the previous method.

At dawn, visualize violet clouds filling the purification hall, with apotropaic lions guarding the hidden and manifest, their forms as depicted to the left. Then visualize violet *qi* emerging from the gallbladder, following the previous method.

In all visualizations of cloud-*qi*, each arises from its respective direction: azure clouds from the east, crimson clouds from the south, yellow clouds from the center, white clouds from the west, black clouds from the north, and violet clouds from above. Observe them emerging from their directions, gradually growing in abundance, thick and misty, filling the hall. Then visualize the *qi* of your own viscera emerging to merge with the clouds of corresponding colors. When *qi* and clouds unite, they become luminous, pure, fragrant, and immaculate, covering and protecting the household, the palace city, mountains, and waters—encompassing all, great and small. Divine officials and spirit-beasts align in perfect order before and behind, to left and right, within and without, above and below, hidden and manifest. In the six periods, the flourishing of numinous spirits is all-pervading.

During the *shang jiang* lecture, sit and visualize the three colors and the Three Ones of the hun and po souls. When delivering the lecture, first visualize the three colors, then the Three Ones.

The practice has six periods, while the *shang jiang* lecture is held in three: after the morning meal, at *shang bu*, and at *ren ding*. During these three periods, enter the purification hall, take incense, bow three times, circumambulate, and return to your seat. When seated, if there is an assembly, the Dharma Master strikes the mat with a whisk and places the clapper before the knees. All close their eyes and clasp their hands firmly, visualizing azure *qi* at the head, crimson *qi* at both hands, and white *qi* at both feet. The three *qi* encircle the body, their forms as depicted to the left.

Visualize the Three Ones of the hun and po souls. The Three Ones are the spirits of three regions united in one Dao. Though the Dao is fundamentally one, its responses manifest as three. Within and beyond the Three Realms, there is nowhere it is not present. It governs transformation and presides over all things, known as the Three Heavens’ Supreme. When proclaiming teachings and attending to scriptures, it is called the Three Pure Left Lords. When descending to perfect human virtue, it is named the Three Ones.

The Three Ones reside within humans, who possess three palaces: the brain is the Upper Prime Palace, its spirit named Yi; the heart is the Middle Prime Palace, its spirit named Xi; and below the navel is the Lower Prime Palace, its spirit named Wei. Each appears as an infant, all one *cun* in length. Sit in stillness, hands clasped, free from desire and action, the body devoid of all but the essential. This is what the aspirant to immortality visualizes. With prolonged and steadfast practice, spiritual penetration becomes thorough, and transformation thereafter knows no obstruction. All movements align with the Dao, the subtle is entered without fail, and the vast is encompassed without limit. It may become boundless or infinite. At the inception of observing the wondrous, one begins with the *cun*-sized form, its shape as depicted to the left.

The Perfected One says: During purification, the mind must focus on the mysterious and true, without external distractions. When thoughts turn to the scripture master, first visualize the Three Ones within their chambers, dwelling clearly and distinctly, complete with the three hun souls and seven po souls. The Great One presides over the *ni wan* palace, as in the *Hui Feng Di Yi* method. Then, together with the disciple, engage in purification and listen to the scripture. Through oral transmission and mental visualization, the Three Corpses flee, perverse *qi* is extinguished, and inner and outer receive the true. Thus, one draws near to immortality.

Additionally, practice exhalation and inhalation, guiding and harmonizing fluids, and perform the wondrous methods described above. Heavenly Perfected Ones will then descend to you. The superior adept attains the Dao within their chamber. Though dwelling in mountain caves, if even a single thread of external thought persists, it is but vain labor and wasted effort. In learning the Dao, the mind must be wholly devoted and the will resolute. The Immortals observe and test you in that very moment. Disciple, examine this carefully.

Wear a jade crown, a blue-green robe, and a pale yellow garment; the rest may be chosen as appropriate. When first ascending the high seat, first visualize and pay homage to the Three Worthies. Before expounding the meaning or reciting scriptures, first sit in stillness. Then rise, face the seat of the Supreme, and offer incense three times. Step back several feet, bow three times to the Three Worthies, and again visualize the scripture master, register master, and preceptor, bowing once to each—six bows in total. Then ascend the high seat, its form as depicted to the left.

The Three Worthies are the Dao-Worthy, the Scripture-Worthy, and the Perfected-Worthy. The Three Ones’ Worthiness pervades the human body. Those who wish their bodies to align with the Three Worthies must purify themselves through fasting, refine their thoughts, and perform rites of homage and visualization. Do this once daily: first descend to perform six bows, then ascend again without further bowing. Upon descending, perform two bows, knocking the forehead and reciting vows according to the proper method—those who are weak may perform the bows in their hearts.

When ascending the high seat, visualize the attendants and guards. Settle into a composed posture, hold the scripture tablet before the heart, strike the drum thirty-six times, and swallow saliva thirty-six times. With eyes closed, envision the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before, the Dark Warrior behind, the Eight Trigrams and divine tortoise beneath the feet, thirty-six lions crouching ahead, the Seven Stars of the headscarf, the five viscera each generating five riders, and the net-like scriptural patterns covering the body. The Three Ones attend the scriptures, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand qi, while jade lads and maidens serve as guards. The form is as depicted to the left.

When the recitation of the *Five Thousand Character Text* reaches ten thousand repetitions, the Supreme Lord’s thunderous chariot descends to welcome you. If, upon completing ten thousand repetitions, you do not depart, recite it thrice monthly. When the cloud chariot arrives, you will ascend as an immortal. The form is as depicted to the left.

In the practice of the ten-thousand-repetition Dao, also visualize the Five Cloud Stars. After reciting the scripture, from midnight to the hour of generative qi, fully absorb the Five Sprouts’ qi. Sit facing the direction of the monthly constellation, knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Five Stars: the Chronographic Star above the head, Jupiter at the left elbow, Venus at the right elbow, Mars between the knees, and Saturn at the heart. Persist in this for a long time.

In all actions—sitting, rising, coming, and going—constantly hold this visualization without forgetfulness. A thousand disasters will naturally cease, and ten thousand calamities will be unable to assail you. Later, water will emerge from above your body and fire from below. With the six penetrations of wisdom, you will suddenly behold the Five Elders.

The Five Elders are the essences of the Five Stars. Upon seeing them, you will gain mastery over transformations and ascend together into the heavens. The Perfected don a jade crown, a green robe, and a yellow garment, with chariots, attendants, and cloud motifs chosen as appropriate.

After receiving the scripture, maintain perpetual fasting and preserve the Real. Forsake the secular and cultivate the Dao, refining your thoughts while reciting the text. Recite ten times daily, and over three years—one thousand days—complete ten thousand repetitions. Once you have thoroughly understood and fulfilled the practices, with refinement complete and virtue abundant, body and spirit will unite, and cloud dragons will come to welcome you, ascending to the Three Clarities.

If, upon completion, you do not depart, there are two possibilities: first, your merit is perfected and virtue accomplished, yet moved by compassion to aid the age, your destiny has not yet concealed your light, so you remain to inspire later generations; second, your practice is not yet exhaustive, your conduct not fully perfected, your refinement not yet precise, and your thoughts have not summoned a response—though the recitations are complete, you have not ascended. You must then further refine your progress, dispel desires, contemplate the wondrous, diminish the self to deliver others, establish merit with courage, and maintain strict visualization. Whether many or few, practice thrice monthly, harmonizing self and other, accumulating merit and virtue without interruption, linking goodness to goodness. Constantly behold the Three Worthies, and the cloud chariot will arrive of itself. With time, spiritual penetrations will surely manifest.

Impatience leads to obstruction; even with a hundred million repetitions, you will not transcend. Only when your conduct is complete will body and spirit ascend together.

Conduct is complete when you embody the seven virtues of ritual, wisdom, trust, and salvation of heaven and humanity. Though you may possess these five virtues, if they are faint and you do not universally deliver beings, your salvific merit will be slight—this is not complete conduct, and you cannot hope to attain the Dao.

The means to attain the Dao lie in practicing the five virtues. One who practices the five virtues stabilizes the three karmas, fulfills the ten good deeds, and the Great One will descend, the Five Elders will accompany you—attainment of the Dao is then without doubt.

The *Great Visualization and Annotation of the Supreme Lord Lao* concludes.
