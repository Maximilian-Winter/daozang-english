All things in the world are born, receiving form and manifestation from yin and yang. Yin and yang bestow transformation, deriving from primordial qi to differentiate cold and heat. Thus, when the Great Yang arises, it bears the radiant glow that gives life to all beings; when the Great Yin stirs, it carries the somber qi that withers all sprouts. None escape the influence of qi in their birth and decay—this is the constant principle before the moon, known to the noble person.

As it is said: "One who consumes primordial qi cannot be slain by Heaven nor concealed by Earth"—how excellent! When primordial qi is exchanged between the kidneys and nose, and yin and yang are divided within the viscera, with exhalation and inhalation unerring and regulation unbroken, then the gateway to longevity may be attained.

The oral formula I record here is the method for absorbing primordial qi. Its many secrets are transmitted only by mouth, for they cannot be contained in brush and paper. Though I describe but a portion, it is the essential teaching of this school. All who are devoted to this practice must not lightly disclose it.

Within the human abdomen lie three barriers: the first is below the heart. Beginners in qi absorption always feel fullness below the heart in the stomach. Eat sparingly, and with prolonged practice, you will naturally sense the passage downward to the barrier below the viscera, where the abdomen feels full. With further practice, you will feel it reach the Cinnabar Field below the navel. Only then will you sense qi circulating throughout the body, though it has yet to enter the *jiu* (turtledove) center. Later, when qi emerges from the *jiu*, you will be able to heal others.

When first learning, you must settle the body in a quiet place and proceed with care. Once qi enters the abdomen, you may practice while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down without hindrance. If the stomach’s qi has not descended, do not attempt other methods, for they will be difficult to master.

At the start of qi absorption, inhale and hold the breath briefly, as if closing it, until full. Upon exhalation, release only two-thirds of the breath, then hold again. After a short pause, swallow. Repeat until the abdomen is full, then rest. Practice this day and night at all four times, for beginners’ qi has not yet entered the Cinnabar Field and easily scatters. Continuous practice ensures the qi remains connected. Once qi enters the Cinnabar Field, even if you cease absorption, it will not disperse.

The four times are dawn, dusk, midnight, and noon. If the heart feels full, refrain from absorbing qi and chew a small amount of licorice or cinnamon to disperse the fullness. The Cinnabar Field will not yet be full, nor will it feel so. When primordial qi descends, a slight oppression arises naturally.

When first absorbing qi, practice four times daily. At dawn and dusk, use both the supine and prone postures; at midnight and noon, use only the supine posture. For the supine posture, lie on a low pillow, face up, draw in the legs, and raise the knees. Place both hands at the sides, then swallow qi. After ten swallows, qi will fill the Cinnabar Field. Wait an hour after swallowing, then guide the qi with intention into the *jiu* center.

For the prone posture, lie with the abdomen flat, propping the chest with a blanket to elevate it. Extend the hands and feet, then swallow ten times. With each swallow, guide the qi with intention to descend along the spine and exit through the *shu* (heat) viscera. At dawn and dusk, practice first prone, then supine. Each swallow must produce a sound; without sound, the effort is in vain.

When swallowing qi, do so slowly and deeply in the throat. Do not swallow forcefully, or coughing will result. Between each swallow, pause for ten breaths, or rest as needed at your leisure.

Do not swallow qi mixed with saliva; swallow it dry. If saliva arises, swallow it separately. When swallowing saliva, use inhalation to prevent wind from entering deeply—proceed with care.

After receiving the method for absorbing qi, recite the incantation to complete the transmission. In daily practice, incantations are unnecessary, but recite them each time when healing others.

Beyond the four regular sessions, if at any time you feel a lack of strength in the abdomen, swallow qi as needed. Initially, absorbed qi often leaks downward from the *shu* viscera—consolidate it to prevent leakage, guiding it with intention to disperse.

When first absorbing qi, the mind must be at ease, free of doubt and fear. Do not worry or hesitate, for fear obstructs the flow of qi. If the four limbs are harmonized, remain content in stillness, desiring nothing. Progress will be daily, and joy will be boundless.

Do not think of food while absorbing qi; remain free of all thoughts. If thoughts of food arise, suppress them as if unconcerned. Without suppression, the mind will dwell on them. If thirsty, boil *bili* vine decoction with a small amount of fresh ginger, simmering it once or twice. Drink a bowl, and thirst will subside. Ginger-honey decoction also suffices. If you can restrain yourself, even facing fine delicacies all day will not stir desire.

Absorb qi without missing the proper times, keeping the Cinnabar Field always full. Even if you attend to daily affairs, it will not hinder practice. With long habit, even missing an hour or two will not matter.

When swallowing qi, the supine posture expels water, and the prone posture expels food. The food viscera lies on the right, the water viscera on the left.

With prolonged practice, qi will naturally reach the *jiu* head. When swallowing qi in the prone posture, guide it with intention to descend along the spine, focusing on the abdomen near the spine. Listen for the sound to descend and exit through the *shu* viscera, directing it to the right.

If qi becomes full and oppressive, leaking downward uncontrollably, it is not a concern. Guide the qi to exit through the crown and the four limbs. With long practice, you will sense this naturally.

If you have not yet sensed it, simply rely on focused intention—that is sufficient. With prolonged practice of swallowing qi, you will attain the qi of the Cinnabar Field, and when you pat it, it will resound with a *peng-peng* sound. Even if the qi in the head has not yet filled, this is still achievable. If you wish for the head to be fully filled, simply take in more qi—this will suffice. As qi moves like a creeping insect, with time you will naturally sense it; there is no other method.

Someone asked: How can it resemble the sensation of eating? For beginners, it must be like this. With long practice, it will become the same as eating.

After swallowing qi, circulate it throughout the body. Do not force it to exit; let it leave naturally, as when one goes about their affairs. If your strength wanes, swallow qi again—there is no need to wait for a set time.

Visualize internally until the intestines are empty. Close your eyes and inwardly observe, and you will see the waste in your intestines—it is extremely difficult to empty completely. Even after fasting for over twenty days, it will only just be gone. When first fasting for fourteen days, you must eat one or two meals of cooked vegetables daily to expel old waste. At each meal, you may eat a bowl of alfalfa mustard greens or turnip greens without issue. Boil away the bitter juice, add a little oil and ghee, and season lightly with salt, soy sauce, or vinegar to give it flavor. Do not add rice or grains, as the goal is to purge the intestines of grain qi. After eating vegetables for four or five days, then stop eating the vegetables and only drink their juice for another three to five days before ceasing entirely.

Each day, drink a little wine as you please. Once the abdomen is empty, drink a large amount of wine to induce vomiting and expel phlegm from the chest—this will make you extremely refined. Each day, you must eat pepper, about three to two *liang*. Take one *he* of pepper, clean it thoroughly, and remove the seeds. For those who keep their mouths closed or avoid dust, use wine, water, creeping fig infusion, or vegetable broth to swallow it. This will benefit qi and expel foul substances from the abdomen—this is a secret method.

Ginger has the property of softening things. If there is food in the abdomen, drinking ginger soup is not an issue, but once the food is gone, it is no longer appropriate. If vegetables contain wild wormwood or *huying*, they must not be eaten, as they can disrupt one’s qi.

When swallowing qi in the supine posture, guide it into the intestines and then into the *jiu* head. When swallowing in the prone posture, guide it to exit through the *shu* viscera.

Humans have both *shu* viscera and *sheng* viscera. After practicing for a month, qi will begin to enter, coiling in the intestines with a faint sound, circling and humming as it turns—this is the sign. Follow the method.

The more the intestines coil and turn, the better. Twelve turns are superior; ten, nine, seven, five, or three turns are progressively lower. Those with only two or three turns are the lowest. The intestines of the base are wide and short—keen but lacking wisdom. Width pertains to keenness, shortness to lack of wisdom. The best is to have long intestines; if they are short and thin, one is not of the human kind.

The heart governs spirit-qi, the liver governs restrained qi, the lungs govern killing qi, the spleen governs Dao-qi, and the kidneys govern original qi. The qi swallowed at the proper time is internal qi.

Those with long intestines find it easier to retain qi; those with short intestines find it harder. When practicing qi-swallowing and the intestines churn with sound, press the right side against a bowl, clasp your head with your right hand, and pull your left foot with your left hand, straightening your body and right foot. Swallow qi and guide it into the right foot—this allows for prolonged practice. Each time qi descends with a sound, the sound coils and winds through the intestines, and where it coils, a sound is made. Count the coils and track the sound as it flows and turns with a *yo-yo* murmur. A faint sound indicates smooth circulation.

The human intestines have four bends and nodes, the number of which you should also remember.

**Method for Distinguishing External Qi and Original Qi**
Original qi and external qi do not mix. If you swallow external qi, it will soon leak out from below and not remain in the intestines. If you circulate qi to the head and brain, the heat in the brain will rise and flow toward the feet—this is the same. If you first circulate yang qi, you will feel the feet first cool, then warm. Why is this? Because yang qi expels yin qi, hence the effect. If you first circulate yin qi, yang qi will exit first, and the feet will feel as hot as fire before cooling. All other cases follow this pattern. If you can circulate qi into the head, you will begin to prevent facial wrinkles.

**Lord Lao’s Method for Guarding Unity and Cultivating the Body**
At midnight, when original qi begins to arise, lick your teeth with your tongue, moisten your lips above and below, inhale through the nose, and swallow through the mouth—repeat twenty-seven times. This will cause the generative qi to flow through the hundred vessels, granting long life.

**Method for Cultivating the Body:**
Upon rising in the morning, first exhale slowly. Rub your palms together until hot, then stroke your forehead fourteen times—this is called "nourishing the Mud Pill Palace," ensuring the body’s spirits are complete.

Next, rub your hands together until hot and wipe your face fourteen times—this is called "dry bathing." It dispels malign qi, for the face is the dwelling of the Foot-Long True Person; seeing it keeps one free from illness.

Next, rub your hands together until hot and stroke your body fourteen times—this is called "bathing the body," preventing cold and wind.

Next, rub your hands together until hot and stroke your hair from the forehead fourteen times, visualizing the hair spirit guarding life—this is called "bathing the head." It prevents hair from turning white and teeth from falling out, allowing them to regrow.

Next, rub your hands together until hot and clasp your ears from below, pulling upward fourteen times—this sharpens hearing. Each ear has two spirits, named Jiao Nü.

**Method for Guarding Unity and Cultivating the Body:**
Upon rising in the morning, after dressing, stroke your head and recite the incantation:
*"Great fortune, long life, all illnesses cured,
Meet at the Gate of Blessing,
The five viscera harmonized, no worries,
All spirits fast and follow my body,
Granting me fearlessness even in old age."*

After reciting, step forward. First, advance the left foot and say: *"Qian, next."*
Then advance the right foot and say: *"Yuan, next."*
Advance the left foot again and say: *"Heng, next."*
Advance the right foot and say: *"Li, next."*
Finally, advance the left foot and say: *"Zhen, auspicious."*

"As it is said: *Qian, Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen.*
The body governs the ten thousand spirits;
At the Jade Gate, one beholds the bright sun and attains great fortune, fulfilling all desires.

**Method for Guarding Unity:**
Always cherish qi, be cautious in speech,
Let qi enter abundantly and exit sparingly,
Return qi to replenish the primordial,
Contemplate the primordial qi—
Thus shall one attain longevity.

**Method for Guarding Unity:**
When lying down, always follow the four seasons and eight solar terms:
In spring and summer, rise early, awakening with the orioles;
In autumn and winter, rise late, awaiting the sunlight without aversion.
To act contrary is to invite harm.

**Incantation for Commanding the Body’s Spirits:**
Solemnly command the five viscera and six bowels within my body,
The nine palaces and twelve spirit chambers,
The four limbs and five constituents,
Sinews, bones, marrow, and brain,
Skin, flesh, blood, and vessels,
Orifices, constructive and defensive qi,
One hundred eighty muscle gates,
Three hundred sixty bone joints,
One thousand two hundred forms and shadows,
Twelve thousand essences and radiances,
The three hun on the left, the seven po on the right,
The three ghosts and five spirits—
Atop my head, the Vermilion Bird;
Beneath my feet, the Dark Warrior;
To my left, the Azure Dragon, supporting and guiding;
To my right, the White Tiger, escorting and sending;
The Vermilion Bird leads before, bearing banners and pennants;
The Dark Warrior follows behind, bearing bells and drums.
Let my heart resist evil,
My liver resist illness,
My lungs resist treachery,
My kidneys resist confusion,
My spleen resist death,
My gallbladder resist fear,
My stomach resist filth.
May my qi soar on wings,
Further enhanced by guiding and pulling.
Swiftly, swiftly, as I have declared!

If one treads upon filth or any inauspicious place,
One must bathe and rinse to dissolve the body’s impurities.
The method employs:
Ten liang of bamboo leaves,
Four liang of peeled peach bark,
Boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water until a single boil,
Then cooled to a suitable temperature for bathing—
All misfortunes shall vanish.

If washing the hair, this method is not solely employed,
For this is the refined essence for bathing the body.
Thus, one must not wash the head with it;
Instead, follow the usual method for washing the hair.
