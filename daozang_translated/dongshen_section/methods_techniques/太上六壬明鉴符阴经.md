# 太上六壬明鉴符阴经

*The Supreme Six Ren Illuminated Talisman of the Hidden Classic*

**Title:** *The Supreme Six Ren Illuminated Talisman of the Hidden Classic*. Author unknown. Four scrolls. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the "Methods" category of the *Dongshen* section.

**Scroll One**

In ancient times, Sun Bin and Pang Juan swore brotherhood and sought instruction from Master Guiguzi, studying the arts of military strategy and combat. One day, their master, observing the ripening fruit in his garden, ordered Sun Bin to keep watch. That night, a figure suddenly leapt over the wall into the garden and began stealing the fruit to eat. Sun Bin concealed himself, blade in hand, ready to strike—only to discover it was a white ape. Seizing it, he heard the creature speak: "Do not harm me! I was born with heaven and earth, grew alongside the sun and moon, and took form through the coagulation of primordial qi. I possess a mysterious text. Come to this place tomorrow, and I shall transmit it to you."

Sun Bin knelt in reverence and withdrew. The ape then transformed into a beam of white light and vanished. The next day, Sun Bin returned at the appointed time. Suddenly, the white ape descended from the northwest through the void, bestowing upon him a scroll of mysterious scripture. In an instant, it turned into white light and departed toward the southeast.

Sun Bin took the text back to his lodging and examined it by lamplight. He found two scrolls: one titled *Six Jia Celestial Taboo* and another *Six Ding Celestial Taboo*. The beginning and end were missing, leaving their full titles unknown. He divided the text into three volumes—upper, middle, and lower—and named it after the white ape.

Those who practice this method must cultivate purity of the Dao, abstaining from forbidden foods for one hundred days. With sincere devotion, after a hundred days of practice, one may become invisible to others, and even spirits will not hear their voice. This teaching is most strictly guarded; it must not be transmitted to the unworthy. Should Heaven be offended, misfortune may follow. Thus, it must be kept secret.

**Hunyuan Formula**
**Hunyuan Formula Incantation**

Hunyuan’s singular form,
Before yin and yang divided.
The true Dao of Heaven’s One,
Gave shape to all transformations.
Now revealed, now concealed,
Emerging from darkness, entering the unseen.
Amid a thousand soldiers, ten thousand troops,
Who could perceive my form?
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

On the night of the Winter Solstice, prepare three portions each of tea, wine, fruit, dried venison, oil lamps, vegetarian offerings, rare incense, gold coins, and cloud-horses. Use a piece of blue silk eight inches long and three inches wide, and with a new brush and cinnabar, compose a blue petition to invoke the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor. At the third watch of midnight, face the sacred, hold the silk in the left hand and the cinnabar brush in the right, recite the incantation forty-nine times toward the northwest, and draw forty-nine breaths of qi. Blow them onto the silk and the altar offerings. At the first light of dawn, report to the deities, burn paper offerings, present the petition, and conclude the ritual, dismantling the altar. Place the formula in a blue pouch and hang it in the sacred chamber.

Beginning on the night of the Winter Solstice, at the third watch of midnight each night, face north, burn incense, and kneel in worship. Hold the silk formula in the left hand and a sword in the right, recite the incantation seven times, and draw seven breaths of qi from the northwest. Blow them onto the silk, the sword, and the entire body after stepping the Dipper’s steps. Place it over the heart. Ascend through the Gate of Heaven, pass the Great Yin, and gaze toward the Celestial Treasury—none in the eight directions shall perceive you.

**Tianyuan Formula**
**Tianyuan Incantation**

Tianyuan’s singular qi,
Before yin and yang divided.
Intermingling ascent and descent,
Above and below mutually engender.
Concealing and containing the ten thousand things,
My form thus takes form.
Making others not see,
Making spirits not hear.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

On the night of the Winter Solstice, prepare offerings and a blue memorial for the Hunyuan Formula, and inscribe the talisman on blue silk. After completing the ritual, conceal it in a blue silk pouch. Perform this nightly for one hundred days, and it shall yield profound efficacy, drawing qi from the Gate of Heaven.

**Tianyuan Talisman**
**Diyuan Formula**

Tianyuan descends with qi,
Diyuan arises as earth takes form.
Yin and yang harmonize,
One descends, one ascends.
Transforming the ten thousand things,
Each assumes its shape.
My body responds to change,
Now hidden, now divine.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

On the night of the Beginning of Spring, prepare tea, wine, and offerings as for the Hunyuan Formula, using a yellow silk scroll one *chi* long and five *cun* wide. Write the memorial in cinnabar. At the third watch of midnight, face the sacred, hold a cinnabar brush in the left hand, and recite the incantation forty-nine times toward the southwest. Draw forty-nine breaths of qi and blow them onto the silk. After inscribing the formula, place it on the altar for veneration until the fifth watch, then conclude.

From the night of the Beginning of Spring onward, at the third watch of midnight, burn incense, kneel in worship, and face the southwest. Recite the incantation seven times, draw seven breaths of qi, and blow them onto the silk, the sword, and the entire body after stepping the Dipper’s steps. The ritual procedure follows that of the Hunyuan Formula.

Adapting to all things and circumstances.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

On the night of the Beginning of Spring, compose a blue memorial, with offerings identical to those of the Hunyuan Formula. Use a blue silk eight *cun* in length and three *cun* in width, and perform the ritual as previously instructed. Face the northwest and recite:

Emerging from darkness, entering the unseen."*

**Renyuan Talisman**
**Two Modes Formula**

The qi of the Great Ultimate transforms,
The Two Modes intermingle and divide.
Dispersing to create the ten thousand things,
Concealing within my body.
Adapting to all transformations,
Every intention manifests as reality.
A thousand armies, ten thousand foes—
Blind and sightless as the unseeing.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

This method is practiced on the night of the Beginning of Summer, with offerings as before.

**Three Powers Formula**

Yin and yang unfold,
The Three Powers divide their qi.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, use a blue silk eight *cun* in length and three *cun* in width, with offerings as before, and perform the ritual likewise. Face the east to draw qi.

For each method, on the corresponding day and night, prepare the same offerings as for the *Hunyuan* ritual. The green memorial text and petition format remain identical. At the third watch, hold the appropriately colored silk in the left hand and the brush in the right, facing the proper direction. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw in forty-nine breaths of *qi*, and blow them onto the silk and cinnabar brush. After inscribing the talisman, place it upon the altar for veneration.

*This concludes the first scroll of the* **Supreme Clarity Six Ren Luminous Talisman Yin Canon**.
*Here begins the second scroll of the* **Supreme Clarity Six Ren Luminous Talisman Yin Canon**.

**Method for Crafting the Talismanic Surcoat**

The August Emperor issues his command:
The ritual surcoat conceals one’s form.
Clouds and mist veil me,
Hiding this body of mine.
A thousand soldiers, ten thousand troops—
All who gaze upon me are struck blind.
Those who oppose my forces perish;
Those who yield to my forces live.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!

On the *jiazi* day, or on any of the Six Jia nights, use the same offerings as before, along with the green memorial petition. At the third watch, hold the ritual surcoat in the left hand and the brush in the right, face the northwest, and recite the incantation forty-nine times. Draw *qi* forty-nine times and blow it onto the surcoat and brush. With the left sawing motion, write "I am revealed"; with the right sawing motion, write "I am concealed"; then saw again to write "conceal this body of mine." Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!

Once the back seam is inscribed and the talisman completed, place it upon the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, take the surcoat, hold it in the left hand, pass it through the incense smoke, and don it. With the right hand grasp the sword, and with the left form the Dipper’s *gang* mudra. Recite the incantation seven times, draw *qi* seven times, and blow it upon the body. Practice the Dipper-stepping for a hundred days.

When wearing the surcoat into battle, its radiance will strike the enemy forces, rendering them unable to approach within a hundred paces. Even if they draw near, they will not perceive one’s form. If the black surcoat is crafted on the *gengshen* day, make it two *zhang* two *chi* by one *zhang* two *chi*, in the style of an armored robe.

With the above ritual surcoat, even if surrounded by ten thousand soldiers, one may exit through the Gate of Heaven, enter the Great Yin, roam the Nine Earths, and depart to the Heavenly Vault—passing through a thousand men unseen.

When receiving the surcoat, place a red silk sash measuring three *chi* six *cun* upon the altar. Hold the silk in the left hand and the brush in the right, recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw *qi* forty-nine times, and blow it onto the silk and brush. Inscribe the center of the sash, then place it upon the altar for offerings. The incantation reads:

*Flame Sovereign of the South, Fire Bell Lord,
True Fire of the Great Yang, Radiant Star of Mars.
Fire chariots and blazing light, arrayed as honored spirits,
Streaming flames for ten thousand *li* to illuminate the enemy forces.
Eyes like the blind—none shall see;
The enemy’s form is routed, my forces secure.
Peace and tranquility—swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

**Method for Crafting Ritual Weaponry**

The Eight Great Vajras,
The Four Great Divine Kings,
The Four Generals of the North Pole,
Assist with divine power and radiance.
The Six Yi, Six Ding, and Six Jia—
Divine edge and divine light.
Strike down the enemy forces;
Those who oppose me are wounded.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!

Craft the weaponry on the *wuwu* day, and employ it on the *jiazi* night, following the *Hunyuan* ritual. At the third watch, hold a three-*cun* crimson silk in the left hand and the brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw northern *qi* forty-nine times, and blow it onto the brush and silk. Inscribe the talisman, then place it upon the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, conclude the ritual, fold the silk into a pouch, and hang it in the spirit chamber.

On the early morning of the *dingmao* day, enter the chamber and affix it to the weaponry or military standard, placing it in the chamber’s life-prospering direction. When needed, hold the weapon in the left hand and pure water in the right. Face north, recite the incantation, draw *qi* seven times, and blow it into the water. Take a mouthful, exhale it onto the weaponry, and polish it thoroughly before use.

The enemy forces will be unable to flee or approach, and will not dare draw near. This aids the Radiant Kings, forever dispelling the smoke of war.

Now my might shakes the four walls and eight directions.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

**Six Jia Suppression Talisman**
Your servant [Name], on behalf of [Client], petitions against [Target], who curses heaven and earth, disobeys and dishonors parents, deceives and plots against the sovereign. By the authority of the Six Jia Divine Arrows, I hereby suppress [Target] with illness—rendering them mute, stricken with pain, and fated to die—eradicating this treacherous minister who betrays ruler and parents, this unfilial and disloyal rebel.

Your servant [Name] humbly invokes the Heavenly Suppression Spirit King, the Solar Suppression Spirit King, the Hourly Suppression Spirit King, and the Six Ding Divine Arrow Suppression Kings. May they heed this plea and swiftly descend with efficacious aid, afflicting [Target] with muteness and agony.

When my suppression method moves eastward, trees shatter and splinter.
When it moves southward, scorching flames vanish.
When it moves westward, vajra cracks asunder.
When it moves northward, rivers and seas run dry.
When it ascends, clouds and stars dim their light.
When it descends, the earth’s crust ruptures.
When my suppression reaches the spirits, they rest in peace and harmony.
When my suppression falls upon the disloyal and unfilial, upon those who deceive their sovereign and plot against their lord—[Target]—they shall instantly suffer muteness, heart pain, and death.

The law is enacted; swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

This method is received on Six Ding and Six Jia days, following the same procedure as the Primordial Talisman. After presenting the green memorial and concluding the offerings at the fifth watch, hold the talisman in the left hand each night. With the right hand, take a vermilion brush, face the corresponding direction, recite the incantation, draw *qi* forty-nine times, and blow it onto the silk and brush. Inscribe the respective talisman, then place them in order upon the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, conclude the ritual, fold each into a pouch of its corresponding color, and hang them in the spirit chamber. When needed, follow the method precisely; the target will die within seven days.

**Six Jia Spirit Suppression Talismans**
- **Right Jiachen Talisman**: Use five inches of yellow silk.
- **Right Jialin Talisman**: Use eight inches of green silk.
- **Right Jiawu Talisman**: Use seven inches of red silk.
- **Right Jiashen Talisman**: Use nine inches of white silk.
- **Right Jiaxu Talisman**: Use five inches of yellow silk.
- **Right Jiazi Talisman**: Use six inches of black silk.

**Six Ding Spirit Suppression Talismans**
- **Right Dingmao Talisman**: Use eight inches of green silk.
- **Right Dingsi Talisman**: Use seven inches of red silk.
- **Right Dingwei Talisman**: Use five inches of yellow silk.
- **Right Dingyou Talisman**: Use nine inches of white silk.
- **Right Dinghai Talisman**: Use six inches of black silk.
- **Right Dingchou Talisman**: Use five inches of yellow silk.

Draw a figure resembling the target, its head pointing toward the enemy’s dwelling. On the target’s destined day of death, day of doom, or hour of demise, go to your own bedchamber. Face the direction of the enemy’s doom—where their fate, life, hour, body, and destiny are severed. Inscribe the talisman on their back.

Hold the figure in the left hand and the brush in the right. Face the corresponding direction, recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw *qi* from that direction, and blow it onto the enemy’s shadow and the brush. Write in vermilion over the heart, noting the year, month, day, hour, and name.

Align the talisman with the target’s direction and press the arrow into it. Pierce one inch into the heart, recite the incantation once, draw black *qi* from the corresponding direction, and blow it onto the figure, arrow, and the enemy’s dwelling. Take another mouthful of *qi* and blow it onto the figure and arrow. Repeat this seven times, reciting the incantation seven times, driving the arrow one inch deeper each day. Perform this ritual once daily at the target’s destined hour of death.

By the fifth day, the target cannot be saved. If the arrow is removed within five days, the person will survive. If performed for seven days, the target will surely die. Upon death, bury the figure and arrow in the place of their demise.

This method must not be recklessly transmitted, lest it shorten the lifespan of descendants. However, for those who are disloyal, unfilial, deceive their sovereign, or plot against their lord, it will take swift effect.

**Divine Spear Ritual Method**
By imperial decree, the Eight Spirits guard and protect the divine spear.
Bestowed upon valiant generals, it shatters enemy forces and spreads radiance.
Aiding our enlightened sovereign, it forever dispels the smoke of war.
Now my might shakes the four frontiers, and all kings pay tribute.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

This method is performed on a *jiazi* day at night, with offerings and a green memorial presented as in the Primordial Talisman. At the third watch, during the *zi* hour, hold three inches of green silk in the left hand and a brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, face the northwest, draw *qi* forty-nine times, and blow it onto the silk and brush. Inscribe the talisman, then place it upon the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, conclude the ritual, fold it into a green pouch, and hang it in the spirit chamber.

On a *dingmao* day, place it in the armory, tying it to a bamboo pole. Position Zhenwu or the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman at the spear’s tip, shielding it with an umbrella. Do not move it from the life-prospering direction of its destined bearer.

Offer incense and fruit, and on the 7th, 17th, and 27th days of the month, burn incense and present paper money or spirit horses. When marching, place it before the tent in the life-prospering direction of the destined bearer.

If auspicious events occur, the spear will sound a report:
- Three peals: honorable officials rejoice.
- One peal: kinfolk rejoice.
- Two peals: disaster.
- Four peals: calamity.
- Five peals: the spirits manifest their power.

*This concludes the second scroll of the* **Tai Shang Liu Ren Ming Jian Fu Yin Jing** *(The Supreme Six Ren Illuminated Mirror of Talismanic Yin Methods).*
*Here begins the third scroll of the* **Tai Shang Liu Ren Ming Jian Fu Yin Jing.**

The Celestial Blazing Star and Celestial Benevolence descend in honor. The Celestial Pillar gathers with them, summoning the Ancient Husband of the Celestial Heart to shatter bandits. The Celestial Auxiliary manifests its might; the Celestial Surge executes raiders; the Celestial Inner conceals form and heart. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

This method is performed on the Summer Solstice at the third watch of the night. As before, hold the silk of the respective star’s talisman in the left hand and a brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, drawing forty-nine breaths of *qi* from the nine stars’ directions. Blow them onto the silk and brush. Once the talisman is inscribed, arrange and offer it upon the altar according to its directional position. At the fifth watch, disperse the offerings. Store each talisman in a silk pouch of its corresponding color and hang them in the spirit chamber.

On the following night at the third watch, burn incense and bow. Hold the talisman in the left hand and a sword in the right. Pass the talisman through the incense smoke, recite the incantation seven times, draw seven breaths of *qi*, and blow them onto the silk and sword. Step the Dipper and practice the method.

**Ten Stems Method**
*Jiǎ*, *yǐ*, *bǐng*, *dīng*, *wù*, *jǐ*, *gēng*, *xīn*, *rén*, *guǐ*—the ten stems, honored spirits of might. I practice the divine talisman, entering and exiting the unseen realms, shattering enemy raiders and quelling the dust of war. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

This method is performed on a *jiǎzǐ* day at night, following the Primordial Unity method. At the third watch, hold the silk in the left hand and a brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, drawing forty-nine breaths of *qi* from the ten directions. Blow them onto the brush and silk. Once the talisman is inscribed, offer it upon the altar. At the fifth watch, disperse the offerings. Store each in a pouch of its corresponding color and hang them in their respective directional positions within the spirit chamber.

On the following night at the third watch, bow, burn incense, and practice the method as before.

**Eight Gates Spirit Method**
Step the Dipper as before: first enter *xū*, then *sì* to enter *dīng*, then the Nine Earths, gaze toward the Celestial Gate, and step the Dipper straight ahead without looking back.

**Tàiyī Method**
Lord Star, Minister Star, People Star; Great Wanderer, Lesser Wanderer, Direct Spirit, Four Spirits. Heaven One, Earth One, Five Felicity Star Lords. Celestial Talisman, Earthly Talisman, Heavenly Moon, Calculating Spirits. Heavenly Systems, all generals—host and guest must be distinguished. Three Winds, Five Rains, the stars’ timely might, the Great Yin’s crimson spirit. I receive your mandate and summon your descent. The talisman emerges from water and fire, conjures violent winds and sudden rains. Thunder and lightning follow my will; the talisman completes and conceals my form. Or it hides my true self, moving through myriad crowds unseen. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

This method is practiced on the winter solstice night, with offerings as in the *Hùnyuán* ritual. At the third watch, hold the silk in the left hand and the brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw forty-nine breaths of *qi* from the north, and blow it onto the silk and brush. After inscribing the talisman, place it upon the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, disperse the altar, store the talismans in pouches, and hang them in the spirit chamber. Practice this on the following night as before; great efficacy will manifest.

**Tàiyī Talisman**
On yielding days, perform the *Yǔ* step with the *Gāng* incantation. On firm days, step the Yang *Yǔ*; on yielding days, step the Yin *Yǔ*. First enter the Celestial Gate, pass through the Earthly Door, traverse the Great Yin, wander the Nine Earths, and gaze toward the Celestial Treasury. Depart with the *Yǔ* step, going straight ahead without looking back.

All *Tàiyī* methods employ the Dead *Yǔ* step; their spirit efficacy is unfailingly responsive. Simply maintain a pure and sincere mind, practice according to the method, and the highest sages will not fail—only the practitioner’s own doubts may hinder it.

When first setting out for military campaign, select an auspicious day and hour. The general and troops shall exit through the Celestial Gate, with the great general leading the vanguard. Recite the incantation:
*"Heaven is round, Earth is square; the Six Jiǎ and Nine Chapters. The Four Seasons, Five Phases—red, azure, white, yellow. Tàiyī commands the troops; the sun and moon are their light. Yǔ is the Yin path; Qiáng wards off soldiers. The Azure Dragon assists on the left, the White Tiger marches in camp. The Dark Warrior arrays first, dispelling misfortune. The Northern Dipper executes punishment and removes inauspiciousness. My spirits aid me, traversing the eight directions."*

"Whoever opposes me shall die; whoever encounters me shall perish. I am the great-grandson of the North Pole Star. Today, I lead the troops forth, intending to exit through the Celestial Gate and the Earthly Door. As the enemy forces advance, their blades, halberds, bows, and crossbows shall all shatter—none dare harm me. *Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

After reciting the incantation, lead the troops forward a hundred paces, ensuring none look back. Most auspicious.

The Yellow Emperor said: From the hour of *jiǎzǐ* to *guǐyǒu*, if contrary winds arise within these ten hours, the army cannot advance—this is most inauspicious. One must observe the wind rising from the west, then stand bareheaded and barefoot, clad in black robes and wielding a sword, reciting the incantation seven times—the wind will turn of its own accord. The incantation reads:
*‘Adverse wind, treacherous wind, great fortune amidst misfortune. Divine qi harmonizes, above and below commune. Avoid me, avoid me—return my radiant might!’*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

Upon completion, take seven steps westward, sighing toward the page, and the wind will immediately shift.

From *jiǎxū* to *guǐwèi*, within these ten hours, if adverse winds arise, march five hundred paces south—you will surely encounter a red serpent upon the path. Then proceed five hundred paces east, where you will find a man in white robes, bearing weapons. Recite the incantation seven times:
*‘At the hour of *xū*, parching winds arise—all spirits retreat. Whoever stands in their path shall be slain; whoever lingers shall meet ten thousand deaths. Hearing this pure and resplendent voice, the wind reverses and sinks into the earth.’*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

After reciting, spit toward the wind, and it will turn. If at the hour of *wǔ*, replace with *‘At the hour of *wǔ*, parching winds arise’*—the rest follows likewise. Thus, misfortune is transformed into fortune. This method is stored in the Golden Casket and must not be recklessly transmitted.

**Rite for Summoning Wind**
*Three winds, five winds—jade arrays the eight winds. Qi-Upholding Star, Wing and Chariot Star Lords. I now invoke and beseech you—may your decree be everlasting and swift.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

For all wind-summoning rites, follow the prescribed form to invoke them. When winds uproot trees and shatter houses, flying stones and snapping forests—let them favor our ranks and oppose the enemy’s. Aid the state, pacify the people, advance the righteous path with haste, quell dust and subdue the strong. Illuminate the four borders by dawn, offering tribute to the enlightened sovereign, bringing peace to the realm and transforming the people.

On the night of *gēngshēn*, perform the Primordial Rite with offerings. At the third watch, hold a strip of blue silk (or white, five *cùn* long and three *cùn* three *fēn* wide) in the left hand and a brush in the right. Face west, recite the incantation forty-nine times, then inhale forty-nine breaths and blow upon the silk and brush. Complete the talisman, place it upon the altar, and disperse at the fifth watch. Store it in a colored pouch and hang it in the spirit chamber.

The following night at the third watch, first burn incense. Hold the talisman in the left hand and a sword in the right, pass them over the incense, and recite the incantation seven times. Inhale seven breaths and blow upon the talisman, sword, and your entire body. Step the Dipper’s *gāng*, and after a hundred days of practice, it may be used.

When employing it, face the enemy’s ranks and arrange seven talismans, each one *chǐ* and four *cùn* apart, in the formation of the Seven Stars of the Dipper, all facing north. Have attendants clad in black, with unbound hair and bare feet, march northward, bearing the talismans. You yourself, barefoot and with unbound hair, wear black robes, hold the talisman in your left hand and a sword in your right. Step the *gāng*, then command each attendant to sound their horns. Direct the talisman toward the *xùn* palace, facing the enemy. When the horn blasts cease, a violent wind will arise, blowing against the enemy’s forces. Raise the talisman and ride the wind to strike the enemy—utterly routing their troops.

**Rite for Summoning Rain**
*Celestial Honored One, Earthly Talisman—Heavenly Sovereign Star. Tàiyī convenes, engendering rain and mist. Azure Dragon leads the host, the Rain Master marches alongside. Wind Earl and Thunder Duke, inverse thunder’s roaring might.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

Perform this rite on the night of *rénzǐ*, offering alongside the Primordial Rite. At the third watch, hold a strip of blue silk (eight *cùn* long and three *cùn* six *fēn* wide) in the left hand and a brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, inhale forty-nine breaths from the north, and blow upon the brush and silk. Complete the talisman, place it upon the altar, and disperse at the fifth watch. The following day, practice as before for a hundred days.

When employing it, have seven boys in blue robes, with unbound hair and holding vessels of pure water, face north in a formation one *chǐ* and four *cùn* apart, arranged like the Seven Stars of the Dipper. You yourself, with unbound hair and clad in black robes, hold a sword in your right hand and the talisman in your left. Step the Dipper’s handle, point toward the enemy, and have the boys hold their water vessels. Recite the incantation toward the army, then prostrate upon the ground—the rain will fall immediately, drenching the enemy’s forces. Seize the moment to strike, and the enemy’s troops will be utterly defeated.

The boys recite:
*Nine rivers and four seas, Five Lakes’ Dragon Lords. Leading the Thunder Duke, the Rain Master marches alongside. Wind Earl and thunder crash—torrential rain descends. Hail and thunderbolts strike the enemy’s ranks.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command!*

**Method for Turning Level Ground into Rivers** *(No incantation in the original text)*
Perform this rite on the night of *rénzǐ*, offering alongside the Primordial Rite. At the third watch, hold black silk in the left hand and a brush in the right. Recite the incantation forty-nine times, inhale forty-nine breaths from the north, and blow upon the silk and brush. Complete the talisman, place it upon the altar, and disperse at the fifth watch. Store it in a black pouch and hang it in the spirit chamber.

The following night at the third watch, burn incense. Hold the talisman in the left hand and a sword in the right, pass them over the incense, and recite the incantation seven times. Inhale seven breaths and blow upon the silk, sword, and your entire body. Step the Dipper’s *gāng* and trace the talisman upon the ground with the sword—wherever it is drawn, the path will become impassable, forcing retreat. After a hundred days of practice, it will be infallible.

**Method for Igniting Fire on Level Ground**

**Fire Lord Invocation**

Fire Lord, Fire Lord,
Radiant Star of the Great Yang.
Fire Marshal of the Blazing Emperor,
True Fire of *bǐng*-*dīng*.
Swiftly descend with true fire,
block the path and intercept the troops.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

This method is practiced on *bǐng*-*dīng* days and nights, with offerings made to the Primordial Talisman. At the third watch, hold the black silk in the left hand and the brush in the right, face south, and recite the incantation forty-nine times. Inhale forty-nine breaths of *qi* and blow upon the silk and brush. Complete the talisman, place it upon the altar, and disperse at the fifth watch. The following night, proceed as before. After a hundred days of practice, it will be infallible. When executing the method, follow the previous steps without looking back.

*Liù-jiǎ* is the Azure Dragon,
*Liù-yǐ* is Heavenly Pivot,
*Liù-bǐng* is the Hall of Light,

**Memorial to the Throne**

A humble Daoist disciple, your subject [Name], with reverence and trepidation, bathes and purifies himself before submitting this memorial. With head bowed and repeated prostrations, I humbly address the Most High, the Heavenly Venerable Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal, Who Upholds the Dao in True Form and Governs the Celestial Calendar:

I, your subject, am but a fleeting mortal of dust, dull-witted by nature. Yet, by fortune, I have encountered the true Dharma and thus take refuge in it. Previously, I received the *Four Scrolls of the White Ape*, and now I practice the *Seven Numinous Talismans*, establishing an altar with utmost purity.

I humbly pray that the High Perfected Ones deign to look upon me, and that the Host of Sages bestow their compassion, so that my Daoist heart may awaken, and the canonical methods become clear to me. May my strategic designs ensure victory, leaving no enemy daring to challenge. May my steps through the Dipper’s *gāng* rally the troops, leaving no foe aware of my presence. I vow to maintain the incense offerings, in reverent repayment to the vast heavens.

Your subject [Name], overwhelmed with awe, gazes toward the heavens and longs for the sagely presence, trembling with utmost sincerity.

Respectfully submitted.

**Enclosure:**
With utmost care, respectfully presented.
Your subject [Name], in all humility, seals this without.

*Golden Portal Chamber*
*Concluding Chapter Three of the* **Tai Shang Liu Ren Ming Jian Fu Yin Jing**
*Chapter Four of the* **Tai Shang Liu Ren Ming Jian Fu Yin Jing**

**Urgency Calls for Divine Aid; Delay Seeks the Gate**
The *Three Primordials Scripture* states: In urgent matters, one cannot choose the time or the three auspicious *qí* and favorable gates. Instead, use the gate where Heavenly One resides and the spirit of the current talisman.

If time allows, wait for the three *qí* and avoid the six *wù* palaces of heaven, for these are ever the Heavenly Gates.

For example, during the Upper Epoch of Winter Solstice, on a *jiǎ-sì* day at dawn, Heavenly One resides in the sixth *bǐng* of the eight palaces, and the current talisman is in the first palace. In urgent matters, one may proceed to the northeast under Heavenly One, the due north under the current talisman, or the six *wù*—all are auspicious.

The *Three Primordials Scripture* states: When deploying troops, use the six *wù*, which is the Heavenly Gate. Enter the Earthly Gate, which is the six *jǐ* passing through the Great Yin, the six *dīng*. Ride the Azure Dragon, the six *jiǎ*. If one abides by this, victory is assured in every battle.

The above pertains to exiting the Heavenly Gate, entering the Earthly Gate, passing through the Great Yin, and riding the Azure Dragon.

For example, during the Upper Epoch of Winter Solstice, on a *jiǎ-sì* day at midnight, when first deploying troops, exit the Heavenly Gate at *zǐ*, enter the Earthly Gate at *sì*, pass through *mǎo*, and ride the *zǐ* earth—victory will be assured in every battle.

**Another Method:**
When departing, the six *wù* of heaven are in the Heavenly One palace, the Earthly Gate of heaven is in the ninth palace, and the Great Yang of heaven is in the seventh palace. The Azure Dragon resides in the first palace of heaven.

**Concealing One’s Form and Erasing Traces**
Wu Zixu said: To conceal one’s form, ride the Azure Dragon, transforming into the six *jiǎ*. Pass through the Hall of Light, the six *bǐng*. Exit the Heavenly Gate, the six *èr-wù*. Enter the Earthly Gate, the six *jǐ*. Pass through the Great Yin, the six *dīng*. Take a blade of grass, break it in half, and use one half to shield yourself. Place the other half in the *mǎo* earth and enter the *yǒu* earth. No one will see you. When passing through the Great Yin, recite the incantation:

*"Heaven overturns, earth collapses,
the nine paths are all blocked.
Should anyone pursue me,
they shall not catch up."*
Enter Heavenly Concealment, and do not look back.

**Gēng** is the Heavenly Prison; **xīn** is the Heavenly Court. **Rén** is the Heavenly Jail—avoid or resist it, and you shall be bound. *Swiftly, swiftly, as in statute and decree!*

**The Jade Maiden’s Reverse Closure**
The Scripture states: For the Jade Maiden’s Reverse Closure, measure six *chi* within a chamber, six *bu* in a courtyard, and sixty *bu* in the wild—all reckoned by six. First, determine the tally, then arrange it. Take six counting rods in your left hand, each one *chi* and two *cun* in length, made of thorny bramble or any available material. Hold a blade in your right hand, face the direction of the flourishing *qi*, inhale the flourishing *qi*, and invoke the flourishing spirit while clicking your teeth twelve times. Pray for your heart’s intent, then stand with your back to the flourishing direction and recite the incantation:

*"On this year, month, day, and hour, so-and-so respectfully invokes Heaven and Earth, Father and Mother, the Six *Jiǎ*, the Six *Xún*, the Twelve Hour Spirits, the Azure Dragon and Comet Stars, the Heavenly Jade Maiden, and the Six *Wù* Concealing Spirits: I delight in the arts of longevity, traveling without haste, departing without regard for time. Now, as I journey for such-and-such a purpose, I beseech the great ministers to unseal the celestial patterns. I request the Jade Maiden to trace her formation, exiting the Heavenly Gate, entering the Earthly Door, sealing the Golden Pass. Mounting the Jade Maiden, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Curved Array, Dark Warrior, Six Harmonies, Six *Jiǎ*, Six Spirits, and Twelve Hour Spirits, I ride forth to such-and-such a place. In the hidden recesses to my right, I shall rise and vanish at will, warding off bandits and thieves, dispelling ghosts and spirits. Should a nobleman encounter me, his joy shall redouble. Should a petty man meet me, he shall tremble in terror."*

Men and women who see me shall offer wine and libations. All evil ghosts and bandits who confront me shall perish. Today, with the Yu Step, I align with the Celestial Stem; the Jade Maiden attends beside me, warding off misfortune below. Ten thousand spirits submit and cower—wherever I go, no harm shall befall. The ailments I treat shall be cured; what I attack shall be opened; what I strike shall be shattered; what I seek shall be obtained; what I desire shall be fulfilled. Should emperors, great ministers, or officials of the Two Thousand Stone rank encounter me, they shall cherish me as their own child.

Today, I summon the Jade Maiden and the great ministers to advance with me. Once the invocation is complete, close the *qi* and rotate the blade leftward, inscribing the earth to form a diagram. Begin from the current day’s cyclical sign, using no blade but the finger to arrange the twelve cyclical hours, the eight stems, and the four cardinal directions. Then, enter the diagram from the position of the day’s stem: on a *wù* day, enter from *qián*; on a *jǐ* day, enter from *kūn*. Once the diagram is drawn, take its center as the base, aligning east, west, south, and north to array the twelve spirits and the positions of the eight stems and four directions.

For example, on a *jiǎ* day, enter from the *jiǎ* position; on a *yǐ* day, from the *yǐ* position; on a *bǐng* day, from the *bǐng* position; on a *dīng* day, from the *dīng* position; on a *wù* day, from the *qián* position; on a *jǐ* day, from the *kūn* position. Within the diagram, hold six counting rods and offer prayers, bowing to the four directions and invoking:

*"I beseech the Eastern Functionary, Great Surge, Heavenly Manifestation, Azure Emperor, and the great spirits of *jiǎ* and *yǐ* to descend upon this diagram and guard my form. I beseech the Southern Great Unity, Victorious First, Lesser Auspice, Vermilion Emperor, and the great spirits of *bǐng* and *dīng* to descend upon this diagram. I beseech the Western Transmitting Messenger, Following Chief, White Emperor, and the great spirits of *gēng* and *xīn* to descend upon this diagram. I beseech the Northern Ascending Brightness, Divine Successor, Great Auspice, Black Emperor, and the great spirits of *rén* and *guǐ* to descend upon this diagram."*

Once the four directions are invoked, place the first counting rod on the current day’s cyclical sign. The first rod is placed on *zǐ*, the second on *chǒu*, the third on *yín*, the fourth on *mǎo*, the fifth on *chén*, and the sixth on *sì*. Where two branches flank a stem, the first becomes the Heavenly Gate, and the latter becomes the Earthly Door. On the four *jiǎ* days, the Earthly Door does not form; instead, take the first rod and place it on the seventh position, *wǔ*, to naturally complete the Earthly Door. Step back slightly and recite the incantation, manipulating the rods and chanting the calculations:

*"The Rat wanders astray, entering the Dog Market."*
Move the rod from *zǐ* to *xū* and cry, *"Azure Dragon, descend!"*

*"The Ox eats the Hare’s Fungus; the Hare grazes on Sweetgrass."*
Move the rod from *chǒu* to *mǎo* and cry, *"Vermilion Bird, descend!"*

*"The Fierce Tiger advances, circling into *sì*."*
Move the rod from *yín* to *sì* and cry, *"Curved Array, descend!"*

*"The Hare enters the Ox Pen and does not rise."*
Move the rod from *mǎo* to *chǒu* and cry, *"White Tiger, descend!"*

*"The Dragon enters the Horse Stable and lingers above."*
Move the rod from *chén* to *wǔ* and cry, *"Dark Warrior, descend!"*

*"The Coiling Serpent winds its way into *shēn*."*
Move the rod from *sì* to *shēn* and cry, *"Six Harmonies, descend!"*

*"The Horse enters the Dragon Spring to drink sweet water."*
Move the rod from *wǔ* to *chén*.

*"The Chicken and Sheep exchange places, coming into *yǒu*."*
Move the rod from *wèi* to *yǒu*.

*"The Gibbon crawls northward toward the Swine."*
Move the rod from *shēn* to *hài*.

*"The Chicken flies and falls into the Sheep Pen."*
Move the rod from *yǒu* to *wèi*.

*"The Dog enters the Rat’s Burrow to embrace its young."*
Move the rod from *xū* to *zǐ*.

*"The Boar enters the Tiger’s Lair and meets its doom."*
Move the rod from *hài* to *yín*.

Recite the incantation:
*"Revered *Qián* shines with spirit; *Kūn* follows its inner workings.
The Two Modes harmonize; the Six Harmonies prosper in uprightness.
Matching Heaven and Earth, eternal peace and solemn clarity reign.
Responding to the Mysterious Yellow, above is the robe, below the skirt.
*Zhèn*, *lí*, *kūn*, *duì*—flourishing, they assist and uphold.
*Qián*, *kǎn*, *gèn*, *xùn*—tiger steps and dragon soars.
Today, as I manipulate the rods, the Jade Maiden attends beside me.
Those who pursue me shall die; those who seize me shall perish.
The Herdboy and Weaver Girl transform into the Jiang and He Rivers.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

On a *zǐ* day, stand in the forward position of the eight stems. On the four *zǐ* days, the Jade Maiden follows from *gēng*, cycling endlessly; mount her and depart.

When departing, recite the incantation, calling upon the Jade Maiden’s location. If she is on *gēng*, invoke:
*"Jade Maiden on *gēng*, swiftly come to protect me. Let no evil ghosts assail me; let no one see me. Should they see me, let them mistake me for a bundle of firewood. Open only my door, and close the doors of others."*
Once the incantation is complete, close the door and depart.

For those traveling far to meet nobles, ascend to office, or assume a post, exit through the Earthly Door and enter the Heavenly Gate, riding the Jade Maiden. Recite the incantation:
*"Heavenly Gate, Heavenly Gate, today is most auspicious.
The Jade Maiden attends me, roaming left and right beside me.
Roaming in all four directions, I encounter no misfortune.
Should a nobleman see me, his joy shall be unbounded.
All I seek shall be as I wish; all affairs shall prosper.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

For matters of entering battle formations, ambushing chariots, evading troops, fleeing calamity, concealing oneself, or attending inauspicious funerary rites, exit through the Heavenly Gate, enter the Earthly Door, and depart riding the Jade Maiden. Recite the incantation:
*"Nuo nuo yi yi, travel without choosing the day, return without choosing the hour. Follow the Dipper into the door, roaming with the spirits. Heaven and earth overturn; all desires in the heart shall be as you wish. Cause those who see you to be confounded, mistaking east for west, south for north. Those who know me shall not be able to reckon or bar my way as I depart."*

Recite the Jade Maiden incantation:
*"Jade Maiden, Jade Maiden, mother of the heavenly spirits. Protect me, guard me, and attend me as two. As I journey to such-and-such a village, may all be shrouded in darkness. Let no one see me; though gods and ghosts may hear my voice, let none perceive my form. Those who favor me shall know fortune; those who harm me shall meet misfortune. A hundred evil ghosts and bandits who oppose me shall perish. Among a thousand myriad people, those who see me shall rejoice. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Draw upon the earth with a blade as follows:
*"Statute and ordinance, statute and ordinance—four vertical, five horizontal. Ten thousand ghosts conceal their forms; I depart amidst the crowd. He who scolds me shall die; he who rebukes me shall perish; he who harms me shall suffer his own misfortune. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

**Twelve Divisions of Heavenly Gates, Earthly Doors, and Jade Maidens (Instantly Established)**

| Established Day | Heavenly Gate | Earthly Door | Jade Maiden | | Established Day | Heavenly Gate | Earthly Door | Jade Maiden |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| *Zǐ*            | *Bǐng*        | *Yǐ*         | *Gēng*      | | *Wǔ*            | *Rén*         | *Xīn*        | *Jiǎ*       |
| *Tiān Mén*      | *Dì Hù*       | *Yù Nǚ*      |             | | *Tiān Mén*      | *Dì Hù*       | *Yù Nǚ*      |             |
| *Chǒu*          | *Bǐng*        | *Yǐ*         | *Xīn*       | | *Wèi*          | *Rén*         | *Xīn*        | *Yǐ*        |
| *Yín*           | *Bǐng*        | *Yǐ*         | *Qián*      | | *Shēn*         | *Rén*         | *Jiǎ*        | *Xùn*       |

**Mǎo** | *Gēng* | *Dīng* | *Rén* | **Yǒu** | *Jiǎ* | *Guǐ* | *Bǐng*
**Chén** | *Gēng* | *Dīng* | *Guǐ* | **Xū** | *Jiǎ* | *Guǐ* | *Dīng*
**Sì** | *Gēng* | *Rén* | *Gèn* | **Hài** | *Jiǎ* | *Bǐng* | *Kūn*

This method, if not performed with reverent devotion and sincere invocation, will fail to summon the spirits with focus, and the incantations and calculations will yield no efficacy.

**Names of the Ten Celestial Stems at the Gates**
*Master Wáng Zhāng* states: The names of the gate and door spirits are essential for swift military movements and should also be employed for all entries and exits.

**Names of the Gate Spirits:**
- In the *jiǎzǐ* cycle: The door is named *Gōngsūn Qí*, the gate *Xú Yì*; they depart by removing their sandals.
- In the *jiǎxū* cycle: The door is named *Xú Hé*, the gate *Tiān Kě Shì*; they depart with an upward call.
- In the *jiǎshēn* cycle: The door is named *Shí Zhàn*, the gate *Sīmǎ Guāng*; they depart by removing their crowns.
- In the *jiǎwǔ* cycle: The door is named *Yú Kě*, the gate *Shí Zhòng*; they depart by shedding their garments and shaking them vigorously.
- In the *jiǎchén* cycle: The door is named *Sīmǎ Shèng*, the gate *Gōngsūn Cuò*; they depart by loosening and retying their hair.
- In the *jiǎyín* cycle: The door is named *Sīmǎ Qiáng*, the gate *Gōngsūn Guāng*; they depart by unfastening their belts.

When generals and troops move, regardless of distance, they must reach their destination by the method of six. In urgent situations, the commander arrays the soldiers, and they enter the *Tàiyīn* (Greater Yin) in a leftward rotation, calling upon the names of the gate and door spirits.

**Incantation:**
*"So-and-so is in peril. Aid me, conceal me, hide me. Let no enemy strike me, overthrow me, or overwhelm me. May the five weapons all shatter; those who oppose me shall die, those who gaze upon me shall perish. Even if the enemy is present, let them be shrouded in darkness and silence, their vision confounded, their souls disordered by my troops. Let the enemy dare not rise!"*

Upon completing the incantation, order the soldiers to proceed straight ahead in a leftward turn, taking care not to look back, and conceal themselves in the *liù guǐ*. The *liù guǐ* refers to the following: for example, in the *jiǎzǐ* cycle, the *liù guǐ* is at *yǒu*.

**Method for Traveling a Thousand *Lǐ* When Exiting the Gate**
The Nine Chapters of the Six *Jiǎ*, heaven is round and earth is square.
The four seasons and five phases, the sun and moon provide light.
The *Yǔ* step opens the path, *Chīyóu* averts warfare.
The Azure Dragon supports the wheel, the White Tiger attends the tally.
The *Yínghuò* (Mars) leads the way, dispelling misfortune.
The Northern Dipper executes punishment, eliminating calamity.
The five spirits follow me, circling the four directions.
Those who face me shall die, those who oppose me shall perish.
To my left, the altars of soil; to my right, the altars of grain—bandits and thieves shall hide.
Travelers shall rejoice, those who remain shall be blessed.
May the spirits protect me, and all my needs be fulfilled.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

**Yǔ Steps for the Three Auspicious Gates**
- Exiting the *liù yǐ* gate, perform the *Yǔ* step thrice and recite: *"The White Tiger clears the path; come forth before me. Take care not to await virtuous affairs—come swiftly to my aid!"*
- Exiting the *liù bǐng* gate, perform the *Yǔ* step and recite: *"The Celestial Stem displays its might; follow the Azure Dragon and White Tiger. All celestial bandits and captives who dare not comply shall be subdued by the Heavenly Axe!"*
- Exiting the *liù dīng* gate, perform the *Yǔ* step and recite: *"Jade Maiden, divine mother, call forth and face her. The Dao lies where it should; follow the Dipper’s handle into its bowl. The Clear Cold Spring and divine herbs—pluck them to conceal your form. Take care not to look back!"*

When employing the Three Auspicious Gates, if matters are urgent and there is no time to recite the incantation, focus your mind and trust in it—efficacy will follow. Take care not to look back.

**The True Person’s Yǔ Steps and Dipper Stem**
The scripture states: *"Stepping the Dipper with the Celestial One can communicate with the spirits."* One should stand beneath the stars at midnight, using white chalk to draw the nine stars of the Dipper, with three *chǐ* between each star. Begin the *Yǔ* steps from *Tiānchēng*, following the sequence. Stand before the *Kuí* (Dipper’s bowl) and step backward, facing *Tiānyīng* directly while singing the *Dǒu Jīng*.

Upon reciting up to *Tiānyīng*, stand on the right foot, call the star’s name, and step according to the scripture, alternating left and right feet. After a hundred days of practice, one will commune with the spirit persons. This is secret—do not transmit it to the unworthy.

**Song:**
The Dipper is wondrous, with the twelve celestial stems.
It bears radiance, arraying martial might.
Its qi-topknot billows like floating clouds.
The seven origins transform, bringing fortune and misfortune.
By the pitch-pipes, it governs weapons and troops.
Tread *Tiānyīng*, cross *Tiānrèn*.
The Clear Cold Spring can submerge the land.
Uproot the *Tiānzhù*, embrace the *Tiānxīn*.
Repeat this crossing, ascend *Tiānqín*.
Lean on *Tiānfǔ*, gaze at *Tiānchōng*.
Enter *Tiānpéng*, exit *Tiānruì*.
The Dipper’s Dao is traversed, emerging in hardness and softness.
Enter the dark depths, for a thousand myriad years.

After completing the Dipper steps, recite the incantation:
The Nine Chapters of the Six *Jiǎ*, heaven is round and earth is square.
The four seasons and five phases, azure, red, white, and yellow.
The *Tàiyǐ* is the master, the sun and moon provide light.
The *Yǔ* step opens the path, *Chīyóu* averts warfare.
The Azure Dragon supports the wheel, the White Tiger attends the march.
The *Yínghuò* leads the way, sweeping away misfortune.
The Northern Dipper executes punishment, the pine removes calamity.
The five spirits guide me, circling the eight directions.
Those who face me shall die, those who oppose me shall perish.
To my left, the altars of soil; to my right, the altars of grain—bandits and thieves shall hide.
Travelers shall rejoice, those who remain shall be blessed.
The myriad spirits protect me, forever free from thieves.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

**Six Jiǎ Yin Talismans**
- In the *jiǎzǐ* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīngmǎo*, its spirit has the head of a rabbit and a human body.
- In the *jiǎxū* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīngchǒu*, its spirit has the head of an ox and a human body.
- In the *jiǎshēn* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīnghài*, its spirit has the head of a boar and a human body.
- In the *jiǎwǔ* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīngyǒu*, its spirit has the head of a rooster and a human body.
- In the *jiǎchén* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīngwèi*, its spirit has the head of a sheep and a human body.
- In the *jiǎyín* cycle, the *yīn* talisman is at *dīngsì*, its spirit has the head of a snake and a human body.

After drawing the talisman, place it in a brocade pouch and have the commander carry it. During battle, take out the talisman of the current cycle and point it at the enemy from the pouch—the enemy will crumble of their own accord.

When selecting wood, first observe purification rites. Prepare one *dou* of wine and three cuts of venison. For the libation ritual, use white cogon grass as a mat. Face north, bow twice, and recite the incantation:

*"Ancestors of the thorn and bramble, spirits of the hundred ghosts,
Once you roamed with so-and-so—I now summon you to wander with me.
Yin of the Six Jia, spirits of the hundred ghosts,
Wander with me, transform my body.
Those who wander with you shall know no defiance."*

Solemnly offer the pure wine and fine meat as sacrifice. After the offering, bow twice and recite the incantation three times. Once complete, fell the tree, ensuring it is not defiled or tainted by the Five Pungent Foods. Then inscribe the talisman.

On a *liùjiǎ* day at midnight, perform the libation ritual again, ensuring no one witnesses it. For the transmission ritual, observe purification rites for five days: bathe in purity, maintain a clear mind, and focus on a single intent while inscribing the talisman. On a *liùjiǎ* day at midnight, perform the libation on an altar. One to two *chi* beyond the altar, arrange the twelve earthly branches in their respective directions. Use bamboo rods, each three *chi* long, to mark the directions according to their corresponding colors on the altar.

Place the *liùjiǎ* talismans on the altar, arranging them by position with five-colored silks, each three *chi* and five *cun* long, laid beneath them in the six directions. Offer two cups of wine, three cuts of meat, and one cup of salt in each direction. Face *gēng*, bow and kneel, invoking the Four Hall Lords of the directions, the yin spirits of the Six Jia, and the guardians of gates and thresholds.

Each talisman should be nine *cun* long, two *cun* wide, and two *fēn* thick. For example, on a *jiǎzǐ* day, the yin spirit talisman resides in *mǎo*. Bow twice, call the spirit’s name, and recite the incantation. Store the talisman in a stitched pouch. During battle, point the talisman of the current cycle at the enemy from the pouch, and they will submit in fear.

If time is pressing and no altar is prepared, sketch a makeshift altar for the ritual—it will still prove effective.

**Method for Dispelling Ill Winds While Marching**
The *Dùnjiǎ* states: When marching and encountering an ill wind, lay the banner pole flat. Mold a clay figurine seven *cun* tall from earth taken from the four corners of the camp. Have it hold a peachwood bow and reed arrows. Then, wielding a peachwood blade, face the wind with unbound hair. Strike your teeth three times and recite the incantation:

*"Heaven has Four Candles to guard the four borders.
I have Four Hounds to guard the four yang.
Let the city be a mountain, the land a river.
No raiders may pass, no invaders advance, no retreaters depart.
Thus shall evil perish, and the wind cease."*

**The Jade Maiden’s Reversal and Concealment**
The Jade Maiden is the true spirit of Heaven and Earth. Accompanied by the Green Dragon, Hall of Light, and Great Yin, she attends to affairs, traversing the space between Heaven and Earth, transforming endlessly to bring benefit and dispel harm. She also grants concealment to those who invoke her.

*Guǐgǔzǐ* states:
- On *dīngmǎo*, the Jade Maiden conceals one’s body.
- On *dīngsì*, she conceals one’s life.
- On *dīngwèi*, she conceals one’s spirit.
- On *dīngyǒu*, she conceals one’s soul.
- On *dīnghài*, she conceals one’s fortune.
- On *dīngchǒu*, she conceals one’s spirit.

To conceal oneself, follow the Green Dragon and others to the place of the Six Ding—your form will vanish of its own accord.

**Method for Serving the Jade Maiden**
On *jiǎ* and *dīng* days, observe purification rites. Before rising from bed in the morning, face *xū* while dressing, then sit toward the Jade Maiden’s position. Recite the Jade Maiden’s incantation and chant her name thirty-six times. Before retiring at night, stand and recite it thirty-six times again. Practice this for thirty-six days, and all matters of fortune or misfortune, gain or loss, will be foretold three days in advance.

The scripture states: To perform the Jade Maiden’s Reversal and Concealment, on a Six Ding day, reverently enshrine the names and talismans of the Six Ding Jade Maidens in a purified chamber. Recite the incantation six times, burn incense, and bow twice. Thereafter, invoke and summon them—they will respond without fail.

- The *dīngmǎo* Jade Maiden is named Kǒng Línxuán, styled Zú Rìzhī, with a voice like reeds whispering in the wind.
- The *dīngchǒu* Jade Maiden is named Liáng Qiūshū, styled Yuán Shàngtiān, with a voice like the cry of a sacrificial ox.
- The *dīnghài* Jade Maiden is named Líng Chénglù, styled Fā Míngjí, with a voice like action unfolding.
- The *dīngyǒu* Jade Maiden is named Fèi Yángduō, styled Jiù Qīnlíng, with a voice like a flock of crows cawing at night.
- The *dīngwèi* Jade Maiden is named Wáng Qūqí, who rides purple clouds, with a voice like beasts entering a city.
- The *dīngsì* Jade Maiden is named Xǔ Wēichí, styled Zhū Fúchēng, with a voice like leaping springs.

**Incantation for the Chamber Ritual:**
*"Six Ding Jade Maidens, be my companions,
Pierce the hidden, penetrate the true—
All I desire shall come to pass.
Know all matters before they arise,
Never break your oath.
Sealed in blood, we are bound as one.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!"*

Knowing the Six Ding, one may emerge from darkness and enter shadow without fear. For a thousand years unshaken, for ten thousand years untoppled. Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Daily Departure Incantation:**
Heaven and earth overturn, the nine paths all sealed.
Should any pursue me, let them be lost and confused here.
Let east become west, let south become north.
Those who come by chariot—break their twin axles.
Those who come by horse—cover their eyes.
Those who come on foot—swell their feet.
Those who come with weapons raised—make them submit themselves.
Bright Star and Northern Dipper, repel enemies a thousand miles.
Let pursuers perish, let seekers halt.
Oxherd and Weaver Girl, transform into rivers and seas.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Four Directions to Avoid in Warfare:**
In spring, do not wage war or mobilize arms toward the east—for this is spring’s flourishing, and to strike here invites defeat.
In summer, do not wage war or mobilize arms toward the south—this is called "striking the strong," and even if not defeated, one will be wounded.
In autumn, do not wage war or mobilize arms toward the west.
In winter, do not raise arms or engage the enemy toward the north—this is called "striking unto death," and one should instead retreat before turning to battle.

**Determining Auspicious Directions by the Eight Nodal Points:**
After the Beginning of Spring, face northwest in battle.
At the Spring Equinox, face due north in battle.
At the Beginning of Summer, face due east in battle.
At the Summer Solstice, face due east in battle.
After the Beginning of Autumn, face southeast in battle.
At the Autumn Equinox, face due south in battle.
After the Beginning of Winter, face southwest in battle.
At the Winter Solstice, facing southwest is auspicious.

**Li Pushe’s Method of the Solitary and Void:**
The year’s solitary position lies two stems behind the Grand Year.
The month’s solitary position lies two stems behind the monthly establishment.
The day’s solitary position lies two stems behind the daily stem.
The opposing position is the void.
Alternatively, among the sixty days of the flowering stems, even-numbered positions are solid, odd-numbered positions are solitary, and absent positions are void.
Or, when the Dipper aligns with the hour, the yang solitary position is at *zi*, and the yin solitary position is at *yin*.
For departures, seeking wealth, or divining battle: turning one’s back to the solid and facing the void brings good fortune.
Without solid positions, use the void—either the Green Dragon’s domain or the abodes of celestial and noble spirits. Turn from life toward death, and in departures, seeking wealth, and all matters, there will be unimpeded success.
Always take left as east and right as west, facing east with the body toward the north.
In commanding armies: for ten thousand men, use the year’s solitary position; for a thousand, the month’s; for a hundred, the day’s—apply accordingly.
Examine and employ with care, and good fortune will surely follow.
The later sections of the original text are fragmented, and this talisman is no longer in use. How to employ it shall be reconsidered if a complete version is later found.

*Thus concludes the fourth scroll of the* Taishang Liuren Mingjian Fuyin Jing.
