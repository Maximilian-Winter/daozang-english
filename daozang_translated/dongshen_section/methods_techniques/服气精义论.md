**The Essentials of Qi Absorption**
*Recorded by the White Cloud Master of Tiantai*

Qi is the subtle and minute manifestation of the Dao. When the subtle stirs and the minute is activated, the One arises—thus the Primordial Unity is complete within the Supreme Simplicity.

The One is the tranquil and congealed essence of the Dao. When tranquility transforms and congealment creates, the Two emerge—thus Heaven and Earth divide within the Supreme Ultimate. Thereby, form and body are established; the myriad things share in their endowment, and spirit becomes manifest. All phenomena receive this in equal measure. Among the forms of things, only humans are upright; among the essences of phenomena, only humans are numinous. They unite Heaven and Earth, occupying the position of the Three Powers; they harmonize yin and yang, embodying the finest of the Five Phases. Thus, they can communicate with the mysterious and descend the sagely, refine their substance to ascend as immortals, conceal their radiance to enter the void, and attain the wondrous through the mind of non-being—this is the method of immortal ascension.

The methods of immortal ascension are manifold, yet the subtlest principle converges in one path. Some refine elixirs and consume potions, their efficacy ascending and soaring; others observe precepts and cultivate inwardly, their merit perfected in transcendence. However, mineral medicines are costly and difficult to obtain, while the labor of practice spans years and easily strays. If one seeks swift efficacy and dedicated accomplishment, aligning with the Dao through emptiness and harmonizing virtue with the divine, none surpasses the wondrousness of qi!

The Yellow Emperor said: "Those who eat grain are clever but short-lived; those who consume qi are spiritually attuned and long-lived; those who eat nothing do not die." The Perfected One said: "What endures in the Dao is nurturing life; what allows one to wander eternally is absorbing qi. When qi is whole, life persists, and only then can one cultivate the will. Cultivating the will aligns with the real, and only then can one dwell long in the realm of vital qi. How can one not diligently pursue this?"

Thus, one draws in the morning mist and rinses with the frost’s essence, nourishing the radiance of the five viscera and guiding the constructive and defensive qi through the hundred

The north direction is black in color, entering and connecting with the kidneys, opening at the two yin orifices, and manifesting in the body as bones.

Moreover, the lungs serve as the first floral canopy among the five viscera. The lungs reside above the heart, facing the chest, with six lobes, their color like white silk suffused with red. The lung channel emerges from the Shaoyang. It begins at the inner side of the tip of the thumb, approximately two *fen* from the corner of the nail, in the depression there.

The heart lies below the lungs and above the liver, opposite the point one *cun* below the xiphoid process. Its color is like white silk suffused with crimson. The heart channel emerges from the *Zhongchong* point, located at the tip of the middle finger, approximately two *fen* from the corner of the nail, in the depression there.

The liver is situated slightly behind and below the heart. It has four lobes on the right and three on the left, its color like white silk suffused with dark red. The liver channel emerges from the *Dadun* point, at the tip of the big toe, in the midst of the three hairs.

The spleen directly covers the area above the navel, lying transversely over the stomach in front. Its color is like white silk suffused with purple. The spleen channel emerges from the *Yinbai* point, at the side of the tip of the big toe, the width of a leek leaf from the corner of the nail.

The left and right kidneys face the front opposite the navel, broadly attached to the lumbar spine. Their color is like white silk suffused with purple. The left is the true kidney, corresponding to the five viscera. The right is the *Mingmen* (Gate of Life), where men store essence and women bind the womb. The kidney channel emerges at the *Yongquan* point, in the depression at the center of the sole of the foot.

For those who ingest the qi of the Five Sprouts, it is fitting to visualize the qi entering their respective viscera, ensuring the fluids flow smoothly, each according to its governance. This not only allows the qi to circulate throughout the body but also enables the treatment of illnesses.

When ingesting the green sprout, visualize the qi entering the liver, seeing the green qi billowing and the green fluid merging distinctly. After a while, perceive the qi at the *Dadun* point of the foot. With continued practice, the qi will ascend, converging within the channels, dispersing through all the vessels, and rising to connect with the eyes.

When ingesting the qi of the other directions, it is still advisable to bathe, rinse the mouth, don proper attire, and enter a separate chamber after the hour of *chou* (1–3 a.m.). There, burn incense, sit facing the respective direction, calm the mind, and focus the intention to proceed.

**On Ingesting Qi**

Qi is the origin of the embryo and the root of form. Once the embryo is born, the original essence scatters; once the form moves, its fundamental substance gradually deteriorates. Therefore, one must draw in qi to congeal essence and preserve qi to refine the form. When essence is full, spirit is whole; when the form is at rest, life is prolonged. When the original root is replete, one can firmly endure.

Observe all things: there is nothing that has qi yet lacks form, nor anything that has form yet lacks qi. O seeker of life preservation, how can you not focus on qi to attain suppleness?

The **Taiqing Qi-Conducting Talisman** is to be written facing the king and swallowed when intending to ingest qi and abstain from grains. Swallow one talisman every seven days, ceasing after twenty-one days. Prepare three talismans in total, burning incense on both sides.

Before ingesting qi, one should first treat any bodily ailments, ensuring the viscera and bowels are unobstructed and the limbs are at ease. Even without prior illnesses, one must take medicine to eliminate phlegm and fluids. Assess the body’s cold and heat, take one or two doses to purge and cleanse the intestines and stomach, removing accumulated stagnation. The formulas for vomiting and purging follow later. After convalescing and recovering, then observe a hundred-day purification, cultivating purity of conduct. During this period, gradually reduce sour and salty flavors, strictly avoiding rich tastes. It is best to take *fuling* (poria), steamed and dried sesame, and other medicines to prepare for grain abstention.

At the beginning of ingesting qi, do not abruptly cease all medicines and foods. Instead, daily reduce medicines and foods while gradually increasing qi and fluids. Once the qi’s flow is smooth and the body and viscera are stable, one may then cease all medicines and foods. Still, one should continue with ointments and supplements, avoiding hard, astringent, stagnating, cold, or slippery foods.

In winter, when the intestines and stomach feel entirely empty, without hunger or thirst, adjust the regimen as one sees fit—this cannot be fully described here.

It is advisable to begin during the spring or autumn, between the third and eighth day of the lunar month. Choose an auspicious day to start, first ingesting the **Taiqing Qi-Conducting Talisman**. By the appointed day, swallow three talismans, then enter a secluded chamber. The eastern side of the chamber should not be obstructed, and it is best if the morning light shines directly. Open a window on the eastern wall so that the midday sunlight shines directly onto the face.

After midnight (*zi* hour, 11 p.m.–1 a.m.), first untie the hair and comb it several hundred times, then let it hang loose behind. This is necessary at the beginning; later, it is no longer required to leave the hair loose.

Burn incense, but do not use frankincense. Sit facing east, calm the mind, focus the thoughts, and perform the knocking of teeth and guiding exercises. The method is detailed in the following section.

Then, sit quietly and regulate the breath before lying down with the head to the west. The original text states to lie with the head to the east, but facing west is more convenient for visualization and absorption. The bedding should be thick and warm, adjusted to a comfortable temperature, slightly warm being best. The lower back and feet should be especially warm. The pillow should be low, level with the back, so that the head and neck align straight with the body.

Loosen the clothing and belt, allowing space. Extend the hands about three *cun* from the body, make fists, and spread the feet about five or six *cun* apart. Slowly exhale to regulate the breath.

Then visualize the qi of the rising sun in the east, merging with the sunlight into a cinnabar-purple radiance. Draw this light to the front of the face. First, pinch the hairs in the nostrils with the thumb and index finger, then press and move the nose up and down on both sides ten times to ensure smoothness. Gently inhale and swallow.

With prolonged practice, one need not consciously inhale; simply visualize the qi and swallow, and the qi will enter naturally—this is the subtlety. After swallowing three times, the qi enters the lungs. Part the lips slightly and exhale slowly.

Each person’s breath has its own rhythm; adjust naturally. Do not forcefully draw the breath to its extreme, as this will cause qi to rush and lead to harm.

After three inhalations and swallows, if the breath is long, increase to five or six, or even seven, which is especially good.

When this practice brings a sensation of the lungs expanding and filling to their fullest, cease swallowing and hold the breath, visualizing the qi within the lungs. Let it flow with the shoulders into the arms, reaching the hands; clasp the hands and hold the visualization as the qi descends into the stomach, then to the kidneys, and follows the viscera down to the soles of the feet—until the skin and flesh tingle as if traversed by insects. Once this is complete, allow a gentle panting, then wait briefly until the breath settles. Resume the method of drawing and swallowing, guiding the qi until the hands and feet feel warm, harmonious, and unobstructed.

Most qi-absorption methods direct the qi straight into the abdomen without first circulating it through the limbs, which can cause coldness in the extremities and stagnation in the five viscera. Thus, one must first guide the qi into the four limbs before allowing it to enter the abdomen, so that it flows naturally and spreads freely. After this, there is no need to retain the qi in the lungs; simply draw it directly into the large and small intestines, swirling and circulating it until it reaches below the navel. Continue until the intestines feel full, then stop.

Next, press the knees firmly together, clench the fists tightly, and hold the breath to distend the abdomen nine times. During each distension, visualize the qi dispersing throughout the body. When the urge to exhale becomes intense, release the breath slowly. Take care not to strain or force the breath; instead, exhale gradually in measured intervals. If the abdomen feels slightly expanded, cease at once. If it remains tense and full, hold the breath and distend it again. Once finished, stretch the legs and rub the face with the hands, then stroke downward from the chest, repeating this several dozen times. Also, massage the abdomen around the navel several dozen times. Extend the toes upward, arch the back several times, then relax the hands and limbs, forgetting the mind and relinquishing the form. After a long while, wait until the breath and joints settle into harmony. Then rise. If perspiration appears, dust the head, face, and neck with powder, sit upright, and gently move the joints until the body feels at ease and normal before standing.

In this practice, one may adapt flexibly to circumstances, applying various methods as needed. Since it is impossible to enumerate every detail, one should skillfully adjust with intention. Why must the qi first pause in the lungs, enter the stomach, and reach the kidneys? The lungs are the root of qi. All qi belongs to the lungs, and the qi of heaven communicates with them. Moreover, the lungs govern the viscera, serving as their canopy, the source of breath, and the regulator of transmission and governance. The *po* gate acts as the messenger of the five viscera and the master of the four, connecting to the twelve meridians in an endless cycle—hence its role as the messenger of the five viscera. Thus, the qi must first pause in the lungs before flowing onward.

The stomach is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels, where all water and grain enter. It is the great master of the six bowels, and the five viscera and six bowels all depend on it. The five flavors enter the stomach and each returns to its respective organ to nourish the five qi. Therefore, the qi of the five viscera and six bowels all originate from the stomach and manifest in the *qi* mouth. The kidneys are the source of generative qi, the root of the five viscera and six bowels, and the foundation of the twelve meridians. The left is the true kidney, and the right is the *mingmen*. Thus, guiding the qi to the kidneys replenishes their essence and fluids.

Heaven nourishes humans with the five qi, and earth nourishes them with the five flavors. The five qi enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs, while the five flavors enter through the mouth and are stored in the intestines and stomach. Once the flavors are stored, they harmonize with the five qi to generate life. When fluids and qi interact, spirit arises naturally. The five flavors are not solely derived from grains, for the five qi themselves contain their own flavors. When supplemented with medicinal herbs—whose five flavors surpass those of grains—this becomes even more potent. Though this discussion focuses on the lungs and kidneys, the qi naturally circulates through all the viscera. Thus it is said: exhalation issues from the heart and lungs, inhalation draws in the kidneys and liver, and between exhalation and inhalation, the spleen receives its nourishment. This is the principle of breath and the essence of spirit and qi.

The *Most High* once asked: "Upon what does human life depend?" Someone replied: "Upon the space between exhalation and inhalation." The *Most High* said: "Excellent! This may truly be called the Dao."

In all qi-absorption practices, one should select the period from the hour of *chou* (1–3 a.m.) to before noon. From the cock’s crow to dawn is the *yin* of Heaven, the *yang* within *yin*; from dawn to midday is the *yang* of Heaven, the *yang* within *yang*; from midday to dusk is the *yang* of Heaven, the *yin* within *yang*; from dusk to the cock’s crow is the *yin* of Heaven, the *yin* within *yin*. The human body follows the same pattern.

Moreover, in spring, *qi* flows through the channels and collaterals; in summer, it flows through the muscles; in autumn, it flows through the skin; and in winter, it flows through the bones and marrow.

In the first and second months, Heaven’s *qi* is aligned, Earth’s *qi* begins to rise, and the human *qi* resides in the liver. In the third and fourth months, Heaven’s *qi* is aligned, Earth’s *qi* is fully risen, and the human *qi* resides in the spleen. In the fifth and sixth months, Heaven’s *qi* is abundant, Earth’s *qi* is high, and the human *qi* resides in the head. In the seventh and eighth months, *yin* *qi* begins to wane, and the human *qi* resides in the lungs. In the ninth and tenth months, *yin* *qi* begins to freeze, Earth’s *qi* begins to close, and the human *qi* resides in the heart. In the eleventh and twelfth months, the *qi* of ice returns, Earth’s *qi* converges, and the human *qi* resides in the kidneys.

For each season’s months, one should follow the *qi*’s flow and harmonize with it. In all qi-absorption practices, the best time is when the sky is clear and bright. If it is windy, rainy, overcast, or foggy, one must not inhale external *qi*; instead, enter a secluded chamber, close the doors, and absorb *qi*, supplementing with various medicinal herbs.

For those who practice qi-absorption and abstain from grains: after ten days, essence and *qi* weaken, and the complexion becomes sallow. After twenty days, movement causes dizziness, limbs ache, bowel movements are difficult, urine is dark yellow, and sometimes there is diarrhea with hard stool followed by loose stool. After thirty days, the body becomes emaciated, and walking feels heavy and labored. The preceding signs of weakness are caused by the initial practice of concentrating *qi*; if medicinal herbs are used, these symptoms will not occur.

After forty days, the complexion gradually brightens, and the mind and spirit are at peace. After fifty days, the five viscera harmonize, and essence and *qi* are internally nourished. After sixty days, the body returns to its former state, and the joints move smoothly. After seventy days, the mind dislikes noise and disturbance, and aspirations soar. After eighty days, one becomes serene and tranquil, and faith in the method grows clearer. After ninety days, one’s complexion becomes lustrous, and the voice becomes strong and resonant. After a hundred days, all the proper and black *qi* arrive, and the effects reach their peak. If practice continues without cease, lifespan will be extended.

After three years, scars disappear, and the complexion gains radiance. After six years, the marrow fills, the intestines transform into sinews, and one can foresee life and death. After nine years, one can command ghosts and spirits, jade maidens attend by one’s side, the brain is full, the face is plump, and one cannot be harmed—this is called a *zhenren* (Perfected Person).

**Method of Absorbing the Six *Wu* Qi**
At dawn, begin with the *jiazi* ten-day cycle, face the direction of *chen* (SE), touch the tongue to the upper and lower teeth, gather saliva, swirl it three times, and swallow once. Then face *yin* (NE), then *zi* (N), then *xu* (NW), then *shen* (W), and finally *wu* (S).

Another method: on the *jiazi* day, complete a ten-day cycle, always facing *wuchen* (SE) to swallow *qi*. On the *jiaxu* day, face *wuyin* (NE), and proceed similarly for the remaining cycles. This is the method of the six *wu*, a school’s teaching, as *wu* *qi* enters the spleen, which is the foundation of food and nourishment. This method alone can prevent hunger; if one seeks to benefit the entire body, it is not as effective as other methods.

**Method of Absorbing the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine Qi**
Slowly inhale *qi* through the nose, drawing in three breaths, then exhale dead *qi* once through the mouth. With prolonged practice, one can absorb three *qi*. Next, inhale five *qi* and exhale dead *qi* once; with prolonged practice, one can absorb five *qi*. Then inhale seven *qi* and exhale dead *qi* once; with prolonged practice, one can absorb seven *qi*. Then inhale nine *qi* and exhale dead *qi* once; with prolonged practice, one can absorb nine *qi*. Then combine the three, five, seven, and nine, inhaling twenty-four *qi* through the nose and exhaling dead *qi* once through the mouth; with prolonged practice, one can absorb twenty-four *qi*.

The method of reversing the count: begin from nine and descend to three, then ascend again, swallowing *qi* eighty-one times and exhaling once as a cycle. This method is most effective when the inhaled *qi* is abundant and the exhaled *qi* is minimal. If one does not follow this numerical limit and gradually increases the intake, it will deviate from the standard count.

*Dead qi* refers to the *qi* of the four seasons and five phases that are in decline or exhaustion. Visualize and exhale it; the rest of the procedure follows the usual method.

**Method of Nourishing the Five Viscera with the Five Phases’ Qi**
On the six *bing* days, at the hour of *si* (9–11 a.m.), ingest *qi* 120 times to assist the heart, enabling the heart to overcome the lungs and preventing the lungs from harming the liver—this is the principle of nourishing the liver.

On the six *wu* days, at the hour of *wei* (1–3 p.m.), ingest *qi* 120 times to assist the spleen, enabling the spleen to overcome the kidneys and preventing harm to the heart.

In late summer, on the six *geng* days, at the hour of *shen* (3–5 p.m.), ingest *qi* 120 times to assist the lungs, enabling the lungs to overcome the liver and preventing harm to the spleen.

In autumn, on the six *ren* days, at the hour of *hai* (9–11 p.m.), ingest *qi* 120 times to assist the kidneys, enabling the kidneys to overcome the heart and preventing harm to the lungs.

In winter, on the six *jia* days, at the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.), ingest *qi* 120 times to assist the liver, enabling the liver to overcome the spleen and preventing harm to the kidneys.

This method is the essential teaching of ingesting *qi* according to the five phases. Each season has nine such occasions, totaling 1,080 ingestions of *qi*, each nourishing its corresponding viscus. Cycle through them repeatedly without mutual overcoming, and practice with focused intention. This is the school’s teaching. The details regarding the five viscera are fully explained in the *Treatise on the Five Teeth*.
