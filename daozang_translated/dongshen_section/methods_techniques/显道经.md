**The Scripture of Revealing the Dao**

Laozi said: Man has five minds, and the face has five colors. When strength is robust and qi abundant, the flesh and skin are full. When bones surge, the face is white; when blood surges, the face is red; when marrow surges, the face is yellow; when flesh surges, the face is black; when essence surges, the face is radiant; when qi surges, the face is lustrous. Though their natures differ, hardness and softness are difficult to perfect. Some are wise, some are deluded; some are sincere and trustworthy, grasping the secrets of the Dao; others are violent and perverse, turning white to black, obscuring the Dao. Be cautious—do not transmit it to them.

Laozi said: Man has prosperity and decline, foretold in the body. At fifteen, the spirit resides in the cinnabar field. At twenty, essence and qi grow stronger. At thirty, vigor prevails. At forty, the spirit of the head wanes, and white hair appears. At fifty, the spirit of the eyes wanes, and their luster fades. At sixty, the spirit of the viscera wanes, and the five throats are harmed. At seventy, the spirit of the feet wanes, and movement becomes labored. At eighty, the yin spirit wanes, and the stem loses strength. A lifespan of one hundred and twenty is the heavenly span—those with the Dao transcend; those without meet misfortune. No need for distant worries that deplete the spirit. Calm the mind, guard tranquility, embrace emptiness and simplicity, and you become a true person.

Laozi said: The method of attaining the Dao is not singular in its transformations. Only the five viscera are where the Dao passes. The mysterious Dao has its root, standing in the Great Void. Taking non-action as its foundation, it cannot be lost or forsaken. The Dao has male and female, following one another without distinction. Its spirit is the hun-soul, uniting with the po-soul to transform into the red child. It nourishes the body’s bones, floating up and down, unobstructing the blood vessels. In decline, it finds no refuge; the spirit is not deluded. This is the Dao of essence—named "simplicity."

Laozi said: The Dao generates three divisions, each with its own name. Divided into the six bowels, they converge in the cinnabar field. They govern the hundred vessels, regulating yin and yang. With each inhalation and exhalation, there is death and life. Do not squander essence, lest the tally be lost. When the Dao is perfected in transformation, one ascends to the Great Mystery. The three unite as virtue, merging with heaven. Refining and returning the elixir is called "naturalness."

Laozi said: When first entering the chamber of the Dao, guard the Mysterious Origin. Within the mysterious lies the mysterious—this is my life. Within life lies life—this is my form. Within form lies form—this is my essence. Within essence lies essence—this is my qi. Within qi lies qi—this is my spirit. Within spirit lies spirit—this is my natural transformation into the Great Void. If one can preserve this, lifespan extends of itself.

Laozi said: Virtue uses form as its chariot; the Dao uses qi as its horse. The hun-soul takes essence as its root; the po-soul takes the eyes as its gate. When form moves, virtue scatters; when qi strays, the Dao rebels. When essence dissipates, the hun-soul is harmed; when the eyes move, the po-soul scatters. Thus, the sage stills the form, seals the breath, accumulates essence, and cherishes vision. Virtue and the Dao congeal, hun and po are firmly guarded. Form unites, spirit multiplies, the Dao is perfected in transformation, and one faces peril without fear. This is the great essential of your cultivation in attaining the Dao.

Laozi said: Those who unite with the Dao do not speak. Attaining the true without ornament, their hair flourishes. Grasping the root of the Dao, their hands and feet brim with qi, which does not leak day or night. The sun and moon merge their light; they neither hunger nor thirst. Like the tortoise and dragon, they practice embryonic breathing. In winter, they are warm; in summer, cool. The Daoist consumes the elixir of the mysterious, ascends to the Great Clarity, and returns to youth without aging. The Dao’s naturalness is not distant—it lies near, within one’s own body. In indistinctness, existence and non-existence intermingle; one conceals their form and hides their shadow. Permeating ten thousand miles, they observe the nine heavens. Holding the mind like water, life endures.

Laozi said: The method of transmitting the Dao must select the gentle and benevolent, those without violence or impatience, whose practice swiftly succeeds. Without talent or skill, through accumulated practice, they enter the spirit. Those who attain it transcend; those who lose it are harmed. At the slightest beginning, the mysterious Dao is profound and obscure. Driving a horse ten thousand miles without encountering a viewer, within the bones, none are alike. Simply cultivate the body and guard the Dao—the Dao will naturally return to you.

**Explanation of the Plain Dao**

Laozi said: When first entering the chamber of the Dao, on the day of breaking and removing, resolve the five transgressions and seven impurities. Bathe in flowing water, fast, and purify the body, so the five viscera are at peace, the mind and will are harmonious and content. Eliminate harm, abandon all affairs, embrace non-action and simplicity—then one may cultivate the Dao and clearly receive the master’s teachings.

Someone asked: When first entering the chamber of the Dao, should it be high, dry, and pure?
Laozi said: First place live charcoal in the chamber to dispel dampness. Ensure there are no insects or rats. Shake out the curtains, bedding, and mats to remove dust and grime. Burn incense day and night so the interior is fragrant. Do not allow vessels or objects, for their presence distracts the mind.

Someone asked: When first entering the Dao, should one fast?
Laozi said: First bathe for five days in orchid-scented water. When the body is dry and the hair is parched, with hunger and fullness balanced and essence and qi harmonious and joyful, then one may enter the chamber.

Someone asked: Does the Dao wish to hear the sounds of a hundred birds?
Laozi said: Always have people drive away flying birds and crows, and keep dogs at a distance. Let the neighbors be free of clamor, taking clarity and stillness as the foundation.

Someone asked: In practicing the Dao, do the hands and feet have fixed measurements?
Laozi said: Follow one’s intention to adjust them. Each has its own measure, not interfering with one another—this is called "simplicity."

Someone asked: Does the Dao’s pillow and mat have methods for height and lowness?
Laozi said: A high pillow contracts the liver; a low pillow sags the lungs. A four-inch pillow is level. The mat should be soft so the breath is long.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao externally, should one lie supine? Some cannot lie perfectly supine—what then?
Laozi said: Lying supine brings bodily ease, and the qi flows smoothly. Do not tilt or lean, bend or crouch.

Supine posture is the great method of the Dao.

Someone asked: When first practicing the Dao, the breath is untrained—one wishes to lengthen it, yet it shortens; wishes to disperse it, yet it quickens; wishes to retain it, yet it returns. What is to be done?
Laozi said: In the beginning, focus on clarity and stillness; do not force or prolong.

Someone asked: How does one verify when the breath arrives at the proper time?
Laozi said: When the qi first arrives, the intestines rumble, the pulse stirs, and the hands and feet ache—this is the effect of qi.

Someone asked: What occurs when the qi reaches the body?
Laozi said: As the qi reaches the body, the body gradually grows cold. If startled, calm the mind and steady the will; do not allow alarm, but let the qi act as it will.

Someone asked: From where does the Dao’s qi customarily exit and enter?
Laozi said: The qi emerges from the cinnabar field (dantian), which is the life gate of humans, the root of original qi. The five viscera receive it, and from it issue the radiance and essence of qi’s ingress and egress.

Someone asked: The Dao’s qi is born in the dantian—through which viscera does it exit and enter?
Laozi said: Exhalation enters the lungs and heart; inhalation enters the kidneys and liver. Exhalation and inhalation meet, converging at the great granary (taicang). The triple burner harmonizes and guides, restraining the hun and po souls. This is the natural qi, the life-prolonging Dao. Examine and practice it, and you will surely become a perfected person.

Someone asked: Does the practice of Dao and qi differ between day and night?
Laozi said: By day, store it in the qi府 (qi repository), by night, store it in the spirit palace. The qi repository is called the dantian; the spirit palace is called the Hall of Light. If by day one does not store it in the qi repository, the original qi will not circulate; if by night one does not store it in the spirit palace, the eyes will not perceive the spirit.

Someone asked: When the Dao’s qi has not yet arrived, if one feels the need to rise, move about, or grows weary, is this permissible?
Laozi said: If weary, one may rise and lie down at will. When the qi has not yet arrived, do not practice excessively.

Someone asked: Some can practice the Dao’s qi, while others cannot—why?
Laozi said: It depends on one’s constitution. Those with essence find the Dao easy; those without essence find it difficult. The key lies in focused concentration, and there is also an element of destiny.

Someone asked: Do men and women follow the same method in practicing the Dao’s qi?
Laozi said: A man with essence may attain qi in two or three days; a woman with essence may feel its circulation in four or five days, at which point she will perceive sights and sounds. These are the proofs of the Dao, the great effects of essence and qi.

Someone asked: Does the Dao differ between old and young?
Laozi said: The young find qi easy to circulate; the old find it difficult, requiring more time. Those with scant qi should rest.

Someone asked: Why does the Dao use a three-inch tally to prop the dantian?
Laozi said: When first practicing qi, one fears misdirecting the dantian, causing the qi to fail to flow. Thus, a tally is used to prop the dantian; lifting the tally allows the qi to reach that place.

Someone asked: When the dantian remains bright for a long time during practice, can one rely on this brightness without further effort?
Laozi said: With frequent brightness, the field will not wither or sever. Over time, the field will naturally become visible, shining like daylight, and the qi will arrive like surging clouds.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, may one wear light clothing?
Laozi said: At first, remove all clothing and lie unadorned, hands and feet at ease. If the coverlet is drawn away and the body does not grow cold, one need not fear later harm. Wearing light clothing is best.

Someone asked: After undressing for the Dao, may one rise?
Laozi said: When the hands and feet are settled and the qi is gathered like a drum, call an attendant to bring clothing, then rise. Walk and stretch, lifting the gathered qi—this is to cherish the qi and prevent its escape.

Someone asked: May one practice the Dao several times a day?
Laozi said: Practice the Dao three or four times a day. After a hundred days, the Dao will be accomplished, and one need not practice excessively, lest it steal one’s breath.

Someone asked: If one discontinues the Dao for a long time and then resumes, may one drink wine?
Laozi said: One may, though those who indulge excessively and neglect the Dao for long, then resume, will find the qi flows as before.

Someone asked: If one has no chamber, may one practice outdoors?
Laozi said: At first, practice in a chamber. After a hundred days, one may act freely, though nothing surpasses a secluded, pristine chamber.

Someone asked: What is the "light ascent" in the Dao? Does the body rise of its own accord in dreams?
Laozi said: With long practice of the Dao, the spirit is invigorated, and the body rises of itself—this is the Dao nearing completion.

Someone asked: If one seeks transcendence through the Dao, must one cease interaction with the world?
Laozi said: The world is full of desires, which scatter the mind. Enter the mountains and dwell in seclusion, guarding the will naturally. When merit is fulfilled and the form transforms, one attains longevity.

Someone asked: After the Dao is accomplished, may one enter the bedchamber?
Laozi said: Those who wish to become flying immortals and transcend the world must not enter the bedchamber. Those who do not seek transcendence may act freely after a hundred days.

Someone asked: May one practice the Dao in the dead of night?
Laozi said: It is forbidden. Night is the time of dead qi, when malevolent spirits roam. Day is the time of living qi; practice at cockcrow or dawn, when the sun rises, so the qi flows easily.

Someone asked: The Dao customarily begins at cockcrow—what of autumn and winter?
Laozi said: In spring and summer, begin at cockcrow or dawn; in autumn and winter, at sunrise or mealtime. The key is a secluded chamber and gentle warmth—timing matters little.

Someone asked: What strange things appear in the Dao?
Laozi said: After practicing the Dao for several tens of days, a white-haired old woman and a young girl may attend at one’s side, then suddenly vanish without a trace—these are the strange things.

Someone asked: If strange things appear during the Dao, should one move the hands and feet, speak recklessly, or close the eyes and contemplate the field?
Laozi said: Focus the mind single-mindedly, close the eyes and contemplate the field, and circulate the qi as usual. Do not fear or doubt. Over time, the strange things will cease of themselves.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, one constantly closes the eyes and contemplates the field—how can one see strange things?
Laozi said: If the mind is not focused and the will not settled, strange things appear. Do not consider them real, do not fear them, do not rise to attend to other matters, and do not speak to them. If you speak to them, they will take you away with them.

Someone asked: Before the Dao is attained, when the hands and feet stir and the mouth speaks recklessly, is this done deliberately or does it arise naturally?
Laozi said: This is the natural work of qi, not taught by evil forces.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, if the hands and feet stir and the mouth speaks recklessly without cease, what should one do?
Laozi said: For some, it lasts two periods; for others, one period. When the qi settles and the mind becomes single-minded, it will cease of itself.

Someone asked: If one sees strange things while practicing the Dao, should one tell others?
Laozi said: If you tell others, the spirits will no longer return. Strange things are the couriers of the true person—do not scold or curse them; doing good is best.

Someone asked: After the Dao is understood, may one discuss inauspicious and evil things?
Laozi said: Discussing inauspicious things invites misfortune and harm. Nightmares, confusion, and a host of evils will gather, making it difficult for the upright qi to arrive while the evil qi follows.

Someone asked: After the Dao is understood, when should one eat?
Laozi said: Once the Dao begins its steps, eat after completing the steps. If you do not step, the qi will merge and digest food on its own.

Someone asked: What should one eat when practicing the Dao?
Laozi said: Eat dry, light foods—grains, parched wheat, dried meat, dates, and chestnuts—to lengthen the breath and nurture life.

Someone asked: After practicing the Dao, how many days must pass before one may eat heavy foods or pungent vegetables?
Laozi said: One hundred days after the Dao is accomplished, if you wish to eat, moderation and restraint should be the foundation.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, if one eats little and feels hungry, what should one do?
Laozi said: Though hungry, keep the breath calm and composed. Eating to fullness causes the five viscera to clash, making it difficult for the qi to flow.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, may one abstain from grains?
Laozi said: If you wish to transcend the world and leave the mundane, you must swiftly cut off grains and rely on the breath. Over time, you will neither hunger nor thirst—this is the great essential of the Dao.

Someone asked: When cultivating essence and thought in the Dao, may one avoid abstaining from grains?
Laozi said: A belly full of grains is filled with rot and filth; the spirit does not dwell in the body. But if you practice the Dao without cease, over time you will naturally cease to hunger.

Someone asked: From birth to adulthood, people grow by eating grains—why abstain from them?
Laozi said: Grains only help people grow to adulthood; they are not meant to be eaten until old age. Aging and death are all due to grains.

Someone asked: If one abstains from grains, can one transcend the world?
Laozi said: Those who align with the formless will know this naturally. Simply preserve the qi and refine the body—why worry about not enduring long?

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao and abstaining from grains, if the five viscera develop minor illnesses, what should one do?
Laozi said: Do not yet abstain from grains; practice moderation in eating. After another hundred days, cut off grains and rice porridge, and consume only pure foods.

Someone asked: After the Dao is accomplished, may one drink wine?
Laozi said: Wine causes confusion, knots the qi and vessels, blocks the hundred channels, and generates internal heat. It is better not to drink—purity is best.

Someone asked: Can one practice the Dao while abstaining from wine?
Laozi said: Do not harm the blood and vessels. If you wish to practice the Dao, first inhale deeply, fill the belly, and exhale dozens of times—then you may proceed.

Someone asked: Can hunger or fullness harm the Dao?
Laozi said: Extreme hunger scatters the qi, extreme drunkenness disperses it, great anger exhausts it, great joy makes it soar, and great fright harms the spirit.

Someone asked: Are there prohibitions in the Dao regarding movement and stillness?
Laozi said: Prolonged gazing harms vision, prolonged listening harms hearing, prolonged lying harms the qi, prolonged labor harms essence, prolonged standing harms the bones, and prolonged walking harms the sinews.

Someone asked: Can the five flavors harm the Dao?
Laozi said: Salt harms the blood, sourness harms the marrow, sweetness harms the lungs, acridity harms the heart, and bitterness harms essence. Each of the five flavors has its harm—when taken into the mouth, harmonious flavor is best.

Someone asked: Can one practice the Dao in wind, cold, rain, or dampness?
Laozi said: Avoid them. Do not close the eyes; anticipate and evade them. When the Dao’s qi is abundant, evil qi will have no way to harm you.

Someone asked: If one has moxibustion, acupuncture, wounds, or takes medicine, can one still practice the Dao?
Laozi said: Avoid them. Moxibustion, acupuncture, and wounds cause the qi to leak. Medicine harms the five viscera.

Someone asked: Are there rules for sitting and rising in the Dao?
Laozi said: When sitting, keep the knees level, relax the groin, straighten the spine, lift the head, inwardly gaze, contain the breath, and rest calmly. When the form is full and the qi abundant, the spirit will not scatter.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, if the mind is often unhappy, melancholy, or restless, what should one focus on?
Laozi said: Constantly think of good, and good qi will come. If you often dwell on evil, evil will come and harm you. Simply focus the mind on guarding the Dao, and evil will have no way to intrude.

Someone asked: When practicing the Dao, should one invoke anything?
Laozi said: First call the names of the five spirits: the heart spirit is named Taowen, the liver spirit is named Jianjian, the lung spirit is named Yanyan, the spleen spirit is named Beibei, and the kidney spirit is named Fufu. Call them in order, and the qi will arrive at the cinnabar field.

Someone asked: When entering the chamber in the Dao, where does the yang qi arise, and to what is the life’s destiny attached?
Laozi said: The qi arises from the gallbladder, and destiny is attached to the eyes. Knowing these two, one may enter the chamber; without knowing them, the Dao will surely lead to confusion.

Someone asked: After years of accumulating the Dao’s qi, what is the proof?
Laozi said: After years of accumulating the Dao, one’s vision penetrates ten thousand miles. The sun, moon, stars, bright mirrors, torches, and radiant sunlight will come to illuminate the signs. The various spirits will guard and protect, coming without being summoned—this is the proof of the Dao. Beware of reckless speech.

Someone asked: Is there a time limit for the Dao’s accomplishment?
Laozi said: Sixty days is the middle measure, one hundred days the great measure. Once the Dao is accomplished, the body will no longer age. Over time, the qi will move like wind and rain.

Someone asked: Where does the Dao-body reside in its rules and measures?
Laozi said: Within the chamber of rules and measures lies its discipline. Roundness becomes the compass, squareness the carpenter’s square—who knows where the compass rests and the square strikes? Only father and son, passing it between them, know.

Laozi said: Do not sell my Dao to seek money; do not peddle my Dao to force it upon the powerful and honored; do not diminish my Dao to curry favor with the cunning and flattering. My Dao is secret and weighty, not to be transmitted for ten thousand gold. When sages appear, it emerges; when none exist, it remains hidden. Transmit it to the right person, and the Dao will become clear and bright; transmit it to the wrong person, and calamity will return upon you. Conceal it in a golden chamber, seal it with jade gates, hold fast with sealed lips and bound tongue—never reveal my writings. Swear an oath in blood, and ascend to pay homage to the Primordial Ancestors.

Laozi said: When ordinary worldly people seek the Dao and virtue, they must first preserve their spirit. Its true essence is white as a luminous pearl: at dawn, it resides in the philtrum below the nose; at mealtime, it rests within the hairline; at midday, it dwells in the head.

At the morning meal, it resides between the two points on the nape of the neck; at the evening meal, it rests in the waist. At sunset, it dwells in the *guimin*; at midnight, in the *yuying*; when the head passes, in the stomach’s gate; toward dawn, it supports the spleen; at cockcrow, it enters the lungs, passing through the throat into the center; at dawn, it returns to the philtrum below the nose. In drinking, eating, walking, and all activities, one must constantly bear this in mind. This is called "preserving the spirit to attain longevity" and "planting the root of Dao and virtue."

**Method for Fasting and Absorbing Qi**
For those who wish to fast and ascend to emptiness in pursuit of immortality, first settle in a quiet chamber. Invoke the names of the Three Spirits, then absorb qi:

1. **Primordial Ancestor Imperial Minister**, guardian of the Upper Cinnabar Field, enable me to attain what I seek, send forth the traveling kitchen, and fill me with abundant qi.
2. **Radiant Child Cinnabar**, guardian of the Middle Cinnabar Field, enable me to attain what I seek, send forth the traveling kitchen, and fill me with abundant qi.
3. **Primordial Yang Valley Mystery**, guardian of the Lower Cinnabar Field, enable me to attain what I seek, send forth the traveling kitchen, and fill me with abundant qi.

After invoking the Three Spirits, at dawn on an empty stomach, face east, hands and feet held five inches from the body, fists curled like an infant’s grasp. Lower the head to rest on a pillow, close the mouth and eyes, hold a peppercorn in the mouth, and draw its essence. Inhale qi through the nose, swallow the numinous spring once, then gently exhale the breath from the mouth. Repeat this absorption of qi 360 times, called "one session." Ninety inhalations require one breath; regulate strength and resume, completing another ninety. Four such breaths complete one session. At noon and sunset, perform the absorption likewise.

After ten days, the medicinal power is prepared. Between sessions, practice the Six Methods to dispel the Six Ailments:
1. **Xu** expels bodily exhaustion.
2. **He** expels heat.
3. **Chui** expels wind.
4. **Xiao** expels cold.
5. **Ke** expels stagnant qi.
6. **Xi** expels vexation.

Avoid prolonged gazing, excessive walking, excessive speech, prolonged standing, or excessive sleep. Do not ride or mount beasts. When absorbing qi, if thirsty, drink water or honeyed nectar. Before beginning, resolve to fast, and the medicine will readily take effect. If unable to continue, after the session, avoid cold or hot foods, excessive flavors, or sudden fullness, which harm the body. Initially, eat only a little porridge, gradually increasing qi absorption over days before eating rice, still avoiding fullness. As qi absorption decreases, food intake may increase, and after a full day, one may eat to satiety, then cease qi absorption. This is the path of safety.

After three days of fasting, slight fatigue arises; after fourteen days, it recurs. Dizziness may occur—do not be alarmed. After ten days, essence, qi, and strength wane slightly, and the complexion becomes sallow. After twenty days, movement causes dizziness, limbs feel heavy, bowel movements become slightly difficult, urine turns reddish-yellow, or one may experience diarrhea, with the front weak and the back stiff. After thirty days, the body grows emaciated, and walking becomes laborious. After forty days, the complexion brightens, and the mind and body find peace. After fifty days, the Five Viscera harmonize, and essence and qi nurture the interior. After sixty days, flesh and form return to normal, and joints move smoothly. After seventy days, the heart dislikes noise, and aspirations soar. After eighty days, one becomes indifferent and serene, faith and clarity guarding the Way. After ninety days, the countenance becomes lustrous and smooth, and the voice resonant and clear. After a hundred days, essence and qi fully arrive, and efficacy grows daily. If cultivation persists without cease, lifespan naturally lengthens.

After three years, the *jiupan* vanishes, and the complexion radiates. After six years, marrow fills the bones, and one foresees life and death. After nine years, one commands ghosts and spirits, jade maidens attend at one’s side, the brain solidifies, and the ribs join—no harm can befall one. This is called a "Perfected Person," who assists the Supreme Emperor, shares the lifespan of Heaven, and merges light with the sun and moon. Transmitting this to the wrong person brings disaster upon oneself.

**The Chart of Divine Immortality** states:
If you constantly bear the Dao in mind, the Dao will bear you in mind. In sorrow and adversity, think of the Dao; in illness, think of the Dao; in poverty and lowliness, think of the Dao; in hardship, think of the Dao; in wealth and honor, think of the Dao; in eating and drinking, think of the Dao; entering mountains and marshes, think of the Dao; crossing rivers and seas, think of the Dao; when rising, think of the Dao; in all actions, think of the Dao—the Dao accompanies you.

Where the Dao emerges, the myriad things are born, and the myriad spirits are perfected. There is nothing it does not protect, nothing it does not ennoble. If you forget the Dao even for a moment, the Dao enters the Eight Darknesses. Bearing the Dao in mind and absorbing qi, you will attain longevity.

The Dao is I, and I am with you. If you wish to guard the path of longevity, preserve it. In movement and stillness, eating and drinking, sitting and rising, and even in breathing, always bear it in mind, never forgetting it day or night. Thus, you will be preserved, essence, qi, and spirit never leaving the body—then you will attain longevity.

**The Scripture of Manifest Dao concludes.**
