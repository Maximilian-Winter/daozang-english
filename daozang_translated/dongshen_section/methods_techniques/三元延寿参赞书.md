**Preface to *The Three Primordials’ Extension of Longevity: A Book of Assistance***
"Those who have attained office serve as good ministers; those who have not, as good physicians"—such were the words of the ancients.
To assist the Son of Heaven, ensuring that his beneficent dew bathes the common people, is the duty of the prime minister.
To govern the state and bring relief to the people, transforming their suffering into joy, is the work of the physician.
Yet if the virtue bestowed and the healing wrought by the blade and the pill bring only temporary relief, failing to endure, they cannot be called truly good.
Only those who take the world’s welfare as their own burden, who establish rites and create music, whose deeds are recorded in the annals—those whose blessings are received by countless generations, as if they still beheld Gao, Kui, Ji, Xie, Yi, or the Duke of Zhou—
Or those who clarify the patterns of pulse, disease, symptoms, and treatment, who master the well, brook, stream, river, and sea points in acupuncture, whose methods are preserved in medical texts—those whose beneficence is received by countless generations, as if they still beheld Lei Gong, Qi Bo, Fu Yu, Cang, or Bian—
These are the reasons a physician or minister may be called good.

When I journeyed from Fujian to the capital for an audience, I fell gravely ill along the way. Though I took many remedies, none proved effective. Upon reaching Shimen in Raozhou, I heard of Li Chengxin, a scholar-physician in Jiande of Chizhou, and hastened to summon him. After examining me, he declared, "This can indeed be cured with a single dose." Later, when we discussed the preservation of life and health, he said, "I have compiled *The Three Primordials’ Extension of Longevity: A Book of Assistance* in five juan, along with a collection of *Emergency Remedies*, intending to publish them to aid the imperial court in guiding the people toward the realm of longevity."

Upon reviewing his work, I found it extraordinary, and his dedication to saving lives truly marks him as a good physician. I commended his efforts and helped fulfill his ambition, ensuring his teachings would endure. Those concerned with health should vie to be the first to read this.

To live without doubt between early death and long life, to cultivate the self and await destiny—this is the scholar’s task. The contents of this compilation, which focus on restraining anger and curbing desires, are indeed essential to self-cultivation. I have had it printed to spread its teachings widely. Readers must not dismiss it as too simple or shallow.

*Written on the full moon of the auspicious month in the wuyin year of the Zhiyuan era (1268) by He Yuangao, Grand Master for Assisting the State, Administrator of Jiaxing Prefecture, and concurrently Commissioner of Agriculture.*

My friend Li Chengxin once journeyed hundreds of *li* to visit his mother, only to find her household beset by misfortune. Through medicine, he saved twenty-eight lives. At the time, his medical knowledge was not yet profound, and he feared his success was mere luck; thus, he sought my guidance. I held him in deep respect and admiration, and so I concealed nothing from him. Yet his innate intelligence was keen, and whatever he heard, he grasped at once. Moreover, his heart was never careless, and his pursuit of learning was tireless—through medicine, he thus saved many lives.

Many who met him in their old age would say: "The merit of medicine is great indeed!" But how could one’s ears and eyes reach everyone to aid them? He wished for all to know how to preserve their own health, so that illness might become rare and reliance on pulses and medicines unnecessary. He produced this book to show them—truly a treasure for preserving life. I have helped him proofread and correct it, and urged him to hasten its printing, saying: "From this point on, you will meet with good fortune."

Recorded on a day in the auspicious month of the xinmao year of the Zhiyuan era (1291) by Ye Yinghe of Lushan, styled Jinne.

*Volume One of the* Three Yuan Extending Life Assisting Birth [*Sanyuan Yanshou Canzan Shu*]
*Compiled by the Old Man of Jiuhua, Chengxin Li Pengfei*

Of all things between Heaven and Earth, humans are the most noble—yet confined by form, they know not why they are noble. The head is round, mirroring Heaven; the feet are square, mirroring Earth. The eyes resemble the sun and moon; hair, flesh, bones, and skin resemble mountains, forests, soil, and stone. Breath becomes wind; sighs become dew. Joy brings auspicious stars and felicitous clouds; anger summons thunder and swift lightning. Blood and fluids flow and moisten like the Yangtze, the Huai, and the four seas.

Moreover, the four limbs correspond to the four seasons; the five viscera to the five phases; the six bowels to the six pitch-pipes. In such ways, our bodies and the cosmos flow as one—how could they not be noble?

According to the teachings of the *Zang* and the *Jiao*, when father and mother unite, karmic spirits enter the womb. Earth, water, fire, and wind—all conditions harmonize, and life gradually takes form. In the first seven-day period, it resembles the root of a lotus. In the second, it thickens like curdled milk. In the third, it takes the shape of shoes and socks. In the fourth, it hardens like a warmed stone. In the fifth, a wind called *Sheti* stirs the embryo, and the head, two arms, and navel—five features—appear. In the sixth, a wind named *Xuanzhuan* arises, and the two hands and feet—four features—emerge. By the seventh and eighth seven-day periods, the ten fingers and twenty-four features manifest. In the ninth, the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and the two lower orifices—nine features—appear. In the tenth, a wind called *Pumen* blows, solidifying the form and generating the five viscera. In the eleventh, the upper and lower qi circulate. In the twelfth, the large and small intestines develop. In the thirteenth, hunger and thirst arise, and flavors from food and drink enter through the navel. In the fourteenth, fifty vessels form on the front, back, left, and right of the body. In the fifteenth, twenty more vessels emerge, completing the eight hundred vessels for inhalation throughout the body.

In the sixteenth seven-day period, a wind named *Ganlu* settles the two eyes and regulates all incoming and outgoing breath. In the seventeenth, a wind called *Maofu* ensures smooth passage through the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, throat, and chest—all points of entry. In the eighteenth, a wind named *Wugou* purifies the six senses. In the nineteenth, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—four senses—are perfected, yielding three kinds of retribution: body, life, and mind. In the twentieth, a wind named *Jiangu* forms the two feet, two hands, twenty finger joints, the two hundred major bones of the body, and all minor bones. In the twenty-first, a wind called *Shengqi* generates flesh. In the twenty-second, a wind named *Fuliu* produces blood. In the twenty-third, skin forms. In the twenty-fourth, the skin becomes smooth and radiant. In the twenty-fifth, blood and flesh grow moist and supple. In the twenty-sixth, hair, nails, and body hair connect with the vessels. In the twenty-seventh, hair, nails, and body hair fully develop. In the twenty-eighth, eight perceptions—such as dwellings, gardens, and rivers—arise. In the twenty-ninth, each takes on its karmic hue, whether dark or fair. In the thirtieth, dark and fair hues manifest. From the thirty-first to the thirty-fourth seven-day periods, the body gradually grows. In the thirty-fifth, the limbs are complete. In the thirty-sixth, the fetus becomes restless. In the thirty-seventh, three perceptions arise: aversion to conflict, disgust at filth, and fear of darkness. In the thirty-eighth, a wind named *Lanhua* stretches the arms and turns the body downward. Then, the *Quxia* wind directs the feet upward and the head downward, toward the birth passage. At this moment, if the myriad spirits chant in reverence, a boy is born; if they chant in deference, a girl is born.

As for the five viscera, six bowels, sinews, bones, marrow, brain, skin, blood vessels, essence storehouse, water storehouse, twenty-eight thousand forms and shadows, twelve thousand radiant essences, thirty-six thousand points of ingress and egress, and eighty-four thousand pores—each is governed by its own spirit. How easily, then, is this human body obtained? And how shallow is the debt of nurture and care?

Given the grace of Heaven and Earth, our parents, in bringing forth this body—so difficult to obtain, so noble, so precious—of the five blessings, the first is longevity alone. Once longevity is secured, wealth, honor, success, and influence follow; one may serve the ruler and benefit the people, glorify ancestors and inspire descendants, achieving all that elevates the household. For this body is the body of one’s parents. To treat it lightly is to treat them lightly. How can one fail to guard it well, preserving the lifespan bestowed by Heaven, and thus fulfill the great duty of serving one’s parents?

Some may ask: Infants and young children, their celestial purity yet unspoiled, neither violate dietary restrictions nor transgress taboos—yet some die prematurely. Why? This is the fault of the parents. The father may suffer from yang excess and yin deficiency, or yin excess and yang deficiency; the seven emotions may be pent up within, or the eight evils may assail from without. The mother, chilled during pregnancy, may take warming medicines; the father, impotent, may consume alchemical elixirs. Or, though the fetal essence is full, lust remains unchecked—like a flower harmed by improper nurture, its fruit fails to ripen. After birth, the child’s endowment is weak, and care is improper: indulgence is excessive. Though sleep is deep, they are made to chew; though the bed is warm, they are given drink. Heavy quilts and thick wraps are piled on, yet they are dressed further. Patting their backs or adjusting their clothes, wind arises from within. Pointing at objects and calling them insects, they are startled by play. Held upright and released, they are laughed at for their distress. To provoke laughter, their ribs are poked. When thunder roars or drums beat, their ears are covered. Left to sleep too long, they are not roused early. Overfed, they are not restrained.

Letting infants sleep exposed to drafts, or frightening them with tales of spirits and ghosts—such missteps are not few. These words are the profound teachings of Yanshan Xingweng. Parents who take them as a mirror shall see their descendants flourish, sharing in this same longevity—how grand an outcome!

Those who preserve the primordial qi of Heaven’s allotted lifespan attain it. The union of man and woman is one of humanity’s great bonds; solitary yang cannot generate life, nor can solitary yin bring it to fruition—there are aspects of the human Dao that cannot be abandoned. Zhuang Zhou once said: "What is most to be feared in man lies in the intimacy of the bedchamber; those who fail to exercise restraint commit error." For this body flows in harmony with the workings of creation: the left is the kidney, belonging to water, while the right is the Gate of Life, belonging to fire. Yang arises at midnight, and fire is truly stored there, like the tortoise and serpent of the north. The bladder is the fu-organ of the left kidney, and the Triple Burner is the fu-organ of the right kidney. The Triple Burner possesses a fatty membrane the size of a palm, directly opposite the bladder, from which two white vessels emerge, ascending along the spine to penetrate the brain. The Upper Burner resides in the chest, corresponding internally to the heart; the Middle Burner lies in the solar plexus, corresponding to the spleen; the Lower Burner is below the navel, where the dynamic qi of the kidneys stirs. Distributed throughout the body, when it remains in tranquil stillness and desire does not arise, the essence-qi disperses through the Triple Burner, nourishing the hundred vessels. Yet when desire stirs and the fire of lust blazes, it converges upon the Burner, and the essence-qi overflows, pouring forth from the Gate of Life—how fearful! Alas, the primordial essence is finite, while human desire knows no bounds. Fire is born of wood, and when calamity erupts, it must consume its source. If the tail’s gate is not restrained, even the vast ocean will run dry.

In youth, when blood and qi are not yet settled, one cannot uphold Confucius’ warning against indulgence in sensual pleasure; in old age, when one should reduce desire and quiet the mind, one fails to grasp the methods of nourishing life as taught by Liezi. I know not how such a course can be deemed acceptable. The Daoist Master in Hemp Robes said: "Heaven, Earth, and Man are ranked as the Three Powers. Man, possessing the central Dao, may study to become a sage or an immortal. Moreover, man’s destiny surpasses that of all things between Heaven and Earth. Yet people today do not cultivate the human Dao, instead indulging in greed and desire, diminishing their allotted span until they differ not from mere things—hence the suffering of aging, illness, and premature death. Those who take this as a mirror must understand how to value themselves, and thus may attain the longevity of Heaven’s primordial endowment."

Desire cannot be entirely cut off. The Yellow Emperor said: "The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao; an excess of either yin or yang is called illness." He also said: "When the two are not in harmony, it is like spring without autumn, or winter without summer. To harmonize them is the sage’s measure." The sage does not sever the Dao of union but values its secrecy and restraint to preserve Heaven’s true essence. The *Su Nü* states: "At twenty, one may discharge once every four days; at thirty, once every eight days; at forty, once every sixteen days; at fifty, once every twenty days." These are guiding principles. Those who are robust, consume ample food and drink, and possess vigorous essence-qi may slightly exceed this measure.

As with a well—deep in source and long in flow—though it fills as soon as it is drawn, one still fears its exhaustion. If one’s constitution is frail, the primordial qi inherently weak, and further, if food is scant and essence depleted, yet one forces the act, it is like a coward attempting the defense of Feng Fu—only to sharpen the tiger’s fangs.

The *Su Nü* states: "At sixty, one should not discharge yang essence. If one’s qi and strength remain robust, one must not forcibly endure abstinence, for prolonged retention without release may lead to paralysis and illness."

Peng Zu said: "A man cannot be without a woman, nor a woman without a man. If the mind is truly pure and free from desire, that is most excellent and conduces to long life." He also said: "If a man discharges essence twice a month—twenty-four times a year—he may attain a lifespan of two hundred years."

The *Treatise of Eminent Physicians* states: "When desires are endless and wishes unfulfilled, the mind indulges in external fantasies, leading to seminal emission. Excessive indulgence in the bedchamber causes the ancestral sinews to slacken." As the texts say: "For men, essence is primary; for women, blood is primary. Thus, when essence is abundant, one seeks a chamber; when blood is abundant, one conceives. If yang is isolated without yin, or yin alone without yang, desire burns unfulfilled, and yin and yang contend, giving rise to alternating chills and fever, which over time becomes consumptive illness."

The scion of a wealthy family, Tang Jing, developed sores on his private parts that festered. The Daoist Zhou Shouzhen said: "The illness arose from desire to discharge that could not be discharged." In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the attendant of the Prince of Jibei, a woman named Han, suffered from back pain and alternating chills and fever. Master Cang said: "The illness arose from desiring a man who could not be obtained."

Desire must not be indulged too early.

Chu Cheng, a grandee of Qi, said: "For a frail girl, nourish the blood—she should marry at the proper time. For a delicate boy, moderate his passions—he should wed only when fully grown." The texts state: "If a boy breaks his yang too early, his essence darkens and is harmed. If a girl breaks her yin too early, her blood vessels are injured." The texts further state: "If one engages with a woman before the essence flows freely, forcing it to flow, the five limbs may remain unfilled, and in later days, suffer from indescribable ailments." The texts say: "The daughter of Wei Yi, upon the first arrival of *tiangui*, was already intimate with men. Her yin qi was prematurely drained, leaving her incomplete and injured." The texts state: "When young boys and maidens harbor longing in their hearts, their thoughts excessive and misplaced, they often incur grievous harm. In boys, the spirit and complexion scatter first; in girls, the monthly flow ceases prematurely."

Desire must not be indulged.

The *Huangting Jing* says: "For long life, be most cautious in the chamber’s urgency—why court death and make the spirits weep?" Peng Zu said: "The superior man sleeps with separate bedding; the middling man, with separate covers." To consume a thousand doses of medicine is not as good as sleeping alone. Laozi said: "When passions arise from the five viscera, the hun-soul steadies and the po-soul stills—this is life. When passions surge from the breast and diaphragm, essence scatters and spirit wanders—this is death." Peng Zu said: "Lovely faces and charming concubines fill the chamber, bringing the calamity of depletion. Know this, and you may attain long life." The *Yinfu Jing* says: "Lascivious sounds and fair forms are the axe and saw that hew the bones." If people of this world cannot grasp the luminous candle to illumine deluded passions, nor wield the sword of wisdom to sever love and desire, they will drift upon the sea of life and death, where harm arises from what they cherish.

Quan Yuanqi said: "Unrestrained pleasure in sensuality depletes the essence; careless expenditure without cease scatters it." The sage treasures essence and weighs its bestowal, so that marrow fills and bones harden. The texts state: "In advanced years, when blood and qi are already weak, if one senses the stirring of yang affairs, one must be cautious and restrain it—one must not indulge the heart and exhaust the will. Each time one does not discharge, a fire is extinguished; each fire extinguished, oil is added. If one does not control but instead indulges passion, it is like a lamp’s flame about to gutter, yet still removing its oil." *Zhuangzi* said: "Those who delve deeply into desires have shallow heavenly mechanisms." In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Qin physician He examined the illness of the Marquis of Jin and said: "This comes from approaching the women’s chambers—it is neither ghost nor food, but bewilderment that loses the will." The Marquis asked: "Should women not be approached?" He replied: "Practice moderation."

The *Xuan Shu* states: "Primordial qi is the moving qi between the kidneys. The right kidney is the Gate of Life, the dwelling of essence and spirit. Cherish and protect it, and when constructive and defensive qi circulate freely, spirit and qi will not be exhausted—one may then share the lifespan of heaven and earth." The *Treatise on Primordial Qi* says: "The nature of desires is inherently boundless. To pursue limitless desires with a life of finite capacity is to hasten one’s own destruction." The *Scripture of the Immortals* advises: "Do not labor the body, do not agitate the essence. Return the heart to stillness and silence—thus may one attain longevity." A classic verse declares:

The Dao treasures essence as its jewel,
Guard it well, keep it secret.
Bestowed upon others, it gives them life;
Retained within, it sustains oneself.
Even binding the infant is not yet permissible—
How much less to cast it away like shards?
Waste and loss accumulate unnoticed,
Till aging and decline bring life to its end.

The *Book of the Immortals* states: "In the Dao of yin and yang, essence is the treasure. Guard it carefully, and one may age only after heaven’s time." Another text warns: "When sounds and sights stir within, when passions and affections entangle, when the heart stirs with thoughts and attachments, when daydreams and night visions chase boundless desires—then the hundred spirits grow weary and dissipate, the dwelling loses its treasure and collapses." It further says: "To indulge desire without restraint, to lack self-preservation—this is to invite depletion and harm. It is like rotten wood that snaps in the wind, or a crumbling bank that collapses at the first touch of water. Yet if one cherishes and moderates desire, longevity may still be attained."

Another text notes: "The kidney’s yin connects internally to the ears, while the bladder channel emerges at the outer canthus of the eyes. When the eyes go blind and the ears lose their hearing, this is the harm wrought by the bedchamber." It also states: "Human lifespan, whether long or short, depends on moderation. If one nurtures life properly, one may live without dying; if one indulges passion, life becomes like the morning dew." Another passage declares: "Excessive desire depletes essence. What one may preserve is life; what one should cherish is the body; what one must value above all is essence. When liver essence is unstable, the eyes grow dim and lose their luster; when lung essence is unharmonized, the flesh wastes away; when kidney essence is unstable, spirit and qi diminish; when spleen essence is weak, teeth and hair loosen and fall. If true essence is ceaselessly dissipated, illness arises, and death follows. The lament of the immortals sings:

Alas! Alas!
The Primordial Yang Palace stands unguarded.
A single drop lost to jealous beauty—
A hundred spirits weep as the radiance of essence departs.
The Three Corpses rejoice, the Seven Po souls rage,
Blood fails, qi wanes—what remedy remains?
The foot-long dwelling, the inch-wide field now belong to another,
Who shall tend the jade furnace, who shall guard the cinnabar cauldron?
I urge the world: forsake lust,
For what good comes of clinging to desire?
When one spirit departs, a hundred follow;
When a hundred depart, the person knows nothing.
How many times have I longed to speak but could not—
Now, at last, the celestial secret is revealed.

Desire must not be forced.
The *Plain Questions* states: "To force oneself through exertion injures kidney qi and crumbles the high bones." The commentary explains: "Forced exertion refers to sexual activity. Forcing oneself in the bedchamber depletes essence; essence depleted, the kidneys are harmed; the kidneys harmed, marrow qi withers within, and one suffers lumbar pain with inability to bend or straighten." The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "Guard the chamber of essence in haste, do not recklessly discharge. Seal and treasure it—thus may one live long." Another text warns: "When yang wilts and desire cannot be satisfied, to forcibly take minerals and stones to bolster yang is to dry up kidney water, leaving heart fire to burn unchecked. The five viscera grow parched, and wasting-thirst arises at once." Jin Ne says: "A weak fire cannot diminish a blazing fire—it may instead give rise to sores and ulcers." Another text states: "Those who strain in the bedchamber suffer essence exhaustion, emaciation, weakness, fright palpitations, dream emissions, seminal dribbling, turbid urine, yang wilting, tension in the lower abdomen, darkening of the face, and deafness."

The Perfected One says: "The Dao of nurturing life lies in not forcing what one cannot endure." The *Master Embracing Simplicity* states: "To strain in thought beyond one’s capacity, to lift beyond one’s strength—such harm is grave indeed. The word 'force' is truly the root of self-destruction and life-shortening. Food and drink are meant to nourish life, yet to drink to drunkenness and force more wine, to eat to satiety and force more food—none of this fails to sicken and harm the body. How much more so with desire! To force desire is to scatter primordial essence, to separate primordial spirit, to disperse primordial qi—beware of it."

Desire has its prohibitions.
One text says: "Overeating and overindulgence in the bedchamber damage blood and qi, causing stagnation that seeps into the large intestine, resulting in passing clear blood and abdominal pain—a condition called intestinal aggregation." Another warns: "Entering the bedchamber while heavily drunk exhausts qi and injures the liver. In men, essence and semen diminish, and yang wilts; in women, menstruation weakens, stagnant blood lingers, and malignant sores arise." Another states: "Engaging in the bedchamber by candlelight is a lifelong taboo." Yet another says: "To exert oneself in the bedchamber while enraged depletes essence and disrupts qi, giving rise to phlegm-abscesses. To enter the bedchamber in fear and dread unbalances yin and yang, causing reversal, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, and eventually consumptive exhaustion." Another text notes: "Entering the bedchamber while fatigued from long travel leads to the five taxations and consumptive depletion." Another warns: "To engage in intercourse before menstruation has ceased produces white patches. Cold qi may also enter, causing the body and face to wither and yellow, and preventing childbirth." Another states: "To engage in intercourse before a metal-inflicted wound has healed stirs blood and qi, causing the wound to fester and worsen." Another says: "To enter the bedchamber while holding back urine leads to strangury, pain in the penis, loss of complexion, or even bladder reversal with acute pain below the navel that may prove fatal." Another text observes: "Some recover from illness and immediately resume the bedchamber; some are young yet act as if old. They cannot moderate worldly affairs, nor can they frequently take rare medicines. Through this, illness takes hold, and as months and years pass, flesh wastes and bones dissolve—then they blame spirits and ghosts. Yet it is like a lamp guttering when its oil is spent, or a person perishing when marrow is exhausted. Adding oil strengthens the lamp; replenishing marrow strengthens the person. What blame lies with old age or ghosts? The harm is entirely self-inflicted."

Another text states: "In intercourse and ejaculation, the three burners—heart, spleen, and kidneys—are inevitably stirred."

When aroused, heat flares and the fire of desire burns fiercely; if one then enters water, the heat becomes pent in the middle burner, giving rise to jaundice. When qi prevails in the lower burner, the forehead darkens. When blood in the upper burner flows errantly, it follows stagnant heat into the stool, turning it black and tarry. Men and women who bathe together in the same chamber often suffer these afflictions.

Another text warns: Those who consume *nao* and *she* before intercourse will find their gates and orifices opened, their true qi scattered. In severe cases, this leads to depletion and dizziness; in mild cases, to brain leakage.

The *Bencao* states: Indulging in intercourse after eating much garlic injures the liver and dulls the complexion.

Another text observes: If one engages in the bedchamber while sweating, wind may enter and give rise to consumptive wind.

Another cautions: Those with red eyes must abstain from intercourse to avoid internal congestion.

Another records: If one resumes bedroom affairs before recovering from seasonal illness, the tongue may protrude several inches in death.

In *The Records of the Three Kingdoms*, when Zixian’s illness had just abated, Hua Tuo examined his pulse and found it still weak, not yet restored. He warned: “Do not engage in strenuous activity; if your complexion returns, you will die—and your tongue will protrude several inches.” His wife, having traveled a hundred *li* to visit him, stayed the night and lay with him. Three days later, the illness flared, and all unfolded as Hua Tuo had foretold. How dreadful!

Let those who would avoid such fates take heed.

Sun Zhenren said: In times of extreme cold or heat, one must not indulge in lust.

Another records: On days of great wind, heavy rain, thick fog, thunder and lightning, solar or lunar eclipses, rainbows, earthquakes, or when the heavens and earth are dark and murky—beneath the sun, moon, or stars, within temples, monasteries, or sacred precincts, beside wells, privies, or enclosures, or near graves, coffins, or corpses—one must not transgress. If a woman is violated at such times, it harms the spirit of the man. Should conception occur then, not only will the parents suffer a hundredfold harm, but the child born will be unfilial, afflicted with illness, and short-lived.

During the Tang dynasty, Wei Zheng warned: One must not violate the days of long life or the days when the gods descend; those who engage in lust on such days shorten their lifespan. The *Secret of Preserving Life* states:
- On the first day of the lunar month, one year of life is deducted;
- On the full moon, ten years;
- On the last day of the month, one year.
- On the eighth (first quarter) and twenty-third (last quarter), five years;
- On the equinoxes, solstices, and community sacrifices, four years each;
- On *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, and one’s own birth day, two years.
- On the third day of the first lunar month, when all spirits assemble, and on the fourteenth and sixteenth, when the Three Officials descend;
- On the second day of the second month, when all spirits gather;
- On the ninth day of the third month, when the Ox-Demon spirits descend—those who transgress will suffer sudden illness within a hundred days.
- On the fourth day of the fourth month, when ten thousand Buddhas transform for good—transgression brings sores.
- On the night of the eighth, when the spirits of good and evil children descend—transgression leads to death by bleeding.
- The three fifth days, sixth, and seventh of the fifth month are the Nine Toxic Days—those who transgress will not live past three years.
- On the night of the tenth day of the tenth month, when the Heavenly King of the West descends—transgression brings death within a year.
- On the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, when the Plundering Marshal descends—transgression shortens lifespan.
- On the night of the seventh day of the twelfth month—transgression leads to death by malignant illness.
- On the twentieth, when the Heavenly Master performs rituals—transgression shortens lifespan.
- On the twenty-eighth of every month, when the human spirit resides in the yin—especially in the fourth and tenth months, when yin and yang are in pure operation—on all the above days, one must not engage in lust, let alone arrange marriages.

As the *Gengshen Treatise* states: The ancients often fulfilled their allotted years, while modern people do not reach their natural lifespan. Why? Because they recklessly disregard caution, indulge their passions, and secretly violate taboos, so that the netherworld deducts their allotted years. How many can truly live to a hundred?

King Mengchao of Shu took Zhang Lihua into a temple, and one night, a violent thunderstorm with lightning and fire struck her dead. The Daoist Li Ruochong, on the night of the Lantern Festival, saw in the hall a man in red shoes and official robes facing north, with sinners arrayed below. Among them, a woman suffered greatly. He reported this to his master, Tang Dongqing, who said: “That is Zhang Lihua. Once favored here, her profanation of the lofty immortals brought this upon her.” From this, we see that the taboos of heaven and earth must not be violated.

**Methods for Continuing the Lineage**
The consorts of Prince Xiao of Jianping were all beautiful but childless. They selected girls from good families who had not yet menstruated to enter the palace, yet still no children were born. The prince asked Chu Cheng: “Is there a method for begetting sons?” Cheng replied: “When uniting man and woman, one must wait until their years are ripe. Though a man’s essence may flow at sixteen, he must marry at thirty; though a woman’s menses may arrive at fourteen, she must wed at twenty. Only when yin and yang are fully mature should they unite. Conceiving then, bearing a child, and raising it will produce a strong, long-lived son. Now, it is not so—this is why the prince has no children.” The prince said: “Well said.” Before another year had passed, he fathered six sons.

Another records: If a man overstrains and harms himself, his kidney meridian will not warm, his essence will be as clear as water or as cold as ice, or it may pool without being ejaculated—all these prevent conception. As the *Recent Records* state: This is the exhaustion of essence and qi.

Another records: If a woman overstrains and harms her qi and blood, her menstrual cycle may be irregular, or she may suffer from red or white vaginal discharge, disrupting the harmony of yin and yang. Poor self-regulation, imbalanced diet, exposure to wind and cold, or cold qi invading her meridians and congealing in the uterus—all these prevent conception.

Another records: From the first to the third day of menstruation, the womb’s gate opens; union then may produce a child. After the fourth day, it closes, and no child will be conceived. Moreover, conception on the first, third, or fifth day after menstruation yields sons; on the second, fourth, or sixth day, daughters. After the sixth day, no pregnancy will take hold.

The *Lingxiao* flower: Planting it near a dwelling is taboo, for if a woman inhales its scent, she will not conceive.

**Taboos During Pregnancy**
The *Book of Childbirth* states:
- In the first month, the foot *jueyin* liver nourishes the blood—do not indulge in anger, exhaust your sinews, or expose yourself to evil winds.
- In the second month, the foot *shaoyang* gallbladder joins the liver—do not be startled or disturbed.
- In the third month, the hand *xinzhu* and right kidney nourish essence—do not indulge in lust, sorrow, or exposure to cold.
- In the fourth month, the hand *shaoyang* triple burner joins the kidney—do not overwork or overrest.
- In the fifth month, the foot *taiyin* spleen nourishes the flesh—do not indulge in reckless thoughts, hunger, or satiety, or expose yourself to dampness.
- In the sixth month, the foot *yangming* stomach joins the spleen—do not eat indiscriminately.
- In the seventh month, the hand *taiyin* lung nourishes the skin and hair—do not be melancholy or shout.
- In the eighth month, the hand *yangming* large intestine joins the lung to nourish qi—do not eat drying foods.
- In the ninth month, the foot *shaoyin* kidney nourishes the bones—do not be fearful, engage in bedroom affairs, or expose yourself to cold.
- In the tenth month, the foot *taiyang* bladder joins the kidney. As *taiyang* governs all yang qi, the child’s meridians and vessels are fully formed, the six bowels harmonized, and it separates from the mother, its spirit and form complete, awaiting the time of birth.

The heart is not mentioned because it governs the five viscera, like an emperor who must not act. If one regulates oneself properly, the fetal organs will not be harmed. Also, one must not needle or moxa the meridians in each month. If the mother craves a certain food, give it to her, and she will recover. Taboo foods are listed in the section on diet.

The *Taigong’s Teachings on Fetal Education* states: The mother should always dwell in a quiet chamber, listen often to beautiful words, discuss poetry and classics, expound on rites and music, avoid hearing evil words or seeing evil deeds, and not entertain wicked thoughts. This will ensure that the child—whether son or daughter—is blessed with longevity, sincerity, and fulfillment in both loyalty and filial piety.

The *Yanshan Old Man* states: After conception, if parents cannot restrain their desires, this is already impermissible. Moreover, if they engage in intercourse during labor, the child may emerge wearing a white membrane upon its head—a cause of illness and early death.

**Taboos for Infants**
The *Book* says: If the mother becomes pregnant again before the child can walk, and the child drinks the milk of pregnancy, it will surely develop *chi*-disease, becoming sallow and emaciated, with fever, skeletal frailty, and hair loss.

The *Book* says: Infants often fall ill because they are weaned too early and given solid food prematurely, or because the mother chews food to feed them, leading to illness. The child grows weak and thin, with a distended abdomen, stiff hair, and listlessness.

The *Direct Formula for Raising Children* states: Eat warm, not hot; eat soft, not hard; eat little, not much. This is a truly wondrous method.

The *Book* says: Do not let tears fall into a child’s eyes, lest it cause corneal damage and the growth of a membrane.

The *Miscellaneous Records* states: Do not let a child point at the moon, or it will develop *moon-eclipse sores*. Do not let it drink from a gourd or bottle, or it will become slow of speech. Also, do not leave its clothing exposed outdoors at night.

*San Yuan Yan Shou Can Zan Shu*, Scroll One, concludes.
*San Yuan Yan Shou Can Zan Shu*, Scroll Two.

The Venerable Li Pengfei of Jiuhua, the Clarity-Minded Elder, Compiles:

Those who attain longevity through the Earthly *qi* maintain regularity in their daily lives. The human body, as termed in the immortals’ formulas, is likened to a house. The ears, eyes, mouth, and nose are its windows and doors. The limbs and joints are its beams and pillars. Hair, skin, and flesh are its walls and tiles. There are the *qi* pivot, the blood chamber, the abode of intent, the dark granary and mysterious mansion, the mud-pellet palace and descending palace, the purple chamber and jade tower, the twelve-tiered tower, the gate of nobility, the flying gate, the mysterious female gate, and others—all varied, yet governed by a master.

Consider a house: if battered by violent winds and torrential rains, gnawed by insects and termites, or ravaged by rats and thieves, and left unchecked, it will gradually collapse, tilting westward until it becomes uninhabitable. The body is this house, and the heart is its master. If the master consistently tends to it, then its windows, doors, beams, pillars, walls, and tiles remain intact and sturdy, and the longevity of Earthly *qi* may be attained.

**The Dao of Nurturing Life**
*Laozi* says: The great span of human life is set at a hundred years. Those who regulate and protect it may live a thousand years, like the difference between a small flame and a great fire. While others speak grandly, I speak softly; while others fret overmuch, I remember little; while others rage, I remain unangered. Unburdened by worldly affairs, I abide in effortless non-action, and my spirit and *qi* naturally flourish—this is the elixir of immortality.

*Zhuangzi* says: Those who honor life, though wealthy and noble, do not harm themselves with excess; though poor and lowly, they do not weary their bodies with profit-seeking. Yet people today, even those of high age and esteemed rank, all neglect this truth.

*The Inscription of Sun the Perfected* states:
Excessive anger harms the liver’s black *qi*,
Excessive thought greatly depletes the spirit.
When the spirit is weary, the heart is easily enslaved;
When *qi* is weak, illness clings.
Avoid extremes of sorrow and joy,
And keep meals balanced.
Guard against nighttime drunkenness,
And above all, curb morning anger.
At midnight, swallow the saliva like a drumbeat;
At dawn, rinse the mouth with jade-like fluids.
Then malevolent forces cannot assail you,
And essence and *qi* will preserve the body whole.
To avoid all illness,
Always moderate the five pungent flavors.
Calm the spirit with joy,
Cherish *qi* to maintain harmony and purity.
Longevity is not a matter of fate,
For cultivation lies within oneself.
If one follows this principle,
Even from the common earth, one may ascend to the realm of the immortals.

A text says: Those who have not heard the Dao indulge their hearts, act contrary to life’s joy, exhaust their spirit in cunning, fret over gains and losses, toil over rituals, and pursue wealth with their bodies and lives. Unceasing in these four pursuits, the heart becomes diseased.

Tao Hongjing says: Among all things, humans are the most noble and intelligent, yet a hundred years pass like a traveler’s brief stay. Without intent to cultivate and nurture, one cannot escape the burden of illness and suffering.

**Joy**
A text says: Excessive joy harms the *po*; when the *po* is harmed, madness ensues. The mad lose their intent, and their skin withers.

Another says: Unrestrained joy and anger undermine life’s foundation. Harmonizing joy and anger in daily life keeps malevolent forces at bay, ensuring long life and enduring vision.

Yet another says: Unmeasured joy and anger deplete yin *qi* while leaving yang *qi* in excess. When constructive and defensive *qi* fail to circulate, paralysis and abscesses arise.

*The Assembled Writings* says: Joy harmonizes *qi* and smooths the disposition, allowing constructive and defensive *qi* to flow freely. Yet excessive joy injures the heart; accumulated harm leads to depletion. Thus it is said: Moderate joy spares the spirit from labor.

*The Huainanzi* says: Excessive joy topples yang.

Tang dynasty’s Liu Gongdu, who practiced life-nurturing, lived past eighty with light and vigorous steps. When asked for his method, he replied: I have no art—only that I never expend my primordial *qi* to fuel joy or anger, and my cinnabar field remains warm.

*The Admonitions of the Eastern Tower* says: When the heart rejoices, yang *qi* scatters. Thus, restrain joy to nourish yang *qi*.

**Anger**
A text says: Anger causes *qi* to rebel; in severe cases, it induces vomiting of blood. Moderate anger keeps the body at ease, but sorrow, resentment, and grudges shorten life. Prolonged glaring at the sun or moon damages vision.

Another says: Great anger injures the liver; blood fails to nourish the sinews, and *qi* surges upward. This upward rebellion causes vomiting of blood, undigested food in the stool, dimmed vision, and sudden fainting.

Yet another says: Suppress even minor anger. If it rages unchecked, the will is harmed, leading to forgetfulness, dullness, and aching in the lower back and spine, making it difficult to bend or stretch.

Another says: Frequent anger unsettles the hundred vessels. It also scorches the temples, withers the sinews, and hastens exhaustion. Even if death does not come at once, the five viscera will transmit the affliction until the end.

No medicine can reach this state; only by transforming the heart and altering the will can life be preserved.

Tao Hongjing says: Daoist teachings on nurturing life first advise minimizing anger.

A text says: Eating in a state of violent anger startles the spirit, causing nightmares of flight.

*The Huainanzi* says: Great anger shatters yin.

*The Discourses of Renowned Physicians* says: Most people do not live to old age because they fail to cherish themselves. They vent their anger to the full, accumulating toxins that attack the spirit, internally injuring the marrow and externally wasting the flesh. Righteous *qi* wanes daily while pathogenic *qi* waxes, no different from pouring the ocean into a candle’s flame or toppling Mount Hua to dam a trickle.

An ancient worthy’s poem says:
Anger burns fiercer than fire,
Consuming harmony in vain.
When provoked, do not contend;
Once past, the heart cools like ice.

**Sorrow**
A text says: Sorrow, emaciation, weeping, and panting disrupt the union of yin and yang, causing harm. Thus, mourning the dead or visiting the sick scatters the spirit of joy.

Another says: Sorrow stirring within harms the *hun*; when the *hun* is harmed, one becomes delusional and lacks clarity. Over time, the yin contracts, causing spasms, pain in the flanks, and inability to lift the limbs.

Yet another says: Excessive sorrow severs the pericardium’s network, stirring internal yang *qi*. This leads to ulceration below the heart and frequent bloody stools.

A text says: Excessive sorrow assaults one’s nature. When sorrowful, the heart’s connections tense, the lungs’ lobes lift, the upper burner becomes obstructed, *ying* and *wei* fail to flow freely, and heat *qi* lodges within, consuming *qi*.

Another says: Sorrow harms the will. The complexion withers, the hair dulls, and vitality is utterly depleted.

Jin Ne says: The lungs govern exhalation; sorrow depletes *qi* so it cannot circulate, causing the heart’s connections to tense and *qi* to dissipate.

Now, the heart governs the will, and the kidneys store it. Sorrow belongs to the Metal phase; when sorrow is extreme, one loses essence, the yin contracts, and as sorrow persists, the heart finds no joy. Water and Fire both depart, and spirit and essence perish.

**Anxiety**
The Yellow Emperor says: One who neither exhausts the body with external affairs nor suffers from internal anxieties, who takes contentment as duty and self-possession as achievement, will not wear out the body or scatter the spirit, and may live to a hundred years.

Peng Zu says: No one can be without thought, but one should gradually eliminate it. The human body is empty and insubstantial, containing only wandering *qi*. When *qi* and breath are properly ordered, no illness arises.

He also says: The Dao does not lie in busyness. Simply refrain from thinking of clothing, food, sound and color, victory and defeat, gain and loss, honor and disgrace. If the heart is not wearied and the spirit not exhausted, one may attain a thousand years.

Geng Sangchu says: Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts flutter restlessly.

The *Lingshu* says: Anxiety and apprehension harm the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, fear and self-doubt arise, leading to emaciation, dull hair, and a withered complexion.

A text says: Excessive anxiety and unceasing worry generate phlegm, which contends with *qi*, rising without descending, giving rise to the five types of *ye* disease—worry, *qi*, taxation, thought, and food.

Another says: Anxiety empties the heart, allowing external pathogens to invade. Panting and stagnant *qi* lodge within, frequently impairing digestion.

Yet another says: Anxiety harms the heart, causing retching and dry, brittle hair.

A text says: Excessive scheming and insufficient food and drink are the greatest perils to nurturing life.

When Zhuge Liang sent an envoy to Sima Yi’s camp, Yi did not inquire about military affairs but only asked about his diet and the complexity of his duties. The envoy replied: “Prime Minister Zhuge rises early and retires late, personally reviewing all punishments of twenty strokes or more. He eats no more than a few *sheng*.” Yi said: “Zhongming eats little and labors much—how can he endure long?” And so it proved.

Zhang Chengjie says: Taxation, as the classics describe its treatment, involves parasites—patients suffer in succession, yet this is entirely without basis. Consider the common saying: Once there was an ignorant man who secretly grew intimate with a woman. After parting, he could not let go of his longing, losing sleep and forgetting to eat. He grew gaunt and haggard, and though his desire remained unfulfilled, he ultimately succumbed to deep-seated *gan* disease.

A scholar, so absorbed in reading that he forgot to eat, once saw a man in purple standing before him, who said: “You must not think for long—if you do, I will die.” Asking who he was, the man replied: “I am the Spirit of Grain.” Thereupon, the scholar ceased his thoughts, and his appetite returned as before. For thought causes *qi* to congeal, trapping heat that cannot disperse. Over time, both *qi* and blood become deficient, and illness leads to premature death.

**Worry**
The *Lingshu* says: Internal injury from worry and anger causes *qi* to ascend in rebellion. When it rebels, the six transport points become obstructed, warm *qi* fails to circulate, congealed blood accumulates and does not disperse, and fluids seep and adhere, forming accumulations.

A text says: Worry injures the lungs, causing *qi* to become obstructed and stagnant.

Another says: Unrelenting worry over matters leads to lung taxation, with fullness and counterflow in the chest and diaphragm, and pain radiating from the chest to the back that never ceases.

Yet another says: Unresolved worry harms the intent, leaving one restless and unsettled, with limbs that cannot endure.

A text says: Worrying while eating startles the spirit, causing restless dreams and sleeplessness.

Another says: When a woman’s worry, thought, and weeping cause yin and yang *qi* to congeal, her menses become irregular—sometimes scant, sometimes profuse—with internal heat, bitter congealing, a foul complexion, and a withered, darkened body.

A text says: Deep worry and heavy suffering, with untimely rest and sleep, cause harm.

**Fright and Fear**
A text says: When one is greatly frightened by events and cannot dispel it, the gallbladder’s *qi* weakens, spirit and *hun* become unsettled, the heart feels empty and vexed, spontaneous sweating and bodily swelling occur, and food and drink lose their flavor.

Another says: Unresolved fear harms essence, causing bone weakness, paralysis, and spontaneous seminal emission. The five viscera lose their stability, yin becomes deficient, *qi* weakens, and one cannot endure.

Yet another says: Fright leaves the heart with no support, the spirit with no refuge, and thoughts with no stability—*qi* becomes chaotic.

A text says: Great fear harms the kidneys. If fear is not eliminated, the will is injured, leaving one restless and joyless—this is no path to long life.

Another says: Fright, fear, and anxiety internally injure the viscera, causing *qi* to rebel upward and result in blood ejection.

Yet another says: Fear causes essence to retreat. When it retreats, the upper burner closes, closure causes *qi* to rebel, rebellion causes the lower burner to distend, and *qi* ceases to flow.

There was a woman who failed to give birth for days. This was due to sitting too early in labor, causing fear and *qi* congealment. She was given *zisu* medicine to break the *qi*, and the child was delivered.

A text says: Facing peril and risk scatters the *hun*; playing with wild birds or strange beasts terrifies the spirit.

The *Huainanzi* says: Great terror generates madness.

Gao Fengchen’s nephew once traveled to Huishan. Returning at dusk, he encountered a giant man drunk and lying across the temple gate. Overcome with fright, he could not recover, and from then on suffered from frequent urination—fifty or sixty times a day. The heart and small intestine are the receiving and transforming palace. This occurred because fright caused the heart’s Fire to scatter and dissipate, leaving the heart cold and the kidneys chilled. Is this not proof of injury to the heart and kidneys?

A high official once sat in a temple when suddenly lightning struck the pillar behind him to pieces, yet his countenance remained unchanged. Another, sent as an envoy to Goryeo, encountered...

Amid towering sails and shattered hulls, others trembled in terror, yet one man sat serenely reading as if in his study. Had he not held such steadfast resolve, what manner of illness might have befallen him?

**Love and Aversion**
The *Daodejing* says: Excessive love必 incurs great cost; hoarded wealth必 invites heavy loss. Knowing contentment averts disgrace; knowing restraint averts peril—thus may one endure long. Excessive love of beauty drains the spirit; excessive love of wealth courts disaster. The more one covets, the more the senses are taxed. Only by knowing contentment and restraint can the body avoid disgrace and danger, and so endure.

The *Book* says: Love and aversion harm one’s nature and injure the spirit. When the heart harbors aversion, do not indulge deep hatred; maintain equanimity toward all things. When the heart harbors love, do not cling to it; if you sense partiality, correct it at once—lest it harm your nature and injure your spirit.

The *Book* says: Excessive desires lead to obsession and confusion; excessive aversions lead to emaciation and fear—these are the axes that hew away life. The *Huainanzi* says: Love and aversion exhaust the heart. If not swiftly abandoned, they daily deplete one’s vitality, preventing one from fulfilling one’s years.

The *Daodejing* says: The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears. Pengzu said: Lewd sounds and mournful music delight the heart and please the ear, yet breed dissipation and infatuation. Knowing this, one may attain longevity.

Confucius said: Look not at what is contrary to ritual; listen not to what is contrary to ritual. Mencius said: Boyi’s eyes would not gaze upon unseemly sights; his ears would not hear unseemly sounds.

Master Sun said: Eating the five pungent raw foods, consuming hot meals and drinks, gazing into the far distance, reading annotations late at night, lingering near smoke and fire, playing board games without cease, drinking wine without end, eating piping-hot meals, copying texts for years on end, carving intricate designs, indulging in excesses of the bedchamber, weeping excessively, reading by moonlight, stargazing at night, pricking one’s finger to draw much blood, reading after sunset, repeatedly gazing at the sun and moon, straining to observe mountains and rivers or grasses and trees, galloping in the hunt, braving wind and frost, chasing beasts against the wind day and night—all these are causes of blindness. Beware of them.

The *Book* says: The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes; prolonged gazing injures the heart. The essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears; prolonged listening injures the kidneys.

The *Book* says: Ears ensnared by lewd sounds, eyes captivated by beauty, the mouth craving rich flavors—these shake the five viscera and unsettle them, set the blood and qi adrift and unmoored, and send the spirit flying beyond restraint. Once the upright qi scatters, the dark forces of excess and depravity seize the opportunity to breed illness.

The *Uncle Shu* says: Gazing long at the sun, moon, and stars harms the eyes. Looking down wells shortens life. Thus, do not block wells or water channels, lest it cause blindness and deafness. Watching fights and killings knots the qi.

The *Book* says: Do all five colors harm the eyes? Only black-painted screens can nurture eyesight. The *Huainanzi* says: The five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear. The five tones clamor in the ears, rendering them dull.

It also says: How can the ears and eyes endure long toil without respite? There was a man of over eighty whose pupils remained bright and clear; he could read tiny script at night. He said: I take no medicine, but from youth I have never eaten the liver of livestock. Others, citing the *Materia Medica* that lamb’s liver brightens the eyes, doubted him. I replied: Lamb’s liver brightens the eyes by nature, but other livers do not. When livestock are slaughtered, their pent-up rage gathers in the liver. The liver governs blood, and thus is unsuited to brightening the eyes.

**Doubt and Suspicion**
The *Book* says: Persistent doubt leaves the heart without a master, the upright qi unable to flow, and external pathogens invade. Sleeplessness and loss of appetite follow; one sinks into silence, the qi and blood grow deficient, and gradually one falls into consumptive illness.

In the *Spring and Autumn* period, the Marquis of Jin fell ill. The physician He of Qin examined him and said: It cannot be cured—his illness is *gu*. Zhao Meng asked: What is *gu*? He replied: It arises from excess and infatuation. In the script, a vessel filled with insects is *gu*; in the *Yijing*, when a woman bewitches a man, or wind topples trees on a mountain, it is called *gu*. The hexagram has *xun* below and *gen* above: *xun* is the eldest daughter and wind, *gen* the youngest son and mountain. When a young man delights in an older woman, it is an unnatural match, hence bewitchment; when mountain trees are felled by wind, it is the same.

The *Guoshi Bu* says: Constant doubt必 leads to heart illness. Li Pan was ever suspicious of poisoning, so he sealed his well and drank only from it. The heart is the numinous palace; once assailed by external things, it never recovers. Doubt is the root of delusory illness.

Once, a guest at a banquet saw a carved bow on the wall, its reflection falling into his cup. He mistook it for a snake, and upon returning home fell ill. When he drank there again and realized it was the bow, he recovered. Another monk, entering a dark room, stepped on a raw eggplant and suspected he had taken a life. His mind dwelled on it incessantly, and at midnight someone knocked at the door demanding a life. The monk promised to perform expiatory rites the next day. At dawn, he saw it was only an eggplant. Such is the harm of doubt.

**Laughter and Talk**

The *Daodejing* states: "Block the apertures, close the gates, and one will not toil for a lifetime. Open the apertures, aid one’s affairs, and one will be beyond saving for a lifetime." This means that if the eyes do not gaze recklessly and the mouth does not speak recklessly, one will not suffer hardship for a lifetime. But if the eyes fix upon lewd desires and one further indulges in such affairs, then even unto death there will be no remedy.

The texts say: Laughter and talk should take the conservation of essence and spirit as their foundation, for excessive laughter causes the kidneys to turn and the waist to ache. The texts say: Excessive laughter harms the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, one becomes melancholic and joyless, disoriented and restless. The texts say: Excessive laughter injures the viscera; when the viscera are injured, the navel and abdomen ache, and over time the qi is depleted.

The Perfected One says: Those who do not know how to conduct themselves simply talk too much. One must guard against excessive speech to preserve qi and thereby safeguard one’s lifespan.

The texts say: Shouting beyond measure, engaging in disputes and debates, braving cold and heat, or indulging in salty and bitter foods will cause illness in the lungs.

The texts say: Walking while talking causes one to lose qi; when speaking much, one should pause before continuing.

**Saliva and Spittle**
The Perfected One says: One should habitually refrain from spitting on the ground. The saliva in the mouth is golden nectar and jade liquor. If one can go all day without spitting and instead hold it in the mouth to swallow, it will cause one’s essence and qi to remain, and the face and eyes to glow.

The texts say: Those who cultivate their nature should not spit far, for spitting far depletes both essence and qi, and over time leads to lung illness, heaviness in the limbs, roughness of the skin and hair, back pain, and coughing. Thus it is said: Spitting far is not as good as spitting near, and spitting near is not as good as not spitting at all.

The texts say: Saliva, when abundant, becomes sweet spring; when gathered, it flows as the Flowery Pool; when dispersed, it becomes fluid and humor; when descending, it becomes sweet dew, irrigating the viscera and moistening the body, circulating through the hundred vessels, nourishing the ten thousand spirits, strengthening the limbs and joints, and fortifying the hair, thereby ensuring long life.

The texts say: Within the joints of the bones there is a viscous fluid that enables smooth movement. When struck by wind, this fluid surges upward, causing a rattling in the throat. Medicines may be used to press it back down, returning it to the joints. If one spits out this fluid, one may feel momentary relief, but the hands and feet will wither, and even if one survives, one will be an invalid. In cases of infantile convulsions, this fluid must also not be induced to spit out.

There was a man who habitually spat out his saliva, and his body became withered and dry. Meeting a Perfected One, he was taught the method of returning the fluids. After a long time, his body regained its moisture. The human body takes moistening fluids as its foundation: on the skin they are sweat, in the flesh they are blood, in the kidneys they are essence, in the mouth they are saliva, in the spleen they lie latent as phlegm, and in the eyes they are tears. Sweat, blood, tears, and essence—once emitted, none of these can be returned, except for saliva, which alone can be returned. When returned, the vitality of life is renewed without cease. Moistening fluids are the treasure of our bodies.

The *Scripture of the Golden Elixir* says: When treasure is gathered, one becomes a wealthy elder; when treasure is scattered, one becomes a solitary, impoverished wanderer.

**Rising and Resting**
Guangchengzi says: Do not exhaust your form, do not agitate your essence, and you may thereby attain long life. The "do not exhaust" here does not mean to eat one’s fill and sit or lie motionless, causing the meridians to become blocked and the blood and qi to stagnate. Rather, one should simply avoid lifting heavy objects or grasping light ones, or remaining inert all day without ever straining the essence and strength to the point of exhaustion—this is the subtlety.

Zhuang Zhou says: There was a man who feared his shadow and hated his footprints, so he ran. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints there were; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without rest until he collapsed and died. He did not know that if he had stood in the shade, his shadow would have vanished, and if he had remained still, his footprints would have ceased. How foolish he was!

The texts say: Courage in daring leads to destruction; courage in restraint leads to life. For daring to act recklessly brings death, while daring not to act preserves life.

The texts say: Rising and resting without moderation, or exerting oneself beyond measure, injures the network vessels. Injury to the yang causes bleeding; injury to the yin causes discharge.

The texts say: Rising and resting at irregular hours, or eating and drinking without restraint, will cause yin to receive the harm and enter the five viscera, filling and blocking them, resulting in undigested food diarrhea or intestinal blockage. Pernicious winds and vacuous evils will cause yang to receive the harm and enter the six bowels, leading to fever, inability to lie down, and panting breath.

The texts say: Essence is the root of spirit, qi is the master of spirit, and form is the dwelling of qi. Overusing spirit causes it to falter; overusing essence causes it to deplete; overworking qi causes it to sever.

The texts say: Extreme exertion leads to panting, sweating, loss of blood, and depletion of qi.

**Walking and Standing**
The texts say: Prolonged walking injures the sinews, straining the liver. Prolonged standing injures the bones, harming the kidneys.

The texts on nurturing life say: When walking, do not stride hastily; when standing, do not reach the point of fatigue. Do not stand with one’s back to the sun.

The texts say: Running and galloping on horseback violently stir the qi. If the qi rebels against the diaphragm and has not yet dispersed when one drinks water, the water will clash with the qi, causing upward counterflow.

The texts say: Some waters contain sand-borne winds. When encountering such, do not bathe or ford; one should quickly cross with oxen or horses, and no harm will come. There are also water crossbows in some waters that shoot at a person’s shadow and cause death. One should strike the water with an object to scatter the crossbows, then cross quickly for good fortune.

The texts say: When walking while sweating, do not sit in the forest with legs dangling, for over time this causes blood impediment, foot pain, and lumbar ache.

The Perfected One says: When walking at night, one should habitually click the teeth to ward off demonic and pernicious influences.

Shen Cunzhong’s *Brush Talks* records: Among the grasses there is a yellow-flowered spider called the "heavenly snake." If one is stung by it and the wound is moistened by dew, the illness resembles leprosy, with the whole body festered and rotting. Those who traverse dewy places should beware.

The texts say: One should not travel far in heavy fog. When traveling, one should drink a little wine to ward off miasmic vapors. Once, three people set out early in the morning: one who ate congee fell ill, one who went on an empty stomach died, and one who drank wine remained healthy. Wine can fortify qi and repel miasmic vapors.

**Sitting and Reclining**
The texts say: Prolonged sitting injures the flesh; prolonged reclining injures the qi. When sitting, do not face away from the sun or sit in the wind and damp, lest one develop consumption. Do not sit outside beside graves, for the spirit will naturally scatter.

The texts say: If one lies down and is blown by wind, blood congeals in the skin and causes numbness; if it congeals in the vessels, blood circulation becomes impeded; if it congeals in the feet, cold reversal ensues.

The texts say: Sleeping with a lamp burning outside disturbs the spirit and soul. When lying down, one should lie on the side with knees bent, so as not to harm the heart qi. Upon waking, one should stretch and extend the limbs to prevent the spirit from scattering. Stretching while lying down invites malevolent spirits.

Confucius said: "Do not sleep like a corpse." The texts say: One must not speak while lying in bed. The five viscera are like suspended chimes—if not suspended, one must not make a sound. Confucius said: "Do not speak while lying down."

The texts say: Do not rest one’s feet on a high place while lying down, lest it deplete kidney water over time, causing deficiency and cold feet. The texts say: Do not playfully draw on one’s face with brush and ink while lying down, for the soul will not return to the body.

The texts say: If one is struck dumb in sleep, it means the soul has wandered outside and been seized by malevolent forces. One should call softly in the dark, but never shine a light, for if illuminated, the spirit and soul will not return, and death may occur before the lamp. Sleep paralysis arises from exposure to light—one must avoid fire, loud calls, or sudden awakenings, lest the spirit and soul be lost.

The texts say: Do not place a brazier by the head of the bed, for prolonged exposure to fire qi causes heaviness in the head, red eyes, dry nose, brain abscesses, and sores. The texts say: When lying down, keep the mouth closed to retain qi and prevent the entry of pathogenic influences. If the mouth is left open, one may develop wasting-thirst and lose one’s complexion.

Sleeping without covering the head promotes longevity. Washing the feet before bed prevents coldness in the limbs. Sleeping drunk in the wind causes emaciation. Sleeping drunk on a millet husk pillow leads to sores, severe wind diseases, and eyebrow loss. One must not lie facing upward during thunder, sleep under the stars or moon, or lie drunk in the wind while others fan them.

*Yinju* says: The sleeping place should be open on one side; drying clothes by the bed often harms people. The texts say: Lying down immediately after a full meal causes qi disorders, lumbar pain, undigested food, and accumulations. The texts say: One must not sleep exposed while sweating or bathe immediately after, lest it cause body tremors, alternating chills and fever, or wind rashes.

The texts say: When sitting or lying down, avoid drafts, especially for those who are weak or elderly. There was a man whose three generations did not live long; he consulted Peng Zu, who examined his sleeping place and found a draft directly hitting his occiput. After sealing it, the man lived out his natural lifespan. Drafts entering the ears and blowing on the brain scatter yang qi. The head is where all yang converges and life is governed.

**Bathing and Washing the Face**
The texts say: Frequent hair washing causes qi to stagnate in the brain and obstruct the center, leading to emaciation, heaviness, and long-term blockage of the meridians. The texts say: Washing the hair after a full meal, washing the head with cold water, drinking water while resting the head, washing the head with hot water, or soaking the feet in cold water all cause head wind.

The texts say: After washing the hair, avoid wind, do not tie it up wet, and do not sleep with a wet head, lest it cause head wind, dizziness, eye disorders, dandruff, hair loss, toothache, or deafness. The texts say: Women must not wash their hair during menstruation, for if they contract an illness, it will be incurable.

The texts say: Sleeping after bathing in stagnant water causes qi to accumulate in the lower abdomen and genitals, leading to kidney impediment. The texts say: Using overnight boiled water to wash the body causes rashes; washing the face dims its luster, and cooking rice with it causes mouth sores.

The texts say: Frequent bathing causes blood to congeal and qi to scatter; though the body may appear sleek, the qi is harmed. Those with abscesses and ulcers suffer from qi failing to overcome blood and spirit failing to overcome form.

The texts say: Bathing in cold water after recovering from an illness harms the pericardium. The texts say: Entering water while sweating causes bone impediment. Once, a renowned physician traveling to Shu saw a woodcutter bathing in a river while drenched in sweat. The physician said, "This man will surely die," and followed to save him. The man entered an inn, finely chopped garlic, washed with hot vinegar, and ate it, sweating profusely. The physician remarked, "Even the poor know medicine—how much more so the wealthy!" and abandoned his journey to Shu.

The texts say: Washing hands with cold water after extreme heat still desiccates the five viscera—how much worse is bathing? The texts say: When traveling in heat and encountering a river, do not wash the face, lest it cause dark moles. *Xianlan* says: Those with eye diseases must avoid bathing, lest it cause blindness.

Bai Yanliang suffered from red eyes in his youth. A Daoist said, "If you refrain from washing your hair, you will not suffer this." Yanliang heeded this, and at over seventy, he never again had eye trouble.

**Combing the Hair**
The Perfected One said: Combing the hair frequently dispels wind and brightens the eyes—it is the Way to avoid death. He also said: Comb the hair a hundred times. Tao Hongjing said: Bathe when full, comb when hungry; frequent combing and infrequent bathing benefit the heart and eyes. Thus, Daoists comb their hair in the morning, usually one hundred and twenty times.

The Perfected One said: The hair should be combed often, the hands should touch the face, the teeth should be clicked frequently, saliva should be swallowed often, and qi should be refined. These five practices are what is meant by "if you wish not to die, cultivate the Kunlun."

*Anle Shi* says: Hair is the surplus of blood; comb it once a day to circulate blood and dispel wind-damp. *Suosui Lu* says: Hiding tangled hair in the bedroom walls invites misfortune over time.

The texts say: Eating fallen hair causes abscesses. Emperor Ming of Song’s palace woman suffered from lumbar pain radiating to the heart, and when it flared, she would lose consciousness. Xu Wenxu said it was a hair abscess. Oil was poured into her, and she vomited a two-foot-long object with a head like a snake, which was hung on a pillar. When the water dripped away, only a hair remained.

Zhen Liyan of the Tang, serving as Grand Master for Ceremonies, encountered a patient with abdominal fullness, vexation, and itching. He diagnosed it as accidental hair ingestion. The patient was given realgar, and vomited a snake as thick as a thumb, blind.

Burning it emits the scent of hair. If the head and tail remain intact, accidental ingestion is certain.

For urination and defecation:
The texts say: Suppressing urine leads to the five types of strangury; suppressing it until the knees grow cold causes impediment. Suppressing defecation leads to the five types of hemorrhoids. The texts say: Straining to urinate chills the feet and knees. Holding the breath to force defecation causes lumbar pain and dry eyes.

The texts say: Whether from eating or drinking, riding swiftly, running in haste, or being assailed by cold or heat—if the bladder twists, pain arises below the navel, the bladder kinks and obstructs, and urine fails to pass, death follows.

The texts say: For the two matters of urination and defecation, do not forcibly restrain or suppress them. Nor should you lose measure—whether retention or incontinence, both harm qi and endanger life, bringing swift calamity.

Liu Weijian, arriving at Qianning Prefecture, was presented with *Golden Flower Pills* to reduce urination. The medicine contained *zhula* (arsenic sulfide). After three days of taking it, his urine became scant, and by the time he reached Bazhou, his limbs were entirely swollen. The waterway had been blocked, causing water to overflow and flow recklessly. Had he not encountered Lu Shu, he would nearly have been misled.

For when the water spring ceases to flow, the bladder fails to store. One should take warming formulas to gather water—only then may it be forcibly restrained!

*The Locked and Scattered Records* states: Urinating while facing the three luminaries (sun, moon, stars) or toward the northwest both diminish one’s lifespan.

**Clothing**
The texts say: Before the spring ice has melted, wear garments thick below and thin above to nurture yang and gather yin, ensuring generational longevity.
The texts say: In spring, do not wear thin clothing—it invites cold damage, cholera, indigestion, and headaches.
The texts say: After profuse sweating, changing clothes is best; washing quickly is also good.
The texts say: Removing only half one’s clothes after sweating invites hemiplegic wind, leaving half the body paralyzed.
The texts say: Do not wear damp or sweat-soaked clothes for long—they cause sores, wind rashes, and dysfunction of the two fu organs.
The texts say: When drinking alcohol causes sweating, do not remove clothes, boots, or socks to cool off in the wind—this leads to beriberi.
The texts say: In winter, with padded clothes, felt blankets, and the like, put them on quickly when cold and remove them promptly when warm.
Tao Yinju says: Do not suddenly add layers of padded clothing; when slightly warm, remove them briefly from time to time.
*The Locked and Scattered Records* says: "For peace and ease, neither remove nor add"—a northern saying. "For peace and ease, remove and add frequently"—a southern saying.

**Seasonal Avoidances and Taboos**
*The Inner Canon* states: Go out when yang emerges, return when yang retreats. Do not strain the sinews and bones or expose yourself to mist and dew. Violating these three timings leaves the body depleted and weak.
*The Canon* says: Do not brave great cold, great heat, strong winds, or dense fog. Heaven’s perverse qi, when contracted, harms the five viscera. Cold or hot food and drink, when contracted, harm the six fu organs. Earth’s damp qi, when contracted, harms the skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels.
The ancient worthies said: How can one’s single grasp of primordial qi contend with the great workings of creation?
Kangjie taught the four prohibitions against going out.
The texts say: Encountering severe cold that penetrates to the bone and marrow causes brain counterflow, headaches, and toothaches.
It also says: Failing to avoid heat and allowing it to take hold brings headaches, fever, and aching flesh.
The Perfected One says: Whether at home or abroad, if suddenly met with great winds, violent storms, thunderclaps, or dark mists, these are the passing of dragons, ghosts, and spirits—enter a room, burn incense, and sit quietly to avoid them. Only after they pass is it auspicious to go out; otherwise, they kill.
The texts warn: Do not weep on the first day of the lunar month or sing on the last—both invite misfortune.

**Regulating and Nurturing Through the Four Seasons**
*The Inner Canon* states: The three months of spring are called "Sprouting and Unfolding." Retire late and rise early. Nurture life and do not kill. Violating this injures the liver, leading to cold transformations in summer and diminished support for growth.
It also says: Injury by wind in spring results in undigested diarrhea in summer.
The texts say: At the transition of spring and summer, with yin rains and low humidity, or excessive drinking, one may suffer wind-dampness: spontaneous sweating, heaviness of the body, difficulty turning, and scant urine. Other treatments will not save the patient—only the *Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria* is best.
*The Inner Canon* states: The three months of summer are called "Luxuriant Flourishing." Retire late and rise early. Let the will be free of anger and the qi find release. Violating this injures the heart, leading to malaria-like illnesses in autumn and diminished support for harvest.
Tao Yinju says: Of the four seasons, summer is the hardest to nurture. With yin lying hidden within, the abdomen is cold and slippery—tonifying kidney formulas cannot be lacking, and food should not be too cold.
The texts say: Summer is the season when people shed their spirits. The heart, liver, and kidneys weaken, transforming into water, which congeals in autumn and hardens by winter. Regardless of age, all should eat warming foods to avoid cholera. With a warm abdomen, no illness arises.
The texts say: Summer ice should only be used to chill food and drink, not crushed and consumed. Entering the abdomen, cold and heat clash to form illness.
The texts say: From the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, be cautious of rich, greasy foods like cakes, pastries, and fried dough—these, along with wine, congee, melons, and fruits, are fundamentally incompatible. Most illnesses arise from this.
Tao Yinju says: Do not delight in cold pillows or frozen linens. Resting one’s head on cold objects greatly harms the eyes.
The texts say: In summer, do not sleep exposed outdoors—it thickens the skin, causes ringworm, or facial wind.
The texts say: Injury by summerheat leads to malaria-like illnesses in autumn. Suddenly encountering great cold invites seasonal illnesses.
The texts say: In summer, do not sit immediately on sunlit stones—heat causes sores, cold causes hernias.
The texts say: In intense heat, do not stand in the wind while sweating, nor come directly from midday sun, nor wash the face with cold water—these lead to eye diseases. Those with latent heat who drink water or are pressed by cold objects will die.
The texts say: In the fifth and sixth months, stagnant water in marshes often contains the essence of fish and turtles—drinking it causes abscesses.
*The Inner Canon* states: The three months of autumn are called "Balanced Containment." Rise early and retire early. Let the will be calm and peaceful. Violating this injures the lungs, leading to undigested diarrhea in winter and diminished support for storage.
The texts say: Injury by dampness in autumn causes counterflow upward and coughing, developing into flaccidity and reversal. Do not bathe on the day of the autumnal equinox—it dries the skin and generates white scales. After the first day of the eighth month, warm the feet with a small fire to prevent cold below.
*The Inner Canon* states: The three months of winter are called "Sealed and Stored." Water freezes, earth cracks—do not disturb yang. Retire early and rise late, waiting for sunlight. Avoid cold and seek warmth; do not let the skin sweat. Violating this injures the kidneys, leading to flaccidity and reversal in spring and diminished support for generation.
The texts say: In winter, if suddenly encountering great heat, do not accept it—seasonal illnesses arise from this.
It also says: Injury by cold in winter leads to warm diseases in spring.
The texts say: In winter, when heaven and earth are closed, blood and qi are stored. Exertion should not induce sweating or cold on the back.

The texts say: In winter’s cold, though near a fire, do not let its qi gather—do not dry or roast over the flames. If warming the hands suffices, cease; if not, it harms the blood, causing heat in the five centers. The hands and feet correspond to the heart.

The texts say: In heavy snow, those who have walked through it must not immediately wash their feet with hot water or drink heated wine, lest their toes fall off. When returning from the cold, do not consume hot food or drink before the cold has dispersed.

*The Discourse on Regulating the Spirit in Accordance with the Four Qi* states: The yin and yang of the four seasons are the root of all things. Thus the sage nurtures yang in spring and summer, and yin in autumn and winter, moving with all things through the gate of generation and growth. To go against this root is to sever the foundation and destroy the true. Therefore, the yin and yang of the four seasons are the beginning and end of all things, the basis of life and death. To go against them brings calamity; to follow them prevents grievous illness—this is called attaining the Dao.

Thus *The Discourse on Heavenly Truth* says: The wise align with yin and yang, distinguish the four seasons, and follow the ancients to harmonize with the Dao. This may extend life to its fullest span.

**Morning and Evening Avoidances**

The texts say: When going out early, hold a small piece of roasted ginger in the mouth to repel miasma and stimulate the stomach. Upon rising, do not see a corpse on an empty stomach—foul qi enters the nose, a white film forms on the tongue, and the mouth becomes fetid. If you must see one, drink a little wine first.

The Perfected One says: When rising at dawn, step down with the left foot first—this averts misfortune for the day, dispels evil, and wards off malign influences. If you can walk the Seven Stars step, it brings long life and joy. Also, speak only of good things at daybreak; if you hear something evil, face the direction it came from and spit three times—this is auspicious. Do not be angry in the morning or drunk at night, and avoid long journeys.

The *Canon* states: At dawn, a person’s qi is born; at noon, yang qi flourishes; at dusk, yang qi wanes and the qi gates close. Thus in the evening, withdraw and rest, do not strain the sinews or bones, and avoid mist and dew. To violate these three times is to weaken the body.

The texts say: When walking at night, run your hands through your hair to keep essence-demons at bay. Frequently click your teeth to repel ghostly influences. When sleeping outdoors, do not stretch or bend both legs together to prevent nocturnal emissions.

The Perfected One says: If you have a nightmare, do not speak of it. Once a day, face north and spit into water while reciting the incantation: *"May it become pearls and jade—auspicious."* There is a teaching for those entering a broad place: *"Do not be empty in the morning or full at night."* Now that the climate is irregular, this applies not only to entering broad places.

**Miscellaneous Taboos**

For bad dreams, tie them to grass or trees; for good dreams, record them.

The texts say: When passing a spirit shrine, do not enter lightly. If you must enter, do so with reverence and avoid gazing recklessly—this is auspicious.

The texts say: If you suddenly see strange lights or omens, suppress your surprise and do not react—this is auspicious. In Yichuan, where official portents were many, a report came of a ghost fanning itself, saying, *"It is hot, so I show this."* Another report said a ghost beat a drum; the response was to give it a drumstick. Fan Wenzheng was reading when a monstrous face approached him in the prefectural school at night. Fan wrote on its face with his brush: *"Your face is unusually large—you cannot deceive Fan Zhongyan."* Neither man reacted to the strange with fear, and the strangeness vanished. This can serve as a model.

The texts say: Burning animal fat for light disturbs the spirit, as it lies beneath the glow of blood.

The texts say: For wounds from blades, do not drink water, lest the blood not stop and you die. If bleeding persists, quickly apply a cloth soaked in hot water or immerse the wound in cold water; chewing mistletoe leaves is wondrous for stopping blood.

*The Locked and Fragmentary Record* says: When taking a flute or pipe from the wall, do not play it immediately, lest a centipede be inside. Master Liu Fuzhen, summoned to court, rose early and saw a shopkeeper’s wife collapsed on the ground, shrieking terribly. Seeing a blowpipe nearby, Liu knew a centipede had entered her. He bled a pig and poured the blood into her, causing her to vomit the centipede. Can one not be cautious?

The texts say: Ancient wells and deep pits contain much toxic qi—do not enter rashly, especially in the fifth and sixth months. First lower goose or duck feathers to test: if they spin and do not descend, there is poison, and you must not enter.

The texts also say: Mountains with caves or holes should only be entered in the third and ninth months to gather treasures. In other months, the mountain is closed and its qi is deadly.

*Three Yuan Extended Longevity Assisting Life*, Volume Three
Compiled by Li Pengfei, the Old Man of Clarity in Jiuhua

The longevity of the Human Dao is attained by those who regulate their diet. The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: "The generation of yin depends on the five flavors, yet the five palaces of yin are harmed by the five flavors." Bian Que said: "The foundation of bodily peace lies in food. Those who do not understand proper diet cannot preserve life." The chapter *Xiang Dang* records the Sage’s dietary moderation in great detail. Later generations, rushing after fame and profit, err in hunger and satiety; indulging in wealth and nobility, they pursue rich and sweet flavors. Disregarding the four seasons and disharmonizing the five flavors, they invite illness. Guard against this, and the longevity of the Human Dao may be attained.

**The Five Flavors**
The *Inner Canon* states: "Carefully harmonize the five flavors, and bones will be straight, sinews supple, qi and blood will flow, and the interstices will be dense—thus may one fulfill Heaven’s mandate." The *Huainanzi* says: "When the five flavors disorder the mouth, they cause injury and harm." Illness follows. Tao Hongjing observed: "Excess in any of the five flavors harms the person, for it may bring misfortune to the organs. A slight reduction in the five flavors refreshes the spirit. Even a slight excess damages the organs. This is the natural principle of the Five Phases: at first unnoticed, over time it becomes a malady."

Excessive sourness injures the spleen, causing the flesh to pucker and the lips to peel. Thus, in the seventy-two days of spring, reduce sourness and increase sweetness to nourish the spleen’s qi. The sour flavor, associated with wood (the phase of bending and straightening), overcomes earth (the spleen, which governs flesh), for wood restrains earth. Overconsumption of vinegar harms stomach qi, muscles, sinews, and bones, weakens men, and dulls the complexion. Do not eat it with clams, for they counteract each other. Some say: "A little warm vinegar wards off cold better than wine." Huang Yu remarked: "Having avoided vinegar since youth, I am now past eighty and still vigorous." The heart, whose color is red, favors sourness: small beans, dog meat, plums, and leeks are all sour.

Excessive saltiness injures the heart, causing blood to congeal and the complexion to change. Thus, in the seventy-two days of winter, reduce saltiness and increase bitterness to nourish the heart’s qi. The salty flavor, associated with water (the phase of moistening downward), overcomes fire (the heart, which governs blood), for water restrains fire. Excessive salt harms the lungs, darkens the skin, and weakens sinews. People in the northwest, whose food is not overly salty, live long; those in the southeast, who crave salt, live short lives. Those with coughs or water swelling should avoid it entirely. The recluses of Taoyuan in Jin times had no access to salt and thus lived long; later, when the five flavors became available, their longevity diminished. The spleen, whose color is yellow, favors saltiness: soybeans, pork, chestnuts, and water chestnuts are all salty.

Excessive sweetness injures the kidneys, causing bone pain and tooth loss. Thus, in the eighteen days of each seasonal transition, reduce sweetness and increase saltiness to nourish the kidneys’ qi. The sweet flavor, associated with earth (the phase of sowing and reaping), overcomes water (the kidneys, which govern bones), for earth restrains water. Honey and brown sugar are discussed under their respective entries. The liver, whose color is green, favors sweetness: glutinous rice, beef, dates, and mallow are all sweet.

Excessive bitterness injures the lungs, causing the skin to wither and the hair to fall. Thus, in the seventy-two days of summer, reduce bitterness and increase acridity to nourish the lungs’ qi. The bitter flavor, associated with fire (the phase of flaming upward), overcomes metal (the lungs, which govern skin and hair), for fire restrains metal. Bile and cypress bark are examples. The lungs, whose color is white, favor bitterness: wheat, mutton, apricots, and smartweed are all bitter.

Excessive acridity injures the liver, causing sinews to contract and nails to wither. Thus, in the seventy-two days of autumn, reduce acridity and increase sourness to nourish the liver’s qi. The acrid flavor, associated with metal (the phase of reforming), overcomes wood (the liver, which governs sinews), for metal restrains wood. Black pepper harmonizes qi, but overconsumption harms the lungs, causing blood to be coughed up. Long-term consumption of red pepper causes blindness and qi depletion; the closed-mouth variety is harmful. Do not eat pepper in the tenth month, for it harms the heart, injures the blood vessels, and causes forgetfulness. It dispels dampness, warms the center, and benefits women. The kidneys, whose color is black, favor acridity: millet, pheasant meat, peaches, and scallions are all acrid.

**Diet**
The texts say: Those who cultivate life drink when thirsty but not excessively, for excess harms qi, and thirst harms the blood. They eat when hungry but not to satiety, for satiety harms the spirit, and hunger harms the kidneys. The texts say: In eating and drinking, prioritize what benefits the person, and moderation is best. Overeating causes bloating and shortness of breath, leading to illness. The texts say: Eating outdoors, if a flying silk thread falls into the food and is swallowed, blisters form in the throat. The texts say: Store food in containers that are narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. If covered improperly, insects or rats may try to steal the food but fail, leaving saliva around the vessel; those who eat it contract jaundice, their bodies turning yellow like a goose, incurable by acupuncture or medicine. The texts say: Do not store food in copper vessels. If sweat drips into it, those who eat it develop malignant sores and carbuncles. The texts say: Raw and cold foods—people of the north, with their thick earth and deep water, have strong constitutions and do not harm their spleens and stomachs. Those who live long in the south should avoid them. People of the south, with their thin earth and shallow water, have weak constitutions and should not strain their spleens and stomachs. Those who live long in the north should be especially cautious. The texts say: Drinking water from places where wasps have crawled or cats and dogs have licked causes illness. The texts say: Avoid tea on an empty stomach; drink little wine at dawn and eat lightly after midday. The texts say: Eating to excess when extremely hungry causes accumulations; drinking to excess when extremely thirsty causes phlegm and masses. After eating at dusk, do not drink wine immediately to avoid retching. Emperor Taizong told his ministers: "My daily routine follows a regular pattern. I never overeat, and after long practice, I feel quite strong. Laozi said, 'My life is in my hands, not Heaven’s.' It all depends on personal regulation. You too should take care and not neglect self-cultivation." Tao Hongjing remarked: "Why seek cloud-eating or great elixirs to vainly aspire to the longevity of tortoises and cranes?"

Simply moderate one’s cravings in food and drink, removing the extremes, and one will find peace and ease.

Fermented rice water, according to the *Materia Medica*, is sweet and sour in flavor, slightly warming, and non-toxic. It harmonizes the center, guides qi, opens the stomach, and quenches thirst. It strengthens the body, unblocks the orifices, treats cholera, diarrhea, and wasting-thirst, relieves vexation, dispels drowsiness, regulates the viscera, and cures retching. It whitens the skin, leaving it smooth as silk, and is commonly used—so much so that its benefits are often overlooked.

The various boiled waters favored by the world are many and prized: aloeswood dries the spleen, *buguzhi* constricts qi, clove chills the stomach, and *ophiopogon* cools the body. All such waters cause harm in their own way. Drinking perilla decoction morning and night brings no benefit; fragrant herbs lead to the ailments of the wealthy and noble—this is one such case. Emperor Renzong of Song ordered the Hanlin Academy to rank boiled waters, and their memorial stated: perilla first, aloeswood second, *ophiopogon* third. They claimed perilla could descend floating qi in the chest and diaphragm, unaware that prolonged use depletes true qi, harming the person imperceptibly. The *Materia Medica* states: when consumed with wine, it softens the body and dulls the spirit—this is its toxicity, where harm and benefit coexist. Bian Que said: excessive drinking over time rots the intestines and stomach, corrodes the marrow, steams the sinews, harms the spirit, and shortens life.

A guest visited Zhou Ji, bringing two *shi* of fine wine. Zhou drank two *shi*, while the guest consumed eight *dou*. The next morning, Zhou suffered no ill effects—his capacity was accustomed to it. The guest, however, had died. Upon inspection, the guest’s abdomen was distended, his ribs had burst—was this not a case of exceeding his limit and violating Bian Que’s warning?

Drinking clear liquor and eating beef breeds worms. Wine that casts no reflection when held to the light must not be drunk. It must not be taken with milk, lest it cause qi stagnation. Wine left to sour on its own kills. Eating pungent mustard after drinking weakens the sinews and bones if consumed in excess. Sleeping after a heavy meal of millet and pork invites *da feng* (severe wind disease).

All cases of poisoning—whether from medicinal toxins or other poisons—are harder to treat when alcohol is involved, for wine’s nature moves through the blood vessels, circulating throughout the body.

The texts say: drinking cold water or tea while still drunk and parched draws the wine into the kidneys, forming stagnant toxic water. This leads to heavy waist and legs, cold pain in the bladder, water swelling, wasting-thirst, and contractures.

The texts say: fanning oneself while drunk in the wind invites *zi feng* (purple wind disease). Drinking water immediately after vomiting from intoxication causes wasting-thirst. Immortals do not forbid wine, for it can circulate qi and strengthen the spirit—yet they never drink to excess.

The *Materia Medica* states: when drinking tea, it should be hot and in small amounts; abstaining is even better. Prolonged consumption removes fat, making one thin and causing deficiency-cold in the lower burner. Only one or two cups after a full meal are harmless. For those with wasting-thirst, drinking tea while hungry is especially inadvisable, as it prevents sleep. Eaten with leeks, it makes the body heavy.

The texts say: rinsing the mouth with tea after washing one’s hands invites a thief into the artisan’s home—it may harm the kidneys.

Su Dongpo’s *Discourse on Tea* states: tea dispels vexation and greasiness, and the world cannot do without it—yet it subtly harms people in many ways. I have a method I practice regularly: after meals, I rinse my mouth with strong tea. It removes greasiness without the spleen and stomach being aware. Any meat lodged between the teeth is washed away unnoticed, sparing the need for picking. Since teeth naturally favor bitterness, this practice gradually strengthens them, and tooth decay diminishes day by day.

The texts say: drinking too much causes the lungs to spread their leaves, and qi rushes upward.

The texts say: do not drink from stagnant pools or flowing springs while traveling in the sixth month, lest it provoke malaria.

The texts say: drinking or feasting beside sacred images disturbs the hun and po.

The texts say: do not gulp water hastily, lest it cause qi disorders over time.

The texts say: exposing the body to cold and drinking cold liquids injures the lungs, causing counterflow qi, coughing, and nasal congestion.

The texts say: drinking plain hot water after congee leads to strangury and damp stagnation.

Tao Hongjing said:
*In eating, avoid greed and haste—*
*Better small meals in succession*
*Than stuffing the stomach at once,*
*Which harms qi, wounds the heart, and brings no blessing.*

The *Yangsheng* texts say: fine food must be chewed thoroughly; raw meat must not be swallowed whole. They also say: rinsing the mouth several times after eating prevents tooth decay and bad breath. Rinsing with hot water harms the teeth. They further say: wait for roasted or grilled foods to cool before eating, or they will injure the blood vessels and damage the teeth.

The texts say: eating cured meat upon which water from a leaking thatched roof has fallen causes *zheng* and *chi* (abdominal masses) and festering sores. They also say: eating meat into which human sweat has fallen produces *ding* sores. Eating the flesh of any animal that has died of itself breeds *ding* sores.

Tao Hongjing said:
*Avoid raw, cold, dry, greasy, tough, or stringy foods,*
*As well as the flesh of animals that died of themselves.*
*Steamed buns obstruct qi—do not eat too many;*
*Raw fish slices invite spleen and stomach ailments.*
*Fresh sauces, embryonic eggs, and oily foods,*
*Along with aged, spoiled, or pickled items—all are yin in nature.*
*If the elderly consume these morning and night,*
*It is no different from inviting bandits to arm themselves.*

According to the *Suosui Lu*: steamed buns obstruct qi, but plum-blood soup can disperse it. Dumplings enclose qi, but vinegar can break it.

The texts say: using ivory, gold, or bronze spoons and chopsticks can detect poison in food. They also say: serving food in lacquerware vessels will cause them to crack if *gu* poison is present. Those entering Min should be cautious.

The texts say: eating at midnight should be avoided; dining before *shen* (3–5 p.m.) or *you* (5–7 p.m.) is best. The *Rites of Zhou* states: music aids digestion, for the spleen delights in sound. Eating at night prevents the spleen from grinding food, as there is no music to assist it. In summer, when nights are short, this is especially to be avoided.

For foods that are neither beneficial nor harmful, ordinary people should still not overconsume them—how much more should the sick and dying avoid them?

This text records only those things that are either wholly harmful or of mixed benefit and harm—it does not record those that are purely beneficial. For items of mixed nature, it notes their harms but not their benefits.

**Fruits**
**Fresh jujubes** generate internal heat and thirst, causing qi distension. Those suffering from cold-heat imbalance or emaciation should avoid them entirely, as they disrupt the viscera and deplete the spleen’s primal qi. Eaten with honey, they harm the five organs.

**Dried jujubes** are cooling. They stir dormant illnesses and provoke coughing. Incompatible with crab.

**Plums** damage the teeth.

**Fresh longan** is neutral. Scalded in boiling water, it does not disturb the spleen.

**Fresh lychee** is heating. Overconsumption induces vacuous heat, vexation, thirst, dry mouth, and nosebleeds.

**Cherries** should not be eaten in excess by those with cold-heat disorders, as they trigger latent wind, injure sinews and bones, and cause vomiting. Children who eat too many develop heat—its nature is hot.

**Hawthorn** should not be eaten in excess, as it harms teeth and sinews.

**Milk oranges** are extremely cold. They chill the spleen, provoke painful illnesses, relax the intestines, induce light sweating, and are especially harmful to those with cold spleens and stomachs. All citrus varieties share this nature.

**Mandarins and pomelos** when eaten in excess dull the palate, making one unable to taste the five flavors.

**Oranges** are warming. Eating too much peel harms the liver. Eaten with betel nut, they cause dizziness, nausea, phlegm production, and malaria.

**Red bayberries** when eaten in excess generate heat, harming teeth and sinews.

**Apricot fruit** is hot. Overconsumption injures sinews and bones.

**Apricot kernels** (whether raw or cooked) are safe, but half-raw, half-cooked ones are lethal. Long-term consumption of apricot kernels causes blindness, loss of eyebrows and beard, and stirs dormant illnesses. Double kernels are deadly; ground finely, they may treat traumatic injuries.

**Peach fruit** triggers reactions in those who have ingested mineral drugs and harms the stomach. Overconsumption generates heat. Eating peach kernels on a full stomach and then bathing in water leads to strangury.

Peach and apricot flowers normally have five petals, but those with six invariably contain double kernels—these are lethal due to their abnormal nature.

**Plums** are neutral. They provoke malaria and, in excess, induce vacuous heat. Eaten with white honey, they harm the five internal organs. One should not gaze over water after eating them, nor consume them with sparrow meat. Plums that do not sink in water are poisonous. Their kernels, eaten with quail eggs, form indigestible masses in the abdomen.

**Pears** are cold. Milk pears and purple-flower pears relieve heart heat. Otherwise, raw pears are unbeneficial; overconsumption chills the center. Women who have just given birth and those with metal-inflicted wounds should not eat them, as they cause debility. While pears benefit the teeth, they harm the spleen and stomach—avoid them in the first and second months. There was once a pear as large as a bushel, presented to a high official; all who ate it died. Investigation revealed a giant serpent beneath the tree, which had concentrated its venom there—this was no ordinary omen.

**Other fruits of this kind** include:
**Actinidia (monkey peach)**—eating too much chills the center.
**Lingonberry**—overconsumption generates heat, causes qi stagnation, drowsiness, cold illnesses, sores, and putrefaction, and obstructs the pulse.
Its seeds should not be eaten, as they cause vexation.

**Pomegranates**—eaten in excess, they harm the lungs and teeth.
**Wild pomegranates**—mostly unbeneficial, causing qi stagnation.

**Chestnuts** are warming. Raw, they treat lumbar and leg ailments. Eaten raw, they generate qi; they should be sun-dried, steamed, or roasted. Overconsumption causes qi congestion. Those with wind-water qi disorders should avoid them. Raw chestnuts may be roasted in ash or fire until they sweat, which neutralizes their woody qi and prevents overheating. Raw chestnuts are difficult for children to digest; cooked ones cause qi stagnation.

**Persimmons** are cold. Sun-dried ones are cooling; overconsumption causes abdominal pain. Fresh ones are even colder. Red persimmons eaten with crab induce vomiting of blood. Eating red persimmons while drinking alcohol causes fatal heart pain, hastens intoxication, and fails to resolve alcohol toxicity. One variety, the tower persimmon, draws phlegm. Sun-dried ones often provoke wind; fire-dried ones taste poor.

**Wax apples** are especially cold. Eaten with crab, they cause severe abdominal pain and diarrhea.

**Grapes**—wine made from them dims the eyes when consumed to excess. Drinking wine beneath grapevines risks harm from insect droppings.

**Ginkgo nuts**—raw, they relieve infantile malnutrition and counteract alcohol; cooked, they benefit the body. However, overconsumption causes abdominal fullness. It is said that eating a thousand leads to death. This fruit blooms at the second watch and sets fruit at the third—it is surely a yin-toxic substance. There was a case of a family with difficulty conceiving; they made a meal of ginkgo nuts, ate their fill, and all died the next day.

**Water caltrop and water chestnut** chill the viscera, promote bowel movements, harm yang, and cause impotence. They do not benefit the spleen, are difficult to digest, and cause distension—ginger wine counteracts this. Eating raw water caltrop in the seventh month breeds pinworms.

**Water chestnut** is extremely cold. It stirs dormant cold qi and causes abdominal distension. Children who eat it in autumn experience subumbilical pain. Pregnant women should not eat it. Those in Wu who eat it regularly develop beriberi, paralysis, tooth damage, and loss of complexion.

**Water bamboo** shares the same nature as water chestnut.

**Gorgon fruit**—eaten raw, it stirs wind and cold qi, harms the spleen, and is difficult to digest, though it benefits essence.

**Lotus root**—eaten in excess, it chills the center but can dispel epidemic qi. For postpartum women, it is the only raw, cold food not prohibited, as it breaks blood stasis.

**Sweet melons** provoke wind illnesses. Overconsumption causes damp itching beneath the yin, sores, vacuous heat, abdominal rupture, weakness, and loss of strength in hands and feet. Eating small amounts may prevent heatstroke, but overconsumption invariably leads to diarrhea. The poor who eat them excessively in late autumn suffer from intractable dysentery due to yang depletion. Those with beriberi who eat them will never recover. Sweet melons that sink in water in the fifth month are lethal. Overconsumption induces jaundice, moves qi, and counteracts medicinal efficacy. Those with double stems are deadly; eaten with oil cakes, they cause illness. Prefect Chen Fengyuan of Yangzhou once ate melon to escape the summer heat; by autumn, his waist and legs ached so severely he could not move. He was cured by Scholar Shang.

**Watermelons** strongly resolve summerheat toxicity. Northerners, with their robust constitutions, are accustomed to them, but Southerners, with their delicate constitutions, should not eat too many. For those with cholera or cold illnesses, the condition may persist for life.

**Quince** is warming. The best variety has thin skin, a slightly reddish-yellow hue, fragrance, and a sweet-sour taste without astringency. The true fruit has a square shape on the side where the stem attaches—this benefits the spleen but harms the teeth.

If the quince is round and slightly yellow with a large, astringent stem, or small and round with a sour, slightly salty taste, it harms the qi; eating too much damages the teeth.

**Sugarcane**, when eaten in excess, causes nosebleeds. Burning its dregs and letting the smoke enter the eyes dims the vision.

**Rock sugar** is cooling. Eating too much causes heart pain. Consumed with crucian carp, it produces gan sores; with mallow, it generates flowing phlegm; with fermented soybeans, it leads to food stagnation, making the body heavy and immobile. Children who eat too much suffer tooth decay and pinworm infestations.

**Crabapples**, when eaten in excess, cause abdominal distension and are unbeneficial; this is especially true for the ill.

**Lemons** should not be eaten in excess, as they damage the teeth and harm the sinews.

**Pine nuts**, when eaten in excess, generate heat toxicity.

**Walnuts** are neutral. Eating too many promotes urination but causes eyebrow loss, stirs wind, and provokes phlegm, leading to nausea and vomiting. Consumed with alcohol in excess, they induce coughing up blood.

Eating unripe fruits with pits in the fifth month brings on paralysis, chills, and fever. Fruits that fall to the ground in summer and autumn attract noxious insects; eating them may cause the nine types of fistula.

Eating fruits that have been stored for many days or show signs of spoilage harms the person. All fruits with double kernels in their pits are harmful.

To treat poisoning from various fruits, burn pig bones to ash, take a square-inch spoonful with water.

**Grains**
**Non-glutinous rice** is cooling when raw and heating when cooked.

Unripe grains do not benefit the spleen, but overripe ones are excellent. Eating them with cockleburr causes sudden heart pain; with horse meat, it induces madness.

**Glutinous rice** is the same as *nuo* rice. If eaten with mixed meats during pregnancy, it harms the child, generates tapeworms, and with prolonged consumption softens the body and relaxes the sinews. Its nature is cold, obstructing the qi of the meridians, causing limb weakness, lethargy, excessive sleep, stirring wind, and provoking qi—best consumed sparingly.

**Forest rice** resembles millet but is smaller and can also be used to make wine. It stirs wind and should not be eaten regularly.

**Millet** triggers dormant illnesses; prolonged consumption dulls the five viscera and induces sleepiness. If children eat it, they may fail to walk, as it relaxes sinews and bones and severs the blood vessels.

**White millet** generates heat with prolonged consumption, causing vexation.

**Red millet** should not be eaten with honey; it can only be made into congee, not rice, as it sticks stubbornly and is hard to resolve.

All five types of millet, when eaten with mallow, cause madness. Storing dried meats among them and eating such meats obstructs the qi.

Those with lung ailments are suited to this grain.

Playfully eating raw rice over time leads to *mi zheng* (rice syndrome), leaving the muscles fatigued as if from overwork; abstaining from rice causes clear water to be vomited.

**Malt sugar** aids digestion and strengthens the stomach, but excessive consumption stirs spleen wind.

**Wheat** spans the seasons, sown in autumn and harvested in summer. In the northwest, heavy frost and snow render it non-toxic; in the south, with little snow, it may be toxic.

**Wheat** is slightly heating and mildly stirs wind-qi. To treat poisoning after consuming frost-damaged wheat, swallow three to five grains of Sichuan pepper with wine to prevent illness.

**Barley**, with prolonged consumption, benefits people, but when raw it is cooling and harmful.

**Wheat bran**, with prolonged consumption, depletes the kidneys and should not be eaten in excess.

**Buckwheat** is widely grown in western Sichuan; in Shandong and Hebei, it is sown in the first month. Those with preexisting cold-qi conditions should not eat it.

**Buckwheat** is cold in nature and difficult to digest. Prolonged consumption stirs wind and causes dizziness. Eating it with pork eight or nine times induces hot wind, leading to loss of eyebrows and beard.

**Millet** should not be eaten with apricot kernels afterward, as it causes vomiting and diarrhea.

**Broomcorn millet** is coarse and provokes thirty-six kinds of illnesses. Among the eight grains, it is the most inferior and should not be taken with *chuan fuzi*.

**Stale millet** and **stale rice** are both cooling in nature; frequent consumption leads to spontaneous diarrhea.

Storing dried or preserved meats among them for three months, then unknowingly eating them, harms the person.

**Mung beans** treat illness, but their skins should not be removed; removing the skin and eating them slightly obstructs the qi.

**Red adzuki beans** promote urination; prolonged consumption weakens people, causing emaciation, dryness, depletion of fluids, and heaviness in the body.

**Red and white beans**, when eaten with fresh fish, cause wasting-thirst.

**Green adzuki beans**, also called *hu dou*, when eaten with fresh carp, cause liver jaundice, and after five years lead to *gan xiao* (dry wasting).

**Black, white, yellow, and brown beans**, as well as all large and small beans, when made into fermented black beans, are extremely cooling; yellow sprouts and sauces are neutral. Excessive consumption causes heaviness in the body.

Those taking powdered soybeans should avoid pork.

If children aged one to ten eat roasted beans, then consume pork afterward, they will develop *yan* (obstruction) and eventually die from qi obstruction.

Some people who habitually eat tofu cannot be cured when poisoned. A physician, en route to treat them, encountered a dispute at a tofu-maker’s home and inquired of the wife, who revealed she had mistakenly used radish broth in the pot, preventing the tofu from forming. The physician applied this knowledge, administering medicine with radish broth to achieve a cure.

**Radish** is the remedy.

**Soy sauce** should ideally be made from beans, but today it is made from wheat and barley, and excessive consumption counteracts the effects of medicine.

The Master said: "Without its proper sauce, do not eat," for it delights the five viscera and fosters love—this too is a path to peace and joy.

**Sesame seeds**, when roasted and pressed while hot, yield raw oil. It can only be used for seasoning; further refining makes it edible.

**Sesame oil** stirs cold illnesses, lubricates the bone marrow, weakens the spleen, and if kept overnight, provokes qi. Those with spleen-related dental ailments should not consume stale oil but should prepare fresh oil daily.

**Black sesame seeds**, when roasted and eaten, do not generate wind illnesses; those with wind conditions who eat them daily will walk steadily and speak clearly.

**White sesame seeds**, also called *hu ma*, rest at the root and are restorative. Raw, they are cold; roasted, they are hot. They provoke cholera and drain people.

**Huashan sesame** is another variety of *hu ma*, with a bitter taste.

**Hemp seeds**, when eaten in excess, harm the blood vessels, roughen the yang, and induce seminal emission, as well as women’s *dai* (leukorrhea) illnesses.

**Vegetables**
**Mallow** is the chief of the five vegetables and is sown in autumn.

Winter mallow, sown early to bear seeds by spring, is called *dong kui*. Its heart is toxic and harms people. Its nature is cooling; when eaten hot, it also induces heat and oppression, severely stirring wind-qi. Frozen mallow, when eaten raw, provokes the five types of lingering fluids, and in severe cases, causes vomiting of water. Eaten with carp, it harms people. In all four seasons, avoid raw mallow, as it is indigestible and triggers all manner of chronic illnesses. It is forbidden with all medicines, as it provokes madness and six kinds of bites. Wu mallow, also called *shu kui*, should not be eaten for long, as it dulls the will and nature. If consumed while ill, the condition will never improve. Rong mallow, eaten with black meat, causes loss of complexion.

Raw scallions, when eaten and followed by honey, induce diarrhea. Eating roasted scallions with honey obstructs qi and causes death. Eaten with white dog meat, it causes bleeding from the nine orifices; those with qi disorders often suffer relapses, as qi surges upward, filling the person and closing off the five viscera, weakening the stomach, and loosening the joints. Eating it in the first month provokes wandering wind on the face. Generally, its function is to induce sweating, but in excess, it confounds the spirit.

Leeks, commonly called "herbal stalactite," may be eaten by the sick. However, overconsumption dulls the spirit and darkens the eyes, especially after drinking wine. They must not be eaten with honey. When unearthed, they become *jiu huang*, which harms people and stagnates qi. Their flowers stir wind; after the Qingming festival, they should not be eaten, as they are inauspicious for all and worsen cold in the heart and abdomen. Frosted leeks must not be eaten, as they provoke lingering fluids and inevitably cause vomiting of water. Eating them in the fifth month depletes one’s savor and vitality. They must not be eaten with beef, as it causes abscesses. After recovering from a febrile illness, they must not be eaten for ten days, as they induce fatigue. Scallions are also inadvisable.

Chinese chives, when eaten raw by the robust, induce sniveling. Eaten with beef, they cause abscesses. In the fourth month, avoid lotus roots, and in the three winter months, eating them raw causes excessive sniveling.

Garlic, or *da suan*, when eaten for long, harms the liver, weakens the eyes, and depletes yang. When boiled with fresh black carp, it provokes jaundice, causing *yi kan hui fa ming* (a severe condition). Only raw garlic is suitable; cooking renders it ineffective. For summer toxins, chewing it thoroughly and swallowing brings relief, but cold water must be avoided. Eating it in the fourth or eighth month harms the spirit, depletes gallbladder qi, induces panting, palpitations, and breathlessness, and causes internal sores, intestinal swelling, and hernia-like abscesses. Excessive garlic consumption before intercourse harms the liver and dulls the complexion. Northerners, being of sturdier constitution, suffer fewer ill effects from habitual consumption.

Small garlic must not be eaten often; eating it with raw fish seizes qi and causes excruciating pain in the testicles. Avoid it in the third month, as it harms the will. After recovering from seasonal illnesses, eating it with any food before intercourse will cause a fatal relapse.

Coriander, or "nourishing child," when eaten for long, induces forgetfulness, foul breath, worsens tooth decay and beriberi, and aggravates foot qi. Its root provokes painful illnesses.

Water pepper sprouts, soaked to germinate and eaten, when consumed in excess cause vomiting of water, deplete yang, reduce essence, induce heart pain, alternating chills and fever, and harm the bone marrow. Eating them in the second month harms the kidneys. Eaten with raw fish, they seize yin qi and cause excruciating pain in the testicles.

Daylily, also called "law of sorrow," when tender and eaten as a vegetable, stirs wind, causing a persistent stupor akin to drunkenness, hence its name. It provokes all manner of wind-cold. Those with heat may eat it without ill effect, as its nature is cooling.

Mustard, when eaten in excess, stirs wind-qi and provokes *hui shi* (a condition related to stones). Eaten with rabbit meat, it causes severe illness.

Turnips, or *man jing*, their roots must not be eaten in excess, as they cause qi distension. Their seeds, pressed into oil, darken hair when applied to the head.

Radishes weaken those of delicate constitution and should not be eaten in excess; raw, they seep into the blood. Eating raw green vegetables after recovering from a seasonal illness causes greenish swelling of the hands and feet.

All vegetables must not be eaten on the fifth day of the fifth month, as they transform into a hundred illnesses. All vegetables should be thoroughly cooked and eaten hot. Any vegetable touched by eavesdrip is toxic. Vegetables struck by frost in the tenth month, when eaten, dull the complexion, cause dry eyes, and induce lumbar pain. During bouts of malarial fever, the toenails turn greenish, and one becomes listless and fatigued.

Shepherd’s purse must not be eaten with calcium, as it causes oppression and provokes illness. It is forbidden with all uses of licorice.

Amaranth, when eaten in excess, stirs qi, induces vexation and oppression, cools the center, and harms the abdomen. Eaten with fern or turtle, it generates abdominal masses.

Violet must not be eaten for long, as it causes heaviness and swelling. Only one or two meals are permissible.

Oilseed rape, when eaten in excess by those with lumbar and leg ailments, worsens their condition, depletes yang qi, provokes mouth sores, toothache, and generates worms. Those with foul body odor must avoid it.

Carrageenan, when eaten for long, provokes chronic illnesses, harms the meridians, and dulls the complexion.

Spinach, when eaten by northerners with meat and calcium, balances them, but when eaten by southerners with fish and rice, it cools them. Eaten in excess, it cools the large and small intestines; long-term consumption weakens the legs and causes lumbar pain.

Water spinach, when eaten in excess, is slippery in nature, provokes hemorrhoids, and attracts epidemic qi due to the mercury it contains. In the seventh month, when wax insects infest it, it causes cholera and must not be eaten.

Celery from high fields is beneficial. That from black, muddy ground, called water celery, and red varieties harm people. Its nature is cold; eaten with vinegar, it harms the teeth. In spring and autumn, dragon essence enters celery; if accidentally consumed, the hands turn green, the abdomen swells, and the pain is unbearable. Drinking two or three *sheng* of granulated sugar induces vomiting of a lizard, and recovery follows.

Bitter greens, eaten in summer, benefit the heart. Silkworm tenders must avoid them.

Lettuce is cold in nature. Prolonged consumption dims the eyes. White lettuce, when eaten by those with cold qi, chills the abdomen. It must not be eaten postpartum, as it induces internal cold. Eating it with malt sugar generates worms. Bitter lettuce must not be consumed with honey. When grown near lotus, excessive consumption stirs qi; those with cold qi who eat it will surely rupture their abdomen.

Alfalfa benefits the large and small intestines. Eaten with honey, it causes diarrhea; excessive consumption emaciates. Bracken, when eaten over time, weakens the legs and depletes yang, darkens the eyes, induces excessive sleep, causes nasal congestion, and leads to hair loss. Children who eat it will fail to walk; those with cold qi who consume it suffer abdominal distension. Eating it raw forms snake-like masses. When Xijian, garrisoning Dantu, went hunting, a guardsman broke off a frond and ate it, feeling a faint illness in his heart. Later, he vomited a small snake, which was hung before the house and gradually desiccated into bracken—proof that it must not be eaten raw.

Eggplant is extremely cold. Those with the five taxations must not eat it, as it readily provokes sores, harms the body, stirs qi, and induces manic disorders. When well-cooked, a small amount may be eaten without concern, but those with cold conditions must not consume it. Eating it after autumn harms the eyes.

Cucumber, originally called "Hu gourd," is not beneficial. Those suffering from beriberi or edema will never eliminate the toxin if they eat it. Wax gourd, when white, stirs qi, provokes sores, weakens the legs, and is not beneficial for young children. It must not be eaten after seasonal illnesses, nor with fresh dairy or on an empty stomach, lest it cause heart pain. Green gourd induces forgetfulness. Winter melon, when eaten in excess, generates yin dampness and sores, and provokes jaundice. Do not eat melons touched by frost in the ninth month, as they cause blood-cold fevers and consumptive diseases in winter. Initial consumption may induce vomiting, and water may stagnate beneath the heart, or it may form foreign accumulations in the stomach. Those with cold conditions who eat it will grow emaciated. Melons dim the eyes, especially in the elderly. Poisoning from them may lead to malarial diarrhea in autumn. All bitter melons are toxic; those with two stems or two blossom ends harm people.

Bottle gourd, when eaten by those with cold qi, exacerbates illness and severely depletes vitality. Those suffering from beriberi or edema who consume it will never eliminate the toxin. Calabash gourd, when eaten in excess, induces vomiting.

Taro, also called "earthly tuber," comes in purple and white varieties. Eating it in winter does not provoke illness, but it must not be consumed in other months. Yam, also available in purple and white, is somewhat superior to taro. Small varieties called "mountain yams" are best. Galangal, when eaten in small amounts by those with cold qi, is permissible. There was once a patient with a boil who believed himself doomed, yet did not abstain from this plant. A neighbor prepared galangal and offered it to him, finding it delicious. He ate a large quantity and recovered. Several people with swollen cheeks were cured when I instructed them to eat it in abundance.

Bamboo shoots, when eaten in excess, stir qi and provoke cold accumulations. Water bamboo is slippery in nature and should not be eaten in large quantities.

Ginger must not be eaten on the ninth day of the ninth month, as it harms the spirit and shortens life. Dried ginger, when consumed in excess by pregnant women, induces internal dissipation. Bamboo shoots, when eaten in excess, cause spiritual confusion. Elm seeds, when eaten in excess, provoke heat and heart pain.

Fungi growing from the earth are called *jun*; those from wood are called *ling*, or wood ear, or mushrooms. New mushrooms with hair, those without gills beneath, those that glow at night, those that do not cook thoroughly, those that appear rotten but lack worms, those that cast no reflection when cooked and held to the light, and those growing in spring or summer where venomous insects or snakes have passed—all kill. Those who mistakenly eat toxic mushrooms often die laughing uncontrollably. Only by digging a pit, filling it with water, stirring, and drinking the clear portion can one be saved.

Wood fungi from paper mulberry, locust, elm, willow, or mulberry—these five trees’ ears—may be eaten, and are non-toxic in winter and spring. Wood ear, however, should not be eaten in excess; as previously stated, all such varieties kill. Additionally, red fungi that face upward without curling, and those growing in wild fields, are toxic. They also provoke cold qi, wind hemorrhoids, excessive sleep, and weakness.

Sweet chrysanthemum buds should not be eaten raw or in excess, as they generate tapeworms. Eaten with fish, they form foreign accumulations in the stomach. Cornelian cherry, when eaten in the sixth or seventh month, harms the spirit and qi. Eaten in excess with mugwort, it causes qi fullness. Asarum root has been known to kill those who consume it.

**Fowl**
Yellow chickens benefit the elderly; black ones warm the blood and are suitable for postpartum women. Those with five colors will drive the eater mad. Six-toed black chickens, white-headed domestic chickens, wild fowl whose young bear the character "eight" in their markings, and those that do not stretch their legs upon death—all harm people. Black chickens eaten with carp generate phlegm abscesses. Avoid eating young chickens on *bingwu* days. Do not eat hastily cooked chicken in the fourth month, as it provokes abscesses, armpit leakage, male and female consumptive taxation, and qi depletion. Eating it in the eighth month harms the spirit and qi. Pregnant women who eat it excessively will bear children afflicted with various worms. Pregnant women who consume many eggs will bear mute children.

Eggs stir wind and qi. Eaten with turtle meat, they harm people; with dog liver, they harm people; with dog meat, they cause diarrhea; with fish broth or meat broth, they form heart sores; with otter meat, they induce corpse transmission. Egg whites, eaten with scallions or garlic, shorten the breath; with raw scallions and dog meat, they cause anal bleeding. Those with rashes who eat chicken or duck eggs develop eye screens.

Chickens left overnight with improperly sealed storage will attract centipedes. Eating them without thorough re-cooking causes no minor harm.

Pheasants, being solitary birds, do more harm than good; prolonged consumption emaciates. Eating them in spring or summer is toxic; from the ninth to the eleventh month, they offer slight supplementation, but in other months, they provoke hemorrhoids and sores. Avoid them in the eighth month. They benefit the spirit and qi. Do not eat them on *bingwu* days, as fire governs them. Do not eat them in the fourth month, as they cause qi counterflow. Eaten with walnuts or mushrooms, they induce bloody stool. Those with dysentery should not eat them with buckwheat cakes, lest they generate fat worms and eggs. Do not eat them with scallions, as they generate tapeworms.

Ducks must not be eaten in the sixth month. They benefit the spirit and qi. Black ducks are slippery in nature and provoke cold diarrhea. Those with beriberi must not eat them in excess, as they are toxic.

Eating in excess during pregnancy causes the child to be born feet-first.

Wild ducks must not be eaten with walnuts or wood ear mushrooms. *Yiyuan* states: During the Yuanjia reign, a man from Zhang’an ate duck meat and developed an abscess. His chest became full, his face flushed red, and he could not eat or drink. A physician fed him glutinous rice, and soon he vomited a duckling, after which he recovered. This was caused by the meat being undercooked, or by overconsumption.

White geese have a cold nature. Eating them in excess causes cholera and induces manic disorders. Their eggs must not be eaten in large quantities. Gray geese provoke sores and pus.

Quails must not be eaten before the fourth month. Eaten with pig liver, they cause dark spots on the face; eaten with mushrooms, they provoke hemorrhoids.

Partridges are revered as spirits of Heaven and Earth. Each month, one is offered to the emperor. Those that die of themselves must not be eaten.

Pheasants, when eaten in large quantities, provoke the five types of hemorrhoids; eaten with buckwheat, they generate sores. They are akin to bamboo partridges.

The Southern Tang minister Feng Yansi suffered from chronic headaches that would not abate. The imperial physician Wu Yanshao questioned the kitchen staff, saying: "The minister has long consumed partridges and pheasants." Wu then said: "I understand." He administered a licorice decoction, and the minister recovered. These birds often feed on *aconitum* and *pinellia*, which are toxic; licorice counteracts this.

Additionally, *Leibian* records: Yang Lizhi, a judicial commissioner in the south, ate partridges frequently and developed a perianal abscess, with pus and blood flowing incessantly. Yang Jilao of Sishui instructed him to first consume a catty of fresh ginger, and he recovered. This was to neutralize the toxicity of *pinellia*.

During the Tang, Cui Weigong died suddenly after eating too many bamboo partridges. Liang Xin ordered that ginger juice be extracted by breaking his teeth and pouring it down his throat, and he revived. The principle was the same.

Mandarin duck meat, if eaten regularly, causes severe wind disorders.

Sparrow meat must not be eaten with plums. Eaten with fermented soybean paste, it is forbidden during pregnancy.

Pigeons, though beneficial, weaken the efficacy of medicine when consumed by the sick.

Female magpies must not be eaten by women. To distinguish the sex, burn the feathers and place them in water; those that sink are male.

Crow meat is astringent and unfit for consumption.

Swallow meat, if eaten, will bring harm from flood dragons.

When the cuckoo first calls, the first to hear it will experience separation. Imitating its call causes spitting of blood. Hearing it from a latrine is inauspicious; responding with a dog’s bark brings good fortune.

All birds that die of themselves with their beaks unclosed are lethal to humans.

---

Of all meats, pork is the most commonly used, yet it is unwholesome. Eating it causes sudden weight gain and induces wind deficiency. It obstructs the blood vessels, weakens the sinews and bones, and emaciates those already debilitated. It is especially harmful to the sick and those with metal-inflicted wounds.

Eating pork and drinking wine, one must not sleep on sorghum stalks. White pigs with white hooves mixed with black must not be eaten.

Pig kidneys regulate kidney qi, but eating them in excess causes kidney deficiency and, over time, reduces fertility. Rendered fat used in lamps harms the eyes; lard must not be mixed with smoked plum. Eating liver or lungs with raw fish or *you* (fermented fish) causes abscesses; eaten with carp roe, it harms the spirit. It is best not to eat them in the eighth month.

Pig brain damages yang, rendering one impotent before intercourse. Those who eat it with wine and soup are inviting disaster. Have they not considered that even the skin can be digested, yet they remain unaware of its toxicity?

Pig head induces wind, and the snout is especially toxic; those prone to wind disorders must not eat it. To mitigate harm, burn bamboo leaves to produce smoke and hold it in the mouth until saliva flows from the nose and mouth.

To prevent wind disorders, cook pork with galangal, mulberry root bark, gleditsia pods, and a small amount of yellow wax before eating. It must not be eaten with chicken eggs, as this causes fullness and discomfort.

Eating pork without ginger causes qi and blood to decline in middle age, leading to dark spots on the face. The Yu family states: Eating pork with ginger induces wind disorders. Another account says it provokes severe wind.

Wild boar meat mildly induces wind; those with black hooves must not be eaten. River pig, when eaten in excess, causes heaviness in the body.

Mutton is extremely heating. Those recovering from seasonal illnesses must not eat it within a hundred days, lest it cause bone steaming. Eaten with preserved fish, it harms the heart; eaten with raw fish or yogurt, it is injurious. Raw fat must not be eaten by those with latent heat.

The pearl-like white substance in the hooves is called "suspended sinew" and induces epilepsy. Eating liver with pork, plums, or adzuki beans harms the heart and causes severe illness. Pregnant women who eat liver will bear children prone to misfortune. Eating all types of sheep liver with raw pepper damages the five viscera, harms the heart, and is especially forbidden for children.

The stomach, if eaten regularly with rice by the sick, eventually causes *fanwei* (a type of stomach disorder) and *ye* (dysphagia). Eaten with sweet congee, it causes excessive salivation and vomiting of clear fluid.

The brain, if eaten by men, depletes essence and reduces fertility. Those who wish to eat it should grind it finely and mix it with vinegar. The same applies to pig brain; it is best not eaten.

White sheep with black heads, if their brain is eaten, cause intestinal abscesses. Eating sheep or pig brain after drinking wine is extremely harmful.

Sheep with perforated hearts are lethal. Those with a single horn are lethal.

*Gu* sheep are black-faced sheep. Their meat must not be cooked in copper vessels with willow or white poplar wood in water, as this damages yang in men and severs yin in women, causing incessant sudden diarrhea. Eating marrow and bone broth together causes persistent vexing heat and induces diarrhea. It must not be eaten in the sixth month, as it benefits the spirit and qi.

Eating black sheep liver with adzuki beans dims the eyes. Sheep must not be eaten with fermented soybean paste, as prolonged consumption causes leprosy and chronic illnesses.

Cattle that die suddenly in extreme heat are unfit for consumption, as they cause intestinal abscesses. Those with diarrhea will worsen, and eating it in the twelfth month harms the spirit and qi. Those with "resisting sinews" in their hooves cause "meat thorns" when eaten. Eaten with horse meat, it causes itching; eaten with river pig, it generates tapeworms.

Beef cooked over mulberry wood fire and eaten generates tapeworms. Those with cold conditions must not eat it. Each of the five viscera nourishes the corresponding human organ.

Beef from sandy-soil cattle, when consumed regularly, reactivates chronic illnesses. Horse meat from animals that died of natural causes harms humans—at its worst, it kills—and must not be eaten. Those with diarrhea who consume it will worsen. The meat must be thoroughly rinsed in water before boiling until tender, and all blood must be drained before cooking; the same applies to roasted fatty cuts. If toxins remain, it causes clove sores. Horse meat should only be boiled; other preparations are difficult to digest and must not be eaten in excess. Pregnant women must not consume it, and eating it in the fifth month harms the spirit and qi. If one feels heartburn and oppression after eating horse meat, drinking clear wine will relieve it, while turbid wine will aggravate the condition. It must not be eaten with aged stored rice, as sudden severe illness may result, with a mortality rate of ninety percent. Eating it with ginger causes qi cough. Those with dysentery who consume it will experience heart oppression. The blood is toxic; drinking fine wine counteracts it.

White horses with black hooves—eating their brains causes epilepsy. White horses with dark hooves—their meat must not be eaten. Those with black-spotted backs and striped forelegs—their meat must not be eaten. Black discoloration beneath the saddle that penetrates the flesh harms the five viscera. Using a horse’s skull as a pillow prevents sleep. After eating a dead horse, do not consume stored rice, as it triggers a hundred illnesses. Horse sweat, its odor, or its hair must not accidentally enter food, as they harm humans. The sweat must not come near the genitals; those with preexisting sores must avoid horse sweat and meat broth. Horse qi and hair are invariably lethal.

Horse sinew and meat, if not harvested in the twelfth month, should be fire-dried. Those with diarrhea must not eat horse heart. Horse hooves that resemble night eyes must not be eaten after the fifth month. Horse meat must not be eaten with deer meat.

Donkey meat from diseased animals is unfit for consumption. Mules, donkeys, and horses carry twelve-month pregnancies, and mules do not conceive—thus, their meat must not be eaten. Donkey meat stirs wind, especially when fatty. After eating it, one must not drink wine, as it causes illness and can be fatal. Donkey urine is slightly toxic; a dose should not exceed two *ge*. Ghee, butter, and yogurt are beneficial and harmless. Yogurt from sheep, cattle, or horses, if consumed immediately before heavy drinking, transforms blood and causes bloody urine. Cow’s milk must not be eaten with sour foods, as it forms hard accumulations. Donkey milk is too cold for yogurt-making.

All cow, horse, or donkey milk and yogurt, when eaten with raw fish, cause fish *zheng*. Boiling fish in milk or yogurt induces cholera. Grilled dog meat causes wasting-thirst. White dogs that die without protruding their tongues harm humans. Emaciated dogs are diseased and unfit for consumption. Pregnant women who eat dog meat will bear mute children. It must not be eaten in the ninth month to nurture the spirit and qi. Dog meat eaten with garlic harms humans. The blood, if removed when eating the meat, does not benefit. Dog blood eaten with sea bass causes severe illness.

Mad dogs—if their noses are red and raised with dryness—are about to turn rabid, and their meat must not be eaten. Sun Zhenren said: In late spring and early summer, dogs often go mad, so one must be cautious. The weak and small should carry staffs for protection. If bitten despite precautions, nothing surpasses moxibustion. The method involves moxibustion directly on the bite mark and above the teeth, once daily, for one to three sessions, with care taken to continue for up to one hundred twenty days. Immediately after a bite, boil and eat scallions daily for best results. This disease is grave, yet the world takes it lightly—it must not be ignored.

Deer and river deer meat are considered one and do not correspond to the twelve earthly branches. They must not be eaten in the fifth month, as it harms the spirit. Those with leopard-like markings kill humans. Deer velvet must not be sniffed, as tiny insects may enter the nose and cause insect *ke*, which medicine cannot remedy. Deer meat withers the male organ and must not be approached. White deer meat cooked with cattail shoots into a stew causes malignant sores. Master Huju said: Those taking medicinal tonics who eat deer meat will not benefit, for deer consume detoxifying herbs that disperse medicinal potency.

Leopard bone and meat can treat consumptive illnesses. River deer meat, from the eighth to the eleventh month, surpasses mutton in quality; in other months, it stirs qi. Musk deer meat, when eaten in excess, triggers *zheng* illnesses, for it consumes snakes and thus carries venom. Elk meat must not be eaten with pheasant, shrimp, raw vegetables, plums, or apricots, as all harm humans.

Rabbit meat, if eaten by pregnant women, causes cleft lip in the child. Rabbits give birth through their mouths—this is taboo, though suitable for those taking cinnabar and mineral medicines. It may be eaten in the eighth and eleventh months. Excessive consumption depletes yang, severs the blood vessels, and causes emaciation and sallowness.

Eating rabbit meat while afflicted with smallpox is highly toxic, causing ulceration and harm. Avoid it in the second month to nurture the spirit. Consuming it with otter meat or liver results in *dunshi* consumption. Eating it with goose meat obstructs the flow of blood and qi. Combined with white chicken liver, it depletes facial blood, leading to jaundice within a year. Paired with ginger or tangerines, it causes heart pain and choleraic disorders.

Tiger meat should not be eaten in the first month to promote longevity. Meat from animals killed by poisoned arrows retains venom in the bones and blood, which can still harm humans—do not consume it. The same applies to leopard and wildcat meat.

Pangolin meat, when eaten in excess, stirs dormant wind illnesses. Jackal meat is sour and inedible, as it dissolves human fat. Its flesh emaciates and depletes vitality. Otter meat only treats heat; for those with cold qi and deficiency distension, it exacerbates the condition. It disperses yang, harms men, and should be eaten sparingly. Its five organs and flesh are cold, except the liver, which is damp and treats consumptive *chuanshi* labor.

Elephant meat, when eaten, increases bodily weight. Bear meat must not be consumed by those with chronic illnesses, as it causes lifelong affliction. Avoid it in the tenth month. Its fat should not be used for lamps, as the smoke enters the eyes and causes blindness. It must not be applied near the genitals, or impotence results.

Musk deer meat, when eaten with pigeon meat, forms abdominal masses. In summer, musk deer consume snakes, and their lingering fragrance penetrates the body over time, causing strange illnesses. Do not let its scent near the nose, as white worms may enter the brain, leading to white granules.

Monkeys harm the resolve of children who come near them. Hedgehog meat is edible, but its bones must not be consumed, as they emaciate and shrink the body. Meat broth stored in sealed containers where qi cannot escape, the livers of birds and livestock that appear green, beasts with red feet or forked tails, meat that does not absorb water when boiled or remains raw after cooking, raw meat that contracts when touched, wild animals that die facing north with their heads down, sacrificial meat that moves without cause, animals that die without visible wounds, dog meat with hanging hooves or meat containing rice-like specks, lamb jerky infested with horsehair-like worms after the third month, and cured meat stored long-term in rice jars—all are lethal.

Dried meat that does not dry when exposed, does not burn when set aflame, or does not digest in the stomach; the livers and organs of dead animals; meat that appears fresh but carries a foul odor, harming qi and injuring the organs; meat or liver that does not adhere to dust when dropped—none should be eaten. All hearts harm the heart, and all blood harms the blood. Brains and spleens must not be consumed, as they harm humans.

All meat should be thoroughly cooked and eaten only when cooled. After eating, rinse the mouth several times to prevent tooth decay. Overeating meat can be remedied by drinking meat broth to aid digestion. Avoid consuming the five organs of birds and livestock on the third day of the third month for good fortune.

**Fish**

Grass carp with sores must not be eaten. Carp often provoke wind-heat. When preparing, remove the two tendons along the spine and the black blood. Those from sandy or rocky streams carry poison in the brain—do not eat the head. Carp from mountain streams must not be consumed. Avoid carp on the fifth day of the fifth month. After recovering from epidemic illnesses, eating carp causes relapse and death. Those with abdominal masses must not eat it. Paired with wheat sauce, it causes throat sores; with perilla, it provokes carbuncles. Pickled carp should not be eaten with small beans or their leaves. Eating cinnamon followed by carp forms abdominal masses. Fish and their roe must not be eaten with pig liver, nor crucian carp with pig liver.

The *Suwen* states: fish are hot. Wang Shuhe says: heat generates wind. *Rihuazi* claims carp are cooling. The *Suwen* is authoritative—those with wind illnesses who eat fish roe invite endless misfortune.

Mandarin fish with sores must not be eaten. Mandarin fish have twelve dorsal spines, one for each month, whose poison can kill—remove them entirely. Mr. Wang Shun of Suzhou nearly died from a lodged mandarin fish bone; fisherman Zhang Jiu cured him by grinding olive pits into powder and administering it with flowing water. When asked why, Zhang replied: elders say that oars made from olive wood cause fish to float upon contact, proving fish fear this wood.

White fish muddy the heart; those with sores or boils must not eat them, as it exacerbates pus and prevents moxibustion sores from erupting. Eating raw fish over time causes illness. Crucian carp heads must not be eaten in spring, as they contain worms. Avoid pairing them with pheasant, monkey meat, or pig liver. Their roe should not be eaten with pork, as it is slightly heating with garlic and slightly cooling with ginger or sauce. Eating them with *ophiopogon* is lethal, and with mustard greens causes edema.

Black carp and pickled fish must not be eaten by those taking *atractylodes*. Avoid pairing them with raw mallow, garlic, wheat, or sauce. Yellow croaker provokes qi, sores, and wind—do not eat it in excess. Combined with buckwheat, it causes loss of voice. Yellow catfish must not be eaten with *schizonepeta*, as it induces vomiting blood. Those afflicted may use earth broth as an antidote.

Seasonal fish, though delicious, slightly exacerbate chronic *gan* illnesses. Bream must not be eaten by those with *gan* dysentery. Snakehead fish should not be eaten in excess; those with red eyes and whiskers are lethal. Avoid pairing them with venison or scaleless fish. Sturgeon is delicious but counteracts medicinal toxins. Though pickled fish are prized, they are unwholesome. Those taking mineral medicines must not eat them, as they deplete qi, provoke sores and scabies, and stir wind. Children who eat them often develop abdominal masses and coughs. Adults who consume them long-term suffer sudden heart pain; paired with dried ginger, it causes paralysis.

Pufferfish are toxic and inedible. Yellow croaker are unfit for fresh consumption. Octopus is cooling but not draining. Pike is warming but not restorative. River puffer, also called *huyi* fish, is delicately flavored. Classic texts claim it is non-toxic, but it is highly poisonous—improper preparation kills. Those with red eyes are harmful.

The liver is highly toxic—ingestion causes instant death. For poisoning, olive juice or reed rhizome juice may resolve it. Sea bass does not readily provoke illness, yet excessive consumption may induce rashes, sores, and swellings; it must not be eaten with dairy. Loaches and eels must not be paired with white dog meat or consumed with blood. Eels, when eaten during convalescence, may cause relapse; overindulgence leads to cholera. Consuming them in the fourth month harms one’s spirit and qi. Those with yellow bellies are yellow eels; there are also white eels, slightly coarser in texture. Both stir wind-qi, and when cooked, may induce fetal ailments. Any fish lacking gills in the head, or bearing spots on the back, is lethal. *The Guest’s Tales from Maoting* states: eels and soft-shelled turtles must not be killed—large ones are toxic and fatal. A capital official fond of eels once overate, suffering violent vomiting and diarrhea, nearly perishing; thus, moderation is essential. Eel liver, when raw, breeds malignant sores—do not broil it with salt.

Cuttlefish, when eaten long-term, prevents conception. Black fish are taboo in water rites; those performing exorcisms avoid them. Eel, though toxic, treats consumptive illness. A prefectural judge’s daughter, near death from consumption, was sent by her parents adrift on a river. Cast upon a desolate isle, a fisherman took pity and fed her eel broth, restoring her vitality. A month later, he returned her to her family, fully recovered.

Horseshoe crabs, when eaten excessively, provoke coughs and scabies. Smaller ones, called "ghost crabs," are harmful. If fish pickles contain hair, accidental ingestion is fatal. Yellow catfish, when followed by mint consumption, kills. All fish toxins and fish-oil lamp smoke blind the eyes—this applies to fowl and beasts as well. Fish without scales react poorly to mint; those without gills induce epilepsy; those with intact gills cause paralysis. Eating fish without intestines or gallbladders renders men impotent for three years and women infertile. Fish with white markings on the head, resembling linked pearls extending to the spine, are lethal. Those with white eyes, white backs, black spots, red scales, or fused eyes must not be eaten. Horned fish provoke palpitations. Red-eyed fish, when made into raw slices, form abdominal masses; as pickles, they harm the eater. Eaten with vegetables, they breed roundworms and pinworms. For those with dysentery, fish worsens the condition, making it difficult to cure. All fish tails are unwholesome, often lodging hooked bones in the throat.

Fish roe eaten with pork liver fails to digest, causing grave illness. Pregnant women who eat dried fish bear sickly children. Fish broth must not be consumed with cormorant meat. Raw fish and melon must not be eaten together. Avoid fish on the day of *gengyin* in the third month.

Soft-shelled turtles, dwelling at the riverbed, are intensely cold and toxic—those with consumptive qi or abdominal masses must not eat them. Their flesh consolidates, while their shells disperse. When preparing turtles, file the shell and boil it together, then discard the shell before eating to moderate its nature. Those with sunken eyes, red feet, a "king" character beneath the flesh, or three legs are potent and lethal. Turtles with snake-like patterns on the belly are serpents—inspect carefully. Eating them with eggs, rabbit meat, mustard, or fermented soy harms the body. Pregnant women who consume them bear children with short necks. Avoid turtles, tortoises, and scaled creatures on *liujia* days, as they harm the heart and spirit. Turtles boiled with mint have killed. Eaten with amaranth, they breed turtles in the abdomen.

Master Chao records: a master and servant both suffered from turtle masses. The servant died first; upon dissection, a living white turtle was found in his belly. A man riding a white horse arrived, and when the horse’s urine splashed onto the turtle, it retracted its head. They promptly doused it with horse urine, and it dissolved into water. The master declared, "I shall recover," and upon drinking it, he did.

Unfrosted crabs are highly toxic. It is said that those who consume *shuigen* (water dropwort) and are then poisoned by crabs often die if not treated promptly. Crabs with star-like spots on their backs, missing limbs, a single claw, a single eye, eyes facing each other, or red-spotted legs and red eyes all kill. For those poisoned, quickly administer winter melon juice, perilla soup, or rhubarb juice. Pregnant women who eat them risk transverse birth. By the eighth month, crabs’ intestines contain true rice awns over an inch long, which they offer to the Sea God before winter; until the awns are presented, they must not be eaten. Avoid crabs in the twelfth month to preserve *qi* and spirit.

Eating persimmons or *jingjie* (schizonepeta) after crabs stirs wind. Greenish-yellow crabs may harbor wind-worms beneath; removing them poses no harm. Consuming crabs with unstrained wine causes vomiting of blood. Shrimp provoke wind, disrupt *qi*, and aggravate sores, ringworm, and cold accumulations. Those without whiskers or that turn white when boiled must not be eaten. Pickled shrimp with internal parasites are extremely toxic. Storing hot rice in a sealed vessel to make pickled shrimp poisons people fatally.

Eating shrimp *kuai* (raw fish slices) with pork often induces nausea, excessive saliva, and dulls the complexion. Snails are extremely cold and must not be eaten regularly. Consuming snails with clams and vegetables causes heart pain that recurs every three days. Creatures with shells, including clams, must not be eaten in the twelfth month. Ark shells, if not followed by rice after eating, dry the mouth. Clams consumed by those taking elixirs cause abdominal binding pain. Eating too many mussels induces vexation, dims the eyes, and causes mild diarrhea, which ceases upon stopping. Oysters, eaten in excess, provoke coughing and cold *qi*, depleting the kidneys. Razor clams must not be eaten after epidemic illnesses.

Turtles that are black commonly eat snakes and are unfit for consumption. Their shells must not be used in medicine. Avoid turtles and tortoises in the eleventh month, as they provoke water diseases.

**Insects and Worms**
Do not consume raw honey in the seventh month, as it causes cholera. Honey jars must not be used to make pickled shrimp, nor pickled shrimp jars to store honey; honeyed confections also deplete *qi*. For white-patterned snakes, remove the head and tail, soak in wine for three days, discard the wine, and roast over fire, ensuring the skin and bones are removed. This creature is extremely toxic and must be handled with caution.

Black snakes from Shangluo are now found in Qizhou and Huangzhou, all lacking three ridges. Glossy black like lacquer, they are docile, do not bite, and often linger in reeds to inhale floral scents. Those with tails long enough to thread a hundred coins are best. Merchants often counterfeit them with other snakes, smoking them for sale—careful inspection is required. Snakes with high spines are called "sword-spined black tails."

In Shangzhou, a man afflicted with *da feng* (severe leprosy) was shunned by his family, who built him a thatched hut. A black snake fell into his wine jar; unaware, he drank and recovered. The *Records of the Grand Historian* recounts a man from Sui who vomited everything he ate past his chest, mistaking it for a stomach ailment. The patient said, "I once had *da feng* and sought snake meat; the wind was cured, but this ailment arose." This was a *shejia* (snake mass), with a snake-shaped growth on his abdomen.

Severing a snake’s head with a knife will cause it to recoil and injure the wielder—this is called "snake arrow." For geckos, the toxin lies in the eyes, but the efficacy resides in the tail; those with intact tails are best. Dried leeches must be fried in lard during winter until yellow before use; remove those with eggs. These creatures are extremely hard to kill—even after roasting for years, they revive upon contact with water.

Stone leeches, with pointed heads and large abdomens, must not be used medicinally. Misuse causes unceasing smoke-like haze in the eyes, gradually leading to withering and damage—careful distinction is essential. A certain Wu Shaoshi fell ill for months, growing emaciated. After swallowing food, his abdomen felt as though myriad worms were gnawing and stabbing, itching and paining. All assumed it was consumption. Zhang Tui administered warm wine mixed with yellow earth, expelling over a thousand horse-leeches. He explained: "Last year, while leading troops, he drank from a mountain stream, and something entered his mouth, lodging in his throat—this was the onset." Worms entering the liver and spleen must multiply; when eating, they gather in the *dantian*, sucking essence and blood. When sated, they scatter. Over time, they kill—this must not be overlooked.

Centipedes with yellow legs are numerous but unusable. Chicken left overnight after slaughter, if not stored properly, attracts these worms. Eating it without reheating causes no minor harm. Silkworm droppings brewed into wine yield a clear, flavorful liquor that cures illnesses. Spiders with gray bodies and large abdomens, if their urine touches a person, cause sores and ringworm. Flower spiders’ silk is highly toxic, capable of binding tumors and severing ox tails. If a small amount lands on the genitals, it coils and does not cease—utmost caution is advised. There have been cases of it severing the penis.

Earthworms in summer, when stepped on with damp feet, can poison a person. Once, someone afflicted swelled in the abdomen, and at night, earthworms could be heard within. Soaking in salt water cured him. Another, Zhang Shao, was bitten, developing symptoms like *da feng*—his eyebrows and beard fell out. Whenever earthworms cried within him, the same remedy proved effective; he also drank saltwater.

The Immortal’s Method for Saving the World and Reversing Aging to Regain Youth

The Three Origins’ Dao—namely the Heavenly Origin, Earthly Origin, and Human Origin—bestow a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years. Mastering this art grants one such longevity. If one strays from the path, a single call may echo across ten thousand miles. Yet for the Heavenly Origin, sixty years are already fixed. If one loses it in the east, can it not be reclaimed in the west? Returning to seek it, one may then endure with heaven and earth, how could it be merely sixty years!

Before Qiao Song and Peng Zu, one should humbly defer, for this Dao is a secret guarded by immortals. When the lesser fire first ignites, striving earnestly to practice the truth may, in a single step, attain the realm of benevolent longevity—yet how is this possible? The Dao is not easily known. Even if known, it is not easily practiced.

By the age of sixty-four (eight times eight), the hexagram’s numbers are exhausted; mercury wanes and lead is depleted. To restore one’s primordial essence then is like digging a well when already parched—is it not too late? Cooking stones into congee hardly illustrates its difficulty. Alas, how can one claim to know the Dao!

When the *Bo* hexagram is not exhausted, the *Fu* hexagram will not return.

Yin does not reach its extreme, then yang does not arise. Knowing this principle, one may regulate this numerical pattern.

Master Hui’s *Inner Landscape Formula* states: Heaven does not collapse, earth does not split—why then does man alone face birth and death? It is said: Man moves and acts day and night, expending and dissipating primordial qi, failing to fulfill his celestial lifespan. When the six yang are entirely spent, he becomes a being of pure yin—easily perishing. Yet if he encounters an enlightened teacher’s guidance, earnestly seeking with unwavering faith, even at one hundred twenty years, he may still return to Qian. It is like an aged tree revived by grafting tender shoots—life is restored. When man in old age replenishes with true qi, he reverts from old to young. With diligent cultivation for one year, two ounces of primordial qi are regained, and the *Fu* hexagram reappears.

The Daoist scriptures say: Man is the spirit among creatures. His lifespan is originally forty-three thousand two hundred days. Primordial yang and true qi weigh three hundred eighty-four *zhū*, corresponding internally to Qian. Qian is the six yang fully present yet unknowing—through movement and expenditure, they are lost. From fifteen to twenty-five, ceaseless expenditure depletes forty-eight *zhū* of qi, leaving an amount corresponding to *Shi*. After another decade, another forty-eight *zhū* are lost, leaving an amount corresponding to *Lin*. After yet another decade, another forty-eight *zhū* are lost, leaving an amount corresponding to *Pi*. Here, at the midpoint of heaven and earth, qi is further unnourished. After five more years, seventy-two *zhū* are lost, leaving an amount corresponding to *Guan*. After another five years, ninety-six *zhū* are lost, leaving an amount corresponding to *Bo*. In the *Bo* hexagram, only the upper nine—a single yang line—remains. The immortal texts say: One yang line of qi ensures survival. Yet if one remains unaware, primordial qi is exhausted, corresponding to *Kun*. Kun is pure yin. Living merely by consuming grain is called a borrowed lifespan. At this time of borrowed life, if one does not contemplate prolonging it, how deluded! Yet nothing in the world is difficult.

Ma Ziran feared aging and death. At sixty-four, he sighed in resignation, yet eagerly sought the Dao. Encountering Liu Haichan, he received the secret of longevity, reversing age to return to infancy, thus attaining boundless life. Who was he? One to be emulated—yet the moment of awakening is but an instant. If one can awaken, embodying the *Fu* hexagram of the *Great Change*, accumulating day by day, month by month, primordial *qi* flourishes and flows. *Fu* gives way to *Lin*, *Lin* to *Tai*, *Tai* to *Great Strength*, and in *Great Strength*, true essence becomes pure and refined. The return of the *Qian* yang is then no difficulty. Among the five blessings of *Jichou*, longevity is one—without such a person, to whom shall we turn?

Yet this Dao is heaven’s treasure. If one can awaken to it, heaven does not betray the Way, but silently aids in the unseen, ensuring encounter with a perfected being—such as Liu Haichan—to fully reveal its secrets. Methods for nourishment, guiding and pulling *qi*, and returning to the origin are all listed below.

**Nourishing Remedies**
Sun the True Man said: After forty, fine medicines should never leave one’s side.
The Immortals said: Worldly affairs cannot be severed, but rare medicines cannot be taken too often. From this neglect, over time, flesh wastes and bones weaken.
Peng Zu said: To strengthen vitality and prevent depletion from the bedchamber, nothing surpasses deer antler. Grind seven *liang* of deer antler, steep in wine, and roast until hot. Take one roasted aconite root, then grind both into powder and blend. Each dose is a square-inch spoonful, taken with wine, thrice daily.

In former times, at Chengdu Prefecture, there was a Daoist with green whiskers and a radiant complexion who, while drinking merrily in a wineshop, sang:
*"Though the Dragon Gate may not withstand the drying of the blue sea,
The nine-fold refined cinnabar is all but idle talk.
Only the pearl from the spotted dragon’s brain
Can replenish the blood beneath the Jade Hall’s gate."*

This was a wondrous formula, now called the *Spotted Dragon Brain Pearl Elixir*.

**Ingredients:**
- Ten *liang* of deer antler frost, ground to powder
- Ten *liang* of deer antler glue, steeped in wine for several days, then boiled to a paste for pill-binding
- Ten *liang* of dodder seeds, soaked in wine for two nights, steamed, and dried
- Ten *liang* of arborvitae seeds, ground and separately refined
- Prepared rehmannia, washed in soup, steeped in clear wine for two nights, steamed, and dried, then added to the formula

**Method:**
Grind the ingredients into powder, then boil the glue in three to four *sheng* of wine to form a paste. Pound the mixture one to two thousand times until well combined, then roll into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take fifty to sixty pills before meals, swallowed with spirit-infused water or wine.

**Guiding and Pulling Methods**
At the hour after midnight when generative *qi* arises, or upon waking at dawn, or when at leisure with an empty stomach, loosen your garments and untie your sash. First, gently exhale the turbid *qi* from your abdomen—nine breaths or five to six will suffice.

Calm the mind, close the eyes, and click the teeth thirty-six times to gather the spirits of the body. Then, rub the backs of your thumbs over your eyes, nine times for each, large and small. This prevents obstructions, brightens the eyes, dispels wind, and supplements kidney *qi*. Next, press the sides of the nose seven times each until both inner and outer surfaces feel warm—this is called "irrigating the Central Peak to moisten the lungs."

Then, rub your hands together until they grow very hot, hold the breath, and massage your face without counting the repetitions. Continue until the hairline is reached, and the face will gain luster. Rub the earlobes and the curves of the ears without counting the repetitions—this is called "fortifying the city walls to supplement kidney *qi* and prevent deafness and dimness," known as the *Perfected One’s Daily Regimen*.

Next, press the tongue against the upper palate, swirl the saliva inside and outside the mouth until it fills, then swallow it in three gulps, repeating this three times for a total of nine swallows. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"Swallowing the numinous fluid keeps the body from drying out."*

Then, sit in utter stillness, the mind merging with the Great Void, the body as if cast-off clothing, all myriad cares dispelled. With long practice, *qi* and blood will flow smoothly, and longevity will naturally follow.

Additionally, the *Yongquan* points on the soles of both feet: grasp one foot with one hand and rub the point one hundred and twenty times with the other. This dispels wind, removes dampness, and strengthens the legs. The late Master Ouyang Wenzhong practiced this with great efficacy.

**Returning to the Origin: Illustrated**

The *Qian* hexagram embodies yang’s unyielding strength. The germ of life is inherently complete, yet once yin’s softness overcomes it, it becomes pregnancy, motion, stagnation, contemplation, and decay. When decay reaches its extreme, it becomes the *Kun* hexagram. *Kun* is pure yin. When yin reaches its extreme, it governs destruction. Yet if one knows where return lies, the ripe fruit remains uneaten. Yin at its extreme yields to yang’s stillness. When extremity stirs, the germ of life surges forth anew.

*Kun* is yin. When yin reaches its limit, yang returns. Yin is human desire; yang is Heaven’s principle. Using principle to restrain desire, yang grows as yin wanes. The danger lies only in failing to return. If one does not stray, return gives way to approach, approach to peace, peace to great strength, great strength to resolution. Resolution means decisive action. Once decisive, pure *Qian* is restored, and one may once more embody Heaven’s ceaseless vigor, attaining a lifespan equal to Heaven’s.

When the mind of Dao fades and the human mind prevails, it is like the moon from its first crescent to darkness. When human desire is exhausted and Heaven’s principle returns, it is like the moon from dawn to fullness.

*Divine Immortals’ Admonitions to the World*
The Yellow Emperor Asks About the Flourishing and Decline of *Qi*

Qibo replied: At ten years of age, the five viscera begin to stabilize, blood and qi flow freely, true qi resides below, and one delights in running. At twenty, blood and qi begin to flourish, muscles and flesh grow, and one delights in hurrying. At thirty, the five viscera are fully stabilized, muscles become firm, blood vessels are full, and one delights in walking. At forty, the viscera and bowels, the twelve sinews and vessels, all reach their full and settled state; the skin’s texture begins to loosen, luster fades, hair turns gray at the temples, and one’s prime remains unshaken—one delights in sitting. At fifty, the liver’s qi begins to decline, the liver’s lobes thin, gallbladder fluid diminishes, and the eyes grow dim. At sixty, the heart’s qi begins to wane, one is prone to sorrow and grief, blood and qi grow sluggish, and one delights in lying down. At seventy, the spleen’s qi is depleted, and the skin withers. At eighty, the lungs’ qi declines, the *po* departs, and thus one’s speech becomes erratic. At ninety, the kidneys’ qi is parched, the four viscera and meridians grow empty. At one hundred, the five viscera are all depleted, spirit and qi depart, and only the physical form remains.

The *Classic* states: At forty, *yin* qi doubles; at fifty, the liver’s qi declines; at sixty, the sinews can no longer move, essence and qi diminish—one must be cautious and restrained. If one knows how to regulate and nurture oneself in youth, how can this not be the foundation of nourishing life? After seventy, one should cultivate one’s nature and nurture oneself, avoiding mental strain and physical toil, and guarding against cold and heat. If one can harmonize with the qi of the four seasons, one will naturally enjoy health and longevity. To seek greedily as in one’s prime, unaware of what is possible, is folly.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* says: In nurturing life, to avoid harm is the art of extending years; to avoid harm through supplementation is the principle of preserving health. Dwell in safety yet contemplate danger, prevent what has not yet sprouted. Do not dismiss small evils as harmless and neglect to remove them, nor dismiss small goods as inconsequential and fail to practice them. Even if one incurs harm in youth, leaving qi weak and the body withered, if one awakens in later years, prevents calamity, and supplements deficiencies, qi and blood will become abundant, spirit will be full—naturally, one attains long life.

**On the Extension of Life Through Hidden Virtue**
A single moment of awakening is what secures the longevity of the Three Origins. The cultivation of a single virtue is what nourishes the vitality of the Three Origins. Profound indeed is the pulse of life—awakening cannot be neglected, nor can the cultivation of virtue.

*Laozi* said: "My life rests with me, not with Heaven."
The Perfected of Purple Yang said: "The great elixir is cultivated with ease or difficulty—it depends on me, and it depends on Heaven. Without accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue, myriad demons will arise as obstacles. How can one rely solely on self-confidence?"

The Daoist Guo Taishi was skilled in discoursing on the heavens. His works on celestial patterns were revered, and later astrologers, in their calculations, invariably came to study his methods. They spoke of the Five Phases and Four Pillars, of stellar configurations and fateful limits. Thus, wealth and nobility, longevity and honor; thus, poverty and lowliness, illness and suffering; thus, misfortune and early death—all were as clear as reflections in a mirror, as precise as tally marks in accord. It seemed that people could not escape their destined allotment. Yet upon closer examination, while many cases aligned with his writings, not a few did not. Why was this? Could it be that human life in the cosmos is sometimes bound by fate, and sometimes not?

I have examined his works: though his earlier sections meticulously expound the profound and subtle, in the end he states that hidden merit can extend one’s years, and a virtuous person may still avoid misfortune. He also says: "Respond to circumstances with timely acts of kindness, and even if one encounters inauspicious stars, there is nothing to fear." He must have had insight into this. Otherwise, why would he say that longevity and early death are not merely a matter of fate, and that cultivation depends on the individual?

Why did Sun Simiao make such statements? Xu Laile, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, once encountered the Longevity Star of the Southern Dipper and inquired about matters of longevity and early death. The Star Lord replied: "The Dao of Heaven blesses the good and punishes the excessive; divine spirits reward the virtuous and penalize the rebellious. If one can devote oneself to goodness, remain still in harmony with the Dao, and act in accord with fortune, then one’s life rests with oneself, not with the Executioner of Fate. One does not seek longevity yet attains it naturally; one does not seek life yet lives on. But if one undermines the moral order, defies Heaven and Earth, indulges in folly and perversity, insults the divine, turns away from benevolence and mercy, and neglects loyalty and filial piety, then in the manifest realm, the law will punish them; in the hidden realm, spirits will condemn them. Unaware of what they have accumulated, in darkness their allotted years are stolen, and they die young. As for those who attain longevity—hidden virtue, like that of Yu the prison officer who adjudicated cases for his son, or Chancellor Xu Qing, whose ceaseless accumulation of goodness led to uncounted ranks of nobility—is beyond measure.

Once, a bhikṣu attained the six supernatural powers and dwelled in the wilderness with a śrāmaṇera. The bhikṣu knew the śrāmaṇera would die in seven days, so he said: "Your parents miss you; you may return home temporarily and come back on the eighth day." The śrāmaṇera returned on the eighth day as predicted. The bhikṣu, surprised, entered samādhi to investigate and discovered that on his way back, the śrāmaṇera had removed his robe to dam a stream, preventing water from flooding an ant nest. Thus, his life was extended by twelve years.

When Sun Shu’ao was a child, he saw a two-headed snake and, fearing others might see it, killed and buried it. His mother said: "I have heard that those who possess hidden virtue receive Heaven’s blessings. You will not die." Later, he became the Prime Minister of Chu.

Dou Yujun once dreamed of his grandfather, who said: "You are past the age of having children, and your life will not be long. You should cultivate hidden virtue early." From then on, Yujun practiced virtue tirelessly. Later, he dreamed again of his grandfather, who said: "Heaven, in recognition of your hidden virtue, has extended your life by thirty-six years, granted you five sons, and bestowed honor and prominence." Later, he attained the rank of a Cavernous Heaven Immortal, and Fan Zhongyan wrote an account of his deeds.

From this, we see that the longevity of the Three Origins is indeed secured by a single moment of awakening, and the vitality of the Three Origins rests upon the cultivation of a single virtue.

Some may ask: How does one cultivate hidden virtue?
I say: In cultivation, one is not constrained by wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, nor does one force what one lacks. Rather, wherever one encounters water, fire, bandits, hunger, cold, illness, legal oppression, hardship in travel, perilous straits, or even the flight of birds, the movement of beasts, or the life of plants—wherever one’s strength reaches, one practices kindness in myriad ways. Thus, hidden virtue knows no limit, and the rewards one receives will be likewise boundless. How excellent this is!

The *Record of Western Mountain* states: When one encounters a perfected being and obtains the true method, though it may seem the result of self-cultivation, it is also the reward of hidden virtue. This is why, following the *Book of Assisting and Augmenting*, I have composed this treatise, *Hidden Virtue Prolongs Life*.

**Song of the Three-in-One Diagram**
Heaven, Earth, and Human—three Origins,
Each Origin spans sixty years.
Three sixes make one hundred eighty—
Such is the lifespan granted by Heaven.
Heaven bestows it in full,
Yet humans often stray from its wholeness.
There is a method to preserve it,
But alas, it is rarely transmitted in the world.
The *Three-in-One Diagram*,
Subtly explores the Primordial Ultimate’s essence.
Externally round, internally square,
One Kun and one Qian.
Its fixed form embodies Kun’s image,
Its wondrous function circulates Qian’s round.
Longevity lies within its inquiry,
Attained naturally in its truth.
Each year, add a single mark,
Gradually matching the shoulders of Qiao and Peng.
Without awakening to the method of *Assisting and Augmenting*,
The marks may never be complete.
This book holds the immortals’ secret,
Those who grasp it become longevity immortals.
Their complexions like Yan and Zhu, temples ever green,
Marrow full, bones strong and firm.
Not only will the marks on the diagram be fulfilled,
But Heaven and Earth will revolve in harmony.

*Book of Assisting and Augmenting the Three Origins to Prolong Life, Scroll Five* concludes.
