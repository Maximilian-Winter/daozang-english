**Preface to the *Essential Record for Preserving Life***

I have often heard that the pine may endure for a thousand years, while snow cannot hold its form for even a single moment. If one plants a pine in rotten soil, it will surely decay within months; if one stores snow in a shaded mountain, it may remain unmelted for years on end. That which defies its nature becomes brittle though once firm, while that which follows its principle may endure though once fleeting—such is the way of things, and how could human affairs differ?

Thus, how could the arts of nurturing and regulating life be neglected?

I have perused the works of earlier scholars on preserving life, yet they are often bound by excessive taboos and overly intricate methods, making practice difficult. For those of high rank, such regimens are even harder to follow. In my youth, I suffered frequent illness and turned my attention to the cultivation of life. After long study, I have compiled this work, which is simple and easy to practice in moments of leisure. First, one must secure the upright *qi*; next, one must harmonize the limbs and body. As for clothing, shelter, medicinal formulas, and the properties of vegetables, fruits, fowl, and fish—what is beneficial is recorded, while what offers no aid is omitted. Where ancient formulas err, I clarify them; where common practices stray, I correct them. Thus, I title this work the *Essential Record for Preserving Life*. Though it may not greatly aid in attaining the Dao, it roughly serves the purpose of safeguarding health. With trepidation, I present it, prostrating in awe.

**Essential Record for Preserving Life**

**By Pu Qian’guan, Gentleman for Consultation**

**Nurturing Spirit and Qi**
Jī Xūyè said: "To take medicine seeking sweat, one may yet fail to obtain it. But when shameful thoughts arise, sweat flows freely." When emotions arise within and manifest without, one knows that joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—none fail to harm the person. Thus, if the heart remains unperturbed, the spirit does not weary; if the spirit does not weary, the *qi* does not scatter; if the *qi* does not scatter, the body is at peace and life is prolonged.

**Regulating the Limbs and Body**
For those who cultivate life, the body should engage in light labor, never to the point of exhaustion. Thus, water flows and remains clear; when stagnant, it becomes foul. The one who nurtures life desires the blood and vessels to flow ceaselessly, like water in motion. One should not sit to the point of fatigue nor walk to the point of weariness. Frequent movement, though gentle, is the art of light labor. Therefore, the hands and feet should often bend and stretch; the arms should pull left and right as if drawing a bow, or both hands should press outward as if lifting a stone. One may punch the air with clenched fists, swing the arms lightly left and right or forward and back, turn the head and neck to look left and right, twist the waist and hips, or bow and lift the head. The hands may grasp each other and twist gently as if washing them, or rub the palms together until warm to cover the eyes and massage the face. When idle, one may perform these movements at will, each ten times or so. Practicing them daily ensures a light body, bright eyes, supple joints, smooth blood and *qi*, easy digestion, and no stagnation. If the body feels slightly unwell, performing these movements will resolve it. Old *daoyin* methods are too cumbersome for those of high rank to practice. This method requires no fixed time or count; one may perform it when at leisure, and its effects are swift.

When lying down at night, one should rub the limbs, chest, and abdomen with the hands ten times or so—this is called "dry bathing." Sleeping on the side with bent knees strengthens *qi* and vigor. One should spit out turbid saliva but swallow clear fluids. Often pressing the tongue against the upper palate, gathering the clear fluids and swallowing them, moistens the five viscera, gladdens the skin, and grants long life without aging. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "The mouth is the Jade Pool, the palace of great harmony; rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid keeps calamity at bay." It also says: "Close the mouth, curl the tongue to drink the embryonic fluid, and I shall refine and attain transcendence." Frequently clicking the teeth strengthens them and wards off evil.

In spring and summer, one should sleep late and rise early; in autumn, sleep early and rise early; in winter, sleep early and rise late. One should not rise before the cock crows nor sleep after sunrise. In heat, one should remain relaxed; in cold, one should stay warm and enclosed. This accords with the four seasons and is the way to preserve the body and prolong life.

**On Clothing**
I have heard that the thickness of clothing should suit the season and be moderate. Thus, in summer, one should not wear only thin garments, nor in winter should one dress excessively warm. In intense heat, wearing a single layer, with a light robe and light curtains, or covering the waist, abdomen, and knees with a quilt, is most beneficial. In winter, cotton clothing should not be too thick; when cold, one may add layers gradually. This prevents sudden exposure to cold or heat. Thus, in cold weather, warmth is preserved, and one is not harmed by excess heat; in hot weather, coolness is added, and one is not harmed by cold. If one recklessly removes or adds clothing with the changing temperatures, one will be harmed by cold or heat. In cold, one should dress gradually; in heat, one should remove layers gradually. The area from the waist down to the feet should remain warm, while the chest up to the head should be slightly cool—but not so cool as to chill, nor so warm as to dry. If clothing becomes damp with sweat, change it at once. Do not wear clothes that have just been heated by fire before the heat has dissipated. When cold and heat are balanced and the body and spirit are tranquil, illness does not arise, and life is naturally prolonged.

**On Diet**
Food and drink nourish the blood and *qi* of the person. Blood nourishes and beautifies the body, while *qi* guards and protects the limbs. The essence becomes marrow and essence; the lesser part becomes flesh and muscle. One should not wait until extreme hunger to eat nor until extreme fullness to stop. One should always eat to a state between hunger and satiety.

The Daoist of the Green Ox said: "One should eat only when hungry and drink only when thirsty, never forcing food or drink." One should not eat hot food first and then cold, lest the clash of cold and heat cause harm. All food should first be hot, then warm, and only then may one consume a little cold food. Food that is too hot harms the bones; food that is too cold harms the sinews. Though hot, it should not scald the lips; though cold, it should not freeze the teeth. In eating, warm is better than cold, little is better than much, cooked is better than raw, and bland is better than salty.

After eating hot food, do not wash the face, lest one lose their complexion and feel as if insects crawl upon it. Washing the hair after a full meal causes head wind. One should not indulge excessively in favored foods, lest it cause harm and illness. Nor should one entirely abandon disliked flavors, lest the viscera and *qi* become unbalanced. For example, avoiding all bitter flavors weakens the heart *qi*, and avoiding all salty flavors weakens the kidney *qi*.

Thus, heaven has the five phases, humans have the five viscera, and food has the five flavors. The liver corresponds to wood, the heart to fire, the spleen to earth, the lungs to metal, and the kidneys to water. Sour enters the liver, bitter enters the heart, sweet enters the spleen, acrid enters the lungs, and salty enters the kidneys. Wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, and water generates wood. Wood restrains earth, earth restrains water, water restrains fire, fire restrains metal, and metal restrains wood. Therefore, in each season, one should not overconsume the flavor that dominates or the one that restrains it, as both harm the dominant viscus. One should eat the flavors that generate the dominant phase to assist its *qi*. When the dominant viscus is unharmed and its *qi* is augmented, when diet is moderate and cold and heat are balanced, no illnesses arise, and long life is naturally prolonged.

**On Residence and Dwelling**

The *Tradition* states: "Where the earth is thick and the water deep, dwelling there brings no illness." Thus, in choosing a place to live, one should seek locations where the earth is thick and the water deep, regardless of direction. The soil should be firm, moist, and yellow; the water should be sweet, pure, and clear. The dwelling one habitually occupies must be tightly sealed, with no crevices allowing wind to enter, for prolonged exposure harms the body.

Wind is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth—it can nurture all things yet also injure man. When it first enters the interstices of the skin, it gradually penetrates the flesh, then transmits inward through the channels and collaterals, reaching the viscera and bowels. As its transmission spreads, its harm deepens. Thus, the ancients said: "Avoid wind as one avoids an arrow."

In sweltering heat, sitting in a room open at both ends readily invites wind, especially in narrow passageways. One must not sleep exposed during intense heat. From the Beginning of Spring to the Beginning of Autumn, one should sleep with the head facing east; from the Beginning of Autumn to the Beginning of Spring, with the head facing west.

A medicinal pillow is superior to one of precious jade, for jade, being excessively cold, harms the brain. If the medicinal properties are too heating, the hot *qi* will rush upward; if too cold, the cold *qi* will injure the brain. Only those that regulate wind and balance cold are appropriate.

**Recipe for the Medicinal Pillow**
Used over time, it treats head wind, dizziness, heaviness of the brain, cold-induced pain, dim vision, nasal congestion, and also wards off evil.

- *Manjingzi* (Vitex fruit) – 8 fen
- *Ganjuhua* (chrysanthemum) – 8 fen
- *Xixin* (asarum) – 6 fen
- *Haobaizhi* (angelica) – 6 fen
- *Baimu* (stemona) – 4 fen
- *Shaoyao* (peony) – 6 fen
- *Tongcao* (tetrapanax) – 8 fen
- *Fangfeng* (saposhnikovia) – 8 fen
- *Gaoben* (ligusticum) – 6 fen
- *Lingyangjiao* (antelope horn) – 8 fen
- *Xijiao* (rhinoceros horn) – 8 fen
- *Shishangwangpu* (acorus) – 8 fen
- Black soybeans – 5 *ge* (selected, rinsed in cold water)

Grind the above ingredients finely, sift to remove coarse particles, and mix evenly. Place them in a raw silk pouch. To enhance their efficacy, enclose this pouch in a second bag of green silk, sewing it into a pillow shape. Pack the herbs tightly, then place the pillow in a box of the same shape, allowing the herb-filled pouch to protrude about one and a half *cun* above the box’s rim. When using the pillow, remove the box’s lid; when not in use, replace it to prevent the medicinal *qi* from dissipating. Over time, the herbs will shrink; replenish them or add black soybeans to restore fullness. After three to five months, when the medicinal *qi* wanes, replace the herbs. Within ten days to a month of first use, a slight ringing in the ears may occur—this is the sign of the herbs drawing out wind.

**On Medicinal Foods**

**Discerning the Use of Minerals and Metals**
Minerals and metals possess principles of both benefit and harm. To master the art of nourishing life, one must thoroughly understand the nature of medicinal stones.

Let us pose hypothetical questions to clarify these truths.

**Question:** Minerals and metals do not decay when buried or soften when boiled; they can consolidate *qi* and prolong life. Herbs and plants, however, are prone to decay—how can they have the power to preserve vitality?

**Answer:** Minerals and metals are inherently harsh and dry, lacking moisture. For those in their prime, consuming them brings no benefit; for the weak and infirm, their toxicity emerges. In youth, *qi* is abundant and smooth—abundance can restrain the stone, and smoothness can circulate it, so no harm arises. In old age, the *qi* of the constructive and defensive systems becomes sluggish; sluggishness prevents the stone from circulating, and weakness prevents it from being restrained. Unrestrained, the stone lingers and accumulates, becoming a grave danger. Seeking benefit, one incurs harm—where is the preservation of vitality?

**Question:** Are there cases where the stone’s toxicity manifests even before debility sets in?

**Answer:** When sorrow and worry lodge in the heart and cannot be dispelled, the constructive and defensive *qi* stagnate and fail to circulate. The stone’s potency congeals and does not disperse, giving rise to accumulations and sores. Some who consume minerals rely on their potency to indulge in excess, and as the stone’s force moves, it produces the condition of "unyielding strength." The uninformed regard this as a miraculous effect, but when the essence and fluids wither and scorch, intense heat arises—like adding firewood to a boiling cauldron, few escape unscathed.

**Question:** If minerals and metals are so harmful, why did the Divine Farmer include them in the *Materia Medica*?

**Answer:** For those with extreme cold and deficiency, temporary use is permissible—once the illness is cured, one should stop, and no harm will follow.

**Further Question:** Earlier, it was said that the stone’s potency is harsh, and its toxicity emerges when the viscera weaken. Yet those who are already deficient and take minerals do not seem to suffer harm—why is this?

**Answer:** Initially, the stone’s potency remains dormant, and the body’s extreme cold and deficiency prevent its activation. Thus, during times of profound cold and deficiency, temporary use is acceptable. However, for long-term prevention of illness, herbs and plants are superior.

**Question:** If herbs and plants themselves do not endure, how can they preserve human life?

**Answer:** Consistent use allows their potency to accumulate, and after years of ingestion, great benefits are attained. Remedies for attacking illnesses show their efficacy when the disease is cured; formulas for preserving vitality prove their worth when the body feels at ease. When form and spirit are tranquil, longevity naturally endures.

**Fruit-Based Foods**

**Lotus Seed Powder**
Governs: supplementing the center, nourishing the spirit, augmenting *qi* and strength, and eliminating all illnesses. Prolonged use lightens the body and extends years.

Select lotus seeds in the eighth month when their skins have blackened. Remove the skins and hearts, dry in the sun, grind, and sift into powder. Take in the morning, mixed with wine or white congee. Do not consume with rehmannia.

When lotus seeds are tender, eating them raw may disturb *qi*; as powder, they benefit the body.

**Chestnut Powder**
Governs: thickening the intestines and stomach, supplementing kidney *qi*.

Dry chestnuts in the sun until their skins split naturally. Remove the skins, slice thinly, and dry thoroughly. Grind into powder and consume as with lotus powder.

Eating chestnuts raw may breed worms and disturb *qi*; cooked, they may cause bloating. It is best to dry them until half-dry, warm them near the body, and then consume—they are most beneficial.

**Grape Syrup**
Though a common preparation, it excels in tonic benefits. It governs damp impediment in sinews and bones, augments *qi* and strength, and nourishes the flesh. Long-term consumption lightens the body, prevents aging, and extends years.

When grapes ripen, first pour a *dou* each of sheep broth and rice-washing water at the base of the vine. After one night, select the ripest grapes, place them in a new white jar, filling it snugly. Seal tightly for one hundred days, and the syrup will form naturally. Strain and drink—the flavor surpasses rich wine, greatly benefiting the body.

**Pomegranate-Pear Syrup**
Treats wind-heat, dizziness, oppression, and vexing agitation.
Take twenty large green pears, ten pomegranates, and three *sheng* of light bamboo sap.
Pound the pomegranates and pears, squeeze out their natural juice, strain, and mix with the bamboo sap. Take five *ge* per dose, three times daily. If the pears are very large, use twenty; if small, thirty.

**Grains and Vegetables**
**Sesame**
Governs vacuity and emaciation in the intestines, supplements the five viscera, augments *qi* and strength, promotes muscle growth, sharpens vision, fills the marrow and brain, strengthens sinews and bones, and dispels vacuous heat. Also called *jusheng*.

The *Four-Ridged* text calls it "sesame," while the *Eight Grains* names it *jusheng*. Tao Hongjing states: "Among the eight grains, only this is finest." Elsewhere, he notes its sweetness and classifies it with rice and beans—this refers specifically to black sesame.

The *jusheng* in use today has stems and pods resembling hemp, but its leaves are much larger, its taste bitter, and its nature extremely cold. A bitter taste precludes its inclusion among grains, and its cold nature renders it unsuitable for supplementation. Its leaves differ from hemp’s, drooping in shade and rising in sunlight—this must be a distinct plant, not *jusheng* or sesame. Yet common practice persists without recognizing the error.

The proper variety is black oil-sesame, which is sweet. Pods with four ridges are sesame; those with eight ridges are *jusheng*, precisely matching the *Divine Farmer’s Classic*. The bitter, cold variety should not be used.

**Meats**
**Duanli Sheep**
When men consume it, it depletes *yang*; when women consume it, it severs *yin*. This refers to horned northern sheep.

**Sheep Marrow**
Supplements vacuity and detriment.

**Sheep Brain**
Consumption does not benefit the body.

**Venison**
Warm. Supplements the center, fortifies the five viscera, and augments *qi* and strength.

Master Huju states: "Deer are alert and fierce, feeding on fine grasses and dwelling only on hills or near moist valleys. Their suitability for divine offerings stems from their purity." They consume nine beneficial grasses: deer’s-tongue, deer’s-medicine, white mugwort, water dropwort, licorice, *shancang*, kudzu leaves and roots, *qitouhao*, and shepherd’s purse. These grasses resolve toxins, treat wind, and counteract mineral drugs. Eating venison while taking *aconite* reduces the latter’s efficacy. Avoid consumption in the fifth month, and keep velvet away from the nose.

**River Deer**
Warm. Supplements the five viscera. From the eighth to the eleventh month, it surpasses mutton in quality. After the twelfth month, it provokes wind, darkens the complexion, and becomes inedible.

**Eel**
Warm. Governs the five types of hemorrhoids, kills parasites, and supplements *yang* *qi*. Consuming it three to five times cures all ailments between the waist and kidneys. The five-colored variety also regulates the hundred diseases of the *dai* meridian in women. Mince the flesh, remove the bones, season with the five flavors, stuff into sheep intestines, tie the ends, and roast until cool. Then slice and eat.

**Parrotfish**
The yellow female is warm. Governs vacuous thirst, frequent urination, and diarrhea; supplements the five viscera, augments *qi* and strength. The black variety treats wind.

**Soft-Shelled Turtle**
Neutral, supplementing. Dispels heat and blackness lodged in the joints. Avoid consumption in the fifth and sixth months. One person ground turtle shell into powder and, after contracting yin-dampness during these months, suddenly transformed into small turtles.

**Cuttlefish**
Neutral, supplementing. Not to be eaten with mushrooms. Best prepared in ghee.

Note: The *du* fish has no sinews; the parrotfish has no marrow—both are often discarded in medicinal and culinary use.

**Magpie**
Neutral, supplementing.
