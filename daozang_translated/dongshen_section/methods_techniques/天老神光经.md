**Memorial on the Celestial Elder’s Divine Radiance Scripture**

Your subject has heard that when man cannot perceive form, he relies on water as a mirror. When affairs cannot be foreseen, their omens are made clear. Though divination by milfoil and fire is insubstantial, it still requires concentrated intent. Though a water mirror is limpid, it depends on the eye to take form. Thus, form is discerned through the eye to perceive the subtle, and omens are observed through understanding to behold the wondrous. When such matters are fully grasped, what can be imitated? If even one aspect is lacking, it becomes difficult to rely upon.

Your subject’s nature is dull, his skills meager, and his arts shallow. Yet, having cursorily perused extraordinary texts, he has gleaned their essentials. For instance, in matters before one’s eyes—determining distance, discerning right and wrong, distinguishing blue from yellow, knowing good from evil, observing the celestial patterns above, measuring human sentiments in the middle, and examining the earthly configurations below—all these depend on the radiance within the eye. If one can perceive it, when marching to battle, departing with troops, or traversing land and water, the *qi* beneath the eyes turns dark. If the radiance departs from the eyes, calamity arrives at once. Then, above, one cannot see the auxiliary stars; in the middle, one cannot distinguish kin from stranger; below, one cannot observe the myriad things. This is the departure of divine radiance, and one will fail to perceive these wonders. In the face of disaster, how could one not err?

There is a saying: amid darkness and obscurity, if one can preserve the divine radiance in the corners of the eyes and observe the auxiliary stars at *Wuqu*, then there is no need for divination by milfoil or fire. Fortune and misfortune are foreknown; before weapons clash, victory or defeat is already clear. Its text is concise and easy to teach; its principles are refined and easy to comprehend. Thus, one may avoid peril and attain safety, transform misfortune into blessing.

It is known that when Emperor Gaozu’s heart stirred, he swiftly evaded the pursuer’s plot. When Zhao Xiang’s horse startled, he instantly recognized the assassin’s guise. Since ancient times, the wise and sagacious have all revered Master Kuang. Jin Ping and Zhang Liang received the essentials of the Yellow Stone. This transmission has circulated through the ages, its history long and deep. Yet, the text may contain errors, and its language may be prolix.

Your humble servant, in his presumption, has arranged and compiled this into a single scroll, entitled *The Celestial Elder’s Divine Radiance*, which he respectfully presents to the imperial court. Your servant is well aware that Your Majesty’s sagely mind is luminous and penetrating, mastering the subtlest principles. Yet, I now dare to submit this, though it may burden Your Majesty’s ears with its prolixity. I fear Your Majesty may deem these trifling matters unworthy of acceptance. Yet, if Your Majesty’s august heart might indulge this humble servant’s foolish candor, I truly believe it offers protection. In times of peril and hardship, none should be without this Way. It ensures self-preservation and, when facing matters, reveals fortune or misfortune in advance. Thus, I have examined it in detail, not disdaining the humble offering of a rustic. With unwavering loyalty and devotion, I risk death to present this memorial, humbly submitting it for Your Majesty’s consideration.

Your servant is filled with awe and trepidation, guilty of transgression, guilty of transgression. Respectfully submitted.

On a day in the seventh year of the Zhenguan era, your servant Li Jing, Right Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat and Duke of Weiguo, presents this memorial.

*The Scripture of the Celestial Elder’s Divine Radiance*
Compiled by Li Jing, Right Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat and Duke of Weiguo

Duke Jinping asked Master Kuang: "When a man sets out on a journey or leads troops into battle, are victory or defeat, life or death, truly foreknowable?"
Master Kuang replied: "One must observe the auxiliary stars beside the Northern Dipper. If, when preparing for battle, these stars are not visible at dusk, the expedition must not proceed—it is greatly inauspicious. If they are absent due to illness, the appointed time of death draws near."

Duke Jinping asked: "When the sky is overcast and the stars are unseen, how can one discern fortune or misfortune?"
Master Kuang replied: "If the stars are not visible, one must observe the divine radiance. Without this radiance, no reckless action should be taken."

Duke Jinping asked: "What is this divine radiance?"
Master Kuang replied: "It constantly resides within the eye. In dark places, press a finger into the corner of the eye and shake the head—if the auxiliary stars appear, they may be seen. If, when many look together, one alone cannot see them, the auxiliary star has departed, and great misfortune is certain. If a person’s illness prevents them from seeing it, death will come within seven days. This Way is subtle and profound, a vision of unique clarity."

Duke Jinping said: "Excellent!"

Having inscribed these words upon jade tablets and sealed them in a case, he would often unroll and peruse them.

The Yellow Emperor said: "When the heart stirs and the eyes flicker, one may foreknow the fortune or misfortune of life and fate. The brightness of Heaven is discerned through the sun, moon, and Dipper. The brightness of man is discerned through the eyes, with the heart as its master. If one can comprehend this, one may preserve the body and safeguard life. The spirit of the nose and eyes converges in the heart, and thus one must first observe and examine it. When the heart stirs, the eyes flicker, and the nose grows sour—if the divine radiance departs, great misfortune follows.

Should one wish to detect thieves or traitors, one must attend to the divine radiance. If the radiance is greenish-white, the person is a traitor. If it is black, the person is a thief.

In all travels, when the heart stirs, the eyes flicker, and the nose grows sour, one must immediately attend to the divine radiance. If the radiance departs, there is a thief ahead. With each flicker of the eye, a *li* ahead there is surely a thief—one must prepare accordingly.

When journeying to another town and wishing to lodge, first attend to the divine radiance. If there is no radiance, do not enter the dwelling, for there will surely be sorrow.

Master Kuang said: "If the radiance is yellow or red and round, there is virtue and joy. If it is white, there are hidden soldiers and mourning among the people. If it is green and incomplete, there is sorrow. If it is a single *li* in size, there are thieves, illness, or soldiers.

If, while dwelling there, one sits or lies uneasy, attend to the divine radiance at once. If it does not appear, depart swiftly.

When sleeping at night and wishing to know good or ill fortune, one may attend to the divine radiance.

For those about to wage war, first observe the celestial signs above, then distinguish the divine radiance within. If one wishes to cross water, one should attend to it—if it does not appear, one must not cross. If one sets out on a journey and it does not appear, one must not proceed. If it does not appear when approaching food, one must not eat.

When about to eat or drink, if the heart stirs, the nose grows sour, the eyes flicker, and the radiance departs—one’s companions intend harm; beware. If the tongue stirs, the lips flicker, and the radiance departs, a son intends to kill his father, or a servant to kill his master. If the heart stirs, the navel flickers, and the radiance departs, a son intends to harm his father. If the heart stirs, the radiance departs, and the elbow flickers, a concubine is the thief. If the heart stirs, the palm flickers, and the radiance departs, the thief is a relative. If the heart stirs with alarm and the radiance departs, a younger brother intends to harm his elder. If the heart stirs and the right foot flickers, the journey will be profitable. If the left foot flickers, there is trouble in the public sphere. If the heart stirs, the cheek flickers, and the radiance departs, the thief is a friend. If the heart stirs, the eyes flicker, and the radiance departs, a wife or concubine is having an affair and intends harm. If the heart stirs and the radiance departs, leave the dwelling at once.

Again, attend to the divine radiance: if the left eye has radiance, the left path is open. If the right eye has radiance, the right path is open. If both eyes have radiance, one may proceed. If the heart stirs with disquiet, avoid conflict above and below, for there will be strife.

If the eyes have no radiance and the ears ring without cause, one sitting must rise swiftly, one walking must flee—someone intends harm. This is the spirit and soul concealed in the ears.

If the left eye flickers, it concerns one’s own affairs. If the right eye flickers, it concerns another’s affairs. If the nose grows sour and the ears ring, strange sorrows will soon arrive.

For the noble scholar, five days before death, the radiance departs, and the *po* soul also departs. For ordinary people, the *hun* soul is stored in the nose, the *po* soul in the mouth, and thus they unite with the body. The divine radiance emerges from the eyes, and essence and *qi* unite with the spirit. Wherever it departs, one must carefully divine its meaning.

In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor was about to pass, his radiance departed ten days prior. For the Zhou and Confucius, it was five days. For recent martyrs, it was but three. The radiance is stored in the eyes, the voice in the ears, and the essence in the yin. When the appointed time draws near, how can one not be present?"

If the ears hear no sound, the eyes emit no radiance, and the yin does not stir, the malevolent master approaches—follow the light to evade it, and great fortune shall be yours.

Qibo said: In a dimly lit place, cover your eyes with your hands and visualize the divine radiance. If it appears green, there is cause for concern; white, it portends warfare; red, virtue; yellow, joy; and if it bears a dark hue, misfortune follows.

Liu Gen said: A white radiance may also signify virtue.

On *jia-yi* days, the eyes govern; on *bing-ding* days, the heart; on *wu-ji* days, the abdomen; on *geng-xin* days, the back; and on *ren-gui* days, the heels. On these days, if the heart stirs, the eyes flicker, or the radiance manifests, take heed. If none appear, an assailant may be plotting against you—prepare your defenses.

On *jia-yi* days, if the heart stirs, the assailant will be small and slender, with a sallow complexion and a fondness for speech. On *bing-ding* days, if the heart stirs, the assailant will be robust, ruddy-faced, with disheveled hair and broad cheeks. On *wu-ji* days, if the heart stirs, the assailant will be plump like a rat, with a large belly, silent, and yellow-haired. On *geng-xin* days, if the heart stirs, the assailant will have broad brows and a large nose, and be garrulous. On *ren-gui* days, if the heart stirs, the assailant will be tall with a small head, of a dark hue, and fond of hunting and fishing. If you prepare accordingly, all affairs will succeed, you will evade warfare and harm, and Heaven itself will grant you favor.

Store the radiance between the brows once every five days to prolong life. If you hear a solitary voice, it will cause ringing in the ears. When the spirit and essence are unsettled, the infant soul is greatly startled, sorrow and melancholy arise, and the desire to return to Heaven grows. Strike your ears with your hands, and the infant soul will return. When the ears ring, immediately visualize the divine radiance.

The Yellow Emperor’s essential secret ensures the preservation of life and body. Whenever one hears ringing in the ears—whether cries, wails, shouts, thunder, or drumming—or detects a foul, fishy odor in the nose, all portend misfortune. One should purify oneself with fasting and bathing, then at dusk face the natal star and perform the *Yu Step* three times, calling out: *"Jumen Shenzi, Qingmen Shenzi, Lucunzi, Hucuozi, Hengbuyunzi, Bazhizi, Daguizi."* By reciting this method, no calamity shall befall you. If danger arises, call upon the name of your governing star, saying, *"Come to my aid,"* three times and stop.

The first, at *wu*, belongs to *Pojun*; the second, at *si* and *wei*, to *Wuqu*; the third, at *shen* and *chen*, to *Lianzhen*; the fourth, at *mao* and *you*, to *Wenqu*; the fifth, at *yin* and *xu*, to *Lucun*; the sixth, at *chou* and *hai*, to *Jumen*; and the seventh, at *zi*, to *Tanlang.*

**The Yu Step Method**
Laozi said: Wherever one resides, one should visualize the radiance and observe the *Fuxing* star—the small star beside *Wuqu*. Seeing it brings good fortune; failing to see it brings misfortune, though one may still secure a hundred days of safety. If seen, there will be no official disasters, slander, illness, or death within a hundred days—hence it is called *preserving a hundred days*. If the sky is overcast and the *Fuxing* star is not visible, visualize the radiance in darkness. If still unseen, carefully search the four directions for it. By regularly visualizing it at dawn and night, one attains longevity.

**The Heavenly Deity’s Covering Dipper Spirit Incantation** safeguards the body and protects life, granting a century of honor and longevity. Do not transmit it to the unworthy.

The incantation reads:
*"Round and round, I report to the four directions, Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon. On this path I traverse, swiftly seize the Ghost King. Bind and restrain every person, capture the fierce and perverse. Before I awaken, they shall not disperse. With a myriad of qilin troops, scatter them to the five directions. I respectfully invoke the twenty-eight stellar officials and the thirty-five star chiefs—descend swiftly and stand beside your servant for years. Reverse the talismans of rebellious ghosts, intercept and suppress all omens. The stellar officials, covering the Dipper, bind the traitors in reverse. Speak swiftly, swiftly, swiftly, swiftly—then cover the Dipper. One step, one star: *Qianyuan, Hengli, Zhen.* □□□□□□□. Proclaim to the Mysterious Diagram."*

Great is the Dao of Heaven, its patterns manifest yet beyond the grasp of mere wisdom. Since ancient times, those who understood it flourished in the Way, while those who did not perished—how much more so for ordinary mortals. Yet I, undeterred by my limited strength, have measured my virtue and inscribed it upon my heart, forsaking form to delve into the profound and subtle. I have compiled these into diagrams and records, as if arrayed upon my palm. Follow this path, and utmost sincerity will surely evoke response.

Positions and seating are meticulously arranged, each detail duly recorded. Future noble ones, treasure and safeguard this, passing it to later generations, but never reveal it to the foolish or unworthy. What is attained here does not come from external seeking, nor does cultivation depend on others. As the *Yin Fu Jing* states: *"The cosmos lies within the hand; the myriad transformations arise from the body."*

In all, there are eighty-three thousand one hundred stars by day and three thousand one hundred stars by night, with eighty thousand stars visible in the night sky. Among the four Dipper stellar officials, three are on duty each night beneath the Northern Dipper.

For those unfamiliar with the rites, a ready-made petition text is provided below as a model.

Invocation to the Ten Directions and all enlightened, responsive deities:

On the [day] of [month] in the year [year], your disciple [name], of [prefecture, county, village], respectfully presents this offering of paper money to the [Star Official’s name] at [location], beseeching [specific blessing].

Now, as incense is kindled, I humbly invoke the divine presence to descend. May my petition ascend before the [Star Official’s name]. Taking up the blade, I declare the purification:

I reverently summon the true qi of the Azure Dragon of the East into my water.
I reverently summon the true qi of the Vermilion Dragon of the South into my water.
I reverently summon the true qi of the White Dragon of the West into my water.
I reverently summon the true qi of the Black Dragon of the North into my water.
I reverently summon the true qi of the Yellow Dragon of the Center into my water.

I reverently summon the nine Wood Officials of the East to dispel impurity.
I reverently summon the three Fire Officials of the South to dispel impurity.
I reverently summon the seven Metal Officials of the West to dispel impurity.
I reverently summon the five Water Officials of the North to dispel impurity.
I reverently summon the twelve Earth Officials of the Center to dispel impurity.
I reverently summon the twelve Heavenly and twelve Earthly Officials to dispel impurity.

I reverently summon the Jade Lads of Purification, the Jade Maidens of Cleansing, and the Fragrant Water Messengers to dispel all impurities—those of heaven, earth, humanity, ghosts, sunken corpses, and bleached bones. Whatever the eye sees or the ear hears, let great impurities return to the sea and minor impurities to the rivers, without delay. Delay shall bring death to those who resist my divine qi; defiance shall bring destruction. Any impurity that remains shall be severed and delivered to the Kui and Wang spirits.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!

Knead the incense three times.

Upon completing the incense offering, declare:
First incense offering to the Southern Dipper Star Official.
Second incense offering to the Northern Dipper Star Official.
Third incense offering to all enlightened beings of the Ten Directions.

I humbly invoke the [Star Official’s name] to descend in compassion, receive these humble offerings, and accept this incense and wine. Bow twice.

I have heard that in the profound mysteries of the unseen, petitions must evoke a response. With this written petition, I now submit my plea. Read the petition aloud three times, then burn the paper money and scatter the fruits. Bow twice and pray:

May all attending officials partake in this grace and share in this joy.

Though I am lowly and my offerings meager, I am honored by your descent. Overwhelmed with reverence and awe, I beseech you to accept my plea and record my sincerity.

In my ignorance, I am unversed in proper rites. My words may be disorderly, offending your divine majesty. I beg your forgiveness and grant my wishes as requested. Bow twice and bid farewell.

Prayer to the deities:

First incense offering to the Southern Dipper Star Official.
Second incense offering to the Northern Dipper Star Official.
Third incense offering to all enlightened beings.

Jade radiance scatters light; golden censers rise with smoke.
Fragrant clouds weave densely, ascending to the Nine Heavens.
The Jade Maiden of Incense attends, bearing word to the Celestial Emperor.
Grant me long life, that I may forever be a true immortal.
All petitions and pleas, I beseech you to fulfill as spoken.

Alternatively:

Though I dwell in humble obscurity, I seek the Dao and yearn for the divine.
Ever beholding your august presence, I pray for eternal life.
One hundred and twenty years, free from all disasters and pestilence.
From failure, grant success; from peril, safety; from death, life.
May my dwelling be auspicious, my family peaceful.
On the day my wishes are fulfilled, I shall prostrate in boundless devotion and joy.

Next, read the petition three times.
Recite the Northern Dipper Mantra seven times.

I humbly invoke the [Star Official’s name] to descend in compassion and receive these humble offerings.

I have heard that in the profound mysteries of the unseen, petitions must evoke a response. With this written petition, I now submit my plea. Burn the paper money and petition, pour the wine, and scatter the fruits.

May all attending officials partake in this grace and share in this joy.

Though I am lowly and my offerings meager, I dare to present them. Honored by your descent, I am filled with awe. I beseech you to accept my plea and record my sincerity.

In my ignorance, I am unversed in proper rites. My words may be disorderly, offending your divine majesty. I beg your forgiveness and grant my wishes as requested. Bow twice and bid farewell.

Position the altar with the *jian* day at the back and the *po* day at the front, facing the Dipper.

In a major-month, place the thumb upon the front of the waist, then advance the left foot first, stepping to activate the mound’s power. In a minor-month, place the little finger upon the front of the waist, then advance the right foot first, stepping to activate the mound’s power. In a major-month, the Yu Step begins with the left—*Tianlao Shen Guang Jing* concludes.
