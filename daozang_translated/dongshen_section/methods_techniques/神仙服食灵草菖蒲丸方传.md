The herb *changpu* (acorus) is the essence of water, the sacred herb of divine immortals, and a treasured formula of the great sages. Recluses wandering the mountains and those who withdraw from the world in seclusion all consume it.

Emperor Wu of Liang, devoted to the classics and aspiring to immortality, sought wise scholars and virtuous men. During the Jinglong era, Lü Louyun submitted a memorial stating: "In the past, Dongfang Shuo, the immortal of Emperor Wu of Han’s court, revered and consumed *changpu*. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to follow his example."

The Liang sovereign emulated this practice, and after taking it, all illnesses vanished, his mind sharpened, and his spirit grew clear. The emperor sighed: "The numinous of heaven and the essence of earth take the divine as their master. Immortals revere the Dao as supreme, receiving the pure harmony of *qi*, with herbs as their foundation. *Chang* means ‘flourishing,’ *pu* means ‘universal,’ and *jing* means ‘numinous.’ This herb broadly cures all ailments, extends years, strengthens the will, and preserves youthful complexion—is it not truly the herb of immortals? How wondrous is *changpu*! I have secretly followed this method, consuming it morning and night according to the formula, and found it profoundly effective. Not only do men and women, young and old, benefit from it, but its advantages are even greater. Those who take it are protected by spirits and gods, though the world cannot fathom its reason. There are no taboos against its use. If one experiences heat in the body, boil one *qian* of *qinjiao* (gentian) in a cup of water, let it cool, and drink it to settle the condition, for it serves as an assistant to *changpu*."

Recorded in the fourteenth year of the Dali reign.

Yuanming notes: On the ninth day of the ninth month, gather *changpu*, dry it in the sun, pound it into powder, mix it with glutinous rice paste, and form it into pills.

Another method, from the *Taiqing Scripture*: The divine immortals’ sacred herb *changpu* should be gathered on the third day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, or the tenth day of the tenth month. When collecting it, choose only those growing in clear, still waters upon rocks, preferably in south-flowing streams—those from north-flowing waters are unsuitable. Alternatively, select plants growing in pure soil, harvest them on the same day, remove the root hairs on the spot, clean them thoroughly, place them in a vessel, and rinse them in water to remove impurities. Cut the firm parts into thin slices, dry them in good sunlight, pound them through a sieve, and on a propitious day, prepare a paste. Use aged glutinous rice, soak it overnight, rinse it to remove impurities, grind it finely in a stone mortar, strain the dregs, and cook it until thick. Mix the powdered *changpu* into the paste until fully incorporated, then have several people roll it into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Dry them in the sun, store them in a container, and begin by taking ten pills. Chew a mouthful of rice, swallow the pills with it, then wash them down with wine. Eating a light meal afterward is especially beneficial. There are no taboos against its use.

After taking it for ten months, it aids digestion. After two months, it dispels cold ailments. After three months, all illnesses are cured. By the fourth year, one’s spirit becomes abundant. By the fifth year, the marrow is fully replenished. By the sixth year, the complexion glows like a child’s. By the seventh year, white hair turns black again. By the eighth year, fallen teeth regrow. By the ninth year, the skin becomes smooth and supple. By the tenth year, the face blooms like a peach blossom. By the eleventh year, the bones grow light. By the twelfth year, one becomes a true immortal, attaining eternal life and transcending the world, with a visage like the hibiscus, commanding the myriad spirits, untouched by malevolent forces, and forever free from misfortune. This elixir allows great immortals to ascend; yet the world remains unaware. I chanced upon these effects recorded in the *Shangqing Sutra*. This must not be recklessly transmitted to the unworthy, lest they treat it with negligence. Those who obtain it will calm the mind, replenish qi, strengthen resolve, invigorate the spirit, fill the marrow, restore essence, and turn even the beard black. If one takes it with devotion, eternal life is assured. Another method states that even at three hundred and thirty years, its benefits persist, granting transcendence and immortality—such is the unmatched power of *changpu*. Yet if one lacks resolve, the fault lies not in the remedy itself.

It may be gathered on any of the five days, the outer skin scraped away, thinly sliced, and dried in the sun. Proceed as before: pound it through a sieve, mix the powder with finely ground non-glutinous rice paste, and knead into a dough. Then place it in an iron mortar and pound three thousand times to form pills.

Liu Gen said: "Those who take *changpu* will read widely without fatigue, remain wakeful day and night, and have all spirits attend them." Bian Que said: "*Changpu* cures long-standing wind illnesses, widely benefiting the world. Men and women with ailments should all take it." Once, Tao Qian gathered it on the fifth day of the fifth month and made honeyed pills, which proved effective without taboos. If made into rice-based pills, the results are sublime. The old and young may take it without harm, and there are no restrictions.

Take twenty-five pills at dawn, twenty-five at noon, and thirty in the evening, without missing any dose. After a year, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms will be expelled, and no further disturbances will arise. In Henan County, a Daoist named Ye Jingyuan’s mother, aged thirty-five, fell ill with wind-stroke, her limbs paralyzed, her body emaciated and feeble, her appearance ghostly. She sought every remedy in the medical texts, but none worked. Then a transcendent from Shaoshi Mountain instructed her to take this elixir. After a year, all her ailments vanished, her body became robust and radiant, her skin fair and rosy, her steps light and swift, her hearing and vision sharp.

After five years, one’s appearance grows ever more youthful, its efficacy beyond measure.

It further cures all wind-induced ailments of the waist and legs, hemiplegia, numbness and paralysis of the hands and feet, partial paralysis, the Five Labors and Seven Injuries, hemorrhoids and fistulas with unbearable pain that pierces the heart, sweat soaking through garments as in consumptive illness, dry eyes and aching feet, visceral disharmony with alternating diarrhea and dysentery—all such chronic, wasting afflictions vanish upon taking this elixir, their roots eradicated.

For epidemic heat diseases, miasmic vapors, seasonal pestilences, and consumptive contagions that claim nine out of ten lives, this remedy alone brings timely recovery.

It also treats women suffering from postpartum blood dizziness, rushing upward to the heart, or unremitting red-and-white vaginal discharge threatening life. Simply combine the *changpu* pills with a small amount of *danggui*, decoct in a bowl, and take hot—relief is immediate.

For men burdened by heavy legs, splitting headaches, leaden limbs, and enfeebled pulses, barely able to walk without stumbling or sit without support, this elixir swiftly restores health.

All ailments of men and women alike fall within its dominion.

The elixir possesses Five Virtues, corresponding to the Five Phases:
- The green *qi* enters the herb as the East,
- The white *qi* enters the stem as the West,
- The red *qi* enters the flower as the South,
- The yellow *qi* enters the heart as the Center,
- The black *qi* enters the root as the North.

It further strengthens bones and marrow, replenishes vital fluids, fills the blood and nourishes the brain, moistens the Five Viscera, benefits the Six Bowels, stimulates the appetite, relieves dryness of the skin, fortifies teeth and gums, stabilizes the hun and po souls, augments vitality, dispels chills and fevers, harmonizes the hundred pulses, and ensures the well-being of the four limbs.

For the superior practitioner, it guarantees eternal life.
For the middling practitioner, it extends years and preserves youth.
For the inferior practitioner, it wards off all illness.

It dissolves every malady. For those of pure intent who cultivate the Dao, its consumption grants divine powers as recorded.

Those who attained transcendence through *changpu* are named below:
- Master Kou, who achieved immortality by consuming *changpu*—to this day, *changpu* grows before his temple.

- Gai Chuo, after ten years;

The *Immortals’ Records* state: *The Twelve Scrolls of the Changpu Transmission* are kept in the highest sanctum. This is fully documented in the *Shangqing Scripture*; here, only the essentials are excerpted for those who seek the Dao.

Its efficacy is no deception. Those who single-mindedly gather the herb and consume it according to the method will surely prolong their years. Yet if petty men who scorn the Dao forcefully slander and fabricate falsehoods, they invite early demise.

Though this formula is authentic, it should be transmitted only to worthy gentlemen and Daoist practitioners. It must not be lightly disclosed—guard it well.

Here ends the transmission of the divine *changpu* nine-pill recipe.
