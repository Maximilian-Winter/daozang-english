**Method of the Thought-Seal Qi Formula**

To seal mountains and rivers, seas and lakes: first knock the teeth twelve times, then face the land to be sealed. With the left hand form the *Du Jian* mudra, hold the breath, and step the Nine Traces. For mountains and rivers, visualize an imperial procession, with celestial officials and soldiers arrayed in the colors of the directions, each bearing hooked spears, censers, and axes, spreading through the mountains and forests.

The flaming mountains open like a hunting dog’s eyes; the forests and trees part. Inhale qi through the mouth, press the tongue to the left, and gently swallow the qi. In the eyes, three newly forged forest spirits appear, clad in red garments with red hems, standing within the mouth. Raise the eyes and gaze intently three times, inhale qi three times with a sucking motion, swallow three times, and let the three spirits guide the qi as if drawing it into a net within the mouth. Press the tongue to the left, swallow, and send it into the abdomen.

For mountains, rivers, seas, and lakes, raise the eyes three times to survey, inhale qi five times, press the tongue three times and swallow once, then swallow fully when the qi is full. After nine presses, inhale qi through the mouth, face the seal, and invoke the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Swear an oath before the Three Officials, the Yellow Spirit, and the *Yuezhang*, observing the one hundred twenty-one prohibitions of the twelve hours.

Let the qi gather and condense; seal the mountain, and the mountain crumbles; seal the demon, and the demon vanishes; seal the ghost, and the ghost dies; seal the rebel, and the rebel perishes. Thus, thieves, bandits, blades, poisons, plagues, and all mountain brigands are shattered. Then, with the left hand, hold the seal and imprint it, holding the breath for twenty counts before releasing the seal. Exhale foul qi in all four directions, draw a well-character (井) on the ground with the left hand, and depart without looking back.

Visualize three figures in the liver, clad in green robes with red hems, bearing hooked spears, axes, and halberds. Visualize three in the heart, clad in red robes with red borders, bearing the same weapons. Visualize three in the lungs, clad in white robes with red borders. Visualize three in the spleen, clad in yellow robes with red fringes. Visualize three in the kidneys, clad in black robes with red hems, all bearing hooked spears, axes, and halberds.

Press the hand to the head, gaze with the eyes, and traverse the mountain three times. Follow the method’s qi count with the one hundred twenty chapters. For official seals, always imprint the seal before the well’s circle, attaching it to the households on either side. If slaves or servants flee, or horses are tethered, seal their tracks: if sealed in the direction of their flight, they will depart; if sealed against their path, they will return.

For thunder, lightning, and thunderbolts near a person’s dwelling, first inhale three times to draw the perverse qi of the thunderbolt into the seal, then seal the four corners of the house to suppress it. If an evil person seeks to harm another, seal their fate with the imprint. During an epidemic, place cinnabar into the seal’s teeth and imprint the household’s gates.

To seal a spirit shrine, enter the shrine, form the *Du Jian* mudra, hold the breath, and inhale the shrine’s spirits from all four directions. Exhale onto the seal’s teeth and imprint the Five *You* to dispatch ghosts. If felling mountains, stones, or large trees, create a cavity large enough to hold the seal, and bury it with turtle-shaped soil. If mixing with wine, place it in the cavity, hold the breath for twelve breaths, and imprint it with the *Yu* step.

Recite the incantation:
*"Great Supreme Lord Lao, with a thousand soldiers and ten thousand cavalry, capture the spirits of the world’s great trees, the numina of high mountains, the *yuan*, *tuo*, tortoises, and turtles, the *wangliang*, *ba*, and *mei*. The Five *You* of the world, foxes, and old otters—prostrate and die beneath the heavens’ crooked path. Sever heads and cut tongues; let them not move or act. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law and command!"*

For evil persons or treacherous officials who seek harm, upon seeing them, draw left qi twelve times, add right qi, and direct the seal toward them. Advance three steps, hold the breath three times, close the eyes, and exhale once. Then recite the heart incantation:
*"The Dao of Heaven connects me, the sun and moon benefit me, the stars and constellations protect me, the four seasons nourish me, the Five Phases complete me. Plots, curses, evil persons, and treacherous officials—prostrate corpses beneath the heavens’ display. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the *Yuezhang* law and command of the Northern Dipper!"*

**Sealing Gates to Sever Ghosts: Method and Text**

Carve a seal-sized cavity, fill it with red earth, and imprint it upon the household’s gates according to the *shang*, *jiao*, *zheng*, and *yu* tones. Perform the *Yu* step and place the character on the door. Facing outward, recite the incantation:
*"Village altar lords, the Two Mysteries of the Dao, the Three Origins and Four Beginnings, the officials of *jiazi*, the gate lords and door guardians, the *Ao* lords of the household, the village officers within the dwelling, the Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior, the Celestial One and Noble Person, the Six Harmonies and Queen of the Afterworld: The Daoist disciple so-and-so, with a household of such-and-such number, now resides in such-and-such village. Having covenanted with the Great Supreme and received the words of the Celestial Master, may this household, from year’s beginning to end, remain free of misfortune. May disasters and official calamities be suppressed, evil and rebellion extinguished, thieves and bandits eradicated, slander and strife unborn. May water and fire be subdued, the Five Weapons repelled, yin and yang harmonious and fortunate. May men and women be noble and prosperous, the household secure and untroubled, free from deep misfortune. May the soldiers of the Northern Dipper march with the sun and moon, the seal’s divine talisman guarded by vajra. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law and command!"*

**Method for Resolving Yin Calamities**

When the Celestial Stem aligns with misfortune, call upon the name of today’s deity three times, hold the breath to its utmost, press the seal toward the Heavenly Gate, cross the left foot over the right, and retreat two paces. Thrice invoke the Great Supreme Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, and the Jade Sovereign of the Three Qi. The Celestial Master and Libationer, having received the Heavenly Scriptures and examined the Heavenly Records, command the Four Seasons and Five Phases to sever the offspring of the Dao-less. May the thousand spirits and myriad demons submit and dare not rise. Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law and command!

**Method for Sealing Mountain and Marsh Talismans at Shrines**
Face the sovereign, loosen the hair, perform the Yu Step thrice, hold the breath for twenty-four counts, then gaze heavenward. Behold a figure thirty million *zhang* tall, clad in black robes with crimson hems, bearing the Three-and-Five Divine Talismans, descending to rest upon the seal—its form measuring two *cun* and one *fen*. Take earth and place it above, cross the left foot over the right, and tread nine times upon it. Next, direct the seal toward the ghost, then place earth upon the shrine. Proceed twenty paces forward, hold the breath thrice, and call: "Left Supreme, Right Mysterious Elder, the Most High claims your soul!" Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law and command!

If the shrine is distant, carry the seal within the breast three times, hold the breath, and recite the incantation over the seal:
*"The Three-and-Five march in ranks, the Northern Dipper crisscrosses. The Three Terraces and Five Ladles stand behind me now. May the thousand ghosts and myriad spirits flee in terror!"* Swiftly, swiftly, as in the law and command!

**For Epidemic Afflictions in Times of Heavenly Pestilence**
Expose the seal to the night dew and place it upon the altar for one night. At dawn, wash it with one *dou* (or five *sheng*) of fragrant water, then powder it with true cinnabar. Approaching the afflicted household, halt thirty to fifty paces away. Visualize fire blazing before you, and stride forward to burn the patient’s home until all is consumed in sight. Then summon kidney *qi* to manifest as water, extinguishing the fire. Advance to the patient, cradle their heart with the left hand, and recite: *"Noble one, true one—why did the Most High give you life?"* Cross the left foot over the right, draw left *qi* twelve times to the right, and press the seal upon the forehead’s *qi* to suppress malevolent apparitions. Place the seal within the breast, set white paper upon the altar, and place one *sheng* of clear water before it. Hold the breath thrice, pass the seal over the altar mud, turn leftward, hold the breath, and depart.

**For Distant or Urgent Cases Causing Unease in the Netherworld**
If swift travel is impossible, take one *dou* of well earth, place it in a vessel, and let it dry. At dawn, press the seal upon it, face east, hold the breath, clench the fists nine times, and return the earth to the well.

**For Restless Dead or Unsettled Tombs**
Apply true cinnabar to the seal’s teeth, press it upon a square foot of white silk, and seal it within the tomb passage. Place it at the head of the bed—no ghost will remain unsettled, all spirits will fear and rejoice, and severed ties will be restored.

**For Silkworm Failures, Women Unsuited to Sericulture, or Household Depletion**
Bury two iron figures within the altar, direct the seal toward the sovereign, then press it upon a square foot of earthenware, placing it before the garden three *chi* away, with the seal’s inscription facing the sovereign.

**For Fire Suppression in the Household**
Take a plank one *chi* and two *cun* long, seven *cun* wide, and inscribe in cinnabar: *"Primal Official, Examiner of the Living, Spirit of Heaven’s Emperor, Ghosts and Gods."* Hang it before the garden—auspicious.

**For Heavenly Disasters, Epidemic *Qi*, or Ghostly Slayings Resistant to All Arts**
Take twelve joints of green bamboo, place them in a well, and sever them into segments three *cun* and three *fen* long. After one night, retrieve them, combine with three *sheng* of white rice and three *sheng* of wine in a vessel, and let stand another night. Place the bamboo in the wine for one more night. At dawn, give one *ge* to each person to consume, commanding them to face the sovereign while ingesting.

**For Women Hindered by Water or Households with Excess Population**
On a Celestial Stem day, take one *sheng* of well-flower water, bow twice toward the sovereign, and press the seal into the water. Loosen the hair, bind it to the east, stir the water thrice with the left hand, tread upon the hair with the right foot, then retreat twenty-four paces. Cast the water into the chamber pot—let no one witness this. Conclude the visualization of the seal’s *qi* and the method.
