*The Pengzu Treatise on Nurturing Life and Cultivating Nature*

**Title:** *Pengzu Treatise on Nurturing Life and Cultivating Nature* (also known as *Treatise on Nurturing Life and Cultivating Nature*). Author unknown. One juan. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Methods* category.

Those whose spirit is strong attain long life; those whose qi is strong perish swiftly.
To be yielding and reverent is the strength of spirit.
To rage and indulge one’s will is the strength of qi.

When one’s thoughts strain beyond their capacity, the will is harmed.
When one’s strength is overtaxed beyond its limit, the body is harmed.
Unceasing sorrow injures the hun-spirit.
Unceasing grief scatters the po-spirit.
Excessive joy and anger prevent the spirit from returning to its abode.
Fickle love and hatred prevent the spirit from guarding the form.

Restless desire wearies the spirit; obsessive thought corrupts it.
Prolonged laughter injures the viscera.
Prolonged sitting or standing injures the sinews and bones.
Irregular sleep harms the liver.
Fatigue from exertion harms the spleen.
Drawing the bow and bending the crossbow injure the sinews.
Climbing heights and descending slopes injure the kidneys.
Drunkenness and vomiting injure the lungs.
Overeating followed by lying down injures the qi.
Galloping on horseback or running on foot injures the stomach.
Shouting and cursing injure the gallbladder.

Failure to harmonize yin and yang gives rise to sores and ulcers.
Excess in the bedchamber brings forth exhaustion and emaciation.

Moreover, a human life spans but a single generation—a distant term of no more than thirty thousand days.
Not a day passes without some harm;
not a day is spent in repair.
Yet one vainly blames the spirit for not guarding the body,
the body for not remaining sound.
Is this not difficult indeed?
How lamentable!

Thus, the methods of nurturing life prescribe: do not spit at a distance, do not walk in haste. The ears should not be strained to hear, the eyes should not be fixed in prolonged gaze. Sitting should not reach exhaustion, lying down should not extend to excess. Clothe yourself before the cold arrives, disrobe after the heat has come. Avoid extreme hunger, for hunger harms the qi. Do not overeat, nor drink to excess when parched, for overindulgence in drink runs deep. Overeating gives rise to masses and accumulations, overdrinking leads to phlegm stagnation and wind-qi congealment. Avoid extreme exertion, avoid extreme idleness. Do not sweat profusely, do not run while drunk, do not ride a horse after a full meal, do not speak excessively, do not feign anger, do not force yourself to eat rich or fresh foods, do not expose your head after washing your hair. In winter, avoid extreme warmth; in summer, avoid extreme cold. Extreme warmth in winter brings spring epidemics, extreme cold in summer brings autumn malaria and dysentery. Do not expose yourself beneath the stars and moon, do not approach corpses while hungry, do not fan yourself while asleep, do not eat with your head uncovered, do not drink cold water while overheated, do not rush from intense cold to a blazing stove, do not face fierce winds after bathing, do not remove clothes while drenched in sweat, do not plunge into cold water while overheated, do not urinate or defecate facing the sun, moon, or the Northern Dipper, do not expose your body beneath the stars, do not charge through frost, mist, or mountain vapors. All these harm the viscera and dissipate the spirit and soul.

The five flavors must not be indulged to excess: too much sourness harms the spleen, too much bitterness harms the lungs, too much acridity harms the liver, too much sweetness harms the kidneys, too much saltiness harms the heart. These correspond to the five phases, subtly governing the four limbs—this can be reasoned and investigated. Scholars and gentlemen ought to take heed. Violating these principles will not immediately cause harm, but over time, they accumulate into decline and decay.

Therefore, the heart is the master of the five viscera, qi the messenger of the hundred limbs. In action, harmony is the steed; in circulation, serenity is the chariot. When joints and labor grow weary, lie down and practice *daoyin*. If one does not cultivate the arts of nurturing and care, does not follow the Dao of peace and harmony, qi will falter in an instant, the body wither amid sensual pleasures. The fleeting self is wearied, melancholy thoughts consume the heart. Upon hearing this Dao, one should deeply cultivate and guard it.

Thus, the perfected person always remains tranquil, never indulging in reckless abandon. Yet fools, before their desires are even fulfilled, have already harmed their bodies, dissipated their spirit and soul, and injured their *po*. How lamentable!
