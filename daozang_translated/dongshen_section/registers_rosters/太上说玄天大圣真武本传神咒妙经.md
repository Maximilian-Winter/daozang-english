**The Supreme Lord’s Scripture of the Wondrous Incantations of the Divine Transmission of the Dark Heaven Great Sage Perfected Warrior**

We reverently invoke the Dark Heaven Great Sage:
The numinous spirit of the northern *ren* and *gui*,
True Honored One of the Golden Tower, incarnate transformation,
Peerless General named Perfected Warrior.
Majestic countenance blazes as the Supreme Yin Lord,
His radiance drawn from the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations.
Eyes flash lightning to subdue drought demons,
Ten thousand riders like clouds command the Nine Earths.
Clad in purple robes, girded with a golden sash, he grasps his divine blade;
A verdant tortoise and colossal serpent bear his sacred feet.
Six *Ding* and six *Jia* spirits attend left and right,
Eight Slayer Generals guard before and behind.
His power to dispel calamity and bestow blessings defies reckoning—
We bow in devotion, offering homage with single-minded reverence.

At that time, the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity, on the Central Day of the First Yuan of the Dragon Han Era, within the North Polar Palace of the Great Clarity’s realm, before the Purple Tenuity Hall, assembled the sagely hosts of all heavens: the Northern and Southern Dippers, the Eastern and Western Courts, the Five Stars of the Five Directions, the Six Luminaries of the Six Palaces, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Palace Spirits, the Flying Heavenly Kings, and the boundless immortals. All drew near the imperial throne, reverently awaiting his august command.

Then a Jade Youth conveyed the Emperor’s decree:
“To the Great General of the North, the Dark Warrior General: You shall heed the sacred mandate of the Jade Emperor. Thrice each month, you shall lead the divine legions to traverse all heavens, conducting thorough inspections. Wherever you encounter perverse *qi* or malevolent stars straying from their courses, swiftly execute them. Moreover, on the Three Primals, Eight Festivals, *jiazi*, *gengshen* days, and each monthly cyclical sign, descend to the lower realms. Record the good, punish the wicked, aid the upright, and expel the perverse. Rescue and deliver the celestial and human, quell demons and seize toxins. Thus shall you fulfill the supreme will—be diligent in this duty.”

At that moment, the Perfected One named Wondrous Conduct stepped forth from the ranks, prostrated before the Emperor, and said: “Your servant, by past karmic affinity, has been privileged to hear the wondrous principle. The Great General of the North, the Dark Warrior General, patrols the heavens and humanity, recording good and punishing evil. Yet I know not by what karmic cause this general manifests, nor what divine powers he wields to subdue gods and demons. I humbly beseech Your August Majesty to grant this foolish one a measure of enlightenment.”

Then the Supreme Emperor, leaning upon his armrest, replied: “Excellent, Perfected One, that you inquire on behalf of the mortal realm! Yet the karmic cause of the Dark Warrior’s manifestation is vast and unfathomable, subtle and beyond comprehension. For he is the incarnate transformation of the Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor, the divine marvel that protects and delivers the celestial and human. The Dao is formless, beyond all imagery; its transformations are myriad, its emptiness inscrutable. Now, the Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor has manifested eighty-one times as the Venerable Lord and eighty-two times as the Dark Warrior. Thus we know the Dark Warrior is the transformed body of the Venerable Lord, the numinous verification of the *Wuqu* star. His essence arises from the two constellations *Xu* and *Wei*, the fusion of water and fire. Sometimes armored, clad in robes; sometimes booted, yet barefoot. Ever with disheveled azure locks, ever wielding his divine blade, his voice shakes the Nine Heavens, his might pervades the Four Quarters. Where he advances, dark mists gather; where he treads, the verdant tortoise and colossal serpent follow. His divine soldiers and generals number fifty million; jade boys and jade maidens attend him in twenty-four ranks. He bears the Numinous Talisman of the North Emperor and the Treasure Seal of *Qianyuan*. To command him is to summon Thunder Lords and Lightning Mothers; to escort him are Wind Lords and Rain Masters. The Eight Slayer Generals guard his front and rear; the Six *Jia* Generals follow left and right. The Celestial Stem *Tiangang* and Great Unity lead his vanguard; Earth Lords and City Gods obey his commands. He annihilates all demons and aids all goodness. He ascends the Golden Tower and hastens to Kunlun, opens the Gate of Heaven and seals the Door of Earth. In the obscure and indistinct, he discerns all destinies. Dwelling in the *ren* and *gui* direction, he assists the *jia* and *geng* generals. Sometimes he rides a dark steed, sometimes strides a verdant rainbow. His eyes flash like lightning, his brows arch like cloud formations. His body spans a thousand *zhang*, his crown bears the Three Terraces. When he moves, mountains and waters tremble; when he is still, heaven and earth harmonize. By such manifestations does his divine power become known.”

Then the Perfected One bowed again and said: “Your servant is most fortunate to receive these sacred words. Yet if the Dark Warrior General is the manifestation of the Mysterious Origin, how did his origins begin? I humbly beseech Your Majesty to elucidate, that my ignorance may be dispelled.”

Thereupon, the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity expounded in profound discourse, revealing the cause and resolving the supreme mystery.

“Long ago, in the Palace of No Desire in the Great Luo Realm, Queen Consort Shansheng of the Kingdom of Pure Joy dreamed she swallowed the sun and, upon waking, conceived. Her *qi* rejected all perversity; daily she cultivated the Dao. After fourteen months—more than four hundred days—on the third day of the third month in the *jiachen* year of the Kaihuang Era, at the hour of *wu*, she gave birth within the palace. His appearance was extraordinary. When he matured, he renounced his home, bid farewell to his parents, and entered Mount Wudang to cultivate the Dao. After forty-two years, his merit complete and fruitfulness fulfilled, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Jade Emperor issued an edict, enfeoffing him as the Supreme Mystery and entrusting him to guard the North. Such was the beginning of his manifested traces.”

The Perfected One bowed again and addressed the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity: “The Jade Emperor’s edict of enfeoffment must bear a wondrous intent. I venture to inquire of its general purport, that my meager understanding may be enlightened.”

At that time, the Emperor replied to Wondrous Conduct: “The celestial scriptures are secret—how may they be proclaimed? To reveal heavenly mechanisms would be most improper. The hidden language of the Great Brahma—how may it be made known to all?”

The Perfected One Wondrous Conduct bowed and prostrated himself, then petitioned again: “Though your servant’s karmic affinity is slight, surely Your Sagely Majesty’s grace is boundless.”

Turning his thoughts to the assembled Perfected, the Emperor deigned to grant great favor. Should one treat these mysteries with careless disdain, one would fall into evil destinies, suffering as a lowly ghost for ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths.

At that time, the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity, moved by this Perfected One’s earnest devotion and repeated petitions, revealed the imperial kalpa to all the Perfected. These secret words, inscribed in golden seal-script upon a tablet a full *zhang* in breadth, were called the Heavenly Talisman. Whoever beheld it would dwell forever among the Celestial Immortals; whoever heard it would never pass through hell.

The edict read:

From the Golden Portals of the Vast Heaven, under the Threefold Review,
A missive is issued to the youth of sacred kalpa-study and immortal learning, the Prince of Pure Joy Kingdom:
Only you, transformed by the Mysterious Origin and revered as the One of Heaven, teach without words. None know your divine subtlety—boundless as the kalpas, towering as the *ren*.
If one preserves emptiness in the heart and substance in the belly, harmonizing one’s light with the dust,
Carving open creation and scattering the simplicity of the primal chaos,
For six million years, through eighty-two bodies,
Bending the straight to save the crooked, filling the hollow and renewing the worn,
Generating yin and nurturing yang, raising the dead to life—
Such merit asks no reward; such virtue is true.
Now you shall manifest once more, eternally guarding the Northern Heavens.
Above, you shall punish rebellious omens; below, you shall extinguish demonic vapors.
Holding the talismanic registers, you shall subdue and restrain demonic traces.
At the assembly of the Imperial Perfected, you shall drive spirits and ride dragons.
The Generals of Jia and Geng shall assist and protect your merit.
Encircling the Six Directions, you shall universally bless the people.
Your Dao parallels Heaven and Earth; all spirits defer to you.
You are hereby specially appointed as Supreme Marshal of the Mysterious Origin, charged with overseeing the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and Celestial Transitions.
Upon receipt of this decree, act accordingly.

The Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity then addressed the Perfected One: “This text is the Jade Emperor’s secret edict, the august proclamation of the Heavenly Thearch. It must not be lightly transmitted, lest one incur divine censure.”

The Perfected One bowed deeply and again addressed the Emperor: “I have heard that the Mysterious Warrior General possesses boundless divine power, yet does not occupy the ranks of the deities but instead guards the North. What is the wondrous cause of this efficacy? What is the profound covenant of his numinous clarity? I humbly beseech an explanation to dispel my ignorance.”

The Emperor’s voice responded to the Perfected One: “In the North above the Central Heaven, all the luminaries pay homage. Without the most divine, who could restrain and suppress?”

The Perfected One then inquired of the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity: “If there are those among the heavenly and earthly who reverently aspire to the Mysterious Warrior General, what blessings and benefits may they obtain?”

The Emperor replied: “This divine general, on the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of every month, undergoes celestial review and patrols the Ten Caves. Additionally, on the seventh day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the ninth day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the thirteenth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the twenty-first day of the tenth month, the seventh day of the eleventh month, and the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, he descends to the human realm to sever demonic influences, expel pestilence, protect lives, and ensure longevity, thus fulfilling the mandate of Heaven. Those whose qi is upright and whose hearts are pure, who are wholly loyal and perfectly filial, shall have their names inscribed on jade tablets and be recommended for ascension to immortality. There are further esoteric regulations too numerous to recount.”

The Perfected One bowed again and addressed the Supreme Emperor of Purple Tenuity: “I have now heard the cause of his manifest transformation. How may those who revere the Mysterious Warrior General pay homage? What expedient means may they employ to obtain blessings and benefits? I humbly request your instruction.”

At that time, the Emperor addressed the Perfected One: “Within Heaven and Earth, those who with sincere devotion worship the Mysterious Warrior—who, in their lifetime, abstain from foul and rank foods, from poisoned or polluted substances, from onions, garlic, leeks, and coriander, from indulgence in lust and desire, and from assisting in births or handling corpses—if they can sever these attachments, then they may aspire with true devotion. On the days of his descent, they shall receive auspicious blessings. On those nights, they must first purify body and mind, stilling all distracting thoughts.”

By the fifth watch, one should personally prepare incense and candles, pure fruits, and jujube broth, arranging them in three positions. With single-minded devotion, bow deeply and pray—no wish shall go unanswered. Then, with purified thoughts and utmost sincerity, recite the divine incantation:

*In the northern darkness of the Mysterious Heaven,
The profound and distant Divine Lord.
With countless transformations,
The numinous truth of the Dark Warrior.
Soaring through the skies, overturning the earth,
Driving thunder and racing clouds.
With a host of ten thousand, sweeping away demonic miasma.
Thunder Lords attend as retainers,
Jade Maidens serve as generals.
Ghosts and spirits submit in surrender,
Dragons and tigers flee in concealment.
Vigilant over the Five Peaks,
All spirits obey in reverence.
Striking bells and beating drums,
Patrolling the cosmos.
Seizing rebellious ghosts,
Crushing and slaying demonic hordes.
Expelling evil and aiding the upright,
The Dao’s qi ever draws near.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Sovereign’s decree commands!*

*Born of the Great Yin,
Essence of the Water Palace.
Corresponding above to the Void and Danger constellations,
Serpent and Tortoise conjoined in form.
Roaming the Nine Lands,
Commanding the myriad spirits.
No hidden place unperceived,
No wish unfulfilled.
From kalpa’s end to kalpa’s beginning,
Severing and vanquishing demonic essences.
Rescuing and protecting all beings,
Bringing peace to households and nations.
When the kalpa nears its close and the final *jia* day arrives,
Demon miasmas spread unchecked.
The Celestial Sovereign, in his might,
Thus sends me forth in spirit.
To propagate the true teaching,
Dispel evil, and repel weapons.
Transforming and harmonizing the multitudes,
Aiding the restoration of the central realm.
Should any petty ghost dare appear,
My gaze alone shall topple the Five Peaks.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Great Mystery’s decree commands!*

The Wondrous Practitioner of the Dao said: “The marvel of merit and the cause of manifest responses—I have humbly heard them and my confusion is dispelled. Yet there are those among the barbarian tribes, the foolish and dull-witted, who may hear these words but hold no faith in their hearts. If there are indeed karmic retributions, may you reveal them in brief.”

The Purple Tenuity Great Emperor replied: “Though they be foolish and dull, they must recognize heat and cold. Though they dwell among barbarians, they must know suffering and joy. Those who believe shall find their spirits and souls clear and refreshed; those who defy shall be ensnared by misfortune and calamity. Thus may they become impoverished despite wealth, or bear many children despite poverty; their sons may perish by the sword in war, their daughters may suffer harm from illicit pregnancies. Constantly entangled in lawsuits, ever mired in the sea of suffering, their estates dwindle, their resources dissipate. Such is the consequence of their own faults, the cause they have reaped. Where this divine general presides, fierce demons lower their heads, and perverse paths vanish. Therefore, those who revere him shall find blessings arising like clouds, while disasters scatter like lightning. You have earnestly inquired, and so I reveal this mechanism, tracing the subtle origins of the Dao’s principles, that the people of heaven may receive great felicity. Though my words are concise, I wish you to understand them clearly. Were it not for one such as yourself, this should remain secret.”

The Perfected One said: “May I hear of the wondrous workings of this principle?”

The Great Emperor replied: “Formerly, on the Shangyuan Festival of the first year of *Yongshou*, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, upon the Eight Radiant Celestial Palace, seated upon the Five Clouds Throne, addressed the Thirty-Six Celestial Sovereigns, the Seventy-Two Perfected Ones of the Blessed Lands, the boundless Flying Celestial Great Spirits, the Limitless Longevity Great Sages, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, the Nine Phoenixes and Eight Simurghs, all arrayed in resplendent attendance to left and right. The Eight Sounds resonated of themselves, and all the sages rejoiced. Solemnly, they listened as the Celestial Worthy expounded the wondrous Dharma of the utmost truth. The Dao’s qi was purified, encircling the supreme Mystery of the Primordial Origin, delving into the subtleties of its profound principles.

Suddenly, from the northeast of the Celestial Gate, seven great peals of thunder resounded, and ten thousand eyes turned as one to behold the grievances of the lower realm, where demonic miasmas coiled upward to the heavens. The assembled Perfected fell silent, and the Great Dao stood still. Then, the Wondrous Practitioner of the Dao inquired as to the cause.

The Primordial One, having expounded the wondrous Dharma and gathered auspicious signs, asked: ‘What extraordinary cause has provoked this disturbance? May you reveal its profound import to resolve the doubts of all.’

The Great Emperor said: ‘The people of the Lower Kalpa all receive the utmost Dao, endowed with the pure qi of primordial chaos to sustain their mortal forms. Yet now, as the kalpic destiny nears its end, demonic forces gradually grow strong. They follow only perverse paths, forgetting their original source, delighting in the worship of evil spirits, and flatteringly seeking fleeting blessings. Bewildered and confused, greedy and obstinate, they are neither righteous nor benevolent, neither loyal nor filial. Now, the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens and the Five Offices of Pestilence, disregarding the proper order, wrongfully bring harm—whether old or young, male or female—cutting short their allotted years and forcing them to abandon the world before their time. Thus, their lonely souls, filled with resentment, surge upward in a coil that cannot disperse. Such violent deaths are truly pitiable.’

The Wondrous Practitioner of the Dao then addressed the Primordial One: ‘The assembled Perfected pity these beings—by what means may they be delivered?’

The Celestial Worthy struck his teeth once, and a radiance streamed ten thousand miles to the north, summoning the Great Mystery General to sever the demonic hordes and rescue all beings.

The Perfected One asked: ‘By what cause does this general hold dominion over the northern quarter, subduing lower ghosts and sweeping away demonic miasmas?’

The Great Emperor replied: ‘Before the unfolding of creation, this spirit already embodied divine numinosity. Assuming names and titles, he delivered people and aided the world, never boasting of his virtues nor priding himself on his abilities. For this, the Jade Emperor enfeoffed him as the Dark Warrior.’

The Perfected One said: ‘How may this general descend to the lower realm to deliver all beings, sparing them from violent deaths, liberating the dead, and ensuring the living’s well-being?’

The Celestial Worthy issued a flying talisman to summon the general. The Dark Warrior, receiving the decree, led his divine troops to the Crimson Steps of the Never-Night Palace, where he beheld the Great Dao of mighty renown. Bowing deeply, he knelt and addressed the Celestial Worthy: ‘By what cause today do I merit this special summons? I am fortunate to behold your compassionate countenance—what is the purport of your wondrous decree?’ Kneeling upon the alchemical platform, he reverently received the command.

The Celestial Worthy declared: ‘I observe the lower realm, where grievances surge to the heavens. All are alarmed, and the exalted Perfected pity them. You shall go there—proceed with reverence!’”

Thus did the Dark Warrior receive the mandate and take leave of Heaven. Turning his radiance inward, he unbound his hair and went barefoot, treading upon the tortoise and serpent. His immortal retinue surged forth like thunder, celestial warriors arrayed in resplendent guard. In an instant, he traversed the cosmos—shearing the cruel and venomous demons, mending the wanton ravages of pestilence. The souls of the netherworld found rebirth; suffering and sickness departed. The living and the dead were sundered; grievances dissolved. The common folk dwelt in peace; the land knew tranquility.

The Dark Warrior beheld the Celestial Worthy once more and recounted the power of the Dao. The work accomplished, the task fulfilled, the turbid descended and the pure ascended. Withdrawing his auspicious radiance, he returned to his original station, aligning the celestial pivots and directing the earthly forces, aiding the Gate of Heaven above.

Then he intoned the incantation:

In the Great Beginning, in the Great Simplicity,
Formless and imageless,
None knew the heavy and turbid,
Who could discern the light and pure?
Within the primordial chaos, I divided darkness and light.
Heaven gained its vigor,
Earth gained its stability,
The people gained their sustenance,
All things gained their sprouting.
The perverse were rectified,
The spirits gained their numinosity.
Within the Three Powers,
All myriad beings flourished.

When the Great Dao dispersed,
Benevolence and righteousness arose.
When rites and music were established,
Deceit and perversity followed.
The Six Principles faltered,
The Four Peoples contended.
Above, there was no magnanimity,
Below, no loyalty or integrity.
Demons and ghosts,
Goblins and spirits,
Rampant in their venom,
Disturbed the living.
Entire households fell ill,
Years burdened by misfortune.
Wealth dissipated,
Kin were left forlorn.
Lives passed away,
Calamities entwined.
Foul and noxious qi
Ascended to the celestial court.

The Celestial Worthy issued his command,
Bidding me to restore peace.
All demons were sheared,
All ghosts were seared.
The officers of pestilence
Bound their heads in submission.
Ghostly spirits were extinguished,
Evil demons were overthrown.

I possess ten billion fierce warriors,
Fifty million divine troops.
In Heaven above,
On Earth below,
They follow my descent and ascent.
Those who resist me perish,
Those who obey me live.
Those who revile me are shamed,
Those who revere me are honored.
Those who honor me gain longevity,
Those who defy me meet their end.

By this decree,
Both humans and ghosts heed.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Great Mysterious Law commands!

At that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected, the immeasurable flying heavenly divine kings, and the assembly of perfected immortals, having heard these words, leapt forth in reverence, praising the merit and virtue. The secret registers, sealed in jade caskets, were later transmitted to the mortal world by banished immortals. Those devoted to the Dao bowed their heads in devotion and put them into practice.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Incantation of the Great Sage of the Dark Heaven, the Perfected Warrior, as Spoken by the Most High*.
