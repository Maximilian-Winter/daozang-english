### The Primordial Sovereign Mother

The Primordial Sovereign Mother was born of the Dark Congealment of the Cavernous Yin and Mysterious Harmony, also styled the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden, and served as the Teacher of the Supreme Emperor.

The Most High Lord Lao, in the primordial chaos, nurtured spirit through kalpas of transformation, responding to the hidden and manifest in ways beyond reckoning. When he wished to manifest in the human realm to demonstrate the origin of all things, he dispersed his form and divided his spirit, entrusting his embryo to the Primordial Mother to be reborn.

In the distant kalpa of boundless vastness, he often entrusted his birth to the Heavenly Ridge and Spirit Mirror Mountain. In the eighth year of King Yang Jia of the Shang, the *gengshen* year, Lord Lao rode the essence of the sun, driving a nine-dragon chariot wreathed in mist, gradually diminishing to the size of a nine-colored pellet. Descending from heaven, he entrusted himself to the womb of the Primordial Mother. At that time, the Primordial Mother was in the Quren hamlet of Lai County in the Chu state, napping by the banks of the Wo Spring in broad daylight. She perceived a solar image like a shooting star, which entered her mouth, and thus conceived. For eighty-one years, the chamber where she resided was constantly filled with fragrant qi and the radiance of the sun and moon. Divine luminosity crowned her, guarding her body, and her countenance remained resplendent and untiring.

In the ninth year of King Wu Ding of the Shang, the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month, the Primordial Mother gave birth while grasping a plum tree, delivering him from her left armpit. At that moment, nine dragons surged from the earth, leaping into the sky and spouting water to bathe Lord Lao. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed, which remain to this day—these are the Nine Wells of the Supreme Clarity Palace in Bozhou.

As soon as Lord Lao was born, he could walk nine steps, with a lotus blossoming beneath each foot. The sun and moon cast their brilliance, and the myriad spirits attended him. Pointing to the plum tree, he declared, "This is my surname." Thus, he took the surname Li, and people also called the Primordial Mother "Mother Li."

After walking nine steps, he pointed his left hand to heaven and his right hand to earth, saying, "Between heaven and earth, only I am revered. How can the sufferings of the world be worth delighting in?" Within three days, his body underwent nine transformations, growing nine feet tall, with green eyebrows and white hair, a sun-like forehead and moon-like temples, a nose with twin pillars, ears with three openings, fine brows and a square mouth. He trod the Five Phases and grasped the Ten Directions, possessing the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, all perfectly arrayed upon his body.

Because he was born with a white head, the Primordial Mother named him Laozi ("Old Master"). Some say he declared nine names for himself, while others claim he had thirty-six titles and seventy-two names. The *Mysterious Wondrous Inner Fascicle* states: "When Lord Lao was born, the gods of heaven and earth gathered in his courtyard. The Solar Youth scattered radiance, the Lunar Consort cast flowers. The Seven Primes shone brilliantly, the Three Pures filled the courtyard. Myriad blossoms exhaled fragrance, and lotuses sprouted from the earth. Divine youths and mysterious maidens flanked him on either side. Ethereal music resounded, and celestial melodies startled the sky."

Thereafter, Lord Lao attended the Primordial Mother, secretly expounding the wondrous Dao, intending to broadly transform the myriad beings and greatly propagate the Orthodox and True.

At leisure, the Primordial Mother said to Lord Lao: "I observe that the body is but a borrowed vessel of the Six Houses. What are the Six Houses? The Wood Spirit of *jiayin* governs the bones, the Metal Spirit of *jiashen* governs the teeth and nails, the Earth Spirit of *jiaxu* governs the flesh, the Wind Spirit of *jiachen* governs the breath, the Fire Spirit of *jiawu* governs warmth, and the Water Spirit of *jiazi* governs moisture. Furthermore, the Wood Spirit governs the liver, the Fire Spirit the heart, the Earth Spirit the spleen, the Metal Spirit the lungs, the Water Spirit the kidneys, and the Wind Spirit the eyes—these Six Houses together constitute the human body. Thus, there are the five viscera and six bowels, the nine palaces and twelve chambers, the four limbs and five constituents, the three *nao* and nine orifices, the one hundred eighty joints, and the three hundred sixty bones and nodes, each residing in its proper place. Therefore, one can move, see, breathe, eat, speak, distinguish likes and dislikes, and know right from wrong. If one house is disharmonious, illness arises.

Human life is determined by the year, month, day, and hour of birth, governed by the corresponding stellar lodges, which fix one’s poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness, and the length of one’s lifespan. Yet the vessels of the Six Houses are subject to convergence and dispersion, birth and death, formation and decay, flourishing and decline—this is the constant principle of things. The body has its destined moment of decay, the spirit its destined time of dispersion, and life its inevitable end—how fearful this is!

When the spirit abides, one is human; when it departs, one becomes a corpse—how grievous! This arises because the five colors confuse the eyes, causing blindness; the five sounds disturb the ears, causing deafness; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing numbness. Preferences and aversions agitate the heart, causing it to fly astray; desires and cravings scatter the spirit without restraint; hatred and love unsettle the heart, causing it to labor and fret. If one does not swiftly cast these aside, one’s will and qi will daily diminish, and one’s lifespan will daily wane—how can one not be vigilant?

The five colors are daggers that pierce the eyes; the five sounds are hammers that deafen the ears; the five flavors are axes that sever the tongue; and the multitude of goods are fires that consume the body. These are the palaces of calamity and the chambers of misfortune."

The Primordial Mother said: "Those who esteem long life begin with the self, then extend to their homeland, and finally to the world. As children, they fulfill filial piety; as subjects, they fulfill loyalty; as superiors, they fulfill love; as inferiors, they fulfill obedience. They harmonize colors and flavors, aligning with the Dao and uniting with the True. If one merely seeks long life for oneself alone, dwelling in non-action for long, evading superiors and inferiors, neglecting loyalty and filial piety, forsaking universal salvation, and practicing partial goodness contrary to the Dao, one loses virtue. Even if one can abandon fear of self and others, forget the pleasures of colors and flavors, and become like withered wood or dead ashes, what is there to value?"

The practitioner of the Dao must be at ease without encumbrance, harmonious and ever-permeable, enduring through kalpas without end, delivering all beings—only then is long life truly worthy of esteem. Long life is rare to attain, for it arises from loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. When loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are established, merit extends to all things, and life naturally endures. Those devoid of such virtue, who merely seclude themselves in mountains and forests, consorting with trees and stones, waste their lives in vain. Later, they fall into suffering; past sins remain unexpiated, and present deeds bear no merit. Thus, they lose the human way, reborn among border barbarians or as flying and submerged creatures—belonging to base and alien kinds, forever severed from the Dao. How deeply lamentable!

If one can cultivate goodness, joy and life will abide; if one engages in evil, death and suffering will reach their utmost. The superior person accumulates goodness and attains enduring long life, known as a *zhenren*. When heaven and earth crumble, the *zhenren* remains indestructible, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely in the Upper Clarity.

Yet a single evil may lead to ten thousand evils, serving as a warning. Among ordinary people, those with a thousand evils will have rebellious and monstrous descendants; two thousand evils reduce one to servitude; three thousand evils bring the six afflictions and destitution; four thousand evils lead to epidemics and exile; five thousand evils condemn one to the Five Hells as a ghost; six thousand evils make one a prisoner in the Twenty-Eight Hells; seven thousand evils cast one into the various regional hells; eight thousand evils plunge one into the Frozen Hell; nine thousand evils consign one to the Edge-Bottom Hell; ten thousand evils cast one into the *Bili* Hell. The foundation of ten thousand evils lies in the Three Karmas, each giving rise to the next until ten thousand evils accumulate. Those who fall into the *Bili* Abyss have no hope of deliverance, forever lost in boundless emptiness—how grievous!

If one becomes aware of even a single evil, one should swiftly correct it and refrain from further transgression, thus drawing near to the Dao. Should one be afflicted by demonic or perverse influences, one must purify the heart, reproach oneself, repent, and cultivate anew—thereby transforming evil into goodness.

A single good deed brings calm to the heart and peace to the spirit; ten good deeds strengthen qi and vitality; a hundred good deeds summon auspicious omens; a thousand good deeds bestow divine and true descendants; two thousand good deeds make one a divine and true immortal officer; three thousand good deeds elevate one to a divine and true immortal minister; four thousand good deeds make one a master and teacher of the world, a divine and true immortal sovereign; five thousand good deeds make one a divine and true immortal leader; six thousand good deeds elevate one to a divine and true immortal minister of state; seven thousand good deeds make one a divine and true immortal duke or king; eight thousand good deeds make one a divine and true immortal emperor; nine thousand good deeds elevate one to the Primordial Five Thearchs; ten thousand good deeds make one the Supreme Jade Emperor.

The Primordial Mother said: The foundation of ten thousand good deeds also lies in the Three Karmas; ten good deeds generate one another, culminating in ten thousand. Good deeds augment one’s allotted span, while evil deeds diminish it. Reward for goodness and punishment for evil are each overseen by their respective offices—the principle of karmic retribution is precise to the finest detail.

The root of long life lies solely in goodness as its foundation. Be vigilant and strive earnestly.

The Primordial Mother said: Human beings exist within heaven and earth, possessing purity and turbidity, hardness and softness. Through cultivation, each develops their nature accordingly. Those with pure qi are wise, intelligent, and virtuous; those with turbid qi are cruel, violent, and foolish. Those with hard qi are lofty, stern, and resolute; those with soft qi are kind, benevolent, sincere, and steadfast. Thus, the nature of wood is strong and upright; the nature of earth is kind and harmonious; the nature of water is modest and yielding; the nature of fire is fierce and vehement; the nature of metal is stern and brittle—each follows what it receives to determine its nature.

The wise subdue and refine their nature to prolong their lives; the foolish indulge their desires and harm their nature. Nature is the source of life, and life is the root of existence. Strive to cultivate it, diligently refine it—thus nurturing life to nourish one’s nature, guarding the spirit to nourish one’s life. Then one escapes suffering and ascends to joy, and blessings endure without end.

Moreover, human life arises from the spirit: when the spirit abides, life continues; when the spirit departs, life ends. Thus, accumulating qi forms essence; accumulating essence forms spirit; accumulating spirit leads to long life.

The Primordial Mother said: Worldly people know only to indulge in rich delicacies to please the palate, unaware that fine food harms life. They seek only rank and emolument to glorify themselves, unaware that the extravagance of rank and wealth harms the self. Therefore, those who cultivate and study refine the body with the Nine Elixirs, untie the knots of the Five Spirits, guide qi back to its origin, and sever the roots at the Three Passes. After nine refinements and ten transformations, with a hundred joints illuminated, and the fetal knots dissolved, one knows the original truth. Knowing the original truth, one becomes an Upper Immortal.

The immortal is one who studies and recognizes the heart to become immortal. The Dao is attained through inner seeking and inner secrecy. The True is realized through cultivating quiescence and profound stillness. The spirit is made efficacious through accumulated resonance and response. Constantly abiding in unity brings one near to immortality. If the heart competes and the spirit labors, the body wearies and focus scatters; movement and stillness dissipate essence, and the ears and eyes seek broad clarity—then, though one accumulates effort in vain pursuit of the Dao, the Dao grows ever more distant.

Those who do not cultivate the Dao are like illusions, merely dwelling briefly in the space between heaven and earth. If one can gather qi to nourish the spirit, endure hardship to infuse the True, and persist long enough to attain the Dao, then upon its realization, one shares the same dwelling as heaven and earth within the Great Primordium. Further, if one can penetrate emptiness and embody the Primordial, then one shares the same dwelling as the Great Primordium within the quiescent. One who can penetrate quiescence is unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to—merged indistinguishably with the Dao.

The Primordial Mother said: The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and permeability. Guarding it is the profound and wondrous reliance of transformation. The Dao has no fixed form; it employs techniques to deliver people. Human beings possess numinous awareness, and through cultivation, they align with the Dao. Those who can study it find transformation occurring naturally.

The essentials of the Dao lie in profound simplicity. The secrets of its practices are found only in talismans, medicines, and the Mysterious. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, the true pledge of heaven.

Medicines are the essence and blossom of the Five Phases, the refined sap of the earth. The Mysterious is the harmony and purity of yin and yang, the numinous clarity of the myriad beings. These three are the essential mechanism for attaining the Dao, the treasures sought by those who pursue immortality. One who can master all three may abide forever and transcend the limits of human existence.

The Primordial Mother said: How is the Dao made manifest? Its vastness depends upon human beings. Medicines refine the body; talismans summon the spirits. When spirits return, the heart becomes permeable; when the body is fortified, the Mysterious is secured. When spirit is whole, the Mysterious is firm, and the body is restored to strength, life may be preserved. Only after life is preserved can one transform the Mysterious into essence, penetrate the primordial form, and soar through the void. Life and death become natural, and one may endure forever.

Those who attain the Dao, though the great kalpas turn and heaven and earth collapse, cannot be harmed by calamity—such is the power of talismans and medicines.

The Primordial Mother said: The arts of treasured scriptures and transformations, the techniques of returning cinnabar and golden liquor, once comprised seventy-two scrolls, but now there are only nine. In three volumes, each containing three scrolls, the middle volume’s three scrolls are the true *Dan Jing*. The first is *Mysterious White*, the second *Golden Essence*, the third *Flying Talisman*, the fourth *Golden Florescence*, and the fifth *Three-Fives*—these are called the Five Talismans. The first is *White Snow*, the second *Male and Female*, the third *White Florescence*, the fourth *Golden Liquor*, the fifth *Cinnabar Florescence*, the sixth *Five Colors*, the seventh *Mud and Mercury*, the eighth *Golden Essence*, and the ninth *Nine Cauldrons*—all are named the Ninefold Returning Cinnabar. Obtaining even one elixir grants longevity; one need not complete them all. The way of the divine elixir transforms three times and cycles five to nine times before completion.

If it were herbs and plants, burying them would cause rot, boiling them would make them mushy, and burning them would char them—they cannot sustain themselves, so how could they sustain humans? The way of golden cinnabar is the opposite: the more it is refined, the purer it becomes; the more it cools, the more wondrous it grows. Thus it grants humans longevity. Therefore, the Old Lord refined cinnabar to demonstrate the foundation of Dao cultivation to the world. Today, the cinnabar well in Bozhou still remains.

The Primordial Mother said: Though the nine elixirs are the same, their effects depend on the practitioner’s conduct. Superior adepts who consume them ascend as immortal officials; middling adepts who consume them dwell on Kunlun; lesser adepts who consume them attain longevity in the mortal world.

The Primordial Mother said: The nine elixirs and golden liquor are both paths to ascending heaven. Those who consume the nine elixirs become immortal officials, and cloud-dragons come to welcome their bodies. Those who consume golden liquor develop a golden complexion and may ascend to heaven immediately. Yet this depends on accumulating merit and virtue—divine elixirs come only to those who do so. Without merit and virtue, immortality cannot be hoped for.

Long ago, I transmitted the twelve hundred precepts from the Primordial Heavenly Lord. Through kalpas as numerous as the grains of sand, many were delivered. These teachings were passed down to the Perfected Great Immortals, the Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Lord, the Grand Tenuity, the Great One, the Primordial Mother, and further to the Mysterious Woman and the Yellow Emperor—all attained the Dao.

The Dao does not act in vain; it is only transmitted to the worthy. Those who indulge in pleasure and desire, who linger in the pursuit of sound and beauty, who harbor thoughts of right and wrong—such people are like stones cast into a river, gone without return. How grievous this is!

Yet this Dao is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Ninefold Mysterious Jade Terrace of the Cloudy Peaks, transmitted but once in ten thousand years. Only those whose names are recorded in the Mysterious Register and the Jade Roster may glimpse its contents. Those without the destined bone and form, who have not endured suffering, cannot hear of it.

With these words, the Primordial Mother concluded. Cloud chariots and feathered canopies gathered, and immortal officials stood in solemn array. She then ascended to heaven in her Eight Radiance chariot in broad daylight. The Old Lord, riding a white deer, followed from atop a cypress tree, escorting the immortal procession back to the Great Clarity. Today, the deer’s hoofprints remain on the cypress.

Some say: The Primordial Mother’s position is most exalted and vast. She governs heaven and earth, harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, advances and retreats the Five Stars, measures cold and heat, and holds the reins of the cosmos. All immortals of the Three Realms look up to her in submission. The lives and deaths of humans, the rise and fall of the world—all depend upon her. Thus she is called the Holy Mother of the Old Lord, demonstrating that heaven, earth, and the myriad things must have a source from which they are endowed and a foundation of teacher and resource.

Thereupon, the Great One Primordial Mother expounded the essentials of returning cinnabar and golden liquor to transmit to the mortal world.

**The Primordial Golden Mother**

The Primordial Golden Mother is the Ninefold Numinous and Most Wondrous Turtle Mountain Golden Mother. She is also called the Most Numinous Ninefold Radiance Turtle Terrace Golden Mother, or the Queen Mother of the West. She is the ultimate mystery of the Western Florescence, the supreme honor of the profound yin.

In ancient times, when the Dao and the Mysterious congealed in quiescence, their essence primordial and undifferentiated, they sought to initiate wondrous work and generate the myriad beings. First, from the Eastern Florescence’s most true qi, they transformed and gave birth to Lord Wood. Lord Wood was born upon the Azure Sea, in the wastes of the Blue Numinous, to generate the qi of yang harmony. He governs the East and is also called Lord Wang.

Then, from the Western Florescence’s most wondrous qi, they transformed and gave birth to the Golden Mother. The Golden Mother was born in the Yi River of the Divine Continent, her surname Wei. From birth, she soared and flew, presiding over the qi of yin numinosity. She governs the West and is also called the Queen Mother. Both were endowed with vast, boundless, and profoundly mysterious natures. In the vast wilderness of the West, they divided the pure and refined qi of the great Dao, coalescing qi into form. Together with Lord Wood of the East, they governed the two qi, nurturing heaven and earth and shaping the myriad beings.

Her nature embodies the root of gentleness and compliance, the origin of extreme yin. Her position corresponds to the West, where she mothers and nurtures all beings. All women in heaven, on earth, across the Three Realms, and in the ten directions who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao are under her jurisdiction.

Her palaces and towers reside in the Spring Mountain of Turtle Mountain, within the Kunlun’s Mysterious Orchard and the Terrace of the Board Wind. There are a thousand layers of golden walls, twelve jade towers, towers of jasper radiance, halls of luminous azure, nine-tiered mysterious terraces, and vermilion chambers of purple and emerald. To the left flows the Jasper Pool; to the right winds the Emerald River. Beneath the mountain lie ninefold Weak Waters, with waves ten thousand fathoms high. Only those with wind chariots and feathered wheels may reach it.

The jade towers stand firm against the heavens, while verdant terraces bear the skies. Chambers of azure jasper and chambers of vermilion and purple stretch on, their connected canopies of gemmed silk glowing with the radiance of fourfold moonlight. Adorned with floral crowns and bearing sacred talismans, she is attended on the left by immortal maidens and on the right by feathered youths. Jeweled canopies cast their shimmering light, while feathered screens shade the courtyards. Beneath the balustrades, white-ringed trees and cinnabar-steel groves flourish, their azure hollows numbering ten thousand and their jade trunks reaching a thousand fathoms. Though no wind stirs, divine melodies resound of their own accord, all playing the music of the Eight Harmonies.

The Divine Continent lies to the southeast of Kunlun, and thus the *Erya* states: "Beneath the sun is the Western Queen Mother." It also says: "The Queen Mother wears her hair in a topknot, adorned with a *sheng* ornament, and though she has tiger’s teeth and utters mighty roars, this is but the form of her envoy, the White Tiger Spirit of the Metal Realm—it is not her true appearance." The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed upon her the governance of the myriad heavens and the *Record of the Nine Lights of Turtle Mountain*, charging her to command the ten thousand spirits, unite the perfected sages, oversee oaths and bear witness to vows, and preside over the feathered regalia of all heavens. At the assemblies where the Heavenly Worthy and Supreme Sages gather for feasts and examinations, the Queen Mother is ever present. The precious scriptures of the Highest Clarity and the jade texts of the Three Caverns—all that is transmitted and conferred—are matters in which she plays a part.

In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor sought to quell the unchecked violence of Chiyou, whose sorcery took countless forms—summoning winds and rains, exhaling mists and sprays—his armies were thrown into confusion. The Emperor withdrew to rest at the foot of Mount Tai, lost in troubled slumber, when the Queen Mother dispatched an envoy clad in a black fox-fur robe to present him with a talisman, saying: "With the Great One before you, he who obtains this shall prevail; in battle, he shall be victorious." The talisman measured three inches wide and one foot long, its azure luster like jade, inscribed with vermilion script. Once the Emperor had fastened it, the Queen Mother sent forth a woman with a human head and raven’s body, who addressed him: "I am the Dark Lady of the Nine Heavens." She bestowed upon him the secrets of the Three Palaces and Five Wills, the subtleties of yin and yang, the *Taiyi Dunjia* and *Liuren* methods for pacing the Dipper’s steps, the mechanisms of the *Yin Fu*, and the writings of the Five Numinous Talismans and Five Victories. Thus, he vanquished Chiyou in the heart of Jizhou, succeeding the Divine Farmer and slaying Yu Gang at Ban Spring, bringing great peace to the realm and establishing his capital at Zhuolu in Shanggu.

Years later, the Queen Mother sent the White Tiger Spirit, riding a white tiger, to the Emperor’s court to present him with a terrestrial map. In his later years, she again bestowed upon him the *Way of Pristine Emptiness as the True and Orthodox Dao*, its words declaring: "If eating and drinking never cease, the body will not be light; if thoughts and worries never cease, the spirit will not be clear; if sounds and sights never cease, the heart will not be at peace. When the heart is not at peace, the spirit is not efficacious; when the spirit is not efficacious, the Dao is not achieved." Its essential mystery lies not in gazing at stars or worshipping the Dipper, nor in exhausting the self through ascetic toil, but in maintaining a serene and uncluttered mind, free from restless striving—only then may the Way of immortals be attained, and long life secured.

Later, when Yu Shun assumed the throne, the Queen Mother sent an envoy to present him with a white jade ring and bestowed upon Yi a terrestrial map, expanding the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Provinces into twelve. She also sent an envoy to grant Shun the *Huangguan*, a flute whose music harmonized the Eight Winds.

In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the cyclical year *yimao*, Lord Lao and the perfected one Yin Xi journeyed beyond the Eight Cords to wander west to Turtle Terrace, where they expounded the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* to the Western Queen Mother. Thus, Ge Xuan, the Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, wrote in his preface: "I once received this from the Lord of Eastern Florescence; the Lord of Eastern Florescence received it from the Lord of the Golden Towers; the Lord of the Golden Towers received it from the Western Queen Mother—all transmitted orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I commit it to writing."

In the time of King Mu, he commanded a chariot drawn by eight steeds: to the right, the swift *Yi Li* and to the left, the green-eared *Lü Er*; to the right, the red-maned *Chi Ji* and to the left, the white-hooved *Bai Yao*. The charioteer was Zaofu, with Gaoshang as his right-hand attendant. The second chariot was drawn to the right by *Qu Huang* and to the left by *Yu Shu*, with *Dao Li* to the left and *Zi Baiyao* to the right. Its charioteer was Canbai, with Benrong as his attendant. They galloped a thousand *li* to reach the land of the Giant Sou clan. The Giant Sou presented the blood of a white swan for the king to drink, and prepared a broth of oxen and horses to wash his feet, as well as for the two chariots’ attendants, who drank before setting off again. They lodged for the night at the southern bank of the Red Waters by the foothills of Kunlun, and on another day ascended Kunlun’s heights to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, where they made offerings to secure blessings for posterity. Then they were received as guests by the Western Queen Mother, who feasted them upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang a song for the king, who joined in harmony, their voices mournful. Gazing upon the place where the sun sets—a journey of ten thousand *li* in a single day—the king sighed: "I, alone, am lacking in virtue; will future generations recount my faults?" It is also said that the king presented a white jade tablet and layered brocade as gifts to the Queen Mother, sang the *Song of White Clouds*, and carved an inscription upon the cliffs of Yi Mountain before returning.

Those who ascend to heaven as immortals are divided into nine ranks: the first is the Supreme Immortal, titled *True King of the Nine Heavens*; the second is the Secondary Immortal, titled *True Sovereign of the Three Heavens*; the third is the *Supreme Perfected*; the fourth, the *Flying Celestial*; the fifth, the *Numinous Immortal*; the sixth, the *Perfected*; the seventh, the *Numinous Being*; the eighth, the *Flying Immortal*; and the ninth, the *Immortal*. These ranks must not be transgressed. When the time comes for their ascension, they first pay homage to the Lord of the East, then present themselves to the Queen Mother of the West. Only after completing their duties may they ascend to the Nine Heavens, enter the Three Clarities, and pay reverence to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

Thus, in the early Han dynasty, four or five children were playing by the roadside when one of them sang: "Donning a blue skirt, entering the Gate of Heaven, bowing to the Golden Mother, worshipping the Lord of the East." None present understood its meaning, save Zhang Zifang, who went to pay his respects, saying: "This is the Jade Youth of the Eastern King Father." When immortals attain the Dao and ascend to heaven, they must bow to the Golden Mother and worship the Lord of the East—none but those who have attained emptiness and ascended to perfection know this path.

Emperor Wu of the Han, Liu Che, was fond of the Dao of longevity. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, he ascended Mount Songgao, where he built the Terrace for Seeking the True, fasting and concentrating his spirit in solemn purification. On the wuchen day of the fourth month, the Queen Mother dispatched Wang Zideng, a jade maiden from Tangcheng, to address the Emperor: "I hear that you would forsake the emoluments of the Four Seas and the honor of the myriad chariots to seek the True Dao of longevity. How diligent you are! On the seventh day of the seventh month, I shall come to you briefly."

The Emperor questioned Dongfang Shuo, who confirmed the divine response. Thereupon, the Emperor purified himself for a hundred days, burning incense within the palace. After the second watch of the night, a white cloud arose in the southwest, dense and billowing, advancing directly toward the palace. As it drew near, the clouds and mist turned nine-hued, while the air trembled with the sound of flutes and drums. A host of dragons, phoenixes, men, and horses appeared, accompanied by escorts riding unicorns and deer. Celestial chariots, heavenly steeds, rainbow banners, and feathered standards—thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders—illuminated the palace with their radiance.

The heavenly immortals and attending officials, numbering in the billions, were all over a *zhang* in height. Upon arrival, the attending officials vanished from sight. The Queen Mother rode upon a purple cloud, driving a nine-hued, brindled unicorn. She bore the Heavenly True Staff and wore the Golden Cinnabar Seal. Her robe, woven of yellow brocade, shimmered with brilliant patterns and a golden glow. At her waist hung the Sword of Divided Light and the Great Sash of Flying Clouds. Her hair was bound in a grand floral topknot, crowned with the Morning Tassel of the Supreme True One. Her slippers were embroidered with square jades and phoenixes. Though she appeared no older than twenty, her celestial bearing was serene, her divine countenance unmatched in the world—a true spirit among mortals.

As she descended from her carriage, two maidens assisted her. She ascended the dais and sat facing east, while the Emperor knelt and inquired after her well-being. After standing in attendance for some time, she summoned the Emperor to sit. A heavenly banquet was laid before him: fragrant blossoms, a hundred fruits, purple mushrooms, and divine herbs—exquisite and wondrous, arrayed like clusters of cowries, unlike anything in the mortal world. The Emperor could not name them.

Then she commanded her attendants to bring peaches, seven of which were placed upon a jade plate, each as large as a young bustard. Four were given to the Emperor, while the Queen Mother ate three herself. As the Emperor ate the peaches, he gathered the pits, and the Queen Mother asked why. He replied, "I wish to plant them." She said, "These peaches bear fruit but once every three thousand years. The soil of the mortal realm is too meager—how could they grow?"

Thereupon, the Queen Mother ordered her attendants to perform: Wang Zideng plucked the strings of the Eight Spheres’ Pride, Dong Shuangcheng played the Cloud Harmony flute, Shi Gongzi struck the jade chimes of Kunting, Xu Feiqiong sounded the divine reed of the Trembling Spirit, Wan Linghua tapped the stone of Wuling, Fan Chengjun struck the dark chime of Dongyin, Duan Anxiang played the celestial melody of the Nine Heavens, and Fa Ying sang the song of the Mysterious Spirit. The voices soared, the divine music shook the heavens.

When the song concluded, the Emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and inquired about the Dao of longevity. The Queen Mother said, "If you can despise glory and pleasure, humble your palaces, and delight in emptiness and simplicity, the Dao will naturally return to you. Yet your passions run rampant, your desires are excessive, your indulgence in lust is extreme, your killings are unlawful, and your extravagance knows no bounds—these are the chariots that rend the body. Lust is the axe that destroys it. Killing invites retribution. Extravagance rots the heart. When desires accumulate, the spirit perishes; when lust gathers, life is severed. With a body as small as yours, harboring the thieves that destroy form, and a mind as narrow as a foot of timber, yet assailed by a hundred blades—how can you hope to shed the Three Corpses, preserve your body, and endure forever? It is like a wingless gull longing to soar over the celestial pond, or a morning mushroom hoping to enjoy the seasons. If you can cast aside these myriad disorders, purge your filth, and renew your mind; if you can guard your spirit in the Crimson Palace, seal the Palace of Lust and never open it, still extravagance in the chamber of silence, love all beings without harm, cultivate compassion and practice generosity, refine your qi, and cherish your essence—then can you not attain longevity? If you do not, it is like embracing a stone while fording a great river."

The Emperor knelt and received the Queen Mother’s admonitions, saying, "I, Che, am unworthy. Sunk in the mire of worldly customs, inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I have been shackled by worldly burdens. My governance has been perverse, my crimes as high as mountains. From this day forth, I shall heed your words."

The Queen Mother said, "The principles of nurturing life and the essentials of preserving the body—you surely know them already. The key lies in diligent practice without cease. My teacher, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, once imparted to me on the Terrace of Stern Clarity: 'Those who desire longevity must first set aside the self and seek within. Firmly guard the Three Ones and preserve the root of the spirit. Irrigate the profound valley with the nectar of flowering essence, and bathe the long-cleansed essence to enter the Gate of Heaven. The golden chamber winds within the central pass; the blue and white are distinct as they reach the Mud Pill. Nurture the fluids, seal the essence, and unite the body with the spirit. The Three Palaces are fully defended, and the Crimson Palace is preserved. The Yellow Court and the wu-ji have no source of leakage; the five viscera and the twelve channels are thoroughly pervaded. Exhale and inhale the six bowels, and the hun and po rejoice. Repel the hundred illnesses, ward off heat and cold, preserve the essence, and retain life—forever enduring. This is what is called 'breathing the Great Harmony and safeguarding the natural true essential Dao.' All who practice this will surely attain longevity. They may even command ghosts and spirits, wander the Five Peaks, though they cannot yet soar through the empty void. If you can do this, it is sufficient to transcend the world. Indeed, all who study immortality must begin here.'

As for the supreme divine medicines, the rare treasures of the Highest Emperor, the yin-born herbs of the earth, the wondrous grasses of layered clouds—these are the medicines of the immortals. Those who obtain the highest grade will age only after Heaven and Earth, for they are consumed by the Supreme Ones, not prized by middle immortals. Those who obtain the middle grade, if they consume them, will pass away only after Heaven and Earth—they are taken by the Heavenly Perfected, not attained by lower immortals. The next grade includes the Nine Elixirs, Golden Liquor, Purple Blossoms, Rainbow Essence, the Ninefold Refinement of the Great Clarity, the Five Clouds’ Nectar, Dark Frost, Crimson Snow, the Leaping Three Yellows, the White Incense of Yingzhou, the Flying Life of the Dark Continent, the Eight Stones and Thousand Mushrooms, the Nine Radiance of Awe and Joy, the Stone Gall of the Western Flow, the Green Coins of the Eastern Sea, the Remnant Grain of the High Mound, the Jade Field of Accumulated Stones, the Returning Elixir of the Great Void, stored in golden orchids, the Everlasting Crimson Grass, and the Flying Stalks of the Cloud Youths. Those who consume these will ascend to heaven in broad daylight—these are the medicines of the flying immortals, unknown to earthbound immortals."

The lesser medicines include the resin of pine and cypress, the essence of mountain ginger and galangal, chrysanthemum, alisma, wolfberry, fuling, sweet flag, asparagus, sesame, Solomon’s seal, *lingfei*, red planks, peach gum, *muying*, cimicifuga, dipsacus, *suixi*, and coptis. These are but a few examples of the lesser medicines—herbs are numerous, numbering in the thousands. Those who consume them may prolong their years. Though they cannot enjoy boundless longevity or ascend to the azure heavens, they may still restore their bodies to radiance, regain youthful complexion, command legions of spirits, and become earthbound immortals.

Those who seek the Dao must first rely on these as stepping stones to gradually attain greater heights. If one can master breath and refine essence, preserving and consolidating spirit and qi—where essence remains unspent, one endures forever; where qi abides, one never dies—then no expenditure on medicines or minerals is needed, nor any labor of seeking. This is drawn from within oneself. The common people use it daily yet remain unaware: this is the highest Dao, the essence of natural attainment.

Moreover, in the body of every person, Heaven bestows spirit, Earth bestows form, and the Dao bestows *xuan* (mysterious essence). When *xuan* abides, life persists; when *xuan* departs, death follows. All things—plants and trees alike—are the same. The body takes the Dao as its foundation; how can one not cultivate spirit and secure qi to preserve one’s form? When form and spirit are both whole, this is what the highest sages treasure. When form perishes and spirit scatters, is it not grievous? To lose this body is to be irrecoverable for ten thousand kalpas—cherish it well.

What I have spoken are the words taught to me by my master, the Primordial Heavenly King. The Jade Maiden Li Qingsun transcribed them and presented them to the Emperor. You must cultivate them diligently.

The Queen Mother of the West then commanded her chariot to depart, but the Emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and begged her to stay. The Queen Mother then ordered her attendants to summon the Supreme Primordial Lady to descend together to the Emperor’s palace. After a long while, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived, and celestial feasts were again prepared. Later, the Queen Mother instructed the Lady to bring forth the *Eightfold Scriptures of Assembly*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Talismans of the Five Thearchs and Six Jia Spirits*, and the *Numinous Flying Talismans*—twelve items in total. She said, "These scriptures are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas in Heaven. If they remain among humans, they may be bestowed upon a worthy adept after forty years."

The Queen Mother then commanded her attendant Song Lingbin to open a cloud-brocade satchel and retrieve a volume, which she handed to the Emperor. Rising and holding the book, she personally presented it to him. The Queen Mother intoned:

*"Heaven is high, Earth is low,
The Five Peaks stabilize form.
Primordial essence surges with* xuan*,*
*Great marshes hold dark essence.
Heaven revolves through nine paths,
Six harmonies bring eternal peace.
The Supreme Eight Assemblies
Achieve the flight of celestial beings.
True immortals keep faith,
Through this, the numinous is reached.
Leaked secrets invite ruin,
But treasured, they grant long life.
Heed this well—
I solemnly admonish you, Liu."*

After the incantation, the Emperor bowed and received the text. The Queen Mother said, "Those who first study the Dao and receive talismans should separately offer sacrifices to the spirits of rivers and mountains, purify themselves, and wear them. After forty years, if you wish to transmit what you have received, you may bestow it upon Dong Zhongjun and Li Shaojun. Moreover, as an emperor, you should diligently sacrifice to rivers and mountains to secure the state and present memorials to the true spirits to bless the common people."

Having spoken, she and the Supreme Primordial Lady commanded their chariots to depart. Their celestial retinue gathered, preparing to ascend to Heaven. The Queen Mother smiled and pointed at Dongfang Shuo, saying, "This is my neighbor’s mischievous child, ever fond of jesting. He has come thrice to steal my peaches. Once an immortal official of the Supreme, he was demoted to serve you for indulging in jade wine and disrupting the harmony of his post. He is no ordinary man."

Later, Emperor Wu failed to heed the Queen Mother’s warnings. Bewitched by wine and women, he waged endless wars—campaigning against Liaodong, attacking Chaoxian, opening the western and southern frontiers, constructing terraces and palaces, and exhausting the land. The realm grew resentful, and from then on, he lost the Dao. Though he later made three sacrifices at Huizhong, Linzi, and the Eastern Sea, the Queen Mother never descended again. The books he received were placed atop the Bailiang Terrace and consumed by heavenly fire. Li Shaojun departed by dissolving his form, Dongfang Shuo vanished in flight, and the witchcraft affair arose, leaving the Emperor filled with regret.

In the second year of the Yuanshi era, he passed away at the Wuzuo Palace and was buried at Maoling. Later, over fifty volumes of Daoist scriptures stored in Maoling, encased in golden caskets, appeared one day in the Baodu Mountains. A jade casket and jade staff also emerged in the Fufeng market, identical to those in Maoling—yet the casket and staff had appeared among men. This was a sign of *shijie*, the liberation through simulated death.

Furthermore, the Great Lord Mao Ying governed the southern Juru Mountains. On the *jiyou* day of the eighth month in the second year of the Yuanshou era, the Perfected of the Southern Peak, the Red Lord, the Lord of Xicheng, and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu descended together with the Queen Mother to Mao Ying’s chamber. Shortly after, the Heavenly Thearch of the Great August dispatched the Embroidered-Robe Envoy Ling Guangziqi to bestow upon Ying a divine seal and jade tablet. The Lord of the Grand Tenuity sent the Left Palace Attendant of the Three Heavens, Guan Xiutiao, to present Ying with an eight-dragon brocade carriage and a robe of purple feathers. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sent the Harmonious Dawn Gentleman Shi Shumen to grant Ying the *True Talisman of the Golden Tiger* and the *Flowing Gold Bell*. The Sage Lord of the Golden Watchtower commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Envoy of the Supreme Mystery, Wang Zhong, and Bao Qiu to bestow upon Ying the *Four-Season Swallow Embryo*, the *Flowing Brightness Divine Mushroom*.

After the four envoys had presented their gifts, they instructed Ying to consume the mushrooms, wear the seal, don the robe, straighten his cap, fasten the talismans, and grasp the bell as he stood. The envoys declared:

*"He who eats the* Four-Season Hidden Mushroom *becomes a True Minister.
He who eats the* Jade Mushroom of the Golden Watchtower *holds the office of Controller of Destinies.
He who eats the* Flowing Brightness Golden Bloom *holds the office of Controller of Prosperity.
He who eats the* Double-Flying Long Radiance *becomes a True Earl.
He who eats the* Cave Grass of Nocturnal Light *oversees the duties of the Left and Right Censors.
You have consumed them all—
Your lifespan shall equal Heaven and Earth,
Your rank shall be that of Supreme Perfected, Controller of Destinies, and Eastern Peak Minister,
Overseeing the immortals of Wu and Yue,
Governing the mountain sources of Jiangzuo."*

Having spoken, the envoys departed together.

The Five Thearchs each descended to his courtyard in chariots and regalia of their respective directions, conveying the Great Thearch’s mandate. They bestowed upon Ying a tablet of purple jade and a golden inscription of the Nine Bestowals, then enfeoffed him as Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Peak, Controller of Destinies, and Grand Primordial Perfected. When the rites were complete, they departed together.

The Queen Mother of the West and Ying’s master, Lord Wang of the Western City, prepared a celestial banquet for Ying, where they feasted and sang the *Hymn of Mystic Numinosity*. After the feast, the Queen Mother, accompanied by Lord Wang and Ying, visited Ying’s two younger brothers, imparting to each the essentials of the Dao.

The Queen Mother commanded the Lady of the Upper Prime to confer upon Mao Gu and Mao Zhong the four treasured scriptures: *Great Empyrean*, *Hidden Writ*, *Cinnabar Scenery*, and *Essence of the Dao*. The Queen Mother herself held the *Great Empyrean* and *Hidden Writ*, while the handmaiden Zhang Lingzi bore the covenant of mutual trust, presenting them to Ying, Gu, and Zhong. When the rites were complete, the Queen Mother of the West ascended to heaven and departed.

Later, the Lady of Purple Void, Madame Wang Huacun, purified herself in retreat upon Yangluo Mountain at the Terrace of Hidden Primordial. The Queen Mother of the West and the Sage Lord of the Golden Watchtower descended to the terrace, riding the Eightfold Radiance Palanquin together to the Palace of Pure Void. There, they transmitted the four-scroll *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity* to Huacun.

At that time, over thirty perfected beings were present, including the Three Prime Ladies bearing pearls of purple radiance, the Left Immortal Duke Shi Lucheng, the High Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Bo Yangaizi, the Perfected of the Western City Wang Fangping, the Perfected of the Great Void, the Red Pine Master of the Southern Marchmount, and the Perfected of Tongbai, Wang Ziqiao. Each sang the *Yang Hymn* and *Yin Hymn* of the Supreme Ultimate.

The Queen Mother sang:
*"I ride my Eightfold Radiance Palanquin,
Serene, I enter Jade Purity.
Dragon banners brush the empyrean,
Tiger legions command the crimson hosts.
Far-reaching at the Dark Ford’s verge,
Myriad currents never pause.
Once I depart, this meeting ends—
When kalpas end and heaven-earth collapse,
Seek the scene beyond the void,
Neither death nor birth remains.
Embody the Dao of spontaneity,
In silent contemplation merge with the Great Obscurity.
The Southern Marchmount nurtures the true stem,
Jade’s splendor gleams with luminous essence.
Those who bear their tasks without resistance,
With empty hearts receive the numinous.
A joyous gathering at the Crimson River’s bend,
Together we delight without end."*

When the Queen Mother finished her song, the Three Prime Ladies responded with their own. Then the Queen Mother, the Three Prime Ladies, the Purple Yang, the Left Immortal Duke, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Pure Void Lord Wang, and the Southern Marchmount’s Wei Huacun journeyed southeast together to Tiantai and Huo Mountain. Passing the Golden Altar of Juqu, they feasted with the Grand Primordial Perfected Mao in the Grotto-Heaven of Flourishing Yang. They left Huacun in the Jade Palace beneath the Grotto-Palace of Huo Mountain, while the assembled perfected followed the Queen Mother back to Turtle Terrace.

The Golden Mother of the Supreme Perfected instructs the myriad kinds, oversees the host of perfected, and holds the most exalted sacred rank, recording both the hidden and the manifest. When the Dark Grotto’s Xuan Gong received the Dao at court, or when Xie Ziranjing attended and ascended as an immortal, the *Dark Grotto* and *Ziran* traditions referred to her as their master—the Golden Mother, who is the Queen Mother.

The attested events in the *Mystic Canon* are largely as recorded here, though many remain uncompiled.

The Master of Broad Achievement of the Tang, Du Guangting, records:

**The Lady of the Supreme Prime**

The Lady of the Supreme Prime is a disciple of the Lord of the Dao. It is also said that since primordial antiquity she has attained the Dao and verified her immortal rank, governing the registers of the perfected and ranking below only the Golden Mother of Turtle Terrace. Wherever the Golden Mother descends, she often sends her handmaidens to announce the Lady’s presence as a guest and companion.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, who was devoted to the Way of divine transcendents, he performed rites and offered libations at famous mountains to seek numinous responses. On the seventh day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yuanfeng era (a *xinwei* year), after the second watch of the night, the Queen Mother of the West descended to the Han palace. The Emperor prostrated himself in welcome and stood in attendance for a long while. The Queen Mother summoned him to sit and set before him a celestial banquet. As she prepared to depart, the Emperor descended from his mat, kowtowed, and entreated her to stay, overcome with longing. The Queen Mother resumed her seat and commanded her handmaiden, Misty Incense, to invite the Lady of the Supreme Prime.

The Emperor did not know what perfected being the Lady was. She was called the Mother of Ninefold Radiance, who respectfully declined to appear, saying, “For over four thousand years, the affairs of heaven have wearied me, leaving my face marred. Liu Che is devoted to the Dao, and I have come to observe him. He is clear-sighted and seems capable of progress, yet his form is indolent and his spirit defiled. His brain-blood is turbid and excessive, his five viscera impure, his stomach and intestines hollow and empty. His bones lack vital fluids, his pulses float and reverse, his flesh is abundant but his essence scant. His youthful vitality has not shifted, and the Three Corpses stir chaos within him. His dark and white energies alternate in dominance. Though I should speak to him of the utmost Dao, I fear he is not destined for immortality. I have long been absent from the human realm, which is truly foul and putrid. Yet I may occasionally wander to gaze upon it and dispel my cares. Considering the host and guest seated together in melancholy, might the Lady come for a brief visit? If she would deign to descend, I shall wait for her.”

The Emperor saw the handmaiden descend from the hall and vanish for a moment. Soon after, another handmaiden arrived, sent by the Lady to reply. She was called A-Huan and bowed twice. The Emperor inquired after her well-being. She answered, “I dwell far beyond the Crimson River, burdened by official duties, which have dulled my complexion. For nearly five thousand years, I have longed for the radiance of the Queen Mother, my heart ever bound to her. Misty Incense has arrived bearing your summons to the humble abode of Liu Che. Upon receiving the command, I was about to set out when the Supreme Thearch of the Great Ultimate dispatched me to the Dark Continent to audit the celestial registers. I shall go briefly and return, and upon my return, I shall come to your seat. I pray you wait a little while.”

The Emperor then asked the Queen Mother, “May I know what perfected being the Lady of the Supreme Prime is?” Before the Queen Mother could answer, the Lady had already arrived. As she came, the sound of flutes and drums was heard in the clouds. Upon her arrival, her retinue of civil and military officials numbered over a thousand, all women of eighteen or nineteen, their forms and countenances luminous and transcendent. Most wore azure robes, their radiance outshining the sun—true spirit-officials.

The Lady appeared to be in her early twenties, her celestial bearing resplendent, her divine eyes surpassing all beauty. She wore a robe of crimson frost, its colors shifting like clouds, neither brocade nor embroidery, beyond naming. Her hair was styled in a triple-topped chignon, the rest cascading to her waist. She wore a crown of Ninefold Numinous Night-Light, a girdle of Six-Mountain Fire-Jade, a sash of phoenix-patterned numinous splendor, and at her waist hung a sword of flowing yellow essence. Ascending the hall, she bowed to the Queen Mother, who bade her sit.

The Queen Mother summoned the Emperor to sit facing north, and the Lady set forth a banquet of refined delicacies, similar to that of the Queen Mother. The Queen Mother admonished the Emperor, “This is the Mother of Primordial Essence, a deity of the highest honor. You should rise and bow to her.” The Emperor did so, inquired after her well-being, and returned to his seat. The Lady smiled and said, “The people of the Five Corruptions are addicted to wine and glory, craving flavors and lusts—this is their nature. Moreover, Che, as an emperor, is twice as distracted by splendor as ordinary men. Yet he has uprooted his desires in this realm of magnificence to seek the primordial—this shows true aspiration.”

The Queen Mother said, “Indeed, he has the heart for it.”

The Lady addressed the Emperor: “Do you love the Dao? I hear you have frequently summoned masters of esoteric arts, sacrificed at sacred mountains and numinous shrines, and offered libations to rivers and streams—you have been diligent. Yet diligence without attainment has its reasons. Your inborn nature is violent, your inborn nature is lewd, your inborn nature is extravagant, your inborn nature is cruel, your inborn nature is treacherous. These five traits are ever lodged within your constructive and defensive *qi*, within your five viscera. Even with the finest acupuncture and moxibustion, they would be difficult to cure.

Violence causes the dark *qi* to surge and assail the spirit, so the spirit is disturbed and the dark *qi* exhausted. Lewdness causes essence to leak and the hun-soul to weary, so essence is depleted and the hun-soul dissolved. Extravagance causes the true *qi* to depart and the po-soul to defile, so life flees and the numinous rots. Cruelty causes the loss of benevolence and assaults the eyes, so benevolence is lost and the eyes disordered. Treachery causes the heart to struggle and the mouth to parch, so there is inner strife and outer severance. These five are the saws and axes that sever the body, the hatchets that cleave life. Though you love longevity, you cannot escape these five calamities. Why harm your nature and weary yourself in vain? Yet through this, you may gain some small benefit to sustain yourself. If from now on you cast off these five evils and return to gentleness and goodness, illuminating your duty to examine the lowly, cherishing your duty to be compassionate and magnanimous, bestowing your duty to relieve the poor, aiding your duty to assist the weary, remembering your duty to honor the elderly, and resting your duty in loving your body—constantly performing hidden virtues to rescue those in peril—then day and night, diligently preserving your essence without emission, you may dispel lewdness and nourish your spirit. Forsake extravagance and dwell in frugality, practice fasting, regulate your diet, abstain from the five grains, eliminate foul odors, sound the Celestial Drum, drink Jade Nectar, bathe in the Flowery Pond, and strike the Golden Beam to cultivate these practices. There may yet be hope.

Now the Queen Mother, bearing the weight of the Heavenly Honored One’s command, has condescended to descend to the humble gate of a cicada’s shell, bending the numinous of the empyrean void to attend the altar of the fox’s cry. Moreover, the Queen Mother’s utmost sincerity and wondrous chanting of the mysterious sound—you must revere and heed her instructions, clearly cultivate what you have received. Within a hundred years, the Queen Mother will surely lead you to the precincts of the Dark Capital, welcome you amid the Kunlun’s heights, and appoint you to an immortal office to wander the ten directions. My words are true—strive on, my son!”

Should you fail in this, there shall be no more to say.

The Emperor rose from his seat and knelt in gratitude, saying: “Your servant, by nature fierce and stubborn, was born and raised amid chaos and filth. Like one facing a wall, I have had no means to enlightenment. Yet I cling to life and fear death, revering the numinous and honoring the gods. Now that I have received this teaching, it is as if Heaven itself has spoken. I shall take Your sagely command as the model for my conduct. Though I am but a lowly and unworthy servant, I may yet attain life—only I beg for Your compassion and protection, granting me the most profound mysteries.”

The Lady then bade the Emperor return to his seat. The Queen Mother said to the Lady: “Your words of sincerity are most urgent, yet they may cause one who has not yet understood to waver in resolve.”

The Lady replied: “If one is truly resolved upon the Dao, one would cast oneself before a starving tiger, forget the body in devotion, and tread through fire or peril—all for the sake of single-mindedness. There need be no worry. But if one lacks resolve, then such a person is one who doubts the truth, wavers in faith, and fears urgent counsel. The urgency of my words is meant only to strengthen their resolve. Since the Queen Mother has taken thought for him and come here, she must surely grant him the method of *shijie*.”

The Queen Mother said: “This child has long been diligent in heart, yet has not met a worthy teacher. Were he to abandon his true resolve, he would come to doubt that immortals exist in the world. Thus I have left my board palace and temporarily set aside the dust and filth, both to firm his embryonic resolve and to ensure that he does not waver on the path to the Dao. Today’s meeting has moved me to compassion. As for *shijie*, I am not at all reluctant to bestow it. Moreover, in three years’ time, I shall grant him half a dose of the completed elixir, one *Stone Elephant Powder*, and instruct him directly—he must not delay. Yet now, with treacherous slaves not yet pacified and the frontier still troubled, why should I rush to transcribe the scriptures of the Most High and send him hastening into the mountain forests? I must first inquire whether his devotion is steadfast and his resolve complete. If he should falter, I shall come again.”

The Queen Mother then patted the Emperor’s back and said: “You must heed the words of the Lady of the Highest Prime—only thus may you attain long life. Can you not strive with all diligence?”

The Emperor knelt and said: “I shall inscribe them upon golden tablets as the model for my conduct.”

The Emperor then noticed a scroll in the Queen Mother’s basket, encased in a purple brocade pouch. He asked: “Is this a divine scripture of the immortals? Might I know its title and be permitted to gaze upon it?”

The Queen Mother took it out and showed him, saying: “This is the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortals of Mount Qingcheng recently came to request it from me, and I am now passing through to deliver it to them. It was issued by the Most High of the Three Heavens, its text secret and its prohibitions weighty—how could one of your impure constitution be fit to wear it? For now, I shall give you the *Scripture of Numinous Radiance for Life*, which may open your spirit and strengthen your resolve.”

The Emperor bowed repeatedly, entreating without cease. The Queen Mother said: “In the first year of the *Qingxu* reign of the Supreme August One, the Most High Lord of the Dao of the Three Heavens descended to observe the Six Directions. He measured the length of the seas and rivers, examined the height of hills and mountains, set up the Pillar of Heaven and established it upon the earth’s veins, planted the Sacred Peaks and made them the bulwarks of the realm. He honored Kunlun as the abode of numinous immortals, exalted Penglai as the lodge of perfected beings, stationed the Fire Spirit at the source of utmost yin, and enthroned the Supreme Emperor in the precincts of Fusang. Thus, the mound of Fangzhang became the chamber of governance, the islands of the Canglang Sea the hall for nurturing the Nine Elders. Zuying, Xuanyan, Changyuan, Liusheng, Fenglin, and Juqu were each named as isles, all lying amid the vast expanse of the dark tides. Their waters flow both azure and black, their waves surge and stir the host of spirits. The assembled immortals and jade maidens dwell in the twilight depths, their names unfathomable yet their forms distinct. Beholding the patterns of mountains and springs, the winding of rivers and peaks, the circling of ridges and the stretching of ranges, their shapes coil and turn like written characters. Thus, their forms were named according to their likeness, their true designations carefully determined. Their images were inscribed in secret upon the Dark Terrace and issued as tokens of the numinous and true. All immortals wear them as one would a seal of transmission; Daoist adepts carry them when traversing mountains and rivers, and the hundred spirits and host of numina revere and draw near to them. Though you are not yet perfected, your repeated journeys to mountains and marshes in search of the Dao show that your resolve has not forgotten it. Delighted by your sincerity, I now grant this to you. You must treasure and guard it as you would serve a lord or father. Should you reveal or lose it to others, you will surely bring calamity upon yourself.”

The Lady said to the Emperor: “The Queen Mother has now bestowed upon you the script of the *Jade Summit* and the pearl-text of the *Purple Terrace*, granting you the *Scriptures of the Eight Assemblies* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*—truly the most precious and exalted treasures, the profound vision of the Supreme Emperor. Had you not been destined by fate to unite with the divine, you would never have beheld these texts. Though you now possess their forms and perceive their wondrous principles, without the talismans of the Five Emperors and the Six Jia, the left and right *Lingfei* charms of the Six Ding, the tally of the Jade Maidens who summon and guide the numinous, the *Celestial Radiance* writ of the Six Wu that calls forth spirits, the *Left Yi* text of *Hundun* and *Shumeng*, the *Right Geng* statutes of *Su Zhao* for capturing and slaying, the *Six Ren* and *Six Gui* arts of the *Hidden Earth Eight Techniques*, the *Nine Red Spotted Talismans* of *Bing* and *Ding* for entering fire, the methods of the *Six Xin* for entering metal and summoning the *Yellow Water* and *Moon Essence*, the *Six Ji* techniques of *Stone Essence* and *Golden Radiance* for concealing light and transforming form, the *Eight Endowments* and *Ten Decisions* of *Zi*, *Wu*, *Mao*, and *You*, the *Six Numinous Dignities*, the *Earthly True* and *Plain White* formulas of *Chou*, *Chen*, *Wei*, and *Xu* for the *Long Life Purple Writ*, the *Three-Five Sequential Movements*, and the *Purple Fire* and *Inner Vision* of *Yin*, *Si*, *Shen*, and *Hai*—without these twelve arts, how could you summon the mountain spirits, call forth the earth gods, gather the myriad essences, drive away the hundred demons, command tigers and leopards, or employ dragons? What you have now is but one part—you have yet to see the rest.”

The Emperor rose from his seat and bowed, saying: “Your servant, a man of the dust and filth of the lower world, has not known the purity of the true. Today, I have heard the Dao—this is the encounter of a lifetime. Now that the Sagely Mother has deigned to grant me the *True Forms* to cultivate and transcend the world, and the Lady has instructed me in the arts of the Six Jia, Six Ding, and Six Wu to summon the numinous, I have received boundless enlightenment and benefit. I can only beg for further instruction to relieve my hunger and thirst, that this withered tree may be moistened by the clouds and sun, and this scorched grass blessed by the sweet rain. I dare not say more.”

The Emperor continued his entreaties without cease. The Queen Mother then said to the Lady: “The *True Forms* and precious texts are treasured by the numinous officials. This child has sought them relentlessly, swearing to obtain them at all costs. Thus, I have relaxed the prohibitions and shall grant them to him. Yet the arts of the Five Emperors and Six Jia for approaching the true and summoning the divine are subtle and distant—one must be utterly pure and sincere, for they are hardly suited to those of impure or common nature. Since I have now bestowed the *True Forms* upon him, Lady, you must instruct him further.”

“Recalling now, I once ascended the dark ridges of Feather Wilds with you, Lady, and the Radiant-Truth Mountain, where the Prince and the Youth came to request the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme* from me. I then declared that the *Three-Nine Secret Words* must not be divulged among the middle immortals, and you, Lady, also spoke of guarding them, aiding the Prince and Youth in their attainment.

Since I could hardly refuse his earnest plea and would not cling to them selfishly, today’s matter bears a likeness. Later, on Vermilion Mound, I tasted the spirit-melons—most fine—and though that memory is not distant, seven thousand years have already passed.

You have already revealed to him the twelve titles of the scrolls; surely you must now craft them into completion. Why then do you allow the master to bow and beg, to the point of drawing blood? The Lady replied: Had I not been so reluctant before, I would not have withheld them. These were issued by the *True Person of the Multitudinous Writ of the Great Void*, Red Youth, and their transmission has ever distinguished between male and female.

Moreover, they should be bestowed only upon those who have attained the Dao. I fear that Liu Che’s mediocre talent is unfit for their use.”

The Queen Mother’s countenance grew stern, and she said: “Heaven’s prohibitions against leakage violate the luminous statutes. Transmission must be to the right person; bestowal, to one who knows the true. Lady, why have you spoken of the *Numinous Flight*’s titles to one of such low talent? To speak idly is to leak; to speak without transmitting is to obstruct the celestial Dao. Is this prohibition not weightier than mere transmission? The Three Palaces’ Enforcers will surely indict you for this careless disclosure.

My *True Forms of the Five Peaks* were issued by the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign. Their writ is wondrous and precious, the token of celestial immortals—how could they be bestowed upon Liu Che? Yet his tireless heart has repeatedly entreated the rivers and mountains; he diligently observes purification rites to seek the response of transcendence. His aspiration is to cross the world, and as he has not encountered an enlightened master, we have softened our stance.

As for the safeguards of teaching transcendence, we no longer restrict or withhold transmission. Lady, do you alone possess the methods to summon the numinous? My reason for now bestowing the *True Forms* upon Liu Che is not that I believe he will necessarily attain the Dao, but that his spirit may find verification, his quest for transcendence may be stirred without confusion, and he may guide others toward transformation.

I also wish to let the careless know that such numinous and true matters exist between heaven and earth, enough to refute the madmen who disbelieve. Such is my intent. Yet his nature is lewd and violent, his eyes not red—how could he become a true immortal, drifting among the clouds? If he practices diligently, he may at best approach deathlessness.

The luminous statutes say: It is not attaining long life that is difficult, but hearing the Dao. It is not hearing the Dao that is difficult, but practicing it. It is not practicing it that is difficult, but persisting to the end. A skilled craftsman can give others the compass and square, but cannot make them skillful. What then is there to hide?”

The Lady said: “I humbly receive your command. Yet in the past, I received the *Numinous Writ* from the *Lord of the Inverted Light* and the *Eternal Master*, with the stipulation that it be transmitted once every four thousand years—women to women, men to men. The Supreme’s statutes and prohibitions are inscribed upon the *Luminous Life Talisman*.

Since I began transmitting it, I have passed it to sixty-eight worthy women, including the Great Maiden Bao Lan. Women must not transmit it to men. Recently, I saw the *Green Youth of Mount Fu Guang* receive the *Six Jia Numinous Flight* from the *Central Lord of the Grand Tenuity*—twelve matters identical to what I received. The Green Youth is my disciple, and I have not heard of him transmitting the *Six Jia* to anyone else. He is a male official, and now I shall urgently summon him to bestow it upon Liu Che.

My earlier disclosure of the titles was to pity his earnestness and strengthen his resolve. Now, I shall seek more broadly, and in time grant it to him, transmitting man to man in accordance with the statutes, so that through diligence he may obtain it and know the preciousness of celestial perfection. This is not mere obstinate obstruction of the celestial Dao.”

The Queen Mother smiled and said: “Can this be forgiven?”

The Lady then commanded her attendant, Ji Luorong, to hasten to Mount Fu Guang and summon the Green Youth to bring forth the twelve methods of the *Left and Right Six Jia Numinous Flight* for summoning the divine, to be bestowed upon Liu Che. Presently, the attendant returned, bearing an eight-colored jade box with phoenix-script reports, and presented the *Six Jia* texts, saying:

“Your disciple, A Chang, was recently on a mission to the Crimson River to inspect the affairs of the *Seven Source Lords of the Southern Truth* and the myriad dragons and fierce beasts. Passing by, I received your summons to the home of Liu Che. I did not expect the august celestial numen to descend into this foul and turbid realm. I wonder how your journey has been?

Attendant Ji Luorong arrived and said that you wished to obtain the twelve matters of the *Golden Writ Secret Scripts of the Six Jia Numinous Flight*, the *Left and Right Strategies of Essence*, to bestow upon Liu Che. I have sealed one copy to deliver in trust. Yet though Liu Che has the heart, he is truly not of immortal talent. How could such a transmission be leaked to a walking corpse?

Recently, at the Emperor’s court, I have heard many speak of him: mountain spirits weep in the thickets, lonely souls wail in the desolate wilds. Armies are raised, and clans rewarded for merit; reckless wars exhaust the people, leaving white bones scattered. He oppresses and disturbs the black-haired folk, indulging in cruelty and excess. His crimes are already manifest to the Supreme; his resentment is seen in the darkening heavens. With such clamorous words and dark omens, he will surely not transcend the world.

Yet since you have moved to act, I dare not disobey.”

The Queen Mother smiled and said: “Many speak thus of this child, but the Emperor need not be reproached.”

Those who cherish the Dao and yearn for transcendence purify their sincerity, focus their intent, fast, and reflect on their transgressions—each such act erases a hundred faults. Those who restrain the self, return to goodness, revere the true spirits, preserve authenticity, and guard unity—each month of such practice erases a thousand faults. Che has pondered the Dao for years and fasted diligently; he has prayed to renowned mountains, vowing to seek liberation. Weighing his merits against his faults, they nearly balance. Yet from this day forward, he must cultivate sincerity with diligence and heed the words of the Lady of Primordial Yang. He must no longer indulge in extravagance, cruelty, or oppression, lest the multitudes suffer and perish, lest the grievances of wronged souls and starving ghosts—those who dig through graves and lie in pools of blood—drown out the words of merit and reward.

The Lady then rose from her seat, holding a response inscribed on eight-colored jade with phoenix-script patterns. Facing the heavens and addressing the Emperor, she intoned:

*"The Nine Heavens vast and boundless,
The Supreme radiates numinous light.
Divine insight pierces the subtle,
Pure emptiness shines bright and clear.
Pure emptiness is wondrous,
Guarding the dark brings life.
Utmost devotion to the Dao attains it,
Stillness evokes the true and complete.
To toil the spirit and humble the form,
To calm the essence and flourish the years—
I grant Che the* Lingfei *script,
Along with these Six Dings,
Summoning spirits left and right,
Heavenly radiance refines the essence.
With these, one may walk the void,
Or conceal the form.
Long life and enduring vision,
Restoring youth and preserving vitality.
I was granted a lifespan of forty thousand years,
Che is granted forty.
Should he violate or leak these teachings,
Disaster will topple his clan.
But if he reveres the celestial truth,
He will avoid the depths of darkness.
Beware calamity, I warn you, Liu Che."*

*"Your master is the Controller of the Azure Perfected Youth, the Central Yellow Lord of the Supreme Dao, and a disciple admitted to the chamber of the Ten Heavenly Kings of the Primordial Beginning. His surname is Yan, given name Lingyang, and courtesy name Bihua. Though his form bears the appearance of an infant, his immortal title is the Azure Perfected Youth. His vessel is luminous jade, illuminating all; his sagacity encompasses ten thousand transformations. His dark mirror surveys the hidden, his talent marks him as a true prodigy. Roaming the vast and boundless, he propels the primal movement. Dwelling in the Mystic Orchard, he administers the duties of transcendence. If you preserve your master’s teachings, your wishes shall be fulfilled. If you neglect what is granted, your life will surely collapse."*

Having spoken, the Lady pointed with her hand to each of the ritual implements and texts she bestowed, demonstrating them to the Emperor. When all twelve matters were completed, she further instructed him:

*"The Five Emperors are the true essences of the cardinal directions. The Six Jias are the numinous conduits of the six positions. To honor and wear them is to attain longevity. This script was sealed by the Supreme Lord in the Terrace of Mystic Radiance—treasure and guard it well."*

The Queen Mother added:

*"This was composed by the Supreme of the Three Heavens and concealed in the Terrace of Purple Mound, hidden within the chamber of the numinous altar. It was sealed in a casket of radiant jade, bound with silk of orchid fibers, tied with cords of northern gauze, and stamped with the seal of the Supreme Emperor. It is transmitted once every forty years to a single recipient. If no suitable person is found, two may receive it at once after eighty years. Those who attain the Dao transmit it once every four hundred years; those who attain transcendence, once every four thousand years; those who attain authenticity, once every forty thousand years; and those who ascend to the Supreme, once every four hundred thousand years. To transmit to an unworthy recipient is to leak the celestial Dao; to withhold from a worthy one is to obscure the celestial treasure. To transmit recklessly beyond the limit is to trifle with the celestial elders; to receive without reverence is to slight the celestial splendor. Leaking, obscuring, trifling, and slighting—these four are the blades and axes that bring death, the chariots that extend calamity. Those who leak shall die on the road, their bodies subjected to earthly punishment and torn asunder. Those who obscure shall be struck blind and deaf in the next life, their two destinies withering in vain before an untimely end. Those who trifle shall bring misfortune upon their parents and be summoned to the Dark Capital to receive punishment. Those who slight shall meet a violent end and fall into evil, their future lives afflicted with abandonment and illness."*

All these are the statutes and prohibitions of the Dao, thus serving as mutual warnings—one cannot but be cautious.

The Queen Mother of the West thereupon bestowed upon the Emperor the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The Emperor bowed and received them in full. The Lady herself plucked the strings of her *yunlin* zither and sang the *Step of the Mysterious* melody. The Queen Mother commanded her attendant, Tian Sifei, to respond in song. When the singing concluded, she revealed to the Emperor the names of his attendants, as well as the names of their caps, sashes, and the objects they held—so that these might be known and recorded.

At dawn, the Queen Mother and the Lady of the Upper Prime departed together, riding in dragon-and-tiger chariots with their celestial retinue, the music as when they first arrived. Clouds billowed thickly, transforming entirely into fragrant mist as they journeyed southwest, lingering long before vanishing.

Having beheld the Queen Mother and the Lady, the Emperor came to believe in the existence of divine transcendents in the world. Yet, lacking diligent cultivation, he would later attain only *shijie* and depart, unable to ascend to heaven. The Queen Mother, the Lady, and the Azure Perfected Youth all declared that the Emperor lacked the talent for immortality—this was indeed the profound scrutiny of the mysterious.

Nevertheless, he partook of the divine peaches, sacred fruits, celestial delicacies, and immortal wine. His sincere pursuit of the Dao had evoked a response, for his bones were no mere mortal’s. Otherwise, how could the relics of Maoling have appeared among men? This was but a fleeting display of divine transformation, a sign that the Way of transcendence cannot be falsified.

Later, in the fourth year of *Dijie* of Emperor Xiaoxuan’s reign (the year *yimao*), Mao Ying of Xianyang, styled Shushen, received the mandate of the Nine Bestowals of Yellow Gold and was appointed Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, True Lord of Life and Destiny, and Perfected of the Great Prime. At that time, the Five Thearchs completed the conferral of their registers and each ascended to heaven.

The Master of Mao Ying, the Perfected Sovereign Wang, along with the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady, descended upon Mount Jurong’s Golden Altar within the Celestial Palace of Huayang to feast Mao Ying. At that time, Mao Ying’s middle brother, Mao Gu, styled Jiwei, and his youngest brother, Mao Zhong, styled Sihe, were also present. The Queen Mother and Sovereign Wang transmitted to them the *Numinous Secrets* and bestowed upon them the purple-silk registers of mandate. Gu was appointed Lord of the Fixed Record, and Zhong was appointed Lord of Life Preservation, both attending the assembly of the Perfected.

Sovereign Wang addressed the two Lords, saying: "The Lady is the Mother of the Three Celestial Thearchs, the exalted sovereign of the Upper Prime, and overseer of the registers of the jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions. You may present yourselves before the two Lords, descend from your mats, and bow twice to beseech the essentials of longevity."

Moved by their diligent devotion, the Lady commanded her attendant, Song Pifei, to bring forth a purple brocade pouch and open the green-gold clasp. She bestowed upon the two Lords four scriptures: the *Scripture of the Flowing Pearl of the Three Primes*, the *Scripture of the Dao’s Essence in Cinnabar Scenery*, the *Scripture of the Eight Arts of Concealment*, and the *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate’s Recorded Scenery*.

The Queen Mother then instructed her attendant, Li Fangming, to produce a cinnabar-jade case and unfasten its cloud-pearl clasp. She presented the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*, the *Scripture of the Concealed Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, and the *Inner Writ of the Two Sceneries of Cavernous Flight* to the Lord of Life and Destiny. After bestowing the texts, the Queen Mother and the Lady took their leave, ascending to the Great Void with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders.

**The Illustrious Lady Li of the Eastern Palace of the Square Terrace**
The Illustrious Lady Li of the Eastern Palace of the Square Terrace was the daughter of Li Qingbin, the Dao Lord of the Northern Prime of the Central Mystery, and the younger sister of Li Lingfei, the Jade Lad of the Grand Protector. During the Shang dynasty, she attained the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, receiving the scriptures and being appointed Illustrious Lady of the Eastern Palace. She presides over the Thirteenth Vermilion Pavilion of the Square Terrace.

On the night of the twenty-second day of the eighth month in the third year of *Xingning* of Emperor Ai of the Eastern Jin (the year *yichou*), she descended to the home of the Perfected Yang Xi. The Lady wore a purple brocade robe, bore the talisman of the Divine Tiger, and held a flowing-gold bell. She appeared to be around thirteen or fourteen years old, accompanied by two attendants of twenty-one or twenty-two. The attendants, named Yin Hui, were clad in azure silk, each carrying a white jade box bound with azure cords. The boxes were inscribed: *Supreme Thearch’s Chapters* and *Supreme Jade Writ*.

The Lady wore a sash of azure-jade hue, resembling the insignia pouches of mortals. The concealed chapters were about five *zhang* in length and three or four *chi* in width. She descended alongside the Lady of the Upper Prime, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, the Lady of the Right Radiance, and other Perfected Ones. Before departing, she composed a poem:

A cloud-pond girds the heavens’ frame,
Seven blacks gleam with divine might.
Jade portals open at dawn’s cry,
Nine tones within the crimson hinge?
Purple haze rises at the vermilion gate,
Fragrant mist stirs the emerald window.

Four chariots with dancing tiger banners,
Azure discs cast into the dark void.
Canopies of splendor follow clouds in descent,
Falling phoenix reins the six dragons.
Urging the light across the slopes of the Five Peaks,
The Three Pristine Ones meet the Lord’s chamber.
Yet foul and turbid qi assails my breast,
Myriad impurities defile my heart.
Stench pollutes the spirit,
Clamor and dust clash with virtue.
Bright jade all shines resplendent—
Why alone does my body thrive in excess?
Had I raised my hands in farewell sooner,
Worms would not have bred upon the earth.
Before departing, she sang once more:
Let not the heart grow disordered,
Let not the spirit indulge in toil.
The Dao is easy, yet unheeded;
Calamity is grave, yet unopposed.
Eternal loss of the true self—
Thus I depart, forsaking you.
Will you return to the Xu household?
I shall come again—only strive diligently.

On the third day of the ninth month that year, she descended once more and sang:
Drinking freely, I observe the throng’s wisdom,
Swiftly I revere the fourfold cycle.
Unknowing of the cause,
Yet truly, the heart awaits its wanderings.
Those met are all joyous,
Those unmet bring no sorrow.
Soaring shadows in the dark void,
Two encounters naturally align.
On the first night of the twelfth month, she chanted a verse to Xu YuFu:
I soar to the lofty morning terrace,
Reining the dark frontier’s edge.
My hand grasps the Purple Sovereign’s sleeve,
Swiftly the Eight Winds drive me on.
Jade splendor wings the emerald curtains,
Azure parasols fan the verdant willows.
The crown’s splendor gleams on towering peaks,
Pendants tinkle with moonlit pearls.
Yet plunging into the world’s dust,
I block my nose to flee the path.
Foul stench withers my darkness,
A hundred ills vex my heart’s core.
Why not rise with a sigh,
Treading the Great Void with light steps?

**The Lady of the Three Primes**
The Lady of the Three Primes, surnamed Feng, named Shuang Lizhu, is a high Perfected One of the Supreme Clarity. She also oversees covenants, the first ascension, and the attainment of the Dao, destined to become a Perfected Person and Primordial Lord.

In the fifth year of Yonghe during the reign of Emperor Mu of Jin (the *jiyou* year), the Lady, together with the Queen Mother of the West, the Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, the Primordial Lord of the Nine Effulgences, the Left Immortal Duke of Purple Yang, Shi Lu Cheng, the High Immortal Earl of the Supreme Ultimate, the Lads of Extended Canopy, Wang Fangping the King of Total Perfection of the Western City, the Perfected Person of the Great Void, Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount, the Perfected Person of Paulownia Summit, and the Right Assistant King Wang Ziqiao, gathered in the Crimson Chamber of the Lesser Existence’s Pure Void Upper Palace. There, they feasted the Primordial Lord of Purple Void of the Southern Marchmount, Lady Wei Huacun, with divine viands and celestial music. The Nine Numinous Ones harmonized with the eight tones’ brilliance. The Queen Mother rose to dance, beating time as she sang. When the song ended, the Lady herself plucked the *yun’ao* zither and responded, singing:
From Jade Clarity beyond the Nine Heavens,
Divine bonds soar beyond the flying rosy clouds.
The cloud terrace gleams in towering splendor,
The numinous hall flourishes in lush seclusion.
Five clouds rise with emerald splendor,
Eight winds fan the verdant darkness.

Gazing upward, they chanted verses to dissolve demonic illusions;
Bending low, they studied wisdom and insight.
The myriad Perfected revealed numinous visions,
Singing in anticipation of the Crimson Chamber’s assembly.
A peerless child of virtuous resonance emerged,
His spirit’s radiance sweeping away all stagnation.
The Celestial Marchmount soared in midair construction,
Its cloud terraces profound in deep seclusion.
Roaming the seas, he awakened to the well’s vow;
Treading the true, he perceived the world’s defilement.
Dancing, he offered feasts to the layered voids;
The herb and fish naturally fell away.
He returned to the Great Stambha,
Forever parting from the ephemeral world of morning’s birth.

When the song ended, the assembled Perfected each intoned verses of Yang Songs and Yin Songs, expounding the principles of inner cultivation and realization of the Dao. Some extolled the beauty of accumulated merit and layered practice; others chanted the essentials of golden liquid and frost’s splendor. These differed slightly from the Yang Songs of the Cavernous Divine, for they were the subtle words of the Celestial Perfected.

**The Lady of the Southern Culmen, Royal Consort**

The Lady of the Southern Culmen, Royal Consort, was the Queen Mother’s fourth daughter, named Lin and styled Rongzhen. She was also called the Purple Prime Lady or the Lady of the Southern Culmen. She governed the Great Cinnabar Palace and received scriptures to serve as the Supreme Lord of the Golden Watchtower’s Upper Protector of Life and Destiny.

During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, she descended into the stone chamber of Yangluo Mountain, where she transmitted to the Pure Void Perfected, the Lesser Existence’s Celestial King Wang Bao (styled Zideng), thirty-one fascicles of scriptures, including the *Supreme Treasure Writ*. The Lady appeared to be around sixteen or seventeen years old, clad in a brocade robe and azure feathered skirt, with a tiger-script talisman at her left waist and a spirit-summoning girdle at her right. Her countenance was truly upright, her celestial bearing serene and luminous. She rode a feather-canopied chariot drawn by nine dragons, attended by nine thousand female riders.

She dwelled in the Vermilion Yang Cinnabar Sea of Changli Mountain, where she instructed those destined to become Perfected. In the third year of the Xingning era of the Jin (Yichou), she descended to the home of the Perfected Yang Xi, gathering with the Eight Perfected. There, she chanted and transmitted to Xi:

I rein the whirlwind to fan the Great Void,
Eight luminaries soar through the lofty clarity.
Gazing upward, I float beyond the Purple Dawn;
Looking down, I behold the utter end of the Falling River.
The mysterious heart inquires in empty sameness,
Above and below, no drifting or halting.
In the no-dependency of the two bounds,
With dependency, there is nothing to seek.
Embodying non-being, one can die;
Embodying being, one preserves life.
The Eastern Guest joins the lofty chant—
What dispute is there between the two dependencies?

The Eastern Guest was the Great Mao Lord, Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount.

She also said:
I command the jade brocade carriage,
Reining the dancing steeds in upward contemplation.
At dawn, I roam the Vermilion Fire Palace;
At dusk, I feast by the Radiant Night Pool.
Floating scenes brush the tips of rosy clouds,
Eight dragons arrayed in uneven ranks.
I wander without dependency,
Yet those with dependency follow in my wake.
In the high assembly, the fair ones slumber—
The two dependencies vie in right and wrong.
Being and non-being are not fixed;
Each dependency returns to its own.

On the twenty-third day of the sixth month of that year, she again chanted and transmitted to Lord Yang:

Forests tremble like whiskers stirred by feeling,
Clouds thicken awaiting the dragon’s song.
Mysterious numbers seek one another,
Striking nodes, all resound with sound.
The Flying Plow emerges from Western Florescence,
Reining the team, they suddenly come to seek.
The eight distances hold no lack of joy—
Together we chant, the principle naturally revered.
Grieving within these Four Nets,
A hundred transformations ever in the heart.
Together we roam the Northern Frigid Terrace,
Where the divine wind unfurls your lapels.

After the Lady had transmitted the Treasure Scriptures to Wang Zideng, she told him: “My Dao soars through the empty void with the Eight Luminaries of the Upper Clarity. Diligently cultivate it—I do not deceive you.”

Thereupon, the King of Western City escorted Zideng to the north to behold the Mysterious Continent, where they paid homage to the Supreme Venerable and the Twenty-Nine Perfected Lords of the Immortal Dao. The Dao Lord was the Supreme Lord’s son, Leboli. The Dao Lord commanded the handmaidens Fan Yunhua, Zhao Junzhu, and Wang Baotai to open the jade coffer of green luxuriance and present two fascicles—the *Hidden Writ of the Upper Clarity* and the *Dragon Script of the Eight Numinous Perfected*—to Zideng. She also bestowed upon him two *sheng* of cloud-azure yang-water and morning-flying cinnabar fat. Zideng bowed in receipt and returned to the Western City Palace, where he cultivated with precision for nine years. Daily, he traversed three thousand *li* and could perceive beyond ten thousand *li*. Seated or standing, he could vanish at will, commanding legions of spirits.

He rode the Flying Terrace’s chariot, roaming to observe the world below. He journeyed east to the Palace of the Dawn’s Radiance and Mount Guang Sang, where he paid homage to the Supreme Emperor and received the *Vermilion Phoenix’s Crimson Writ*. Crossing south over the Cinnabar Sea of Changli Mountain, he paid court to the Lady of the Southern Culmen, the Purple Prime Lady, and received again the *Great Cinnabar Record Writ*. He then visited the Lad of the Crimson Terrace to receive the cloud-jade frost of watery frost.

The Lady said: “Were my words of old false?” Zideng bowed his head in gratitude and thanks.

Crossing west over the vast sea of Yuqiu’s Sinking Feather Spring, he ascended Mount Linong and paid homage to the Three Sovereigns’ Dao Lord, the Purple Canopy Lady of Flourishing Dawn, receiving the *Jade Dao’s Green Script of the Great Perfected’s Hidden Writ*. Journeying north to the Dark and Supple Mysterious Sea, he ascended Mount Guangye, where he encountered the Supreme Void Emperor, the Great Dao Lord, and the Six Subtle Primordial Lords. They bestowed upon him the Absolute Mystery’s Golden Seal and the Crimson Harmony’s Cloud Mushroom. Zideng bowed and donned them, then ascended the Central Marchmount’s Tortoise Terrace and Kunlun Ridge to pay court to the Grand Perfected Golden Mother. There, he was enfeoffed as the Great Simplicity’s Pure Void Perfected, presiding as the Lesser Existence’s Celestial King, Left Protector and Upper Duke of the Three Primes and Four Offices. He governed the grotto palaces’ Three Caverns’ treasure texts and entered the Supreme Clarity to receive affairs from the Grand Ultimate. Thus, he became the Lady’s disciple.

*Records of the Walled City’s Assembled Transcendents, Fascicle Three*

Du Guangting of the Tang, Master of Broad Achievement, *Collected [Works]*

**The Lady of Cloud Radiance**

The Lady of Cloud Radiance was the twenty-third daughter of the Queen Mother and the younger sister of the Lady of Great Perfection, Royal Consort Wang. Her name was Yaoji, and she had received the Dao of the Whirling Wind’s Primal Fusion and the Ten Thousand Sceneries’ Spirit-Refinement and Flying Transformation. Once, she journeyed to the Eastern Sea and, on her return, passed above the Yangzi River. There stood Mount Wu, its peaks and crags towering, its forests and ravines secluded and lovely. A massive stone, flat and broad enough to serve as an altar, held her there for a long while.

At that time, Great Yu was controlling the waters and had halted at the foot of the mountain. Suddenly, a great wind arose, shaking cliffs and valleys, its force uncontrollable. Yu encountered the Lady and bowed, seeking her aid. She promptly ordered her attendants to present Yu with the *Book of Summoning the Hundred Spirits*. She then commanded her divine ministers—Kuangzhang, Yuyu, Huangmo, Dayi, Gengchen, and Tonglü—to assist Yu in cutting through stone, dredging waves, blocking obstructions, and guiding the flow of the waters. Yu bowed in gratitude.

Yu once visited her atop the summit of Chongsu. In the blink of an eye, she transformed into stone; then, in an instant, she soared and scattered into wispy clouds, coalescing into evening rain. At times, she became a roaming dragon; at others, a soaring crane. Her thousand forms and ten thousand appearances were beyond perception—one could not discern her constant nature. Yu suspected her of being a cunning and monstrous fraud, no true transcendent.

He asked Tonglü about this. Tonglü replied: "The root of Heaven and Earth is the Dao; the function of the Dao is enacted by the sage. The ranks of sages include perfected ones and immortals. Some, endowed with qi, attain perfection without cultivation and thereby achieve the Dao—such are the Lord of the Wood and the Queen Mother. They are the ancestors of the Two Qi, the origin of yin and yang, the sovereigns of the immortals and perfected, the primordial source of creation.

The Lady of Cloud Radiance is the daughter of the Queen Mother. Formerly, she studied under the Three Primes’ Dao Lord and received the precious scriptures of Supreme Clarity. She was invested with these texts beneath the Purple Clarity’s gate-towers and became the Lady of the Cloud Radiance Upper Palace, presiding over the instruction of youthful perfected ones. Her governance is based at the Terrace of the King’s Reflection. Her manifestations and transformations are her constant nature.

This is also because she, having congealed the Dark to attain perfection, embodies the Dao itself—not a form born of womb or endowed by transformation, but the qi of the Western Florescence’s Lesser Yin. Moreover, qi pervades Heaven and Earth, animating and nourishing all things. It encompasses creation in its vastness and penetrates the finest hair in its subtlety. In humans, it becomes human; in things, it becomes things. How could it be limited to clouds and rain, dragons and cranes, soaring geese and flying phoenixes?

Yu was convinced and visited her again. Suddenly, he beheld towers of cloud and jade, palaces of jasper and towers of coral rising majestically to the heavens. Unnamable and unrecognizable spirit officials stood guard, while lions held the gates, celestial horses opened the paths, and the Eight Mighty Ones—poison dragons and lightning beasts—attended her chariot. The Lady sat in repose upon her jasper terrace. Yu prostrated himself and sought her instruction.

She summoned Yu to sit and said: "The sagely artisan, at the dawn of creation, split the Great Primal Unity’s uncarved block into the myriad forms. From the vast storehouse of the One, it scattered into boundless things. Thus, the Three Luminaries were set in motion to establish the sundial’s shadow; the Nine Provinces were demarcated to regulate states and domains. Clepsydrae were carved to divide day and night; cold and heat were ordered to complete the year’s reckoning. The trigrams *dui* and *li* were used to align the four directions; mountains and rivers distinguished peril from ease. Walls and moats gathered the people and their defenses; weapons protected the multitudes. Chariots and robes marked rank and nobility; grains and millets prepared for famine and scarcity. All these systems above take their pattern from the stars and constellations and model themselves on the divine perfected; below, they nourish the realm of form.

Thus, the sun and moon have their obscurity and brightness; life and death follow cold and heat. Thunder and lightning have their times of emergence and retreat; wind and rain have their constants of motion and stillness. Pure yang floats above while turbid qi flows below. The cycles of rise and fall, order and chaos; the natures of the wise and foolish, good and evil; the qi of hardness and softness; the fates of long life and early death; the stations of nobility and baseness, high and low; the responses of fortune and misfortune; the appointed times of success and failure—all these are endowed by the Dao, suspended from Heaven, and established as systems by the sage.

Nature arises from Heaven, but destiny is completed by humans. What is established is Heaven’s; what is enacted is the Dao’s. Where the Dao abides, there is being; where the Dao departs, there is nothing. Without the Dao, things cannot endure. Without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained.

The Dark Elder said: *Attain utmost emptiness; maintain sincere stillness. The myriad things will naturally return.* To return is to revert to the Dao and abide in constancy. The function of the Dao is to transform in myriad ways without losing its oneness. Thus, Heaven participates in the Threefold Mystery; Earth participates in the Primal Yellow; humans participate in virtue and power. Beyond these, what single thing does not rest in the Dao?

The essentials of longevity are these: Heaven treasures its mystery; Earth preserves its things; humans nurture their qi. This is how wholeness is maintained. *My life is in my hands, not subject to Heaven’s slaying or ghosts’ harm. It is the loss of the Dao that brings self-destruction.* Be steadfast! Be diligent! Your merit has extended to things; your toil has reached the people. Your goodness has moved Heaven, yet you have not yet heard the essentials of the supreme Dao.

Formerly, at the Purple Clarity’s gate-towers, I received the precious texts and diligently practiced them. My teacher, the Three Primes’ Dao Lord, said: *The* Inner Scripture of the Supreme Perfected *is treasured by the Celestial Perfected. Sealed in a golden casket and worn at the Great Tenuity, it ascends to the cloudy heights. The Divine Martial embraces the gate-towers; robes are shaken in the jasper chambers; one roams and feasts in the rare groves. The Eternal Summoner of Immortals, gazing down from the Western White Mountain upon the vast sky, drifts upon the Celestial Ford. Riding clouds and driving dragons, one visits these famous mountains. Then, perfected ones approach the chambers, and the myriad spirits attend. Mountain spirits receive and escort. In motion, one has the Eight Sceneries’ Jade Chariot; in stillness, one dwells in the Golden Hall—also called the* Supreme Jade Girdle and Golden Pendant’s *wondrous text.*

If you wish to cross vast seas without a wind-driven wheel, to fly over waves and sand without a cloud chariot, to traverse land without means of ascent, or to ford muddy shallows without a mount, then on land you will be hindered by distant barriers, and on water you will fear drifting and sinking."

How then shall you guide the hundred valleys and dredge the myriad rivers? Perilous and distant indeed! The Supreme One, moved by your resolve, shall bestow upon you the *Wondrous Text of Numinous Treasure*. On land, it commands tigers and leopards; on water, it tames dragons and serpents. It severs the roots of a thousand evils and restrains the hordes of malevolence, that your merit may be fulfilled—does this not reside in the Heaven of Yang Brightness?

The sacred scripture I received also enables one to pass through water and fire unscathed, to roar through the darkest depths, to bind tigers and leopards, to summon the Six Dings, to vanish and traverse the earth, to invert the Five Stars, to preserve the nine generations of ancestors, and to stand peerless beneath heaven.

Thereupon, the attendant maiden Ling Ronghua was commanded to bring forth the *Precious Writ of Supreme Purity* from the cinnabar-jade summit, bestowing it upon Yu. Yu bowed in receipt and departed. With the aid of Geng Chen and Yu Yu, he was able to guide the waters, breach the rivers, and complete his work—honoring the Five Peaks and distinguishing the Nine Provinces. Thus, heaven granted him the Dark Jade Tablet, and he was named Perfected One of the Purple Court.

Later, the Chu minister Song Yu recounted these events to King Xiang, who, failing to seek the essential Dao for long life, built a terrace at Gaotang’s bend and constructed the Yang Terrace Palace to offer sacrifices. Song Yu composed the *Rhapsody of the Divine Woman* to express his sentiments, yet its licentious and vulgar words falsely impute descent to the exalted perfected ones and lofty immortals. A shrine stands at the mountain’s foot, known to the world as the Great Immortal. Across the peak lies the Stone of the Divine Woman, her transformed body. Nearby are the Stone Heavenly Venerable and the Altar of the Divine Woman. Beside the altar, bamboo hangs as if on guard; when withered leaves or flying objects alight upon it, the bamboo sweeps them away with the wind, keeping it spotless and unsullied year after year, generation after generation.

**The Left Lady of Supreme Purity and the Mysterious Clarity**
The Lady is a perfected one of the Supreme Purity. On the seventeenth day of the twelfth month in the third year of the Xingning reign (Yichou, 365 CE), she descended with the Perfected of the Great Prime and a host of immortals to the chamber of Yang Xi, the Perfected of Golden Altar on Mount Juqu. There, she chanted a song from the Northern Pure Palace:

*Lush mists veil not the true void,*
*The Great Prime is my abode.*
*Does the Mysterious Lord harbor longing?*
*Entangled in gloom, I alone endure hardship.*
*Falling phoenix reins in purple auroras,*
*Graceful bridle ascends the dawn’s shore.*
*Silent, boundless, without ripple,*
*Radiant, gazing into the empty expanse.*
*Hidden mushrooms bloom on Phoenix Hill,*
*Wandering the jade grove’s edge.*
*Dragon embryo cradles your form,*
*Eight jades gleam in pristine dawn.*
*Jade orchids flourish in the Jade Palace,*
*Exquisite blossoms cluster on the crags.*
*The roc’s fan spans a hundred peaks,*
*Wings cleave the clouds to soar aloft.*
*In the Western Court, a long song is sung,*
*Proudly plucking the void’s strings.*
*Eight winds coil round emerald eaves,*
*Misty vapors suddenly disperse.*
*Divine youths hurl molten gold,*
*The Supreme Purity unveils its jade table.*
*Three Primes bow in dance,*
*The Purple Emperor waves his sleeves in praise.*
*Mysterious, mysterious—fanning the light’s splendor,*
*Brilliant, brilliant—Venus shines resplendent.*
*Transcendent blades rise in radiant ranks,*
*Gazing below, I sigh for you.*
*Pity the earthbound immortals—*
*Why do they dwell in forests and streams?*

That evening, the host descended, and the Perfected of the Great Prime recounted matters of the Mysterious Clarity Palace. Thereupon, this ode was chanted, embodying the essence of inner cultivation for attaining perfection, to harmonize the spirit. The Lady’s other scriptures and biographies do not prominently record her name or deeds.

**The Numinous Consort of the Eastern Flower Upper Chamber**
The Numinous Consort presides over the Eastern Flower Upper Chamber of the Fangzhu Palace, a lofty station among the celestial perfected, serving as one of the Grand Thearch’s attendants. Her ode declares:

*Purple cassia grows in the jade garden,*
*Crimson blossoms chime like zither strings.*

The Moon Palace births the elixir spring,
The Sun’s midst holds a pool of jade.
To the left, she plucks the radiant orb of sound,
To the right, she grasps the crimson dawn’s glow.
Molten gold illumines the vermilion court,
Eight luminaries transcend the swirling mists.
A verdant canopy floats in bright clarity,
As she commands the nodes to summon the Grand Tenuity.
Phoenix essence blooms in youthful splendor,
Jade richness sates her hunger.
Embracing dawn, she clasps the Primal Simplicity,
Riding reverence, she soars o’er marble terraces.
She exhales and inhales the qi of the Six Voids,
Jade handmaidens bear her sash and follow.
She strums the fan of southern clouds,
Fragrant winds stir her brocade robes.
Striking the *shang* note, a hundred beasts dance,
The Six Heavens yield to her numinous might.
In an instant, reverence spans myriad eons,
Her age towers in majestic splendor.
Yet the small fry remain uncooked in the cauldron—
I speak my sorrow for those beneath the crags.

This ode was also chanted on the night of the seventeenth day of the twelfth month in the third year of Xingning of the Jin (Yichou, 365 CE), when the Perfected of the Great Prime descended into the chamber of Master Yang and recited these verses. They are customarily intoned in the Palace of the Azure Lad to inspire the studies of those cultivating perfection in the Azure Palace, expounding the essentials of discipline and the joys of refinement. This Numinous Consort, too, remains unrecorded in other scriptures and biographies regarding her name or practices.

**The Lady of the Purple Tenuity Palace**
The Lady’s name is Qing’e, styled Yuyin, the twentieth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. Formerly, she descended to transmit the *Precious Scripture of the Supreme’s Numinous Spirits* to Pei Xuanren, who attained the Dao through its practice and was enfeoffed as Perfected of Pure Numinosity. In the sixth month of the third year of Xingning of the Jin (Yichou, 365 CE), she descended into the home of Yang Xi, accompanied by the Perfected of the Great Prime, the Perfected of Tongbai, the Lady of Right Florescence, and the Lady of South Marchmount. Of old, the Lady holds the rank of Left Consort of the Purple Tenuity Palace, presiding over the Upper Palace of the Feathered Wilds’ Mystic Ridge to instruct those destined to achieve perfection. That evening, during the assembly of the Perfected, the Lady of Right Florescence chanted of the affairs of cultivating perfection. The Lady responded with this ode:

*Riding the whirlwind, she nears the Nine Heavens,*
*Halting her chariot at the Three Fair Peaks.*

Amidst the lingering of those who await, she gazes in stillness;
For those unbound by time, tranquility is their due.
Why toil for the azure waves?
How could they compare to the depths of the Mystic Well?

She chanted again:

The Tortoise Watchtower stands towering and grand,
The Moon-Pearl Pavilion gleams with fallen moonlight.
Seated in the Chamber of the Nine Numinous Ones,
We strike our chests and chant of the Great Prime.
Jade flutes harmonize with my spirit,
Golden nectar dissolves my cares.

She chanted again:

Feasting in revelry within the Eastern Florescence,
A thousand melodies resound in perfect accord.
The Azure Lord summons me to rise,
Bowing low, I yearn for the Forest Court.
Feathered robes fan forth emerald radiance,
Jade pendants chime with resonant clarity.
Together we point toward the Lofty Morn Palace,
And vow to meet in the depths of the Celestial Image.

Later, on an excursion to Mystic Ridge, she chanted:

Ascending beyond the Crimson Empyrean,
Soaring winds race through the burial mounds.
Divine splendor illumines the Immortal Terrace,
Round leaps follow the wind’s incline.
Unfurling radiance, she embraces the Cinnabar Origin,
Flying light feasts on the essence of the moon.
Sleeves entwined in the cloud-forested halls,
Vast and boundless, she returns to youthful innocence.
How fleeting, this dwelling without abode—
How could right and wrong ever be contrived?
Those who contend in the dust of the world
Know not the way of nurturing life.

On the sixth day of the ninth month, she descended again, instructing Lord Yang to take up his brush and compose this chant:

Unfurling my wings to ascend the Great Auroral Heights,
I rein in my steeds to reach the Purple Mound.
Grasping the darkness of the Eight Voids,
I loosen my form to float amid the clouds.
One glance commands the web of creation,
A second gaze surveys the lofty wilds.
The essentials of the Dao are now complete—
A thousand sorrows may thus be unraveled.
Seeking truth, I have found true companions;
What more could I desire?

She bade this chant be shown to Director Xu Mu and Magistrate Jun Jiong.

She chanted again:

Amidst the radiant clarity of the Purple Void,
The Dark Palace girds the Crimson River.
In solemn ranks, the Upper Clarity chambers stand,
Cloud terraces gleaming, towering and grand.
Eight chariots ascend to the Vermilion Pool,
Feathered canopies tilt toward the celestial boughs.
The Thunder Wind circles the Three Mornings,
Golden bells scatter jade blossoms.
Seven reins weave through the Nine Gorges,
A fleeting glance—no need for home’s embrace.
I ask you, seeker of the Dao:
Why linger in the dust of that place?
Could you not dwell in Eastern Splendor,
Nurturing truth to shepherd the Great Harmony?

Upon finishing, she again bade this be shown to Xu and Du.

On the seventeenth day of the tenth month, she descended once more with the host of perfected ones, instructing Lord Yang to write:

Grasping the Jade Blossom Canopy in my left hand,
I tread the Seven Origins on beams of light.
The Three Mornings gleam with purple radiance,
My practiced gaze caresses the luminous perfected.
In an instant, I leap and transform—
On all sides, I am my own spirit.
My numinous tresses stretch boundless,
Diligently pondering the scriptures of Upper Clarity.
Why tarry on the crooked path,
Letting your focus waver and stray?
The Dark Slope has lost its mystery,
And you fail to mark the passing years.

When she finished, she addressed Lord Yang slowly:
"Those who are diligent apply themselves to their tasks and immerse in the subtle mysteries. The cautious proceed with care in all things. The difficulty of studying the Dao cannot be fully expressed. Those who harbor shame or vulgarity remain distant from the Way—only through refinement and cultivation may one attain true worth. The wise, in their conduct, awaken further; thus, for now, turn inward and forget."

Then she chanted:

Gazing upon the boundless Dark Clarity,
The setting light emerges from Eastern Slough.
Would that I might find a friend beyond the dust,
Who, like me, shuns worldly schemes.

She repeated this chant again and again, then said:

The numinous ones dwell on Dark Peak,
True spirits veil themselves in cloudy hues.
The Dark Chant is not without its time,
Wondrous responses await their proper moment.
Who could have foreseen the emptiness of the Void,
Yet the purest melody endures?
I gather my robes and ascend the Feathered Palace,
To feast together within the vastness of Guanghan.
I ask you, who is the enlightened one?
Only those who preserve the Jade Child within.

When she finished, she said:
"Like the steed of soaring clouds, its wings outstretched above Kongtong—such a one shall ever embrace the southern face, forever renouncing the thousand chariots."

On the thirtieth day of the second month, she chanted one verse:

Lifting my robes, I ford the swimming river,
And there behold the Lord of Fusang.
A grand assembly in the Wilderness of Great Forest,
A feast of delight in the Dark Blossom Palace.
If your faith in the Dao is pure and steadfast,
Why not dwell on Eastern Peak?
This, too, is the splendor of Donghua, like Shu and Fang.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, she composed seven verses, the first of which reads:

At the radiant ford of dawn’s first light, I rein in my steed and ascend to the Supreme Clarity.
Cloud Terrace looms in towering majesty, its jade gates swinging wide to reveal the resplendent city.
Morning winds stir the cinnabar clouds, crimson mists scatter across the golden court.
Green elixirs gather on the dark peak, purple mushrooms sprout beneath the crags.
Auspicious clouds coil round the cinnabar furnace, alchemical jade scatters as eightfold jasper.
Gazing in delight at the Palace of Vast Cold, ten thousand stalks restore the youth of infants.
Dragon banners resound with prayers that summon the lightning’s spirit, tiger banners marshal the crimson host.
The exalted perfected transcend the Nine Luminaries, their penetrating vision equal to the hidden and the bright.
Who can tread the secluded path and seek my boundless years?

---

Veiled in mist, the Purple Tenuity coils, its lofty terrace scattering radiant winds.
Phoenixes sing beneath the flowered canopy, wind-hooks guide the dragon chariot’s reins.
Eight wolves bear the crimson pennants, white tigers blow the horn and flute.
Clouds surge to depict the numinous palace, descending to the clamor of the dust-bound world.
Loosening the reins where the fair one dwells, kindred spirits naturally summon one another.
To seek the ancestral lineage requires but a moment’s ease—ten thousand years are but a single dawn.
If the appointed time meets with decline, how can one say the kalpas are not distant?
The true and real gaze upon one another—let not the heart’s root be copied.
The empty blade swings toward the void, and the five spirits grieve at the vulgar stagnation.

---

At dawn I open the eastern morning’s glow, my flying team crosses the azure spring.
Mountain waves shake the green shores, the eight winds fan the dark mist.
Gazing afar at the ever-shifting chambers, I hold in my heart the one who moves the true.
Three gold coins may be cast in play, the eastern peak is fit for eternal refinement.
Amid the tumult of the journey, who can tread the ford of life?

---

Drifting upon the Eight Radiance Peaks, I linger beneath the flying morning canopy.
Purple ploughs soar through the great void, my gaze ranges beyond the Nine Emptinesses.
Jade flutes stir the long light, clouds and mists disperse the deep haze.
Exalted immortals feast with the Supreme Perfected, their pure songs boundless.
Coming and going in the courts of mountains and peaks—what need is there for delay?

---

The Divine King illumines the numinous ford, the Seven Primes adorn the spirit’s portals.
Within the square inch of the void, a single leap ascends to the Great Tenuity.
Wondrous tones ride the harmonious chant, the grand assembly too has its mechanism.
Gaze in unison with the celestial and human, soar in concert with the morning’s radiance.
Beyond the six directions, guiding the reins—where is there peril or collapse?

---

A fleeting feast upon the dusty wind’s ridge, the cycles return in green revolutions.
Who knows the measure of ten thousand kalpas? A single glance brings sorrow.

---

The numinous herbs thrive in the dark formula, gazing upward I receive the radiance of the luminous essence.
In tranquil discourse, luxuriant sprouts flourish—he who accumulates virtue will surely prosper.

---

On the night of the seventeenth day of the eighth month, the Lady bestowed upon Lord Yang a command to convey to Prefect Xu:
"Serene and composed in pristine substance, profound and penetrating in wondrous spirit.
Divine craftsmanship surpasses all bounds, dwelling in truth and nurturing life.
The Great Mystery plants the bamboo slips, the Great Simplicity carves the names.
Golden splendor shines within, jade brilliance flourishes without.
Crimson chariots drawn by four, whistling to summon the host of spirits.
Galloping dragons on the Dark Continent, flying clouds in the floating void.
You must befriend the Valley Lord of Leisure Terrace above and oversee the governance of the Great Clarity below."

Thereupon she discussed with the Lord of Life-Preservation the Nine Methods of Far-Reaching Aspiration, and further said:
"Thoughts should not be many—many thoughts scatter the will. A scattered will in pursuit of freedom from illness is like closing the gate to repel a fierce enemy."

The Lady composed methods for ingesting arts to circulate in the world. Shu said:
"Those who in the morning align with the vast origin, penetrate the dark and secluded, and harmonize the eight qi before the numinous barrier is ordered—let them alone observe the emptiness with equanimity, follow heaven’s course, and stand in the void.
Thus, pure tones softly chant, harmonious winds arise in concert, the two luminaries bear radiance, and the clouds of dawn await nothing.
Embracing the sprouts at their uncarved inception, blocking the ten thousand sources at the loom’s head—all living things return to truth, each kind concealing its origin.
One may scoff at ten thousand years as a fleeting span, yet regard infant years as long harmony.
Why trouble the body in the dark realm of the divine and the spirit, or delve into the borrowed sounds of esoteric methods beyond the distant reaches?
Those whose forms lack the vessel for attaining truth, whose implements lack the function for serving truth—truly, they should tread the guiding principles of Heaven’s Origin, push the ten thousand essences to their utmost subtlety, seek the nine wefts to refine life, behold the morning’s radiance in its far-reaching illumination, and gaze upward at the misty qi where the six spirits coil through the void.
Bending low to the six pitch-pipes, the eight winds fan their might.
The Great Origin emits the dark and secluded whistle, the round luminaries cast their radiance upon the empty sky.
Thus, purple clouds gather in beauty, waves surge against crumbling peaks, floating mists envelop images, and the clear light roams in flight.
The five phases slay and harm, the four seasons contend in exchange.
Metal and earth draw close, water and fire form rifts.
Forests and grasses halt and lie prone, the hundred rivers close and block.
Vast lightning rages and seethes, thunder shakes east and west, splitting and rending.
Heaven’s constriction manifests as the calamity of the Nine Yangs, earth’s obstruction becomes the convergence of the Hundred Sixes.
A single moment of regret exhausts the cycle at Qian’s extremity; beholding the flock of dragons snatching with their claws, blood flows in Kun’s wilds.
Thereupon fortune and misfortune clash, the multitude displays omens of disaster and blame.
Those who tread the level path—will the reclusive person not find good fortune?
Those who dwell in fertile seclusion—will there be any place they do not prosper?
Yet those who recklessly display their banners—must they not encounter corpses in the northeast, where companions perish and regret follows?
To cross great rivers is inauspicious; to sink into the well’s depths is ruinous.
All this arises when humans lose their truth, when things deviate from my harmony.
In the myriad pursuits of rivalry, spirits and ghosts employ their schemes, even causing heaven and earth to lack constancy, taking the hundred clans as their heart.
Thus, the Supreme Perfected Ones pitied the surging of the ten thousand currents and opened the dark ford to awaken the worthy.
Thereupon they guided and enlightened the hundred transformations, grasped the principles of nurturing life, and made them complete.
Those who dwell in fortune and virtue remain whole; those who abide in peril and harm wither and break.
Those who master the six qi extend their years; those who ingest the numinous mushrooms attain spirit’s ease.
Esoteric methods and superior arts unfold in the mysteries of the clear void; golden palaces and jade texts are compiled on the Terrace of Committed Feathers.
In the profound and distant divine chant, the true radiance harmonizes—when the stanzas of the *Song of Union and Separation* are sung, one reins in the morning at the Great Tenuity.
Employing its Way, one wheels through the nine gorges, chariots and canopies arrayed in the ranks of flowing clouds, gazing fondly upon the Terrace of Literary Florescence.
Some refine the furnace, turning cinnabar’s dark essence; some grind and smelt the purple nectar of gold and jade.
Langgan stirs in luxuriant splendor, its blossoms flowing as eightfold jasper; clouds gleam and the crimson liquid flies.
The dragon’s embryo turns in the returning waves, the tiger’s foam and phoenix’s brain—cloudy langgan and jade frost.
The Great Ultimate’s cinnabar wine, the Three Rings’ numinous steel—if one presents but a knife’s tip, it shall be accomplished."

The divine wings unfurl, and one dons the supreme scriptures of the *Void and Cavern*, entering the resplendent chamber of the Primordial Beginning. Jade tones and jasper texts issue forth from the Palace of the Three Mysteries; precious sashes coil as gifts from the Three Origins, and one ascends the cinnabar chambers of elixir and nectar. The Celestial Thearch offers the radiant weight of purple ploughing; the Supreme Perfected bestows the fiery bells of flowing gold. Divine youths unseal the chariot shafts, nine phoenixes cry in unison, celestial pipes startle the void, and morning bells chime with crystalline clarity. Refining the body, one gently ascends—eight luminous scenes float in the sky. Dragon chariots and tiger retinues roam the eight directions, ascending to the utmost heights of Eternal Yang, descending to recline in the orchid halls of inverted reflections. The Moon Consort harnesses the four-horse team, while the radiance of the Sun’s splendor illuminates her visage; divine maidens present fragrant incense, and smoke overflows the windows. Gazing back, one strides through the circular net of the heavens—how could the nine myriad be deemed sufficient?

Thereafter, one knows that the Way of the lofty immortals ascends ever higher, that the subtleties of seeking the numinous are wondrously profound, that the culmination of ingestion and adornment unites with the divine, and that the workings of fortune and misfortune become instantly manifest. Were it not for the peerless scion of Wu Ying, who received the jade scriptures of the Yellow and the Old—the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*—and the transcendent seven origins of the Supreme Lord’s Hidden Mystery, none could assemble a fellowship to guard this path.

Yet there are those who embody the divine, refine their thoughts in the Hall of Brilliance, and at dawn traverse the Six Voids to make the Five Viscera flourish. They guard and seal the Primordial Pass, inwardly preserving the Nine Perfected; the Three Blacks circulate the elixir to irrigate the cinnabar field—this, too, is a secondary path. As for those who loosely grasp the cinnabar’s sincerity, what need have they for the grand sacrifices of neighboring states?

One may further add the waters of the five clouds, the roots of cassia, Solomon’s seal, the yang herbs of southern candlewood, the hollow stones of the east, the resin of green pines, the seeds of cypress, sesame, and the slender roots of poria. These are all instruments of nurturing life, by which one may attain longevity. I have also observed that among plants and trees, some swiftly benefit the self, though their efficacy has yet to match the manifold proofs of wood’s potency. Yet since recent times, killing qi has shrouded the heavens, baleful smoke has dimmed the light, and perverse demons have risen in profusion, bringing a hundred afflictions in their wake. Some suffer from wind-cold blockages, others from flowing swellings and chronic ailments; calamities strike without warning, and illnesses arise beyond expectation—such misfortunes have gathered daily.

The qi of wood restrains ghostly fluids; exhaled smoke subdues the joints of perverse forces. It strengthens the flesh, gathers the hun-soul, enriches the blood, and generates the brain. It expels evil and attains the true, guards the essence, and defends life. Consuming its sustenance, one’s spirit becomes supple, the four limbs flourish, and the body grows light and agile. Ingesting its pills and powders, a hundred illnesses vanish, and the Five Viscera brim with elixir. Thus, one attains long life, far-seeing clarity, and enduring numinosity—ancients named it the herb of mountain essence, the essence of mountain ginger. The *Inscription on Guiding Immortals* by the Supreme Lord states: *"If you desire long life, consume mountain essence; if you desire lightness and flight, consume mountain ginger."* This is its meaning.

I see that among all things, all may be stored, but wood is most beneficial. Its uses are precisely what the present age requires, for in this latter age, illnesses abound, and one ought to ingest and adorn oneself accordingly. Though the Way may be inwardly sufficient, one still fears calamities from without; though the form may be outwardly full, it may yet suffer inner collapse. Can the perils of partiality and imbalance not serve as a warning?

Wood serves two purposes: first, it grants long life and eternal longevity; second, it repels the myriad demons’ unjust afflictions. I have seen recluses in the mountains who, having attained this Way, live for a thousand years, eight hundred, their shoulders brushing the Five Peaks. Yet people, overwhelmed by the profusion of texts, cannot recall even a fraction—I have thus compiled these methods of ingesting wood to enlighten the devoted. If one firmly believes and applies them, one may avert sudden disasters. When the Great Peace arrives, the four qi harmonize, the heavenly warp weaves life, calamitous smoke vanishes, the Five Poisons hide their forms, and the two dawns ever watch over all things, allowing them to flourish. At such a time, one may follow one’s inclinations in ingestion and adornment without fear of premature demise.

Yet some among the later learners, vying and contending, often employ indiscriminate methods, including the techniques of the Yellow Script and the Red Realm—these truly foster mutual generation, harmonizing the two images and matching their essential principles. If one employs the Way to dissolve the nets and escape the snares, aligning with the six harmonies and practicing according to the seasonal nodes, one may dispel calamities, congeal the essence, and treasure the embryo. Above, this ensures the brain spirit remains unharmed; below, it fills the Three Fields to overflowing. Advancing and retreating in proper measure, misfortunes vanish; warp and weft align, and long health endures. Enemies grasp the reins yet do not falter; the six armies march forth and return whole—such are its benefits, though not the grandest affairs of the immortal families.

Alas, how perilous! Though these methods guard through mutual generation, they lose the Way of transcending the world, resembling one who races an ice chariot across a river or sails a fiery boat upon drowning waters. Without true rectitude, failure is certain—ten thousand times over. Some violate celestial patterns, usurping and harming through jealousy; the numinous root becomes obstructed, and fortune and misfortune remain divided. They break vows and covenants, offending the Three Officials; they encounter enmity and calamity, their royal armies defeated; they dig pits to bury captives, their blood soaking the wilds; or their horses’ strength is exhausted, yet they demand more. Those who recklessly venture into the northern frontier without defense will surely perish by the blades of cruel slaves, dying abroad while their families are executed at home. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious?

I have seen few among such practitioners who gain true benefit; their vain pursuits of life only bring sighs for the living. How much better to guard the cinnabar truth in the Crimson Palace, to summon the primordial spirit in the Muddy Pellet, to preserve the essence and elixir without loss, to seal the dark guard at the Gate of Life, to ingest numinous wood to nurture life, to rinse the spirit with flowery springs, to study the secret diagrams of the mysterious and wondrous, and to recite the hidden chapters of the Supreme Lord. Thus, one may dwell loftily among the peaks, discussing the years alongside gold and stone. What lord could claim such a one as friend? What emperor could make them a subject? Far from the five turbidities of the dusty world, one remains ever pure, awaiting the true. Leisurely, carefree—let me delight in this cloudy repose.

Those who take ingesting wood as their starting point do so to expound exhortations and warnings for students of immortality—it is not merely about consuming wood. Their talents are abundant, their words elegant, their learning profound, their principles vast, vast as the long waves of the great sea or the layered peaks of towering mountains.

Yet their admonitions grow ever more earnest, their expositions ever more fitting—ought one not take them as master and receive their teachings, inscribe them and wear them close? The merit of guiding others toward goodness endures through a thousand ages; how could the Perfected Ones be so mindful of mortals, how could the Most Sagely Ones show such compassion for all beings?

**The Lady of Supreme Perfection**
The Lady was the youngest daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. At sixteen or seventeen years of age, her name was Wanluo, her courtesy name Bodui. She served the Supreme Perfection King of the Mysterious Capital and bore a son who became the Director of the Bureau of Records in the Three Heavens’ Supreme Palace, overseeing the tallying of transgressions in the celestial courts—akin to an earthly minister. In his youth, he favored idle neglect of his duties, and when the matter was reported by his superiors, he was demoted to govern the Eastern Marchmount, removed from the register of the True King, and placed in charge of the teachers of ghosts and spirits, a post that changes hands every five hundred years.

The Lady came to visit him and urged him to diligently attend to his duties to atone for his faults. Passing through Linzi, she encountered a minor county clerk named He Junxian, who had been grievously harmed by a past-life enemy and lay at the brink of death.

The Lady, seeing that his bone structure bore unusual marks, took pity on him and asked what injury had brought him to such a state. Junxian answered truthfully. The Lady said, "Your wound was inflicted by a heavy blade piercing the lung. The five viscera are ruptured, blood congeals in the Crimson Palace, and qi surges beyond the intestines—this is a mortal crisis. How could one revive from such a state?" Junxian, realizing she was a divine being, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy, begging for salvation. The Lady drew a pill from her sleeve pouch, no larger than a small bean, and immediately had him take it. In an instant, he was cured; the bleeding ceased, the wound closed, and all pain vanished.

Junxian bowed twice and knelt, saying, "My family’s wealth is meager, and I know not how to repay your kindness. I can only offer my humble efforts in service." The Lady replied, "If you truly wish to thank me, your intent is commendable. Would you follow me?" Junxian then changed his name and style, calling himself Ma Mingsheng, and accompanied the Lady as her attendant.

The Lady returned to the sheer cliffs of Mount Tai in the Eastern Marchmount, where a stone chamber nestled among towering crags and hidden depths, over a thousand *zhang* above the earth. Within the chamber stood a golden bed, a jade table, rare treasures, and extraordinary jades—places no mortal foot could reach. At first, Mingsheng served dutifully, hoping only to learn the art of healing sword wounds. But upon witnessing the comings and goings of immortals, he came to know of the Way of Undying.

Day and night, he attended to her needs, sweeping and cleaning without the slightest negligence. The Lady tested him with apparitions, tigers, wolves, illusions, and myriad transformations, yet Mingsheng remained composed and unafraid. She also sent him to lodge elsewhere, where a beautiful woman attempted to seduce him in his sleep, but his heart remained steadfast, his resolve unshaken.

At times, the Lady would depart for ten or five days, or even a month or twenty days before returning. Each time, he saw immortals and guests arriving on dragons and phoenixes, or paying homage—true transcendents filling the chamber for days on end. When guests arrived, she would send Mingsheng to another room, yet exquisite delicacies, rare fruits, fragrant wines, and wondrous brews would appear unbidden, beyond description. At times, she would call Mingsheng to sit and share the feast.

He also heard the sounds of zithers and lutes, and songs of ethereal beauty. The Lady herself would sometimes play the qin, which had but a single string yet produced all five notes, its resonant tones carrying for miles. Birds gathered at the mouth of the cave, circling and soaring, driven away only to return—such was the natural wonder of celestial music.

The Lady dwelled there, sharing the stone chamber with Mingsheng, though they slept on separate couches. In that secluded place, only the two of them remained. When she departed, she never revealed her destination, but he would see a white dragon arrive to welcome her. She would don a cloud-luminous embroidered robe, mount the white dragon, and depart. The robe shimmered with moonlight, its seams adorned with pearls, her waist girded with jade pendants, and her head crowned with the Golden Flower of the Supreme Mystery. No attendants accompanied her. Upon her return, the dragon would vanish, its whereabouts unknown.

Upon the jade bed in the stone chamber lay purple brocade bedding and a gossamer canopy. Within were treasures and curios—golden vessels, sealed caskets, and arrays of black and yellow silk—none of which existed in the mortal world, their names unknowable. Two scrolls of plain silk bore the title *The Scripture of the Great Perfection of the Nine Heavens*. Mingsheng dared not unroll them to read their contents. He only tended to the water, swept the chamber, and guarded the cave, never daring to touch the treasures or ask questions.

For five years, his diligence and reverence only grew, never wavering. The Lady sighed and said to him, "You are truly teachable and will surely attain the Dao. Though you are a mortal, you have not succumbed to lust or arrogance. You have revered the numinous qi without fail—even death itself could not claim you. I shall now tell you of my origins: I have long dwelled among mortals, but now, by the command of the Lord King and the summoning of the Supreme, I may no longer remain. I think fondly of your devotion and thus confide in you. I wished to teach you the methods of longevity and the arts of extending life, but the elixir I would impart—the *Taihe* Natural Dragon Embryo Nectar—is suited only for the True Persons of the Three Heavens, not for beginners like you. Even if you heard of it, you could not master its use.

There is Master Anqi’s method for refining the Golden Liquid Elixir. Its formula is secret and potent, a path of the Nine Lords and the Supreme Unity that grants ascension to heaven in broad daylight. Master Anqi will arrive tomorrow, and I shall entrust you to him. With time, he will surely transmit his arts to you."

The next day, Master Anqi arrived, riding a dappled dragon and clad in a crimson robe, a *yuanyou* cap, jade pendants, and a tiger-headed satchel. He appeared no older than twenty, radiant and dignified, accompanied by six or seven immortals bearing insignia and serving as his retinue. He paid deep respect to the Lady, bowing and addressing her as his subordinate.

Soon, wine, fruits, and delicacies were laid out, and they feasted for half a day. Anqi recounted, "Once, I traveled with you, my lady, to the western shores of the Parthian Sea, where we ate dates of unmatched sweetness—none here compare. Yet it has been two thousand years since that time." The Lady replied, "I recall we shared a single date and could not finish it. How could these small dates compare?"

Anqi said, "Recently, I visited the Nine Rivers to see Lord Si Yin and Lady Xi Han. They inquired about the *yang* cycle of nine and six, the era when the Sage Lord receives the Mandate, and the tribulations of fate. I replied that I was too young to understand the reckoning of such epochs and suggested they consult the Lady of the Supreme Perfection. Now that I have the honor of your company, I would ask of these matters."

The Lady replied, "The cycles of fate and the vast currents of time are not matters you can readily grasp. Heaven and Earth have their great *yang* nines and great hundred-sixes, as well as their lesser *yang* nines and lesser hundred-sixes. The trials of heaven are called *yang* nine, and the deficiencies of earth are called hundred-six—these two calamities are the adversity and prosperity of Heaven and Earth, the eclipses of yin and yang. The great cycle spans nine thousand nine hundred years, while the lesser cycle spans three thousand three hundred years. Even when these cycles converge upon a sage-king, he cannot avert them; the realm may perish, yet good fortune will eventually restore itself.

The great calamity has not yet fully come to pass. The present Tang era marks the beginning of a lesser *yang* nine. By reckoning, when the year *jiashen* arrives, the hundred-six will converge. At that time, the Dao and virtue will flourish, while wickedness will run rampant. The sage-king destined to receive the Mandate will do so in the year *renchen*—no more than a thousand years hence, and it will soon be upon us. The Lady of the Western Han has already witnessed these events, so her inquiry was likely a test.

Yet this is also the domain of Lord Si Yin. During a *yang* nine, great droughts arise, the seas surge, and the land burns. During a hundred-six, the seas dry up, mountains collapse into ravines, and the four seas fill with hidden waters. The dark continents sink, and mountains rise where cities once stood. Whales a thousand fathoms long and serpents of ten thousand feet, unable to endure the turning of fate, will knock upon heaven’s gates, pleading for water. Litigation will spread across the celestial courts, overwhelming the Three Heavens with petitions, and even Lord Si Yin will weary of meticulous judgment.

The mouth of the Nine Rivers is where the Red Waters rush in, its depths unfathomable—yet now it gradually dries. The eight *qi* steam from mountains and marshes, and shifting sands choke the river sources. When the four seas converge, dragons will thrash and dance. In the year *jiashen*, the *yin* floods will reverse their flow. Now, the Water Mother ascends to the Gate of Heaven to announce the appointed time. The Stone of Accumulation will split open, releasing ten thousand springs, and the *yin* winds will surge, tormenting the mortal realm. Dark currents will spread far and wide, overflowing for years—until, after nine years, the deluge finally subsides.

Those who attain the Dao, ascend to perfection, and merge their essence with the mysterious—when that time comes, they need only soar through the void to gaze upon the waves of mountains, roam the floating peaks to survey the vast rivers, ride the dark swan to the Crimson City, or mount the rainbow chariot to traverse the radiant clouds. In the blink of an eye, they may wander at will, delighting body and spirit. Why trouble your mind with such matters?

For now, let us speak of wine and nothing more." Then, pointing to Mingsheng, she said to Anqi, "This one harbors sincere devotion and may yet be taught. Once, by chance, he followed Lǜ Sui here. Though his nature is not yet fully refined and his desires have faded, he is not yet ready to receive the mysteries of the Great Harmony or the Way of Supreme Perfection. For now, I would have him study under you to learn the formula for the Golden Liquid Elixir. If he proves capable, you may take him along.

The common folk are frail in heart and lung, their viscera thin, their blood and fluids depleted, their liver and spine unsupported. Their eyes, lips, and mouth cannot discern the workings of fate. Their great compassion does not align with heaven and humanity; they strive to run but cannot attain the swiftness of spirit-flight. It is fitting to comfort and guide them to fulfill their aspirations, not to test them with the eight divine transformations. Do not press him too harshly, lest he lose his way."

Anqi replied, "Very well, though I fear my knowledge is shallow and my arts insufficient to instruct him. I once received this formula from the Elder of Broad Accomplishment. My master’s virtue was most wondrous, his mind profound and obscure—seeing without sight, hearing without sound. His movements left no trace, his stillness no residue. His spirit roamed the dark void, his four limbs rested in the numinous mounds. His will dwelled upon Kongtong’s heights, and in an instant, the grasses and trees at his knees flourished into towering forests. When he moved, it was as if striking the earth without speech; when sought, he vanished like a transplanted sapling, leaving no word. I knew not how he attained his arts, nor the cause of his mastery. At that time, I was truly at a loss.

For forty or fifty years, I served him diligently, never slackening, tending to his needs with devotion. Gradually, he deigned to glance my way and began to enlighten me. Now, I cross the boiling pools to enter the land of life, my crimson countenance restored, as I seek his guidance. He revealed to me the difficulty and ease of the Way and bestowed the essential teachings of the Golden Liquid. This is my master’s established method—I dare not transmit it hastily. Yet I vow that within twenty years, I will surely guide him to traverse the celestial paths."

"Once, I accompanied you, my lady, to the Round Mound, where we observed the withering of the Nine Gorges and gazed upon the Weak Waters flowing east. We were granted the fragrant wine of dark jade, and without regard for rank, we sang in joy. I once opened the sacred vessel to behold the *Linglu*, and by chance, I saw the formula for the Jade Embryo and the Elixir of Luminous Fat. Taking but a knife’s tip of it, one ascends to the clouds in an instant, sheds one’s form to undergo myriad transformations, and rises as a True Sovereign. This art is swift and wondrous, surpassing even the essence of the Golden Liquid and outpacing the sharpness of the Ninefold Frost-Snow Elixir. I do not mean to criticize by forsaking the near for the distant, the direct for the circuitous. Truly, I wish to know the hierarchy of divine formulas and the exalted ranks of the perfected immortals. If I humble myself excessively, it would be improper. Yet if we speak of the formula for the Elixir of Luminous Fat, must it be reserved for attendants alone, never to be used?"

The Lady replied, "Do you not know? This is the sacred formula of the Heavenly Sovereign, fitting only for the perfected. It is not something the common dead may trespass upon. The elixirs of immortality are ranked in nine grades:

The first is called *Great Harmony*, the natural nectar of langgan.
The second is called *Jade Embryo*, the ointment of luminous fat.
The third is called *Flying Elixir*, the flowing essence of purple radiance.
The fourth is called *Crimson Light*, the rich marrow of cloud-jade.
The fifth is called *Nine Springs*, the divine elixir of red radiance.
The sixth is called *Great Clarity*, the essence of the Golden Liquid.
The seventh is called *Ninefold*, the Frost-Snow Elixir.
The eighth is called *Cloud Radiance*, the Jade of the Nine Cauldrons.
The ninth is called *Flying Elixir of Flowing Stone*.

These are the nine grades of elixirs. Those who attain immortality are also ranked in nine grades:

The first, the highest immortals, are called *True Kings of the Nine Heavens*.
The second are called *True Sovereigns of the Three Heavens*.
The third are called *Supreme Perfected*."

The fourth are called *Flying Heaven Perfected*.
The fifth are called *Numinous Immortals*.
The sixth are called *Perfected*.
The seventh are called *Numinous Ones*.
The eighth are called *Flying Immortals*.
The ninth are called *Immortals*.

These are the nine grades of immortals, each with its own rank and distinction, none to be transgressed. Even those who have mastered the Golden Liquid have already surpassed the ordinary. As for the elixirs consumed by the Jade Emperor, they are not for the shallow of learning to hear.

Though you have attained the Dao and lingered long in the world, the clamor of defilement still clings to your true blackness, and the dust of the Three Ones drums upon you. I fear you may yet be unfit to ascend the Three Heavens and pay homage to the Supreme, to stride past Fusang and meet the Supreme Perfected. The formula for the *Jade Embryo* may still elude you—how much less could those of lesser talent be allowed to hear even its name?

Anqi, his countenance briefly shifting, rose from his seat and said: "This humble one truly did not know the wondrous distinctions among the marvelous grades of divine medicines. I am indeed astonished to hear of them." Then he spoke further: "This humble one has heard that the Lady possesses the *Nine Heavens Supreme Perfected Scripture of the Dao*, the *Luminous Mirror of Clarity and Emptiness*, which illumines the darkest mysteries. Though it is not for one of my meager talent to gaze upon, I have been favored with your guidance for so long and have been repeatedly drawn near. Not measuring my own worth, I dare to beg for your instruction. Might I be permitted to see this scripture? If I could but briefly glimpse the Supreme Perfected, even fish-eyes would be transformed into pearls."

The Lady smiled faintly and, after a long pause, said: "The Supreme Dao dwells in the distant and secluded True Treasury—how could one of your station presume to engage with it? You should only strive to perfect today’s achievements and not boast of labors beyond your station. I am but briefly traveling north to the Dark Continent, then east to visit Fangzhang, where I shall review the immortal officials in the Jade Court. I shall wander Penglai to conceal my radiance. The Supreme has commanded me to personally settle the immortals beyond the Flowing Sands, to receive the vast flight within the chambers of the Nine Firmaments, to examine the distant records of the Perfected, to summon the celestial spirits from Kunlun, to rinse the dragon embryo in the palace of the Dark Capital, and to test the jade maidens in the hall of the assembled immortals. With heavenly affairs so numerous and pressing, I shall have no leisure to show you the *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected*.

If you can diligently cultivate the *Orthodox Unity* in the *Great Clarity*, master the wondrous records of the *Three Sovereigns*, embrace the divine radiance in the secluded groves, command the assembled immortals upon the Five Peaks, summon the mountain forms to gather the host of spirits, and dispatch Heng and Hua to command the Four Streams—then seek me upon the mounds of the Three Heavens, find me upon Zhongshan or Wangwu, and the true scripture may yet be bestowed upon you. If not, you would do better to abandon a swift steed and walk the dark paths, to cast aside the boat’s mechanism and cross the Qi Sea.

Consider how you spend your days: refining the Golden Liquid to seek true joy in life, preserving life by nurturing the upright qi to cultivate the body, thereby restoring youthful hair to a childlike face and safeguarding long vision by the numinous springs. As for the cycles of yang decline and the nine-and-six calamities that descend in due time—safety and peril are not fixed, fortune and misfortune stand in opposition. Look far, and let your heart be stirred with emotion. The disasters of excess may be avoided but not averted. The appointed time is bound to the fate of the sage-ruler, who cannot foresee it. Thus did Boyang abandon Zhou, and thus did the Pass Keeper perceive the ruin of his state. The affairs of heaven and humanity are manifest in all things. Why do you remain so preoccupied with becoming an earthbound immortal?

How much better to awaken early and soar high, transcending the dust of the world to keep yourself pure! Avoid the dark paths of the jia-shen year, and stand equal among the true and numinous. My words have expressed the fullness of my heart—may you take them to heart."

Anqi bowed deeply and said: "Today’s teachings I shall immediately undertake to practice."

The Lady then addressed Mingsheng: "I cannot stay longer. You shall go with this gentleman and need not worry. I shall visit you from time to time." She then presented him with two *Five Nurturings* poems, which could sustain their bond.

Mingsheng, his tears flowing, took his leave. He then followed Master Anqi to receive the Way of the Nine Elixirs. The poems read:

**I**
Briefly I inscribed within the walled city,
Then commanded my carriage to Mount Tai’s slopes.
I gazed up at the gate of the Great Clarity—
Cloud towers, lofty and jagged.
Within the void dwells the Perfected,
Coming and going in such profusion.
Refining the form to preserve the natural,
Bowing and rising, embracing the Great Harmony.
Each dawn, the Nine Heavenly Kings;
Each evening, feasting again in the Western Flower.
Flowing essence can take flight,
Exhaling and inhaling to nurture the green sprout.
Supreme joy is not in gold or stone,
But in the wind that sings its natural song.
Above and below, soaring through the radiant skies,
How the feathered robes sway and dance!
The Five Peaks are not my chamber,
The Dark Capital is my home.
Behold the striving sons of glory,
As stubborn as frogs and toads.
They turn their hips within the dust and filth,
Entangling themselves in cares and woes.
If they have not yet awakened to the wondrous truth,
Why trouble themselves with carving and polishing?
Disaster follows when the Dao is leaked,
But secrecy brings abundant blessings.

**II**
Once I dwelt in the palace of Kunlun,
Together we discoursed on prolonging heaven’s years.
Though the Golden Liquid grants long life,
It is not like the immortality of the Great Harmony.
I gazed up to the Tower of Dark Spirit,
In empty reverie chanting to the Numinous One.
Suddenly I met the King of Fusang,
The Nine Elders, Perfected of the Immortal Capital.
They drove a chariot of purple glue,
Their numinous countenances so fresh and bright.
They urged me to seek the long path,
Invited me to the ford of the natural.
They taught me the art of vast flight,
Bestowed upon me the *Jade Embryo Scroll*.
The jade ointment congealed in the dark vessel,
The White Maiden expounded it for me.
Bowing, I embraced the fat of the numinous phoenix,
Gazing up, I soared to the Three Heavens.
The cloud net set the pace for my steps—
The Five Peaks could be briefly revisited.
How distant is the Dark Capital?
Penglai lies within reach.
Transmission and bestowal deepen our bond,
We become friends among the heavenly and human.
Revealing it brings punishment in kind,
Disaster spares neither fool nor sage.
Keep it secret, and enjoy unending stability;
Leak it, and body and life will fall.
**The Second**

Upon concluding the poem, Ming-sheng followed Anqi and his sworn friend into Mount Nüji, where the Lady departed upon a cloud-dragon.

For twenty years, Ming-sheng traveled with his master through Qingcheng, Lu, and Gang, until he received the formula for Golden Liquor, refined and ingested it, and ascended to heaven.

**Lady Ma Gu**

Lady Ma Gu was the secondary attendant of the Supreme Perfected Sovereign. During the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han, the divine immortal Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, descended upon the household of Cai Jing. As he approached, the sound of drums, flutes, and a procession of men and horses filled the air for the span of an hour. Upon arrival, the entire household beheld him.

Fangping wore a far-wandering cap, a crimson robe, a tiger-headed tally bag, a sash of five colors, and a sword. His temples bore a faint yellow hue, and he was of average stature. He rode a feather-canopied chariot drawn by five dragons, each of a different color. His retinue bore signal flags and banners, marching before and behind with the majesty of a great general. Twelve companies of five hundred warriors, their mouths sealed with wax, played drums and flutes. They rode qilin down from the heavens, alighting in the courtyard. The attendants, all over a *zhang* in height, vanished upon arrival, leaving only Fangping to greet Cai Jing’s father, brothers, and mother. After sitting alone for a long while, he dispatched a messenger to summon Ma Gu to the household.

Jing knew not who Ma Gu was. The messenger said, “Wang Fangping respectfully inquires of the Lady: I have not ventured among mortals for some time, but now that I am here, might the Lady deign to visit for a conversation?” After a while, the messenger returned—his form unseen, only his voice heard—saying, “Ma Gu bows twice. Though we have not met for over five hundred years, propriety remains, and I dare not neglect courtesy. I have received your summons and shall arrive shortly. However, I have first been commanded by the Emperor to inspect Penglai. I shall make a brief journey there and return at once to pay my respects. I pray you do not depart before then.” After two intervals of time, Ma Gu arrived.

Her approach was likewise heralded by the sound of men, horses, drums, and flutes. Upon arrival, her retinue was half the size of Fangping’s. When Ma Gu entered, the entire Cai household beheld her: a fair maiden of eighteen or nineteen, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her garments bore patterns beyond description, neither brocade nor silk, their radiance too dazzling to name—none such existed in the mortal world.

She entered and bowed to Fangping, who rose to greet her. Once seated, he summoned the kitchen to present the feast. Countless golden platters and jade cups appeared. The dishes were mostly flowers and fruits, their fragrance filling the inner and outer chambers. She tore strips of dried meat, passing them as if roasted, saying it was qilin jerky.

Ma Gu herself remarked, “Since I began my service, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields thrice. Upon arriving at Penglai this time, the waters were shallower than before—barely half their former depth. Might it soon revert to dry land?” Fangping laughed and said, “The sages all say that even the seas will one day rise as dust.”

She then wished to see Cai Jing’s mother and his wife and nieces. At that moment, Jing’s sister-in-law had just given birth days before. Ma Gu, upon seeing her, exclaimed, “Ah! Hold, do not approach.” She then asked for a small measure of rice.

She took the rice and scattered it upon the ground, saying she used the grains to dispel the impurity. When they looked, the rice had all turned into genuine pearls. Fangping laughed and said, “Ma Gu is still young indeed. I am old now and no longer take pleasure in such clever transformations.”

Fangping then addressed Cai Jing’s family, “I wish to bestow upon you some wine. This wine comes from the Heavenly Kitchen, its flavor rich and mellow—unfit for mortals to drink undiluted, lest it corrode their bowels. Today I shall mix it with water; do not be alarmed.” He blended one *sheng* of wine with one *dou* of water, stirring it before offering it to Cai Jing’s household. Each person drank about one *sheng* and became intoxicated. After a long while, the wine was finished. Fangping said to his attendants, “There is not enough; go back and fetch more.” He then gave a thousand coins to an old woman from Yuhang, instructing her to purchase wine. Shortly after the messenger departed, a leather flask containing about five *dou* of oil-sack wine was returned, along with a message from the old woman of Yuhang: “I fear earthly wine is unworthy of the exalted immortals.”

Ma Gu’s nails resembled those of a crow. Cai Jing, upon seeing them, thought to himself, *“If my back itches terribly, would it not be wonderful to have such nails to scratch it?”* Fangping, already aware of Cai Jing’s thoughts, immediately had someone drag him away and whip him, saying, “Ma Gu is a divine immortal—how could you casually suggest using her nails to scratch your back?” They saw the whip strike Cai Jing’s back, yet no one holding the whip was visible. Fangping admonished Cai Jing, “My whip is not to be taken lightly.”

That day, he also bestowed upon Cai Jing one talisman and one transmission. Their neighbor, Magistrate Chen, could summon ghosts and demons to heal the sick, and Cai Jing had likewise mastered the art of molting like a snake or cicada. Jing often accompanied Lord Wang on journeys through mountains and seas, sometimes returning home briefly. Lord Wang would also send letters to Magistrate Chen, written in a script resembling seal characters or standard script, the strokes bold and expansive. Chen’s family treasured these letters for generations.

When the feast concluded, Fangping and Ma Gu ordered their carriages and ascended to heaven, their procession led by flutes and drums as before.

*Records of the Immortals Gathered at the Walled City, Scroll Four* ends here.
*Records of the Immortals Gathered at the Walled City, Scroll Five* begins.

Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty *Collected Writings on the Perfected* records:

The Perfected Consort of the Cloudy Forest, Right Radiance, the Lady Wang of the Cloudy Forest—styled Meilan, with the given name Shenlin—was the thirteenth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. She received the scriptures and was appointed Right Radiance Consort of the Cloudy Forest Palace, governing the Azure Waves Palace.

In the third year of Xingning of the Jin Dynasty (365 CE), the seventh day of the seventh month, she descended alongside the True Lord of Destiny, Minister of the Eastern Peak, and a host of perfected beings to bestow teachings upon Master Yang. There she received the scriptures, which declared:

*"Your latent virtue, though profound, has not yet fully unfolded; your karmic roots, though deep, remain entangled, and though you aspire to progress, you have not yet plumbed the ultimate principle. Your talents are of celestial craftsmanship, your heart as clear as still waters congealing into waves of lofty resonance. You grasp the handle of the Great Mystery, poised to tread the Purple Court and wander the void. Your mind penetrates the stagnant and soaring, your brush flourishes in dark harmony. In motion, you align with compass and square, equal in roundness and distinct in form; in stillness, you harmonize with true savor, exhaling lingering echoes. Truly, your unbounded virtue and towering bearing command reverence. Yet impure thoughts linger, unrefined and inwardly constrained; wayward desires persist, and the pool of spirit remains turbid. Thus, we cannot yet discourse with you on the cyclical rhythms of inner and outer, nor the convergence of the Two Luminaries.*

*Yet he who misses the moment but can reform, who releases attachments and nurtures compassion—no harm shall befall him. Though you may briefly veil the many listeners, harmony shall yet prevail. The path ahead is vast, and such lapses are not singular; myriad threads entangle. You must ever guard your secrecy. Should your resolve falter, should your focus scatter, should you err in conduct or lose clarity in speech—how then shall you restrain or dispel such failings?*

*When pure tones scatter through the void and divine winds bathe the forest, when the body transcends the dark thoroughfare and the will chants numinous hymns—such is the one we await. He who steadfastly guards the True Unity: in a single year, his hair shall cease to whiten, and his bald pate shall sprout anew. Yet if inwardly he frets over descendants and household affairs, if outwardly he entangles himself in official duties and social obligations, if his senses are overtaxed and his qi dispersed by clamorous demands—then his Dao is not single-minded.*

*Further, he recounted the affairs of the Jade Axe’s cultivation, drawing a parallel to Xue Jihe, who failed the Seven Trials. Xue was the younger brother of Master Xue of Changli and the uncle of one who lost his rank through misconduct. Fond of the flute’s phoenix-like tones, Master Xue of Changli entreated the Most High on his behalf, that his life might be spared due to the hidden virtues of his ancestral line—virtues that might yet extend to Lord Jade Axe.*

*It is said that hearing the north wind stirs sorrow, while beholding the dawn’s radiance evokes peace; longing for swift steeds and admiring gentleness can transform melancholy—such is the heart of mortals. This is the innate resonance of one’s native winds, the inner stirrings of the homeland’s call. If you can trust in this, you shall attain harmony. But if you remain obstructed by timidity and ruled by desire, if the cinnabar and vermilion fail to flourish, then the perfected shall turn away empty-handed, and the lofty companions shall gather their sleeves and depart. The numinous darkness shall not abide in your dwelling, and the silent communion shall not stir your gaze. You shall be left to your own devices—how then can this not be lamentable?*

*Those who attain the Dao do so by shedding all burdens and advancing directly. Thus, the hundred affairs grow still, and worldly concerns scatter like clouds. What once troubled you shall no longer weary you; what once obstructed you shall serve to reveal your heart. In the first month, a guest from Tortoise Mountain shall arrive—your conduct as a worthy must be carefully considered.*

*From ancient times to the present, life and death have their ford; fame and obscurity diverge in their gatherings. To conceal the past and extinguish wisdom, to move with the world—these are the practices of those who attain the Dao. As for those who ingest the jade elixir once, who take flight thrice upon the ninefold radiance, who drink the cloudy nectar at dawn and wander amidst flowing yellow, who inhale golden essence and chew jade’s meaning—such ones ascend at once to ride the light and mount the void, ascending to the Great Mystery.*

*Yet when worldly affairs clash and this work remains unfinished, one must temporarily tread the Great Yin, concealing life in the dark realm. Cast off the outer form, abandon the physical husk, nurture the embryo in the empty dwelling, refine the blackness to seal the crucible, and receive the essence in the vast mystery. Thus, one transforms countenance in the coils of the Three Yin and alters the youthful visage at the gate of the Nine Refinements. Only then shall you know the preciousness of the divine immortals—deathless and undying, the comings and goings of existence, the profundity of its principle.*

*He who casts shade over ten thousand *mu* must emerge from the loftiest peaks; he who governs the heavens and shakes the summits must arise from the deepest abyss. How vast is the virtue of one who accumulates hidden merits, akin to the convergence of humanity! The carefree finned ones roam beyond the great wilderness, free from the woes of entanglement; the numinous wings soar toward the peaks of the Dark Garden, evading the snares of nets and cords. How can the cultivation of the Dao be arduous? It lies in the secrecy of concealing the self and the obscurity of erasing traces.*

*Moreover, the swiftest of fleet-footed creatures cannot gallop across Lüliang’s waters, nor can the most buoyant of boats traverse the heights of Mount Taihang—such are the differences in talent. Where dense forests once stood, feathered flocks now gather in clouds; where dark springs surge, scaled multitudes now compete—such is the flourishing of virtue.*

*Those who pursue the Dao must indeed endure hardship; those who endure hardship shall surely attain it. The student of the Dao must focus single-mindedly, directing true intent without distraction, thoughts stripped of excess, preserving purity and emptiness. If in secrecy you perceive clarity, if in stillness you attain realization, if you stand as though over a deep abyss, if you tread as though on thin ice—this is the gateway to attaining the Dao, though not yet its inner chamber.*

*It is said that studying the Dao is both exceedingly difficult and exceedingly easy. If you can dwell in tranquil mystery, savor profundity, preserve harmony and celestial truth, direct spirit to grasp the numinous, and immerse yourself in the Six Treasuries; if you can cherish darkness and restrain emotion, neither seeing nor hearing—this is the ease of studying the Dao. If you cannot practice these principles, then it is difficult. Moreover, when mountains and peaks are bound by turmoil, mighty birds cry out in the forests; when rivers and streams stagnate, dragons and rainbows grow somber in the marshes—such are the natural signs. If your inclinations and aversions violate principle, then the myriad winds shall blow discordantly.*

*Without stillness and compliance, there is no means to attain humility; without the empty handle, there is no means to achieve dark union. Let your thoughts be without deviation, and misfortune shall not befall you. Rectify the heart and cast off its burdens; clarify the source and purify the stream. If you journey south while your heart races north, if your words contradict your thoughts, if you discard the bitter herb to consume the poisonous leaf, if you scorn the ninefold harmony to delight in the vulgar—then I know you lack the discernment to harmonize with the true tone.*

*If you are obstructed by timidity and ruled by desire, if the cinnabar and vermilion fail to flourish, then the perfected shall turn away empty-handed, and the lofty companions shall gather their sleeves and depart. The numinous darkness shall not abide in your dwelling, and the silent communion shall not stir your gaze. You shall be left to your own devices—how then can this not be lamentable?"*

The Master thereupon advised Emperor Jianwen of Jin to wear a sachet of musk around his neck to ward off waterborne afflictions and nightmares.

The pursuit of the Dao lies in accumulating merit and piling up good deeds. The Perfected of the Great Void often said: "One who commits many transgressions yet does not repent bears sins that gather upon the body like rivers rushing to the sea, growing ever deeper and wider. If one recognizes evil, repents of wrongdoing, and turns toward goodness, sins diminish while virtue accumulates—thus may one attain the Dao. When others meet me with malice, I respond with kindness; when they bring me misfortune, I return it with blessing. Thus goodness ever resides within me. For the wicked to harm the good is like spitting toward the sky: the spittle does not defile the heavens but only soils the self. Wind scatters dust, yet the dust does not foul others but only shrouds oneself. The Dao cannot be destroyed; calamity must recoil upon the doer."

Moreover, feeding a hundred ordinary men is not equal to feeding one good man; feeding a thousand good men is not equal to feeding one who embraces the Dao in cold poverty. This is the secret teaching of the lofty Perfected, the essential precept of the Most High.

Wealth and sensual pleasures, in relation to the body, are like a child licking the honey on a blade’s edge: the honey is not enough to sweeten the mouth, yet there is the peril of a severed tongue. Beware! Of all the great desires that assail the will, none surpasses lust. Its transgressions know no bounds, its evils admit no pardon—how can one not guard against it?

The pursuit of the Dao lies in hidden virtue, in bestowing kindness and delivering salvation. Of all the uses of the will, none is greater than preserving the body. To serve the Dao brings vast fortune, and one’s life is firmly secured.

The Master recited a poem:
*"I drive my carriage through the eight voids,
Reveling in the bound halls of radiant splendor.
The Celestial Mother extends her pavilion for me to gaze,
As I chant aloud, treading the numinous wind.
I come as one who awaits an appointed time,
Thus I cross the azure waves."*

**First Stanza**
*"Soaring through the clouds’ resplendent traces,
I float my gaze above the rosy mists.
The auroral banners dance in crisscross flight,
The purple canopy upholds the sacred palace.
Crimson vapors coil in graceful twists,
Feathered robes fan the fragrant breeze.
Thunder roars as fierce beasts seize their prey,
Lightning hums as the dark dragon stirs.
The harmonious pipes blend in the courtyard’s song,
The golden chimes ring with divine resonance.
I pluck the magic herbs by the azure waves,
Gather the blossoms from the eightfold peaks.
My rosy countenance renews with each passing day,
As eons pass, I remain ever youthful."*

The Dao does not belong to oneself alone; without devoted practice, no merit is achieved.

**Second Stanza**
The true immortals, as a rule, are reclusive, dwelling in mountain forests, far from the world’s clamor, embracing simplicity. Thus their faces remain youthful, their temples dark. The jade nectar and golden elixir, the *jiaoli* fire dates—these are the medicines of ascension, not to be compared with the golden cinnabar.

Lord Ren’s body is not yet truly pure, and impure thoughts fill his heart; I fear such beings will not deign to come. If sincerity is not unified, the Dao remains impartial—this, too, is not fitting. Let us ask: has the *jiaoli* fire date tree already taken root in your heart? Even now, thorns and brambles mingle there—hence the two trees do not appear. I wonder if you can clear away ten thousand thorns to reveal this tree. When it grows alone, its fruit is most excellent. Though this is but a question, the desire for it is near. I shall ask the overseer on your behalf for three years, beginning today.

One who is empty and harmonious may guard the yang; one who is serene and desolate may guard the yin. Knowing the white, one may guard the black. "Serene and desolate" refers to solitary wandering in the single radiance. Within your Crimson Palace, can you open the empty gate and ascend to the highest clouds’ mystic verge?

The Dao is easy to hear but suffers from lack of sincerity; scriptures are easy to obtain but suffer from lack of practice. If one were wholly devoted thus, all within the great heavens would stand shoulder to shoulder as true immortals. I bear no fault toward those who cannot achieve this. If the heart is unsettled yet one desires to write, will one seek to sell it? If the mind does not turn toward the truth yet one seeks the real, will one grasp at mere appearances?

This was conveyed to Director Xu on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, along with a poem describing the Jade Terrace Grand Assembly on the Autumn Equinox. The Great Lord of the Azure Youth and the Four Lords each chanted true verses to harmonize with the celestial zither’s vast and radiant strings.

The Lord of the Azure Youth chanted:
*"To plant the root of extinction,
One must uproot the seeds of life and death.
Sighing, one sinks into the nine springs,
All for clinging to this bodily form."*

The Perfected of the Great Void chanted:
*"Behold the spirit bearing its form—
It rides in carriage and on horse.
When the carriage breaks and the horse bolts,
All is but a fleeting loan.
Few in this world recognize this,
Yet it is merely the ceasing of wind and fire.
Sowing sins in the heavenly net,
One reaps poison in the hells below."*

The Perfected Lord Wang of the Western City chanted:
*"The spirit is the boat that ferries the form;
When it docks at the shore, they must part.
The form is not the spirit’s eternal abode,
The spirit is not the form’s eternal bearer.
Wavering between life and death,
One suffers from indecision."*

The Perfected Lord Wang of the Lesser Existence chanted:
*"Losing the Dao, one follows the ford of death;
The three souls wander, lost from the path of life.
With each passing day, life grows more distant,
With each passing day, death draws nearer.
Alas! The face of bitter sorrow—
The root and flower are already overturned.
Rising to sit among the withered and fallen,
How can one know the return to withered age?"*

The Master also bestowed poems upon Lord Xu:

**First Stanza**
*"The profound Dao is hard to fathom,
Its subtle mysteries difficult to exhaust.
Lord Xu is such a man—
The radiant sun ascends the hill.
Soaring beyond the rosy glow,
His body flies amid the nine heavens.
By his conduct, the host of Perfected gather,
In the golden towers, he tends the seed-people."*

**Second Stanza**
*"His virtue is benevolent and harmonious,
His teachings upright and mild.
He may be called the flower of heaven,
His elegance revered by later generations.
Nurturing his form in quiet mountain fastness,
The seven spirits commune of themselves.
The dusty world brings sorrow and lament,
Causing my white temples to droop.
Long have I sighed in dark obscurity,
Regretting not having fled sooner."*

**Third Stanza**
*"I halt my carriage, watching the moon’s slow course,
Turning my reins back toward the azure waves.
Not yet have I beheld such a one’s wanderings,
Yet in idle thought, I wonder how he fares.
Awaiting the good cause of verdant spring,
I forget the cares within my breast."*

**Fourth Stanza**
*"Guiding the dawn, I float upon purple mists,
Gazing upon the eightfold radiant streams.
Feathered youths bear chalices of jade nectar,
Jade blossoms offer lush delicacies.
We pledge ourselves by the white waters’ shore,
Raising my years’ rosary of pearls."*

**Fifth Stanza**
*"The azure chambers gleam with bound radiance,
The purple vault floats in the crimson dawn.
The twin virtues hold fast to the Dao’s essence,
Establishing the true lords’ domain.
The eight terraces may be glimpsed in passing,
Northward, the Primordial soars in flight.
Gazing from the clouds’ midst in purity,
Vast and distant, I tread the shifting light.
Inhaling the peaks’ verdant splendor,
Concealing my brilliance in the eastern hills."*

**Fifth Stanza**
Long have I dwelt amidst mortal affairs,
Each day devoid of leisure’s span.
How could it compare to seeking the true form,
And returning to the visage of a child?

**Sixth Stanza**
At dawn’s gate, the great rosy clouds are woven,
Jade chambers rise in the limpid heavens.
I grasp the three wondrous visions,
Floating radiance soars through the utmost void.
Cinnabar blossoms exist in empty space,
Golden towers nurture the essence of vitality.
The eight winds stir embroidered banners,
Verdant trees illuminate the four numina.
The floral canopy is steeped in orchid’s glow,
Purple reins urge the green plow.
Pledging faith to commune with spirits,
All things respond with celestial sincerity.
Why seek external phenomena’s stirrings?
One must behold the jade and crystal splendor.

**Seventh Stanza**
The three radiant scenes flourish in mystic lushness,
Heaven’s light illumines the eight directions.
Crimson clouds drift above the lofty palace,
Carefree, I ride the numinous wind.
Beating my wings, I mount the pristine gale,
Refining my gaze within the jasper terrace.
The green canopy enters the harmonious dawn,
The azure disk is cast into the empty sky.
To the right, I bow to the Eastern Grove’s Lord,
Ascending to court the Supreme Void’s Sovereign.
Jade guests partake of phoenix-brain incense,
Roaming in intoxication with flying elixir draughts.
Cloud hooks turn the winding chambers,
A thousand tones—how resonant they ring!
The brocade-clad summons fierce beasts,
Fragrant musk sways in graceful ascent.
The perfume mother bends in song,
Purple mist arrays the rafters’ beams.
I gather the reins at the lofty pure gate,
Loosening my chariot in the fair one’s chamber.
In former cycles, no omen arose,
Spiritual transformations soar with qi’s flight.
My heart, distant, senses the mystic shore,
Years pass with accumulated reverence.
If form delights in foul and fragrant,
Movement and stillness lose the azure waves.
Yet my friends are not thus—
Glory and disgrace were forgotten long ago.

**Eighth Stanza**
The crimson radiance floats in the dark dawn,
The purple chariot rides the misty journey.
Gazing upward, I transcend the green gate’s bounds,
Looking down, I chant over the vermilion fire city.
The eastern glow unfurls its vast brilliance,
Divine light illumines the seven numina.
Shade and light ripple with the three torches,
Flowing freely, I equal the void.
Wind coils through the hollow cosmos,
Fragrant tones arise with each rhythm’s touch.
Hand in hand, I dance with the Maid of Recognition,
Together we pluck the gourd in the courtyard.
To the left, I circle the azure feathered banner,
The floral canopy follows the clouds’ tilt.
I repose beyond the ninefold bounds,
Right and wrong no longer occupy my mind.
Embracing the true, I grasp the Great Stillness,
My golden form grows ever more youthful.
How could it resemble the defiled midst,
Where life is bleak and without solace?

**Ninth Stanza**
With triple reins, I guide the purple chariot,
Tipping the clouds toward the Eastern Grove’s slope.
Four standards gleam in the bright sky,
The vermilion carriage flies to the numinous mound.
The jade canopy is steeped in the seven radiant scenes,
Beating my wings, I float above the heavens.
Nine tones resound through the purple void,
Jade echoes reverberate through the Great Primal.
Feasting and chanting in the Three Dawn Palaces,
Singing and calling to my companions.
Unaware that the trunk has aged,
How could I know the two luminaries’ flow?
Though the fair one is nearly forgotten,
A hundred cares remain unreleased.
The long forest is truly serene,
In the cliffs, many find their own joy.

**Tenth Stanza**
Northward, I ascend the Gate of Mystic Truth,
Hand in hand, we weave the lofty net.
Fragrant smoke scatters the eight radiant scenes,
The mystic wind stirs the crimson waves.
Gazing upward, I transcend the Jasper Garden’s ford,
Looking down, I tread the Cloudy Mound’s slope.
Jade flutes play above the clouds,
Phoenixes sing through the ninefold distances.
Riding the dark, I float through the Great Void—
Why should I tread upon mountains and rivers?
With golden tablets, I command the feathered spirits,
Leading the hosts to vanquish the myriad demons.
Together we embrace the twin luminaries’ glow,
A thousand springs yet lie in infancy.
Losing the true, one plunges into the hall of strife—
Helpless, what can be done?

**Eleventh Stanza**
I gaze upward to the Palace of Great Rosy Clouds,
Golden chambers gleam in the purple clarity.
The floral chambers reflect the Great Simplicity,
Four chariots are all of vermilion jade.
I cast the wheel into the hollow ford,
Gathering the reins to dance the green plow.
Jade blossoms fly like snowflakes,
The Western Consort wields the brocade banner.
Though I dwell at the dusty and turbid shore,
I yearn for the fair one’s courtyard.
The night’s resonance summons the Perfected to descend,
The one I beckon already dwells in the unseen.
Riding the wind, I play the dawn’s hymn,
Together we intoxicate ourselves with cinnabar and jade nectar.
Lords and marquises, how distant they seem—
How could they know the Perfected’s numen?

**Twelfth Stanza**
At dawn’s light, I bow to the crimson clouds,
Gathering the dark to roam above the heavens.
Circling the plow, I tread the winding waves,
Thus I witness the world’s sorrows.
Words and intent arise in solemn density,
Unscattered like the threefold blossoms’ fragrance.
How could it compare to wandering the mystic realm,
Stroking the zither for your delight?
You may rest in what has bounds,
I wish for what lies within the boundless.

**Thirteenth Stanza**
Reining the radiance, I ascend the dawn’s heavens,
Roaming and feasting in the Azure Waves’ Palace.
Colored clouds entwine the cinnabar clouds,
Numinous mists scatter through the eight skies.
The Supreme Perfected chant in the jasper chambers,
The lofty immortals sing in the jade halls.
Nine phoenixes sing the vermilion pipes,
Hollow reeds harmonize with feathered bells.
Exchanging handles within the Golden Court,
I bind my true companions within.
Together we embrace the jade nectar’s ford—
In an instant, we are already youths.
Why should one crouch upon the path?
Transgressions and faults grow with the days.

**Fourteenth Stanza**
At dawn, I roam the Palace of Great Simplicity,
Guiding the plow to gaze upon the Jade River.
At dusk, I feast in the secluded chamber,
At dawn, I gather the round radiance’s blossoms.
I strum and sing upon the Northern Cold Terrace,
The seven numina shine with purple clouds.
Majestic immortals rise in solemn ranks,
While the dust-bound weave their tangled nets.
I linger amidst the clamor and mist,
Transgressions and burdens should not be many.

**Fifteenth Stanza**
Driving the dark, I race the cloud plow,
At dawn, I ascend the Great Stillness Mound.
The crimson ford connects the trembling peaks,
Clear waves surge in the rushing flow.
I pace the void to observe the nine wefts—
The eight principles have all been traversed.
Briefly feasting on the three golden blossoms,
I come to observe those who stand with resolve.
Diligence and laxity do not conceal one another—
Thus, a hundred cares accumulate.

**Sixteenth Stanza**
Treading the waves, I cross the azure waves,
Suddenly arriving at the Golden Mountain.
Gazing in all four directions, I wander the day,
Rare are those who meet me amidst the clouds.

**Seventeenth Stanza**
Purple gates are built above the void,
Mystic halls embrace the utmost gale.
Jewels and jasper adorn the numinous gardens,
Blossoms bloom, forming jade and crystal.
I race the plow through the Azure Waves’ ford,
The eight winds stir the cloudy melodies.
Parting the feathered fans of the northern shade,
Grasping the tablets, I sound the golden flutes.
Phoenix pipes harmonize with a thousand bells,
Western youths sing the morning court.
My heart opens beyond the Void’s Origin,
My spirit’s lapel—how bright and boundless!
Turning to dance upon the Great Void’s ridge,
The six darks revolve through profound depths.
Could my path be sought?
It ensures you will not wither to the end.

**Eighteenth Stanza**
The dark waves surge as azure waves,
Vast fords stir the myriad streams.
Driving the radiance, I traverse the six voids,
Longing to wander with the fair one.
Exquisite songs do not answer me—
With whom shall I share these pure tones?
Racing jade chariots amidst the clouds,
Why should I be a companion in the dust?

**Nineteenth Stanza**
Pines and cypresses grow on the dark ridge,
Flourishing as the cold forest’s finest.
Luxuriant branches thrive in the bitter frost,
Unwilling to fear the white snow.
In troubled times, they dwell in the deep ravines,
Yet their lives remain pure as the Dao’s constancy.
I fly this swift chariot’s wheel,
Following the distant one’s tracks.

**Nineteenth Stanza**
Nobles and lords may come and go—
Why then can I not sever ties?

**Twentieth Stanza**
In purity I long for Eastern Mountain,
Where the sun’s essence anchors in the numinous cavern.
I cherish the quiet of an empty courtyard,
Shaded by verdant, dense timber.
The full radiance gleams upon the southern pavilion,
While crimson winds fan the secluded chamber.
With sleeves clasped in the tranquil room,
We pledge to master the wondrous arts.
Vast and bright, my thoughts reach the profound,
As my spirit soars in desolate ease.

**Twenty-First Stanza**
If words are lodged, they must be heeded—
To ignore them is heartless indeed.
How might I follow the traces of the revered,
To seek this spirit of the empty void?
Subtle tones bear deep meaning—
Guard them well, do not treat them lightly.
In all things, respond to the divine mechanism,
And you shall behold great peace.

**Twenty-Second Stanza**
The reins of light descend to the azure waves,
Leaping across the ford of the Blue Sea.
Crimson mists swirl beneath the sun,
As feathered canopies tilt the nine heavens.
Cloud chariots drift through the hollow void,
Swiftly skimming the dark billows.
I come to seek a true companion,
To attend the Celestial Dawn together.
The princely son harmonizes with luminous virtue,
Joining ranks to summon the jade sages.
Below, we rein in the Eight River Palace;
Above, we rest upon the peaks of the Radiant Grove.
Sipping this purple jade nectar,
Only then do I know the bitterness of the sullied path.
Where now does the fair one dwell?
Diligence alone brings intimacy.

**Twenty-Third Stanza**
Crimson gates part the boundless skies,
As I don vermilion and ascend the hall of light.
Purple banners ripple through clouds and rosy dawn,
While feathered immortals dance to the eight winds.
Halting the canopy, I bathe in the emerald stream,
Gathering blossoms from the Moon-Sustaining Peak.
I chew the three numinous flowers,
Drawing in the nine divine rays.
Countless kalpas stretch without end,
Aligning with the sun to nurture the young and pure.
With sleeves gathered, I enter the Hall of Luminous Truth,
Gazing upward to await the Primordial Sovereign.
At the northern pole, the feathered ones sing,
As the dark mystery gathers the wise in chorus.
Why do the waves of the world’s realm
Weigh gain and loss upon me?
I crane my neck within the clamorous court,
Opening my heart to dispel the foul miasma.
To grow accustomed to the realm of glory and disgrace,
Rarely does one tread the Radiant Grove’s palace.
Is a single moment of stillness worth such suffering?
Go forth and gaze upon the azure waves.

**Twenty-Fourth Stanza**
The world treasures fragrant and flourishing unions,
While the Dao’s lineage convenes in the mystic heavens.
Shaking my robes, I seek true companions,
Turning my chariot at the edge of the windblown dust.
Virtue shines with dark radiance,
And outstanding talents gather in splendid array.
Secret words bring abundant blessings,
While tranquility and emptiness exalt the true and noble.
Ever should the two images be followed in harmony,
Hand in hand, bound as kin.
Why inquire of worldly affairs?
For therein lies the daily rise of calamity and harm.

**Twenty-Fifth Stanza**
When the Lady first descended to expound these verses, she urged all the more earnestly the cultivation of the Dao, for she feared that faltering midway would bring even graver misfortune. Her admonitions and warnings were directed to Master Xu and Jade Axe, both inscribed in the registers of immortals, that they might daily advance in profound virtue and ascend ever higher in the ranks of the true. She recounted how the Green Lad had exhorted seekers of the Dao to uproot the bonds of love and desire as one would pluck a hanging pearl—each plucked, they would naturally be exhausted. She also spoke of oxen and horses burdened with heavy loads, sinking deeper into the mire with each step; likewise, the Daoist’s heart, clinging to worldly desires, must swiftly cast them off, gazing upon those beasts in the mud and longing for their respite.

One who reads the Daoist scriptures and savors the flavor of cultivation is like one feasting on fine delicacies—all six viscera are sated, and the aftertaste lingers. Those who practice thus shall attain the Dao.

The Purple Prime Lady also addressed the Lady, saying: The Perfected Ones declare that there are five difficulties in the world—poverty makes almsgiving hard; great wealth makes learning the Dao hard; controlling fate to escape death is hard; obtaining and beholding the cavern scriptures is hard; and being born in the *renchen* era of a sagely age is hard.

I once heard from the Great Dao Lord: To know the formless origin of the Dao and virtue is of no benefit—what matters is to guard one’s resolve and practice the Dao. It is like polishing a mirror: when the grime is removed and clarity remains, one’s own form is revealed. Sever the six passions, guard emptiness and stillness, and the true nature of the Dao will be seen, allowing one to know one’s past lives.

The Dark Purity Lady said: Worldly people are beset by the cares of wives, children, and households more grievously than by prison, for while prison offers the hope of pardon, the snares of wives and children—though fraught with the peril of tiger’s jaws—are still embraced willingly. Their sins admit no absolution. Thus they are called "family burdens," for they entangle the self, preventing carefree wandering. Yet people do not know to sever love, cast off burdens, purify the heart for the Dao, and preserve the body.

At the assembly where Master Yang descended in communion with the true spirits, ten ladies were present, each bearing a title yet lacking biographical records. Their songs and verses are recorded here in full: the Supreme Harmony Spirit Concubine, Left Lady of the Upper Realms; the Dark Purity Lady of the Six Subtleties of the Northern Sea; the Right Lady of the Seven Spirits of Northern Han; the Right Lady of the Central Florescence of the Great Ultimate; the Eight Spirits Dao Mother, Lady Jiang of the Western Marchmount; the Upper Real Guardian Lady of the Eastern Palace; the Concubine Guan of the Northern Absolute Terrace of Vermilion Numinance; the Upper Real Mountain Lady of the Northern Marchmount; the Lady of Western Han; and Lady Du of Changling. On that night, twenty-three perfected ones and fifteen ladies descended upon the golden altar in Master Yang’s home.

**Infant Mother**
Infant Mother, surnamed Chen, styled Riying, was of unknown origin. During the Western Jin dynasty, she resided at Huangtang Abbey in Danyang Prefecture. Having cultivated the supreme Dao for many years, she remained unchanged in appearance from youth to old age—her hair and complexion unaltered—so that the people called her "Infant Mother." Once, in the market of Wu, she encountered a boy of fourteen or fifteen who knelt before her, saying, "I should be your son." She replied, "You are young—where do you come from? To call me mother is beyond my understanding. I dare not consent. How could we depend on each other?" Sighing, she departed. A month later, she again met a child of three in the market of Wu, who seemed lost and wept all night. When she saw him, he clung to her robe and refused to leave. Those who witnessed this urged her to take him in and raise him as her own. As he grew, he displayed extraordinary intelligence and filial piety, surpassing ordinary people. From the age of maturity, his bearing was noble and outstanding, and wherever he dwelled, strange clouds and dark radiance often appeared around his topknot and beard. He attended his mother closely, speaking of Penglai and Yufeng, which she found remarkable. She said to him, "Our bond is but temporary. By what name should you be called?" The youth replied, "Formerly, the Heavenly Perfected bestowed upon me sacred scriptures and granted me the title and rank of Filial Dao Radiant King. Now you may address me as such." He then taught his mother the secrets of cultivating the true Dao: "Always refine yourself on the lofty and mysterious terrace; sever all ties with the base and idle. Ingest the harmonious yang, still the tranquil mystery, and entrust the garden to the Mirror of the Great Void and the Non-Ultimate." The Yellow Emperor’s son and Laozi’s jade scripture, the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, along with the Dao of the Seven Origins of Vastness and the Hidden Mystery of the Supreme, enable one to ride a light canopy with the companions of flowing rosy clouds, to coil the lunar essence upon the Terrace of Wenchang, and to attain this Dao. Then the nine phoenixes will sing in unison, startling the heavens with celestial music; refining the body and mastering the eight effulgences, one floats through the void; dragon chariots and tiger escorts roam the eight directions. You should treasure this." One day, the Filial Dao Radiant King vanished without a trace. Infant Mother secretly practiced the great method for decades, unknown to others. Later, Wu Meng and Xu Xun of Wu traveled south from Songyang to visit her, seeking the transmission of the Dao she had attained. She bound them in covenant and transmitted it to them, and the method of the Filial Dao spread throughout the Jiang region.

In her leisure, Infant Mother told her two disciples, "The world says I was Xu Xun’s teacher. Now, in the Jade Emperor’s register of the mysterious, Meng holds the office of Censor, while Xun is the Illustrious Grand Envoy, overseeing the celestial records. Their ranks have advanced. Moreover, they govern the twelve earthly branches, each assigned to one of the twelve states: Xun presides over the Dark Ridge Wilderness, corresponding to *zi* (the first branch), while Meng rules the Star Chronicle State, corresponding to *chou* (the second branch). Xu’s position is elevated above Wu, ascending the ranks of the immortal hierarchy." Several years later, clouds and dragons arrived with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to welcome her. Chen Mother ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Today, in Gao’an County, Hongzhou, forty *li* to the east, stands Huangtang Altar, where Master Xu established a shrine to venerate the Sacred Mother. Records of her ascension remain in Danyang Prefecture. Later, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Xuanzong of the Great Tang, the shrine in Zhongling was renamed Chen Mother. The method of the Filial Dao differs slightly from that of the Numinous Treasure, yet the people of Yuzhang have practiced it for generations.

How grand is human conduct! Nothing surpasses filial piety. He who is filial to his parents will be loyal to his lord; he who governs his household well will bring peace to his state. Filial piety moves heaven and earth, stirs ghosts and spirits, enriches human relations, beautifies education, transforms customs, purifies the eight wilds, and rectifies the hundred norms. Can anything aid the Dao and magnify transformation more than filial piety? Thus, the method of the Filial Dao descended from the Supreme Mystery and flourished in the Jin dynasty, enduring in the customs of Yuzhang to this day. Therefore, Master Xu ascended to heaven with his entire household and was entrusted with governing the states—all through the power of filial devotion.

**Lady Hook-and-Trigger**
Lady Hook-and-Trigger was a native of Qi, surnamed Zhao.

Lady Hook-and-Trigger favored purity from a young age. She suffered an illness for six years, during which her left hand remained clenched in a fist and could not be opened. A diviner gazing into the dark declared, "In the northeast there is a noblewoman of black aura." Upon seeking her out, she was summoned to court, where her beauty and bearing were extraordinary. Emperor Wu of Han pried open her hand and found a jade hook within; her hand soon relaxed. He then favored her, and she bore Emperor Zhao. Emperor Wu later had her put to death. When her body was laid in state, it emitted fragrance for a full month though it did not decay. After Emperor Zhao ascended the throne, he had her reburied, but her coffin contained only a pair of silk slippers. Thus, her palace was named "Hook-and-Trigger," later renamed the "Temple of Dai" to avoid taboo. Whenever sacrifices were offered there, a spirit was often seen seated within the temple hall.

**The Two Consorts of the Xiang River**
The Two Consorts of the Xiang River were the wives of Shun. The elder was named Ehuang, the younger Nüying.

Long ago, when Yao, wearied by age and the burdens of the realm, sought to yield the throne, he extolled the virtue of the worthy and the reclusive. Xu You, Chao Fu, Shan Juan, and others fled to avoid him. Turning to the humble and obscure, he found the widower Yu Shun, whose filial virtue was renowned. Yao raised him to office and betrothed his two daughters to him to observe his inner conduct, subjecting him to manifold trials to test his outward bearing. Thereafter, Shun did not lose his way in the great wilderness, and all craftsmen were well-ordered. Yao entrusted him with the regency for twenty-eight years before passing away. Shun observed three years of mourning before ascending the throne at the age of sixty-one. He reigned for fifty-one more years, living to the age of one hundred and twelve. On a southern inspection tour to the wilds of Cangwu, he lodged at the home of the Marquis of He. The Five Elders of the Supreme Thearch descended in a jade carriage drawn by cloud-banners and feathered canopies to welcome Shun, who then ascended to heaven and did not return. The Marquis of He also ascended with his entire household.

At the time, the two consorts were at the foot of the mountain. They sought Shun but could not find him. Gazing at the nine peaks, each resembling the others, they knew not where Shun had gone. Weeping as they looked upon the peaks, they wiped their tears on the cliffside bamboo, which became speckled. Seeing each peak, they suspected Shun was upon it, and thus the mountain was named the Nine Doubts. Later, their sincerity moved heaven and earth, and they too attained immortality. The people of the time believed they had drowned in the Xiang River, and so a shrine was established for them. Within the shrine, the positions of the Xiang Lord and the Xiang Lady were arranged in order of seniority, with Ehuang as the Xiang Lord and Nüying as the Xiang Lady—these were not separate deities.

On autumn nights by the Xiang River and the Nine Doubts, the celestial music of the *Shaoyao* is sometimes heard. This is because Shun, governing above in the Purple Tenuity and presiding below over this mountain, is always accompanied by heavenly music wherever he travels. The ethereal sounds resound through the void, and the common folk mistakenly call this "the Xiang Spirit playing the zither." It is also a misconception that the two consorts were Yao’s daughters.

Now, according to the *Imperial Genealogy*: The Yellow Thearch was known as the Thearch of the Grand Ancestry, a descendant of the Ji clan and son of Shaodian. Some say he was of the Shaodian clan, others of the Gongsun clan, and his name was Xuanyuan. When the age of Shennong declined, the feudal lords rebelled in resentment, and Chiyou wrought havoc, harming the living. The Yellow Thearch, rising from the state of Youxiong to aid the mandate, ascended the imperial throne. He vanquished Chiyou, executed the descendants of the Jiang clan, and pacified the realm. The Yellow Thearch’s son was named Zhi, who succeeded him as the Thearch Shaohao, also called the Thearch of Metal Heaven. Shaohao’s son was Zhuanxu, Zhuanxu’s son was Diku, Diku’s son was Yao, known as the Taotang clan, named Fangxun. Thus, Yao was the great-grandson of the Yellow Thearch and the fifth-generation descendant of Zhuanxu, making him Shun’s second cousin once removed. Yao’s daughters would have been Shun’s second cousins once removed—Yao would not have betrothed his daughters to Shun. This is likely an error in the historical records. It must be that Yao, wishing to test Shun’s virtue, betrothed his two daughters to him, and the historians recorded it as such. It was not that Yao’s daughters were married to Shun.

Ehuang and Nüying were not of the Ji clan. Moreover, "Shun" was not a posthumous title. The system of posthumous titles began with the Duke of Zhou, who established it to praise or censure rulers and ministers, setting a precedent for admonition and encouragement. Later generations applied it retroactively, saying, "The excellent and virtuous transmit sagacity, hence Yao." This refers to Yao’s elevation of Shun from obscurity, his abdication of the throne, and the beauty of his abdication, which has been revered through the ages—hence the posthumous title. The character "Shun" in the system of posthumous titles means "benevolent, sagely, flourishing, and bright." This too was a posthumous designation. Why? According to the *Book of Documents*, when Yao was about to yield the throne, he said, "Ah, you Four Peaks, I have occupied the throne for seventy years. Can you follow the mandate and yield the throne to me?" The Peaks replied, "No, our virtue is unworthy of the imperial position." Yao said, "Promote the worthy and raise the obscure; let the teachers instruct the Thearch." They said, "There is a widower below, named Yu Shun." Yao said, "Yes, what have I heard of him?" The Peaks replied, "The son of a blind man, his father was obstinate, his mother deceitful, his younger brother arrogant, yet he harmonized with them through filial piety." Yao said, "Let me test him. I will send down my two daughters to the bend of the Gui River to be consorts to Yu." Yao said, "Be reverent!" Thus, Yao merely sent his two daughters to be consorts to Shun to observe his inner virtue. Whether they were taken from the palace or from among the people, it is clear they were not Yao’s daughters married to Shun.

After the First Emperor of Qin burned the books, scholars scattered to escape calamity, and historical records were lost or incomplete. Fu Sheng of Jinan transmitted them orally, and errors may have arisen without means of verification. The title "Shun" originated during his lifetime as a commoner, not as a posthumous title, as in the cases of Fuxi, Shennong, Diku, and Zhuanxu. Those of keen understanding should examine this further.

**The Dark Consort of the Luo River**
The Dark Consort of the Luo River was the daughter of the Dark Oxen clan. She attained the Dao and became a water immortal, presiding over the Luo River. She often roamed the Luo’s waters, taking the female immortals as her companions, finding delight in their gatherings. Sometimes she manifested in wondrous forms, much like the morning clouds and evening rain.

**The Rhapsody of the Luo Goddess**

When Cao Zhi, Prince of Yongqiu in Wei, was moved by Song Yu’s dialogue with the King of Chu, he composed *The Rhapsody of the Luo Goddess* in homage, describing her form thus:

*"Graceful as a startled swan in flight, supple as a wandering dragon at play. Radiant as autumn chrysanthemums in bloom, luxuriant as spring pines in their prime. Her coiled tresses billow like light clouds veiling the sun; her robes flutter as though borne by the wind through drifting mist. Bright as the morning sun ascending the dawn clouds, resplendent as lotus leaves rising from green waves. Her body swift and luminous, fleeting as a spirit; she treads the ripples with delicate steps, and dust stirs beneath her silk-stockinged feet."*

Such are the embellished words of a literary scholar. Yet those who attain the Dao and ascend to true transcendence occupy a realm far beyond mortal reach—where the chasm between immortals and men is vast, and manifestations rare. How could such an encounter compare to Song Yu’s lascivious verses, which merely summoned a fleeting glimpse of a celestial being?

Consider Feng Yi, who ingested rainbow cinnabar to become a water immortal and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of the River. Or the daughter of the Zhenmeng clan, who obtained the Dark Pearl of the Yellow Emperor and presided over the records of the Tuo and Min rivers. And Hao Jie’e, who consumed the jade elixir and ascended to the lunar palace. These are not merely because water is the abode of the Great Yin and governed by female immortals, but rather the offices and ranks they were destined to hold.

Lu, the young master, consumed water jade to become the Earl of the River, while Tian Hao ingested mica to become a water deity—proof that male immortals, too, may serve in aquatic offices.

Feng Yi, devoted to the Dao, encountered Master Juan, who bestowed upon him rainbow cinnabar. After consuming it, he became a water immortal and was granted the title of River Marquis. The daughter of the Zhenmeng clan—also known as the clan of Qi Xiang—obtained the essence of the Yellow Emperor’s Dark Pearl and became a water immortal, ruling over the sources of the Min and Tuo rivers.

Hao Jie’e was the wife of Yi, the archer who guarded the Yellow Emperor’s palace. She entered the palace, obtained the cinnabar of the jade elixir, and shared it with Jie’e. Together, they flew to the lunar palace, where she became an official of the moon.

Moreover, the Five Peaks, Ten Mountains, Nine Rivers, and Eight Marshes all possess immortal bureaus and numinous courts, overseeing the merits, transgressions, blessings, and misfortunes of the mortal world. They also govern the treasures of mountains and rivers, sacred herbs, and divine fungi, or preside over grotto-heavens, true scriptures, and jade registers. Their appointments are not fixed—some last five hundred years, others a thousand—before they are reassigned. The mysteries of the dark and true are veiled, unknown to the world.

**The Maiden of Yangdu**

The Maiden of Yangdu was the daughter of a wine merchant in Yangdu. From birth, she bore an extraordinary appearance: her eyebrows stretched to her ears, long and delicate. The townsfolk marveled, suspecting she was a celestial being.

At the time, there was a black mountain immortal named Duzi, a native of Ye. He dwelled on Black Mountain, gathering pine nuts and *fuling* mushrooms, which he consumed to sustain himself. He had lived for centuries, his true name forgotten. He often rode a yellow calf, earning the nickname "Calf Master." His form shifted—sometimes youthful, sometimes aged, sometimes ugly, sometimes fair. He frequented the wine shop in Yangdu, and the maiden, enamored, served him devotedly.

One day, she followed Duzi to gather peaches. They returned after a single night, bearing an abundance of fruit—sweet, fragrant, and unlike ordinary peaches. The townspeople, spying their departure, seized the calf’s ears and fled, their speed like flight, impossible to pursue. Yet soon after, the pair reappeared in the marketplace for decades. Later, both vanished, though some claimed to have seen them beneath Mount Pan, selling peaches in winter.

As *The Selections of Refined Literature* states: *"The calf paired with the maiden of joined brows."*

**Du Lanxiang**

Du Lanxiang’s origins are unknown. A fisherman on Dongting Lake in the Xiang River supported himself by angling. One day, he heard a child’s wails on the lake’s shore. Looking around, he saw no one—only a three-year-old girl lying nearby. Moved by pity, he took her home and raised her. Over a decade later, she grew into a woman of extraordinary beauty, her countenance luminous and divine, like a celestial maiden.

Suddenly, a youthful immortal descended from the heavens and entered their home. He carried the girl away, saying to the fisherman as he ascended: *"I am the immortal Du Lanxiang. I was exiled to the mortal realm for a transgression, but my term has ended, and I must depart."* With that, he vanished into the sky. Thereafter, she occasionally returned home.

Later, Lanxiang descended upon the household of Zhang Shuo on Baoshan in Dongting. Zhang was a cultivator of the Dao. For three years, she taught him the way of bodily ascension and transformation, and he, too, attained immortality. When she first arrived, she left behind a jade tablet, a jade spittoon, and a red fire-woven cloth as tokens of her transcendence.

One evening, she commanded her attendant to present Zhang with garments of yellow scales, feathered slippers, crimson shoes, a dark crown, and a crane-feather cloak, along with a cinnabar-jade pendant and a spirit sword. *"These are the raiments of the highest immortals,"* she said, *"not found in grotto-heavens."* Zhang Shuo’s celestial rank remains unrecorded, and the details are lost to history.

The fisherman, too, grew younger with age, often abstaining from food. He wandered the rivers and lakes, studying the Dao, until his whereabouts became unknown.

**Xu Mother**
Xu Mother was a native of Yuzhang. Outwardly, she blended with the world, but inwardly, she cultivated the essential truths of the Dao. She once said, *"A thousand years ago, I dwelled on West Mountain. When the burdens of the world grow light, I shall return to the realm of perfection."* Her son, named Lie and styled Daowei, lost his father in youth and served his mother with such filial devotion that his reputation spread far. Though his hair turned gray prematurely and his face bore the marks of toil, he provided for his impoverished family with unwavering care, ensuring no want went unmet. The villagers held him in high esteem.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Western Jin, Wu Meng and Xu Xun of the same commandery diligently cultivated the Dao, their practices resonating with the numinous. They dwelled on Hongya Mountain, where they built an altar and established a sacred precinct. After Wu Meng’s departure, Xu Xun employed talismans and true scriptures to deliver the people and save the world, earning reverence far and wide. Xu Xun served as a record-keeper in the prefecture but returned home every new and full moon to pay homage. Some witnessed him riding a dragon to and fro, the distance traversed as swift as a hand’s span.

Xu was steadfast in loyalty and sincerity, and Master Xu entrusted him with responsibilities. He and his mother built a thatched hut eighty paces northeast of Xu’s residence. Each day at dusk, he attended to Xu, his devotion unwavering. His mother often gathered flowers and fruits from the mountainside to offer to Xu, who, moved by her sincerity, wished to deliver and transcend her.

In the second year of Emperor Hui’s reign, the *renzi* year (292 CE), on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Supreme Lord commanded Cui Wenzi, the Jade Perfected Duke, and Xia Qiuzhong, the Perfected of Great Mystery, to confer upon Xu the title of *Supreme Envoy of the Nine Provinces, Illustrious Lord of the Dao*. A cloud chariot with feathered canopies bore him aloft in broad daylight. Xu said to Daowei and his mother, *"I have received the Supreme Emperor’s mandate and may not linger. You may follow me in ascension on another day."* Overcome with grief and joy, mother and son prostrated themselves, pleading to accompany him. Xu consented, bestowing upon them elixirs to consume and personally imparting the true oral instructions. At noon, they ascended with Xu, and the altar and well remain to this day. The villagers dared not adorn or embellish the site, honoring Xu’s mother and son for their frugality. Thus, it became known as *Xu Mother’s Altar Precinct*.

**Nine Heavens Mystic Woman**
The Nine Heavens Mystic Woman was the teacher of the Yellow Emperor and a disciple of the Sage Mother, the Primordial Sovereign. The Yellow Emperor ruled the land of Youxiong, assisting Shennong in governance. After Shennong’s grandson Yugang declined, the feudal lords waged war incessantly, their banners clashing daily. Each claimed dominion under the names of the Five Phases: the descendants of Taihao styled themselves the Bluegreen Emperor, Yugang’s lineage the Red Emperor, the clan of Gonggong the White Emperor, the heirs of Getian the Black Emperor, and the Yellow Emperor, rising from the lands of Youxiong, took his name accordingly.

The Yellow Emperor humbled himself, revered scholars, and cultivated virtue. After twenty-two years on the throne, Chiyou wrought havoc—his eighty-one brothers, beast-bodied and human-tongued, with copper heads and iron brows, spewing sand and devouring stones, consuming no grain. They assumed the forms of tigers to harm the common folk, forging weapons on Gelu Mountain, defying the Emperor’s decree. The Emperor sought to subdue them, gathering the worthy to his aid. He found Fenghou by the sea, Limu in the great marsh, appointed Dahong as his assistant, and Tianlao as his teacher. He established the Three Dukes to mirror the Three Terraces: Fenghou as the Upper Terrace, Tianlao as the Middle Terrace, and the Five Sages as the Lower Terrace. He obtained a treasure tripod that cooked without fire, tracked the sun’s movement with divining stalks, appointed Fenghu as general, and named his wife Fei Xiu’s son as crown prince. With Zhang Ruo, Ti Peng, Limu, Rong Guang, Long Yu, Cang Jie, Rong Cheng, Da Nao, Tu Long, and other ministers as his wings, he battled Chiyou at Zhuolu.

The Emperor’s forces faltered. Chiyou conjured a great fog that enshrouded all for three days, leaving no sense of direction. Fenghou, emulating the Dipper’s mechanism, crafted a great chariot with a pointer to indicate the south, restoring the four cardinal directions. The Emperor, grieving and indignant, fasted at the foot of Mount Tai. The Queen Mother of the West dispatched an envoy clad in a black fox-fur robe to deliver a talisman, saying, *"Concentrate your spirit and petition Heaven; the Supreme Lord will surely respond."* Days later, a dense fog descended, obscuring the day. The Mystic Woman descended before the Emperor, riding a cinnabar phoenix and driving a radiant cloud, clad in a nine-colored feathered robe. The Emperor prostrated himself twice and received her mandate.

The Mystic Woman said, *"By the Supreme Emperor’s decree, you may ask what you will."* The Emperor bowed deeply and said, *"Chiyou’s tyranny poisons the people; the Four Seas cry out, and none can preserve their lives. I seek the art of invincibility to rid the world of this scourge—is this possible?"* The Mystic Woman then bestowed upon him the talismans of the Six Jia and Six Ren, the *Divine Treasures of the Five Emperors* for commanding spirits, the *Five Luminous Seals* for subduing demons and communing with the numinous, the *Formulas of the Five Yin and Five Yang* for concealment and transformation, the *Diagrams of the Supreme Unity, Ten Essences, Four Spirits* for divining victory and defeat, and the *Oral Instructions of the Five Weapons and River Chart* for strategic precision.

With these, the Emperor rallied the feudal lords and again battled Chiyou in Jizhou. Chiyou marshaled demons and monsters into formation, with the Rain Master and Wind Earl as his guards, while the Responding Dragon hoarded water to assail the Emperor. The Emperor countered his schemes, slaying Chiyou in the wilds of Juepei, within the borders of Ji. Four tombs were raised for his remains. Thereafter, Yugang defied the Emperor’s command and was executed in the wilds of Banquan. The Xuanzhai were driven north, and the Four Directions were pacified. The Emperor traversed the Four Poles, a journey of twenty-eight thousand *li*, then cast tripods and established the Nine Provinces. He appointed ministers of the Five Phases and Nine Virtues to observe Heaven and Earth, sacrificed to the myriad spirits, and promulgated laws and teachings. Finally, he smelted copper from Shoushan and cast tripods at the foot of Mount Jing. A yellow dragon descended to welcome him, and he ascended to Heaven upon its back.

**Madame Sun**
Madame Sun was the wife of Zhang Daoling, the Three Heavens Dharma Master. Together, they secluded themselves on Mount Longhu to cultivate the Dao of the Three Primes through silent audience. Over the years, their practices bore numinous responses. The Heavenly Master obtained the *Central Elixir of the Yellow Emperor’s Dragon and Tiger*, and upon its completion, consumed it. He gained the ability to divide his form and scatter his radiance, sitting or standing at will, vanishing and reappearing.

The Heavenly Master entered Mount Songgao from Poyang and obtained the *Hidden Writ of Command and Control*, enabling him to summon and dispatch ghosts and spirits. At the time, the realm was in turmoil, those in power were imperiled, and the Dao of culture had withered, insufficient to rescue the world from peril or aid its governance. Though he began cultivating the Dao at fifty, and another twenty years passed after the elixir’s completion, once his techniques grew exquisitely refined, he journeyed into Shu, traversing its famous mountains while personally propagating the teachings. Meanwhile, Madame resided in the southlands, her Dao-transformations flourishing. In the first year of Emperor Chong’s *Yongjia* reign (the *yiyou* year), she arrived in Shu and dwelled at Yangping, where she refined the *Golden Liquor* and the *Nine Elixirs*. Following the method bestowed by the Primordial Lady of Grand Unity—a method transmitted from the Yellow Emperor—she spent years perfecting the elixir. Upon its completion, she could transform her form and take flight at will. In the second year of Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* reign (the *bingshen* year), on the ninth day of the ninth month, she and the Heavenly Master ascended to Heaven in broad daylight from the Cloud Terrace at Banzhong, attaining the rank of Supreme Perfected and Eastern Marchmount Madame.

Their son, Heng, styled Lingzhen, inherited their aspirations and continued their cultivation, succeeding as the lineage’s Dharma Master. In the second year of Emperor Ling’s *Guanghe* reign (the *jiwei* year), on the twenty-third day of the first month, he too ascended to Heaven in broad daylight from Yangping. Their grandson, Lu, styled Gongqi, was known in the world as the Lineage Master. As the Han dynasty declined and the Central Plains descended into chaos, he served as Governor of Liang and Yi Prefectures and General Who Pacifies the South, administering Hanzhong. When Emperor Ling of Wei dispatched envoys to confer ranks and titles upon him, Liu Zhang’s loss of Shu prompted the Master to raise troops. Gongqi, however, feigned transformation, concealing his radiance and departing. The stele of Prince An of Yangping states: "When the lineage’s Dharma Master attained realization and ascended, this mountain’s mists dispersed, its vapors shifted, and the azure heavens parted. In an instant, the earth trembled as if coursed by wild swans and phoenixes, and he ascended in broad daylight. His numinous might soared aloft, his divine form vanished into the distance. The elders of the western lands grasped at phoenix wings but found no foothold; the heroes of the southern realms gazed upon the dragon’s beard but could not reach it. From that day of ascension, it became the date for ritual offerings and sacrifices."

Initially, when Madame resided at her oratory, people from near and far revered her teachings, flocking to pay homage like a bustling market. Later, as she tended the furnace and cauldron with utmost rigor, she feared that the crowds might profane the sacred space. Thus, she caused a spring to well forth at the mountain’s base, instructing those who came to pay respects to first bathe in its waters before approaching the tranquil sanctuary. This was called the *Water for Dissolving Impurities*, and it remains to this day. The Heavenly Master bequeathed a method for drawing water from the stone well, which proved efficacious for both men and women, becoming a ritual for begetting offspring. The mountain has three tiers, symbolizing the Three Realms. At its front lies the Boyang Pool, where the Most High Lord Lao once roamed and feasted. Behind it is the Grotto of Ascending Perfection, which secretly connects through hidden passages with the grottoes and chambers of Mount Qingcheng, Mount Emei, Qingyi, Western Mystery, Luofu, and Dongting—all immortal mountains. Thus, it stands as the foremost among the Twenty-Four Oratories.

**The Silkworm Maiden**
The Silkworm Maiden was the essence of the Star of the Chamber. During the reign of Emperor Gaoxin, Shu had yet to establish a ruler, and only the Shushan clan reigned over a region. Its people lived in scattered clans without unified governance, often preying upon one another, the strong oppressing the weak. The Silkworm Maiden dwelled in what is now Guanghan Prefecture, though her surname has been lost. Her father was abducted by a neighboring clan and gone for over a year, leaving only his horse behind. Grieving her father’s absence, she forsook food and drink. Her mother consoled her, and the maiden swore to their clan: "Whoever can bring my father home, I shall marry." Though the clan heard her vow, none could retrieve her father. The horse, however, heard her words, reared up in excitement, snapped its tether, and galloped away. Months later, her father returned upon the horse. From then on, the horse neighed day and night without cease, refusing to eat or drink. When her father asked the reason, her mother recounted the vow made before the clan. He replied, "A vow made to people is not a vow made to a horse. How could a human wed a beast? Though this horse rescued me from peril—a great deed—its vow cannot be fulfilled." The horse’s neighing and prostrations grew more frantic, until it threatened harm. Enraged, the father shot and killed it, then hung its hide in the courtyard to dry. As the maiden passed by, the hide suddenly sprang up, wrapped around her, and flew away. Ten days later, she was found perched in a mulberry tree, transformed into a silkworm. She ate mulberry leaves and spun silk, weaving brocade and fine gauze to clothe the people. Thus began the silkworm’s existence.

Her parents, filled with remorse, could not cease mourning her. One day, the Silkworm Maiden descended from the heavens upon a cloud of colors, riding the same horse, attended by dozens of retainers. She addressed her parents: "The Most High, seeing my filial devotion and unwavering righteousness, has appointed me as a Handmaiden of the Nine Palaces. I have attained immortality—do not grieve for me." With these words, she vanished into the void. Her tomb lies at the border of Shiyu, Mianzhu, and Deyang counties. Every year, those who pray for silkworms gather from all directions, and all receive numinous responses. In Shu’s customs, the images of jade maidens in temples are draped with horsehide, called the *Horse-Head Maiden*, to pray for silkworms. The common saying holds that her corpse was hung in a tree, called a mulberry, and out of shame for transforming into a worm, she was named the *silkworm*. The *Rhapsody on Investigating the Sacred* states: "There was a woman who, moved by a dead horse, transformed into a silkworm, clothing the world." The *Book of Yin and Yang* says: "The silkworm and horse are of the same kind," revealing that she was the transformation of the Star of the Chamber.

**Madame Peng**
Madame Peng was the granddaughter of Peng Zu. Zu’s surname was Qian, his given name Keng, and he was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu and son of Lu Zhong. Emperor Shun recommended him to Emperor Yao, noting his skill in seasoning broths. When he presented pheasant broth to Yao, the emperor, recognizing his mastery of flavors, surmised that one who could nurture life must also nurture the people. Thus, he enfeoffed him at Pengcheng. His Dao became ancestral, and the people of Peng saw him generation after generation, hence the name *Peng Zu*—the Ancestor of Peng. The land lies in Xuzhou, but Peng Zu, having attained the Dao, found no joy in ascending to Heaven. Instead, he wandered the Four Seas, residing in Shu for many years. His descendants flourished, giving rise to the names Pengshan, Tianpeng, and Pengmen, all in Shu.

The *Rites Classic* states: "Weilu, Peng, and Pu are all lands of Shu." The Dao River flows past Mount Tianpeng, where two peaks stand like palace gates, separated by over forty paces—this is called Pengmen, where the Ancestor once secluded himself and thus took it as his name. Peng’s granddaughter also attained the Way of nurturing life, following her ancestor in cultivation for several hundred years. Diligent in devotion, she paid homage morning and evening without weariness. Today, on Mount Peng’s Daughter, there is a prostration stone bearing the marks of her five limbs, elbows, and knees, as well as the imprint of her robes and hairpin, some nearly an inch deep. Whenever she traveled to Beiping Cave or this mountain, both were transformed by her presence. One day, she ascended to Heaven here, and later a county was established, named after the mountain. In the *dingyou* year of the Yuanhe era, the former *jinshi* Zhan Ben erected a stele to record these events, which are detailed in the *Annals of Shu*.

As for Fengpei’s Pengcheng, it was the land of Peng Zu’s original enfeoffment, and the state of Great Peng once stood as one of the Five Hegemons. In the fifth month of the *gengshen* year of the Guanghua era of the Tang, three cranes flew in and nested together in the cypress tree atop Peng’s Daughter Temple, their nest spanning six feet. The prefectural governor, Minister of Works Zhang Lin, reported this to the Lord of Shu. The Prince of Xiping, Xiang Deng, performed offerings and oversaw the temple’s renovation. That night, a thousand divine lamps illuminated the forests and ridges. The scene was painted and submitted to the throne, and an imperial edict praised the event, which was later recorded in the *History of the Tang*.

**Nong Yu**
Nong Yu was the daughter of Duke Mu of Qin, fond of playing the flute. At the time, there was a man named Xiao Shi, skilled in flute-playing, and the duke gave Nong Yu to him in marriage, building a terrace for them to reside. After over a decade of playing the flute, Nong Yu could mimic the cry of a phoenix, and a phoenix alighted upon their terrace. The couple lived there for years without descending, until one day they followed the phoenix and flew away. Thus, Duke Mu built the Phoenix Maiden’s Shrine at Yong Palace, where flute music was often heard.

**The Gardener’s Wife**
The Gardener’s Wife was a divine woman. The gardener was a man of Jiyin, handsome in appearance and bearing. Many sought to marry their daughters to him, but he never wed. He often cultivated multicolored fragrant herbs, consuming their fruit for decades. Suddenly, five-colored moths gathered on the herbs, and the gardener collected them, spreading them on cloth, where they hatched into radiant silkworms. When the time came, a woman appeared to help him raise them, feeding them the fragrant herbs. The silkworms grew robust, yielding one hundred and twenty cocoons, each as large as a jar, their threads taking six or seven days to fully unwind. When the reeling was done, the woman and the gardener departed together. Today, Jiyin still has a shrine to the Radiant Silkworms.

**Chang Rong**
Chang Rong was the daughter of a Shang king. She cultivated the Dao on Mount Chang, eating the roots of *pengmeng* for over two hundred years while retaining the appearance of a twenty-year-old. She could procure purple herbs, selling them to dyers, whose colors became doubly vibrant with them. She used the money to aid the poor and sick, and for generations, people in cities and towns saw her, with over a thousand households venerating her, though none knew the Way she practiced. She often walked at noon without casting a shadow, and some said she could refine her form. Suddenly, she ascended to Heaven.

**The Wine-Seller of Hanzhong Pass**
The wine-seller at Hanzhong Pass was of unknown origin and surname. One day, she encountered a diviner named Zi Xian, also of unknown origin, who appeared to be fifty but claimed to be several hundred years old. The wine-seller marveled at him and treated him with great respect. One morning, he suddenly said to her, "Prepare quickly; we must go together to answer the call of the King of Zhongling." That night, two men arrived, each holding a straw dog—one for Zi Xian, one for the wine-seller—and bade them mount, for the dogs were dragons. They followed the men to the summit of Mount Huayin, where Zi Xian often shouted, "Zi Xian and the Wine Mother are here! These days, we have attained the Dao of immortals and sages!"

**Nü Ji**
Nü Ji was a wine-seller in the market of Chen. Her wine was always excellent, and when an immortal passed by her home to drink, he left five scrolls of the *Plain Book* as collateral for the wine money. Nü Ji opened them to find methods for cultivating life and attaining longevity. She secretly copied the essentials and practiced them. After three years, her complexion grew youthful, like that of a twenty-year-old. Years later, the immortal returned to redeem the scrolls and laughed, saying, "To steal the Dao without a teacher is like having wings but not flying." Nü Ji then followed the immortal away, living in the mountains for years, where people often saw her. Later, her whereabouts became unknown. The mountain where she lived is now called Mount Nü Ji.

**The Daughter of the Prince of Hejian**
The daughter of the Prince of Hejian was the wife of Xuan Su. Xuan Su had attained the Way of divine immortals and had traveled to Hejian for hundreds of years. Locals often saw him at noon without a shadow, and he subsisted on *badou* and mica, selling them in the market—seven pills for two coins could cure a hundred ailments. The Prince of Hejian, suffering from illness, bought and took them, passing over ten serpents. When asked about his condition, Xuan Su replied that the prince’s illness stemmed from the residual misfortunes of six generations, not his own doing. "Long ago, the prince once released a nursing deer, which was the mother of a qilin. His benevolence moved Heaven, and thus he was destined to meet me." An elderly retainer of the prince’s household recalled his parents saying that Xuan Su cast no shadow at noon, and when the prince summoned him to verify, it proved true. The prince’s daughter had abstained from meat and blood since childhood, cherishing purity and the Dao, so the prince gave her to Xuan Su in marriage. After several years, they entered the mountains of Chang together, where they were occasionally seen.

**The Gatherer Girl**
The Gatherer Girl was a palace maiden of the Shang king. From a young age, she mastered the Way of nurturing the spirit and lived for over two hundred and seventy years, yet appeared no older than fifteen or sixteen. Initially, the king, hearing of Peng Zu’s attainment of the Dao, appointed him as a grandee and enfeoffed him at Peng. Peng Zu often claimed illness to live in seclusion, avoiding political affairs. He consumed mica powder, deer antler, mica-infused water, and cassia, maintaining a youthful appearance. His nature was serene, and he never spoke of his attainment of the Dao.

The king visited to inquire, yet Peng Zu refused to reveal anything. Though the king bestowed rare treasures upon him, he accepted them only to relieve the poor, keeping nothing for himself. The king then had a resplendent hall with purple chambers built in the palace gardens, adorned with gold and jade, and ordered Peng Zu to reside there. He commanded the Gatherer Girl to ride in a curtained carriage and seek the Way from Peng Zu.

The Gatherer Girl bowed twice and asked about the methods for prolonging life and increasing longevity. Peng Zu replied: "Those who ascend in bodily form to the heavens to fill the ranks of the immortals must consume the Golden Elixir of the Supreme One of the Primordial Lord—only then can they ascend in broad daylight. This Way is most exalted, yet not something a king should pursue. Next is the practice of treasuring essence, nurturing the spirit, and consuming herbal medicines, which can grant long life, though one cannot command ghosts and spirits or ride the void in flight. Further still is the circulation of yin and yang, guiding and stretching the body, bending and extending the limbs so that the hundred joints flow smoothly and the mechanisms of the body remain unobstructed. This can prevent illness and pain from encroaching. Thereafter, one may contemplate the spirit, focus on the true, sit in forgetfulness, and refine the fluids—all of which can extend one’s years. As for the Way of dual cultivation and the essentials of reversing the flow to replenish the brain, these are exceedingly difficult to practice, fraught with dangers akin to treading upon thorns or walking on blades, and thus not suitable for a king. My knowledge is shallow, and my Way extends no further; it is not worth disseminating."

"In the land of Dawan, there is the Master of Azure Essence, who has lived a thousand years yet retains the complexion of a child. Sometimes he fasts for an entire year; other times, he eats nine meals in a day. One may inquire of him regarding the Way."

The Gatherer Girl asked, "What kind of immortal is the Master of Azure Essence?"

Peng Zu answered, "He has attained the Way, but he is not an immortal. Immortals may refine their bodies to ascend into the clouds without wings and fly, or ride dragons and tigers to reach the grand steps of heaven. Some take the forms of birds and beasts, soaring through the azure skies, or dive into rivers and seas, roaming famous mountains. Some consume primordial qi, or eat the blossoms of the magic mushroom; some move among people, while others conceal themselves in forests and wilds. Their faces bear unusual bones, and their bodies sprout extraordinary hairs. They cherish seclusion and do not mingle with the vulgar. As for those who cultivate themselves in the human realm, they should eat fine delicacies, wear light and elegant garments, dwell in official positions, and harmonize yin and yang. Their ears and eyes will be sharp, their bones and joints strong, their complexions radiant, and their spirits luminous. Though aged, they will not decline, extending their years and lingering long in the world. Cold and damp, wind and warmth cannot harm them; ghosts, spirits, and myriad essences cannot afflict them. Swords, weapons, and the hundred insects cannot strike them; sorrow, joy, slander, and praise cannot burden them. This is what is truly worthy of esteem."

"In this world, if one nurtures life properly, one may live to a hundred and twenty years. Those who fall short do so because they have harmed themselves. Excessive drunkenness, gluttony, joy, anger, warmth, cold, labor, and exhaustion all cause harm. Extreme pleasure, sorrow, fear, terror, agitation, restlessness, extravagance, and lust also cause harm. Severe hunger, thirst, thought, and worry likewise cause harm, as do prolonged sitting, standing, lying down, and walking. When cold and warmth are moderated, hunger and satiety are balanced, and one is free from thought and action, abiding only in clarity and stillness—only then can one speak of cultivating the body. Having attained longevity, if one continues to nurture life properly, one may live to two hundred and forty, or even four hundred and eighty years, so long as no harm is done."

"To avoid losing harmony with the four seasons, one should not be too warm in winter or too cold in summer—this is how the body is properly regulated. Beautiful countenances and graceful forms that do not incite desire—this is how the spirit is harmonized. Chariots, robes, and dignified bearing, knowing contentment and not seeking excess—this is how the will is unified. The eight sounds and five colors, if not indulged in to excess—this is how the heart is guided. All these things are meant to nurture people, yet if one cannot temper them to the mean, they become afflictions instead. Thus, the sages and worthies have left warnings, fearing that those of lesser talent would drown in them, forgetting to return and losing the proper use of things. Therefore, those who cultivate the Way all enjoin abstinence, seeking to restrain and regulate them with ease."

"Thus it is said: The superior person sleeps in a separate bed; the middling person uses a different coverlet. Consuming a hundred packets of medicine is not as good as sleeping alone. Beauty blinds the eyes; sound deafens the ears; fragrance clogs the nose; desire agitates the heart; taste dulls the mouth. If one can regulate and employ them appropriately, using them as they ought to be used, then even if one does not seek long life, its benefits will surely be attained. This is like fire and water—if used excessively, they become harmful instead."

"People do not understand the damage to their meridians, the insufficiency of their blood and qi, the hollowness within, or the emptiness of their marrow and brain. Their bodies are already ailing, so they are afflicted by external influences, and illnesses arise from wind, cold, wine, and lust. If one’s foundation were full and solid, how could one fall ill? Excessive longing and envy harm a person; sorrow, grief, and lamentation harm a person; immoderate joy harms a person; unresolved anger harms a person; obsessive love harms a person; constant worry harms a person; improper regulation of cold and warmth harms a person; failure to harmonize yin and yang harms a person. The causes of harm are many, yet to blame only the bedchamber is truly deluded."

"Thus, the union of man and woman is like the mutual generation of heaven and earth. It is a means of guiding and nurturing the spirit and qi, ensuring that one does not lose harmony. Heaven and earth separate by day and unite by night; in a year, they join three hundred and sixty times. Thus, the four seasons are balanced, and the myriad things are born. Generation upon generation, completion upon completion, without end—this is how heaven does not lose its movement, earth does not lose its stillness, qi does not lose its harmony, and things do not lose their life, enabling them to endure long. If a person cannot emulate the constancy of heaven and earth, clinging instead to one corner, dwelling alone in a single shadow, shouting, wearing coarse garments, and fasting—such self-inflicted suffering is the height of folly."

"Beyond these methods of cultivation, regulation, and moderation, there is the practice of consuming primordial harmony. If one attains its Way, evil spirits cannot enter—this is the foundation of governing the body. I have compiled over seventeen hundred methods, including absorbing the radiance, contemplating the spirit, circulating through the viscera, guiding and stretching, swallowing and consuming, and the practices of ingestion and refinement. There are also the methods for the four seasons: facing the proper direction, self-examination, repenting transgressions, and the proper times for lying down and rising. These can be taught to beginners, guiding them toward the gate of goodness, gradually correcting their hearts, and slowly dispelling their faults. They do not immediately enable one to attain the Way. If one’s blood and vessels are withered, one’s spirit and qi are decayed—how can one contemplate the spirit, focus on the true, and preserve them? One would not yet know their benefits."

These errors arise from foolish people pursuing the Dao while seeking only its branches, neglecting its root. Furthermore, if one fails to nurture the spirit within while exhausting the body without, primordial essence gradually depletes, and spirit and qi become weary and spent. Yet they still toil day and night, reciting scriptures and incantations—this, too, is of no benefit. When no effects manifest after long practice, they grow resentful, blaming the Dao for being inefficacious and accusing the ancients of deceiving them—this, again, is wrong.

My master said: The *Nine Chamber Scriptures on Unbinding the Form and Embracing Non-Action*, numbering thirteen thousand chapters, merely point to the threshold of initial entry. When the Weaver Girl received all the essential methods and taught them to the King, he tested them and found them all effective. The King practiced Peng Zu’s Way and lived over three hundred years, yet he could not refrain from licentious indulgence. Later, the Weaver Girl’s whereabouts became unknown—she must have attained the Dao.

**The Solar Woman**
The Solar Woman, surnamed Zhu, given name Yi, mastered the essentials of inner cultivation and the benefits of exhalation and inhalation. She expounded the Way of the Five Phases, applying it with profound subtlety, and her practice yielded remarkable results. At two hundred and eighty years of age, her complexion resembled peach blossoms, her lips as if holding cinnabar, her skin and body full and lustrous, her brows and temples like a painting. Her radiance dazzled the eye, and she appeared no older than seventeen or eighteen.

She served Jue Dongzi, whose surname was Li, given name Xiu. He possessed the arts of the Tiger at *yin* and the Dragon at *shen*, and authored forty scrolls titled *The Source of the Dao*. Having lived among people for several hundred years, Zhu served him with utmost diligence and fully grasped the essentials of the Dao. He admonished her: "My practice relies on softness overcoming hardness and weakness subduing strength. In its execution, reverence is the foundation. As if treading deep abysses or traversing perilous heights, or driving a galloping steed or a startled chariot, even a hair’s breadth of error will cost you your glory. Diligently guard this, and you may attain longevity."

Later, they refined the Golden Elixir. Upon its completion, they consumed it and together ascended to heaven.

**The Lunar Woman**
The Lunar Woman, surnamed Ying, given name Jin, was exceptionally intelligent and wise, surpassing all others. She studied the Way of Yuzi but, though she grasped its methods, could not penetrate its subtleties. Realizing she lacked a teacher, she set up a wine stall by the roadside to secretly seek one.

One day, Taiyangzi passed by and drank at her shop. Observing her refined speech, graceful demeanor, and respectful manners, he sighed: "She practices the White Tiger and the Slaying Serpent, while I cultivate the Azure Dragon and the Dark Warrior. In this vast world, who truly understands?" Upon hearing this, she rejoiced and sent her younger sister to ask the traveler’s place of origin. He replied: "Three in the south, five in the north, nine in the east, seven in the west, and one in the center." Her sister returned and reported: "This guest is a great sage, a perfected Daoist." "I asked one question, and he knew five—this must be so."

She then invited him into her chamber, offering her name and fine delicacies. When she inquired about the essentials of longevity, Taiyangzi said: "To serve in the court of the Heavenly Emperor, to drink together the waters of divine radiance, to ascend the guiding principles of Yuzi, and to pay homage to the secret treasures of the Five Phases—who else would one befriend if not the worthy?" He then taught her the essentials of supplementation and guiding, and transmitted the method for refining the steaming elixir. After compounding and consuming it, she attained immortality, though she was already two hundred years old, with the appearance of a young maiden.

Taiyangzi, surnamed Yu, given name Ming, was a close friend of Prince Zi. When Yuzi attained the Dao, Taiyangzi became his disciple and served him with utmost devotion. Among Yuzi’s three thousand disciples, only Taiyangzi remained perpetually drunk day and night. For over three hundred years, he never refined his practice. Yuzi admonished him: "You ought to govern your body and nurture your life to become a teacher of the worthy. Yet you remain lost in drunkenness, neglecting your cultivation and failing to compound the Great Medicine. Even if you live a thousand years, you will still not escape death—this is behavior unworthy even of the common, let alone the enlightened."

He then reformed his ways and refined the elixir. Upon its completion, he consumed it and departed as an immortal, having lived over five hundred years with the appearance of youth.

Yuzi, surnamed Zhang, given name Zhen, was a native of Nanjun. When King You of Zhou learned of his attainment of the Dao, he summoned him, but Yuzi refused to appear. He then retreated into the mountains and attained the Dao.

**The Grand Mystery Woman**
The Grand Mystery Woman, surnamed Zhuan, given name He, lost her father in her youth. A diviner examined her mother and declared that none of her children would live long. Grieved by this, she often lamented: "In this world, a single misstep cannot be undone, and death cannot be reversed. Hearing that one’s lifespan is short, without cultivating the Dao, how can one extend it?"

She then traveled in search of an enlightened teacher, purifying her heart to seek the Dao. She obtained Yuzi’s methods and practiced them for many years, eventually gaining the ability to enter water without getting wet. In the depths of winter, she wore only a single garment atop ice, yet her complexion remained unchanged, and her body stayed warm for days on end. She could also relocate government offices, palaces, cities, and houses to other places—appearing no different, yet vanishing at a gesture. Locked doors, cabinets, and chests opened at her pointing. Mountains crumbled and trees snapped at her command, yet with another gesture, all returned to their original state.

When traveling with disciples and night fell in the mountains, she would strike a stone with her staff, and the stone would open to reveal a chamber with beds, curtains, kitchens, and wine—all as usual. Even after journeying ten thousand *li*, this remained the case wherever they went. She could make small objects suddenly grow as large as a house, or large objects shrink to the size of a hair’s tip. She could exhale fire to fill the sky, then extinguish it with a breath. She could sit amidst flames without her clothes or shoes burning. In an instant, she might transform into a child or a carriage and horses—nothing was beyond her power.

She practiced thirty-six arts, all with remarkable efficacy, reviving the dead and saving countless lives. Yet no one knew the source of her abilities, nor what she consumed to sustain herself. Her complexion grew ever more youthful, her hair as black as a crow’s. Suddenly, one day, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

**Lady Fan**
Lady Fan was the wife of Liu Gang. Gang, styled Boluan, served as Magistrate of Shangyu and also possessed Daoist arts. He could summon ghosts and spirits, command transformations, and practice esoteric techniques unknown to others. Embracing tranquility and simplicity, his governance was effective, and the people benefited without suffering from droughts, floods, epidemics, or sudden calamities. Year after year, the harvests were abundant, and he was revered by those near and far.

In their leisure, Master Liu and Lady Fan would compare their arts. Once, as they sat together in the hall, Liu conjured a fire that engulfed the guest quarters, rising from the east. Lady Fan restrained it, and the flames instantly vanished. In the courtyard stood two peach trees; the couple each commanded one to fight the other. After some time, the tree under Liu’s command was repeatedly defeated and fled beyond the fence. Liu spat into a tray, and it became a crucian carp; Lady Fan spat into the tray, and it turned into an otter, which devoured the fish. Later, as they entered the Siming Mountains, they encountered a tiger on the path. Liu restrained it, and the tiger crouched motionless. When they prepared to depart, the tiger howled. Lady Fan strode forward, and the tiger pressed its face to the ground, daring not to look up. She bound it with a rope and led it home, tethering it to the leg of their bed.

Whenever they tested their arts, Liu was outmatched in every instance. When the time came for them to ascend to heaven, a large honey locust tree stood beside the county hall. Liu climbed the tree several *zhang* high and could fly upward by his own power, while Lady Fan simply sat upon her bed, rising gently like drifting clouds. Together, they ascended to heaven and departed.

**The Divine Mother of Dongling**
The Divine Mother of Dongling was a native of Hailing in Guangling. She married into the Du family and studied the Dao under Liu Gang, mastering the arts of shapeshifting and concealment, appearing and vanishing without limit. Her husband, Du, disbelieved in the Dao and often grew angry with her. The Divine Mother would sometimes heal the sick and save lives, or travel to visit Du, which only deepened his resentment. He reported her to the authorities, accusing her of licentious sorcery and neglecting her household duties. The officials arrested her and imprisoned her, but soon after, she flew out through the prison window. The crowd watched as she rose higher and higher into the clouds, leaving behind a single shoe beneath the window. Thereafter, she ascended to heaven.

From then on, people far and near built temples to worship her, and their prayers were swiftly answered. A green crow often appeared at the altar, and if someone had lost an item, they could inquire of it; the crow would then alight upon the thief. The roads became free of lost property, and over time, such occurrences ceased entirely. To this day, in the seas of Hailing, no one dares commit theft or villainy—those who attempt great crimes are drowned by wind and waves or killed by tigers and wolves, while lesser offenses bring illness or injury.

**The Maiden of Xihe**
The Maiden of Xihe was the niece of the immortal Boshanfu. Boshanfu, a native of Yongzhou, entered Mount Hua to study the Dao. Through diligent cultivation and the ingestion of medicinal substances, he returned to his hometown after two hundred years, his appearance ever more youthful. Whenever he entered a household, he could discern the virtues and transgressions of its ancestors as if he had witnessed them himself, and he could foretell future fortunes with unerring accuracy.

Seeing that his niece was often ill, he gave her medicine. Though she was already seventy when she took it, she gradually regained her youth, her complexion like that of an infant. During the Han dynasty, an imperial envoy traveling through Xihe saw a woman at the eastern gate of the city striking an old man. The man’s hair was white as frost, and he knelt to receive the blows. The envoy, astonished, questioned her. The woman replied, “This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu attained the Dao of immortals and secluded himself on Mount Hua. Pitying my frequent illnesses, he gave me divine medicine, which I took to restore my youth. This son of mine refused to take the medicine, and so he has grown decrepit, unable to keep pace with me. I am displeased with him, hence the punishment.”

The envoy asked their ages. The woman answered, “I am two hundred and thirty years old, and my son is seventy.” Later, she too entered Mount Hua, attained immortality, and departed.
