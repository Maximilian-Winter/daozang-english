**Title:** *The Records of the Sagely Origins of the Primordial Dao* (*Hunyuan Shengji*). Nine fascicles. Compiled by Xie Cailan of the Song dynasty. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, "Compendia and Registers" section of the *Dongshen* division. Collated with the *Chongkan Daozang Jiyao* edition.

**Preface to *The Records of the Sagely Origins of the Primordial Dao***

Huaiying once pursued the path of a scholar-official, and thus knew well the reverence due to Master Kong. Later, he doffed his Confucian cap and departed to become a Daoist, applying the same reverence he had shown to Master Kong to the Venerable Master Lao. Thereupon, he composed a work in several fascicles, gathering without omission all accounts of Laozi’s names, transformations, and subtle sayings scattered among the Hundred Schools since the dawn of time, arranging them in order as *The Sagely Records*. Alas! How single-minded and erudite he was—truly a service to the Daoist tradition.

Confucians, enamored of office, cannot devote themselves wholeheartedly to scholarship, and thus often lack the leisure to delve into the chronicles of past ages. Even when they do find the time, they dare not stray from meticulous selection, constrained by the Six Classics and unable to roam freely. Thus, while the Way of our Master Kong endures as boundlessly as Heaven and Earth, and while many have revered him, none have produced a work like Huaiying’s.

Had Huaiying fortunately completed his former calling and not left to become a Daoist, this work would have been written for the Kong lineage—how great would its merit have been! Yet, in ancient times, the Grand Historian Sima Qian once composed the "Hereditary House of Confucius," for he too harbored such an ambition. Critics, however, countered: if the Master’s Way endures as boundlessly as Heaven and Earth, why compare it to the longevity of the feudal lords of the Warring States or the Han? Thus, the *Hereditary House* seems out of place. Moreover, the descendants of the Kong lineage, recording what they had heard, produced works like the *Kong Family Sayings* and *Kong Congzi*, yet Confucians scarcely extolled them. When these texts veered toward exaggerating the Sage’s grandeur with trivialities like "grave goods of lamb and mulberry arrows," some dismissed them as fantastical and unworthy of consideration.

Had Huaiying not become a Daoist and instead composed a work revering the Kong lineage, he would have been bound to adjudicate the Hundred Schools by the *Six Classics*, unable to roam so freely in his erudition. For this, I sigh over Huaiying’s misfortune—his inability to anchor himself in the lineage of Confucius. Yet, in another light, he was fortunate to find refuge in the lineage of Laozi.

Thus, I inscribe this preface.

Huaiying’s surname was Xie, his given name Shouxie, a native of Yongjia. He was my fellow student. Written on a day in the eighth month of the fourth year of the Shaoxi reign (1193) by Chen Fuliang.

**Memorial Presented to the Throne**

The humble servant Shouxie respectfully states: The manifest traces of the Great Clarity rely entirely upon the concordant records of trustworthy histories. The surviving scriptures of vast kalpas await the radiant reign to reach their fullest completeness. Such an era is rare to attain, for the Dao does not operate in vain.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, I, Shouxie, bow my head and prostrate myself. I humbly consider that above the nine heavens lies the fabled Imperial Homeland, while beyond the six directions the sacred canons endure. Without the *Three Tombs*, the proximate legacy of Fuxi and Shennong would have faded; with the emergence of the *Six Classics*, the enterprises of Zhou and Kong flourished. During the flourishing eras of Han and Tang, the supreme teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi were universally esteemed. Sages and worthies arose in leisure, the primordial transformation spread abundantly, the ways of the world prospered in tandem, and this culture did not decline.

The Supreme Sage of the Primordial Origin treasured the great source of the wondrous Dao, giving birth to heaven and earth without revealing its beginnings, spiritually animating ghosts and emperors without exhausting its boundless domain. From the kalpas of *Yan Kang* and *Chi Ming*, he served as the teacher of successive dynasties. By the time of the Shang and the house of Ji, he manifested in divided forms to respond to transformation. Teaching without distinction, he enabled the Western barbarians to attain the Dao. The profound Dao being unfathomable, he appeared as a dragon in the east of Lu.

Yet those who comprehend it are few, so it is no wonder that its discourse remains unexplored. Ancient traditions glimpsed but a part like peering at a leopard through a tube, while later scholars increasingly strayed like sheep lost on divergent paths. The complete corpus of the hidden chamber remains unknown, and this indeed constitutes a deficiency in the teachings’ canon.

Though my talent falls short of entering the inner chamber and my learning shames the gate of Master Zhuan, I dare not gallop in the realm of brush and ink. My efforts extend no further than grazing in the garden of arts and letters, refining my essence to produce but half a crane’s worth, wielding the brush until my hand resembles a tortoise’s. I have gathered the books of the Three Teachings and compiled them into the *Sacred Records*. I have examined and collated the sayings of a hundred schools—

*Records of the Primordial Sage, Volume One*
Compiled by Xie Shoubin, Daoist Master of Observing the Return, of the Song Dynasty

The Most High Lord Lao is the sovereign of the Great Dao, the primordial origin of all teachings. He emerged before the Great Void, arose from the source of the Ultimate Non-Being, traversed eons beyond reckoning, and endures without end, extends without limit. Adapting his teachings to the times, he has served as master across kalpas, concealing and revealing, being and non-being—beyond all measure.

Yet in his manifestations to establish the teachings for the world, his responses and apparitions shine as brightly as the sun and moon; how could they remain unrecorded? However, existing chronicles and biographies are largely fragmentary and incomplete. Works such as Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian*, Ban Gu’s *Ancient and Modern Register of Persons*, Liu Xiang’s *Arrayed Transcendents*, Ji Kang and Huangfu Mi’s *Accounts of Eminent Scholars*, along with Ge Zhichuan’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, *Collected Transcendents*, and *Compendium of Transcendents*—all are piecemeal, capturing but a fraction of the whole. Yin Wencao’s *Sacred Records* in eight hundred and twenty chapters and Jia Shanxiang’s *Like a Dragon*, divided into a hundred sections, though detailed in their accounts, sprawl with tangential digressions, lose coherence in sequence, and suffer from inconsistent selection, their contradictions multiplying confusion for the reader.

Each time I open these volumes, I cannot but sigh—truly a deficiency in the canon of the teachings. Now, undeterred by my own inadequacy, I have compiled and examined the scriptures and records of the Three Teachings, tracing their origins and evolution, and have arranged the accounts of reverence across the ages into the *Sacred Records*, prefaced by an annalistic chronicle.

As for the earliest era of the Five Primes and the beginnings of the Nine August Ones, before the emergence of the True Writ and when records remain obscure, I have here begun by compiling the historical accounts of Lord Lao’s manifestations in the world, setting forth his annalistic chronicle as follows:

**Heavenly Sovereign**
Huangfu Mi’s *Three and Five Calendars* states: At the inception of heaven and earth, there was the Heavenly Sovereign, twelve-headed, ruling by the virtue of Wood, with years reckoned from *Sheti*. Twelve brothers reigned, each for eighteen thousand years.
Xu Zheng’s *Records of the Three and Five Calendars* states: At the dawn of *Yuanxi*, there appeared a divine personage called the Heavenly Sovereign. At that time, Lord Lao descended into the world, known as the Master of Penetrating Mystery, also called the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterium.
The *Record of the Green Goat Palace*, composed by Yue Pengju, Hanlin Academician and Grand Preceptor of the Tang, states: The Most High Mysterious Primordial Lord Lao responded to the times and descended in manifestation, serving as teacher to the Heavenly Sovereign. At the first separation of the pure above and turbid below, the distance between them was not yet great; at the initial parting of the six directions and eight boundaries, the space between them was not yet far.

The forms of the square and round, above and below, were established; the vast and unrefined state of primordial chaos was determined. Rivers had newly melted yet waters remained murky; earth had just congealed yet stones were not yet firm. The Four Seas were matched to the Four Spirits, and the Five Phases were entrusted to the Five Emperors.

The Earthly Sovereign—Lord Lao descended to serve as his teacher, known as the Venerable Ancient Master. The *Tang Annals* state: At that time, the celestial image was still low, and the earthly form remained thin. The pole was established and positions fixed; transformation was spread and merit was built. Our Most High Lord Lao condescended to descend, serving as teacher to the Earthly Sovereign. He apportioned softness and firmness, regulated cold and heat. The earth grew broader and thicker; the heavens became higher and brighter. His sagely power was boundless, his divine work unfathomable. Ten thousand trees split their husks; ten thousand grasses hooked forth their sprouts. Feathered flocks and furred herds were distinguished in the positions of *dui* and *li*; shelled creatures and scaled kinds were divided among the offices of *kan* and *zhen*.

The Human Sovereign—*The Apocryphal Spring and Autumn* records him as the Nine-Headed Lord—Lord Lao descended to serve as his teacher, known as Master Pangu. The *Records of the Three and Five Calendars* state: Heaven and earth were chaotic like a chicken’s egg; Pangu was born within it. When heaven and earth split open, Pangu was within them, and afterward came the Three Sovereigns. This was the beginning of the Three Powers.

The *Tang Annals* state: After the years of the Azure Sea had passed, and the years of departing the Azure Sea had come, the Two Sages had already governed, and the four borders radiated light. Our Most High Lord Lao, in his vast compassion to relieve the multitudes, served as teacher to the Human Sovereign. The three hundred and sixty rivers first divided their blood vessels; the fifteen thousand strategies suddenly matched odd and even. The spirits of the three *ren* and three *yi* departed the womb from water and wood; the generals of the six *bing* and six *xin* were conceived from fire and wind. After one hundred fifty-six generations and forty-five thousand years, he was first called the Master of Penetrating Mystery, then titled the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, and thirdly named Master Pangu.

The Five Dragons recorded five clans; the Jade Emperor’s *Comprehensive Calendar* recorded the Gou Long era. The Lian Tong era recorded six clans, or was called the Lian Yao era. *The Apocryphal Spring and Autumn*, the *River Chart*, and the *Five Sovereigns’ Calendar* all record the Lian Tong era. The He Xiong era recorded three clans—*The Apocryphal Spring and Autumn* calls it the Han Xiong era. The *Initial Placement of Heaven and Earth Classic* calls it the He Xiong era. The Five Clans era—the *River Chart* states: The Tong era recorded five clans, which is called the Five Clans era. *The Apocryphal Spring and Autumn* includes the She Ti era, and the *Five Clans Record* further lists the Qiang Yi era. The Shu Ming era recorded four clans—the *Placement of Heaven and Earth Classic* calls it the Hou era. The *Jade Emperor’s Calendar* calls it the Xuan Ming era. The Xiu Fei era recorded nine clans—the *River Chart* calls it the Ju Fang clan. The Yin Ti era—the *River Chart* calls it the Ti Ting era. The Shan Tong era recorded seventy-two clans—the *River Chart* calls it the Tong Xing era. The Liu Qi era—*The Hidden Meanings of the Records of the Grand Historian: Annals of the Three Sovereigns* states: The Liu Qi era occurred during the time of the Yellow Emperor, when the nine eras were established.

The *River Chart’s Record of Successive Clans* states: In the most ancient times, the beginning of the people’s birth, male and female mingled their essences, and women gave birth to surnames. The first three heads were called the He Xiong era, known as the Three Generations. After the He Xiong clan perished, descendants passed down records of their lifespans, which was called the Shu Ming era. The Tong era recorded four clans, producing two generations of children. With many men and women, they lived together in connection, which was called the Lian Tong era. They produced one generation of children, and the Tong era recorded five clans, which was called the Five Clans era. The world’s people lived in groups, forming bonds by kind. With many men and women, they divided into nine heads, each with their own dwelling, hence called the Ju Fang clan. They produced thirty-two generations of children. The strong bullied the weak, seeking to devour and harm. Among them was a divine person who governed with authority, hence called the Ti Ting clan. They produced thirty-five generations of children. The Tong era recorded seventy-two clans, hence called the Tong Xing clan. After the Tong Xing clan came the You Chao clan, to whom the nine heads of the world all submitted in reverence. The You Chao clan produced the Sui Ren clan; the Sui Ren clan produced Fu Xi.

The *River Chart* and *Records of the Three and Five Calendars* state: After the Human Sovereign, there were the Five Dragons clan, Sui Ren clan, Da Ting clan, Bai Huang clan, Central clan, Juan Xu clan, Li Lu clan, Li Lian clan, He Xu clan, Zun Lu clan, Hun Dun clan, Hao Ying clan, You Chao clan, Zhu Xiang clan, Ge Tian clan, Yin Kang clan, and Yuan Huai clan, though their surnames and generational orders are unknown.

The *Three Tombs* records the Heavenly Sovereign and Fu Xi clan. The *Divination Texts* state: The Sovereign said: I command you, Xiang, to occupy my Flying Dragon position, to produce my diagrams and texts, and to relay my decrees to the four directions above and below, without error or neglect. Later, the Hao Ying clan presented a calendar to the Lord, saying: The calendar begins with *jia-yin*. The Sovereign said: The *jia* day and *yin* hour—wood rules at *mao*. In the second month, he assembled the people at the Teaching Transmission Terrace to announce the beginning of *jia-yin*. Later, the Nü Wa and Yuan Huai clans assisted the Lord’s right; the Grand Minister Gong Gong and the Minister Huang Gen served above and below. The Flying Dragon Zhu Xiang clan and the Hidden Dragon Hao Ying clan stood at the Lord’s left and right. The Li Lu clan resided in the north; the He Xu clan in the south; the Kun Lian clan in the west; the Ge Tian clan in the east; the Yin Kang clan below. The governors of the nine provinces each led their people, dwelling in the outer regions.

The Sovereign said: Li Lu’s son, occupy my Flying Dragon position. Oversee the nurturing of grasses and trees, open the paths of springs and sources, and do not lose the proper seasons. He said: Da Ting’s son, oversee my dwellings. Observe the people who have no homes, instruct them to lend strength, and together build their residences, so none suffer from cold. He said: Yin Kang’s son, oversee my waters and earth, so the people’s dwellings are not swept away, and they diligently follow the land routes. He said: Hun Dun’s son, occupy my Descending Dragon position, and attend solely to the people. He said: Kun Lian’s son, oversee my blades and axes, and do not let wild beasts, rhinoceroses, tigers, and the like harm the people.

The Sovereign said: If the lords of the four directions all heed my words, the world will know no sorrow; if they cherish the people, their positions will not be imperiled. He further said: Sons, do not cling to ease—find ease only in the people’s ease. When the people are at ease, you are at ease; when the people are in peril, you are in peril. Let this be ever in your thoughts.

According to the *Three Tombs* texts, Fuxi was the Heavenly Sovereign of Later Ages, with Nüwa and Yuanhuai as his successors, and Zhuxiang and Haoying as his descendants. Gonggong and Huanggen served as his ministers, while Lilu, Hexu, Kunlian, Getian, Dating, Yinkang, and Hundun were all his divine attendants. Within the realm, his six ministers divided their duties to govern the state; beyond it, they served as lords of the four directions to shepherd the people—these were the so-called Nine Heads. Yet all were contemporaries, with no distinction of eras. Why, then, do historical records arrange them in sequence? Perhaps after Fuxi’s passing, his descendants and the Nine Heads’ ministers all enjoyed long lives, taking turns as rulers. Or perhaps the descendants of his ministers were enfeoffed as lords, adopting their ancestors’ names as their own.

The *Han Shi Waizhuan* states that since ancient times, over ten thousand clans have performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices on Mount Tai and Liangfu, yet when Confucius observed them, he could not recognize them all. Guanzi also records: "Seventy-two clans performed the Feng sacrifice on Mount Tai in antiquity, of whom I, Yiwu, recognize only twelve." The first among them was the Lord of WuHuai, suggesting that the sequence of pre-Fuxi dynasties is largely unknowable.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals of Hua* records that from the opening of heaven and earth to the capture of the lin, a span of 3,276,000 years elapsed, divided into ten epochs:
1. The Nine Heads Epoch,
2. The Five Dragons Epoch,
3. The Sheti Epoch,
4. The HeXiong Epoch,
5. The LianTong Epoch,
6. The ShuMing Epoch,
7. The XiuFei Epoch,
8. The YinTi Epoch,
9. The ShanTong Epoch,
10. The LiuQi Epoch.

The LiuQi Epoch corresponds to the time of the Yellow Emperor, who established the nine epochs. Counting backward from the thirty-ninth year of Duke Jing of Zhou—the twelfth year of Duke Ai of Lu, the gengshen year when the lin was captured—to the first year of the Yellow Emperor (dinghai), only 3,930 years have passed. Extending this reckoning to the dawn of creation, there should be 3,272,000 years, during which the eras of rulers remain unrecorded. Though scattered references appear in the works of the various masters and apocryphal texts, they are doubtful and contradictory, lacking definitive resolution. For now, we set them aside without further discussion.

Fuxi, the Great Bright One (Taihao), bore the surname Feng and embodied the virtue of Wood. He first created the calendar, designating the jia-yin year as the inaugural year. Nüwa succeeded him, and their descendants ruled for 45,600 years. The *River Chart of Successive Surnames* states: Fuxi was the son of Suiren, born by the wind, hence the surname Feng. A dragon-horse bore the chart, and he first drew the Eight Trigrams. He commanded the Flying Dragon clan to create the six scripts and the Hidden Dragon clan to devise the calendar. Fuxi smelted metal to forge tools, taught the people to cook food, transformed the Nine Heads into Nine Governors, established offices based on the dragon’s emergence, and composed music upon the phoenix’s arrival. The people of the world called him the Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Bright One. During Fuxi’s reign, the Old Lord descended to the mortal realm, dwelling in the wilderness under the name Yuhua Zi.

The *Tang Annals* record: When Fuxi ruled the world, our Most High, in order to broadly save all, descended as his teacher. He taught him to draw the Eight Trigrams, instructed him in the division of the Three Powers, assisted him in creating written characters to replace knotted cords, and established systems to supplant the governance of rope-tying.

Zhurong, the Flame Emperor, bore the surname Jiang and embodied the virtue of Fire. His reign began in the bing-chen year, and he first taught the people pottery and smelting, hence the title Flame Emperor. According to the *Records of Posthumous Names* in the *Book of Rites*, Zhurong preceded Shennong. My annotations, however, place Shennong first. Upon closer examination, Zhurong was the ancestor of the Flame Emperor, ruling by the virtue of Fire, and thus should not come after Shennong. Here, we follow the *Book of Rites* as authoritative. His descendant, Li of the Gaoyang clan, served as Fire Minister, hence also called Zhurong, and remains the god presiding over fire in the south. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: "His emperor is the Flame Emperor; his spirit is Zhurong." Thus, Zhurong’s status as the progenitor of the Fire virtue is clear.

At that time, the Old Lord descended to Jiyin under the name Guangshou Zi.

Shennong, the Lianshan clan, was a descendant of Zhurong. He first taught the people to cultivate the hundred grains, hence the title Divine Farmer. His descendants ruled for 530 years. The *River Chart of Successive Surnames* calls him the Human Sovereign.

At that time, the Old Lord descended to Jiyin under the name Dacheng Zi. The *Tang Annals* record: When the Lianshan clan ruled the world, our Most High, bending to the needs of the age, descended as the emperor’s teacher. He bestowed upon him the Five Movements, divided the Four Seasons, assisted him in governing the myriad affairs, and enlightened him in distinguishing the hundred grains. He transformed the customs of drinking blood and eating raw flesh, replaced the sounds of clapping earth and pounding soil, abolished cave-dwellings and tree-nests, and established proper halls and chambers. He taught the people to smelt metal and mold clay, to hull millet and butcher pigs, to craft plows and spades to aid the multitudes, and to practice pottery and metallurgy for the benefit of all things. Heaven rained grain as an auspicious sign, and the earth sprouted abundant harvests.

The Yellow Emperor, the Youxiong clan, bore the surname Gongsun and embodied the virtue of Earth. His reign began in the ding-hai year.

The lineage continued for a total of one thousand five hundred and twenty years. According to the *Hetu Daxing Ji*, he was titled the Earthly Sovereign. At that time, the Venerable Lord descended into the world and dwelled on Mount Kongtong, where he was known as Master Guangcheng. The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Youxiong clan ruled the world, our Supreme One concealed himself within Mount Kongtong, releasing his mind beyond the boundless void. The Emperor personally descended with brush and reins, offering rites to honor the master-disciple relationship. Having adjusted his robes and hastened to the corner, he knelt to inquire of the Dao. At that time, Jian’gang oppressed the people with cruelty, and Chiyou stirred rebellion. The Way transformed fish and turtles into soldiers to aid the royal army, and clouds and mist into divine spirits to secretly bolster the ranks. Thus, weapons were quelled at Zhuolu, and spears were laid down at Banquan. He roamed eastward to the lands of Qingqiu, journeyed north to the borders of Hongdi, received the cinnabar scriptures in the Jade Chamber, and ascended to the azure heavens at Dinghu. Since the *Quyi* grass grew and the *Mojia* plant reappeared, who but the Great Dao could have brought forth such wonders?"

According to the *Yuwei Jing*, there are three types of Three Sovereigns, distinguished as anterior, middle, and posterior, hence the term Nine Sovereigns. The *Dongshen Dayou Jing* states: "Each of the Three Sovereigns reigned for three thousand six hundred years." The *Xiaoyou Jing* says: "Each of the Three Sovereigns reigned for ten thousand eighty years." Examining these two accounts, the *Dayou Jing* refers only to one generation of Three Sovereigns, with each sovereign reigning for three thousand six hundred years. The *Xiaoyou Jing*, however, encompasses three generations of Three Sovereigns, with each sovereign reigning for ten thousand eighty years. If we consider all three generations and nine sovereigns together, the total spans thirty-two thousand four hundred years. Some texts mention eighteen thousand years, likely due to a scribal error where "hundred" was mistaken for "thousand." Now, according to the *Laozi Neizhuan*, the figures align with those in the *Dayou* and *Xiaoyou* scriptures. As for the anterior Three Sovereigns and the middle Three Sovereigns, each spanning ninety-nine billion myriad years, this refers to the vast measure of a kalpa, not merely the lifespans of the Three Sovereigns themselves.

Regarding the later sovereigns, historical records vary widely. For instance, the *Dongshen Jing* and Xiang Jun limit the Three Sovereigns to the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign, while the *Sanfen Shu* identifies Fuxi as the Heavenly Sovereign, Shennong as the Human Sovereign, and the Yellow Emperor as the Earthly Sovereign. Huangfu Mi’s commentary on the *Chunqiu Yundou Shu*, as well as Zheng Xuan and Gao You’s annotations on the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, list Fuxi, Nüwa, and Shennong as the Three Sovereigns. The *Liji Yihao Ji* names Fuxi, Zhurong, and Shennong as the Three Sovereigns. Kong Anguo, Wei Zhao, and Tao Hongjing identify Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor as the Three Sovereigns. The *Shangshu Dayuan*, Ying Shao, and Qiao Zhou list Suiren, Fuxi, and Shennong as the Three Sovereigns. The Liaoshi records Youchao, Suiren, and Yixi as the Three Sovereigns. The *Dixi Pu*, *Zhong Jing*, *Chusai Ji*, and *Laixiang Ji* name Fuxi, Shennong, and Zhurong as the Three Sovereigns. Given these discrepancies, it is difficult to hastily adjudicate. Emperor Wu of Liang, however, designated Fuxi, Shennong, and Suiren as the Three Sovereigns, and the Yellow Emperor, Shaohao, Diku, Dizhi, and Yao as the Five Emperors, asserting that Shun was neither one of the Three August Ones nor one of the Five Emperors but belonged to a fourth era alongside the Three Kings—a theory that is particularly untenable. Through the ages, opinions have remained divided without consensus.

Shaohao, of the Jintian clan, was a descendant of the Yellow Emperor and embodied the virtue of Metal. His reign began in the xin-wei year. His lineage continued for four hundred years. The Venerable Lord descended again upon Mount Kongtong, where he was known as the Responsive Six-in-One, or Master of the Great Ultimate. The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Jintian clan ruled the world, our Supreme One descended upon a nine-dragon chariot to serve as his teacher, known as Master of the Great Ultimate. He expounded the canons of solemn reverence, teaching the emperor to align with the seasons and welcome the qi, to manifest harmony with the divine spirits. The feathered tribes displayed their auspiciousness, and he appointed them as the Avian Officials, dividing them into nine avian ranks to govern the hundred legions. The sun and moon conjoined like jade discs to display their numinosity, and the phoenix bore the celestial chart to reveal its patterns. All these marvels arose from the Supreme Dao, illuminating the emperor’s majestic rule."

Zhuanxu...

The Gaoyang clan, surnamed Ji, held the virtue of Water. They reigned for seventy-eight years, beginning in the xinmao year. The Venerable Lord descended upon Mount Heng, known as the Red Essence Master.

The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Gaoyang clan ruled the world, our Supreme One taught them to resolve conflicts and unblock obstructions, to govern the state and pacify the people, to purge the Nine Li tribes, and to illuminate the Eight Kai. There were the fierce and grotesque, with wild purple beards like dragons, and the chieftains with serpentine bodies and crimson hair. Their strength could not prevail, and their heads shattered against the mountains. The heavens tilted to the northwest, causing the sun and moon to traverse westward; the earth sank in the southeast, compelling the rivers and seas to flow eastward. The Supreme One summoned the Six Jia spirits, commanding the hundred numina, instructing them in the scriptures of subtle words and teaching them the Way of Great Compliance. Riding the swift chariot of azure vapor, he journeyed to the dark mounds; driving the white-glass carriage, he roamed afar, reaching the coiled trees."

**Emperor Ku** of the Gaoxin clan, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, held the virtue of Wood. He reigned for seventy years, beginning in the jiyou year. The Venerable Lord descended into the world, dwelling by the riverside, known as the Recorded Chart Master.

The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Gaoxin clan ruled the world, our Supreme One spread the Dao and disseminated transformation, aiding the age as its teacher. He discoursed on the wondrous words of the *Yellow Court*, concealing the sun and evading the moon, bearing the auspicious title of Recorded Chart. He relocated cities and shifted capitals, established the mandate of the Nine Provinces, and composed the *Six Harmonies* music. He enfeoffed Goumang to assist the Azure Emperor, commanded Rushou to aid the White Realm, sealed Mount Tai with golden mud, and illuminated the world by unveiling the jade mirror. He drank from the Well of Great Vitality and wandered the Land of Unending Day."

**Emperor Yao** of the Taotang clan, surnamed Yiqi, held the virtue of Fire. He reigned for seventy years, beginning in the wuxu year. The Venerable Lord descended into the world, residing on Mount Gushe, known as the Accomplished Master.

The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Taotang clan ruled the world, our Supreme One temporarily bestowed the perfect governance, descending to serve as teacher. He expounded the scriptures of mysterious virtue and the Dao to rectify the profound transformation, responding to the auspicious name of Cinnabar Mound, aspiring to rank among the Cinnabar Hills. Clad in a robe of coarse fur, he dined on simple fare, sitting upright upon the earthen steps. Draped in a crane-feather cloak, he drank the flowing rosy clouds, his thoughts congealing in the Jasper Gardens."

**Emperor Shun** of the Youyu clan, surnamed Yao, held the virtue of Earth. He acted as regent for thirty years and reigned for fifty, beginning in the wushen year. The Venerable Lord descended into the world, dwelling in Heyang, known as the Longevity Master.

The *Tang Ji* states: "When the Youyu clan ruled the world, our Supreme One discoursed on the principle of non-action and expounded the scriptures of separation and union. The Three Miao tribes were pacified, the Four Culprits all submitted, the hundred offices followed their seasons, and the Five Canons were revered. He bestowed the luminous pearl of the radiant spirits and granted the jade of resplendent brilliance."

According to the *Confucian Family Sayings*, Ji Kangzi asked: "I have heard the names of the Five Emperors but do not know their reality. May I ask what the Five Emperors are?"

Confucius replied: "Formerly, I heard from Lao Dan that Heaven possesses the Five Phases—Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth—which divide the seasons and transform and nurture the myriad things. Their spirits are called the Five Emperors. The ancient kings changed their titles with each new dynasty, taking the Five Phases as their model. The Five Phases alternate in rulership, cycling through generation and completion, thus embodying their significance. Therefore, the enlightened kings of old, upon their deaths, were matched with the Five Phases. Thus, Taihao was matched with Wood, the Flame Emperor with Fire, the Yellow Emperor with Earth, Shaohao with Metal, and Zhuanxu with Water."

Kangzi asked: "Why did Taihao begin with Wood?"

Confucius replied: "The Five Phases take effect beginning with Wood. Wood corresponds to the East, where the myriad things first emerge. Therefore, the kings modeled themselves upon it, first ruling the world with the virtue of Wood, and thereafter following the sequence of the generating Phases."

Kangzi asked: "I have heard that Goumang is the Director of Wood, Zhu Rong the Director of Fire, Rushou the Director of Metal, Xuanming the Director of Water, and Houtu the Director of Earth. These are the lords of the Five Phases, yet they are not called Emperors. Why is this?"

Confucius replied: "The Five Directors are the official titles of the Five Phases. The Five Phases assist in completing the work of the Supreme Deity and are called the Five Emperors. The descendants of Taihao and the others are matched with them, and thus are also called Emperors, following their titles. Shaohao’s son, Chong, became Goumang; his son, Gai, became Rushou; his sons, Xiu and Xi, became Xuanming. Zhuanxu’s son, Li, became Zhu Rong. Gonggong’s son, Gou Long, became Houtu. These five each took their abilities as their official duties, living as the highest dukes and, upon death, becoming revered spirits. They are called the Five Sacrifices and cannot be equated with the Emperors."

Kangzi asked: "Taotang, Youyu, the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties alone are not matched with the Five Emperors. Is it that their virtue did not reach the ancients, or is there a limit?"

Confucius replied: "Many in antiquity governed the waters and lands and sowed the hundred grains. Only Gou Long was jointly worshipped at the Earth Altar, and Qi became the Spirit of Millet. Successive ages honored them without daring to alter this, making clear that they could not be equaled. Thus, from Taihao down to Zhuanxu, corresponding to the Five Phases, the number of kings was not limited to five, yet only five were matched with the Five Emperors. This shows that their virtue cannot be multiplied."

In the *Comprehensive Records Outside the Mirror* by Liu Daoyuan of the Song dynasty, it is noted in the annals of Shun: "The *Six Classics* do not mention the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, or Three Kings. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: 'After the Fuxi clan perished, the Shennong clan arose. After the Shennong clan perished, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun arose.' Successive generations changed rulers without numbering them as three or five. Some take Fuxi to Shun as the Five Emperors, but since Confucius never spoke of this, it cannot be attached to arbitrary conjecture. The *Guanzi* states: 'Those who illuminate the One are Sovereigns; those who discern the Dao are Emperors; those who penetrate virtue are Kings; those who scheme and win in warfare are Hegemons.' Kong Yingda said that the *Guanzi* may have been recorded by later hands and is not the original text."

Some argue that the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* are mere allegories and fantastical fabrications, yet scholars of the Qin and Han dynasties revered their literary style and discourse, hence the proliferation of references to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—unaware that no such figures existed in antiquity. Though their arguments may seem plausible, when examined against historical facts, they do not constitute a coherent theory. Moreover, the reigns and chronologies of the emperors they record, when compared with dynastic annals, official histories, and astronomical calendars, are riddled with discrepancies; the *ganzhi* calculations likewise diverge. Whether this stems from scribal errors, a deliberate attempt to distinguish themselves from others, or merely an oversight of details in pursuit of broader truths remains uncertain.

Consider, for instance, Zai Wo’s inquiry to Confucius about ancient traditions, to which the Master replied that he had only heard fragments of such accounts. How much less reliable, then, are those whose talents fall short of the sages, separated from antiquity by even greater spans of time? When Ji Kangzi asked about the Five Emperors, Confucius responded with what he had once heard from Lao Dan, never once asserting that such figures never existed. This reveals the sage’s reverence for and devotion to antiquity.

Only Sima Qian, in his *Imperial Annals and Tables*, states: "Scholars have long spoken of the Five Emperors, yet the *Book of Documents* records only from Yao onward. The various schools’ accounts of the Yellow Emperor are unrefined, and gentlemen of refinement find them difficult to discuss. What Confucius transmitted—Zai Yu’s inquiries into the *Virtues of the Five Emperors* and the *Genealogies of the Emperors*—some Ru scholars do not pass down." I have traveled west to Kongtong, north past Zhuolu, east to the sea, and south across the Yangtze and Huai rivers; wherever I went, elders spoke of the lands where the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun once dwelled, their customs and teachings differing, yet all hewing close to ancient texts. In the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and *Discourses of the States*, the elucidation of the *Virtues of the Five Emperors* and *Genealogies of the Emperors* is evident. If one does not delve deeply, the manifestations therein may seem unsubstantial. Yet though records are incomplete, traces of their legacy often appear in other texts. Without diligent study, profound reflection, and an intuitive grasp of their meaning, it is indeed difficult to discuss such matters with those of shallow learning and limited knowledge.

Sima Qian exhaustively studied all available texts and extensively investigated ancient sites, making him a paragon of historiography.

**Xia Yu** of the Si clan, associated with the virtue of Metal, ascended the throne in the year *wuxu*, establishing the first month as *yin*. His descendants ruled for a total of 432 years. The Venerable Lord descended to the world, dwelling on Mount Shang, where he was known as Master Zhenxing. The *Tang Annals* state: "When the Xia Hou clan ruled the world, our Most High aided in rectifying the Dao of kingship, serving as the emperor’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of virtue and conduct, which became the laws of the state."

**Tang of Shang**, of the Zi clan, associated with the virtue of Water, ascended the throne in the year *gengxu*, establishing the first month as *chou*, and reigned for thirteen years. His descendants ruled for a total of 613 years. The Venerable Lord descended to the world, dwelling on Mount Qian, where he was known as Master Xize. The *Tang Annals* state: "When Cheng Tang ruled the world, our Most High temporarily departed the Left Ultimate, descending to serve as the king’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of longevity and embodied the Dao of spontaneity."

The above accounts are cross-referenced in the *Genealogical Charts of the Emperors*, *Century of Emperors and Kings*, *Scripture of the Great Possession of the Cavernous Spirit*, *Jade Calendar Scripture*, *Records of the Frontier*, *Geographical Records*, *Qiao Zhou’s Investigations into Ancient History*, *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, and *Illustrated Records of Commanderies and States*.

Though the Venerable Lord divided his body to descend and establish teachings in accordance with the times, he concealed himself once his work was done, leaving no record of his birth in the world.

**Nan Geng** ascended the throne in the year *yihai* and reigned for twenty-nine years.
**Yang Jia** ascended the throne in the year *jiachen* and reigned for eighteen years.

In the seventeenth year of his reign, the year *gengshen*, the Venerable Lord divided his spirit from the Great Clarity Realm, entering the womb of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden.

**Pan Geng** ascended the throne in the year *renxu* and reigned for twenty-nine years.
**Xiao Xin** ascended the throne in the year *xinmao* and reigned for twenty-one years.
**Xiao Yi** ascended the throne in the year *renzhi* and reigned for twenty years.
**Wu Ding** ascended the throne in the year *renshen* and reigned for fifty-nine years, known as High Ancestor.

In the ninth year of his reign, the year *gengchen*, on the fifteenth day of the second month (the first month of the *yin* cycle), the full moon of the second month of Shang—now celebrated as the Lantern Festival—the *Comprehensive Mirror External Records* notes: "Before the Xia dynasty, all regarded the *yin* month as the first month. When Tang overthrew the Xia, he changed the first month to *chou*." The Venerable Lord was born. From his conception in the seventeenth year of Yang Jia’s reign to his birth, eighty-one years had passed.

Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of Transcendents* states that Laozi was born during the Shang dynasty. Ji Kang and Huangfu Mi claim he was born at the end of the Shang. The Tang dynasty celebrated his birthday as the True Origin Festival. Yue Penggui’s *Records* state: "During the reign of High Ancestor of Shang, as King Wen of Zhou began his *Changes*, divine radiance flowed into a jade embryo, auspicious hues coalesced into golden bones. Unbroken and uncut, he gestated for over eighty years before descending into the world, his birth delayed by more than twenty thousand days."

In the forty-third year, *jiayin*, the Venerable Lord descended, riding a white deer, and ascended to the heavens from the treetop of a cypress in the courtyard. Today, the deer’s hoofprints from his ascension remain at the Supreme Clarity Palace in Bozhou.

**Reigns of Shang Kings:**
- Year one of Zu Geng, *xinhai*: reigned seventeen years.
- Year one of Zu Jia, *wuzǐ*: reigned seventeen years.
- Year one of Lin Xin, *yǐsì*: reigned six years.
- Year one of Kang Ding, *xīnhài*: reigned twenty-one years.
- Year one of Wu Yi, *rénshēn*: reigned four years. He disrespected Heaven and was struck dead by violent thunder.
- Year one of Tai Ding, *bǐngzǐ*: reigned four years.
- Year one of Di Yi, *gēngchén*: reigned twenty-seven years.
- Year one of Xin Zhou, *dīngwèi*: reigned twenty-seven years, ending in *guǐyǒu*.

In the twenty-first year, *dīngmǎo*, the Venerable Lord descended upon the southern slopes of Mount Qi, styled as the Master of Xieyi. King Wen of Zhou, then Lord of the West, summoned him to serve as Archivist of the Royal Treasury. The *Generational Records* state: "Laozi served as Archivist Beneath the Pillars in the Shang." Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Analects* notes: "Lao Peng was a virtuous minister of Shang." Kong Yingda’s subcommentary clarifies: "Lao refers to Lao Dan."

King Wu of Zhou, of the Ji clan, embodied the virtue of Wood. He established the first month as *zǐ* and began his reign in *guǐyǒu*, overthrowing Shang and ascending the throne. His dynasty endured for ninety-six years, with his descendants ruling for eight hundred and sixty-five years in succession. The Venerable Lord was then appointed Archivist Beneath the Pillars.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* and Liu Xin’s *Seven Summaries* both state he served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury in Zhou. Ge Hong and the *Inner Transmission* record: "He was Archivist of the Royal Treasury during King Wen’s reign and Archivist Beneath the Pillars during King Wu’s reign." Only Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of Transcendents* claims: "Born in the Shang, he served as Archivist Beneath the Pillars in Zhou, later becoming Archivist of the Royal Treasury." Since he was born in the Shang, his tenure as both archivists must have occurred during King Wen’s era. However, the sequence—whether he served first or later—remains uncertain.

According to Yang Xiong’s *Regional Speech*: "I have heard that the records of the *Faji* and *Xuan* offices, along with the books of Qin’s archives, were all stored in the chambers of Zhou and Qin." The *Zhuangzi* also states: "Confucius intended to deposit books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised, 'I have heard that the Archivist of Zhou’s Treasury, Lao Dan, is in charge of the archives. Since you wish to store books there, why not seek his counsel?' Confucius, intending to deposit the books, approached Laozi because he had once held the office of archivist and thus knew the treasury’s affairs. His past conduct and experience made him the natural choice."

The *Rites of Zhou* enumerates five types of historians: the Royal Historian, Grand Historian, Inner Historian, Outer Historian, and Censor. Feudal lords also maintained state historians. The *Book of Rites* records: "When the ruler acts, the Left Historian records it; when he speaks, the Right Historian records it." The Left Historian observed ritual, while the Inner Historian and Grand Historian oversaw all historians, preserving the records of the Four Directions. The books of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were stored in the treasury, hence the title "Archivist of the Royal Treasury."

During the reign of King You of Zhou, Boyang Fu was active. Tang Gu’s commentary identifies him as Laozi, the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. During the reign of King Lie, the Grand Historian Jie—also Laozi—served. The Grand Historian was a senior minister of Zhou, overseeing the five historians. Responsible for recording words and deeds, he stood beneath the pillars in the ruler’s presence, hence the name of the office. Wei Zhao explains: "Boyang held the rank of Grandee, serving as Grand Historian, which was a position of lower grandee."

The *Records of the Grand Historian* notes that Zhang Cang, who excelled in calendrical studies, served as Censor during the Qin, overseeing the archives beneath the pillars. According to the *Rites of Zhou*, the Censor assisted in documentation and instruction, managing the archives and records under the Inner Historian’s purview. This Qin office differed from Zhou’s system.

The *Generational Records* state: "In the Shang, he was Archivist of the Royal Treasury; in Zhou, he was Archivist Beneath the Pillars." Since King Wen, as a vassal, served the Shang and could not yet be considered ruler of an independent Zhou, it is certain he first served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury and later as Archivist Beneath the Pillars. Liu Xiang’s account suggests Lao Dan initially served as Grand Historian but, due to his quiet and retiring nature, was reassigned to another historian’s post. By Laozi’s time, he had retired again. During King Lie’s reign, he returned as Grand Historian, serving multiple Zhou kings in a single lifetime. Thus, he held various historian roles, with the sequence of Archivist of the Royal Treasury and Archivist Beneath the Pillars differing.

Ban Gu writes: "Lao Dan was Zhou’s elder historian, who wandered beneath the pillars, investigating the ways of longevity." According to Ban’s account, he served as a historian across multiple reigns, hence the title "elder historian."

During the Sui dynasty, the Inner Historian Xue Daoheng composed the *Eulogy of the Temple Courtyard*, whose preface states: "From Fuxi to the Zhou, spanning successive dynasties, he witnessed transformations in substance and name. During the reigns of Kings Wen and Wu, he held the offices of Archivist of the Royal Treasury and Archivist Beneath the Pillars. Though courts and markets changed, his appearance remained unaltered. King Cheng..."

In the first year of his reign, the cyclical year wuyin, he ruled for forty-seven years. The Venerable Lord still served as Archivist Beneath the Pillars, styled Master of Scriptural Completion. He transmitted the Dao to the Duke of Zhou, then journeyed to the westernmost lands of Da Qin and the realms of Zhuqian, where he was known as the Ancient Master.

According to the *Inner Traditions of Laozi*: In the time of Fuxi, he was styled Master Yuhua; during the era of Shennong, Master Chuanyu; under Zhurong, Master Guangshou; in the age of the Yellow Emperor, Master Guangcheng; during Zhuanxu’s reign, Master Chijing; under Emperor Ku, Master Lutu; in the time of Yao, Master Wucheng; under Shun, Master Yinshou; during the Xia dynasty under Yu, Master Ningzhen; styled Master Zhenxing in the time of Tang; and Master Xize during the reigns of Kings Wen and Wu—altogether serving as preceptor to twelve sovereigns.

The *Stele of the Pavilion of Clarity and Emptiness*, composed by Xiao Ziyun, Gentleman-in-Attendance of the Yellow Gate during the Liang dynasty, also states: "The Great Void is vast and boundless, transcending speech and form. Responding to stimuli, it acquires names in accordance with things. When Boyang descended in pregnancy, his hair was already white as frost. Yao called him Wucheng; Shun, Yinshou. Chijing was born in the time of Zhuanxu; Lutu emerged from Shennong. Embracing the One and containing the Origin, he became the foundation of kingship." It further declares: "Roaming the spirits above the Nine Heavens, guiding the hundred essences beneath the towering gates, majestic and boundless—none can name him."

Old records uniformly style the Venerable Lord as Master Dacheng during the time of Shennong and Master Lutu under Emperor Ku. This stele alone asserts that Lutu emerged from Shennong, while the *Inner Traditions* calls him Master Chuanyu during Shennong’s era. Surely there must be minor discrepancies; the authoritative texts should be taken as standard.

Ge Hong, in his *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, casts doubt on the claim that he served as preceptor to successive emperors, arguing that such accounts derive from fragmentary writings rather than the canonical scriptures of transcendence. He further contends that it would be incongruous for one to abandon the clarity of the Dao and enter the foul defilements, or to forsake celestial office for mortal rank. He states: "Where there is Heaven and Earth, there is the unfolding of the Dao, and those who guard it appear in every generation. Why must it always be the same Laozi?" Such views stem from later scholars’ penchant for novelty and their desire to exalt Laozi, hence these assertions.

Yin Wencao, Abbot of the Temple of Heavenly Veneration during the Tang, once composed a refutation, saying: "Ge Hong’s *Biographies* aim to dispel delusion. The Venerable Lord arose through self-cultivation, intending to instruct and guide later generations, urging them to strive diligently. If one claims Laozi was a perfected being, others will emulate him with zeal; if one calls him a divine spirit, he becomes unattainable. This is merely Ge Hong’s personal conjecture, for he fails to recognize that from the very beginning of creation, some attained the Dao through study, while others descended as natural sages to serve as teachers, transmitting the teachings in accordance with circumstances."

The *Scripture of Fixed Resolve* states: "In the beginning, when the Heavenly Worthy established the Great Compassion, he acted in accordance with spontaneity, aligning with principle without conscious effort. His profound awakening was natural, devoid of written words. He compiled scriptures to instruct future generations." From this perspective, the Venerable Lord’s natural mastery of the Dao and his role as preceptor across the ages—what doubt can there be? As the Father of Great Compassion, why would he refuse to descend in humility, harmonizing his light with the foul defilements?

Laozi said to Guan Yinzi: "Since the earliest ages, my transformations have been as numerous as grains of sand. Each movement leaves a record, and I have found it exceedingly arduous." The *Canon of Supreme Mystery* also states: "Laozi accumulated learning through countless cycles, ascending to the rank of supreme sage. His responses were boundless, beyond all reckoning." In recent generations, he manifested his transformations, being born at the end of the Yin dynasty.

Yu Xuan’s *Record of the Northern Frontier* states: "Laozi concentrated his spirit in the ministry of Supreme Mystery, dispersing his numinous radiance to teach in every age." Cui Yuan’s *Record of Lai Village* on Mount Crane says: "Laozi’s manifestations appear in every generation." The Transcendent Lord Ge states: "Before the opening of creation, he descended as preceptor to the nations, continuing without cease." Wen Shi, Gui Gu, and Zhang Fuhan all declare: "The Venerable Lord existed before the Great Non-Being, traversing Heaven and Earth in ways beyond enumeration." How can these be dismissed as fragmentary writings or the shallow views of later scholars? Ge Hong simply failed to consider this.

King Kang.

In the first year *yichou* (of his reign), he ruled for twenty-six years. The Venerable Lord returned once more to the Zhou, styled as Guo Shuzi, and again served as Archivist Beneath the Pillars.

In the first year *xinmao* of King Zhao’s reign, he ruled for fifty years. The Venerable Lord resigned his post and returned to Bo. In the twenty-third year *guichou*, on the fifteenth day of the fifth month (*renwu*), the Venerable Lord passed westward through Hangu Pass, where he transmitted the Dao to the Pass Prefect Yin Xi. Some say that though the Venerable Lord’s departure from the pass occurred in the *guichou* year of Zhou, the fifth month, *renwu* day, it was not during King Zhao’s reign. Others claim it was during King You’s time, but upon examination, King You ascended in the *gengshen* year and was overthrown by the Quanrong in his eleventh year, during which there was no *guichou* year. Still others assert it was the fortieth year of King Xuan, *guichou*, the eighteenth day of the fifth month, *renwu*; yet reckoning the years, in the forty-third year *bingchen*, the Venerable Lord was by the Wei River, where he warned King Xuan of Zhou’s impending decline. In the second year of King You, the Three Rivers quaked, and Laozi said, “Zhou will perish.” King You was the son of King Xuan. If the Venerable Lord had departed the pass in the fortieth year of King Xuan, he could not have still been by the Wei River in the forty-third year, nor could he have witnessed the quaking of the Three Rivers during King You’s reign. In the forty-third year of King Ping, the year was also *guichou*, but the fifth month had no *renwu* day. Yao Changqian’s *Annals of Emperors and Kings* states that in the tenth year *bingyin* of King Jing, Confucius became a disciple, and in the thirty-second year *guichou* of King Jing, he transmitted the Dao at the pass. Yet Confucius was born in the *gengxu* year of King Ling, and in the *bingyin* year of King Jing, he was only seventeen—hardly old enough to have studied under Laozi. Moreover, when King Mu journeyed west, he had already heard of Perfected Yin encountering Laozi, attaining the Dao, and ascending in flight. Filled with reverence for this legacy, he then built the Louguan Terrace, established Daoist priests, and instituted sacrificial rites. Thus, it is clear that Laozi’s transmission at the pass did not occur after King Mu’s time. Only the *Inner Transmission* aligns with the words of the Transcendent Lord Ge; all other conflicting accounts ultimately violate reason and principle and cannot be cited as fact.

In the twenty-fourth year *jiayin*, Laozi transmitted the Dao to Yin Xi, bestowing upon him the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Thereupon, he ascended to Heaven from a small hill south of Yin Xi’s residence. At that time, a five-colored light pierced the Purple Tenuity, and the well waters all overflowed. From the ninth year of High Ancestor of Shang to this time, a total of 274 years had passed.

In the twenty-fifth year *yimao*, the Venerable Lord once more divided his body and descended to be born in the household of Li Taiguan in the state of Shu. Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Transcendents* from the Former Han states: “Laozi was born in the Shang era, served as Archivist Beneath the Pillars in Zhou, and later became Keeper of the Archives, known at the time as the Reclusive Gentleman. Confucius met him and, recognizing his sageliness, took him as his teacher. Riding a blue ox-drawn carriage, he departed for the Great Qin, where the Pass Prefect Yin awaited and welcomed him.” Ji Kang and Huangfu Mi both state that Laozi was born at the end of the Shang, while Ge Xiaoxian claims that during the Zhou, he spiritually entered the womb of Li’s mother—referring precisely to the time of his descent into the household of Li Taiguan. Some argue that as the Shang’s mandate neared its end and Zhou’s had already risen, he was born at the close of the Shang; why then speak of his spiritual transformation into this womb during the Zhou? The matter remains unresolved.

In the twenty-seventh year *dingsi*, the Venerable Lord met with Perfected Yin Xi at the Green Ram Market, preparing to depart and transform the Hu. Thus, the *Tang Annals* state: “The Green Ram Market was the second place where the Supreme Heavenly Thearch descended to be born.” From the time the Dao of Shang was obstructed and the virtue of Zhou declined, he passed through the office of Keeper of the Archives, mingling with the world, then abandoned the post of Archivist Beneath the Pillars to conceal his traces. Binding his robes, he departed the Wei Gate and crossed westward through Hangu Pass. It also states: “After a thousand days’ appointed time, they met again for a brief while. About to leave Shu, he sought to transform the customs of the Hu, journeying far to the Flowing Sands, long altering the rough ways of the western barbarians, reaching Shendu and the lands of the western Hu, where woolly and feathered peoples became his guests. He taught the kings of Fanduo and Azhu.” Furthermore, Emperor Ming of Wei composed the *Eulogy for the Venerable Lord*, saying: “Deeply pitying later generations, he descended in Chen to serve as Archivist Beneath the Pillars in Zhou, enduring nine hundred boundless years. Returning to Kunlun, his transforming influence spread to the lands of the Hu, then to Shushen, and later to Tianzhu, whereupon he departed.” The *Wei Lue: Account of the Western Rong* and the *Northern History: Account of the Western Regions* both state: “Five hundred *li* west of Yutian is the Pimo Monastery, said to be where Laozi transformed the Hu.” This is recorded in the *Tang Comprehensive Institutions*.

In the twenty-eighth year *wuwu*, the Venerable Lord and Perfected Yin Xi descended upon Qiling Mountain in Tianshui. Today, in Qinzhou, the Western Ascent Terrace and the Hall of the Sage’s Countenance both remain.

In the first year *xinsi* of King Mu’s reign, he ruled for fifty-five years and lived to the age of one hundred and five. After transforming the Hu, the Venerable Lord ascended to Heaven. In the fourth year *jiashen*, the Venerable Lord descended once more to the Central States, journeying east to Fuduo, where he convened with the Great Thearch and reviewed the assembly of transcendents. He then traveled to the Western Sea, reaching the state of Sulin, where he was styled as the Great Illuminating Envoy, before ascending to Heaven again. Upon hearing that Perfected Yin Xi had attained the Dao and ascended, King Mu had the Louguan Terrace built and established seven Daoist priests to conduct sacrificial rites. This is recorded in the *Inner Transmission of King Mu* and the *Biography of the Master of Louguan*.

In the first year *bingzi* of King Gong’s reign, he ruled for twelve years.
In the first year *wuzi* of King Yi’s reign, he ruled for twenty-five years.
In the first year *guichou* of King Xiao’s reign, he ruled for fifteen years.
In the first year *wuchen* of King Yi’s reign, he ruled for sixteen years.

The Lord Lao descended with the Three Masters of Primordial Antiquity upon Three Learning Mountain in Mianzhu of Shu, where he transmitted to Li Duozhen the Dao of ascending in flight. Today, this site is called the Governance of Duozhen.

King Li:
In the first year *jiashen*, he ruled for thirty-six years.
In the twenty-first year *jiachen*, the Lord Lao descended upon Louguan, where he transmitted to the Daoist priest Song Lun the Dao of the Middle Effulgence, the *Scripture of Communing with the Perfected*, and the *Six Jia Talismans of Numinous Flight* inscribed on plain silk.

Duke Zhou and Duke Shao’s Regency:
Beginning in *gengshen*, when King Li was exiled to Zhi, the crown prince being young, the two dukes jointly administered state affairs for fourteen years.
Upon King Li’s death, the crown prince was enthroned as King Xuan.

King Xuan:
In the first year *jiaxu*, he ruled for forty-seven years.
In the forty-third year *bingchen*, the Lord Lao descended upon the Wei River, where he informed King Xuan that Jupiter had shifted northward, foretelling the decline of Zhou.
Two years later, King You ascended the throne.
Beside the Wei River lies Boyang Plain, the site of this event, as recorded in the *Treatise on Geography*.

At that time, there was a firewood-gatherer who walked singing, unknown to all. When asked about him, the Lord Lao said: “This is one who revives the people of the state, cultivating the supreme, perfectly true Dao.”
See the Tang *Illustrated Responses Through the Ages*.

King You.

In the first year *gengshen*, he reigned for eleven years.
In the second year *xinyou*, the earth quaked; the Jing, Wei, and Luo Rivers all trembled. The Lord Lao declared that Zhou would perish, and within ten years, the appointed cycle would be fulfilled.
Later, it indeed fell to the Quanrong.
Recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*.

King Ping:
In the first year *xinwei*, he reigned for fifty-one years, relocating eastward to Luoyi.
In the thirty-third year *guimao*, in the twelfth month, the Lord Lao once more emerged from the Pass, enlightening the various states.
He then journeyed to the Western Sea’s Liu and Lin Isles, where he examined and ranked the multitude of immortals.
Upon completing his affairs, he returned to the Central Kingdom.
Recorded in the *Scripture of Western Ascension*.

King Wei:
In the first year *renxu*, he reigned for thirty-three years.

King Zhuang:
In the first year *yiyou*, he reigned for fifteen years.
In the ninth year *guisi*, on the seventh day of the fourth month (the first *mao* day of the lunar cycle), the Buddha Śākyamuni was born.
The Buddhist *Sutra of Auspicious Responses* states: he was born at midnight on the eighth day of the fourth month.
This follows the Zhou calendar.
The *Sutra of Past and Present* further states: he was born on the eighth day of the second month.
This follows the Xia calendar.
At that time, the Lord Lao was six hundred and fourteen years old.
The Buddha’s birth in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou corresponds to the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, falling in the fourth month of the Xia calendar, when the fixed stars were not visible and the night shone bright.
By the eighth year of Emperor Wu of Wei’s Wuding era, one thousand two hundred and thirty-seven years had passed.
Recorded in the *Wei Shu’s Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism* and the *Sui Shu’s Bibliographical Treatise*.
The *Stele of the Toutuo Temple* states: “The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the mirror of night’s radiance.”
Cited in Xiao Tong’s *Wen Xuan*, in Qi Wang Jin’s composition.
The Prince of Shaoling of Liang, in his memorial, wrote: “When the fixed stars vanished, Zhou’s jade was pregnant with omens; at the full moon, her form was round—Han’s dream of the night was stirred.”
Cited in the Tang monk’s *Forest of Gems in the Garden of Dharma*.

King Xi.

In the first year Gengzi, he reigned for five years.

King Hui’s first year Yisi, he reigned for twenty-five years.
King Xiang’s first year Gengwu, he reigned for thirty-three years.
King Xiang’s first year Guimao, he reigned for six years.
King Kuang’s first year Jiyou, he reigned for six years.
In the fourth year Renzi, the Buddha entered *nirvana*.
The Buddhist *Golden Light Sutra* states: “His lifespan was brief, only eighty years.”

King Ding’s first year Yimao, he reigned for twenty-one years.
The king inquired of Lord Lao about the immortals in the world, and Lord Lao replied: “On the Central Peak there is an Ancient Master—it is I.”
Recorded in Zhang Sengjian’s *Wangci Palace* and the *Xunyang Record*.

King Jian’s first year Bingzi, he reigned for fourteen years.
King Ling’s first year Gengyin, he reigned for twenty-seven years.
In the twenty-first year Gengxu, on the twenty-first day of the tenth month, Confucius was born.

King Jing’s first year Dingsi, he reigned for twenty-five years.
King Dao reigned for five months.

King Jing’s first year Renwu, he reigned for forty-three years.
In the seventeenth year Wuxu, Confucius said to Nangong Jingshu: “I have heard that Lao Dan is profoundly versed in antiquity and the present, understands the origins of ritual and music, and illuminates the return of the Dao and virtue—he is my teacher. Now I shall go to him.”
The following year, he and Jingshu together went to Zhou and met Laozi.
According to the *Zhuangzi*: “When Confucius was fifty, he journeyed south to Pei and saw Laozi.” This must refer to this year.
As for his inquiries on ritual and the matter of the archived texts, though recorded in the *Record of Rites*, *The Family Sayings of Confucius*, and the *Records of the Grand Historian*, none specify the year or month, so their sequence remains unknown.
Yet in *The Family Sayings of Confucius*, Zixia asked Confucius: “I have heard that in the *Book of Changes*, the generation of humans and the myriad things each has its odd and even, their qi divided differently. Only those who attain virtue can trace their origins. Heaven is one, earth is two, and man is three; three threes make nine, and nine nines eighty-one. One governs the sun, and the moon’s number is ten, so humans are born after ten months. Eight nines are seventy-two, paired to follow the odd. The odd governs the celestial stems, the stems govern the moon, and the moon governs the horse, so horses are born after twelve months. The rest follow their kind. Birds and fish are born of yin yet belong to yang, so all are born at *mao*. Fish advance in water, birds soar in clouds. Thus at the onset of winter, swallows and sparrows enter the sea and transform into clams and shellfish; scales feed in summer and hibernate in winter. Those that swallow have eight orifices and are born at *mao*, while those that chew have nine orifices and are born from the womb. Four-footed creatures lack feathers and wings; those with horns lack upper teeth. Those born by day resemble their fathers, those born by night their mothers. May I ask if this is so?”
Confucius replied: “Yes, I once heard this from Lao Dan, just as you have said.”
From this, we see that Confucius regarded Lao Dan as profoundly versed in antiquity and the present, so he sought instruction in all things—how could it have been only ritual and the Five Phases or the Five Emperors?
In the forty-first year Jianrenxu, Confucius died.
Recorded in *The Family Sayings of Confucius* and the *Zuo Tradition*.
At that time, Laozi was eight hundred and twenty-four years old.

In the eighth year Geng-shen, Duke Xiao of Qin ascended the throne.
Lord Lao returned eastward, traveling to Red City and Mount Meng, passing again through Fu-duo, where he gathered and assembled the host of immortals.

King Shenjing
The first year Gui-chou, he reigned for six years.

King Nan
Having moved the capital to Western Zhou, the first year Ding-wei, and in the fifty-ninth year Yi-si, he ceded all his cities to Qin, whereupon Western Zhou perished.
In the ninth year Yi-mao, King Zhao of Qin ascended the throne.
Lord Lao, together with Yin Xi and the host of immortals, journeyed west to Mount Nü-ji, Mount Yao-tou, and Mount Tian-zhu, then exited once more through the Hangu Pass, ascending Kunlun and returning to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.
Upon hearing of this, King Zhao ordered cities and towns built at the places Lord Lao had traversed, to mark his sacred traces, thus establishing the lodging station of Lord Lao and the city of Yin Xi.

According to the *Basic Records of Lord Lao* and various historical accounts, Laozi was born in the year Geng-chen of King Wu Ding of Shang at Bo, and soon thereafter ascended to heaven riding a white deer.
One hundred and eight years later, in the year Ding-mao of King Zhou Xin, he descended at Qi Zhou.
Now, reckoning by the extended calendar, the first year of Wu Ding was Ren-shen, and his ninth year was indeed Geng-chen.
The records state: Lord Lao served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury during the time of King Wen of Zhou, and as Archivist Beneath the Pillars during the time of King Wu.
Counting from Wu Ding’s Geng-chen to King Wu’s Gui-you □□□□, nearly one hundred seventy-four years have passed.
The records state: In the fifth month, Ren-wu, of the Gui-chou year of King Zhao of Zhou, Lord Lao was about to leave Zhou, and on the twelfth day of the seventh month, he arrived at the Hangu Pass, where he instructed Yin Xi.
Counting from the first year Xin-mao of King Zhao to his twenty-third year Gui-you, and from Gui-you to Gui-chou, nearly one hundred and one years have passed, totaling nearly two hundred seventy-four years before his westward departure.
The records state: In the year Jia-yin, in the fourth month, Lord Lao ascended into the Great Subtlety at Louguan.
The following year, Yi-mao, he divided his body and was born in Shu.
Two years later, Ding-si, he met Yin Xi at the market of the Green Ram, and together they journeyed to the Western Regions.
By the first year Xin-si of King Mu, he had returned to the Central Lands, passing eastward through the place of the Great Emperor of Fusang, where he gathered and assembled the host of immortals.
From the twenty-third year Gui-chou of King Zhao to the first year Xin-si of King Mu, nearly twenty-eight years have passed, marking the time when Lord Lao had completed his transformation of the Hu and returned to the Central Lands.
The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: In the second year Xin-you of King You of Zhou, the Three Rivers quaked, and Laozi said that Zhou’s mandate was exhausted.
From King Mu’s Xin-si to this Xin-you, nearly two hundred twenty years have passed, totaling nearly five hundred twenty-two years.
In the twenty-third year Gui-mao of King Ping, Lord Lao once more exited the pass, journeyed to the Western Sea, and gathered the host of immortals.
The *Wei Shu: Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism* states: The birth of Śākyamuni occurred in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, corresponding to the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the fourth month, Xin-mao, when the constant stars were not seen.
Now, the first year of King Zhuang was Yi-you, and his ninth year was indeed Gui-si.
From King You’s Xin-you to this Gui-si, ninety-two years have passed, totaling nearly six hundred fourteen years before the Buddha’s birth, and he entered nirvāṇa in the fourth year Ren-zi of King Kuang.
Confucius was born on the twenty-first day of the tenth month, Geng-zi, in the twenty-first year Geng-xu of King Ling of Zhou.
From King Zhuang’s Gui-si to this Geng-xu, nearly one hundred thirty-seven years have passed, totaling nearly seven hundred fifty-one years.
In the fifteenth year Xin-wei of King Jing, Nangong Jing-shu was born, when Confucius was thirty-five years old.
In the eleventh year Ren-chen of King Jing, Duke Ding of Lu ascended the throne, and Jing-shu was first appointed as a grandee but declined, citing his ancestor’s command to serve Confucius.
By the seventh year Wu-xu of Duke Ding, when Confucius was fifty years old, he journeyed south to Pei and met Laozi.
This was the time when Lord Lao had completed his manifestations in all directions and returned once more to the Central Lands.
From King Ling’s Geng-xu to this Wu-xu, nearly forty-nine years have passed, totaling nearly seven hundred ninety-nine years.
The records state: Upon hearing that Laozi had passed by, King Zhao of Qin ordered cities and towns built at the Hangu Pass.
According to King Zhao’s fifty-first year, when he destroyed Zhou, reckoning from the first year Ding-wei of King Nan of Zhou and his ninth year Yi-mao, when King Zhao of Qin ascended the throne, this was the time when Lord Lao was about to ascend Kunlun and return to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.
From King Jing’s Wu-xu to this Yi-mao, nearly one hundred ninety-seven years have passed, totaling nearly nine hundred ninety-six years.
Lord Lao’s responses were boundless, his transformations unfathomable; whether ascending or descending, none could fully comprehend.
Now, examining the records and the extended calendar, reckoning from Wu Ding’s Geng-chen of Shang to Yi-mao of King Nan of Zhou, spanning appearances and concealments over nearly nine hundred ninety-six years—one hundred seventy-four years in Shang and eight hundred twenty-two years in Zhou—this aligns precisely with historical accounts and various classics.
Emperor Ming of Wei praised: "As Archivist Beneath the Pillars of Zhou, he endured nine hundred years."
Wu Yanghao, Academician of the Tang Imperial University, also said: "Lord Lao’s transformations and numinous responses are difficult to fathom; born in the days of Shang, he also served in the time of Zhou, and reckoning from beginning to end, he stood for a thousand years."
These all refer to round numbers.
The *Records of the Grand Historian* mentions "perhaps one hundred sixty years" or "perhaps two hundred years," which is based on the estimations of people in Confucius’ time regarding Laozi’s age, unable to know the truth, hence the frequent use of "perhaps" or "maybe."
Moreover, the *Lie Xian Zhuan* states: "He departed and entered Da Qin."
It also states: "Together with Yin Xi, he journeyed to the Flowing Sands, and none knew where they ultimately went."
Huangfu Mi said: "He went west to the Flowing Sands and composed the *Futu Jing* to transform the Rong customs."

*The Inner Transmission of the Primordial Beginning* states: After Laozi departed through the pass, he journeyed through eighty-one kingdoms and later arrived in Jibin to transform the Hu peoples.

Liu Xiang’s eulogy reads: His virtue harmonized with the Primordial Radiance, his longevity matched the Two Modes.

Though the various traditions differ in their accounts, none fail to extol his long life. Confucians, however, deem the notion of ascending to heaven through longevity as absurd, and thus merely state that none knew his end, implying he never truly died.

Tang scholar Yin Wencao argued: Lao Jun was a great sage who attained the Dao through kalpas of cultivation, and thus could bestow blessings upon the world, harmonizing the hidden and the manifest, undergoing myriad transformations while remaining eternally present. Only Zhuangzi, through the fictional dialogue of Qin Shi’s lament, sought to unsettle those of shallow understanding who cling to life. Yet Emperor Wu of Liang mistakenly took Lao Jun for a corpse-liberated immortal—this was a grave error.

Upon thorough examination of Laozi’s life from beginning to end, no evidence of a release-by-death is found. Zhuang Zhou’s lone assertion is akin to his fables of Jiang and Hong Meng—mere allegories of defiance against history. To take them as fact would be as absurd as accepting Confucius’ encounter with Robber Zhi as a true event.

According to Wang Jia’s *Records of Forgotten Lore*: In the late Zhou, Laozi dwelled on Mount Jingshi, often declaring, “I am ever among men, never absent for even a moment. At times I appear as an ordinary person, at others as a sage—only the vulgar fail to recognize me. Men’s good and evil deeds each bear their karmic consequences, like shadows following form or echoes answering sound. Those who contemplate truth and aspire to goodness may yet encounter me.” This further confirms his undying nature.

The *Scripture of the Dragon’s Hoof* records: In the Hall of Bright Clouds within the Great Luo Heaven, Laozi addressed the Celestial Venerable of the Nine Heavens, saying: “Now, in response to karmic conditions, my realm pervades my entire being, manifesting above in the heavens and below in the myriad phenomena. Through kalpas of transformation, I guide and deliver countless beings. The worthy and the sagely of the Dao descend to become their teachers, or are born into the lower realms, mingling indistinguishably with the worldly, assuming mortal forms yet remaining untainted by the mundane. In harmony with the Dao, I respond to those with affinity, silently aiding and delivering them, never claiming merit. Since my spiritual power is self-so, I descend in every age to meet the needs of the time—how could birth and death ever bind me? You, my disciples, peer at the heavens through a tube—no wonder you find it strange.”

Some claim Laozi studied under Rongcheng or sought the Dao from Chang Cong. This merely reflects the sagely one’s love of worthies and joy in goodness, his humility in seeking knowledge from others. It was also a means to establish the teacher-disciple tradition for posterity—how could there have been any true transmission of teachings?

Older traditions record that his descendants held prominent offices in unbroken succession. This, too, was the sage’s way of avoiding reclusion and eccentricity to startle the world, instead manifesting illusions to harmonize with the dust of the world. Yet fearing that later generations of arrogant and dissolute men might mistake illusion for reality and use the Dao as a pretext for villainy, I have excised such accounts.

As for the theory of the Sixteen Transformations, its details are obscure and offer no enlightenment.

In the first year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the yimao year (246 BCE), he reigned for thirty-six years, and in the gengchen year (221 BCE), he first unified the realm as emperor.

In the seventeenth year of Kaiyuan (729 CE), Lao Jun descended upon Xinxing Temple in Shuzhou, his hidden radiance manifesting within a pillar of the Buddha hall, as vivid as if carved or painted—scrubbing and washing only made it clearer. Local civil and military officials, along with Daoists, monks, laypeople, and nuns, jointly memorialized the event, stating: "Appearing upon the hall’s pillar, its traces evoke the era of the historian’s craft. Dwelling within the Buddha’s shrine, it recalls the distant days of the *Huahu* transformation." Recorded in the memorial of Prefectural Governor of Yizhou, Zhang Jingzhong.

In the twenty-ninth year of Kaiyuan (741 CE), Lao Jun descended outside the Danfeng Gate, speaking to Tian Tongxiu: "Long ago, I entered the Flowing Sands and concealed a golden numinous talisman in Yin Xi’s former residence.

*Annals of the Primordial Sage, Scroll the First* concludes.

---
*Annals of the Primordial Sage, Scroll the Second*
Compiled by Gao Shi, Master of Observing the Return and Grand Daoist of the Song, Xie Shouyu.

The Most High Lord Lao is the ancestral founder of the Great Dao and the root origin of the Three Powers. Before the Supreme Ultimate, there was only vast emptiness—until the source of the Dao first stirred. The Dark Mother coalesced in primordial chaos, and from the murky depths emerged the first glimmer of embryonic radiance. Within it lay true essence, born of itself, which became spirit and illumination. By force of naming, it was called the Void Sovereign. Concealed, it governed the mysterious transformations; through the Dao’s movement, it ruled the world.

From the One Qi, the Three Qi emerged—these being the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Origin. When the Three Qi blended, their subtle vapors gradually took form, giving rise to the beginnings of the ten thousand phenomena. None knew what came before, so it was forcibly named *Yuan* ("Origin"); none knew its beginning, so it was forcibly named *Shi* ("Commencement")—hence the title *Yuanshi Tianzun* ("Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning"). As the Three Qi generated one another, the Nine Qi merged, giving birth to the various heavens and completing the worlds. None knew its greatness, so it was forcibly named *Tai* ("Supreme"); none knew its height, so it was forcibly named *Shang* ("Most High"). It stood foremost beyond the Ultimate, and gazing upward, it was called *Lao* ("Ancient"); governing without self, it was called *Jun* ("Lord")—thus was formed the title *Yuanshang Santian Xuanyuan Shi Sanqi Taishang Laojun* ("Most High Lord Lao of the Three Heavens of Primordial Origin, the Three Qi, and the Mysterious Beginning").

Initially, from the One Qi arose the Three Qi, which constitute the Three Heavens. The Three Qi combined to generate the Nine Qi, which constitute the Nine Heavens. From the Great Brahma Heaven descended the Three Pure Realms: the Heaven of Qingwei, the Heaven of Yuyu, and the Heaven of Dachi. Below the Three Heavens arose the nine great Brahma Heavens: Yudan Heaven, Shanshan Heaven, Xuyan Heaven, Douyan Heaven, Bujiaole Heaven, Dongyuan Heaven, Fanfu Heaven, Qingming Heaven, and Wuxiang Heaven. Each of the Nine Heavens further generated three heavens below, totaling thirty-six heavens. All lesser Brahma Heavens beyond these are subordinate to these great Brahma Heavens. The Nine Qi are the Fused Qi, the Blazing Qi, the Evolving Qi, the Vast Qi, the Radiant Qi, the Dao Qi, the Chaotic Qi, the Penetrating Qi, and the Boundless Qi.

Next are the Four Heavens of Seed-Peoples: the Heaven of Supreme Ultimate Peace and Nurturance, the Heaven of Dragon Transformation and Brahma Salvation, the Heaven of Jade Eminence and Ascendant Victory, and the Heaven of Great Emptiness and Constant Fusion. These are the Heavens of Seed-Peoples, also called the Seed-Humans, for at the beginning of each kalpa, they descend to become the progenitors of humanity. The Buddhists refer to them as the Four Dhyāna Heavens. Above, these heavens draw from the Three Thousand Three Hundred Million *xi* of the Three Pure Realms of the Great Clarity; below, they generate the Five Thousand Five Hundred Fifty-Five Million *xi* of the Eight Brahma Heavens. Each *xi* measures three thousand *li*. These heavens lie beyond the Three Realms, transcending the reckonings of yin and yang, and thus are not bound by limits of years or lifespans, nor can they be destroyed by the calamities of water, fire, or wind.

Next are the Three Realms: the Realm of Desire with its six heavens, the Realm of Form with its eighteen heavens, and the Formless Realm with its four heavens. Then come the Eight Brahma Heavens: Beginning Azure Heaven, Azure Origin Heaven, Beginning Cinnabar Heaven, Supreme Cinnabar Heaven, Beginning Plain Heaven, Supreme Plain Heaven, Beginning Mysterious Heaven, and Supreme Mysterious Heaven. Next is the human world, divided into eight directions: the Pure and Tranquil World of the North, the Everlasting Peace World of the Northeast, the Welcoming Virtue World of the East, the Employing Worthies World of the Southeast, the Abandoning Worthies World of the South, the Benevolent and Tranquil World of the Southwest, the Pure Conduct World of the West, and the Extending Worthies World of the Northwest. Below these lie the Nine Earths, which solidify into mountains and merge into seas and marshes.

The First Earth is the Moist and Lustrous Earth; the Second, the Hard and Lustrous Earth; the Third, the Unctuous and Lustrous Earth; the Fourth, the Moist Earth; the Fifth, the Golden Grain Earth; the Sixth, the Diamond and Iron Earth; the Seventh, the Water-Restrained Earth; the Eighth, the Great Wind Earth; and the Ninth, the Penetrating Spring and Colorless Net Earth. Each layer consists of one stratum of soil, one of water, and one of wind, descending from above.

The essence of yang becomes the sun; the essence of yin becomes the moon. The essences of the sun, moon, and Five Phases coalesce into the stars. When the Two Qi interact, the myriad beings of plants and animals mutually generate and transform. As the *Scripture on Establishing the Kalpas* states: "Within the formless and nameless, the turbid and chaotic, I opened the Mysterious Yellow of the Dao, divided the numinous, and dispersed the qi. From the Great Brahma Heaven descended the Three Realms; next arose the Nine Heavens. The Nine Emperors were established as the mysterious laws of the Three Treasures; the twenty-seven heavens became the cultivated realms of the boundaries. The thirty-six departments formed the mysterious roots of the Three Realms, and below, they became the domains of the thirty-six heavens. Next came the thirty-two heavens and thirty-two emperors, who subtly governed the transformations. Below, they divided into the Three Realms, laterally connecting to the revolving mechanism of the twenty-eight constellations. The Five Stars wove their paths to illuminate the five directions. The pure qi ascended; the heavy and turbid congealed below. Below arose the Nine Earths; in the middle arose the Nine Humans. Heaven, earth, and all beings were thus complete.

Thus, the harmonious and upright qi of yang gave birth to the lofty perfected sages; the gentle and tranquil qi of softness gave birth to the Primordial Ladies, sagely consorts, female immortals, and jade maidens; the fierce and valiant qi gave birth to the Heavenly Soldiers, the Divine Generals, and the martial officers; the qi of yin, yang, and the Five Phases gave birth to men and women; and the chaotic and errant qi gave birth to birds and beasts. All derive from the One Non-Being, yet their myriad forms differ according to their generation.

At the end of a great kalpa, from the Nine Earths up to the Formless Realm, the Three Calamities arise, and the ten thousand phenomena dissolve. Above the Heavens of Seed-Peoples, the calamities do not reach. The Primordial Qi recombines, returning to chaos. After the kalpa reopens, the heavenly beings are once more commanded to descend as human seed, becoming rulers and ministers. They propagate the great Dao and establish the laws, disseminating transformations in accordance with the times. Countless vast kalpas have passed, and all have proceeded thus.

As the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity* states: The heavens are round with twelve guiding principles; the earth is square with twelve governing mechanisms. The heavenly principles revolve through three hundred sixty degrees, forming the yang comet; the earthly mechanisms advance through three thousand six hundred degrees, forming the yin eclipse. The heavenly principles complete one revolution in three hundred thirty days; the earthly mechanisms advance one degree in three thousand three hundred days. Nine thousand nine hundred degrees mark the convergence of heaven and earth’s qi, known as the Great Yang Nine and the Great Hundred Six—also called the Great Kalpa and the Great Cycle. Multiplying these numbers, a minor yang comet occurs roughly once every three hundred thirty years, which constitutes the Lesser Yang Nine Calamity.

One hundred eighty-nine thousand years mark the completion of the heavenly principles’ revolution, thirty-three thousand cycles of the earthly mechanisms’ advancement, and the convergence of three thousand three hundred degrees of the Great Cycle. As heaven moves and earth remains still, yang is swift while yin is slow—hence the distinction between comets and eclipses. At this time, heavenly qi is exhausted in the Great Yin, and earthly qi reaches its peak in the Great Yang. When yang is at its extreme, comets appear; when yin is at its extreme, stagnation arises. At yang’s extremity, its essence transforms into water; at yin’s extremity, its essence transforms into fire. First, the world is consumed by great fire, then submerged by great floods—rising to the space beneath the Nine Heavens, descending to the depths within the Nine Earths—until gold and jade dissolve, and not even the smallest trace remains. Only then do the primordial qi recombine, known as the Primal Chaos. When the Primal Chaos divides again, the Three Heavens’ sages and the Four Heavens’ seed-people descend to teach and transform the world, just as at the beginning of this kalpa, when the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors succeeded one another in governance. Such transformations are collectively called the Cycles of Convergence and Separation.

The Most Venerable Lord has endured these cycles of separation and convergence through countless kalpas, as the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: *"Movement brings the burden of kalpas; I reflect on the toil and hardship."* This is what it means.

The *Comprehensive Records of Customs* states: *"Ten thousand days make a wan, ten wan make a yi, ten yi make a zhao, ten zhao make a jing, ten jing make a gai, and ten gai make a zai."* The term *zai* signifies that the earth can no longer bear it.

According to the *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirits*: When the Great Cycle nears its end and the count concludes on the year of *jiashen*, the Three Officials wield their brushes to assess and distinguish the seed-people, calculating merits and transgressions to separate the good from the evil. From the era of Red Clarity to the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, those who received initiation according to the *Primordial Yang Jade Treasury* numbered two hundred forty thousand. From the era of Kaihuang to the year of *jiashen*, as the heavens select the worthy, the offices of immortals lie vacant, and the celestial bureaucracy remains unfilled. According to the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*, three generations must pass before those of sincere heart, who accumulate goodness and establish merit, are recommended by the Three Realms and protected by the Five Emperors—those whose names are recorded in the heavens—are chosen, ten thousand in number, to fill these roles. An additional one hundred twenty thousand are to be selected as reserve officials. The Three Officials correspond in harmony, inscribing the names of the seed-people in reverse order, for they are destined to be born in the Four Heavens as the people of the next kalpa.

Furthermore, the Nine Dark Prisons receive the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate from the Azure Palace of the Eastern Marchmount, commanding the liberation of the male and female souls of the dead in the Nine Dark Prisons—those whose past lives bore good names, whose merits and virtues are complete, and who are destined to receive deliverance. Thirty-two thousand such souls are chosen to replenish the people of the Great Prosperity after the purgation of *jiashen*. All kalpas follow this pattern, with destinies scrutinized by the Most Venerable Lord.

The form of heaven and earth resembles that of a chicken’s egg, encircled by primordial darkness like the halo around the sun. Thus, there are five hundred five million five hundred fifty-five myriad layers of heaven and earth, each containing its own celestial patterns and terrestrial principles, circulating yin and yang and the Five Phases, arraying gods and spirits, generating the myriad things, wielding the handle of life and completion, and anchoring the origin of creation and transformation. Therefore, in the heavens, he is the most revered among all sages; in the world, he is the master of all teachings. He is called Laozi, the embodiment of the Dao. His manifestations are not singular, and his titles are boundless—sometimes thirty-six, sometimes seventy-two. He may be called the Supreme August Emperor of the Nine Heavens, the Sovereign of the Cavern-Realm and Primordial Unity, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Great Emperor of Longevity, the Marvelous Black August Lord of Supreme Peace and Perfect Authenticity, the Emperor of the Nine Mysteries, the Dharma King of the Great Thousand, the Elder of the Nine Numinous, the Left Mystic Perfected of the Supreme Clarity, the Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns’ Wondrous Scriptures of the Golden Palace, the Most High Great Dharma King, the Mystic Unity of True Stillness and Light, the Latter Sage of the Golden Palace, the Lord of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital, the Nine-Black Elder, the Supreme Elder, the Lord of the Twelve Hundred Offices, the Supreme Scenery Lord of Supreme Peace, the Father of Non-Action, or the Mother of the Myriad Things.

At the time of his descent into the world, the divine beings of the ten directions reverently bear wisdom, the Most Honored, the Teacher of Emperors, the Great Man, the Venerable Immortal, the Father of Heaven and Humankind, the Supreme Person of Non-Action, the Great Compassionate One, the Benevolent, and the Master of the True Origin. The heavenly and earthly beings praise him with ten titles: the Lord of Non-Action, the Supreme Mystic Elder, the Most Venerable Lord Lao, the Most High Laozi, the Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Ancient Great Master, the Emperor of the Golden Palace, the Most High Supreme August, and the Great Perfected of Emptiness and Non-Being. He is also known by titles such as the Perfect and Boundless Great Dao, the Natural and Primordial Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Lord of the Dao, the Supreme Heavenly Perfected, the Heavenly Elder, the Heavenly Master, the Yellow Elder, the Mystic Ancestor, the Teacher of the World, the Divine Person, the Perfected, the Immortal, the Utmost Person, the Great Person, the Daoist, and the Sage. The titles from the Heavenly Perfected downward each consist of two characters.

The Most Venerable Lord, the Cavern-Realm’s Ultimate Sage, has no fixed form. When he dissolves, he becomes darkness; when he rests, he becomes human. At times, he coalesces into his true form within the Great Void, his body boundless, his features perfectly complete, with nothing above to grasp and nothing below to tread upon. At other times, he resides upon the Cloud Blossom, his body golden, attended by ten thousand perfected beings and revered by a hundred spirits. Or he sits within a lotus, wearing a crown adorned with the Seven Luminaries, draped in a nine-colored radiant robe, his neck bearing a halo that illuminates heaven and earth. Or he dwells in a jeweled hall and golden palace, surrounded by pearl and jade curtains, as ten thousand emperors pay homage and divine soldiers guard his carriage. Sometimes his form is golden and jade-like, clad in yellow garments and embroidered robes; at others, he wears plain robes and a dark cap, riding a white horse with a red mane. At times, he governs the Ten Heavens, sealing and overseeing the myriad people, residing in the Supreme Subtlety, the Curved Array, or the Purple Chamber as the Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign. In spring, he transforms into the Supreme Scenery Lord, nine thousand *zhang* tall, wearing a crown of the Seven Treasures’ radiant flowers, dressed in robes of dark yellow and black, with a flying skirt of blue brocade, holding a tiger tally, and seated upon a seven-colored cloud.

In summer, he transforms into the Venerable Elder, wearing a crown of nine dragons, clad in robes of yellow patterns and a skirt of yellow feathers, holding a golden tablet, standing upon purple clouds. In autumn, he becomes a youth, dressed in five-colored garments, sometimes riding a lion, sometimes seated upon blue clouds. In winter, he manifests as a radiance of dark, mysterious, and azure hues, their luminous chaos intertwining—this is the return to the Black of the Golden Palace, where he further refines the essence of soaring mystery and dawn’s communion.

At times, he incarnates as the Great Emperor of the Dark Heavens. The scriptures say that in eighty-two transformations he becomes True Martial. Thus, the Invocation of the Protector Sage Perfected Lord declares: *"We reverently invoke the Great Sage of the Dark Heavens, the numinous spirit of the northern *ren* and *gui*, the True Honored One of the Golden Palace who manifests in response, the Supreme General known as True Martial."* His divine potency is self-sufficient; he appears as he is perceived. He can be white or black, square or round, bent or extended, long or short, old or young, one or ten thousand. His form shifts and reverses without constancy.

At times, he is the Twelve Hundred Elders, manifesting across the heavens. At others, he is the One Hundred Eighty Dao Lords, guiding the mortal world, dispersing his numinous radiance in fleeting, boundless presence—yet the essence of his True One remains serene and eternally quiescent, ever abiding in the Grand Clarity and the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

Once, in the first year of *Shanghe*—the year *gengyin* of the celestial reckoning, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the *jiazi* day—Lord Lao was born within the Jade Country of the Northern *Yudan* realm, at the Valley of Li between the Heavenly Mirror Mountain. His mother, the Mysterious Numinous Mother of the Nine Mysteries’ Chamber, first conceived him in a dream where dark clouds, sun, and moon entwined her form, and the lightning of the Six Qi stirred her spirit, thus quickening with child. On the day of his birth, three suns rose together, and so he took the valley as his clan name and the radiant light as his given name. He was also called *Hong*, styled *Ziguang*; another name was *Xuanshui*, styled *Shanyuan*.

*Shanghe* is but one of the celestial eras, akin to *Chiming*, *Zhuling*, *Qinghan*, *Tianhan*, *Kaihuang*, and *Shanghuang*. Yet worldly scholars, knowing only that the *jiazi* cycle was devised by *Danao* and that reign titles began with Emperor Wu of Han, dismiss such celestial eras as fabrications. Little do they realize that the heavens have recorded years since countless kalpas past, though mortals remain unaware.

From *Guiguzi* to *Beiguozi*, from Celestial Master Zhang to *Ge Xian’gong*, all have drawn upon celestial era names to align with mortal ages. Otherwise, how could these immortals, versed in ancient and modern lore, delving into the profound and subtle, be ignorant that reign titles did not exist before Qin and Han? From the dawn of creation, when laws and institutions were established, to the rise and fall of dynasties, all is predestined by heaven, which dispatches celestial perfected beings to transmit teachings to the mortal world—not by mortal hands could such be devised beforehand. Let scholars ponder this.

Thereupon, he gathered his hun souls and refined his po spirits, guarded the womb’s treasured spirit, recorded his essence and stabilized his blood, solidified his fluids and strengthened his sinews. He swallowed light and drank mist, chewed the roots of flight, his inner virtue perfectly full, his external burdens far severed. His forms multiplied into millions, his transformations boundless.

The Supreme Perfected Lord of the Purple Tenuity and the Jade Clarity Heavenly Emperor dispatched an eight-scene jade chariot to welcome him, ascending to the Palace of Supreme Clarity. There, he was bestowed the *Ruigang* Elixir and the Jade Phoenix Seal, the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance, the talismans of the Divine Tiger and the feathers of flight, a crimson brocade dragon skirt, a blue mantle with tiger belt, and the Crown of Round Countenance. He received the scriptures and was named the Posterior Sage Emperor Lord of the Golden Palace.

In the first year of *Longhan*, Lord Lao divided his body in the Central Land of Great Blessing, revealing the True Writ of Red Script to transform its people, who all attained longevity. Later, in the Southern Culmen’s *Chiming* Land, he issued the Fire-Refined True Writ, thus naming it the Court of Cavernous Yang, where a Pool of Flowing Fire exists. Those who refined their forms therein became golden in hue. Above, he established the Palace of Southern Prosperity; below, the Lodge of Vermilion Mound, to govern generation and completion.

Across the five kalpas of *Longhan*, *Chiming*, *Shanghuang*, *Yankang*, and *Kaihuang*, Lord Lao cyclically wielded the qi of *Beginning Green*, *Cinnabar Radiance*, *Central Numinosity*, *Pristine Florescence*, and *Mysterious Yang*, revolving them into the Jade Calendar. Since *Longhan*, through boundless kalpas, within the vastness of primordial chaos where no light shone, records could not be traced. Only with the *Chiming* Unfolding Chart did scriptures become discernible.

The True Writ is the essence of the Five Directions’ true qi, congealed into script, its eight corners trailing rays. It may take the form of cloud-seal characters or assume the shapes of flight and movement—these are the talismanic writs of today, the covenants of celestial perfected beings. The above is found interspersed within the Three Caverns’ true scriptures.

Moreover, in the Eastern Culmen’s *Biluo* Heaven, within the *Fuli* Land, he inscribed the True Writ upon the Azure Forest, forming characters of purple hue. The wind through its trees produced music, and birds that ate its leaves grew patterned plumage. Those who obtained its feathers could fly. Its people lived long, at peace and without striving.

In the Western Culmen’s *Weiluo* World, within the *Xinayu* Land, he issued the True Writ upon the *Fuluo* Peaks to deliver its people. Jade pools arose spontaneously, golden essence flowed and shimmered; those who ladled its waters grew golden radiance, becoming equal to heaven.

In the Northern Land of *Yudan*, he inscribed the True Writ within the Cavernous Numinosity Abbey to deliver its multitudes. Below lay the Cold Pool’s numinous springs, naturally flowing and abundant; those who drank thereof knew no end.

Within these five lands, all received Lord Lao’s teachings of the Numinous Treasure, attaining longevity. Thus, he commanded the Five Elder Thearchs to guard the Five Directions, propagating the Dao and extending teachings to harmonize and pacify all beings.

The *History of the Sui Dynasty: Treatise on Classics and Books* states: *"The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was born before the Great Nonbeing, inheriting the qi of spontaneity. Profound and distant, none know his limits. Though heaven and earth collapse and kalpas end, the body of the Celestial Worthy remains eternally indestructible."*

Each time heaven and earth first unfold, whether upon the Jade Capital above or in the wilds of Qiongsang, he imparts the secret Dao, calling it "Opening the Kalpa to Deliver Humankind." Yet this opening of the kalpa has occurred not once but many times, hence the era names: Yankang, Chiming, Longhan, and Kaihuang. The scriptures he expounds are likewise endowed with the qi of Primordial Unity, existing spontaneously and not by fabrication, just as the Celestial Worthy abides eternally undiminished. While heaven and earth remain unbroken, these texts lie concealed and untransmitted; when the kalpic cycle unfolds, their words appear of themselves. He then commands the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transform and elucidate the celestial sounds, and from the Heavenly Perfected down to the various immortals, they transmit them in turn through successive ranks. Only when the immortals receive them do they begin to bestow them upon the world. In their great purport, these teachings ultimately return to benevolence, love, and purity; through accumulation and cultivation, one gradually attains longevity, naturally undergoing spiritual transformation, ascending to immortality in broad daylight, and merging one’s body with the Dao.

The *Daode Jing* of Zhang Shangying of the Song states: "The kalpic cycles stretch vast and boundless, the Great and Lesser [Dao] obstructed and blocked; heterodox flourishing loses the Primordial, scattering and manifesting among the multitudes. Through their nine orifices, emotions and perceptions arise. As emotions flow and perceptions obscure, one becomes entangled and inverted. From this flow arises attachment, and from obscuration arises aversion. Aversion and attachment assail one another, rising and falling in succession; abandoning clarity for darkness, the accumulation of darkness forms yin. Yin congeals into obscurity, and entering obscurity, one becomes a ghost. When the spirit is upright, one takes human form; when deviant, one enters other destinies—devouring, oppressing, their natures unable to attain stillness, their lives unable to endure. Dark flourishing and gloomy miasma offend the celestial extremes. The Three Clarities’ transforming lords, the Three Thearchs and Celestial Lords, observing from above, a single thought arouses compassion. Spontaneous wondrous flourishing weaves into patterns; a numinous wind stirs and plays, forming sounds of its own. Utmost compassion delivers from distress; utmost benevolence cherishes life; utmost rectitude crushes the heterodox; utmost clarity shatters darkness. Above, celestial offices are arrayed; below, mountain grottoes are established. The host of perfected beings receive their duties; the ranked immortals divide their governance. Once the true mechanism is revealed, the jade script emerges. Fire refines the Cavernous Yang; brushes inscribe the Azure Void. Jade seals and golden tablets, talismans and oral incantations are taught to the immortal throng, wielding authority to restrain demonic hordes, refining and delivering souls and spirits, commanding the myriad numina.

The Supreme Dao of the Most High has three [methods]; the Dao of the Upper Perfected has seven; the Dao of the Middle Perfected has six; the Dao of the Lower Perfected has four. What the Golden Mouth has spoken, what the Three Masters have transmitted—precious jade caskets and sacred bamboo tubes—are secretly stored on Mount Tiantai. Those that have fallen among humankind, a single tablet from the Great Granary, are collected by cultivators of the true into the Three Caverns. The utterly non-existent Upper Perfected are called the Cavern of the True. The profound, subtle, and wondrous are called the Cavern of the Mysterious. The numinous, marvelous, hidden, and manifest are called the Cavern of the Numinous. That which is true beyond the true dissolves into quiescence without pattern. That which is primordial beyond the primordial abides in wondrous solitude. That which is numinous beyond the numinous is revered and boundless. Such is the purport of the true texts of the Three Caverns.

Lord Lao further transformed his body, styling himself the Celestial Worthy of Tranquil Aging. He propagated his teachings across the Five Directions, then on the Ninefold Mystic Terrace of Mount Donghua expounded the Dao to the King of the Eastern Ultimate and Primordial Elder. The king’s consort, princes, and ministers—over five thousand in all—together cultivated this Dao and all attained earthly immortality. Thereupon, they established the Abbey of Immortal Practice, the Sevenfold Upright and Twofold Mystic Halls, where aspiring immortals resided. Within two hundred years, over three thousand in the land ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and the king ascended to become the Lord of the Wondrous Brahmā Heaven.

According to the *Inner Writ of the Azure Lad*: "The Land of the Primordial Elder lies beyond the Eastern Sea; it is also called the Land of Pure Harmony, where the Lord of the Wondrous Brahmā Heaven resides. Later, due to excessive indulgence in pleasure, he was demoted to the human realm as the king of Jibin, whom Laozi transformed into the Buddha." During the era of the Heavenly Thearch, Lord Lao was known as the Great Master of the Mystic Center, also called the Celestial Master of Penetrating the Mysterious. He revealed the *Twelve Books of the Cavern of the True*, teaching the Great Dao of the Non-Ultimate to the human realm. During the era of the Earthly Thearch, he was known as the Ancient Great Master, revealing the *Twelve Books of the Cavern of the Mysterious* and transforming humankind with the Dao of the Supreme and Perfectly True. During the era of the Human Thearch, he was known as Master Pangu, revealing the *Twelve Books of the Cavern of the Numinous* and transforming humankind with the Dao of Grand Peace and Non-Action.

During the time of Fuxi, he descended to the fields, styling himself Yuhua Zi, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Heavenly Thearch* and the *River Chart* of the Eight Trigrams, teaching humankind the Dao of aligning with one’s nature. During the time of Zhu Rong, he descended to Mount Heng, styling himself Guangshou Zi, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Human Thearch* and teaching the Dao of pacifying the spirit, enabling the molding of clay into vessels to transform raw and cooked. During the time of Shennong, he descended to Jiyin, styling himself Dacheng Zi, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Earthly Thearch* and teaching the Dao of cherishing life, enabling the sowing of grains and fruits to replace cooking and killing, and the harmonizing of medicinal recipes to cure illness and nurture one’s nature. These events are briefly recorded in the Tang annals.

During the time of the Yellow Thearch, he descended to Mount Kongtong, styling himself Guangcheng Zi. In the twenty-ninth year of his reign, the Yellow Thearch, troubled that the world was not well-governed, went to see Guangcheng Zi and asked: "I have heard that you have attained the Ultimate Dao. I wish to draw upon the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people, and to observe yin and yang to fulfill the needs of all living beings. How may this be done?" Guangcheng Zi replied: "What you inquire about is the substance of things; what you desire to manage is the destruction of things. Since you began governing the world, the clouds and rain no longer gather before falling, the grasses and trees no longer wait to yellow before falling, and the light of the sun and moon has grown dim. As for those glib-tongued flatterers of yours, how could they be worthy of speaking of the Ultimate Dao?"

The Yellow Thearch withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and advanced on his knees with the wind at his back. Bowing twice, he prostrated himself and asked: "I have heard that you, Master, have attained the Ultimate Dao. I venture to ask: how may one govern the body so as to attain longevity?" Guangcheng Zi rose with a frown and said: "Excellent question! Come, and I shall tell you."

The essence of the Ultimate Dao is profound and obscure, its apex dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will naturally align. Be pure, be still; do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence. Reduce thought, curb desire, and you may attain long life. Let the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the heart know nothing—then the spirit will guard the body, and the body will endure. Guard your inner self, close off the outer; excessive knowledge leads to ruin.

I have guided you to the source of supreme yang, the radiance of great clarity. I have led you through the gate of profound obscurity, the source of supreme yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang their treasuries. Guard your body with care, and all things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony. Thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.

The Yellow Thearch bowed twice and prostrated himself, saying: "Master, you speak as heaven itself."

Guangcheng Zi then said to the Yellow Thearch: "Come, I shall tell you more. Those things are infinite, yet the people all deem them finite. Those things are unfathomable, yet all take them as limits. Those who attain my Dao become emperors above and kings below. Those who lose my Dao see light above yet become earth below. Now, all the myriad beings are born from the earth and return to the earth. Therefore, I shall depart from you, entering the gate of the infinite to wander the boundless wilds. I share the light of the sun and moon, and endure with heaven and earth."

Thereupon, he bestowed upon the Thearch the *Scripture of the Hidden Talisman*. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the Old Lord expounded the scriptures, which the world called the *Three Tombs*—long lost to transmission. The scriptures taught across generations were often concealed in jade chambers and jasper terraces, or secreted in the Dragon Palace’s sea vaults, guarded by divine immortals, unknown to the world. What has been transmitted is but a single filament from Mount Tai.

Later, the Queen Mother of the West was commanded to present the Thearch with the jade image of the Primordial Celestial Worthy. The Thearch placed it in a lofty observatory, reverently enshrining it, where it was ever veiled by colored clouds—hence the name "Daoist abbey." The term "Daoist abbey" began here.

According to the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era*, as cited in the Daoist scriptures: In ancient times, the Dao was dark and quiescent, its essence formless and inactive. When it wished to initiate mysterious workings and transform the myriad things, it first generated the Lord of the East through the radiance of the Eastern Flower’s perfect yang. Born upon the Azure Sea in the wastes of the Blue Spirit, he presided over the warmth of yang and governed the eastern realm, known as the Lord of the East. Then, through the mystery of the Western Flower’s perfect yin, it generated the Queen Mother, who oversaw the origin of life, her divine profundity concealed in the vastness. She distilled the pure essence of the Great Dao, condensing its radiance into form, and together with the Lord of the East, they governed the two qi, nurturing heaven and earth, shaping the myriad things. Embodying the root of soft compliance, she was the primal yin, her position matched to the west, mothering all beings—hence the name Queen Mother of the West. In heaven above, on earth below, across the three realms and ten directions, all women who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao are subject to her.

The Lord of the East wears the Triple-Support Crown and robes of nine-colored cloud and mist. He is also called the Jade Sovereign Lord, dwelling in the Cloud Chamber, his canopy of purple cloud, his city of blue cloud. Immortal youths stand in attendance, jade maidens scatter incense, and countless divine officials and immortals serve in their offices. Thus, all men who attain the Dao have their names recorded under his registry. He visits the Nine-Spirit Metal Mother twice yearly, touring her palace to jointly assess and rank the merits of male and female immortals, promoting or demoting them by their deeds. Through the cycles of heaven and earth, the alternation of yin and yang, the rise and fall of time, the calamities of yang-nine and yin-six, the exaltation of the good and demotion of the wicked—all proceed by their decree. They compile the registers and submit them to the Primordial Celestial Worthy, who transmits them through the Jade Dawn to the Old Lord, who in turn bestowed the Dao upon the Yellow Thearch. Thus, the Metal Mother was commanded to reveal the image of the Primordial Celestial Worthy.

The Old Lord further commanded the Thearch to ascend Mount Wangwu, open the stone coffer, and retrieve the jade writ, obtaining the Way of the Nine Cauldrons’ divine elixir and the furnace fire of flying snow. The Thearch then cast the cauldrons at Mount Jing, refined the elixir, and consumed it. Clouds and dragons came to welcome him, and he ascended on a dragon. Seventy-two of his ministers and attendants likewise ascended with him. The lesser officials, unable to follow, grasped the dragon’s whiskers and clung to the Thearch’s bow and cauldron, falling as they wailed. The world called this the "Crow-Caw Bow." The people, unable to follow, took his relics to Mount Ba and built a tomb to enshrine them, naming it Mount Ba. They also buried his robes and cap at Mount Qiao, calling it the Yellow Thearch’s Mausoleum. Where the cauldron fell was named Cauldron Lake. Today, atop Mount Xiandu in Jinyun County of Chuzhou, there is a Cauldron Lake, inaccessible by path, where golden lotuses grow. Their leaves often drift down to the Twin Streams, hence the name Jinhua County. Anciently, the Thearch’s clan was called Jinyun, so the county was named thus—truly not in vain.

Initially, the Old Lord descended to the world to establish teachings, revealing the secrets of cultivation and the standards of master-disciple transmission. In the first year of the Upper Sovereign’s reign, on the seventh day of the seventh month, he journeyed to the Western River. There, he beheld the Primordial Celestial Worthy riding an Eight-Scenery Jade Chariot, drawn by nine-colored dark dragons, with three pure flying clouds, leading a procession of immortals, floating through the void to meet him above the Western River. The Celestial Worthy exhaled the Jade Talisman of the Cavernous Mystery’s Inner Vision, bestowing it upon the Old Lord. The Old Lord bowed deeply, received the teaching, and ingested the talisman. Within his body, the eight luminous spirits of the three divisions appeared, and twenty-four diagrams of golden script and jade characters shone forth in the void, illuminating all without limit, their patterns naturally unfolding. He commanded the immortal in charge of the diagrams to transcribe them—golden script in purple characters, cinnabar slips and jade tablets—thus establishing them. All the true texts bestowed by the Supreme Perfected Lady of the Nine Lights of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Flowers, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the immortals of the Five Peaks, and the Pure Void Perfected Ones—all originated from the Old Lord.

The diagrams are divided into three ranks: upper, middle, and lower.

All twenty-four diagrams are arts of cultivating the body and attaining longevity, all perfected through the transformations of the Grotto Mystery and Primordial Beginning.

The Old Lord further oversaw the *Jade Dawn Divine Tiger Talisman Diagram* and the *Wisdom Plain Sutra*. All talismanic jade chapters of the *Highest Clarity Great Grotto True Scripture* for summoning numinous spirits and subduing demons were under his stewardship. These scriptures were all formed from the naturally coalescing pneumas of soaring mystery, their Dao lofty and wondrous, the most revered among all scriptures, governing the myriad spirits, guiding and ruling the host of immortals. They were concealed in the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, inscribed on golden slips to compile the numinous texts, and carved on cinnabar-inscribed jade to clarify their passages. Some were stored within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Capital’s Jeweled Palace, guarded by great beasts, and protected by seven thousand poisonous dragons, divine tigers, and numinous spirits stationed at the Jade Tower. Three thousand Golden Dawn Jade Lads and Plain Numinous Jade Maidens each attended and safeguarded the sacred texts. The assembled Perfected Ones held banquets in ritual observance, and the ten thousand sages paid homage in audience.

The Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord often said to the Old Lord: “At the turning of the great kalpa, the teaching is bestowed upon the most worthy. If none are found, it remains untransmitted for kalpas. Later students seeking immortality, not knowing the origin of the Dao, vainly exhaust their thoughts in preservation, wearing out body and spirit. To seek the root, one must return to the source; losing the source while seeking life, none attain wholeness. The Jade Texts of the Highest Sovereign are transmitted only to those chosen; their methods are treasures, profoundly secret, beyond words. One must follow the luminous statutes and receive them in reverence.”

In the first year of the Middle Sovereign’s reign, on the first day of the third month of the renxu year, the Old Lord, in the Jeweled Chamber of the Jade Heaven, examined and collated the original sources, compiling the numinous chapters into three hundred volumes of sacred scriptures, seven thousand chapters of talismanic diagrams, and nine thousand jade instructions. He bestowed these upon the Azure Lad Great Lord of the Eastern Sea’s Fangzhu Palace, commanding their transmission to later students whose jade names matched the Perfected.

After receiving the sacred scriptures, the Great Lord ascended to the rank of High Minister. Three thousand Golden Flower Jade Maidens and Purple Dawn Jade Lads all attended and guarded him. Wielding the banner of the numinous talisman, he commanded demonic spirits, roamed the Purple Void’s halls, wandered the Azure Flower’s chambers, extinguished the Six Heavens at the end of the kalpa, and eradicated the myriad spirits in the mountains. He gathered later students from golden slips, collated the Azure Records in Fangzhu, extended the ten thousand emperors’ sojourn in the curved chambers, praised the sacred instructions in the wondrous chapters, compiled the independent in equal Perfection, and strictly governed the Four Poles to regulate the kalpa. Universally ruling the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, the Five Peaks and famous mountains, the billions of Perfected Ones—none were not subject to him. The registers of life and death, even the minutest details, were all under his purview.

Later students wishing to receive the scriptures and cultivate the Dao must first submit golden slips to the Azure Palace, present jade tablets to the Highest Clarity, and be recorded by the Jade Bureau. The Dark Bureau constantly examines people’s essence and vigor; only those who are diligent and steadfast may receive the mysterious transmission.

The Old Lord further transmitted the teachings to the Great Void Perfected One, the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, commanding him to bestow them upon those who, having cultivated the Dao in past lives, bore golden names and jade characters, their names inscribed in the high pavilions, destined to become Perfected Ones. He also transmitted them to the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and the Great Perfected Lady Wang. Some were sealed within the Western Mystery’s Wangwu Mountain, others carved upon the golden pillars and jade walls of the northern chamber of Penglai’s mansion. He also used five-colored jade slips, each sealed within the stone bamboo shoots of the Five Peaks. When the renchen year arrives to announce the assembly, the Later Sage Lord will descend, retrieve them, and entrust them to the Four Assistants, who will teach the worthy among the Highest Perfected.

According to the *Arrayed Records of the Later Sage Lord Li*: the Later Sage Lord Li’s Four Assistants and High Ministers—the Azure Lad Great Lord of Fangzhu Palace, the High Guardian of the Great Cinnabar Palace and Southern Culmen Primordial Lord, the High Tutor of the White Mountain Palace and Great Plain Perfected Lord, and the High Minister of the Western City Palace and Governor of All Perfected Lords—all sought immortality by pursuing these texts, grasping their fundamental origins, and thus attaining the Dao. Those who do not know the source of the Dao or the origin of the sacred instructions grope in darkness, their learning lacking a foundation. The Perfected will not descend, and the Dao will not manifest.

The Old Lord said: “The Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures are all the Upper Dao of the Three Clarities. I once received them from the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy. For seven hundred million kalpas, as heaven and earth formed and dissolved, and the myriad beings arose and perished, only my Dao endured. Even now, I cultivate them above the Auspicious Clouds, regularly bestowing the Jade Clarity’s mysterious slips upon the Perfected Lords, and in the Heaven of Immeasurable Life, upon the Azure Lad Great Lord of Fangzhu. According to the Nine Heavens’ hierarchical standards, they emerge once every ten thousand kalpas. Since the beginning of the Kaihuang era, they have been transmitted to later students destined to become Perfected. Every nine thousand years, three may receive them; or within forty-nine years, if the right person appears, they may be transmitted all at once. Those who wish to receive my scriptures must follow the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, present precious offerings to their master, receive them to wear upon the body, and cultivate with a closed mind. Beware of careless transmission.”

According to the scriptural statutes governing the transmission of scriptures, the time limits vary. In high antiquity, when simplicity and harmony prevailed, they emerged but once in ten thousand kalpas. In this degenerate age, salvation is all the more urgent, and thus they may be transmitted upon encountering the right person within forty-nine years. All must prioritize purification through fasting and devote themselves to hidden merit, thereby redeeming the sins of the nine generations of ancestors, delivering all beings from suffering, and ultimately securing their own salvation. By establishing merit and spreading virtue, they uphold the celestial decrees and aspire to transcendence. Hence, there are twenty-seven grades of purification rites and thirty-six grades of jiao rituals. The highest employ clarity, emptiness, simplicity, and quiescence; the intermediate employ exhalation, inhalation, and the ingestion of qi; the lowest take the cleansing of the heart and repentance of transgressions as their foundation. Universally, they regard placing others before oneself as essential. With three thousand merits of practice, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight—this is attested.

It is further said: Those who wish to cultivate the supreme methods should first perform the Highest Cavern-Real Three Primordials Purification Rite. When the Three Primordials unite with the Real, they correspond above to the nine generations of ancestors. Those who wish to cultivate the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern-Real Scripture*, the *Feminine One Jade Tablet of the Five Venerable Treasure Scripture*, the *Eighty-Two Supreme Vows of the Mysterious Mother*, or to wear the Divine Tiger and Golden Tiger Talismans, wield the Seven Radiant Flowing Gold Fire Bells to dissolve demons and conceal incantations, command

Lord Lao further transmitted to the Great Lord of the Azure Youth the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text: Twenty-Four Practices of Cultivation*. Its summary states:

First is the method of gathering and ingesting flying roots and swallowing the qi of the sun. Begin by ingesting the *Luminous Opening Talisman*, constantly contemplating the moment of sunrise. Knock the teeth, silently intone the names of the sun’s essence and the characters of the Five Emperors within the sun. Visualize the five-colored streaming clouds from the sun approaching and enveloping the body, then inhale and swallow according to the method. One will feel the body suffused with jade-like luster and the face radiant with flowing light.

Next is the method of gathering and ingesting yin blossoms and swallowing the essence of the moon. Begin by ingesting the *Great Mystery Yin-Generation Talisman*, constantly contemplating the moment of moonrise. Knock the teeth, silently intone the names of the moon’s spirit and the characters of the Five Ladies within the moon. Visualize the five-colored crystalline radiance from the moon approaching and enveloping the body, then inhale and swallow according to the method. One will feel the body suffused with jade-like brilliance and the eyes alight with flying essence.

Next is the restraint of the three hun-souls. When the three hun-souls abandon the body to wander freely, swiftly departing to their original chamber, they may be detained by other spirits or captured by spectral entities. One must restrain and retain them to prevent their escape. The method involves constantly visualizing within the heart a great, revolving sphere of red and black that envelops the body, transforming into fire to illuminate the interior and exterior. Knock the teeth and intone the breath according to the method, and the three hun-souls will be restrained.

Next is the control of the seven po-souls. When the seven po-souls drift and wander through defiled and turbid realms, consorting with blood offerings, associating with ghosts and specters, clinging to corpses, or speaking of others’ transgressions and desiring their downfall—these are the afflictions of the po-souls. The method is practiced on the dark and new moons, the crescent and full moons, and the gengshen days. Visualize at the tip of the nose a gradually expanding sphere of white and black that crowns the body in nine layers, then transforms into the Four Numinous Beasts encircling the body. Intone the breath according to the method, and the seven po-souls will be refined and controlled.

Moreover, within the human body are the Three Primordial Palaces: the Upper Primordial Cinnabar Field, the Mud-Pill Palace, whose spirit is the Red Child, named Yuanxian, also called the Imperial Homeland; the Middle Primordial Cinnabar Field, the Crimson Palace, whose spirit is the Perfected One, named Zidan, also called Radiant Firmness; and the Lower Primordial Cinnabar Field, the Gate of Destiny Palace, whose spirit is the Infant, named Yuanyang, also called the Mysterious Valley. These Three Ones—clad in purple, red, and yellow robes respectively, each appearing as an infant—must be silently invoked by name and visualized in their proper attire and order when restraining the hun and po-souls.

Within the Gate of Destiny Palace resides the Great Lord, named Taokang, styled Heyan, who wears vermilion robes and a hibiscus crown, with the three hun-souls attending at his side. At night, before sleep, constantly visualize the Great Lord and invoke his guardianship according to the method for eighteen years. The Great Lord can stir the Three Fields on the left and govern the Three Blacks on the right, summoning the Yang Six Jia and the Yin Six Ding to attend the practitioner.

Furthermore, practice the *Way of Yu Yi and Jie Lin Rushing Toward Dawn*, ingest the *Numinous Flying Six Jia Yin-Yang Talismans*, wear the *Divine Tiger and Golden Tiger Demon-Dissolving Talismans of the Falling Flowing Gold*, recite the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, visualize the twenty-four spirits of the Three Sections and Eight Sceneries, ingest the *Jade-Tooth Flower Elixir*, embrace the *Yellow Water Moon Essence*, and consume the *Jade Essence of the Revolving Water and Ring of Hardness*. Then, seven-colored halos will emanate from the head, and one will achieve bodily transformation, commanding a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

These are the essential texts of Daoist cultivation, orally transmitted secrets from the Jade Clarity Lord, the Celestial Emperor of the Purple Tenuity and the Supreme Perfected of the Grand Tenuity, inscribed on purple jade tablets with azure-gold characters, with the Turtle Mother wielding the brush, the Golden Youth sweeping the mat, the Celestial Consort attending to incense, and the Jade Youth composing the text. It is titled the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text* and was bestowed upon the Prime Minister, the Great Lord of the Azure Youth, to transmit to those in the Mysterious Palace whose jade names mark them as Perfected Ones. Thereupon, the Great Lord of the Azure Youth purified himself for a thousand days, prostrated himself on hands and knees, bowed his head to the north, and, following the ritual statutes, swore the covenant before returning to the Palace of the Square Cauldron in the Empyrean.

Later, it was transmitted to the Lord of Western City, who bestowed it upon those of auspicious bone-configuration. According to the scriptures: When the Great Veil of Heaven first unfolded its myriad patterns to gather and nurture the beings of the ten directions, it first established the Nine Sages, each divided into nine ranks. From the lowest to the immortal, there are eighty-one grades, for the Three Realms were shrouded in confusion and darkness. Thus, the Three Vehicles were established as paths of cultivation, differing in the superior, middle, and inferior, universally guiding all to awakening.

In the primordial era of Dragon Han, the sagely Dao was transmitted to the Venerable of the Nine Heavens and the Perfected Sovereign of the Nine Heavens. In the era of Red Clarity, it was transmitted to the Jade Emperor of the Void Sovereign. In the era of the Supreme Sovereign, the immortal Dao was transmitted to the Firstborn of the Myriad and the Jade Sovereign of the Great Perfected. These were the transmissions of the supreme sages.

In the era of Grand Simplicity, the virtue was bestowed upon the Grand Lord of the Supreme. In the era of Grand Beginning, it was bestowed upon the Celestial Emperor. In the era of Grand Origin, it was bestowed upon the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. In the era of Grand Culmen, it was bestowed upon the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. In the era of Grand Prime, it was bestowed upon the Celestial Emperor of the Golden Watchtower and the Prime Minister, the Lord of the Azure Youth. These were the transmissions of the middle perfected.

For the transmission of teachings in later ages, there are twelve categories of the responsive and transformative Dharma-gate: (1) the original texts of the Three Caverns, (2) numinous talismans and proclamations, (3) jade instructions and secret taboos, (4) spirit diagrams and illustrations, (5) the transmission of the Dao through the ages, (6) precepts and prohibitions to prevent transgressions, (7) dignified deportment and orderly conduct, (8) methods of cultivation, (9) extended numerologies and hidden sceneries, (10) records and transmissions for instruction, (11) hymns of praise and eulogies, and (12) memorials and petitions. When the Three Caverns are thoroughly understood and responses manifest through talismanic verification, this is the transmission of the teaching in later ages.

In the era of Shaohao, Lord Lao descended upon Mount Kongtong, styled the Responsive Master, and expounded the *Scripture of Solemn Respect*, teaching compliance with the seasons. In the era of Zhuanxu, he descended upon Mount Heng, styled the Vermilion Perfected, and expounded the *Scripture of Subtle Words*, teaching the Way of loyalty and compliance. In the era of Emperor Ku, he descended by the riverside, styled the Keeper of Diagrams, and expounded the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*, teaching the Way of purity and harmony. He also commanded the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens, the Perfected Sovereigns of the Three Heavens, bearing the staffs of Nine Lights and the talismans of Scenic Clouds, to descend to the Terrace of Virtue and bestow upon Emperor Ku the *Three Heavenly Treasure Talismans of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Perfected*, to be offered above to Heaven, ensuring the Two Modes were without omission, and below to nurture humanity, ensuring lifespans were without decline.

The Emperor then performed the Heavenly sacrifice upon the altar by the Northern River, concealing the talismans upon the peaks of Mount Zhong. Later, he ascended to Heaven and became the Perfected of the Mysterious Palace. At that time, the Lord Lao transmitted the Dao to Red Pine Master, Clothed-in-Robes Master, Wang Ni, and Nibbling Secrets. This is briefly recorded in the *Tang Annals*.

According to the *Wei Shu: Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism*, the origins of the Daoist school trace back to Lord Lao, who preceded Heaven and Earth to nourish the myriad beings. Above, he dwells in Jade Capital as the ancestral deity of spirit-kings; below, he resides in Purple Tenuity as the sovereign of flying immortals. His transformations are boundless, his virtue both manifest and concealed; responding to stimuli, he adapts without fixed form. He bestowed teachings upon the Xuanyuan Emperor at Mount Emei and instructed Emperor Ku at the Terrace of Virtue. Great Yu inquired of the secrets of longevity, while Yin Xi received the essentials of the *Dao and Virtue*. The cinnabar-scripted, purple-charactered *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious and Treading the Void*, the jade, stone, and golden-light *Wondrous Existence and Cavernous Numinosity*—such texts are too numerous to recount.

The *Sui Shu: Treatise on Classics and Books* corroborates: Since ancient times, the likes of the Yellow Emperor, Emperor Ku, and Xia Yu all encountered divine beings and received the registers of the Dao. As the ages grew distant, their traces vanished from histories and records. It further states: The teachings beyond the mundane are the profound attainments of sages. When vulgar scholars engage with them, failing to grasp their essence, they often adulterate them with absurdities—this is the source of their corruption. Thus, the teachings of the *Doctrine of the Mean* are rarely expounded, yet they cannot be dismissed as false.

In the era of Emperor Yao, he descended upon Mount Gushe, styled Master Accomplished-in-Service, and expounded the *Scripture of Mysterious Virtue*, teaching the Way of humility and deference. In the era of Emperor Shun, he descended by the River’s banks at Heyang, styled Master Yin Longevity, and expounded the *Scripture of the Dao and Virtue*, teaching the Way of non-action. He also transmitted the Dao to Master Peng. This is recorded in the *Tang Annals*.

Per the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era*, the *Collected Accounts of Immortals* states: The Daoist adept Wang Miaoxiang dwelled on Mount Jiuyi in Cangwu, practicing grain abstention and qi refinement, ever reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture* and offering dawn devotions with utmost sincerity. Suddenly, a fragrant mist arose, dense and divine, while auspicious clouds filled the courtyard. Heavenly music resounded through the skies, and radiant light illuminated the altar hall. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the void, their banners and crane-canopied parasols heralding the brush of nine dragons, alighting before the altar. There appeared a transcendent official, clad in feathered robes and a bejeweled crown, girded with a sword and trailing celestial slippers, ascending the dais to sit. His body emanated five-colored light. Miaoxiang approached to pay homage.

The transcendent addressed her: "I am the sovereign of the ancient Youyu clan, Emperor Shun. Having wearied of governing the myriad states, I cultivated the Dao upon this mountain, ever desiring to guide later generations toward enlightenment. Yet the world holds none worthy of instruction. The Dao resides within, not without; it abides in your own person, not in others. As the *Mysterious Scripture* states: 'Cultivate it within yourself, and your virtue shall be true.'

Recently, the Earthly Bureau reported that you have dwelled upon this mountain for over thirty years, steadfast from beginning to end, guarding the Dao without deviation, preserving sincere devotion and upholding the mysterious precepts. Were you to achieve no realization, this would be the Dao’s abandonment of you. Yet the *Mysterious Scripture* declares: 'Ever excelling in saving beings, it abandons none.' The Dao’s benevolence is universal, desiring the perfection of all things and the salvation of all people. However, worldly beings, their fortune and virtue meager, their Dao-qi shallow, cannot persist in diligent and enduring practice. Before the Dao-qi responds, they grow lax—this is humanity’s self-abandonment of the Dao, not the Dao’s abandonment of them. With single-minded sincerity, one may aspire to realization across a hundred or a thousand lifetimes, unwavering and unrelenting. Such devotion is deeply pitiable.

In former times, I encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who revealed to me the *True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue*, teaching governance of state and self, salvation of beings, and propagation of the teachings. It spans heaven and earth, fills the cosmos, penetrates the nine heavens, and pervades the myriad things—its essence is the keystone of practice and cultivation, the foundation of realization, beyond mere words. Yet the world, steeped in superficial deceit, scorns humility as cowardice, dismisses withdrawal as ineptitude, ridicules the renunciation of sagacity as absurdity, and derides the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as perversity. Such is the delusion of this degenerate age.

The intent of the Mysterious Sages is to restore simplicity and return to the uncarved block, to honor the Dao and expel heterodoxy. Once crooked paths are cleared, the Supreme Dao naturally manifests. When simplicity is established, frivolous competition eases, rendering governance and restraint unnecessary, universal love superfluous, luminous sagacity redundant, and cunning stratagems obsolete. The world, in perfect harmony, returns to the Great Compliance—this is the grand aim of the Mysterious Sages.

Having fulfilled my allotted span, I retired to this mountain, perpetually practicing the Dao of enduring vision and non-action, dispatching transcendent officials to instruct humanity. The Supreme Sages and Lofty Perfected, moved by the impermanence of kalpas, the flux of cosmic cycles, the interplay of yin and yang, and the inexorable march of life and death, now approach the cusp of the Yang-nine and Hundred-six catastrophes. Thus, they diligently descend to teach, to save humanity—especially those who seek the Dao.

Yet those who seek the Dao waver between presence and absence, their minds distracted, scarcely one in ten thousand remaining steadfast. The Celestial Perfected, ever compassionate toward the worldly, dwell among mortals, concealing their radiance and transforming their forms to enlighten all directions. On this mountain, nine descents each possess palaces governed by true officials. Below lie treasures of jade, the five metals, divine mushrooms, and spirit herbs—medicines guarded by the Three Heavens, scriptures concealed by the Most High. Some rest in stone chambers and cloud terraces, others in sheer cliffs and secluded valleys, all overseen by numinous stewards. No venomous or predatory creatures dwell here. These may be used to transcend the world, nurture life, cultivate the Dao, and ascend to perfection.

Since residing on this mountain, you have never ventured to explore its four reaches or gaze upon its towering peaks—thus, you remain unaware. Strive in your practice, and await the day you ride the luminous chariot through the void, then shall you invert the light to fathom its origins and ends."

Thereupon, he commanded his attendants to bestow upon her the two scriptures of the *Dao and Virtue* and the *Chart of Lingering Radiance*, then departed. Thereafter, he descended to the Yellow Court Abbey once every year or three to five times. Years later, Miaoxiang ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and her abbey was renamed the Abbey of Dao-Nurturance. This mountain, where Shun cultivated the Dao, was henceforth called Dao Prefecture. Lord Lao once transmitted the *Dao and Virtue* to Shun here, as attested by the River Earl, who said: "I have guarded this text for one thousand seven hundred years."

During the reign of Yu of Xia, he descended upon Mount Shang, styled Master True Conduct, teaching the Dao of diligence and frugality, and bestowing the *Nine Categories*. He also commanded the divine envoy Xuanyi of Mount Wanwei to present the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Jade Scripture*, the true writ for controlling floods, along with the methods of pacing the void and summoning spirits to subdue demons.

When Yu governed the waters, dredging rivers and channels, Lord Lao dispatched Lady Yunhua to secretly assist him. At one point, Yu halted below Mount Wu, where a sudden tempest arose, shaking cliffs and valleys, its force uncontrollable. Suddenly, Lady Yunhua appeared, and Yu bowed, beseeching aid. She instructed her attendants to confer upon Yu the writ for summoning spirits, then commanded her divine ministers—Kuangzhang, Yuyu, Huanghui, Dayi, Gengchen, Tonglü, and the Giant Spirit—to assist in hewing rocks, dredging waves, and clearing blockages.

Yu once paid homage to Lady Yunhua atop Mount Chongsuo. In the blink of an eye, she transformed into stone, then suddenly soared aloft, dissolving into wispy clouds. At times, she settled gently, coalescing into evening rain; at others, she became a soaring dragon or a circling crane, assuming a thousand forms and myriad postures, beyond mortal reach.

Yu suspected her of being a cunning trickster, no true transcendent. He asked Tonglü: "The root of heaven and earth is the Dao; the instrument of the Dao is the Sage."

The grades of the Sage are the Perfected and the Immortals. Those who are endowed with primordial qi and attain the Dao without cultivation—such as the Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal—are the ancestral origins of the Two Primordials, the root of yin and yang, the sovereigns of the Immortal Perfected, and the first essence of creation. Lady Yunhua of the Radiant Bloom is the daughter of the Queen Mother of Metal. Having received the writ, she became Lady of the Upper Palace of Cloud Radiance, presiding over the instruction of youthful Perfected beings. Her abode is the Terrace of Jade Reflection, where she appears and vanishes in transformation—this is her constant way. She, too, congeals primordial qi to become Perfected, uniting with the Dao in form. She is not a shape born of womb or nurtured by transformation, but the primordial qi of the Lesser Yin of the Western Flower. Moreover, qi pervades heaven and earth, governs the animate and inanimate, encompasses creation in its vastness, and penetrates to the finest hair. It becomes human in humans, and thing in things—how could it be confined to soaring dragons or cranes, flying geese or phoenixes?

Yu was convinced and went to seek her. Suddenly, he beheld a terrace of cloud and jade, its jasper towers towering, divine officers standing guard in numbers beyond naming. Lions held the gates, celestial steeds opened the paths, venomous dragons and lightning beasts—all Eight Awes—stood ready at the carriage. The Lady sat in repose upon her jeweled terrace. Yu bowed his head and inquired of the Dao.

She summoned Yu to sit and said: "The Sagely Craftsman, at the inception of the great undifferentiated simplicity, divided it into countless forms. Unfurling the great storehouse’s bud, it scattered into boundless things. Thus, pacing the Three Luminaries, he established the shadow’s measure; facing the Nine Regions, he ordered the states and kingdoms. He marked the clepsydra to divide day and night, cold and heat to complete the year’s reckoning, trigram symbols to rectify the directions, mountains and rivers to separate yin and yang. He enclosed cities to gather the people, fashioned tools to defend the masses, devised carriages and robes to distinguish noble and base, and cultivated grains to prepare for famine. All these systems above take their pattern from the stars and emulate the divine Perfected, while below they nourish the realm of form.

Therefore, the sun and moon have their obscurity and brightness, life and death their cold and heat, thunder and lightning their times of emergence and retreat, wind and rain their rhythms of movement and stillness. Primordial qi floats above, while the myriad essences disperse below. The cycles of rise and fall, the turns of order and chaos, the natures of worthy and foolish, the dispositions of good and evil, the qi of firm and yielding, the fates of long and short life, the stations of noble and base, the ranks of high and low, the responses of fortune and misfortune, the appointed times of success and failure—all these are endowed by the Dao, suspended from heaven, and made manifest by the Sage.

Nature arises from heaven, but destiny is fulfilled by humans. Heaven establishes it, but the Dao enacts it. Where the Dao abides, there is being; where it departs, there is nothing. Without the Dao, things cannot endure; without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained. The Most High has said: 'Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness, and the myriad things will revert of themselves.' This means returning to the Dao and abiding constantly.

The Dao’s workings are endlessly transformative, yet never exhaust their singularity. Thus, heaven partakes of the Threefold Mystery, earth of the Primal Yellow, and humans of virtue and power. Beyond this, there is no Dao. The essentials of long endurance are: heaven preserves its mystery, earth guards its things, and humans nurture their qi—this is how wholeness is maintained. Thus, my destiny lies within me, not in heaven and earth’s slaying, nor in ghosts and spirits’ harm, but in losing the Dao and perishing of myself. Be steadfast! Be diligent! Your merit extends to things, your toil reaches the people, your goodness moves heaven—yet you have not heard of the supreme Dao.

Long ago, at the Gate of Purple Clarity, I received the writ and treasured it through diligence. My master, the Three Primordials Lord of the Dao, said: 'The *Inner Scripture of the Supreme Perfected* is the treasure of the Heavenly Perfected. Sealed in a golden terrace, worn at the Grand Tenuity, it ascends in cloud chariots, guarded by spirit tigers at the gates. Robes are shaken in the jasper chambers, feasts held in the rare groves. The Celestial Duke is ever summoned; to the right, White Mountain is nestled, gazing down upon the great void. Drifting upon the Celestial Ford, one rides clouds and spurs dragons; wandering these famed mountains, one is visited by heaven’s people in their chambers. Ten thousand spirits offer protection, a thousand essences await welcome. In motion, one has the Eight Radiance Jade Chariot; in stillness, one feasts within the Golden Terrace—this is also called the wondrous scripture of the *Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants of the Most High*.'

If you would cross vast seas without a chariot’s wheels, traverse flying sands without a cloud carriage, tread muddy paths without a conveyance, or ford waves without a vessel, then on land you would be hindered by distant barriers, and on water you would fear drifting and sinking. How, then, could you guide the hundred valleys and dredge the ten thousand streams? How perilous and distant this seems!

The Most High, moved by your utmost devotion, will bestow upon you the *True Writ of the Numinous Treasure*. On land, it will command tigers and leopards; on water, it will subdue dragons. It will sever the roots of evil, restrain the fierce, and bring your work to completion. This lies in the Yang Brightness of heaven."

She then commanded her attendant, Ling Ronghua, to bring forth the cinnabar jade coffer, open the precious writ of the Upper Clarity, and present it to Yu. She further ordered the spirits Kuangzhang, Giant Spirit, and others to assist Yu in slaying those who harmed the people and could not be restrained by human strength—executing Fangfeng at Kuaiji, and smelting the Huai River’s god Wuzhiqi at Tortoise Mountain—all by their power.

Later, Yu entered the Yang Brightness Grotto-Heaven and became the Perfected of the Purple Court, concealing the true writ in the ruins of Mount Bao. According to the *Jade Tube of Mount Taixiu*, the Grotto-Heaven of the Law and Music is where the Most High bestowed the *True Writ of the Numinous Treasure* upon Yu, and its traces remain there. Today, the Grotto-Heaven of Linwu in Dongting Mountain within Lake Tai—also called Mount Bao—is where Yu concealed the true writ. In the twelfth year of King Helü of Wu, in the first month, he ascended Mount Bao and commanded the recluse, the Venerable Dragon Might, to enter the mountain’s grotto and explore its depths. There, he saw golden walls and jasper chambers, inscribed: *Hall of the Grand Yin, Separate Palace of the Queen of Heaven*. Upon a jade table within the chamber, he found a plain silk scroll of one hundred seventy-four characters, which he brought back.

King Helü, unable to recognize the script, dispatched an envoy to inquire of Confucius, saying: "A red crow delivered a writ to the king." Confucius replied: "Once, while I traveled by the Western Sea, I heard a children’s rhyme that went: *The King of Wu goes forth to view the trembling lake, / Dragon Might the Recluse, by name, dwells in seclusion. / North he climbs Mount Bao, enters the numinous ruins, / Then to Dongting he goes, to steal Yu’s writ in secret. / Heaven’s great writ must not be unfurled— / This text has long transmitted six hundred springs. / Now forced to take it out, the kingdom’s halls shall fall.* I interpret the rhyme to mean that Dragon Might the Venerable found it in the grotto, brought forth by the red crow—beyond this, I know nothing." The King of Wu, struck with fear, returned the writ.

During the reign of Tang of Shang, the writ descended upon Mount Qian, where he was called Master Bestowed-by-Then, expounded the *Scripture of Longevity*, and taught the Way of reverence and compassion. Today, the site of the Dragon Hall before the Heavenly Blessing Palace on Mount Qian marks the very place.

Though the Old Master had manifested across the ages, no trace of his birth had yet appeared. Wishing to harmonize his light with the dust to establish the teachings of the world, he first commanded the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden to descend and become the daughter of the Yin family of Tianshui, named Yishou, who married the immortal Li Lingfei. The Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden was none other than the Supreme Primordial Sovereign. Lingfei was a descendant of Gaoyao, and by the time of Shang, father and son had inherited the Way of cultivating life. His father, Qingbin, lived over a hundred years yet retained a youthful countenance, wandering the Five Peaks and all the mountains. One day, a cloud and dragon descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Inspired by his father’s ascension, Lingfei refined the Great Dao with diligence and also lived over a hundred years. He ascended to heaven before the Old Master’s birth.

In the seventeenth year of King Yangjia’s reign, the tenth sovereign of the eighteenth Shang dynasty, in the gengshen year, the Old Master divided his spirit from the Great Clarity’s immortal realm, riding the essence of the sun and driving nine dragons, transforming into a five-colored flowing pearl to descend. At that time, Lady Yin was napping when she dreamed the sky opened for several yards, and a host of immortals bore forth the sun. After a long while, she saw the sun gradually shrink, falling from the heavens as a five-colored pearl the size of a pellet. She cupped it in her hands and swallowed it, awakening to find herself with child. Today, the Meteor Altar at the Heavenly Tranquility Palace in Bozhou marks the spot. From then on, her complexion grew ever more youthful, her spirit serene and composed. The chamber where she dwelt harmonized the six qi, winter knew no biting cold, summer no scorching heat. Auspicious light illuminated the room, no evil could assail her, and eighty-one years passed without her noticing their length.

In the ninth year of King Wuding’s reign, the twenty-second sovereign of Shang, in the gengchen year, on the fifteenth day of the second month (the first month of the lunar year), at the hour of mao, the Sacred Mother, grasping a branch of the plum tree, suddenly gave birth from beneath her left armpit. The immortal traditions all record that he remained in the womb for eighty-one years, though the *Inner Tradition* states: "The Sovereign, Preceptor of the High Emperor, was moved by the essence of the sun entering her mouth and conceived. After seventy-two years, he emerged from her left armpit." Though the two accounts differ, there is reason: Yu Xuan’s *Record of the Northern Frontier* states: "Laozi remained in the womb for seventy-two years, and the signs appeared for nine years"—which also totals eighty-one years.

At that moment, the sun’s radiance doubled in brilliance, auspicious clouds shaded the courtyard, ten thousand cranes soared in the sky, and the Nine Heavens rejoiced. Jade maidens knelt to receive him, and nine dragons offered water to bathe his sacred form. The pool from which the dragons emerged became the Nine Wells. According to Fu Tao’s *Record of the Northern Expedition* from the Han: "Within the Old Master’s temple are nine wells, all interconnected, so that drawing water from one causes all nine to stir."

At his birth, he took nine steps, with a lotus blossoming at each step. Pointing to the plum tree, he said: "This shall be my surname." The Old Master had once, in kalpas past, been born in the Li Valley of the Northern Mysterious Jade Kingdom, and thus took the surname Li. Now, born again into the Li family beneath a plum tree, he knew his surname at birth and pointed it out to others—not that he had only now adopted Li as his surname.

His posthumous name was Cong, for the Old Master’s ears rose above his neck, thick and firm, with hanging pearls and three openings within—a countenance of a celestial spirit, unlike that of ordinary men, hence the name. Some write it as *Xiu*, as the characters were interchangeable in Han script. Thus, the *Records of the Grand Historian* also writes it as *Taishi Xiu*, just as *Xiu* in Xiuzhou means "ear." Some write it as *Dan*, a corruption of the sound. Others claim he stuck out his tongue and spoke, hence the name *Ci*—but this is merely a mishearing.

His name was Er, and his courtesy name Boyang. Some call him Boyang Fu, a term of reverence for the aged. Another name was Ya, courtesy name Bozong; another, Zhi, courtesy name Boguang; another, Shi, courtesy name Menggong; another, Chong, courtesy name Ziwen; another, Ding, courtesy name Yuanyang; another, Yuan, courtesy name Boshi; another, Xian, courtesy name Yuansheng; another, De, courtesy name Bowen. According to the *Scripture of the Nine Palaces*, the *Scripture of the Three and Five*, and the *Scripture of the Primordial Epochs*, each person has their own trials and encounters. If one changes their name to align with the sounds of the primordial brilliance, they may extend their years and avoid calamity. Many Daoists of the present age do likewise. The *Arrayed Records* also states: "The Master Li changes his name and courtesy name every two thousand five hundred years." The Old Master remained in the world the longest, hence his many names and courtesy names. He once told Yin Xi: "My surnames and names stretch endlessly across kalpas—none can record them all."

On the ninth day after his birth, the Old Master’s body underwent nine transformations, each time clad in celestial crowns and celestial robes that naturally draped his form. He bore the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. The seventy-two marks included: a head round as heaven, a face radiant as the sun, a coiled rhinoceros horn rising from his brow, a jade bowl’s arch crowning his head. His hair was white as a crane’s, over seven feet long. His eyebrows resembled the Northern Dipper, their color emerald green. His whiskers were tiger-like, his beard dragon-like, white and knotted like silk. His ears bore hanging pearls, with three openings within, rising level with his crown, thick and firm. His eyes were like the Yellow River and the sun and moon, with square pupils and green veins.

The Old Master’s nose bore twin pillars, its bridge high and prominent. His mouth was square as the sea, his lips red as cinnabar. His beard held a purple hue, its fragrance like orchid. His teeth were arrayed like cowrie shells, firm as silver, thirty-two in number, evenly aligned above and below. His tongue was long and broad, patterned like brocade, its sound like jade, its resonance like gold. His forehead rose high and full, his jaw square as a carpenter’s square. His temples bore the sun’s angle and the moon’s depth, his countenance golden, his bearing jadelike, his dragon visage solemn, his phoenix gaze serene. His brow shone with radiant signs, three yang energies ascending. His celestial court was level and vast, his golden coffer brimming. His cheeks bore white marks, his jowls jade-like orbs. His neck had three folds, white as a crane’s, held proudly aloft. His arms hung past his knees, his hands bore ten lines, his fingers long and slender, each inscribed with trigrams. His nails were jade-like, his body bore green down, his chest had recumbent bones, his back the River Chariot. His navel was over an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His heart bore brocade patterns, his abdomen a dark mark, his eyes wheel-like veins, his feet trod the two fields, his toes held heaven and earth. His height was twelve feet, his body exuded fragrance. His face was square and lustrous, its three divisions aligned. His form was adamantine, his appearance crystalline, his gait like a tiger’s stride, his movement like a dragon’s rush. Such were his marks.

To his left stood the Azure Dragon, to his right the White Tiger; before him the Vermilion Bird led, behind him the Dark Warrior followed. His head was shaded by purple clouds, his feet trod lotus blossoms, his neck bore twin luminaries, five lights shone like the sun. His body held the celestial sphere, his movements illuminated the nine heavens. Possessing the full countenance of an immortal, his radiance and hue were wondrously fair. These eighty-one traits were called his excellences.

He gestated for eighty-one years, fulfilling the supreme yang’s nine-by-nine reckoning. Born with hoary hair, he was thus named the Old Master. The ancients styled their teachers as *zi*, and *zi* was also a general term for men, hence he was called *Laozi*. Another account holds that *lao* denotes longevity, while *zi* signifies youth, thus he was called Old, yet also newly born, hence *zi*. Moreover, his white-haired appearance united the two principles, so he was styled *Laozi*.

Tang scholar Yin Wencao observed: *Laozi* is the embodied Dao. Though its manifestations differ inwardly and outwardly, they arise from its responsive nature, hence its forms may vary. Its inner appellations include the Supreme One, True One, Mysterious One, August One, Primordial One, Imperial One, Grand One, Celestial One, and Orthodox One. The Supreme One is wondrous and without substance; the True One is pure and profoundly still; the Mysterious One is spiritually unobstructed; the August One is supremely luminous; the Primordial One is the chief of the myriad ways; the Imperial One is the sacred lord of the hundred spirits; the Grand One is the great sovereign of long life; the Celestial One is the true ruler of yin; the Orthodox One is the dharma-king of radiant majesty. These nine meanings, though differently named, spring from the same source. Having grasped the mysterious mechanism, they are all called *One*.

Its outer appellations include Yuhua, Dacheng, Guangshou, Guangcheng, Suiying, Chijing, Lutu, Wucheng, Yinshou, Zhenxing, Xize, Xieyi, Yucheng, Jingcheng, and Guoshu, among others. *Yuhua* denotes the Dao’s flourishing transformation; *Dacheng* its universally bestowed mysterious virtue; *Guangshou* its joyful spirit and sustaining abundance; *Guangcheng* its vast life-nurturing merit; *Suiying* its unimpeded responsiveness; *Chijing* its revered numinous cinnabar; *Lutu* its hidden accord with talismanic destiny; *Wucheng* its fulfillment of manifold achievements; *Yinshou* its impartiality and robust health; *Zhenxing* its pure sincerity; *Xize* its benevolent and methodical kindness; *Xieyi* its transformative moral influence; *Yucheng* its harmonious nurturing; *Jingcheng* its enduring and complete orthodox teachings; *Guoshu* its purging of generations of encumbrances. These names arose in accord with his teachings, and as he descended to become the state’s preceptor, they all bore the title *zi*.

He dwelt on the northern bank of the Wo River in Quren Village, Lai Township, Ku County, in the state of Song. According to the *Records of the Historian*, he was a native of Quren Village, Lai Township, Ku County in Chu. Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of Exemplary Women* calls him a man of Chen, while Huangfu Mi’s *Biographies of Lofty Scholars* says he was a minister of Chu who resided on the northern bank of the Wo River. Some say he was from Qiao, and *Lai* may also be written as *Li*. The discrepancies in these accounts stem from the fact that the region was the ancient domain of Fuxi, beside Wanqiu, where Emperor Zhuanxu also established his capital. According to the *Tribute of Yu*, it fell within the jurisdiction of Yingzhou. King Tang of Shang later made it his capital, calling it Bo Shang. When King Wu of Zhou conquered Shang, he enfeoffed the descendants of Shun, naming them Yu, at Wanqiu, thus founding the state of Chen. Xiong Yi’s initial enfeoffment connected his lands to Chen, forming the state of Chu. In the eleventh year of Duke Xuan of Lu, Chu destroyed Chen, but Shen Shu Shi admonished the king, and Chen was restored. In the eighth year of Duke Zhao, Chu again destroyed Chen and made it a county. By the thirteenth year, Chu had re-enfeoffed Chen, but in the seventeenth year of Duke Xiang, Chen was finally annihilated by Chu and became part of its territory. When King Qingxiang of Chu was defeated by Qin, he lost his armies and the capital of Ying, relocating to Chen. After Qin conquered Chu, Chen became part of Yingchuan Commandery. Under the Han, it became the Principality of Huaiyang, with its seat at Chen, governing nine counties, including Ku, Xiang, Qiao, and Li, all under its jurisdiction. During the reign of Emperor Zhang of the Later Han, it was renamed Chen Commandery, and today it is known as Bo Prefecture.

Ku County: Xu Guang notes that during the Jin dynasty, it was called Guyang, which was abolished under the Qi, then reestablished by the Sui. The former city of Guyang in eastern Ku County was the ancient city of Li Township. Northeast of the county lies the ancient city of Xiang, which was Xiang County in Chu. By the end of the Warring States period, Xiang was merged into Ku. In the first year of the Qianfeng era of the Tang, it was renamed Zhenyuan County, and today it is known as Weizhen County. To the north flows the Wo River, and forty *li* to the east stands the ancient city of Qiao, which was Qiao County in the Han.

The elders thus variously refer to Laozi as a man of Chen, Chu, Xiang, or Qiao. Li Township is none other than Lai Township. The *Zuo Tradition* states: "King Cheng of Chu attacked Xu, and the Qin army attacked Li to rescue it." Du Yu notes: "Li was an ally of Chu." The *Treatise on Geography* records: "It belonged to Huaiyang; Wang Mang renamed it Lai Ling." Pei Songzhi’s *Record of the Northern Campaign*, Li Daoyuan’s *Classic of Waterways*, and Kuo Xi’s *Illustrated Gazetteer of the Thirteen Provinces* all write it as *Lai*, but as the place lies near the Wo River, the common folk altered it to *Lai* (濑).

When the Holy Mother had given birth to the Dao-body and was about to return to the heavenly palace to resume the position of Primordial Lord, wishing to demonstrate to the world the Way of master-disciple transmission, she addressed Lord Lao: "Humans are born within Heaven and Earth, some pure, some turbid. Those of pure essence are wise, kind, and benevolent; those of turbid qi are foolish, cruel, and violent. The enlightened cultivate to perfect their nature; the benighted indulge their desires to harm their lives. Nature is the source of the body; life is the root of existence. Thus, those who cultivate and study refine their bodies with the Nine Elixirs, untie the knots of the Five Spirits, guide their qi back to its origin, and sever the roots at the Three Passes. After nine refinements and ten transformations, with a hundred joints illuminated and the knots of the womb dissolved, they come to know their original truth and ascend as perfected immortals. Without cultivation, demonic forces invade the body, a hundred illnesses arise, and death comes before life’s span is complete—such suffering is beyond words.

Immortality arises from the heart’s study; sincerity of heart brings immortality to fruition. The Dao values inner seeking; inner secrecy draws the Dao near. One who attains stillness to study the true, accumulates emptiness to commune with spirits, draws ever closer to immortality. But if the heart races and the spirit labors, the body grows restless and unfocused, movement and stillness dissipate essence, and the ears and eyes grow distracted—then, though one may accumulate years in vain pursuit of the Dao, the Dao only recedes further. Our sojourn in Heaven and Earth is but a fleeting moment. If one can gather qi to nourish the spirit, endure hardship to concentrate the true, and persist long enough, one will attain the Dao and dwell with Heaven and Earth in the Great Void. One who penetrates emptiness and embodies non-being becomes invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, and merges with the Dao in truth."

Lord Lao said: "Now that I wander the dusty world, can I yet attain perpetual life and deliver others in accordance with the times?"

The Primordial Lord replied: "I possess secret treasures, transmitted only to the sagely. Those who cultivate them may attain everlasting life."

Lord Lao said: "I wish to hear of their attainment."

The Primordial Lord said: "The supreme Dao is profound and abstruse, beyond knowing—neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. It cannot be seen, nor grasped. It encompasses Heaven and Earth, yet the perfected person remains boundless. It lies within all bodies, yet none can fathom it. To know its principles is to possess dark virtue."

Lord Lao said: "Does the Dao have means to attain it?"

The Primordial Lord replied: "The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and penetration; the arts are the wondrous techniques of transformation. The Dao employs the arts to aid humanity; humans, through cultivation, unite with the Dao—thus transformations become inexhaustible. The essence of the Dao lies in non-action and spontaneity; the secrecy of the arts lies in talismans and elixirs. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, Heaven’s pledge of faith. Elixirs are the blossoms of the Five Phases, the essence of Earth. Qi is the harmony of yin and yang, the spirit of the myriad things. Though one may master a single practice, one must ultimately rely on talismans, elixirs, and the Dao to complete the work. These are my secret treasures. If you can master them all, you may attain everlasting life and deliver countless beings."

Lord Lao said: "The body is the vessel for attaining the Dao; qi is the root of life’s destiny. When the root is severed, life ends; when the vessel decays, the Dao departs. Now that I wish to cultivate, how may I secure life and exalt the Dao?"

The Primordial Lord replied: "Humans are endowed with a form of flesh and bone, like the unfired clay of a potter. Exposed to wood and fire, it quickly decays; without refinement, life is brief—such is the principle. Even one whose virtue surpasses all beings, whose spirit communes with the Great Mystery, may yet fear the inevitability of old age and death. Why? Because transformation dictates it; it cannot be otherwise. Only elixirs can refine the body; only talismans can summon the spirits. When spirits return, the heart is enlightened and nature at ease; when the body is firm, qi is stabilized and life preserved. Then, one transforms qi into essence, penetrates formlessness, soars through the void, and exists in spontaneity—thus attaining everlasting life. Though the perfected may encounter cataclysm, with Heaven and Earth collapsing, no disaster can reach them. This is why talismans and elixirs are prized."

Lord Lao said: "Those who ingest the divine elixir and attain longevity—is it due to the protection of spirits, or the power of the elixir?"

The Primordial Lord replied: "The merit of longevity lies in the elixir; the elixir’s completion lies in the spirits. Thus, when compounding the elixir, one must rectify the heart and avoid transgressions, so that the numinous spirits may protect it, and the elixir’s creation be assured. When the divine elixir enters the mouth, life becomes boundless. Heaven and Earth witness clearly: the Dao returns to the benevolent. The teeming masses, mere walking corpses, do not believe in the attainability of longevity, dismissing it as empty falsehood. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in acts that hasten death—how can Heaven force life upon them? Indulging desires to the utmost, they perish in an instant. A thousand pieces of gold spent on funerals—what benefit is there? When the divine elixir and the Dao are perfected, one not only attains longevity but may also become a treasure of the age. Those who know this Dao—what need have they for the world? If a ruler offered his kingdom in exchange for my formula, I would not transmit it to the unworthy."

Lord Lao bowed deeply and said: "I wish to hear its essentials."

The Primordial Lord then raised her gaze to the heavens and let out a long whistle. Suddenly, a purple cloud like a canopy descended from the sky, within which five-colored vapors radiated light in all directions. The immortal Juanzi attended her. The Primordial Lord produced the *Divine Charts*, the *Precious Chapters of Transformations*, the methods of *Returning the Elixir*, *Subduing Fire*, *Water Mercury*, and *Golden Liquor*—seventy-two scrolls in all—and bestowed them upon Lord Lao.

The text states:

For the *Xuanbai* to give birth to the *Golden Duke*, the *Great Yang Flowing Pearl* enters the *Flowery Pool* with five taels of *Wenjiang*, *Luochi* salt, and *White Snow*, forming the *Male-Female Five Talismans* and *Nine Elixirs*, which enable one to ascend as a perfected immortal. The Dao lies herein, yet people remain unaware.

The *Five Talismans* are: first, *Xuanbai*; second, *Essence of Gold*; third, *Flying Talisman*; fourth, *Golden Florescence*; fifth, *Essence of the Three-Five Azure Dragon*.

The *Nine Elixirs* are: first, *White Snow Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; second, *Male-Female Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; third, *Golden Liquor Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; fourth, *White Florescence Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; fifth, *Elixir Florescence Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; sixth, *Five-Color Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; seventh, *Mud Mercury Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; eighth, *Essence of Gold Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir*; ninth, *Nine Cauldrons Radiant Ultimate Elixir*. Of these nine elixirs, obtaining even one allows one to attain longevity—there is no need for hasty practice.

The Dao of the divine elixir undergoes three transformations and five cyclical turns, culminating at nine. Those who ingest it become equal to me.

The Dao of immortality does not lie in sacrifices or prayers to spirits, nor in *daoyin* or bending and stretching, nor in recitations or verbose speech, nor in exhausting oneself through intense contemplation. The essence of longevity lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is exceedingly easy, but achieving it is profoundly difficult—only those who can practice it may endure.

This Dao, once established, grants transcendence. Even I did not attain it naturally but through study.

Lord Lao bowed again, pressing his forehead to the ground, and said: "I have received your gracious instruction on the Nine Elixirs. Yet I have heard that those who seek transcendence without obtaining the *Golden Liquor* labor in vain. I humbly request you reveal its essentials."

The Primordial Lord said: "Your question is most profound. The Nine Elixirs and the *Golden Liquor* are both paths to ascending to heaven, yet among the Nine Elixirs, the *Golden Liquor* is supreme. The reason is this: those who ingest the Nine Elixirs may be received by immortal officials with clouds and dragons after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, sixty days, thirty days, ten days, or even three days. But those who ingest the *Golden Liquor* transform upon tasting it—their bodies take on the hue of purple gold, and they instantly grow feathers and wings, ascending to become immortal officials.

To ingest it, one must first observe a prolonged fast and abstain from grains for a full year before partaking. Unless one bears the *Mysterious Thread* within or possesses the name of the deathless, one shall never hear of the Dao of the Nine Elixirs and *Golden Liquor*.

Its method follows the prior process of compounding the golden elixir into a liquid—thus is the Dao complete. This is my secret treasure, containing one thousand two hundred formulas.

Five kalpas ago, before the dust of worlds and the formation of heaven and earth, I received it from the *Primordial Celestial Worthy*. Practicing it, I attained the rank of *Supreme Primordial Lord*. In the past, I transmitted it to the *Perfected Great Sage, Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Lord*, and the *Celestial Lords of Grand Tenuity and Grand Unity*. Now I bestow it upon you—strive diligently."

Lord Lao received the transmission and again inquired: "The teeming multitudes, countless as the grasses, are all bound for the realm of death. If this Dao were broadly bestowed to deliver them, how might that be?"

The Primordial Lord said: "The careless masses, lost in glory and desire, perish like stones cast into rivers—gone, never to return. Their plight is deeply lamentable. Yet the Dao does not operate in vain; it must be entrusted to the true person. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Nine Mysteries, its transmission as rare as the jade terraces of the clouds—once in ten thousand years. It is recorded in the *Mysterious Registers* and *Jade Names*. Unless one is destined by former lives, with the bone and countenance of an immortal, one shall not hear of it. Foolish people err frequently—how could one defy celestial law by recklessly transmitting it?

My teachings are now complete. I shall depart. The *Celestial Harmony Primordial Lord* shall speak with you further."

As her words concluded, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the perfected immortals of the Five Thearchs, surrounded her eight-jewel jade carriage to escort her as she ascended to heaven.

The methods of the *Great Clarity Divine Elixir Scripture* originate from the *Supreme Primordial Lord*. Her divine powers harmonize yin and yang, command wind and rain, advance and retreat the five stars, regulate cold and heat, and harness nine dragons and twelve white tigers. All immortals under heaven revere and submit to her. The life and death of humanity are governed by her—it is said that ingesting the elixir brings this about.

Lord Lao then wandered through mountains and marshes in search of refining the divine elixir. Passing through *Lao Mountain*, he indeed encountered the *Grand Unity Primordial Lord* riding a five-colored striped qilin, attended by ten officials. Lord Lao followed her to inquire of the Dao. The Primordial Lord said: "The essence of the Dao lies in the *Cyclically Transformed Elixir* and *Golden Liquor*." Thereupon, she transmitted the secret formulas.

In later years, on *Li Mountain*, he again met the *Grand Unity Primordial Lord* and expressed gratitude for the divine elixir’s method. The Primordial Lord said: "You are the honored one among all immortals, the master of the ten thousand Dao. The mysterious and numinous secret arts are inherently part of your nature—why should you humble yourself with thanks?"

Lord Lao said: "The common people, ignorant and dying in great numbers, move my heart to tears of blood. Witnessing this sorrow, I wish to provide them with the divine medicine so that all may attain longevity. Would this be permissible?"

The Primordial Lord said: "It cannot be. The Dao of life is most weighty—it must be entrusted to the greatly virtuous, the filial, the sincere, and the faithful. Heaven generates the ten thousand things, some good, some evil. The good deserve to live; the evil deserve to be eradicated. It is not fitting to dispense the medicine so that all may live indefinitely. You already know this—do not transmit it lightly."

The *Sacred Record* praises:

Lord Lao embodies the quiescence of the Great Void,
His virtue draws from the wondrous existence.
He perfected the Dao through kalpas uncounted,
Shaping transformations across ten thousand heavens.
Spontaneous, not through accumulated study,
He descended through nine sovereigns to establish teachings,
Entrusted through successive emperors as their master.
Alone in the Purple Clarity,
Who could precede him?
Now he seeks the *Holy Mother* to entrust his learning,
Follows the *Primordial Lord* to inquire of the Dao,
Desiring to manifest the true Dao’s profundity—
Without study, it cannot be attained.
The lofty and marvelous path of immortals,
Through cultivation, may be grasped.
Thus he honors the master and esteems virtue,
Abides in the feminine and guards the yielding,
Exemplifying the numinous model of the supreme sage,
Bequeathing a wondrous pattern for future ages.
Adapting to circumstances, he teaches,
Rewarding the good and chastising the deluded.
*Wenshi* and *Baopu* were lost before,
Now they are praised in turn thereafter.

Lord Lao, knowing the Dao of immortals must rely on cultivation, wished to bequeath its methods to encourage later generations. Thus, he preserved authenticity and embraced the One, refined cinnabar to restore the primordial, and only then could he ride the void and ascend the heavens, moving between existence and non-existence at will, his whereabouts unfathomable to mortals. One day, he mounted a white deer, trod upon the cypress of the courtyard, and ascended to heaven.

*The Second Scroll of the Sacred Records of the Primordial Sage* concludes here.

---

In the twenty-first year of King Zhou of Shang, the *dingmao* year, on the twelfth day of the first month, the *bingwu* day, Lord Lao, witnessing King Zhou’s tyranny and the people’s suffering, saw that King Wen of Zhou, as the Western Earl, possessed a benevolent heart and would aid the virtuous to deliver the people. He then divided his black-transformed body, rode the chariot of the flying terrace, and descended south of Mount Qi. Eighteen *li* northeast of present-day Fengxiang Prefecture stands the Temple of the Sage’s Advent, the very site of his descent, where the Terrace of the Western Earl’s Reception of the Dao and its remnants remain.

He styled himself *Xieyizi* and expounded the *Scripture of Crimson Essence*, teaching people the Dao of benevolence and trust. The Western Earl, having heard of him, summoned him as the Keeper of Archives. When King Wu overthrew Shang and ascended the throne, he was transferred to the position of Historian Beneath the Pillars and renamed *Yuchengzi*, composing the *Scripture of Wandering Play*. During the reign of King Cheng, he was called *Jingchengzi* and expounded the *Scripture of Vast Transformation*. Later, he transmitted the Dao to the Duke of Zhou and retired to a life of leisure. He journeyed to the westernmost lands of Da Qin and Zhuqian, styling himself *Ancient Master*. In the time of King Kang, he returned to Zhou, called himself *Guoshuzi*, and again served as Historian Beneath the Pillars.

According to the *Genealogical Records of the Ages*: in Shang, he was the Keeper of Archives; in Zhou, the Historian Beneath the Pillars. This is because King Wen, though a lord, still served Shang. Lord Lao, as a hidden dragon in a humble position, nurtured the Zhou’s Dao. By the time of King Zhao, Lord Lao knew the Zhou house would decline, so he transmitted the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens* to the king, bidding him safeguard the nation’s destiny. King Zhao, believing himself to dwell in the course of nature, gradually relaxed his vigilance, indulging in tours and neglecting celestial patterns. Lord Lao, foreseeing the king would not meet a proper end, withdrew the celestial writings and returned to his native place.

Though Lord Lao dwelt in Zhou for a long time, he always prioritized concealment and anonymity, outwardly harmonizing with the world while inwardly maintaining purity and emptiness, never allowing fame or rank to become prominent. The Later Han scholar Bian Shao composed the *Stele Inscription of Lord Lao’s Temple*, stating: "Lord Lao delighted in namelessness, guarded against virtue, shunned high office, and found peace in lowly positions." Its inscription reads:

> Veiled in primordial virtue,
> Embracing emptiness and guarding purity,
> Delighting in lowly station,
> Unmoved by power or emolument.
> Vast and boundless through the ages,
> None knew his true nature.
> In non-action alone,
> The great transformation of Zhou was perfected.
> Advancing and retreating without constancy,
> Interweaving constancy with change,
> Feigning foolishness with wisdom,
> Abundant yet never full.

From this inscription, the sage’s comings and goings may be discerned.

Lord Lao, wishing to enlighten the Western Regions, in the twenty-third year of King Zhao of Zhou, the *guichou* year—the first year of the Heaven of No Limit—on the *renwu* day of the fifth month, harnessed a chariot drawn by a blue ox, its canopy made of thin planks, with Xu Jia as his driver, and set out to cross the Han Pass westward. The Sui scholar Xue Daoheng composed the *Inscription for the Temple Courtyard*, saying:

> Though the Five Peaks are small,
> The Nine Provinces are narrow.
> I shall soar high and wander afar,
> Transcending the distant.
> The blue ox is harnessed,
> The purple radiance floats ahead.
> The gates of mystery open wide,
> The divine transformation flows unseen.

This speaks of his intent to transform the Western Regions. The *Records of the Western Expedition* state: "He crossed the Hangu Pass." Li Kang’s *Inscription for the Hangu Pass* says: "Yin Xi invited Lord Lao to stay, composing two scrolls before concealing them." *Mystic Serenity* states: "He exited the Long Pass westward." Cui Hao says: "Xi served as the Chief of the San Pass." The *Illustrated Classic of Qin* records a city of Yin Xi beside the San Pass, suggesting that during the reign of King Kang of Zhou, Xi may have served as the Chief of the San Pass. Since historical records merely mention "crossing the pass" without specifying the location, later scholars have offered various interpretations, much like the multiple sites of Chao and Xu’s ox-drinking or Bo Yi and Shu Qi’s Mount Shouyang. However, the Long Pass and San Pass both lie in Qin and Long, while the Hangu Pass is located twelve *li* south of Taolin County in Shanzhou, where the ruins of the old pass remain. According to the *Illustrated Classic* and oral traditions, all confirm that the pass Lord Lao crossed was indeed the old Hangu Pass. In ancient times, King Wu of Zhou resided in Haojing, and though King Cheng built Luoyi, he still returned to Western Zhou. Only when King Ping moved east to Luoyi did the capital shift. The *Inner Records of Louguan* state that King Kang appointed Xi as a grandee, while the *Inner Records of Yin Xi* say Xi served as the Pass Chief. If Xi was the Chief of the San Pass during King Kang’s reign, and Lord Lao met him upon exiting the pass during King Zhao’s time, the chronology aligns smoothly. However, the *Inner Records* state that upon exiting the pass, he arrived at Xi’s residence, which was in Zhengwu County west of the Hangu Pass—had he truly exited the pass, Xi’s residence would not have been there. The Hangu Pass lies east of Haojing, and Lord Lao was further east of the Hangu Pass. The *Immortal Duke* interpreted his westward journey as "departing Zhou," hence "crossing west." If one claims Lord Lao met Confucius before exiting the pass, then the crossing would have occurred after the eastern relocation, by which time the lands of the Long and San Passes were already under Qin’s control, making it impossible to refer to the Hangu Pass as the San or Long Pass.

According to the *Genealogical Records of the Ages*, Qin’s distant ancestor Feizi first dwelled in Taiqiu, mingling with the Rong tribes in the lands of present-day Qizhou.

When King Xiao of Zhou dispatched Feizi to raise horses between the Qi and Wei Rivers, his merit earned him an initial grant of land at Qin—specifically, Qinting in Longxi. During the reign of King Li, the Western Rong rebelled against Zhou, and Qin Zhong was sent to suppress them, whereupon he was rewarded with the lands of Taiqiu. Unable to hold them, Qin Zhong returned to Qinting. Later, when Duke Xiang escorted King Ping in his eastern relocation, the king bestowed upon him the lands west of Qi. Qin then hunted eastward to the region between the Ji and Wei Rivers, and reflecting on the origins of his ancestors’ enfeoffment, divined to settle east of Long.

Duke Mu defeated Jin at Hanyuan, extending his borders eastward to the Yellow River. Duke Xian gradually moved east and established his capital at Liyang, while Duke Xiao developed Jique, calling it Xianyang. Tracing this lineage, Qin first dwelled in Qin west of Long, then moved east to the region between the Qi and Wei Rivers. Thus, in Confucius’s time, Long and San Passes lay at the heart of Qin’s territory—why would a pass have been established there?

The reason San Pass bears the city of Yin Xi is that during King Nan’s reign, Lord Lao and the Perfected Master Yin were ascending Kunlun and passed through this route. King Zhao of Qin ordered a city built there to mark the occasion, hence the Wayfarer’s Post of Lord Lao and the City of Yin Xi. Later scholars, seeing Yin Xi’s city at this site, mistakenly assumed San Pass was where he held office. But since the Zhou pass already stood there, one cannot claim that Lord Lao crossed the pass only to reach Yin’s residence.

Verifying the facts, the place where Yin Xi served as magistrate and where Lord Lao encountered him must be fixed at the Hangu Pass. In the first year of the Tianbao era of the Tang, the Heavenly Treasure Numinous Talisman hidden by Lord Lao was unearthed there, prompting an imperial edict to rename Taolin County as Lingbao County and establish the Lingfu Abbey on the site. Emperor Minghuang personally paid homage and composed an inscribed stele erected within the abbey. Later, Emperor Zhenzong of the Song also composed an *Inscription on Crossing the Pass*, carved into stone.

Initially, Yin Xi, aspiring to the Dao and its safeguarding, cherished from youth the *Three Tombs* and *Eight Canons*, excelling in celestial portents and astrological calculations. He built a thatched tower to gaze upon the heavens, contemplating the mysterious Dao, and was thus called the Tower Observer. There, he beheld a purple aura advancing westward from the east, a celestial omen signaling that a sage would cross the pass. He sought appointment as magistrate of the Hangu Pass, and the king consented.

Yin Xi, styled Gongwen, served as a grandee during King Kang’s reign and was later summoned to the eastern court as a guest of honor. According to the *Inner Transmission*, his mother once dreamed in daylight of a crimson mist swirling around her, which she swallowed. When Yin Xi was born, a numinous radiance hovered beside him, and his eyes held the essence of the sun. From childhood, he loved the ancient texts and excelled in celestial divination and esoteric prognostication, observing and scrutinizing all things with penetrating clarity—even spirits could not conceal their truths from him. Broad-minded and heroic, he spurned conventional rites, humbling himself to aid others without seeking fame. His reputation spread far, and he was summoned as a guest of honor to the eastern court before being appointed magistrate of the pass.

Liu Xin’s *Seven Summaries* states: "The Master of the Pass, named Xi, was an officer of the pass." Both the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Biographies of the Immortals* refer to him as Yin Xi of the Pass, though it remains unclear whether "Yin" was his surname or his title as chief of the pass. As the *Zhuangzi* records, "Liezi inquired of the Master of the Pass," suggesting "Yin" denoted his rank. Today, those surnamed Yin likely descend from him, implying that Xi was the "Yin" (chief) of the pass, and the surname derived from his office.

However, the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden was born into the Yin family of Tianshui, and both the *Inner Transmission* and *Biographies of the Divine Immortals* refer to him as "Magistrate Yin of the Pass." According to the *Rites of Zhou*, each pass was overseen by two senior officers and four middle officers, with two junior officers per pass handling its opening and closing. Thus, the junior officers managed the gates, while the *Sikuan* (Controller of the Pass) served as chief of all passes. The *Zhuangzi* mentions a "Gate Yin," the *Book of Rites* a "Village Yin," and the *Discourses of the States* states: "When a guest from a rival state arrives, the Gate Yin announces it." Thus, gate chiefs, village chiefs, and pass chiefs were all called "Yin." Since Xi was chief of the passes, he was able to welcome and await Lord Lao.

Yet the *Rites of Zhou* specifies that the pass chief held only the rank of senior officer, not grandee. Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: "Yin Xi of the Pass was a grandee of Zhou, skilled in esoteric learning." The *Inner Transmission* says he "excelled in celestial divination and esoteric prognostication." The *Rites of Zhou* lists the *Fengxiangshi* (Astronomer) and *Baozhangshi* (Astrologer), both middle officers, as responsible for celestial observations, while only the Grand Scribe, a junior grandee, oversaw celestial and climatic matters. Since Xi was skilled in astronomy and held the rank of grandee, he may have been Zhou’s Grand Scribe. While at court, he likely held a grandee’s post, and when dispatched, he assumed the duties of a senior officer. Knowing Lord Lao would arrive at the pass, he sought appointment as its magistrate to await him.

Today, in the Hearkening Immortal Hamlet of Shenlong Township, Zhengwu County, south of Mount Zhongnan, stand the thatched tower, solemn altar, and shrine halls—his former residence. According to the *Biographies of the Masters of Louguan* and the *Record of Louguan*, he served as a grandee during King Kang’s reign and, by King Zhao’s time, encountered Lord Lao and attained the Dao, thereafter accompanying the cloud chariot westward. Later, King Mu, revering the traces of his predecessors, built a shrine and expanded the abbey. Thus, its stele inscription reads: "Louguan was established by Yin Xi, Chief of the Pass and Grandee of Zhou during King Kang’s reign. He built a thatched tower, hence the name." It also states: "When King Zhao of Zhou made his western inspection and Duke Wen of Qin hunted eastward, both diverted their chariots to pay homage. Emperor Qin Shi Huang built a temple south of the tower, and Emperor Wu of Han established an abbey north of the observatory. Jin and Song offered inscribed tablets, which survive to this day, while the temple households of Qin and Han have continued unbroken."

From this, it is evident that Lord Lao crossed the pass during King Zhao’s reign. Some claim it occurred during the Eastern Zhou, but this stems from later scholars seeing that Lord Lao remained during Confucius’s time and assuming he had not yet departed. They failed to realize that after transforming the Hu, Lord Lao returned to the Central Plains, crossing the pass multiple times.

Yet as no events were recorded, they were omitted. Now, however, this marks the inception of Master Yin’s reception of the Dao, and moreover lays the foundation for the transformation of the Hu, hence it is particularly inscribed here to make it known.

When Yin reached the pass, he declared: “The yang number culminates in nine, the stellar lodges align with Metal, and the seasons and months jointly govern the law. Within ninety days, a great sage shall pass through the capital.” He first instructed the pass officer Sun Jing: “Should anyone of extraordinary appearance and unusual carriage arrive, do not permit them to pass.” Yin then prepared in advance, observing purification rites, and ordered the road swept for forty *li* on either side, with incense burned along the way to await the entry of the Celestial Perfected.

On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the *jiazi* day, an elder indeed arrived—hoary-haired and keen-eared, riding a white carriage drawn by a green ox. The pass officer said: “Your Excellency has given orders; we humbly request a brief delay.” He entered to inform Yin, who exclaimed: “The Dao has come at last! I shall behold the Sage.” Donning his court robes, he went forth to welcome him, prostrating himself and kowtowing, entreating: “May the Heavenly One deign to tarry awhile in his divine carriage.”

The Elder said: “I am but a poor, lowly old man dwelling east of the pass, with fields to the west. I am merely going to gather firewood—why detain me? Pray, let me pass.” This was the first trial.

Yin again bowed deeply, saying: “How could the Heavenly One be gathering firewood? For long have I heard that the Great Sage would come traveling west. Spare your divine carriage from exposure and fatigue; rest awhile.” The Elder replied: “I have heard that in Jambudvīpa there is an Ancient Master, skilled in entering non-action, eternally abiding in continuity. Thus I ascend my carriage and set forth, passing through your pass. Why do you persist in detaining me?” This was the second trial.

Yin continued: “Now beholding the Heavenly One’s sagely countenance, transcendent and peerless, I see the Supreme One of Heaven. How could the frontier barbarians be worth visiting? I beg you not to dissemble; grant me a moment of compassionate instruction.” During the reign of King Cheng, the Elder had once journeyed to Da Qin, Jambudvīpa, and other lands, styling himself the Ancient Master. The *Scripture of Western Ascent* states: “The Elder ascended west, instructing Jambudvīpa. There was an Ancient Master, skilled in entering non-action, without end or beginning, eternally abiding in continuity—thus he ascended and proceeded.” This refers to the Dao itself.

Master Chongxuan said: “Jambudvīpa lies west of Kunlun, north of the Red River, and is endowed with the qi of pure harmony, naturally bestowing longevity. Yet they had not grasped the essentials of the Dao’s origin or the practice of refinement, so the Elder once ascended to the western extremity to transform and guide them.” When the Elder first crossed Hangu Pass, wishing to test the Pass Master, he first called himself a poor, lowly old man. Yet the Pass Master, recognizing him as the Great Sage, insisted on detaining him. The Elder then claimed to be going to instruct Jambudvīpa, to ascend and proceed to the Ancient Master. But the Pass Master declared him the Supreme One of Heaven, asking how the frontier barbarians could be worth visiting—this is the purport of the first chapter of the *Scripture of Western Ascent*. Whenever a former sage transforms others, they first undergo trials. Having passed all three trials, the Elder then revealed the truth to him: “The Ancient Master is none other than myself. Having transformed Jambudvīpa, I shall now return my spirit to the Nameless, eternally abiding in continuity.” This is the purport of the final chapter of the *Scripture of Western Ascent*.

The Elder asked: “How did you recognize me?” This was the third trial. Yin replied: “Last winter, in the tenth month, the Star of Heavenly Principle moved westward past *Pi*. Within the Dipper are four stars of Heavenly Principle, governing the regulation of all things, where the Elder resides. Thus the *Rhapsody on the Sagely Virtue of the Primal Origin* states: ‘Now shining in the *Gouchen*, now concealing its light in Heavenly Principle.’ *Pi* is the stellar lodge of the true west. From the first day of this month, the harmonizing wind has blown thrice, and an azure qi resembling dragons and serpents has crossed westward—this is the sign of a great sage.”

Yin had long studied the *Book of Changes*, apocryphal texts, and celestial patterns. All his observations, whether gazing upward or examining below, had never failed to prove true, so he knew a sage would cross the pass. Day and night, he meditated without cease. Now, with cause, he had indeed encountered the immortal carriage. He entreated: “Grant me compassionate instruction, to deliver those sunk in darkness.”

Having passed all three trials, the Elder smiled contentedly and said: “Excellent, your recognition of me! I, too, have known you. You possess the vision of spiritual penetration and shall attain deliverance from the world.” Overjoyed, Yin prostrated himself, kowtowing, and asked: “May I inquire the Great Sage’s surname and given name?” The Elder replied: “My surname and given name are vast and distant, spanning kalpas without end—impossible to recount fully. Now I am surnamed Li, named Boyang, and styled Lao Dan.”

Thereupon, Yin led him to the official residence, prepared a seat for his veneration, offered ablutions and grooming, and performed the rites of a disciple. Master Yongli remarked: “Behold Laozi and Yin Xi—did they not awaken to the subtle signs beforehand? Yet they still maintained such humble demeanor, wishing to instruct the world.”

The Elder’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had long been in his service, agreeing to a daily wage of a hundred coins. By the time they reached the pass, the debt amounted to seven million three hundred thousand coins. Seeing the Elder departing far from office, Xu Jia hastened to demand payment. The Elder said: “I intend to journey to the Western Sea, Da Qin, Tiaozhi, Jambudvīpa, Anxi, and other lands. If you drive my carriage, I shall repay you in gold upon our return.” Xu Jia agreed. Upon reaching the Pass Master, they fed the green ox in the wilds.

The Elder, wishing to test him, transformed an auspicious herb into a beautiful woman, who approached the oxherd and flirted with Xu Jia. Enchanted, he wished to stay, thus breaking their prior agreement. He then went to the Pass Master to sue the Elder for his wages. The Elder said to Xu Jia: “You have followed me for over two hundred years. You should have died long ago. I gave you the *Tai Xuan Yang Sheng Fu*, by which you have endured to this day. Why do you not recall this and sue me?” As he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth—its cinnabar script as fresh as new—and Xu Jia instantly became a pile of white bones.

Moved by pity for Xu Jia’s death against his true will, Xi knelt and kowtowed to plead for his life, wishing to pardon his offense and restore him to life, and offering to pay the debt on his behalf. The Elder, valuing Xi’s compassionate generosity, said: “Good.” He then cast the *Tai Xuan Yang Sheng Fu* again upon Xu Jia, who instantly revived.

The Elder said: “I do not blame you. You broke our original agreement, and the Dao naturally departed from you—thus you died. Now I shall repay you.” Xi then gave the money to Xu Jia and sent him off with propriety. Xu Jia begged to stay, but the Elder refused. Prostrating himself and striking his cheeks, Xu Jia said: “Having bathed in the sagely grace of your lenient pardon, my scattered bones now see the light again. I shall carve this into my heart and bones, and wish to follow your cloud-borne carriage.” The Elder still refused.

The Elder kept Xi at the Pass for over a hundred days. Xi purified himself, kowtowed twice, and knelt to plead: “A humble child of the dust, I have fortunately encountered a sage. I offer my body and life, and wish to hear the great Dao.”

The Elder said: “Subtle indeed is your question. The great Dao holds to the Three Grades of Authenticity as its rule, taking Oneness as its measure and rectitude as its virtue.”

Xi said: “If the grades of the Dao are three, can one still ascend as an immortal?”

The Elder said: “If you can know the One, all things are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the inner chamber, and refine gold to consume the Black—this is the first step. If you can know this and hold fast without losing it…”

Xi leapt with joy and kowtowed, saying: “How does one refine gold?”

The Elder said: “It is a divine method. From the Most True Supreme Lord down, none have attained the Dao except by the Golden Elixir. Treading the Nine Darks and entering the Profound Void, ascending and descending through emptiness, they rise together with the divine luminaries.”

Xi again kowtowed and said: “I wish to hear its essentials.”

The Elder said:
*“Red cinnabar and black mercury form the great elixir’s head,
From red to black is true cultivation.
Extract essence from the red, marrow from the black,
Resolve the red and black—peerless medicine.
Use red to enter black to preserve long life,
Use black to enter red to become a celestial immortal.”*

Xi said: “The Dao is lofty and wondrous indeed. I have not yet studied or mastered it—pray grant me further instruction.”

The Elder said: “The first is lead, and lead is the lord. The second is mercury, and mercury is the minister. If the lead is not true, the mercury will not draw near. If the lead is true, it will not lose its household ministers. The Azure-Waisted Messenger and the Crimson-Blood General unite the two clans, disparate kin dwelling as one. White mercury becomes the brain, yellow sprouts the root. Transform lead into powder, refine mercury into dust. Yin resides in the yang position, yang numbers balance yin. The moon waxes and the sun wanes, cold and heat divide their realms. Open and establish the symbolic forms—brilliant patterns emerge. Only this Dao of mine endures with heaven and earth.”

Xi bowed and said: “I reverently receive your command regarding the essentials of the medicines. But what of the furnace and crucible’s design, the timing of water and fire?”

The Elder sang:
*“Round as three-five, a tenth of an inch,
Mouth four-eight, lips two inches,
Two feet long, thickness even,
Belly three navels, seated warmth descending.
Yin above, yang rushing below,
Head and tail martial, center civil.
Begin at seventy, end at thirty,
Within a hundred, harmonize well.
Yin fire white, yellow sprouts the root,
Coming and going, never leaving the door.
Gradually growing great, nature and temperament pure,
Return to the One, restore the origin.
When one cycle completes, be most diligent,
Guard closely, do not grow confused.
The path is distant, profoundly mysterious—
If you attain this, you will fathom heaven and earth.
At midnight and noon, purify soul and spirit,
Gain long life, enter the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao, seek its patterns,
Ponder deeply—no need for debate.”*

He sang again:
*“Sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth,
The hexagrams revolve in clear cycles.
Three-five before, three-five after,
Five-six thirty, returning to life.
Life and death cycle through twelve,
Twelve divided into twenty-four.
Twenty-four qi mutually shift,
All phenomena, every ounce, lie herein.
One taste of mercury splits into two,
Transforming yin and yang into *ji* and *wei*.
*Ji* and *wei* then pair as husband and wife,
Only then does one perceive heaven and earth within the crucible.”*

He sang once more:
*“The Golden Liquid Returned Elixir flows with immortal splendor,
Soaring high on clouds, ascending to the celestial mounds.
Red and yellow substances form in an instant,
At that time, male and female pearls scatter in profusion.
They can transform and summon traveling kitchens,
Divine youths and jade maidens accompany me.
Entering and exiting without barrier, in harmony with heaven,
Their essence congeals like frost, adept at sinking and floating.
If you reverently follow this, you will surely journey there—
The secrets of the Golden Liquid end here.”*

“When the elixir is complete, fashion gold into eating vessels—this too can grant long life. First test the gold; only when it is formed may you consume it. Thus it is said: the Golden Elixir can be made, and the world can be delivered.”

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Tai Qing Eight Talismans Scripture*, the *Tai Qing Observing Heaven Scripture*, the *Nine Capitals Scripture*, the *Divine Elixir Scripture*, the *Golden Liquid Scripture*, and the methods for the Eight Refinements, Nine Cycles, Returned Elixir, and Fire-Taming.

The Elder again said: “If you truly desire to become a divine immortal, first consume the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid. If you cannot consume the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid, your suffering will be in vain. You will be bound by wind, cold, rain, damp, and demonic darkness, and the Registrar of Destinies will be unable to save you. Can you not strive? Diligently refine the elixir, guard yourself early, and do not show it to fools, lest they slander and defame the divine Dao, increasing your transgressions. Alas! A walking corpse, though rich with all things under heaven, though noble as a king or marquis, will not fill a hundred years before becoming a basket of earth—how lamentable! To compound the divine elixir is but a moment’s toil. Once achieved, you become an immortal, equal with heaven, freely following your heart’s desires. What boundless joy!”

Xi said: “Refining gold and consuming the Black—are these two different paths?”

The Elder said: “They are the essence of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang—they are called the Two Qi. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the liquid of wood and the essence of metal—when the Two Qi meet and unite, this is called the Outer Elixir. Holding harmony and refining the storehouse, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending to the Cinnabar Field, circulating without cease, morning at the Crimson Palace, gathering from the Five Stones to nourish the hundred spirits—this is the Inner Elixir.”

Holding harmony and refining qi—those who cultivate the Dao and attain the Inner Elixir may prolong their years, while those who attain the Outer Elixir may ascend to heaven. The Three Ones and Nine Contemplations are the essentials of inner cultivation; the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquid are the ultimate of the Outer Elixir. To practice both together is the decisive path to Daoist attainment.

The Han Celestial Master composed the *Preface to the Scripture of the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir*, which briefly states: The subtleties of the immortal’s pursuit, the wondrous words of the profound, the supreme principle beyond all principles, the great reality that is yet not reality—these have already been fully expounded in the profound tradition, not to be confined by even the slightest partiality.

Laozi said: This is also to expound the record of the empty and tranquil Dao. Its manifestations of numinous virtue, the causes of its arising, the establishment of scriptures and teachings, the recording of extraordinary accounts—all these weave together the great Dao, dissecting the Three Ultimates. First, the great clarity discerns the inverse and the direct; then, all is swept away in the forgetting of dualities. All are called possessors of virtue, yet they are unified in non-dependence. In their comings and goings, none perceive their origin; in the daily use of the hundred clans, they ever excel without knowing why. This is the power by which the Dao reveals itself in clarity and becomes the bridge for the myriad things.

As for the Dao, as for its virtue—tracing the lineage to its source, exhausting the wondrous to its limit, gathering all branches to the true root, converging the ten thousand strands into one essential—it flows ceaselessly without end. As for the work of the Golden Elixir, its numinous depths are lofty, its dark transformations profound. The dragon’s metamorphosis shines with spirit; what was withered and cut off revives, and those who grasp the qi of life know no decay. Ascending the radiant Han to soar beyond, roaming the cloud peaks in freedom—until the face radiates jade light, the body grows wondrous fur, water is spat and fire exhaled, flight is effortless, forms divide into ten thousand changes, and all is done at will. Rivers and mountains are dammed without embankments, peaks and ridges are split without axes or awls. Its numinosity is hard to record, its wonders impossible to lose. Vast is the essence of the numinous—it cannot be fully described.

Xi again inquired: “I have received your teaching on the method of refining gold. May I now ask about consuming the Black?”

The Elder said: “Consuming the Black is the firming of essence. Receive the *Mysterious Scripture of Radiance*; the essential wonders of the life-generating Dao emerge from darkness and enter the hidden. Above, secure the Gate of Clouds; below, fortify the Numinous Root. To know it is very easy; to practice it is very difficult. When the body moves, virtue scatters; when qi strays, the Dao rebels. Essence dissipates, the hun-soul is harmed; when the eyes stir, the po-soul is disordered. Thus the sage stills the body and secures the qi, accumulates essence and restrains vision—then virtue and Dao congeal in emptiness, the hun and po are firmly guarded, the body is one and the spirit ten thousand, and the Dao is accomplished.

“Regularly, after midnight, lie supine with fists clenched, inhale the pure Black through the nose, and slowly exhale through the mouth. Then guard the Three Ones, enter the chamber, and engage in the Nine Contemplations. When the spirit is settled and the Black is at peace, the Dao of immortality is near.” Thereupon he transmitted to Xi the *Central Scripture of the Jade Calendar* in thirty-five chapters.

Xi said: “I beg you to instruct me on the purport of the Three Ones.”

The Elder said: “The Dao of the Three Ones is what immortals hold most sacred. The world has never heard of it—you must keep it secret. Between the eyebrows, one inch inward is the Hall of Light; two inches inward is the Cavern Chamber; three inches inward is the Mud Pill Palace—this is the Upper Elixir Field, wherein dwells the Red Child, named Yuanxian, called Imperial Minister. The heart is the Crimson Palace, the Middle Elixir Field, wherein dwells the Perfected One, named Zidan, called Radiant Firmness. Three inches inward from the navel is the Gate of Life, the Lower Elixir Field, wherein dwells the Infant, named Yuanyang, called Mysterious Valley. Each is three inches in length, all clad in red silk, red robes, and red shoes—these are the Three Ones. Another version says the upper wears purple, the middle red, and the lower yellow, all in the form of infants. Below each sits a golden forest and jade table, and always with a golden furnace and jade spoon they stir the essence to nourish the Upper One and Middle One. Day and night, you must visualize this. If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. If you can guard the One, the One will also guard you. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into the Infant, the Infant into the Perfected One, and the Perfected One then into the Red Child—this is the true One.”

He further said: “False paths nurture the body; the true Dao nurtures the spirit. When spirit is true, the Dao is penetrated—one can vanish or abide, the spirit can make the body fly or even move mountains. When the body becomes ashes and dust, how can it be recognized? The ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are the faults that linger for you. The nose and mouth, their beloved fragrances and flavors—these are your foes. The body is the root of affliction—pain, itching, cold, and heat. The mind is the burden of the body—sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation. If you do not swiftly cast these aside, your will and qi will daily diminish, your lifespan will not extend—this has been the case for a long time. You must first diminish all desires, not let the mind wander, dwell in quietude, and meditate in a purified chamber. Ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar scriptures are not equal to guarding the One. Always take emptiness as your body, non-being as your mind. The body of no-body, the mind of no-mind—this is called guarding the spirit. Guarding the spirit, the mysterious is penetrated—this is called the Dao’s sameness.

“It is like lofty mountains and great marshes—they do not desire insects, fish, birds, or beasts, yet insects, fish, birds, and beasts gather to them. If one can be empty and non-active, not desiring to practice the Dao, the Dao will naturally come to them.” I have seen this in the *Scripture of Western Marvels*.

Thereupon he transmitted to Xi the method of the Nine Refinements of the Golden True Yang, called the Nine Chambers of Contemplation: First, the Contemplation of No Deviant Thoughts; second, the Contemplation of Upright Body; third, the Contemplation of Attaining Rectitude; fourth, the Contemplation of Great Rectitude; fifth, the Contemplation of Utmost Rectitude; sixth, the Contemplation of Body Rectitude; seventh, the Contemplation of True Rectitude; eighth, the Contemplation of Penetrating the Mysterious; ninth, the Contemplation of the Great Mystery. Entering these nine chambers and practicing these nine contemplations, one unites in form with the Great Yang and together attains the Dao.

Xi received all these secrets, bowed twice, and touched his forehead to the ground in reverence, cherishing the profound purport.

Discourse says: The sage’s words are most concise; the primordial principle is not complex. What is recounted above consists of the words with which Lord Lao responded to Guan Yin’s repeated earnest requests—collected in their essentials to instruct later generations. This was no conversation of a single morning or evening.

Xi then resolutely resigned from office. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he respectfully invited Lord Lao to his home. Another day, he entreated, saying: "This foolish one knows not what to ask—pray grant further instruction."

Lord Lao replied: "If you wish to cultivate the body and nurture nature, to practice the Dao and discipline form, to refine qi and perfect spirit, and to attain boundless continuity, nothing precedes stillness. Thus, heaven is still to establish constancy, spirit is still to enact transformation, and man is still to sustain life. When about to enter stillness, turn inward in reflection, let the mind harbor no reckless thoughts, the mouth utter no reckless words, the form make no reckless movements. The formless takes form before you; the soundless becomes audible; the tasteless turns sweet; the wordless becomes teaching. Divine radiance descends; fortune and virtue draw near; harmonious qi responds. If you wish to still the spirit, first bathe and fast for twenty-five days, then refine your body until the hun and po are at peace—only then may you enter the chamber. Once inside, should a cinnabar serpent alight upon your heart, or the Queen Mother descend, or a Dao-body manifest, know that these are but the spirits within your body testing you. Do not be startled or afraid; if questioned, do not answer; if harmed or offended, do not fear. Simply compose your mind and settle your intent, and the apparition will depart of itself.

After twenty-five, forty-five, sixty, eighty-five, one hundred and five, one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and fifty, and one hundred and eighty days, spirits will come—all to test you. Remain composed and do not respond; they cannot harm you. If you succumb to fear, the trial will be failed, and the Dao lost. Beware and take heed.

After one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will brighten of itself, and matters of safety and peril, life and death, will all be foreknown. The palaces within your body will each become clearly visible. After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses will be dispelled. After one year, scars will vanish. After a thousand days, form and spirit will both attain subtlety, and you will become a Perfected One."

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Wondrous Perfection*, the *Inner Explication*, the Three Caverns’ True Scriptures of *Great Clarity* and *Highest Clarity*, the talismans and diagrams of *Numinous Treasure*, and the methods of *Great Mystery*, charging him to teach them to the most refined and benevolent, that they might ascend as feathered transcendents and ensure the lineage would not be severed. Xi bowed his head in reverence and gave thanks.

Lord Lao then said to Xi: "I tell you again: the ancient masters were none other than my own manifestations. I once transformed in the land of Jambudvīpa, and now I shall return my spirit to the Nameless, abiding ceaselessly as if present. Now I depart, returning to the One Origin."

As Lord Lao prepared to journey west, Xi kowtowed and begged to accompany him. Lord Lao replied: "I roam beyond heaven and earth, play within the dark mystery, traverse the four bounds and eight extremities, above and below without limit. How could you follow me?"

Xi said: "I would enter fire or the abyss, descend into the earth or ascend to heaven, reduce my body to ashes and forfeit my life—all to follow the Great Immortal."

Lord Lao said: "Those who attain the Dao can see with penetrating vision and hear with penetrating clarity; their transformations are unfathomable, their concealment and manifestation indeterminate. Even they cannot follow me afar. Though your bone-configuration accords with the Dao and you are destined to achieve perfection, you have received the Dao but recently and have not yet attained spiritual communion. How could you transform and follow my sacred body?"

Xi bowed again and said: "May I hear of the Way of spiritual communion and transformation?"

Lord Lao replied: "The qi of the living and the forms of existence are all illusions. That from which creation begins, that which yin and yang transform, is called life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and master change, to shift and alter form, is called transformation and illusion. The Creator’s craft is wondrous, its work profound—thus it is difficult to exhaust or end. The craft of the formed is manifest, its work shallow—thus it arises and perishes in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation do not differ from life and death may you be spoken to of the Way of transformation. If you can diligently cultivate this Way and embody spontaneity, then I may journey with you to transform the kingdoms."

Twenty-eight days later, Xi again burned incense, bowed twice, and entreated: "I have been fortunate to hear the supreme Dao, my joy beyond words. Pray bestow a written work to expound the Dao’s purport and instruct later generations."

Lord Lao said: "Very well. You shall be the leader of all Perfected Ones and, in this land of Wanli beyond the world of the abandoned worthy, transmit and propagate the Great Dao." Thereupon, he bestowed the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*, saying: "I have never lightly bestowed this text upon others. Only once in a thousand years is it transmitted. Strive diligently." Xi received it with joy, held it fast, recited it, and practiced it. The Dao was accomplished, and he transmitted it to later disciples.

According to Liu Xiang’s *Seven Summaries*, when Liu Xiang collated the *Laozi* in the palace library, there were two chapters in the *Laozi* and one chapter in the Grand Scribe’s version. Minister Xiang’s version had two chapters, while the combined internal and external texts comprised five chapters and one hundred forty-two sections. After removing three duplicate chapters and sixty-two sections, he established two chapters and eighty-one sections. The first chapter, the *Dao Classic*, contained thirty-seven sections; the second, the *Virtue Classic*, contained forty-four. This was the original arrangement of the chapters after initial collation, though it is unknown which passages were removed or where the divisions were made. Both the palace text and Xiang’s text refer to two chapters, suggesting a fixed version existed before collation. Later traditions hold that the *Laozi* has eighty-one chapters, corresponding to the supreme number of the Great Yang. The *Dao Classic* is placed above to model heaven, and heaven’s number is odd, hence thirty-seven chapters. The *Virtue Classic* is placed below to model earth, and earth’s number is even, hence forty-four chapters. Yet Ge Hong and others did not alter this original arrangement, instead appending the chapter "The Dao Constantly Does Nothing" to the end of the *Virtue Classic*, stating: "Heaven is completed by the four seasons, hence the upper classic has four nines—thirty-six chapters. Earth is completed by the five phases, hence the lower classic has five nines—forty-five chapters. Together, they correspond to the number nine times nine."

Strictly following the guidelines and maintaining consistency with the previous translation:

---

Yan Junping thus stated: "The Way of Yin is eight, the Way of Yang is nine; combining eight with nine yields seventy-two chapters—forty in the upper section and thirty-two in the lower." Yet his chapter divisions entirely diverge from those of Heshang Gong. This arrangement, too, originates with Junping and lacks any basis. Now, examining the various versions, some present the text as continuous prose, while others divide it into eighty-one chapters, akin to the stanzas of ancient poetry, each marked separately. Such segmentation, however, burdens the text with redundancy, and thus the chosen divisions are clear without requiring each chapter to be titled.

Carefully considering *Liezi*, which cites "The Valley Spirit never dies" and attributes it to *The Book of the Yellow Emperor*, we see that the five thousand characters may derive from an older text. Thus, when *Laozi* states, "What the ancients called 'the crooked shall be whole,'" it is no empty saying—this is its meaning. Hence Confucius, lamenting "transmission, not innovation," and "trusting and loving the ancients," sighed in emulation of Lao Peng.

Examining other texts that quote *Laozi*, some refer to it as the *Mysterious Classic*, while Han Fei’s *Illustrations of Laozi* diverges slightly from the currently circulating version. Such variations are no more surprising than the differing recensions of *The Analects* (Qi and Lu versions) or *The Book of Documents* (ancient and modern texts)—differing accounts are to be expected.

During the Tang, Fu Yi collated numerous versions and tallied their characters, noting: The "Concubine of Xiang Yu" version, discovered when a tomb of Xiang Yu’s concubine was opened in Pengcheng during the fifth year of Qi Wuping, was said to be the "Gazing Toward Anqiu" text. In the Taihe era of the Wei, Daoist Kou Qianzhi obtained the "Master of the Riverbank" version. The family-transmitted version of the Qi recluse Qiu Yue contained 5,722 characters, aligning with Han Fei’s *Illustrations of Laozi*. Additionally, an official version from Luoyang had 5,635 characters; Wang Bi’s version had 5,683 (or 5,610) characters; and Heshang Gong’s version had 5,555 (or 5,590) characters. The commentaries of various schools also vary in length. Yet, as the years passed, each tradition held fast to its transmission, sometimes cross-referencing other versions, resulting in discrepancies.

Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian* states: "Laozi composed a book expounding the meaning of the Dao and virtue, totaling over five thousand words." Since it does not exceed six thousand, "over five thousand" is accurate. Today, Daoist tradition refers to it as the *Five Thousand Character Text*, merely citing a round number.

Lu Xisheng’s *Commentary on the Dao and Virtue Classic* states: "When the Great Dao was obscured and worldly teachings declined, the realm descended into chaos. At such times, Heaven’s bell summoned the sage, who, grieving that the people had strayed from governance, arose to support the declining and rescue the chaotic. The late Zhou was such an era. Thus, Confucius elucidated the culture of the Three Dynasties to uphold its decline, while Laozi grounded himself in the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to remedy its chaos—their aims were one. Confucius’ flourishing arose from culture, and culture delights the emotions. Laozi’s flourishing stemmed from simplicity, and simplicity restores nature. The extremes of nature and emotion are not distinct to the sage. The alternation of culture and simplicity is immutable across the ages.

*The Book of Changes* states, 'Manifesting through benevolence'—this refers to teaching through culture. Cultural teaching makes matters evident, and when matters are evident, refined speech is detailed. *The Book of Changes* also states, 'Concealing through application'—this refers to teaching through simplicity. Simplicity’s teaching is subtle, and subtlety is unfathomable; thus, those who fabricate interpretations abound.

Laozi’s flourishing takes the Dao as its essence and names as its function, embodying 'non-action yet nothing left undone,' aligning with the august ultimate. Yang Zhu adhered to Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou misunderstood Laozi’s function and overreached, striving to 'abolish sageliness and discard wisdom.' Shen Buhai and Han Fei misapplied Laozi’s names, leading to oppressive and harsh governance. Wang Bi and He Yan misconstrued Laozi’s Dao, drifting into emptiness and reckless abandon. These six figures are all transgressors against Laozi. Yet the world, deeming Laozi’s principles incompatible with Confucius’, slanders his name by claiming he 'denigrates benevolence and righteousness' and 'abolishes ritual and learning,' or faults his Dao as 'solely relying on purity and emptiness, unfit for governance.' Alas, the world’s delusion runs deep! This has led to Laozi being maligned for a thousand years, his Dao and virtue unfulfilled in his time—rightly so.

Laozi traces the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounts the changes of past and present, first clarifying the Dao and virtue, then expounding benevolence and righteousness, and finally exposing the failures of ritual and learning and the excesses of punishments and warfare—his words arise from the gradual governance of the world. His grasp of essentials and adherence to fundamentals lie in the extremes of nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with the self and mind, takes form in the family and state, and culminates in the world—so comprehensive is it. Yet the deluded still speak thus—is this not a grave slander?

Fu Xi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi preceded Heaven and Earth, grounded himself in yin and yang, deduced the principles of nature and destiny, and explored the mysteries of the Dao and virtue—his origins are the same as Fu Xi’s. King Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the Great Change, valuing firmness and esteeming transformation, yet centering on the mean. Laozi examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the Great Change, embodying softness and guarding stillness, yet unifying them in the great—his lineage aligns with King Wen’s. Confucius traced the legacy of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Kings Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teachings of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi emulated Fu Xi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and enveloped the world with the transformation of the Dao and virtue—his authority converges with Confucius’. These three noble ones are the pinnacle of sages, yet Laozi transformed and penetrated them, returning to unite with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the essence of ultimate subtlety—this is what is called the utmost spirit."

Yet Wang Bi held that the sage embodies the Dao, while Laozi had not yet fully embodied it—thus Ruan Ji deemed him a "superior worthy, second only to the sage." This aligns with Fu Si’s view. Could it be that Laozi’s traces of worldly engagement fell short of his own teachings? Such is not the case.

Alas! The sage’s presence in the world follows two paths: one of active advancement, the other of reclusive withdrawal. When the Dao goes unenacted, some risk their lives in ceaseless travel, bearing the world’s sorrows as their own; others conceal their names, drifting like fleeing birds, showing the world it cannot entangle them. Though their ways diverge—one boundless, the other confined—they converge at the same destination. This is the true gate of Dao and virtue, not mere opposition.

Thus, Confucius’ emergence and Laozi’s abiding, Laozi’s silence and Confucius’ speech—these are the utmost expressions of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could those two scholars have grasped this? Sima Qian, in compiling the lineages of all schools, placed the *Dao De Jing* at the forefront—truly discerning root and branch. Yet Ban Gu, in his *Table of Ancient and Modern Personages*, disparaged Laozi by ranking him in the third grade. Though his name may be disparaged, can his Dao be denigrated?

Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and marveled at his Dao, saying, "It is like the dragon!" He sought his instruction on ritual, and indeed, no question remained. Later records and traditions failed to plumb its meaning, giving rise to a profusion of heterodox interpretations. For those who transmitted it did not exhaust its source, and thus those who expounded it did not fulfill its essence.

Ah! Had such a transmission not been composed, Laozi’s intent might have nearly vanished. Now, therefore, I have exhaustively traced its subtleties, making it resplendently harmonize with the intentions of all the sagely ones. One who embodies the Great Dao and employs its name, wielding antiquity to govern the present, will bring order as easily as turning a palm.

Of those who have spoken in Laozi’s defense, only the Grand Historian came close. As for governance, only Emperor Wen of Han attained a fraction of his Dao. All other perverse and distorted accounts are unworthy of consideration.

The

The honored position of Supreme Perfected is conferred upon him, along with a purple hibiscus crown, a fluttering azure feathered skirt, vermilion undergarments with green sleeves, a rainbow-hued sash, and a nine-colored tasseled jade tablet. Fifty golden lads and fifty jade maidens are granted to his service, placing him above the Twenty-Four Heavenly Kings, where he oversees eighty thousand immortals.

Xi prostrated himself in reverence, saying: "This humble dust-born child, having encountered the Great Sage, has been granted flesh upon withered bones—a thousand lifetimes of fortune. To serve as a sweeper in your abode or as an attendant on your journeys would be my deepest wish and greatest honor. Yet this exalted rank, these lavish rites—what virtue do I possess to dare accept them?"

The Lord Lao replied: "You have long yearned for the Dao, your hidden virtue has ascended to be heard, and your diligent cultivation has fulfilled its profound work. This is no favor I bestow upon you alone; press onward with resolve."

Xi, unable to decline further, bowed twice and accepted the mandate. From then on, he soared through the void, attending the Dragon Chariot and roaming the eight directions.

Thereupon, the Lord Lao expounded the *Scripture of Primordial Yang* to the Sacred Mother of the Grand Bureau. Her entire household—over two hundred kin—ascended to heaven in a single ascent. The Lord Lao, recognizing the family’s generations of accumulated merit, raised them to the heavens in accordance with celestial decree, manifesting his transformation within their home.

In Chengdu Prefecture, the Green Ram Palace remains, along with the sites of the Descent Birth Terrace and the Primordial Yang Terrace. Yue Penggui, Hanlin Academician and Drafter of Edicts, composed its summary, saying:

Of the eighty-one heavens, they span half the lifespan of the Most High. Six million years mark the dawn of the Primordial Beginning. The Dao, vast and boundless, defies comprehension; its essence, subtle and formless, eludes inquiry. It dwells beyond form and void, before the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity. Two spirits emerged together, carving open creation; three qi intermingled and advanced, scattering the unhewn into embryonic form. Dark and yellow flowed yet uncoagulated; pure and turbid divided and congealed. The Dao is the ancestor of the ten thousand qi; virtue is the root of the ten thousand things.

It is also said: His body rides the chariot of power, wheels turning beyond the primordial chaos; his hand wields the handle of longevity, directing all before the unfolding of creation. Serene and without action, he abides in effortless contentment. By transforming what is untransformed, the ten thousand things are perfected; by generating what is ungenerated, all living beings attain fulfillment.

Again, it is said: When the hidden depths first opened, the ninefold brilliance steamed without cease; when the Great Primordial unfolded, the six voids flowed without rest. He established the undivided teaching, revered the true and singular origin. First, he wandered in the Azure Epoch, and when the Azure Epoch ended, he later emerged in the Crimson Clarity, which in turn passed away. Ninety-nine myriad billion years are stored in a pellet of cinnabar; the five thousand five hundred layered heavens lie hidden within a cicada’s shell.

At the height of King Gaozong of Yin’s reign and the inception of King Wen of Zhou’s *Book of Changes*, divine radiance infused the jade womb, auspicious qi coalesced into golden bones. Unhewn and unadorned, he gestated for over eighty years; descending in splendor, his birth surpassed twenty thousand days. His feet tread the principle of imperishability; his hands grasp the scripture of eternal life. Gazing down upon the ford of the Qi River, he surveys the era after the primordial chaos. Adapting to circumstances, he established teachings as the model for all ages; responding to change without constraint, he became the paradigm for a hundred kings.

Thus, the Great Dao is the crown of the Three Teachings, and supreme virtue is the ancestral origin of all rulers.

The Green Ram Market, according to the annals, is where the Most High, the Celestial Sovereign of Primordial Mystery, descended a second time. After the Yin Dao declined and the Zhou virtue waned, he traversed the mortal realm with historians, abandoned his post as Archivist, and withdrew into seclusion. Leaving the Wei Gate behind, he crossed the Han Pass to the west, riding a carriage drawn by a green ox, its wheels turning gracefully, and a brush pulled by a white phoenix, soaring freely. Xu Jia held the reins, accompanying the former emperor; Yin Xi divined the winds, knowing the Dao Lord would arrive once more. Though briefly parted, three thousand years had passed since he last appeared as the Crimson Youth; reunited, eight hundred years of life remained in the company of the Yellow and the Old. Secretly, he transmitted the wondrous formulas; subtly, he imparted the esoteric words. A thousand days were renewed in promise, and a single moment of reunion was sealed anew.

Briefly ascending to the Primordial Beginning, he then ascended to the Heaven within Heaven, eternally serving the ancestral master and returning to the image beyond images. Thus he exhorted the Azure Emperor’s Azure Dragon, transforming into the Green Ram in Shu Commandery; riding the purple clouds to the Purple Palace, descending the purple qi upon the royal chambers. The ceaseless sound was about to pause, yet the infant’s milk had yet to come. Suddenly, joy arrived, and the wailing child fell silent. From the body of a crimson infant, he reverted to a white-haired elder, and so on.

Inscribed thus:
At the vast origin’s first unfolding, kalpas stretched boundless.
In the dim and distant, the Great Dao; in the subtle and serene, the image of the Emperor.
The Grand Inception could conceal, the Grand Commencement followed.
Within the dark and yellow shell, clear and turbid had not yet shed.
Before heaven and earth, myriad eons passed.
Teachings were set forth according to the moment, responding to change without hindrance.
The Three Sovereigns grew ever clearer, the Five Emperors ever wiser.
All under heaven knew peace, all living beings were delivered.
The Louguan Temple set the course, the Han Pass bore the inscription.
As guest, he expounded the transformation; in India, he spread his benevolence.
The form beyond form, the sound beyond sound.
Departing, none could send him off; arriving, none could welcome him.
Forced to name the name, forced to call the call:
Above the Great Void, gold forms the city.
Within the boundless darkness, white jade forms the capital.
Resplendent beyond limit, embracing the eight directions.
All nations drink as one, all rivers pour as one.
None can exhaust it, none can fill it.
Those who tread the shallow path dwell long in prosperity and integrity.
Those who tread the deep path attain eternal Great Peace.

It is also said:
He carved open heaven and earth, shaped and refined the primordial chaos,
grasped the sun and moon, enveloped the cosmos.
All phenomena were exhausted, only the Dao endured alone.
Amid the three teachings’ contention, only the Dao stood supreme.

In the ninth month of the fourth year of Zhonghe during the Tang Dynasty, a stele was erected at Qingyang Palace by the Jiedushi of Xichuan, which remains extant today.

*End of Scroll Three of The Sacred Records of the Primordial One*

*Scroll Four of The Sacred Records of the Primordial One*
Compiled by Song Dynasty Master of Observing the Return, the High Scholar Xie Shoubin

The Lord Lao said to Perfected Yin: "You once wished to follow me on a distant journey. Now that your Dao is accomplished, you may tour beyond the eight directions." Thereupon, he exhaled the hidden texts of the eight directions and bestowed them upon him.

Overjoyed, Yin received them and immediately summoned the cloud chariot of the Eight Effulgences. The Lord Lao mounted the chariot, drawn by five-colored divine dragons, bearing the vermilion celestial standard of the Flowing Radiance Yellow Heaven, shaded by the nine-light crane canopy. Twelve guardian officials led the way, divine soldiers wielding banners, while ninety thousand flying immortals followed, controlling the whirlwind wheels. Lions cleared the path, phoenixes flanked the carriage, and they soared through the void. The Perfected One accompanied the Four Heavenly Kings.

They arrived at the Mountain of the Sun’s Cavern and Eternal Brightness, where they grasped the cinnabar branches of Fusang, scattered the vermilion blossoms of Ruomu, gazed upon the Azure Sea, embraced the Eastern Well, passed the Jade Pool Palace, and were received by the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, and the assembled immortals, who offered cinnabar fruits and golden nectar of jade-green ale.

Next, they ascended Ancestral Mountain, beheld the Mushroom Fields, gathered spirit-nourishing herbs, and rested at Penglai Palace. They then journeyed south to Phoenix Mountain, ascended Green Mound, passed Purple Mansion, where the Lady of Great Primordial and the Master of Purple Mansion presented the nine-light sweet dew, the White Essence of King Wen, and the Azure Grove’s White Seeds. This mountain, also called Xiao Mound, yields the nine-light magic mushrooms and the cloth of the Fire Court.

They ascended Longli Mountain, crossed the Crimson Ford, and entered the Great Cinnabar Palace, where the Lady of the Southern Culmen served jasper blossoms, jade wine, and the fiery dates of Red Spirit. Arriving at Crimson Mountain, they observed the Land of Flowing Fire, rested at the Scarlet Mound’s gate, and were offered by the Duke of Great Harmony and Jade Perfection the cinnabar marrow of Flame Ridge, flying elixirs, purple peaches, and the nectar of Lei Mai.

They then traveled west to Tortoise Terrace, entered the Seven Treasures Garden, and beheld the Flying Mystery Purple Script. Passing the Flowing Essence Gate, the Primordial Sovereign of Grand Simplicity, the Golden Mother of the Nine Numina, presented dates inscribed with jade script, their fruits like vases, and commanded her attendants to offer the returning-soul incense, the dark-light azure peaches, and the intertwined golden-purple dates. Next, they crossed the Weak Waters, ascended Phoenix Mountain, embraced the Jade Pool, rested at Kunwu Mountain, where the White Emperor Heavenly Lord presented the seven-famed stone mushrooms, flowing essence jade ointment, and golden-light elixir.

Journeying north to Kongtong Mountain, they passed the Cavern of Shade Palace, where the Perfected Lord of the Northern Culmen offered the thousand-knot divine herbs and the void melons of the Black Cloud Plum. These melons ripen once every four kalpas. Ascending Dark Mound, they observed the Eight Refining Pools of Northern Darkness, rested at the Vast Cold Ruins, and were served by the Immortal Earl of Great Mystery the cinnabar fruits of the Crimson Tree and the three-mystery purple nectar.

They then ascended the Central Marchmount, Kunlun Mountain—this is not the Five Marchmounts of the human realm, but the divine mountain upon the sea. The Eastern Marchmount is called Broad Mulberry, the Southern Marchmount Longli, the Western Marchmount Lovely Agriculture, the Northern Marchmount Vast Wilds, and the Central Marchmount Kunlun.

They toured the Jasper Terrace of the Dark Garden, entered the Hall of Hearing the Wind, beheld the Seven Treasures’ Jasper Grove, listened to the nine-plumed singing phoenix, gazed upon the sun, moon, and stars in radiant exchange, and looked down upon the Four Heavens as if upon their palms. There stood golden terraces and jade towers, palaces of seven treasures, luminous day and night, the abode of the Heavenly Emperor and divine kings. Each face had one hundred and forty gates, with forests of pearls and seven treasures, purple blossoms and cinnabar fruits, jasper leaves and jade flowers. Lutes and zithers harmonized, all attuned to the pitch pipes. The Perfected Ones of the Nine Chambers of Great Mystery dwelled there. All was the natural celestial kitchen; ingress and egress were at will. The heavenly retinue was exquisite beyond compare, the music beyond description—truly the Pure Capital of the cosmos, the grand spectacle of divine perfected beings.

Yin the Perfected, having first received the office of Youthful Perfection, accompanied the Lord Lao on this journey through the five sacred mountains of the mortal realm, the grotto-heavens and palaces, and the watery abodes of the four seas and rivers. Their lords were sometimes called Sacred Emperors, sometimes Perfected Kings, sometimes Dukes or Marquises. In their consultations, they often discussed the Two Modes and Three Radiances, the yin-yang qi and seasons, the length and brevity of kalpas, the rise and fall of emperors’ fates, the fortunes and misfortunes of the people, the ranks and demotions of those who cultivate the Dao and ascend as immortals, the methods of harmonizing the black sequence and averting the Yang’s ninety-six calamitous conjunctions, or the profound principles of the Dao’s origin, its virtue, and the subtleties of the formless and soundless. The Lord Lao answered all as requested, his words arcane and unfathomable.

It was during this western journey to Tortoise Terrace that he expounded *The Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* to the Queen Mother of the West. Ge the Immortal Elder said: "I once received it from the Lord Emperor of the Eastern Culmen, who received it from the Lord Emperor of the Golden Gate, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother transmitted it orally, without written record. Now I inscribe and record it for the world."

The Lord Lao said to Yin: "I shall now ascend with you to the Jade Dawn to pay court and tour the imperial homeland." As he spoke, the numinous sounds of the Eight Assemblies arose, clouds and darkness gathered on all sides, and they slowly ascended into the void. They traversed the Nine Heavens, where the Lords of the Heavens all came to welcome the Lord Lao. He entered their palaces, where jasper blossoms, jade fruits, moon nectar, cloud wine, and spirit mushrooms were arrayed, their radiance illuminating the seats. Heavenly music resounded in grand assembly, the divine songs surpassing all description. The Perfected Emperors of the Heavens all bowed in reverence and inquired of the natural, supreme, mysterious, and perfect Way of the Primordial One. Thereafter, the Great Perfected of the Upper Prime, the Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate of the Middle Prime, and the Immortal Earl of the Great Clarity of the Lower Prime arrived, riding cloud chariots of azure haze and yellow essence, drawn by azure rainbows, qilin, and lions. They unfurled canopies of intertwining radiance, phoenixes, and flying cranes, bearing the banners of the Sun Essence and the Perfected Mandate, the standards of the Moon Radiance and the Demon Subduers, and the flags of the Star Light and the Immortal Mandate. Divine immortals and numinous officials attended them.

The assembly numbered one hundred fifty thousand—seventy thousand from the Upper Prime, fifty thousand from the Middle Prime, and thirty thousand from the Lower Prime—each descending in hierarchical order with their cloud chariots, canopies, ornaments, banners, and standards. Bearing incense and flowers, they floated through the void to arrive, prostrating and bowing in welcome as the Lord Lao ascended to the Vermilion City of the Sun Gate and the Jeweled Palace of Elixir Pearls in the Upper Clarity. There, the Lord Lao commanded them to pay homage to the Most High Jade Dawn, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao.

Then the Dao Lord bestowed upon them twelve treasures: the Ring of Joy’s Unyielding Elixir Fruit, the Hidden Dragon Lingzhi, the Jeweled Bloom Jade Nectar, and nine other divine gifts. Thereafter, following the Lord Lao, they descended to the numinous mountains of Tianshui, proceeding onward to the Western Regions. This is the present-day Mount Qiling in Qinzhou. There stand the Terrace of Western Ascension and the Hall of the Sacred Countenance, both situated beneath the cliffs.

Earlier, when the Lord Lao departed the Zhou, he journeyed west to transform the lands of Da Qin, Anxi, Yuezhi, Wuge, and Tianzhu, where he was known as the Ancient Master. The kings and peoples of those realms embraced his teachings, cultivating goodness, softening their fierce and unruly customs, and exalting the virtues of courtesy and deference. Did he then return to the Middle Kingdom? According to the *Tang Comprehensive Institutions*, Da Qin—also called Lixuan or Fulin—lies forty thousand *li* from Chang’an. Its land is level and vast, comprising over four hundred cities, with dozens of smaller states paying tribute. Its people are tall and resemble those of the Middle Kingdom. Their ruler is not hereditary; rather, the worthy are chosen by consensus. The Lord Lao had long since enlightened these lands, though the world remained unaware, and thus no records survive. Only now, with the Perfected Master Yin’s mission of transformation, have accounts of these events spread to the Middle Kingdom.

Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: “The Lord Lao cultivated essence and qi, dwelling in Zhou for many years before departing for Da Qin.” The *Biography of Perfected Master Yin* recounts: “Only when Yin accompanied Laozi across the Flowing Sands did they journey together.” Ge Hong’s *Preface to the Elixirs* notes: “In my youth, I wished to travel to Fulin to witness the customs of the lands beyond the seas. I heard that the people of Da Qin revered the Dao, living in purity and harmony, their laws just and upright. Merchants from the Middle Kingdom were called ‘men of Zhou.’” During the Tang, envoys from Da Qin came to court, wearing crowns and silk robes. They paid homage before the image of the Lord Lao, donated funds to restore a Daoist abbey, and copied the Emperor Minghuang’s annotated *Daode Jing* and *Huangdi’s Classic of the Hidden Talisman* to take back to their land—further proof that the Lord Lao once visited their realm.

Now, accompanied by the Supreme Perfected Master Yin Xi, he once more journeyed to Khotan to spread the teachings, briefly resting in the mountains and valleys near the outskirts. The king of the Pure Harmony realm was originally the Celestial Elder of the Eastern Ultimate, who in a former life ascended to become the King of Wondrous Brahmā. Whenever the Lord Lao passed through his domain, the king would bow from afar and vow: “May the Compassionate One deliver this disciple. In future lives, may I always serve as your disciple and attain the rank of a lofty Perfected.” Later, though he exhausted his celestial blessings and was reborn among mortals, residual merit allowed him to become a ruler of the Qiang and Hu peoples—namely, King Fan Tuo of Khotan.

Once born into the human realm, he forgot his past lives and indulged in boundless slaughter, frequently setting out on hunting expeditions. Unwilling to forsake his earlier vow, the Lord Lao descended to instruct him. As the king was hunting in the mountains, a five-colored radiance pierced the sun. Marveling at the sight, he followed it and encountered the Lord Lao. The king asked, “Who are you, sir?”

The Lord Lao replied, “I am a cultivator of the Dao.”

The Perfected, who penetrate the profound and fathom the subtle, comprehend all celestial and terrestrial tongues, as well as the speech of foreign lands and even the sounds of other beings. Thus, when conversing with the Hu king, the Lord Lao spoke in the language of his realm. The attendant Perfected, however, recorded the exchange in the proper script, which later circulated in the Middle Kingdom as the *Scripture of Transforming the Barbarians*. This is akin to a man of Qi who, though able to speak like a man of Chu, would naturally use the southern dialect when addressing a Chu native—yet when committing the conversation to writing, would revert to the language of Qi. The same hand records both, requiring no translation.

The king asked, “What is this thing called the Dao? Truly, explain it to me.”

Lord Lao said: “The Dao is the primordial darkness of emptiness and nothingness, the undifferentiated spontaneity of the primordial chaos. It has no exterior, no interior, no high, no low. Heaven and earth arise from it, and the myriad things take form through it. It cannot be named, so we force a designation and call it the Dao.”

The king said: “Since I established this kingdom, I have never heard of such matters. From whence have you come to dwell here?”

Lord Lao said: “I am the numinous root of the ten thousand qi, the primordial origin of the Way of divine transcendents. In heaven, I am revered by all the sages; on earth, I am the teacher and lord of the ten thousand states. Above and below heaven, all are my officials. My spirit revolves without limit, and my transformative power shapes the cosmos. I distribute the sun and moon, the constellations and the void. I pace the heavens and measure the earth, composing scriptures and texts. Heaven and earth, the myriad things—all are bound to the Lord of the Dao by fate. All that has form arises from the Dao.

I am born from the formless, grow in the nameless. I descend as the teacher of emperors, following the world’s transformations to instruct it. Now I have come from Zhou.”

Knowing the king to be stubborn and coarse, difficult to transform, and unversed in humble speech, Lord Lao spoke plainly to him, hoping to awaken him to his past causes.

The king said: “I wonder what methods you used to teach people in that land.”

Lord Lao said: “In the Middle Kingdom, I always used the Daoist methods to enlighten them.”

The king said: “What are Daoist methods?”

Lord Lao said: “Daoist methods are the Supreme Numinous Treasure, born before heaven and earth. Vast, it encompasses all; subtle, it embraces all. Without it, heaven cannot shine, earth cannot take form, spirits cannot enter the unseen, and humans cannot live or grow. Thus, the teeming myriad things take the Dao as their root. The snake that attains it becomes a dragon; the bird, a phoenix; the beast, a qilin; the ordinary person, a transcendent.

Those who cultivate it wander freely in the great void, transform their five viscera, alter their appearance, command ghosts and spirits, and conceal or reveal themselves at will—this is the Way of the highest transcendents.”

The king said: “What you call the Numinous Treasure is indeed rare, but my wisdom and strength are shallow and weak. I am unequal to such matters. I wonder what method would be suitable for teaching in this kingdom.”

Lord Lao said: “Observing the customs of your kingdom, I see that the people harbor perversity and rebellion. They slaughter one another, cruelly harming all living things. Lustful and greedy, they daily commit evil deeds, bringing about their own downfall. If you wish to live a full lifespan and die without misfortune, you should practice the method of the *Futu* (Buddha).

It cuts away inner and outer defilements without harming the body, hence it is called *Futu*.”

The king said: “What is this method?”

Lord Lao said: “First, abandon the self and others, and cease the boiling and killing. All living things, however dull, love their bodies and lives. Now, you, O king, are fond of hunting and kill without measure. The Way of Heaven loves life and deeply abhors killing and harm. If you wish to preserve your lifespan, I hope you will cease hunting.”

The king’s countenance changed, and he said: “How strange! Are you trying to disrupt our customs, criticize my hunting, and forbid me from killing? Since I established this kingdom, generation after generation has hunted, and we have still preserved our heavenly years. If you have any needs, I will send supplies. Do not speak such words to confuse my people and make them abandon their livelihoods.” With that, he galloped away.

Later, while hunting, he again came to Mount Qu and once more encountered Lord Lao. He asked: “What crime is there in killing that you forbid my hunting? When the body dies and becomes empty, what retribution will there be?”

Lord Lao said: “Your fondness for hunting disregards the four seasons and fails to avoid the breeding and nurturing of life. How can this not be a violation of Heaven and a cruelty to creatures? By law, it should cut short your blessings and diminish your lifespan. Heaven has spirits who oversee killing and record human transgressions. When your life ends one day, the earthly officials will seize your hun soul and confine it, subjecting it to interrogation and suffering, forever consigning it to the prisons of sin.”

The king said: “Apart from killing, are there other benevolent transgressions?”

Lord Lao said: “The sin of killing is the gravest. Accumulated grievances become karma, and in the five destinies and four modes of birth, the retribution never ceases. Arrogance, violence, indulgence in wine and lust, greed, deceit, and belief in demonic sorcerers—all these are also sins. After death, one enters hell, and the hun soul suffers torment. If you wish to reform and believe in the *Futu*, in life you will enjoy wealth, honor, health, and peace; in death, your hun soul will not be bound, and your joy will be boundless. Is this not good?”

The king said: “Very good. Please explain it to me in detail.”

Lord Lao said: “The *Futu* shaves off hair and beard, wears faded robes, bares one shoulder, and walks barefoot to restrain the body. It upholds precepts to cease evil, eats at midday and repents of past wrongs, and constantly practices cessation and contemplation to discipline the mind. Those who cultivate it may, at best, preserve their bodies and protect the state; at least, they may avoid the苦 realms.”

The king said: “It is good, but my wisdom and understanding are shallow, and my habits are long-ingrained. I cannot uphold precepts, practice cessation and contemplation, nor wear coarse robes and walk barefoot. However, the affairs of the state and the army are weighty, and I still hope for blessings. Might I first practice midday eating, gradually reduce killing and hunting, and thereby transform my people? Would that be acceptable?”

Lord Lao said: “... It is acceptable.”

The king said: “I do not yet understand the method. Please instruct me.”

Wishing to transform the kingdom and make all believe and turn toward the Way, Lord Lao said to the king: “Today, I will prepare a midday meal for you. I hope you will lead your ministers and the common people to come and partake, so that they may observe the method.”

The king said: “However divine you may be, how can you provide for the multitudes of my kingdom?”

Lord Lao said: “I hope you will deign to lead the people here. Do not worry.”

The king then returned to his kingdom and set a date for the gathering. Lord Lao scattered the five clouds in the valleys of the five directions. According to their directional colors, they transformed into palaces, adorned with curtains and canopies. Hundreds of millions of flying transcendents became attendants, and the heavenly kitchens provided countless delicacies.

The king secretly sent men to observe, and when they saw this, they were greatly astonished. The entire kingdom then came to the gathering. After seven days, the assembly dispersed, and Lord Lao bestowed upon the king and his ministers and people all manner of rare treasures and silken fabrics.

The king addressed Lord Lao, saying: “We have witnessed the rites and rituals. We wish to prepare a midday feast and hope to lead our followers to attend.”

Lord Lao replied: “My followers are quite numerous. I fear you may not be able to provide for them.”

The king, astonished, said: “I rule a great kingdom, possessing all things. How could we fail to provide? Let us set a date for the gathering.”

Lord Lao then said to True Man Yin Xi: “The Hu are stubborn and unyielding, their hearts still unrepentant. We may use this gathering to transform them with skillful means.” He then summoned all the transcendents from across the land to attend the assembly. Those who came filled the roads without cease for over a month.

The king’s granaries and treasuries were nearly exhausted before the feast was even half complete, and he began to regret his decision. Summoning his ministers, he plotted: “Why are these Daoist followers so numerous? I prepared this midday feast to benefit the kingdom, yet now they drain my granaries. I fear this is a scheme by neighboring enemies, sending them to harm our land. If not, they must be demonic spirits. If we do not act swiftly, our kingdom will suffer greater ruin. You must burn and kill them at once to preserve our land.”

Thereupon, the Hu amassed firewood in the outer suburbs, their smoke and flames blotting out the sky. They surrounded Lord Lao and his attending transcendents with troops, driving them into the fire. Lord Lao and the transcendents entered the flames with serene composure, appearing and vanishing amidst the smoke, their forms growing ever more radiant.

The king then ordered them cast into the depths of the abyss. As Lord Lao entered the water, the waves surged, and his body emitted a brilliant light. Enraged, the king ordered great cauldrons heated to boil them. Lord Lao calmly entered the seething broth, laughing and conversing as if at ease.

The Hu king, now alarmed, realized they could not be killed. Yet, having already committed such acts, he was ashamed at his failure and hastily dispatched messengers to neighboring kingdoms: “A demonic spirit, sometimes old, sometimes young, ever-changing in form, dwells in the mountains and valleys of my land. I cast it into fire and water, yet it cannot be slain. I fear it will bring greater harm to your kingdoms. I urge you to swiftly raise your armies and join me in exterminating it.”

Within ten days, the Hu forces assembled, surrounding Lord Lao. Drums and horns resounded, bows were drawn, swords unsheathed, and the encirclement closed on all sides. Yet Lord Lao remained at ease within the siege, untroubled and without anger.

Suddenly, wind and thunder converged from all directions, the earth trembled, and the Hu soldiers’ arrows and stones turned back upon them. Spears and halberds shattered, armor and shields fell silent. Terrified, the Hu forces scattered in panic.

The Hu king trembled and addressed his people: “How do we know these elders are not great sages? Now I wish to serve them. What say you?”

The Hu replied: “Great King, since fire, water, boiling, and arrows could not harm them, are they not sages? But we fear their accumulated wrath may yet destroy our kingdom. We urge you to act swiftly.”

The king said: “Indeed. I shall go before them myself, bound and prostrate, to beg for mercy and forgiveness.” Thereupon, he bound himself and knelt before Lord Lao, pressing his forehead to the ground a thousand times, pleading for pardon.

At that moment, Lord Lao, wishing to strengthen their faith, declared: “I am the Most High Lord Lao, born before the limitless, having endured kalpas as numerous as grains of sand. I have delivered countless beings, presiding over the thirty-six heavens, governing the three realms, and commanding all spirits. Retribution for sin and fortune alike proceed from me. I came to transform you out of pity for your transgressions. Yet you, relying on your wealth and pride, refused to comply. You invited me to a midday feast only to humiliate me. Your accumulated evil clings to you—what use is regret now? The divine soldiers of heaven were poised to destroy your kingdom and eradicate your people.”

Before he finished speaking, the Hu king and his followers beheld celestial warriors, divine kings, and armored soldiers beyond count, riding dragons and tigers through the air, their angry voices shaking the earth. The king and his people, terrified and wailing, pressed their foreheads to the ground until they bled, prostrating themselves and pleading: “We were born in the borderlands, wild and foolish by nature, disbelieving in the Dao and its laws, and insulting the Heavenly Venerable. We weigh our crimes and know that even a thousand deaths would be too light a punishment. The annihilation of our entire kingdom would not suffice to repay our debt. We beg only for forgiveness and the gift of life. We vow to uphold your teachings without regret until death, dedicating our kingdom to your service without cease.”

Lord Lao said: “Enough, enough. Even with your foreheads bloodied from kowtowing, I cannot yet be assured. I fear you may yet repent. What pledge can you offer as oath?”

The king replied: “If the Heavenly Venerable and Great Sage deign to pardon our sins and grant us a new beginning, we vow that all men and women of our kingdom shall never marry nor take spouses, shaving their heads and beards to serve your teachings. If we violate this oath, let our deaths stand as witness.”

Lord Lao said: “Very well. Your oath is weighty, and I am moved to pity. Yet your cruelty has endured so long that I have little cause to spare you. To destroy your kingdom and reduce it to dust, sinking it ten thousand fathoms into the earth, would be as effortless as flicking a finger. But I cherish life, so I pardon you. You must adhere strictly to my precepts and never betray them again.”

The king bowed and said: “We reverently accept your command.”

Thereupon, the divine soldiers vanished, and heaven and earth returned to tranquility. Lord Lao then instructed the king: “Now that I have released you from your sins, you must uphold the Buddha’s teachings to enjoy eternal blessings and ever dwell in the human realm.”

The king and his people, filled with awe and joy, pressed their faces to the ground, palms joined in reverence and gratitude. Lord Lao then cast his merciful and benevolent light upon the king’s body. Suddenly, the king recalled his past causes, awakened with remorse, and wept bitterly, tears streaming down his face. He bowed twice, kowtowing, and said: “From kalpas without number, my evil roots have never been severed. Though I have been reborn, I soon fall again, rising and sinking like a bucket in a well. Had I not encountered the Heavenly Venerable’s great compassion, moved by my karmic connections to grant me deliverance, I would have forever languished in the evil destinies without hope of escape. Now I vow to abandon my kingdom and enter the mountains to uphold the Great Precepts, atoning for my people’s sins and praying for their blessings. I hope to be delivered from the world and forever escape the wheel of rebirth.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Excellent. If you wish to dwell in the mountains and study the Dao, let your wife, children, and ministers decide for themselves whether to stay or go. Those who remain shall uphold the Five Precepts and the Ten Good Deeds, while those who follow you into the mountains shall observe the Six Precepts.”

The king replied: “Indeed, this is my sincere wish.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “If you truly desire to hear the Dharma, you must purify yourselves and observe the fast. When the fast is complete, gather together, and I shall transmit the teachings to you.”

The king bowed in gratitude and withdrew. He then relinquished his throne, passing it to his son, and led from his kingdom twelve thousand five hundred men and women—ministers and commoners who had awakened good hearts—to arrive together. They prostrated themselves, kneeling long in reverence to await instruction.

The Perfected Lord Yin, having just returned from partaking in the celestial feast of the Heavenly Emperor, descended with a halo of radiant light crowning his head and lotus blossoms beneath his feet. Accompanied by jade lads and jade maidens, celestial musicians, and clouds of fragrant flowers, he descended from the heavens.

The Heavenly Venerable pointed to the Perfected Lord Yin and said to the Hu king: “This is my disciple, the Supreme Perfected Lord, whom I appoint as your master.”

He then instructed the king and the assembled multitude to first repent the transgressions of their three karmic actions and six senses—all hidden sins and manifest faults, the ten evils and five rebellions, and all misdeeds arising from adherence to heterodox views—committed since time without beginning, as well as the karmic offenses accumulated by their parents and kin across past lives. When their repentance was complete, he said:

“Now, each of you, compose your thoughts and calm your spirits. Listen carefully to my words, for today I shall transmit to you the Five Precepts and the Ten Good Deeds.

The Five Precepts are: first, do not kill; second, do not consume intoxicants; third, do not steal; fourth, do not engage in illicit sexual conduct; fifth, do not speak falsely. Those who uphold these precepts shall be guarded by twenty-five precept spirits.

The Ten Good Deeds are: first, filial piety; second, loyalty; third, compassion; fourth, forbearance; fifth, generosity; sixth, diligence; seventh, offerings; eighth, faith and devotion; ninth, exhortation to virtue; tenth, tranquility and concentration. Those who practice these shall be protected by ten celestial spirits of goodness.”

Having transmitted these, he further expounded to the king and his followers the Ten Precepts, the Eighteen Precepts, the Twenty-Four Precepts, the Two Hundred Fifty Precepts, and the Five Hundred Precepts for Women.

He then instructed them to observe the Three Long Month Fasts in the first, fifth, and ninth months of the year. Additionally, they were to keep the Six Fasts each month on the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth days—known as the Fasts of the Four Heavenly Kings. Furthermore, they were to observe the Ten Straight Fasts each month:

On the first day, invoke the Boundless Great Flower Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Fire Cart Hell.
On the eighth day, invoke the Supreme Jade Dawn Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Dark and Cold Hell.
On the fourteenth day, invoke the Perfected Lord of Transcendent Salvation to escape the sufferings of the Scalding Cauldron Hell.
On the fifteenth day, invoke the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Wind and Thunder Hell.
On the eighteenth day, invoke the Heavenly Venerable of Life-Sustaining Salvation to escape the sufferings of the Bronze Pillar Hell.
On the twenty-third day, invoke the Mysterious Perfected Heavenly Venerable of Myriad Blessings to escape the sufferings of the Fire Screen Hell.
On the twenty-fourth day, invoke the Supreme Numinous Void Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Dismemberment Hell.
On the twenty-eighth day, invoke the Supreme Wondrous Ultimate Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Diamond Hell.
On the twenty-ninth day, invoke the Perfected August Cavern Spirit Heavenly Venerable to escape the sufferings of the Universal Torment Hell.
On the thirtieth day, invoke the Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Venerable to escape the karmic retributions of the Three Realms.

On these days, the heavens of the ten directions descend to observe the good and evil of humanity. One should fast for a day and a night, abstaining from all but plain food, and recite scriptures to escape the sufferings of the Nine Hells and the karmic retributions of the Three Realms. Those unable to fast may consume the flesh of animals that have died of natural causes.”

Then, addressing the four assemblies, he said: “The king has now received deliverance. I shall proceed to transform other kingdoms.”

The king again bowed deeply and entreated: “Great Sage Heavenly Venerable, now that you are about to journey afar—a reunion most difficult to attain—our entire kingdom has received your grace, and our longing is boundless. We humbly request that you and our master, along with your disciples, remain to practice the Dao for thirty days before we bid you farewell. We implore your consent.”

The Heavenly Venerable replied: “Very well.”

Thereupon, the king, together with his heir, ministers, and people, established a grand Daoist sanctuary, presenting abundant offerings, hymns, and praises. When the appointed day arrived, though they still wished to detain him, the Perfected Lord said: “Excellent, excellent indeed are your offerings. Yet I must attend my master in transforming other kingdoms and cannot remain.”

Then the Hu king gathered his robes, rose, and advanced on his knees. Bowing deeply, he joined his palms and said: “My master is about to leave me, and I have no further counsel to seek. I beseech you to bestow upon me an essential teaching to uphold for the rest of my life.”

The Perfected Lord said: “I shall tell you: though the precepts are not the ultimate Dao, they are indeed the stepping stones to entering it. If you uphold them steadfastly, supreme tranquility will arise in this life, and wisdom will dawn. A nine-tiered terrace begins with heaps of earth; a tree that embraces a man’s arms grows from a tender shoot; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

He further said: “The customs of your kingdom are fierce and unyielding, and the lingering habits of asura nature remain unremoved. My master’s teachings exalt gentleness and humility, and you must practice non-contention. Thus, none in the world can contend with you. If you can embody non-contention, in this present life you shall be foremost among men, and in future lives you shall attain the fruits of goodness.”

Having received this teaching, the king prostrated himself in gratitude. The Perfected Lord then addressed the king again: “Come forward. Do you know that the form of the body is illusory and that the myriad phenomena are not real? If you seek the joy of quiescent extinction, you must eliminate defilements, cease thoughts, and refrain from perceiving objects of desire. Even a single speck of dust, if clung to, will burden your nature.”

At these words, the king awakened and bowed his head in gratitude, saying: “Indeed, indeed.”

Thereupon, the Perfected Lord, accompanied by the assembled immortals and attendants, followed the Heavenly Venerable out of the borders of Jibin. The entire kingdom’s ministers and people, filled with sorrowful longing, bowed in farewell.

The king then entered the mountains with his followers to cultivate the Dao, instructing one another in turn. The Heavenly Venerable proceeded to the kingdom of Tiaozhi, where the king revered heterodox demonic masters, calling them sages. His disciples, numbering over three thousand, were all supported by the court. For twelve years, they widely practiced sorcery, and the king held them in deep reverence.

One day, the demonic masters said to the king: “There is a great mountain in the kingdom that blocks the path, obstructs the source of streams, and causes floods from time to time. Can you masters remove it?”

The demonic masters replied: “We can. Tomorrow, we shall remove it for the king.”

Just then, the Heavenly Venerable arrived and sat beneath a tree, observing the demonic masters performing their strange arts. They made hand seals, and the mountain trembled slightly.

Perceiving that the king could be converted, the Heavenly Venerable said to Perfected Lord Yin: “The demonic masters are attempting to remove this mountain. If they succeed, the king will believe them to be true sages, and we will no longer be able to convert him.” He then instructed Perfected Lord Yin to restrain the mountain from afar with his spiritual power, and the mountain ceased to move.

The demonic masters said to one another: “Earlier, the mountain moved, but now it does not. Could there be someone with extraordinary arts restraining it?” They hurried to the mountain’s summit and scanned the surroundings. Spotting the Perfected Lord in the distance, they rushed to seize him and brought him before the king.

The king asked: “Who are you?”

The Perfected Lord replied: “A disciple of the Most High.”

The king asked: “Who is the Most High?”

“A sagely being,” he answered.

The king asked: “Where is the Most High now?”

“Having left Jibin to teach the Dao, he is now nearby, beneath the mountain.”

The king immediately ordered his attendants to welcome him. Once the Heavenly Venerable arrived at the palace, the king invited him to sit and asked: “People say the Old Master is a sage. There is a great mountain in my kingdom that obstructs the path and troubles the people. The demonic masters could not remove it. I wish the sage would remove it for me.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Very well.”

The king asked: “How many men will be needed?”

“This is a small matter. Why would men be needed?”

Fearing the king would no longer trust them, the demonic masters sought another chance to remove the mountain themselves.

The king said: “Very well.”

Thereupon, the three thousand demonic masters all performed their arts, exhausting their techniques, but the mountain remained unmoved.

The king said: “Your arts are exhausted. Please, Old Master, remove it.”

The Heavenly Venerable took his nine-jointed staff and swept the mountain away as if it were a clod of earth. The waters flowed smoothly, and the land was level. The king bowed his head in reverence, seeking to become a disciple, and no longer served the demonic masters. The entire kingdom’s ministers and people, filled with awe and admiration, all wished to take refuge and receive the teachings.

The Heavenly Venerable returned to the tree beneath which he had sat. The king invited him to stay in the palace, but he refused. The king’s faith deepened, and he crawled forward on his knees, kowtowing and entreating: “I have heard that sages do not go against the wishes of others. I humbly beg you to expound the wondrous Dao.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “I have heard that true kings are no ordinary men. Their virtue shades all things, their conduct aligns with Heaven and Earth, they enlighten humanity and the heavens, and they rule the kingdom. If the king cultivates the Dao, the land will long endure, armor will be laid aside, weapons stilled, and the people will be at peace. If the Way is absent in the world, the land will collapse, disasters will multiply, and poison will afflict ministers and people. The king should devote himself to serving the Dao and seeking truth. Then he will be free from calamity, his lineage will prosper, neighboring kingdoms will stand in awe, evil will not encroach, his life will be long, and he will stand alongside Heaven. The moon will not suffer nightly eclipses, nor the sun dim by day. Fathers will not mourn their sons, nor ministers betray their lords. The king should embody this and honor the Dao and revere Heaven.”

The king said: “I humbly beg for your compassion, to bestow your teachings and reveal the essentials of the Dao.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “I fear the king may grow arrogant and easily lose heart, so I dare not lightly impart them.”

Thereupon, the king summoned his ministers and the people, and for seven days and nights they performed purification rites and made offerings. Each held colored silks and gold as tokens of their sincerity, bearing incense and flowers, kowtowing a hundred times, and entreating thrice with earnest devotion: “We have heard that the Great Sage enlightened Jibin, and distant and near kingdoms all received the true teachings. We are weak and unworthy, yet to receive your compassion. We beg you to reveal the great Dao, to enlighten our foolish people, that the entire kingdom may follow it for generations.”

Knowing their hearts were sincere, the Heavenly Venerable said: “I have already instructed my disciple, the Perfected Lord of the Supreme, to serve as teacher to the kings of various lands, expounding the scriptures and precepts, purifying the heart and restraining the form, so that in life they may dwell in peace, free from untimely death, and in death attain liberation, not falling into evil destinies. If the king reverently upholds these, he will gain boundless blessings.”

The king said: “Indeed, indeed.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Good. The king may return to the palace, burn incense, and meditate.”

Thereupon, the Perfected Lord manifested a transformation body in the king’s palace hall, seated upon a precious lotus, and bestowed upon the king the Eighteen Precepts. The king rejoiced, joined his palms in reverence, and vowed to abandon his kingdom and worldly attachments, upholding these precepts without fail. The Perfected Lord also expounded the Three Precepts to the king, his ministers, and the people—men and women alike—who had newly awakened, and the Five Precepts to those whose hearts were already subdued.

The king further asked: “The Most High Sage first descended to the East. Did he teach the same Dharma as that which you have now bestowed?”

The Perfected Lord said: “My master adapts his teachings to the world. Long ago in the Divine Continent, he taught the Dao of immortality to enlighten the realm. From the Three Sovereigns to the Five Emperors, all who cultivated it attained immortality.”

The king asked: “What is the difference between the Buddha and the immortals?”

The Perfected Lord said: “The Buddha turns the mind toward the Dao, cutting off the six senses, taking emptiness and quiescence as the essence, and through spiritual awakening of the nature, attains the fruit of Buddhahood. Yet when life ends and form perishes, they ultimately enter quiescence, becoming nothing more than yin spirits. The immortals cultivate truth and realize the Dao, uniting form and spirit in wondrous perfection. They manifest transformations, ascend and descend between being and non-being, and attain eternal life without extinction.”

The Hu king said: “Why not teach this to our foreign lands, that we may share in it?”

The Perfected Lord said: “The Dao of life is most weighty, a secret of Heaven. Without having planted its roots in former lives, how could one easily hear of it?”

The Hu king bowed in gratitude, then built a pure abode and had an image made to honor the Heavenly Venerable. He then accompanied the Perfected Lord to convert other kingdoms, eventually reaching the kingdom of Yutian. The people of Yutian, having heard that the Heavenly Venerable was coming, led the entire kingdom to welcome him at the southern canal mountain, also called Mount Tantai, where they had built a pure abode to invite the Heavenly Venerable to reside.

The Heavenly Venerable resided in quietude, neither eating nor drinking. The king and his ministers sought his counsel morning and evening, entreating him to share his teachings. The Heavenly Venerable instructed them in the methods of fasting and purification.

The king said: “The sagely master speaks only of fasting and purification—are there yet further teachings?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied: “My Dao is boundless, adapting to customs and times, establishing transformations according to the moment. In the Central Lands, I propagate the Supreme Orthodox, Perfect, and Limitless Dao. Those who cultivate it transcend the world and prolong their years; when their practice is complete and merits perfected, they ascend to immortality, riding dragons and driving darkness to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. I expound the thirty-six divisions of the Three Caverns’ true scriptures and the eighteen thousand chapters of the Great Vehicle’s secondary teachings. From emperors to common folk, those who cultivate and uphold them receive rewards and ascend as immortals according to their depth of practice—some become supreme sages, others attain lofty perfection. Their ranks, noble or humble, number thirty-seven grades, and they soar freely, their transformations unfathomable.

There are also the ways of refining golden elixirs and divine cinnabar, the secrets of exhaling and inhaling, swallowing radiance, and nurturing the darkness; the methods of softening the body and harmonizing the spirit, guiding and pulling; the scriptures of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the arts of refining and controlling; and the formulas for ingesting divine mushrooms, sacred herbs, malleable gold, flowing water, and jade. As for concealing the heavens and hiding the moon, transforming one’s radiance and refining one’s form, commanding ghosts and spirits, controlling heaven and earth, talismanic charts and precious registers, jade seals and golden writings—myriad scriptures and a thousand canons—all these are used to enlighten later learners. Yet they may only be transmitted to those whose past roots are pure, whose qi is harmonious and unadulterated, who delight in the Dao and rejoice in truth, whose sincerity never wavers, and whose body and mind resonate in accord.

Your people, however, have accumulated lives of rigidity and harshness. It is fitting to temper their bodies and minds with the methods of the Floating Vehicle. If they practice diligently without slackening, after the end of their lives, they will receive blessings and be reborn in heaven.

The Dao’s methods are profound and subtle. Even if I were to teach them to you, they would be difficult to comprehend—not out of my reluctance, but because sentient beings, since time without beginning, have been miserly, greedy, and lustful, insatiable in their consumption, nourishing their pus and blood, deepening their karmic roots. Birth, aging, sickness, and death; noxious winds and poisonous qi; a hundred illnesses assail them. Their rebirths and endowments differ, yet day and night they cycle through ten thousand births and ten thousand deaths. Some remain trapped in the womb, never to be born; others die at the moment of delivery. Some change with every thought at one or two years of age, never knowing a moment’s peace in a single day. This is truly because of their gluttonous consumption of filth, the steaming corruption of flesh and bone, which damages the organs and dissolves even gold and jade, making the body difficult to endure.

I neither eat nor drink, embracing the Dao in its naturalness, transforming without limit, living forever without death. I constantly expound the scriptures and teachings to deliver sentient beings. Yet ordinary people, deluded, cannot believe or apply them. I am ever concerned and grieved for them, and thus I teach them to fast, to lessen their suffering and illness. Those who practice this will obtain boundless blessings.”

The king said: “I have heard of the Buddha, who has recently appeared in Jibin, transmitting the Dharma and delivering people. Is he the sagely master?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied: “This is the teaching of the Floating Vehicle. The kings and peoples of the Western Regions have all taken refuge in it, ceasing to kill and eliminating lust, tempering and softening their natures. They will receive karmic rewards and be reborn constantly among humans and gods. If you now uphold and practice this without slackening, maintaining purity within and without, with a mind illumined and perfectly bright, then sins will not arise, and blessings will naturally grow. Through kalpas without end, you will always know joy.”

The king deeply believed and revered these words, bowing in respect to receive the command.

The *Annals of the Primordial Sage*, Scroll Five, compiled by the Song Dynasty Master of Observing the Return, the Great Master Gao Shi Xie Shouhao.

At this time, the Lord Lao was in the kingdom of Khotan, where he addressed the Perfected Lord Yin, saying: “My transformative teachings have spread throughout these western lands, subduing heterodox doctrines and guiding them to return to the true Dharma. Of all these kingdoms, those already delivered and those not yet delivered—I shall now assemble them all, that they may awaken and enter the Dharma-gate.”

As his words ended, a nine-colored divine radiance illuminated the boundless realms of the West. Wherever the light reached, no distance was too far. In an instant, the city of Vimalakīrti became naturally vast and level, its earth transformed into golden hue. A great Dharma-seat arose, adorned with a hundred treasures. The host of immortals from the Three Realms, the numinous deities of all heavens, assembled together in that moment.

The kings of Khotan, Jibin, Tiaozhi, Anxi, Greater Yuezhi, Zhujuban, Kebantuo, Humiduo, Guduo, Jumi, Xiesu, Xuwuna, Jiuyuejian, Yidan, Wulage, Shifanyan, Hushijian, Hadaluozhi, Persia, Shule, Suiye, Qiuci, Fulin, Yanqi, Gongyue, Seni, Kang, Shi, Cai, Simopan, Cao, He, Greater and Lesser An, Muhu, Wunage, Xunwu, Huoxun, the Western Women’s Kingdom, Daqin, Pāṭaliputra, Dinavuti, Kamaloka, Gandhāra, Udyāna, Dāna, Tamaliṅga, Dulejian, the Arab Empire, Zhifu, Shuman, Damo, Juyao, Cuogu, Jiayemiluo, Jialuo, Bululuo, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kuśinagara, Vaiśālī, Kapilavastu, Śrāvastī, Campā, Samataṭa, Uḍra, Surāṣṭra, Sindhu, Uliśa, Huli, Sekarika, Mansuman, Niba, Yuediyan, Shemi, the Dwarf Kingdom, Xuanqu, Tuoluoyiluo, Langjieluo, Śrāvastī-Magadha, Linni, and Tianzhu—altogether eighty kingdoms.

According to the *Comprehensive Institutions*: The Saka kings resided in Jibin, west of the Congling Mountains. Their tribes dispersed into several kingdoms. From Shule northwestward, the Xiu-tu and Sun-du tribes were all descendants of the Saka. Sun-du refers to the Brahmin kingdom, also called Magadha. The Han called it *Sun-du*, also known as *Shen-du*. Yan Shigu stated: *Shen-du* is Tianzhu (India). The Saka are the Śākya clan, for the barbarian tongue varies in stress. India comprises dozens of separate kingdoms, such as Śrāvastī and Pāṭaliputra. Though each differs slightly, all are called Tianzhu, hence the Five Indias, also known as the Five Lands of India. In addition, the chieftains of the Qiang tribes were too numerous to count.

From afar, they beheld the wondrous and rare radiance, gazing upon it day and night with joy and praise.

Lord Lao, wielding wondrous spiritual powers, gathered them all and brought them before the Way. Seated in repose upon a jeweled throne, Lord Lao was encircled by the barbarian kings, their queens, and retinues, who each burned incense, scattered flowers, and played music as they circumambulated in reverence and made offerings, beseeching to hear the Dharma.

Lord Lao then expounded the scriptures. When he finished, he further instructed them: "You must always take refuge in the Great Dao and have faith in the Buddha."

At that moment, the kings of Śrāvastī, Magadha, and others—*as the* Tongdian *records, Magadha being a vassal state of India, its capital by the Ajitavatī River, with a mountain called Lingnu, known in the barbarian tongue as Gṛdhrakūṭa, for its peak of blue stone resembles a startled crow*—stepped forward, prostrated themselves, and kneeling in the barbarian fashion, inquired: "We venture to ask: in taking refuge in the Great Dao and having faith in the Buddha, how should one cultivate and what reverence should one observe?"

Lord Lao replied: "Excellent question. Those who follow my teachings must establish pure dwellings, maintain solemnity without doubt, burn incense morning and evening, transmit and receive the scriptural teachings, sustain unbroken mindfulness, awaken themselves and others, cultivate fields of merit, hold fasts and lectures to enlighten, draw near to enlightened masters, compassionately guide later learners, renounce worldly entanglements, refrain from boasting of merit, constantly think of aiding others, wish to behold the enlightened age, dispense Dharma and medicine, desire the Way to spread, avoid false gains, shun vainglory, never deceive the lowly, show reverence to all, succor the aged and orphaned, treat near and far with equality, refrain from wanton killing, forever sever all karmic deeds, and ever uphold the harmony of the Dao. Those who can do thus will gain blessings in this life, ascend to heaven in past lives, and bring joy to future generations."

The kings of Śrāvastī, Udyāna, Magadha, and others all vowed to relinquish their thrones and devote themselves to cultivation. The countless assembly, moved by goodness, bowed their heads in assent and received the teachings with faith.

Master Yin, attending Lord Lao, then returned to the Central Lands. The barbarian multitudes, reluctant to part, entreated repeatedly that they remain in their lands to teach and transform beings. The Master replied: "You see me through form, yet I am fundamentally unmoving—how could there be coming or going? If you must see me in bodily form, then fashion images of my likeness with the five colors, earth, wood, metal, jade, and colored stones, and make offerings in reverence. I shall manifest and expound the Dharma for you."

He further instructed them: "You are all born of the same primordial qi of heaven and earth, each endowed with the true and constant nature. In the future, you shall ultimately attain the supreme, perfectly enlightened, and all-knowing Way. Guard yourselves well, transgress no precepts, and eat no food past midday. When rising after a meal, first recite: *Dwelling in the world as in empty space, like a lotus untouched by water, the mind pure and transcendent above all.* Then bow to the supreme honored one, and only then rise."

The entire assembly rejoiced, prostrated themselves, and received the teachings with faith.

At that time, in those lands there were ninety-six kinds of heterodox teachings that deluded the people, yet none could perceive it. Lord Lao transformed them all, guiding them to the true Way. As Lord Lao prepared to return to the Central Lands, he took leave of the barbarian multitudes. Though they clung to him in reluctance, Lord Lao, not wishing to oppose their good intentions, explained: "I shall briefly return to heaven to arrange the records of humans and spirits, then descend again. After a hundred years, I shall send the Buddha to be born in your lands to teach future generations."

Having spoken, Lord Lao mounted his eight-scene cloud chariot, Master Yin rode a white deer, and the host of immortals astride cranes ascended to heaven amid celestial music and divine attendants.

*According to the* Tongdian’s *General Account of the Western Regions... Khotan lies over two hundred li north of the Congling Mountains, nine thousand eight hundred li from Chang’an, with thirty-two thousand households. It is two thousand eight hundred li northeast to the Protectorate’s seat of governance and fifteen hundred li east to Shanshan. East of the Congling, only these two kingdoms are great. From the Later Han through the Wei, Liang, Later Zhou, Sui, and the Zhenguan era of the Tang, they all dispatched envoys to communicate with China. Of the kingdoms west of Shanshan, the people are mostly deep-eyed and high-nosed, but only this kingdom’s appearance does not resemble the barbarians, being rather like that of the Central Lands.*

From the time of Emperor Wu of Han to the present, imperial edicts, decrees, writs, and tally tokens have all been transmitted and passed down in succession, reverently preserved here. Five hundred *li* to the west of the kingdom stands the Vimalakīrti Monastery, said to be where Lord Lao transformed the barbarians. The assembled Hu gazed up in reverence, prostrating themselves with weeping and lamentation. In an instant, all traces of him vanished, and they each returned to their own lands. Only the king of Jibin, Vindāna, entered the mountains to dwell in a monastery, where he accumulated rigorous practice, upheld the precepts with unwavering discipline, and transformed his people, turning them from evil toward goodness. After his death, he ascended to the Brahma Heaven. Once reborn there, he gained knowledge of his past lives and, recalling his former causes, longed to hear the Great Dao. Lord Lao, not refusing his wish, dispatched Perfected Master Yin to descend and bestow upon him the Dao of True Emptiness and Eternal Quiescence, along with the methods of divine transcendence and liberation.

In the *Book of Later Han*, Pei Kai memorialized Emperor Huan, stating: "Your servant has heard that within the palace, shrines to the Yellow and the Old [Dao] and to the Buddha have been established. This Dao is pure and empty, esteeming non-action, cherishing life and abhorring killing, reducing desires and eliminating extravagance. Lord Lao entered the western barbarian lands and first initiated the transformation of the Buddha. The Buddha did not lodge beneath the same mulberry tree for three nights, unwilling to foster long-lasting attachments of affection—such was his utmost refinement. When heavenly spirits sent him beautiful women, the Buddha said, 'These are but leather sacks filled with blood.' And so he did not glance at them. By maintaining such singular focus, he was able to attain the Dao."

Thus it is known that at the founding of the Buddha’s teaching, King Bimbisāra first relinquished his kingdom to enter the mountains for cultivation, and by steadfastly upholding his resolve without breaking the precepts, he was fittingly able in the end to hear the Great Dao and realize Buddhahood.

Emperor Ming of Wei composed the *Hymn to the Scripture of Lord Lao’s Transformation of the Barbarians*:
Before the primal chaos began, Lord Lao was already first,
Existing before the Great Beginning, in the obscurity of primordial darkness.
Without teacher, without ancestor, he was born of spontaneity.
He refined the true and dispersed the uncarved, subtle and mysterious indeed.
Gazing upward to grasp it, it shines resplendent in the celestial heavens;
Looking downward to examine it, it is profound as the abyssal source.
He unfolded the Two Modes to spread transformation,
Illuminated the Three Luminaries to array the heavens.
His nature was without desire, pure and flawless in essence.
His form embraced emptiness and simplicity, wondrous and beyond comprehension.
Stirred, it does not grow turbid; settled, it does not become clear.
Concealed, it is not obscured; revealed, it does not glory.
Who says the heavens are high? Their celestial signs may be marked.
Who says the earth is deep? Its fathomless springs may be dredged.
Yet the Dao—though marked, is not lofty; though dredged, is not profound.
Things receive its form but cannot fathom its source;
Humans are endowed with it but cannot know its entirety.
How splendid is the Dao! It is the ancestor of the myriad things,
The beginning of heaven and earth.
I wish to record it, yet no brush can inscribe it;
I wish to embody it, yet no form can be likened to it.

It further states:
In profound compassion for later generations, he descended in the Chen lineage,
Serving as the Historian of Zhou’s Pillars for nine hundred years.
At the limitless boundary, he returned to Kunlun.
His transformation extended to the barbarian lands, first bestowing teachings upon Shubina,
Then reaching India, whereupon he departed.
His scriptures endure for posterity, everlasting and indestructible.

After Lord Lao transformed the barbarians, he ascended to heaven.
In the fourth year of King Mu’s reign, the jia-shen year, he descended to wander the Eastern Sea,
Reaching Fusang, where he met the Great Emperor and reviewed the ranks of the immortals.
Again, he divided his form to descend upon the Western Sea in the kingdom of King Su-lin,
Where he was titled the Supreme Healing King of Immortal Nectar, the Great Radiant Envoy,
Delivering humans, devas, spirits, and ghosts.
Wherever his teachings had not yet reached, he ensured all beings attained liberation.
Soon after, he ascended to heaven once more.

King Mu, from his youth, was devoted to the Dao of divine transcendents. Moved by his sincerity, the Queen Mother of the West descended to his palace. He also obtained the Eight Steeds, upon which the king rode, with Benrong as his right-hand attendant and Zaofu as his charioteer. Guiding the carriage, they crossed the Weak Waters, where fish and turtles formed a bridge, and thus ascended Mount Chongshan. There, he offered a toast to the Queen Mother at the Jade Pool before returning. He reigned for fifty-four years and lived to the age of one hundred and four.

By this time, Yin Xi had already journeyed to the Flowing Sands. His thatched hut stood on the northern slope of Mount Zhongnan. The king, longing for the sacred traces, commanded his chariot and horses to be prepared. He had an abbey and shrine constructed, and invited Du Wai and six others to become Daoists, serving together in the same rites.

Chong, styled Xuanyi, dwelled in seclusion, chanting and reciting the *Daode*. He constantly guarded the Black Fluid, exhaling and inhaling radiant qi. After more than twenty years, a Perfected suddenly descended to his quiet chamber, accompanied by two attendants bearing a jade casket on either side. Chong bowed in reverence and pleaded, whereupon he was granted a casket containing the *Scripture of the Ninefold Radiance Elixir*. The Perfected said to him: "Lord Lao and Master Wen Shi summoned the Great Emperor at the Eight Halts Mountain in the Eastern Sea to review the ranks of all transcendents. Transcendents from mountain caves and grottoes across the world, no matter how distant, all arrived without fail. At that time, the Earth Controller recommended you for your diligence, and Lord Lao entrusted me to deliver this immortal formula to you." Chong followed the method and ingested it, his body emanating jade-like radiance, his five viscera filled with vitality, his appearance and breath harmonized.

Later, the Perfected Li bestowed upon him the *Supreme Primordial Mysterious and Vast Wondrous Scripture of the Cavernous Void*, which Chong again cultivated, achieving remarkable efficacy. Thus, he untied the knots of his mortal form, preserved his life, and concentrated his true nature. He commanded the hosts of spirits, perceived the mysteries of all things, subdued tigers and leopards, and employed the hundred numina. He traversed the hidden and manifest realms, his depths unfathomable, and lived over a hundred years. In the nineteenth year of King Mu’s reign, the *ji-hai* year, Lord Lao dispatched the Supreme Clarity Primordial Lady to descend and welcome him, bestowing upon him the title of Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and appointing him as the Transcendent King of Mount Wangwu.

Master Wen Shi’s disciple, Mao Gui, styled Gongdu, studied astronomy from a young age and was also versed in apocrypha and weft texts. Wen Shi transmitted to him over a hundred scrolls of Daoist scriptures and elixir formulas, all accompanied by oral instructions. After Wen Shi ascended as a transcendent, Mao Gui practiced alongside the recluse Du Chong at the thatched abbey. At the age of twenty-eight, he ceased grain, practiced qi circulation, and refined divine elixirs. Upon achieving the Dao and ascending, Lord Lao bestowed upon him the title of Perfected of Supreme Harmony and commanded him to descend and govern the celestial bureaucracy at the Du Yang Palace. Gui often traveled, carrying divine elixirs throughout the world to deliver those with karmic affinity. Sometimes he refined gold and silver to relieve the poor, or administered elixirs to rescue those in peril. All who sought his aid received blessings and benefits.

Li Tuo studied the Dao of longevity. During King Mu’s reign, he came to reside beneath Dragon Bridge Peak in Jintang Mountain, Shu, where he compounded the Ninefold Radiance Elixir. After its completion, he wandered the Five Marchmounts, the Ten Caverns, and over two hundred other sites for more than two hundred years. On the Eastern Sea, he encountered the Flying Yang Lord, who transmitted to him the Dao of Water Jade. Returning to this mountain, he refined the medicine to completion, then departed to Dragon Bridge Peak to refine the Golden Crucible Reverted Elixir. By the time the elixir was complete, he had lived eight hundred years. The people of Shu witnessed him across generations, hence he was called Li Eight Hundred. As he had studied the Dao thrice on this mountain, the world named it Three Studies Mountain.

Tuo’s younger sister, named Zhen Duo, followed her brother in cultivating the Dao and dwelled in Mianzhu. Lord Lao and the Three Ancient Masters descended to transmit to her the Dao of ascension. She ascended to heaven in broad daylight before her brother, and thus her mountain was named Zhen Duo’s Transformation—this was the ancient governance of Floating Mountain.

In the twenty-first year of King Li’s reign, the *jia-chen* year, Song Lun of Luoyang took refuge at the thatched abbey. Embracing unity and harmonizing qi, he withdrew from worldly affairs, daily reciting the two chapters of the *Daode* several times. He ingested Solomon’s seal and white wood, practicing thus for over twenty years. One day, Lord Lao descended to his dwelling, accompanied by six transcendents who assisted the Perfected in recording his deeds. Lun prostrated himself in supplication, whereupon Lord Lao said to him: "I possess the Dao of the Middle Effulgence and the Scripture of Communing with the Real, born at the inception of the Three Origins, issuing from the Court of the Nine Mysteries. The Five Powers converge in felicity, the Six Qi congeal in essence. Bearing the Real and preserving the remote, one attains long life and reverts age. If you can cultivate this, you will swiftly ascend upon clouds, exiting the manifest and entering the void, penetrating the obscure and illuminating the bright. The Three Luminaries will shine together, the Two Blacks will unite in numinosity. Transforming at will, you will ascend to Supreme Clarity. Now I bestow this upon you." Lun bowed and received the teaching. Thereupon, the treasure trove was opened, and the *Numinous Flight Six Jia* and cinnabar talismans inscribed on plain silk were delivered to Lun. After cultivating these, he naturally attained spiritual resonance. Six youths constantly attended and welcomed him. He could perceive all within a thousand miles as if by divine sight, traverse cliffs in a single stride, and cross waves and perilous terrain without need of fords or paths. Sometimes he transformed into a white deer, or into a wagtail, soaring over plains and marshes to test the hearts of men. At over ninety years of age, during the reign of King Jing, he was bestowed the title of Perfected of Supreme Clarity and appointed to govern the records of transcendents on the Central Marchmount.

Peng Zong, at the age of twenty, studied the Dao under Du Chong. He received the *Five Thousand Words of the Daode* and practiced the Way of Feminine Unity. He could extend a single breath for three days and three nights, and recite the *Daode Jing* twice in one breath. During King Li’s reign, at the age of one hundred and fifty, Lord Lao summoned him as a Perfected of Supreme Clarity.

During King Xuan’s reign, Feng Chang served as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. At forty, he retired from office to enter the Dao, constantly reciting the *Daode Jing* while dwelling on Mount Zhongnan. Lord Lao dispatched the Perfected Peng Zong, riding a white tiger, to descend to his chamber and bestow upon him the *Supreme Hidden Scripture*. By the time of King Ping, he ascended as a transcendent and became the Perfected of the Western Marchmount.

In the forty-third year of King Xuan’s reign, Lord Lao passed through the Wei River valley. The king went to meet him, whereupon Lord Lao said: "The Year Star has entered the north of Yan—Zhou is in decline." Two years later, King You ascended the throne. Today, beside the Wei River, there is a Boyang River—this is the place.

At that time, woodcutters in the outskirts sang as they worked:
*"With golden kerchief, enter Heaven’s Gate,
Call the Long Essence, gather the Dark Spring,
Sound the Celestial Drum, nurture the Muddy Pellet."*
None of the people understood, but Lord Lao said: "These are words of those who preserve the land—its meaning is profound. This is the practice of the Supreme Perfect Dao."

In the second year of King You’s reign, the earth quaked in the Western Zhou, and the Jing, Wei, and Luo rivers all trembled. Lord Lao said: "Zhou is about to perish. The qi of Heaven and Earth does not lose its order; if it loses its order, it is because the people have thrown it into chaos. Yang lies hidden and cannot emerge; yin presses down and cannot steam upward—thus the earth quakes. Now the Three Rivers have truly shaken, for yang has lost its place and been buried by yin. Yang lost and submerged in yin, the sources must become blocked; when sources are blocked, the state must perish. Water and soil nourish the people’s livelihood, but if the soil has no nourishment, the people lack resources—how can Zhou not fall? In ancient times, the Luo dried up and Xia perished; the Yellow River dried up and Shang perished. Now Zhou’s virtue resembles the final years of those two dynasties. Its rivers and sources will again be blocked, and blockage must lead to exhaustion. A state must rely on mountains and rivers—when mountains collapse and rivers dry up, these are omens of ruin. When rivers dry up, mountains must collapse. If Zhou is to fall, it will be within ten years, for this is the reckoning of fate."

That very year, the Three Rivers ran dry, and Mount Qi crumbled. In the third year, King You favored Bao Si. Lord Lao said: "Zhou is doomed." In the decline of Xia, two dragons halted in the palace courtyard and spoke: *"We are the two lords of Bao."* Thereupon, offerings were spread and divination performed. The oracle declared that the dragons’ glory would depart but remain as a relic, so it was sealed in a casket and stored. Through three dynasties, none dared open it, until King Li broke the seal and beheld it. The dragon’s saliva transformed into a glowing lizard, which a young concubine encountered, conceiving a daughter. Fearing the omen, she abandoned the child. During King Xuan’s reign, a rhyme spread: *"A coiled bow, a winnowing basket—truly Zhou’s ruin."* The king heard of a couple selling such items and ordered their arrest and execution. Fearing for their lives, they fled by night and heard the abandoned girl wailing by the road. Moved by pity, they took her in and fled to Bao. A man of Bao, guilty of a crime, offered the girl to the king as restitution—this was Bao Si. The king adored her, and she bore him Bo Fu. He named Bo Fu heir, deposing Queen Shen and the crown prince, Yijiu.

Lord Lao said: "The disaster is complete—nothing can be done." Soon after, Zhou was destroyed by the Quan Rong.

In the thirty-third year of King Ping’s reign, Lord Lao once more emerged from the Pass to transform the various states, then journeyed to the Western Sea, reaching the isles of Liu and Lin. There, he summoned over eighty thousand immortals from the ten directions—including those newly attained to the Dao who governed the underworld, wandering transcendents, and those who had undergone trials of utmost filial piety and loyalty—and reviewed their merits and conduct. He conferred upon them immortal ranks in five grades and immortal offices in twenty-seven ranks, bestowing them according to their attainment, before ascending once more to Heaven.

Lord Lao had parted ways with the Hu barbarians for over a century when King Bintu, once a vassal of the King of the Western Hu, was reborn in the land of Jambudvīpa as a prince—this was the founder of the Buddha’s teaching. In truth, on the ninth year of King Zhuang’s reign, the night of the seventh day of the fourth month in the *guisi* year, he was born from the right flank of Lady Māyā. The fourth month of Zhou corresponds to the present second month. The Buddhist *Sutra of Past and Present* states he was born on the eighth day of the second month; the *Sutra of Causes and Effects* says the seventh day of the third month; the *Sutra of Auspicious Responses* says the eighth day of the fourth month at midnight. According to the *Tang Comprehensive Institutions*, the *Sutras of the Buddha* from the Jin and Song dynasties record: In the kingdom of Lumbinī, the king’s son, the Buddha-to-be, was born. His father was named Śuddhodana, his mother Māyā. The Buddha’s body was golden-hued, his hair like dark silk. Initially, Māyā dreamed of a white elephant and conceived. At birth, he emerged from his mother’s right side. Born with a topknot, he took seven steps upon touching the earth. This kingdom lay within India, where there was also a divine person named Śāriputra.

The *Record of Buddhism and Daoism* in the *History of the Later Wei* states: Śākyamuni was the son of the King of Kapilavastu in India. "Tianzhu" (India) was its general name, while "Jinwei" was a specific designation. At first, Śākyamuni was born from his mother’s right side on the night of the eighth day of the fourth month. At birth, his appearance was extraordinary in thirty-two ways, and thirty-two auspicious signs descended from heaven in response—this is fully recounted in the *Sutra of Origins*. Śākyamuni was born in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, which corresponds to the summer of the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, when the "weeping star" vanished and the night shone bright. By the eighth year of Emperor Wu of the Wei, 1,237 years had passed.

The *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *History of the Sui* states: Śākyamuni was born on the eighth day of the fourth month in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, emerging from his mother’s right side. His appearance was wondrous, possessing thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics. He renounced the throne, left home to cultivate the Dao, practiced with diligence and devotion, and awakened to omniscience—thus he was called the Buddha, also *Buddha* or *Fo Tuo* in the Hu language. Translated into Chinese, this means "Pure Awakening." His hair and beard were curly, his strength great, and his archery superb. At seventeen, his father arranged his marriage to three daughters of the Gautama clan—Gopā, Yaśodharā, and Mrigajā—who bore him two sons: the elder Rāhula, the younger Ānanda. Twelve years later, while touring the four city gates, he witnessed the sights of birth, aging, sickness, and death. Startled and terrified, he recalled his past causes, abandoned his home, and fled the city. Entering the Snow Mountains, he dwelled beneath an *arura* tree, cultivating the Dao once taught by the perfected Master Yin. The Hu people named the tree *bodhi*, which in Chinese means "the Way." After enduring hardships for six years, his Dao was perfected. His body took on a golden hue, resembling the Buddha’s form, and he was called Śākyamuni. He entered nirvāṇa on the fifteenth day of the second month in the fourth year of King Kuang’s reign, the *renzǐ* year. At that time, the first month was reckoned as the *zi* month; thus, the former second month became the present twelfth month. In the Western Regions, the Buddha’s passing is called *nirvāṇa*. The *Golden Light Sutra* asks: "Why is the Tathāgata’s lifespan so brief, only eighty years?" This is the explanation.

Some claim Lord Lao was born on the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the third year of King Ding’s reign, while the Buddha was born in the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao’s reign and entered nirvāṇa in the thirteenth year of King Mu’s reign. They assert the Buddha’s birth and death preceded Lord Lao’s emergence from the Pass, seeking to disprove the tradition that Laozi transformed the Hu and became the Buddha. However, Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of Immortals* states: Laozi was born in the Shang dynasty. The *Generational Records* say: In the Shang, he was the Archivist of the Royal Treasury; in the Zhou, he was the Archivist beneath the Pillars. Xue Daoheng’s stele inscription states: During the reigns of Kings Wen and Wu, he held the offices of Archivist of the Treasury and Archivist beneath the Pillars. If he were born in King Ding’s time, how could he have served as the Archivist of the Treasury for King Wen of the Zhou? The Buddha’s birth and death are matters of common knowledge in past and present—these cannot be altered.

The *Record of Buddhism and Daoism* in the *History of the Wei* and the *Bibliographic Treatise* of the *History of the Sui* both state that Śākyamuni was born in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, corresponding to the summer of the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, when the "weeping star" vanished and the night shone bright. By the eighth year of Emperor Wu of the Wei, 1,237 years had passed. Furthermore, Wang Jianqi of the Qi dynasty composed the *Stele of the Toutuo Temple*, which reads: "The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the mirror of the night’s radiance; the two Ming emperors of Han and Jin together inscribed the adornments of cinnabar and azure." The temple and stele still stand in Ezhu, and Xiao Zhaoming once included it in the *Wen Xuan*. The Five Ministers’ commentary states: The Buddha was born in the time of King Zhuang of Zhou and Duke Zhuang of Lu; his teachings came to China in the reign of Emperor Ming of Han and flourished in the reign of Emperor Ming of Jin—hence the phrase "two Zhuangs, two Mings." Xiao Zhaoming was a devout Buddhist; had his words been false, would he have included them in the *Wen Xuan*?

Later scholars, failing to follow the ancients, recklessly fabricated heterodoxies, arbitrarily altering the Buddha’s birth and death to precede him by thirteen reigns and over 340 years. Such deception is egregious. Moreover, since the Eastern Han, numerous Hu monks have entered China, all speaking truthfully. By the time of Yao Qin, over three hundred years had passed without any dissenting views. Yet contentious individuals suddenly sought to overturn the established accounts of their predecessors, insisting on their own theories. Who would believe them?

As seen in the *Treatise on Bibliography* of the *Old唐书*, under the "Masters and Philosophers" (*Zi*) category, the *Dao* of Laozi is listed first, followed by the deluded teachings of immortals, and finally the general catalog of Buddhist schools is appended as a branch of Daoism—no separate category was ever established.

When Ouyang Wenzhong (Ouyang Xiu) compiled the *New唐书*, his accounts of Laozi and the Buddha were exceedingly brief. Only in the *Biography of Tianzhu* (*India*) does he record that during the Zhenguan era, envoys came to offer exotic treasures and a map of their land, along with a request for an image of Lao Jun. Some, failing to comprehend, still ask: "Why did Lao Jun not transform the Hu barbarians and attain the Dao, but instead became a Buddha?" They do not realize that in the language of Tianzhu, *bodhi* is simply the Hu word for *Dao*. Buddhist scriptures also speak of Śākyamuni entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao, and of his attaining the Dao after six years. Thus, *Buddha-Dao* may be used as a general term—just as in China, those who cultivate the Dao and ascend to transcendence do not speak of "attaining the Dao" but of "becoming immortals."

Now, according to the *Devadatta Chapter* of the *Lotus Sutra*: The Buddha declared, "In kalpas long past, I was once a king who, for the sake of seeking the Dharma, relinquished my throne and served an immortal. For a thousand years, the immortal taught me the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra*. Now, I have perfected the six pāramitās—compassion, joy, and equanimity—attained the thirty-two marks, the eighty subsidiary characteristics, the radiant golden hue, and realized perfect enlightenment."

Thus, an ancient Chan master’s preface to the *Introduction* states: "Śākyamuni himself recounted that in a former life, he abandoned his kingdom and renounced glory to serve an immortal and study the Dao—hence the *Devadatta Chapter*." Zhang Wujin’s *Comprehensive Treatise* also says: "The Buddha’s service to the immortal demonstrates the rarity of encountering a good spiritual friend. The immortal’s teaching of the Buddha shows that the Dharma is transmitted orally, while the Buddha realized it in his mind."

If Gautama, in kalpas long past, already served an immortal, then the Way of Immortals has existed since ancient times. Since the immortal taught him the sutra, enabling him to attain the six pāramitās and realize perfect enlightenment, the immortal may rightly be called the Buddha’s teacher. The Buddha appeared in the world for one great cause and reason, expounding this sutra without falsehood. His integrity—neither deceiving his own heart nor betraying his teacher—lies precisely in directly revealing his origins. This is why he is the Buddha.

Shuanglin Fu Dashi, known in the world as Maitreya Buddha, still revered the Dao above Buddhism, hence he wore a Daoist cap while draped in a kāṣāya. Hanshan of Tiantai, an emanation of Mañjuśrī—who is the teacher of the seven Buddhas—composed a verse:

*My home lies beneath the green cliffs,*
*My garden overgrown, untended.*
*Two or three scrolls of immortal script,*
*Beneath the trees, I read them murmuring.*

Another verse says:
*Hanshan, a mere worm,*
*Body white, head black,*
*Clutching two scrolls—*
*One the Dao, one virtue.*
*Ever wielding the sword of wisdom,*
*To slay the thieves of affliction.*

His *Lament for the World* also states:
*Buried beneath brambles,*
*Dusk falls, how dark!*
*Though you gnaw your iron lips,*
*No way to recite the scriptures of Laozi.*

Observing the sages of old, all knew to honor Laozi and revere the Dao. Yet later scholars, failing to investigate the roots, slander their teachers and betray the Dao—how lamentable!

After Śākyamuni entered nirvāṇa, he ascended to the thirty-second heaven, rising to the Jiayi Heaven and dwelling in the Yan Zhen Palace as the leader of the *Zhongmin* Heaven, known as the *Shanhui Zhenren* (Benevolent and Wise Perfected One). According to the *Benxiang Sutra*: "With all residual habits extinguished and mind-and-consciousness forgotten, he transcended the three realms and ascended into the *Zhongmin*." The *Benshi Sutra* states: "After the Buddha’s passing, he ascended to the thirty-second heaven, eternally abiding in the position of the Kui constellation in the Su Heaven." The Kui constellation has thirty-six stars, of which one is his. The thirty-second heaven marks the boundary of the *Zhongmin* Heaven, called the *Pingyu Jiayi Heaven*. Within it lies a separate palace, named *Yan Zhen*, for the Kui constellation descends from the lower reaches of the Jiayi Heaven.

The *Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism* in the *History of the Later Wei* also records: "The Buddha, having attained the Dao in the Western Hu lands, now presides as the lord of the Yan Zhen Palace in the thirty-second heaven." Li Chunfeng’s commentary on the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl* states: "The *Shanhui Zhenren* is the later incarnation of the Buddha of Tianzhu." Could this be said without evidence?

*Record of the Sage of Primordial Chaos, Volume Five* concludes.

**Record of the Sage of Primordial Chaos, Volume Six**
*Compiled by Song Dynasty Master of Observance, the Eminent Scholar Xie Shoubin*

Among Laozi’s disciples was Xin Pi, also known as Jiran, who was the teacher of Fan Li. His Daoist name was Wenzi, and his written work is titled *The Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries*. He was originally a prince of Jin.

Once, he asked the Old Master: “What are Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual?”

The Old Master replied:
—To act without contrivance, to be formless, to cultivate the self within and govern others without, to accomplish deeds and establish affairs, and to dwell in harmony with Heaven—this is the Dao.
—To nurture and sustain, to foster and mature, to benefit all without discrimination, and to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is virtue.
—To remain unassuming in great matters, unneglectful in small ones, to love universally without partiality, and to endure without decline—this is benevolence.
—When in a superior position, to aid the weak; when in a subordinate position, to uphold integrity; when prosperous, to refrain from recklessness; when impoverished, to remain steadfast; to follow the principle in all things, never bending for private gain—this is righteousness.
—To be reverent and solemn in high rank, humble and yielding in low station, to retreat in modesty and embrace softness, to be as yielding as the world’s female principle, to stand in timidity, to act as though incapable—this is ritual.

Thus, cultivating the Dao ensures the submission of those below; cultivating virtue ensures their obedience to commands; cultivating benevolence ensures they do not contend; cultivating righteousness ensures their fairness; cultivating ritual ensures their reverence. When all five are cultivated, the household and state are at peace—this is how the sage governs the myriad things.

Without the Dao, those below rebel; without virtue, they resent; without benevolence, they contend; without righteousness, they grow violent; without ritual, they descend into chaos. No state has ever survived the absence of these five.

Wenzi further asked: “What is the foundation of governing a state?”

The Old Master replied: “I have never heard of a ruler whose person was well-ordered yet whose state was in turmoil. When one cultivates stillness to refine the self and frugality to nurture life, the people below are not disturbed, and the populace does not resent. Thus, Heaven covers with the Dao, Earth bears with virtue, the four seasons do not lose their order, wind and rain do not turn tyrannical, the sun and moon remain clear, and the five planets align in measure.

The foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people; the foundation of pacifying the people lies in meeting their needs; the foundation of meeting their needs lies in not seizing from them; the foundation of not seizing lies in moderating expenditures; the foundation of moderating expenditures lies in reducing affairs; the foundation of reducing affairs lies in non-action.

Non-action does not mean refusing to draw near when summoned, resisting when pushed away, ignoring when pressed, or remaining unmoved when stirred—nor does it mean stagnation without flow, or clenching without release. Rather, it means private ambitions do not intrude upon the public Dao, and desires do not distort correct methods. It is to act in accordance with cycles, to achieve in harmony with the times, to delegate responsibilities to subordinates, and to undertake no misguided affairs. Names are self-assigned, categories self-applied, and matters proceed naturally, without originating from the self. Thus, affairs are accomplished without self-praise, merits are established without self-possession—like using a boat to traverse water, a sled to cross mountains, cultivating fields on high ground, or forming ponds in low places. This is not what I call ‘action.’

The ancient establishment of emperors and kings was not to indulge their desires. The sage who ascends the throne does not seek ease and pleasure for himself. For the people of the world, the strong oppress the weak, the many tyrannize the few, the wise deceive the foolish, the brave bully the timid. Those with talent do not teach one another; those with wealth do not share it. Thus, the Son of Heaven was instituted to unify them. Since one person’s wisdom cannot illuminate all under Heaven, the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist him. Since distant lands and foreign customs could not receive his grace, the feudal lords were appointed to govern and pacify them. Thus, Heaven’s tasks are all fulfilled, the seasons all respond, officials do not conceal their talents, and the state suffers no neglected benefits.

Therefore, the laws of the former kings decreed: Do not kill the unborn, do not take eggs, do not drain marshes to fish, do not burn forests to hunt. Before the jackals have offered their prey, traps may not be set in the wild. Before the otters have offered their fish, nets may not enter the waters. Before the hawks have struck, snares may not be spread in the valleys. Before the trees have shed their leaves, axes may not enter the forests. Before insects have burrowed, fire may not be used for hunting. Do not kill pregnant creatures, do not take fledgling birds, do not catch fish under a foot long, do not eat dogs or pigs under a year old. Thus, the flourishing of the myriad things is like rising steam. This is how the former kings aligned with the seasons, perfected their preparations, enriched the state, and benefited the people.

When water is muddied, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, people rebel. When superiors are covetous, inferiors harbor deceit; when superiors are demanding, inferiors contend. Cunning and deceit sprout, thieves and bandits multiply. Addressing the branches without tending to the root is like digging a ditch to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish a fire.

The sage governs with few affairs and brings order; seeks little yet provides abundantly; bestows benevolence without action; commands trust without speech; obtains without seeking; gathers without acting. Preserving authenticity and embracing the Dao, the world follows like a shadow or echo. This is called non-action.”

Wenzi said: “I have heard your teaching on governance through non-action. May I now inquire about instruction without words?”

The Old Master replied: “Heaven attains its height, Earth attains its depth, the sun and moon shine, the stars and constellations gleam—yet none speak. They rectify their Dao, and things arise naturally. The Yin and Yang and the four seasons do not generate the myriad things; timely rain and dew do not nurture grasses and trees. It is the union of spirit and clarity, the harmony of Yin and Yang, that allows things to grow of themselves.

The Dao conceals essence within, lodges spirit in the heart, abides in stillness and tranquility, delights in harmony within the breast, vast and formless, silent and soundless. The government offices seem idle, the court appears empty. There are no recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. The world all looks up to the ruler’s virtue, follows the sovereign’s guidance. Even distant lands and foreign customs, though requiring multiple translations, come of their own accord—not because every household has been visited and every person instructed, but because the ruler extends his sincere heart to all under Heaven.”

Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the evil are matters of government decrees, but what enables their enforcement is the power of sincerity. Though decrees may be clear, they cannot act alone—they must await sincerity. Sincerity takes form within and is understood outwardly in the hearts of people; this is the Way of non-action. When the sage rules from above, embracing the Dao without speech, his beneficence extends to all directions. How vast, then, is the teaching of non-action!

Therefore, when the ruler’s thoughts do not stray in his breast, when his knowledge does not extend beyond the four realms, when he holds sincerity in his heart and acts upon it, timely sweet rains fall, the five grains flourish, the people are nourished with impartiality, awe-inspiring majesty remains untested, laws are few and unobtrusive, prisons stand empty, and the world shares a single custom, none harboring treacherous intent. Thus, when sincerity moves Heaven, auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, soaring phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, and seas do not surge with waves. But if one defies Heaven and ravages the world, the sun and moon grow dim and eclipse, the five stars stray from their courses, the four seasons fall into discord, daylight darkens and night glows, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, winter thunders and summer frosts appear, celestial omens turn ominous, and the state faces peril and ruin. Heaven and humanity share a mutual resonance.

The workings of spirit and clarity cannot be achieved through cunning or force; only the sage harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth, his brightness with the sun and moon, his numinosity with ghosts and spirits, his reliability with the four seasons. Embracing Heaven’s heart, holding fast to its darkness, grasping the balanced and harmonious, he need not leave his hall to traverse the four seas, transforming customs and guiding all to goodness as if it arose from within themselves—this is called spiritual transformation, for it is the practice of the teaching of non-action.

Wenzi bowed twice and asked, “I have reverently received your instruction on the foundation of governing the state. What, then, is the foundation of governing the self?”

The Old Master said, “Come, let me tell you. The highest way is to nurture the spirit; the next is to nurture the form. When the spirit is clear and the mind at peace, all the body’s joints are at rest—this is the foundation of nurturing life. To fatten the flesh and fill the belly, to restrain desires and passions—these are but the lesser aspects of nurturing life.

One who tends to the foundation regulates rest and activity, moderates food and drink, harmonizes joy and anger, and balances movement and stillness. When what lies within is secure, no perverse influences can enter. Human beings are born through the transformations of Heaven and Earth: in the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood forms; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it grows restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera assume their offices. The liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, the gallbladder the mouth. The head is round, modeling Heaven; the feet are square, resembling Earth.

Heaven has its four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty days; humans have their four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. Humans are made in the likeness of Heaven and Earth: the sun and moon govern the ears and eyes, while wind and rain correspond to blood and qi. When the sun and moon stray from their courses, they dim and eclipse; when wind and rain come untimely, they bring destruction and disaster. When the five stars stray, the state suffers calamity.

The Way of Heaven and Earth is vast and boundless, yet even it moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and clarity. How, then, can human ears and eyes endure prolonged stimulation without rest, or human sincerity gallop without exhaustion? Thus, the sage guards the inner and does not guard the outer.

Blood and qi are the glory of humanity; the five viscera are its essence. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not scatter outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and sight are keen. When the five viscera remain aligned with the heart and do not stray, the mind prevails and conduct is upright. When spirit and essence are abundant and do not dissipate, one hears all without fail, sees all without obstruction, and accomplishes all without hindrance.

Thus, adorning the outer harms the inner; indulging the emotions exhausts the spirit. Valuing appearances corrupts authenticity; a moment’s forgetfulness of one’s own worth must strain one’s nature. One who cannot walk a hundred paces without thinking of his appearance will burden his form. Therefore, beautiful plumage harms the bones, and lush branches injure the roots. Stillness and tranquility nurture life; harmony, joy, and emptiness uphold virtue. When the outer does not disturb the inner, one’s nature finds its proper place; when stillness does not interfere with activity, one attains peace in one’s position.

To nurture life while engaging with the world, to embrace virtue while cultivating longevity—this may be called embodying the Dao. The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, ordering what has no form. Silent and unmoving, it pervades all, vast and obscure. It is too deep and broad to be considered external, too minute and subtle to be considered internal. It begins in softness and weakness and ends in hardness and strength. It governs what is short and few and completes what is long and many. Thus, a tree ten spans in girth begins as a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins with a single basket of earth.

Therefore, the Perfected One embodies it through emptiness and simplicity, tranquility and softness, purity and plainness, not mingling with things. Aligning with the Way of Heaven and Earth, he is called the Perfected One. Emptiness is the dwelling of the Dao; simplicity is its essence. Tranquility is its mirror; softness is its function. Purity is its core.

Desires do not burden the utmost emptiness; love and hate do not disturb the utmost simplicity. Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness; adapting to the times is the utmost softness. Not scattering for things is the utmost purity. Thus, when the sage values the world lightly, his spirit is not encumbered; when he regards the myriad things as small, his spirit is not confused. When he equalizes life and death, his mind is not daunted; when he unites with change and transformation, his clarity is not dazzled. Stillness shares virtue with Yin; movement flows with Yang. He is neither distant nor close, aligning with the Dao as his boundary and with virtue as his neighbor. He leans on an unshakable pillar, walks an unbroken path, draws from an inexhaustible storehouse, and learns from an immortal teacher. Thus, there is nowhere he does not succeed, nothing he does not penetrate.”

Wenzi bowed twice and received the teaching.

King Ping of Zhou asked Wenzi, “I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. Now, though a worthy man may possess the Dao, if he encounters an age of chaos and strife, and seeks to transform a long-troubled people with the power of one man alone, how could this be possible?”

Wenzi replied, “Virtue and the Dao rectify the crooked to make them straight, rouse the disordered to make them well-ordered, and transform the corrupt and ruined to restore their simplicity and purity. They cause virtue to be reborn, and the world to attain peace and tranquility—all hinges upon one man. Thus, the accumulation of virtue makes a king, while the accumulation of resentment brings ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle, while Jie and Zhou perished by it.”

King Ping followed his words, and the world was governed.

Wenzi again studied under the Old Master and received the method of the divine elixir, thereby attaining the rank of an immortal.

Shicheng Qi came from Chu to see the Old Master and said, “I have heard that you are a great sage. For this reason, I did not shrink from the long journey to come here, wishing to see you even if it meant a hundred nights of lodging and repeated inquiry without rest. Yet now I observe that you are no sage: you have more than enough grain stored in rat holes while abandoning your younger sister—this is not benevolence. Before you, food is not fully consumed, yet you ceaselessly accumulate without limit.”

The Old Master remained silent and did not respond. Shicheng Qi withdrew.

The next day, he returned and said, “Yesterday, I spoke rashly against you. Today, my words ring true, yet my heart feels constrained. My form stands upright, and my heart is correct—why then do I feel this way?”

The Old Master said, “Those who are cunning, clever, and spiritually sagely—I have long since cast off such traits. In the past, when you called me an ox, I became an ox; when you called me a horse, I became a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name given by others, one invites calamity. I wear ordinary clothes, not because I cling to attire.”

Thereupon, Shicheng Qi walked like a crow, avoiding his shadow, and advanced with measured steps to ask, “How should one cultivate the self?”

The Old Master said, “Your bearing is overbearing, your gaze piercing, your forehead protruding, your mouth gaping, and your demeanor rigid—you seem like a horse tethered in place. When you move, you clutch your hair as if it were a trigger; when you observe, you scrutinize with cunning intelligence, and your vision is clouded by excess. All this stems from a lack of trust. At the edge of your domain, there is a thief.”

Shicheng Qi paused, then withdrew.

The Old Master traveled west to Qin. Yang Ziju awaited him at the outskirts and, upon reaching Liang, encountered him. Midway, the Old Master looked up to the sky and sighed, “At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.”

Yang Ziju did not respond.

Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying, “Earlier, Master, you looked up to the sky and sighed. Your disciple wished to ask, but you were walking without pause, so I dared not. Now that you are at rest, may I inquire about my fault?”

The Old Master said, “Haughty and overbearing—with whom could you dwell? The purest white appears stained; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.”

Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said, “I have received your instruction.”

In the past, when he traveled, innkeepers would greet him, the master of the house would hold his mat, his wife would hold his towel and comb, guests would rise from their seats, and those warming themselves by the fire would yield their place. Upon his return, the innkeepers now vied with him for space.

Another day, he saw the Old Master again. The Old Master said, “The patterns of tigers and leopards, the agility of apes and monkeys—these invite arrows. Why is this so?”

Yang Ziju said, “May I dare ask about the governance of an enlightened king?”

The Old Master said, “His achievements cover the world, yet he seems not to claim them as his own. His transformative influence extends to the myriad things, yet he does not wait to possess virtue. He does not proclaim his name, standing in the unfathomable and roaming in the realm of nothingness.”

The Old Master’s disciple Gengsang Chu, also known as Kangcangzi, had partially attained the Old Master’s Dao. He lived in the north on Mount Weilü. His ministers were arrogant, and the wise departed from him; his concubines were insolent, and the benevolent kept their distance. Only the deformed and the indolent remained with him, serving as his attendants.

After three years, Weilü flourished. Its people said to one another, “When we calculate day by day, Master Gengsang seems insufficient, but when we calculate year by year, he has abundance. Perhaps he is a sage—why not enthrone him as our lord, worship him as our spirit, and honor him as our grain deity?”

Gengsang Chu heard this and, facing south, was displeased. He said, “When spring’s energy arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due course, the myriad treasures mature. Is this not the result of inherent attainment? I have heard that the perfected person dwells in a humble abode, and the people do not know where to turn. Now, with the petty people of Weilü whispering among themselves, desiring to offer sacrificial vessels to one deemed a sage, I am thus reminded of the Old Master’s words.”

Nanrong Qu asked, “I am already advanced in years. How should I entrust my studies?”

Gengsang Chu said, “Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and worries run rampant.”

Qu said, “The eyes and the form—I do not see their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ears and the form—I do not see their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I do not see their difference, yet the deluded cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are separate, yet things sometimes seek one another without success. Now you tell me to preserve my form, embrace my life, and not let my thoughts and worries run rampant. I have striven to hear this teaching, and it has reached my ears.”

Gengsang Chu, having exhausted his words, said, “A running bee cannot transform a chrysalis; a Yue chicken cannot hatch a swan’s egg; a Lu chicken, however, is fully capable. Chickens are all chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot. The difference lies in the size of their capacity. Now, my capacity is insufficient to transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?”

Nanrong Qu then prepared provisions for seven days and seven nights and arrived at the Old Master’s abode. The Old Master said, “Have you come from Chu?”

Qu replied, “Yes.”

The Old Master said, “Why have you come with such a crowd?”

Qu looked back in alarm. The Old Master said, “Do you not understand what I mean?”

Nanrong Qu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, saying, “Just now, I forgot my own answers and so lost my own questions.”

The Old Master said, “What do you mean?”

After a long while, Qu asked again, “If I am ignorant, people call me foolish; if I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. If I lack benevolence, I harm others; if I possess it, it only brings sorrow to myself. If I lack righteousness, I injure others; if I possess it, it only brings sorrow to my own self. How can I escape these three dilemmas?”

These were the afflictions that troubled him, and he wished to ask the Old Master about them through the example of Chu.

The Old Master said, “Earlier, when I saw the questions in your brows and eyes, I had already grasped your heart. Now you speak again and confirm it—why do you cling so stubbornly, as if you had lost your parents and were raising a pole to search for them in the sea? You are a lost man indeed! Bewildered, you seek to return to your original nature yet find no way in. How pitiful!”

Nanrong Qu then asked to withdraw to his lodging. There, he gathered what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of self-reflection, he returned to see the Old Master.

The Old Master said, “You have cleansed yourself—why then do you remain so troubled? And though your inner state seems to flow, there is still something foul within. Those who are bound by external things cannot grasp and direct them inward, and those who are entangled within cannot mislead and direct them outward. Those who are lashed by both inner and outer forces cannot be upheld by the Dao and its virtue—how much less those who abandon the Dao and act recklessly!”

Qu said, “When a villager falls ill, his neighbors ask about it. If the sick man can describe his illness, he is not yet truly ill. My hearing of the Great Dao is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life.”

The Old Master said, “Can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you come to rest? Can you cease striving? Can you abandon seeking in others and seek within yourself? Can you be supple like a fish? Can you be empty like a valley? Can you be like a child? One who wails all day yet makes no hoarse sound has reached perfect harmony. One who gazes all day yet does not strain his eyes has no bias toward externals. One who grasps all day yet does not cramp his hands shares in the virtue of all things. In movement, he does not know where he goes; at rest, he does not know what he does. He flows with things, merging with their waves—this is the classic of preserving life.”

Qu said, “Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?”

The Old Master replied, “No, this is merely what is called ‘the melting of ice and the thawing of frost.’ The perfected person shares food upon the earth and delights together in Heaven. He does not use others for gain or harm, nor does he conspire with them in strangeness, scheming, or affairs. He comes like a fish gliding, goes like a valley echoing—this is the classic of preserving life.”

Qu asked, “Then is this the ultimate?”

The Old Master said, “Not yet. I have told you: can you be like a child? A child moves without knowing what he does, walks without knowing where he goes. His body is like a withered branch, his heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, where can there be human calamity?”

Qu bowed twice, expressed his gratitude, and departed. His spirit became clear and luminous, and for ten days he ate nothing, yet felt as though he had feasted on a grand sacrifice. His wisdom encompassed heaven and earth, and he discerned the finest details as if examining autumn down.

King Ding later asked the Old Master, “Are there any divine immortals in the world today who can be known?”

The Old Master replied, “On the Eastern Marchmount resides Master Zhan Qin; on the Southern Marchmount, Master Kuang Xu; on the Western Marchmount, Yin Xi; on the Northern Marchmount, the August Person; and on the Central Marchmount, the Ancient Master—that is I. Xu, styled Zixiao, was a disciple of mine. He cultivated the Dao on Mount Lu for seven hundred years and ascended to immortality in broad daylight during the reign of King Lie. When the king heard of his name, he sent envoys to summon him. The envoys arrived at his dwelling, but found only an empty hermitage. They then memorialized the throne, requesting that the Southern Zhan Mountain be renamed Jinglu Mountain, and that it also be called Kuangfu after the master’s surname. According to the *Erya’s Explanation of Names*, a ‘fu’ is a mound of earth. This mountain was originally called Southern Zhan, for atop it were the Three Heavenly Zhang. In ancient times, Mount Qian was revered as the Southern Marchmount, while Southern Zhan was considered a reserve of blessings, hence it was also called the Southern Marchmount. In the fifth year of the Yuanfeng era of Emperor Wu of Han, during his imperial tour to sacrifice to the famous mountains and great rivers, he shot a dragon in the Xunyang River. Turning to ask which deity presided over this mountain, Liu Xiang replied, ‘Master Kuang Xu attained the Dao here.’ The emperor then ordered a shrine built at Huhan. The shrine was later included in the official sacrifices. During the Eastern Jin, when Huan Yi governed Jiujiang, he favored Buddhism. At the request of the monk Huiyuan of Mameng, he relocated the master’s shrine to the riverside and converted the site into a monastic dwelling—this is the present Donglin Temple. After the master’s ascension, the Old Master bestowed upon him the rank of Perfected Person and charged him with overseeing droughts and floods in Wu and Chu. He also granted him the Seal of Pestilence, placing him in command of the Eight Divisions of Pestilence Spirits. Thus, he came to be popularly known as Master Kuangfu, the Harmonizer of Pestilence. In the first year of the Jianzhong Jingguo era of the Song dynasty, in the ninth month, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Person of Serene Illumination. During rituals for averting calamities, imperial prayer tablets were customarily bestowed, and local officials were dispatched to the temple to perform rites.

In the seventeenth year of King Jing’s reign, in the year *wuxu*, Confucius said to Nan’gong Jingshu, “I have heard that Lao Dan is profoundly learned in ancient and modern matters, understands the origins of ritual and music, and clarifies the return of the Dao and its virtue—he is my teacher. I intend to visit him.”

Jingshu replied, “I humbly receive your command.”

He then addressed the Lord of Lu, saying, “Your servant has received the command of our late lord, who said: ‘Confucius is a descendant of sages, though his lineage was extinguished in Song. His ancestor, Fufu He, once held a state but yielded it to Duke Li, while Zheng Kaofu assisted Dukes Dai, Wu, and Xuan, growing ever more reverent with each appointment, as recorded in the inscriptions on the tripods. Zang Sun once said, “If a sage-king were to arise in this age, he would surely have enlightened ministers.” Confucius, though young, is fond of ritual—he is destined for greatness. You must take him as your teacher.’ Now Confucius is about to journey to Zhou to observe the legacy of the former kings and examine the ultimate principles of ritual and music. This is a grand undertaking. Might my lord provide him with carriage and provisions? I request permission to accompany him.”

The Duke said, “Very well.” He then provided Confucius with a carriage, two horses, and one servant boy, and permitted him to accompany Shusun Jing. The following year, they arrived in Zhou, where Confucius met the Old Master. The Old Master said, “Have you come, sir? I have heard that you are a worthy man from the north. Have you attained the Dao?”

Confucius replied, “Not yet.”

The Old Master asked, “Where then have you sought it?”

Confucius said, “I sought it in the measures and numbers, but after five years I had not attained it.”

The Old Master asked, “And where else have you sought it?”

Confucius said, “I sought it in the principles of yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it.”

The Old Master said, “Indeed. If the Dao could be offered as a gift, no one would fail to present it to their lord. If the Dao could be advanced, no one would fail to offer it to their kin. If the Dao could be proclaimed to others, no one would fail to tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be given to others, no one would fail to bestow it upon their descendants. The reason it cannot be so is no other: without an inner master, it cannot be established; without outward rectitude, it cannot be put into practice. What issues from within is not received without; the sage does not emerge. What enters from without finds no master within; the sage does not conceal himself.”

Confucius withdrew. Before long, he again met the Old Master, bowed, and asked, “Earlier, in our leisurely conversation, I dared to inquire about the Great Dao.”

The Old Master said, “When the noble man finds the right time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that the good merchant hides his treasures as if empty, and the noble man of great virtue appears simple-minded. Rid yourself of your pride, excess, extravagant desires, affected manners, and wayward ambitions—none of these benefit your person. What I have told you is only this.”

Another day, Confucius again met the Old Master and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. The Old Master said, “If chaff gets in one’s eyes, the four directions seem to shift; if fleas and mosquitoes bite the skin, one cannot sleep all night. If you, sir, could ensure the world does not lose its simplicity, then heaven and earth would naturally have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their order, birds and beasts their flocks, and plants their rootedness. You wish to spread virtue and act, following the Dao in your pursuit—you have already arrived. Why then do you clamor for benevolence and righteousness as if beating a drum to seek a lost child? Alas, you would disorder human nature! The magpie does not bathe daily to be white, nor the crow dye itself black to be dark. The simplicity of black and white is not worth distinguishing; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. As the saying goes, when the spring dries up, fish find themselves on dry land, moistening one another with their dampness, wetting one another with their spittle—better they had forgotten one another in the rivers and lakes.”

Confucius returned and did not speak for three days. Zigong, finding this strange, asked, “Master, when you met the Old Master, what advice did he give you?”

Confucius said, “Ah! Of birds, I know they can fly; of fish, I know they can swim; of beasts, I know they can run. For those that fly, I can use a net; for those that swim, I can use a line; for those that run, I can use a snare. But as for the dragon—it coalesces into form, scatters into patterns, rides the clouds and ascends to heaven—this I cannot fathom. Today, when I saw the Old Master, he was like the dragon. My mouth gaped and could not close; my spirit was confounded, and I knew not where to abide. What advice could I give the Old Master?”

Yang Jie’s preface to the *Record of Laozi* states: “Laozi existed before heaven and earth, and none know whose son he was. He aged after heaven and earth, and was forcibly named the father of a single dawn. Born with hair as white as blossoms, he lived long. Though weak, he could speak—not from learned instruction. Though solemn, he could be as tender as an infant, devoted to softness. Conceived in the womb of Mother Yin, he descended in Renli. His descendants followed, as do all people. He took the surname Li without attachment. His ears were large, his eyes broad; his forehead bore the sun’s angle, his temples the moon’s depth. Two pillars, three gates—grasping ten, treading five—he was the manifestation of a divine person. He studied under Rongcheng, sought the Dao from Changcong, having no fixed teacher. In the time of Fuxi, he was Yuhua Zi; in the time of Shennong, Dacheng Zi; in the time of Zhu Rong, Guangshou Zi; in the time of Shangyang, Chijing Zi; in the time of Di Ku, Lutu Zi; in the time of Tang Yao, Wucheng Zi; in the time of Yu of Xia, Zhenxing Zi; in the time of Tang of Shang, Xize Zi; in the time of King Wen of Zhou, Xieyi Zi.”

It further states: “As Grand Scribe, he became in heaven the Golden Gate Emperor, the Supreme Radiance Lord, the Divine Treasure Venerable—having no fixed name. Whether as Hidden Scribe or Pillar Scribe, he did not choose his office. When Zhou declined, he departed through the pass, retiring in due time. The wondrous essence of the Dao and virtue, the divine and numinous chapters—these are the laws of heaven and humanity. He revolved and governed creation, inhaling and exhaling yin and yang, ascending and descending with the stars, regulating the nine transformations. He refined metals and stones, commanded ghosts and spirits, trod upon shadows and soared through clouds, vanished his form and concealed his radiance. He attained long life and enduring vision, aiding the good and relieving distress, transcending the myriad transformations. The world knows not whether this is so or not, and thus calls him the Reclusive Noble Man.”

Confucius said, “Ah! Of birds, I know they can fly; of fish, I know they can swim; of beasts, I know they can run. But as for the dragon—it coalesces into form, scatters into patterns, rides the wind and clouds to ascend to heaven—this I cannot know. When I saw Laozi, he was like the dragon.” From ancient times to the present, many have spoken of Laozi, but none have matched Confucius’ words.

Zigong asked Confucius, “Is there truly a man who dwells like a corpse yet appears like a dragon, whose voice is like thunder yet whose depth is like an abyss, whose movements are like those of heaven and earth? Might I also behold such a one?”

Confucius said, “The white egret wanders freely, and all desire to see it. Towering like heaven, rumbling like thunder, bursting forth like rain—each bows their head. Zigong, how could you behold such a one?”

Zigong then sought an audience with the Old Master by invoking Confucius’ name. The Old Master was sitting in meditation when he responded faintly, saying, “My years have advanced and passed away. What would you admonish me with?”

Zigong stood trembling, unable to compose himself. The Old Master said, “Young man, you may return. Your teacher is named Qiu—only after admonishing him for three years may you be taught.”

Zigong returned, and Confucius said, “You have been shaken.” Zigong held his silence, unable to respond.

When Confucius later visited the Old Master, his disciples followed. The Old Master asked, “Who were those who came before?” Confucius replied, “Zhong You, brave and mighty; next, Zeng Shen, filial; next, Yan Hui, benevolent; next, Zhuan Sunshi, martial.”

The Old Master said, “I have heard that in the south there is a bird called the phoenix, adorned with sacred tassels of benevolence, trust on its left and wisdom on its right, strength in its talons and courage at its fore—yet even this is but a lesser being.”

The Old Master assisted in the burial of a man from the Daxiang clan, with Confucius following. When an eclipse occurred, the Old Master said, “Qiu, halt the bier by the roadside and cease wailing to observe the omen.” When the darkness passed, they returned and then proceeded with the burial.

Confucius asked, “A bier cannot be taken back—why halt during an eclipse?” The Old Master replied, “A bier should not depart too early nor rest too late; only criminals and those hastening to a parent’s funeral travel by starlight. How can one know the eclipse will not last until nightfall?”

Confucius asked, “For a child who dies young, is a coffin and burial rites used?” The Old Master said, “Long ago, I saw Shi Yi’s son die young, and the grave was distant. The Duke of Shao asked him, ‘Why not encoffin and prepare the body in the palace?’ Shi Yi replied, ‘How dare I?’ He consulted the Duke of Zhou, who said, ‘Why not?’ Thus, Shi Yi did so. The use of coffins and rites for young children began with him.”

Confucius asked, “After three years of mourning, when the final wailing is complete, are there no exceptions for military affairs?” The Old Master said, “In the past, Duke Boqin of Lu made an exception—this was due to the rebellion of the Xu Rong.”

Confucius asked, “In ancient times, when an army marched, the ancestral tablets were carried along—why?” The Old Master said, “When a lord departs his state, the Grand Steward takes the tablets of the ancestral temples to accompany him. For sacrifices to ancestors, the invocator welcomes the tablets of the four temples. When the tablets enter or leave the temple, the road is cleared as a ritual.”

Confucius asked, “I have heard that in ancient sacrifices to Heaven, the Five Emperors were embodied as divine effigies—is this so?” The Old Master said, “Heaven has the Five Phases—Wood, Fire, Metal, Water, and Earth—each governs its season, nurturing and assisting the Supreme Emperor in creating all things. These true spirits are called the Five Emperors.”

Confucius said, “May I ask who the Five Emperors are?” The Old Master replied:
“The Azure Emperor of the East, Weilingyang, wields the compass to govern spring.
The Vermilion Emperor of the South, Chipiaonu, wields the scale to govern summer.
The White Emperor of the West, Baizhaoju, wields the square to govern autumn.
The Black Emperor of the North, Shiguangji, wields the weight to govern winter.
The Yellow Emperor of the Center, Han Shuniu, wields the plumb line to govern the four seasons.
Thus, when ancient kings changed dynasties, they followed the Five Phases, renewing the Five Virtues in succession, cycling endlessly. Therefore, when a sage king dies, he is matched in sacrifice to one of the Five Phases. Thus, Tai Hao is matched with Wood, Yan Di with Fire, the Yellow Emperor with Earth, Shao Hao with Metal, and Zhuanxu with Water.”

Confucius said, “How profound! The Dao is truly difficult to practice. I have offered the Dao and submitted myself to the rulers of this age, yet none have accepted me. How hard it is to practice the Dao!”

The Old Master said, “Those who expound are swept away by eloquence; those who listen are confused by words. Knowing these two, the Dao cannot be entrusted. What you speak of—those men and their bones have long decayed; only their words remain. The *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* are but the remnants of the former kings—how could they be the essence? The remnants are what the feet tread upon, but the essence is not the tread. The white egret gazes at its mate, their pupils unmoving, yet they are transformed by the wind. The male insect calls from the upwind, the female responds from downwind, and they are transformed by the wind. All things become male and female and are transformed by the wind. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing from which one can be lost.”

Confucius withdrew to his lodging and did not emerge for three months. He then returned to see the Old Master and said, “I have grasped it. The fledgling crow and magpie, the fish that sprays foam, the slender-waisted wasp that transforms—if a younger brother exists, the elder weeps. For too long, I have not been transformed by humanity; how could I transform others?”

The Old Master said, “Good. You have grasped it.”

One day, Confucius went again to see the Old Master. The Old Master had just bathed and was letting his hair dry, standing so still he seemed not of this world. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he saw him and said, “Was I dazed? Was it truly so? Just now, Master, your form seemed like withered wood, as if you had forgotten things and stood apart from humanity.”

The Old Master said, “I wander in the beginning of things.”

Confucius asked, “What does this mean?”

The Old Master replied, “The mind is weary and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. I once tried to discuss what lies beyond. The utmost yin is solemn and silent, issuing from heaven; the utmost yang is blazing and radiant, bursting forth from earth. The two intermingle and harmonize, and all things are born. The principle of creation is unseen. Growth and decline, fullness and emptiness, darkness and light—day by day, month by month, they change. There is action, yet no sign of achievement. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end revolve without end, and none know where it ceases. If this is not it, then what is the origin?”

Confucius said, “May I ask about wandering in this?”

The Old Master said, “To attain this is the utmost beauty and utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is called the Perfected Person.”

Confucius said, “I wish to hear the method.”

The Old Master said, “Herbivorous beasts do not hasten to change their marshes; aquatic creatures do not hasten to change their waters. They undergo small changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight do not enter their breasts.

The world beneath heaven is the unity of the ten thousand things. If one attains this unity and becomes identical with it, then the four limbs and hundred parts of the body will be but dust and grime. Life and death, beginning and end will be as day and night, yet nothing can disturb them—how much less the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune?

To cast off servitude is like casting off a body of mud and mire. What is noble lies in servitude; what is noble lies in the self and does not lose itself in change. Moreover, the ten thousand transformations have never had a limit—what is there to trouble the heart?

Those who practice the Dao have resolved this.”

Confucius said, “The great person’s virtue matches heaven and earth, yet still borrows the utmost words to cultivate the heart. Among the ancients, which gentleman could escape this?”

The Old Master said, “Not so. Water’s relation to purity is effortless, and its talent is natural. The Perfected Person’s relation to virtue is uncontrived, and things cannot depart from it. The sky’s height is self-so; the earth’s thickness is self-so; the sun and moon’s brightness is self-so—what cultivation is there?

Confucius departed and told Yan Hui, saying, “In my relation to the Dao, am I not like a gnat in vinegar? Without the Master’s lifting of my covering, I would not have known the great completeness of heaven and earth.”

When Confucius was about to return to Lu, the Old Master saw him off, saying, “I have heard that the rich and noble give gifts of wealth to see others off; the humane give gifts of words. Though I cannot be rich and noble, I have presumptuously taken the name of the humane to offer you words as a parting gift.

Nowadays, among scholars, those who are keenly perceptive and deeply discerning yet near to death are those who delight in criticizing others. Those who are broadly eloquent and vastly learned yet endanger themselves are those who expose others’ faults. As a son, do not assert the self; as a minister, do not assert the self.”

Confucius said, “I respectfully receive your teaching.”

After returning from Zhou to Lu, his Dao grew ever more lofty, and disciples from distant regions came to follow him—numbering three thousand!

According to the *Ying Shen Yue Zhang* in the Tang dynasty’s *Kong Miao* rituals: “Through profound brilliance, he inquired of the Old Master to explore the truth. Three thousand disciples, five hundred worthies—his rules endure for a hundred ages, his temple stands for ten thousand years. With pure sincerity, they offer sacrifice, playing music to welcome the spirit.”

It is said that the *Da Le* once had these words, though their origin is unclear.

Wang Liao’s eulogy says: “Non-being has its origin; emptiness is the source of reality. Laozi’s clarity and stillness lodge intent in wordlessness. Thus he became Confucius’ teacher, preserving the One to endure long.”

Lu Shiheng’s eulogy says: “Kong Qiu, of profound sagacity, matched heaven and magnified it. His influence fanned the mysterious current; his grace ran deep as sacred treasure. Awakening, he yearned for Zhou; speaking, he modeled himself on the Old Master. This is no empty claim.”

Su Shi’s *Ancient History* says: “Confucius taught people with benevolence and righteousness, and governed the world with ritual and music. The changes of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are boundless, yet he declared, ‘My Dao is unified by one thread.’ If there were nothing to unify it, then acting according to change would be righteousness, and the hexagrams would have divisions that do not cohere.

The *Book of Changes* says, ‘That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the instrument.’ The *Analects* says, ‘The noble person ascends; the petty person descends.’ Yet Confucius called himself one who ‘studies below to ascend above.’ Sweeping and responding, the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, ritual, and music—all were what he studied. The noble person thereby ascends to the Dao; the petty person thereby obtains the instrument. Ascending to the Dao, the myriad changes attain unity; obtaining the instrument, one has constancy and does not waver. This is how Confucius attained both.

Now, Confucius’ character was all-embracing, so he showed people the instrument while concealing the Dao, making it easy for the enlightened to enter while preventing the unenlightened from being dazzled. Laozi’s self-cultivation was profound, so he showed people the Dao while omitting the instrument, making it easy for the enlightened to enter while not troubling himself over the unenlightened. In essence, both were devoted to the Dao, differing only in the order of their teachings.”

I have heard my elder brother Zizhan say: “The Grand Historian says that Zhuangzi wrote *The Fisherman*, *Robber Zhi*, and *The Old Fisherman’s Basket* to slander Confucius’ followers and clarify Laozi’s teachings. This is to know only the coarse side of Zhuangzi. I believe Zhuangzi’s words all grant reality in substance while withholding it in form, outwardly rejecting while covertly aiding. In his slander of Confucius, he never failed to subtly reveal his intent.”

The Grand Historian also says: “Shen [Buhai] and Han [Fei] were lacking in kindness, both deriving from the intent of the Dao and virtue.” Now, Shang Yang governed Qin with law; Shen Buhai governed Han with techniques. Statutes were displayed in government offices; punishments were engraved in the people’s hearts—this was called law. Assigning offices based on ability, holding officials accountable to their titles, wielding the power of life and death, and assessing the competence of ministers—this was called technique. Han Fei’s learning combined and employed both Shen and Shang’s methods. Where law reached, even the sagely and wise were not used. Where technique was wielded, even father and son did not trust one another. This was what Shen and Han called Laozi’s Dao, but in truth it was not.

A minister from Chen visited Lu and had a private audience with Shusun. Shusun said, “There is a sage in our state—do you know him?”

The minister said, “Is it not Kong Qiu?”

“Yes,” he replied.

“How do you know he is a sage?”

Shusun said, “I have heard that Yan Hui and Kong Qiu can discard the heart and employ the body.”

The minister from Chen said, “There is also a sage in our state—do you not know him?”

“Who is the sage?” he asked.

“Lao Dan’s disciple has one named Kang Cangzi, also called Gengsang Chu. His book is titled *The True Scripture of the Cavern Spirit*. He has attained the Dao of shame and can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.”

Shusun reported this to the Lord of Lu, who heard it with great astonishment. He sent his highest minister with generous gifts to invite him.

When Kang Cangzi arrived in Lu, the Lord of Lu humbly requested his instruction. Kang Cangzi said, “Those who transmitted this have spoken falsely. I can see and hear without relying on my ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse the functions of ears and eyes.”

The Lord of Lu said, “This is most extraordinary! What is the nature of your Way?”

Kang Cangzi replied, “The body aligns with the heart, the heart aligns with qi, qi aligns with spirit, and spirit aligns with the formless. With resolute presence and resonant harmony, though distant beyond the eight wilds or near as one’s brows and lashes, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures and four limbs that perceive it, or my heart and six viscera that comprehend it—it is simply self-knowing.”

The Lord of Lu was greatly pleased. Later, he told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not respond.

The Grand Steward Dang of Shang visited Confucius and asked, “Is Qiu a sage?”

Confucius said, “How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Qiu is merely one who has broadly studied and retains much knowledge.”

The Grand Steward said, “Were the Three Kings sages?”

Confucius said, “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage. As for sagacity, Qiu does not know.”

He asked, “Were the Five Emperors sages?”

Confucius said, “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness. As for sagacity, Qiu does not know.”

He asked, “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?”

Confucius said, “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in following the times. As for sagacity, Qiu does not know.”

The Grand Steward was greatly startled and said, “Then who is a sage?”

Confucius changed his expression and said, “In the West there is a man who may be a sage. He governs without disorder, is trusted without speaking, and transforms without instruction. Vast and boundless, the people cannot name him. Qiu suspects he may be a sage, but does not know whether he is truly a sage or not.”

The Grand Steward silently thought, “Is Kong Qiu deceiving me?”

Laozi harmonized his light with the dust, engaged in non-action, and practiced the teaching without words. Thus Confucius admired his sagacity and went to study under him. Moreover, if Kang Cangzi is already called a sage by the multitude, how much more so his master!

Lu bordered the Eastern Sea, while Zhou lay to its west. At that time, the Old Master was in Zhou, and Confucius resided in Lu, so he pointed to that direction, alluding to his virtue and extolling his sagacity—this was surely no deception.

Later generations mistakenly identified him as the Buddha. Yet by that time, the Buddha had long since passed away, and his language and script differed from those of China. What would Confucius have gained from him? Moreover, Confucius distinguished the Central States from the barbarians, despising those with unkempt hair and left-lapelled robes. According to the principles of the *Spring and Autumn*, those who adopted barbarian rites were demoted. Would he have abandoned the sages of China to study and revere them?

In ancient times, King Wen resided beneath Mount Qi, where he was known as the Earl of the West. King Wu said, “It was my cultured father who became illustrious in the Western Lands.” Zhou lay in the west of China, so it also referred to itself as the West.

When Boyi and Shuqi dwelled in Guzhu, they admired King Wen’s sagely virtue and said to each other, “We have heard there is a man in the West who seems to possess the Way. Let us go and observe him.” They then traveled to the southern slopes of Mount Qi.

The *Book of Songs* says:
*“For whose grace do we long?
The fair one of the West.
That fair one—
The man of the West.”*
This is from the “Airs of Wei.” Zheng’s commentary states it expresses longing for the Zhou court.

Again, Qi Jiang said to Duke Wen of Jin, “The books of the West contain this: ‘If the sun and moon do not remain in their places, who can attain peace?’” This too is from the *Book of Zhou*.

Examining the ancient references to the “West,” they invariably point to Zhou. Guzhu was a state in the west of Liaoxi, while Lu, Wei, and Qi were eastern feudal lords. Thus they all referred to Zhou as the West, never extending the term to the far reaches beyond the Flowing Sands.

As for the Yin-Yang masters who speak of certain spirits and baleful influences residing in the West, they refer to the space within walls—how could they mean distant lands?

Moreover, when Confucius traveled south to Pei and met the Old Master, the Old Master called him a worthy of the North—how could this refer to the lands of the Xiongnu or the like?

In the second year of King Lie of Zhou, the Old Master passed through Qin. Duke Xian of Qin heard of this and went out to the suburbs to welcome him, providing lodging and offering ritual inquiries. He said, “Our humble state is remote and isolated, and I am unworthy. Yet you have graced us with your presence. I dare not trouble you with matters of military campaigns, but may I inquire about the celestial reckoning?”

The Old Master said, “How could an old man like me know such things?”

The Duke said, “I wish to hear it. Please do not decline.”

The Old Master said, “Qin originally united with Zhou but later separated. After five hundred years, they will reunite. Seventy years after that, a hegemon or king will emerge. Beyond this, it cannot be foretold.”

The Duke was pleased and said, “I wish you would stay a while longer so that I may serve as your disciple.”

The next day, the Old Master departed without taking leave and exited through the Hangu Pass.

During the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the Old Master returned east and traveled with Master Yin and others to Mount Meng in the Red City of Shangyu. He revisited the abode of the Great Emperor of Fusang, where he assembled the host of immortals. Later, he concealed himself in Mount Jingshi of Luoyang.

At that time, five yellow-haired old men—some riding cranes, others clad in feathers, holding staffs of green bamboo—gathered to discuss the reckonings of heaven and earth. No one in the world recognized them.

The Old Master composed scriptures totaling a hundred thousand words. Beside him stood two divine beings, holding a golden flask filled with ink as thick as lacquer. When the ink was sprinkled on wood or stone, it formed seal and clerical script.

Wang Jia’s *Record of Forgotten Tales* states: “Once, the Old Master resided on Mount Jingshi and discussed the reckonings of heaven and earth with five old historians, composing scriptures totaling a hundred thousand words. Two divine beings from the kingdom of Futi emerged with a golden vessel containing ink as thick as lacquer. When sprinkled on wood or stone, it formed seal and clerical script. When the ink in the golden flask was exhausted, the two wished to refine their hearts and distill their blood to replace it.”

The five elders were the Five Heavenly Emperors of Indra. Mount Jingshi is Mount Taishi.

During the reign of King Zhao of Qin, the Old Master journeyed with Perfected Lord Yin and various immortals through the mountains of Nüji, Difei, and Tianzhu. They then exited westward through the Hangu Pass, crossed the Flowing Sands, ascended Kunlun, returned to the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity, and finally came back to the homeland of the Supreme Mystery. When the king heard of this, he regretted not having witnessed it and ordered the construction of cities and towns at the western foothills where the Old Master had passed, to mark the sacred proximity. Today, the Old Master’s Pavilion and Post Station and Yin Xi’s City remain, their ancient ruins still extant.

King Xiaowen of Qin hunted between Ba and Han and personally visited the Louguan Terrace to pay homage and offer sacrifices. In the tenth year of King Nan’s reign, the cyclical year *bingshen*, the Old Master dispatched envoys to summon the recluse Shen Xi. Xi, originally from Wu Commandery, had studied the Dao in Western Shu and was able to relieve the suffering of others. One day, while traveling with his wife, Madam Jia, to visit their daughter-in-law, Zhuo Kongning, they encountered a procession on the road: one dragon carriage, one tiger carriage, and one white deer carriage, each drawn by a team, with a grand retinue of crimson-robed attendants bearing insignia. They asked Xi, “Are you the scholar-recluse Shen Xi?” Startled, Xi replied, “Yes.” The riders said, “Scholar, your hidden merits have benefited all beings, and your heart has never forgotten the Dao. From youth to now, your conduct has been flawless. The Yellow Thearch and the Old Master have now sent immortal officials to welcome you. The one in the white deer carriage is Attendant Gentleman Bo Yan; the one in the azure dragon carriage is Transcendent Lord Sima Sheng, Master of World-Transcendence; and the one in the white tiger carriage is the Welcoming Envoy Xu Fu.” In an instant, three feather-robed immortals bearing tablets presented Xi with a white jade register, its borders of blue jade and its characters of cinnabar, inscribed with red script. The Attendant Gentleman of the Azure Vault then carried Xi away to ascend into heaven. At the time, farmers working the fields all witnessed this. Soon, a great mist arose, and when it dispersed, only Xi’s oxcart and ox remained

Amidst the resonant clanging of bronze and iron, the four walls radiated a luminous glow, inscribed with writings. The Old Master stood over ten feet tall, his body emanating a dazzling brilliance too bright to gaze upon directly. He commanded a Jade Maiden to hold a golden tray bearing a jade cup filled with elixir, which he bestowed upon Xi, saying, “This is the divine cinnabar—those who drink it shall not die.” Each received a single *daogui* measure. They were instructed to drink in silence, bow without offering thanks, and were then given two dates, each as large as a chicken’s egg. The Old Master further presented Xi with a talisman and a single scroll of immortal methods, saying, “For now, return to the mortal realm to relieve the suffering of others. If you wish to ascend again, hang this talisman at the tip of a pole, and I shall dispatch envoys to welcome you.” With these words, Xi suddenly felt as though he had fallen into a deep sleep, only to awaken upon the earth.

Empress Dowager Dou, afflicted with illness, once sent envoys to summon Xi. He remained among mortals even into the reign of Emperor An, but later ascended to heaven once more. The First Emperor of Qin built a shrine to the Old Master south of the Louguan Terrace, endowing it with temple households. He personally composed an invocation, which read:

*“The Great Dao flows boundless,
Ever near to left or right.
When the Old Master departs, he wanders west;
When he returns, he glances east.
I now attend to Penglai and Yingzhou—
May your response be swift as echo or shadow.”*

The First Emperor performed the rites himself, and suddenly, the Old Master descended before his seat. Overcome with awe and joy, the emperor prostrated himself repeatedly, entreating the Way with utmost reverence. The Old Master smiled but made no reply, instead bestowing upon him the *Guilin Sutra* and talismans for commanding ghosts and spirits. The emperor pleaded incessantly, yet the Old Master vanished in an instant. The First Emperor returned in disappointment, though the invocation he had composed remained preserved in writing.

*Compiled by the Song Dynasty Master of Observing Revival, the Eminent Scholar Xie Shoubin*

The Old Lord, pitying the decline of the Zhou and the growing corruption of customs, divided his body to dwell in the world and save the age. He returned near the banks of the Shan and Yellow Rivers, concealing his name and lineage. People thus called him the Old Man of the River, or the River Master.

He once transmitted the Dao to An Qisheng, who later passed it to Ma Mingsheng. Ma Mingsheng taught Yin Changsheng, who in turn taught Master Er Zhu. Thereafter, none knew to whom it was further transmitted. Ma Mingsheng was also recorded as originally surnamed He, styled Junxian. While serving as a county clerk capturing bandits, he was gravely wounded and near death when he encountered the Perfected Lady of Supreme Truth, who revived him with medicine. Junxian, feeling indebted, begged to serve her, hoping only to learn her method for treating sword wounds, unaware she was an immortal. After years of diligent service, the Lady, seeing his reverence and that his spirit remained as vigorous as before, said to him: "The Dao I practice cannot be transmitted except to lofty perfected ones; it is not something to teach beginners. An Qisheng possesses the method of the Golden Fluid and Returning Elixir. Tomorrow he will come, and I shall entrust you to him. Following him for long, you will attain the Dao." The next day, An Qisheng indeed arrived, and the Lady commended Junxian to him. Junxian followed An Qisheng, serving him for nearly twenty years before receiving the oral instructions for the elixir. After refining and ingesting it, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Yin Changsheng, a kinsman of Empress Yin of the Later Han, was fond of the Dao from youth. Hearing that Ma Mingsheng had attained the Dao of transcending the world, he served as his bondsman for over a decade. Mingsheng did not teach him the Dao but only discussed mundane matters. Of the twelve who served alongside him, all grew resentful and left, save for Yin, whose reverence only deepened. Mingsheng then told him: "You alone are truly fit to receive the Dao." He erected an altar, cut a covenant in blood, and transmitted to him the oral instructions for the divine elixir. Later, on Mount Pingdu in Zhongzhou, Yin refined and ingested the elixir, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. In his own preface, he wrote: "In the first year of *Yanguang* of the Han, north of Xinye Mountain, I received the essential instructions for the divine elixir. Having attained the Dao and departed the world, I concealed myself in the famous mountains. Should any obtain this, they shall be ranked among the perfected and move freely between past and present. Why seek the common world’s method for immortality? The essence lies in the divine elixir. Practices such as circulating qi, guiding and pulling, bending and stretching, or consuming herbs and plants may extend life slightly but cannot eternally transcend to become a divine immortal. If you wish to hear it, this is the essential teaching: it is the fruit of accumulated study, not the work of spirits. Superior scholars strive diligently; inferior ones laugh, deeming it impossible. Those who know the divine elixir shall enjoy enduring vision and eternal existence." Thereupon, he inscribed three copies of the elixir scripture on yellow silk and golden tablets, concealing one each in Mount Song, Mount Hua, and Mount Sui. Another copy on silk he entrusted to his disciples, to be transmitted through the generations.

An Qisheng also separately transmitted the Dao to Mao Xigong, who taught Le Xiagong, who taught Le Jugong, who taught Master Gai. According to the *Records of the Historian*: "Among the clan of Yue Yi was Le Jugong, who was skilled in cultivating the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. His original master was the Old Man of the River, though his origins were unknown." The Old Man of the River taught An Qisheng, who taught Mao Xigong, who taught Le Xiagong, who taught Le Jugong, who taught Master Gai. Master Gai then taught in Gaomi and Jiaoxi, becoming the master of Chancellor Cao of the Han. It is also said: "In the first year of Emperor Hui’s reign, Cao Shen governed Qi. He summoned all the elders and scholars to ask how to pacify and unite the people. The scholars, numbering in the hundreds, each gave different answers. Unsure whom to follow, Cao heard that Master Gai was skilled in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and sent a messenger with generous gifts to invite him. Master Gai expounded that governing the Dao valued clarity and stillness, so the people would naturally settle. Expounding further, Cao adopted his methods and governed Qi for nine years, bringing peace and unity to the state."

Emperor Wen of Han and Empress Dowager Bo both favored the teachings of *Laozi*. They decreed that all princes and ministers must recite and study it. The *Records of the Historian: Biographies of Confucians* states: "Emperor Wen favored penal statutes and names; Emperor Jing demoted Confucian teachings; Empress Dowager Dou favored the Yellow Emperor and Laozi." The *Book of Han: Biographies of the Imperial Relatives* states: "Empress Dowager Dou favored the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, but Emperor Jing and the imperial relatives were not permitted to esteem them." Given this, it was Emperor Jing who favored them, so why is Emperor Wen mentioned? Perhaps the Empress Dowager’s preference also stemmed from Emperor Wen’s own fondness.

Ban Gu’s *Postface to the Biography of Yang Xiong* states: "Lao Dan composed two chapters on emptiness and nothingness, disparaging benevolence and righteousness, rejecting ritual and learning. Yet later generations who favored him esteemed it above the *Five Classics*. Even Emperors Wen and Jing of the Han spoke thus, though Emperor Wen’s preference for *Laozi* was not as fervent as his regard for penal statutes and names." He frequently sought and dispatched recluses to interpret its meaning. Someone reported: "By the riverside lives an old man, whose name no one knows. He is called the River Master and recites the two chapters of the *Daodejing*." The emperor heard this and sent an envoy to inquire about the scripture’s purport. The old man said: "The Dao is honored, virtue is noble; this cannot be asked from afar." The emperor then personally visited him. Descending from his carriage with utmost reverence, the emperor found the old man sitting arrogantly in a thatched hut. Undeterred, the emperor said: "All under heaven is the king’s land; all within the seas are the king’s subjects. Among the four great things in the realm, the king is one. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject. Why not humble yourself? Why so haughty?" The old man clapped his hands and laughed, leaping tens of feet into the air, halting in the void. Looking down, he replied: "Above, I do not dwell in heaven; in the middle, I am not burdened by men; below, I do not reside on earth. What subject am I?"

The emperor then realized he was a divine being and immediately prostrated himself in reverence, bowing his head in apology: "I, with my meager virtue, have inherited the ancestral legacy. My talents are small for so great a task, and I fear I am unworthy. Though I govern worldly affairs, my heart is ever devoted to the Dao and virtue. Only through ignorance have I failed to perceive proper ritual. I humbly beg the Dao Lord to instruct me."

The old man then bestowed upon the emperor two volumes of plain silk scriptures, saying: "Study these deeply, and your doubts will resolve themselves. There is no need for further discourse." He continued: "Since I composed these texts, over seventeen hundred years have passed. They have been transmitted to only three others—now including you, four in all."

As he finished speaking, clouds and mist gathered on all sides, and heaven and earth darkened. The old man vanished without a trace.

This account appears in the *Records of the Grand Historian* and Ge Hong’s *Traditions of Divine Transcendents*. Today, the temple of the River Earl stands north of Shan Prefecture, along with Emperor Wen’s Terrace for Gazing at Transcendents, both still extant.

The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states that the River Earl rose into the void and departed amid mist, though some dismiss this as fanciful. They argue that if Laozi expounded the scripture during the reign of King Zhao of Zhou, fewer than seventeen hundred years would have passed by the time of Emperor Wen, making the claim impossible. However, Bian Shao’s *Stele Inscription for Laozi’s Ancestral Hall* asserts that Laozi had served as teacher to emperors since the time of Fuxi. The *Inner Traditions* records that he was a teacher during the reign of Shun, known as Master Yin Shou, and composed the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue*—thus, its antiquity is well established. Though Yin Xi requested Laozi to write the text, why could Laozi not have revisited his own ancient teachings?

The two volumes of plain silk scriptures the old man bestowed are none other than the authentic *Scripture of Dao and Virtue*. Having received such radiant grace, the heart and spirit awaken of themselves—what need is there for further explanation?

The *Laozi* commentary attributed to the River Earl in later times is likely a misattribution by later scholars, who mistook the author for the commentator and thus falsely ascribed it to him. Liu Zhiji of the Tang, in his *Three Teachings Pearl Grove*, also stated that there is no commentary on the *Laozi* by the River Earl. Before the Qin and Han dynasties, classical texts were never annotated—how much less so for the Way, which is said to be "easily known"? Why would one need to add explanations oneself?

Emperor Wu of Han, fond of the Dao and enamored of transcendence, frequently worshipped at famous mountains, hoping for an encounter with immortals. Yet his ceaseless military campaigns and insatiable desires betrayed his aspirations. Laozi then commanded the Queen Mother of the West and the Upper Prime Lady to descend together into his court, assessing his sincerity and instructing him according to his capacity.

The Queen Mother said to him: "If you wish to cultivate yourself, you must first nurture your qi. The *Perfect Scripture of Great Transcendence* speaks of the Way of Increasing and Transforming: 'Increasing' means augmenting essence, and 'Transforming' means altering form. One who can both increase and transform is recorded in the registers of highest transcendents; one who fails in both will not escape death and calamity.

To practice the Way of Increasing and Transforming, constantly contemplate the Numinous Treasure. 'Numinous' is spirit, and 'Treasure' is essence. You need only refine your essence and solidify your qi. Qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into fluid, and fluid into marrow. Practice this tirelessly, and spirit and essence will overflow.

In the first year, you will augment your qi; in the second, your blood; in the third, your essence; in the fourth, your vessels; in the fifth, you will transform your marrow; in the sixth, your sinews; in the seventh, your bones; in the eighth, your hair; and in the ninth, your form. When your form is transformed, you will undergo metamorphosis; through metamorphosis, you will attain the Dao; and attaining the Dao, you will become a transcendent."

The Upper Prime Lady said to the emperor: "Do you truly love the Dao? I hear you have frequently summoned masters of esoteric arts, sacrificed to mountains and rivers, and worshipped at sacred altars—your efforts have indeed been diligent. Yet your diligence has not borne fruit, and there is a reason for this.

Your inborn nature is violent, lustful, extravagant, cruel, and predatory. These five traits are the saws and knives that sever your body, the axes and hatchets that cleave your life. Though you profess a desire for longevity, you cannot cast aside these five faults. Your labors are in vain, bringing only minor benefits to sustain yourself.

From this day forward, cast off these five natures and return to gentleness and goodness. Be clear in your duties, attentive to those below, broaden your thoughts, and cultivate generosity. Show compassion to the poor and orphaned, lighten taxes, and cherish your body. Constantly perform hidden virtues, rescue those in peril, and deliver the dying from calamity. Abandon lust, nurture your spirit; forsake extravagance, embrace utmost frugality. Diligently observe fasts, moderate your diet, sound the Heavenly Drum, drink Jade Nectar, bathe in the Flowery Pool, and strike the Golden Beam. Practice these disciplines, and there may yet be hope."

She then dispatched her attendant, Ji Luorong, to Mount Fu Guang to seize the Azure Perfected Youth and obtain the *Divine Flying Methods of the Six Jia from the Left and Right*, a text composed by the Supreme One of the Three Heavens, intending to bestow it upon the emperor.

The Azure Perfected Youth reported back: "A Chang said he received your instruction and, responding to the Mother’s summons, visited the household of Liu Che. I did not expect the Celestial Numinous One to descend into such foul impurity. I wonder how you have been faring of late?"

Ji Luorong arrived and said: "The Venerable Mother wishes to obtain the twelve sections of the *Golden Book of Secret Characters*—the *Divine Flying Methods of the Six Jia Spirits from the Left and Right*—to bestow upon Liu Che. I have sealed one copy to deliver as a token."

Yet A Chang continued: "Though Che has the heart for it, he is no transcendent’s material. Should we not fear that these teachings will be leaked to a mere walking corpse? Recently, in the emperor’s presence, I have heard many speak thus: 'Mountain ghosts wail in the thickets, lonely souls howl in distant lands. Armies are raised, and clans are rewarded for merit, yet the toil of war is forgotten, and white bones lie abandoned. The common folk are harassed, and cruelty runs rampant. The Supreme One has already made his crimes manifest, and resentment is visible in the heavens. Clamor fills the air—he will certainly not attain transcendence.'

I dare not disobey your command."

The Queen Mother laughed and said: "Many speak thus of this man, but the emperor need not be entirely dismissed."

Those who earnestly aspire to the Dao of transcendence must cultivate sincerity and focus their thoughts, observe fasting to reflect on their transgressions, and thereby eliminate a hundred faults. By restraining the self and returning to goodness, honoring the true spirits, and preserving authenticity while guarding unity, one may, in a single month, erase a thousand faults. Che has long yearned for the Dao, his heart ever diligent; he has repeatedly prayed at sacred mountains, seeking deliverance. Weighing his merits against his faults, they nearly balance. Yet from this day forward, he must diligently refine his resolve and sincerity, heed the words of the Lady of Primordial Yang, and no longer indulge in extravagance, cruelty, or tyranny—lest the multitudes suffer and perish, and the wronged souls of destitute ghosts raise cries of desecration, while the blood-soaked dead are forgotten despite their meritorious deeds.

Then the Lady rose, grasping a jade tablet inscribed with phoenix patterns, and, gazing heavenward, intoned: "The Nine Heavens stretch boundless, Mount Tai radiates its numinous power; the spirits illumine the subtle and profound, the pure and void shine bright. Those who refine their essence attain marvels, those who guard their qi attain life. When devotion to the Dao reaches its peak, stillness evokes the true, and accomplishment follows. To exhaust the spirit and debase the form is to invite disgrace; to calm the essence is to preserve youth and flourish.

She bestowed upon Che the *Lingfei* scripture, along with the Six Ding Talismans for summoning the attendant spirits of the Celestial Radiance, by which one may tread the void, conceal one’s form, attain longevity, and preserve vision—restoring youth and retaining vitality. Should he violate or disclose these teachings, calamity will swiftly overturn him; should he defy the celestial truth, he will surely sink into the depths of darkness. Let him beware of disaster—I dare to admonish you, Liu Che."

Having spoken thus, the Lady plucked forth the ritual implements she had bestowed and displayed them. The Queen Mother of the West then conferred upon him the *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The Emperor bowed to receive it and, with a jeweled casket, enshrined it within the Pavilion of the Ministering Beam.

For six years after receiving the teachings, the Emperor felt his spirit and qi clear and unbound, believing himself visited by divine transcendents and certain of attaining transcendence. Relying on this, he neglected to cultivate utmost virtue, instead constructing palaces and pavilions, exhausting the myriad people, and ceaselessly waging war—so that the roads swelled with lament and resentment. By the eleventh month, day *yi-you*, of the first year of the *Tai-chu* era, heavenly calamity struck the Pavilion of the Wutong Beam. The *Chart of the True Forms*, the *Lingfei Scripture and Record* in twelve scrolls, and all fourteen volumes of his own received and composed texts—along with their caskets—vanished entirely. Though he repeatedly entreated the Queen Mother, she never descended again.

In the eighth month, day *ren-chen*, of the second year of the *Tian-han* era, the Venerable Lord once more dispatched Wei Shuqing to meet the Emperor. At the time, the Emperor was idly residing in his palace hall when suddenly he beheld a figure in feathered robes and star-crowned cap, riding a cloud-borne chariot drawn by white deer. Startled, he asked who it was, and the figure replied: "I am Wei Shuqing of Zhongshan." The Emperor said: "If you are indeed a man of Zhongshan, then you are my subject—come forward and speak with me." Shuqing suddenly vanished without a trace. The Emperor deeply regretted this and immediately dispatched the Minister of Liang to Zhongshan to seek him out. Though he could not be found, the minister brought back his son, Du Shi, to meet the Emperor.

The Emperor asked: "Where is your father now?"
Du Shi replied: "My father has long been devoted to the Dao of transcendence, shunning worldly affairs. He abandoned his family and departed forty years ago, saying he would enter Mount Taihua."

The Emperor then sent Liang Bo with Du Shi to Mount Hua to search for him. At the foot of a sheer cliff, they beheld Shuqing playing a game of *bo* with several companions upon the rock, enveloped in purple clouds, with a forest of white jade and several transcendents holding pennants and staffs standing behind them. Du Shi gazed upon them and bowed twice. Shuqing asked: "Why have you come?"
Du Shi replied: "The Emperor deeply regrets that he was unable to speak with you the other day. He has now sent the emissary Liang Bo with me, wishing to see you again."
Shuqing said: "Previously, I was sent by the Most High to inform him of the great calamity’s time and the methods to avert peril and extend the dynasty’s fate. Yet he, arrogant and self-exalting, failed to recognize the true Dao and instead sought to make me his subject. Unworthy of such discourse, I departed. Now I must join with the Central Yellow and Grand Unity to stabilize the celestial mandate. I shall never return."

Liang Bo returned and reported this. The Emperor regretted it deeply.

The Grand Historian Sima Tan was especially versed in the Way of Laozi. In his *Essential Pointers of the Six Schools*, appended to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, he wrote: "The Daoists enable one to unify the spirit and act in accord with the formless, suffusing the myriad things. Their teachings proceed by following the great harmony of yin and yang, adopting the virtues of the Confucians and Mohists, and distilling the essentials of the Logicians and Legalists. Adapting to the times and responding to things, they establish customs and enact affairs—nothing is unsuitable. Their principles are concise and easy to grasp; their affairs few, yet their achievements many.

Those who follow yin and yang make one constrained and full of fears; the Confucians are broad but lack essentials, laboring much yet achieving little; the Mohists are frugal but difficult to follow; the Legalists are stern but lack benevolence; the Logicians are overly exacting and prone to losing the truth. Only the teachings of Laozi are called the Great Way: 'Act through non-action,' and 'There is nothing that is not done.' In practice, it is easy; in discourse, it is hard to know. Taking emptiness and non-being as its root and following along as its function, it forms no fixed patterns and has no constant shape, thus able to succor the conditions of the myriad things. It does not precede things, nor does it follow them, and so can be the master of the myriad things. With method yet without method, acting in accord with the times; with measure yet without measure, harmonizing with things. Worthiness and baseness become self-evident; black and white take form. Whatever one desires to employ, what affair cannot be accomplished? Thus it accords with the Great Way, blending in profound obscurity, illuminating the world, then returning to non-illumination.

What gives rise to people is the spirit; what it relies upon is the form. When the spirit is overused, it is exhausted; when the form is overtaxed, it decays. When spirit and form separate, death ensues. The dead cannot be revived; the separated cannot be rejoined. Thus the sage values them. From this perspective, the spirit is the root of life, and the form is its vessel. Without first stabilizing the spirit and saying, 'I have the means to govern the world,' how can it be done? Therefore, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi come before the Six Classics."

From the *Records of the Grand Historian*.

The *Han Dynasty Bibliographic Treatise* states: "The Daoist school grasps the essentials and holds to the root, preserving purity and emptiness, maintaining humility and weakness—this is the art of the ruler facing south."

Zhao Rong and Ouyang Xiu, in the *Comprehensive Catalogue of the Chongwen Library*, wrote: "The Daoist school is rooted in purity and emptiness, abandoning vigor and desire, maintaining a tranquil self-possession. Thus it says: 'I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves.' Though the sage faces south to govern, this cannot be altered. Yet some fail to fathom its root, casting aside benevolence and righteousness to return to spontaneity, taking 'following along' as its function—this the Confucians criticize."

In the fifth year of the *Chu-yuan* era of Emperor Xiao-yuan, on the third day of the fourth month, day *ding-chou*, the Venerable Lord, by the command of the Heavenly August Emperor, bestowed upon the transcendent Mao Ying a divine seal and jade tally. Ying, styled Shushen, was a native of Nanguan in Xianyang. Born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing’s reign, day *bing-shen*, at the age of eighteen he abandoned his family to study the Dao. He entered Mount Chang to gather mushrooms and herbs for sustenance, constantly reciting the *Dao De Jing* and the *Book of Changes*. After six years, hearing that the Perfected King of the Western City was accomplished in the Dao, he went directly to seek him as his teacher. Scaling lofty peaks and traversing perilous terrain, braving brambles and dangers, he finally encountered him and served as his attendant for seventeen years, never daring to slacken. The Perfected King made Ying responsible for managing his robes, books, charts, and silk cords.

Three years later, the Perfected King took Ying with him in a nine-canopied carriage to the White Jade Tortoise Terrace to pay homage to the Queen Mother of the West.

The Perfected King bowed deeply and withdrew. The Queen Mother of the West said, "Perfected One, you now bring a mortal with you to ascend the numinous terrace—is this not laborious?" The Perfected King smiled but did not answer. Then, glancing at Ying, he rose to bow and request esoteric essentials. Ying kowtowed twice and said, "This humble one, a lowly and base creature, a remnant of withered bones, dares to seek the span of accumulated moons with the fleeting quality of a morning mushroom. Thus, I have endured the perilous depths of dark forests, coveting the life bestowed by my teacher. The Perfected King, pitying my arduous path, has granted me the essentials of bodily cultivation and the method of absorbing qi. Now, my teacher deigns to instruct me further—ought I not seek greater benefits from the *Book of Changes*? Who could have foreseen that today I would encounter such an august presence? I humbly beseech the art of eternal life, to awaken this walking corpse."

The Queen Mother bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*, along with the *Mystery of the Supreme Ultimate and the Perfected True*. After three years of practice, the Perfected King further granted him a dose of the Ninefold Cyclically Transmuted Elixir, saying, "Your Dao is now accomplished; you may return. Later, you shall be entrusted with immortal office in the lands of Wu and Yue." Ying then took his leave and returned to serve his parents. In his hometown, those who had died unjustly—even those long buried—were all commanded by the Earth Bureau to be restored to life.

He remained at home for fifty-three years, living in obscurity. After both his parents passed, he observed mourning rites with proper decorum. His two younger brothers, Mao Gu and Mao Zhong, both served in the Han court. Gu became the Grand Administrator of Wuwei, and Zhong the Grand Administrator of Shangjun; they assumed office on the same day, and the carriages and horses of those seeing them off filled the roads. By then, Ying had already received the Perfected King’s secret decree regarding his ascension. He privately told those bidding farewell, "Though I shall not hold office as a *erqian shi*, I too shall have a divine appointment. Next year, on the third day of the fourth month, will you all come to visit as you do today?" The crowd joyfully agreed.

In the fourth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Chuyuan* reign, this came to pass. The following year, those seeing him off gathered as promised, their numbers several times greater than before. On that day, the Lord Lao, by the command of the Celestial August Emperor, dispatched the Embroidered-Robe Envoy of the Hidden Realm Palace, Ling Guangziqi, to confer upon Ying the divine seal and jade insignia. The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity likewise sent the Left Palace Attendant of the Three Heavens, Guan Tiao, to bestow upon him an eight-dragon brocade chariot and a robe of purple feathers. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao dispatched the Harmonious Dawn Gentleman, Shi Shumen, to present Ying with the Golden Tiger True Talisman and the Flowing Gold Bells. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Orthodox Unity Supreme Mystery Jade Gentleman Wang Zhong, and Bao Qiu, among others, to grant him the four-jointed Swallow’s Embryo, the Flowing Brightness Divine Mushroom, the Ever-Shining Numinous Flying Night-Glowing Cave Herb, bidding him to bow, consume them, fasten the seal, don the robe, straighten his cap, face north with the talisman girded, and stand grasping the bells.

The four envoys addressed Ying: "He who consumes the four-jointed Hidden Mushroom of the Great Ultimate shall be ranked as a Perfected Minister. He who consumes the Jade Mushroom Swallow’s Embryo of the Golden Watchtower shall be ranked as Director of Destinies. He who consumes the Flowing Brightness Golden Bloom of the Eastern Palace shall be ranked as Director of Records. He who consumes the Ever-Shining Numinous Flying Herb shall be ranked as Perfected Earl. He who consumes the Night-Glowing Cave Herb shall oversee the duties of the Left and Right Censors. You have consumed them all—your lifespan shall equal that of heaven and earth, and you shall become the Director of Destinies, Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Marchmount. You shall govern the gods and immortals of the Wu and Yue regions, and command the mountain sources of the lands east of the Jiang."

With these words, the envoys departed. In an instant, the Lords of the Five Directions each descended in chariots of their directional colors, accompanied by their retinues, to receive the Celestial August Emperor’s decree. They bestowed upon Ying the register of Director of Destinies and Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, adding the Nine Bestowals. The plaque was carved from purple jade, inscribed in yellow gold, its text reading:

*"Of Ying’s nature, void and distant, limpid and bright, he has from youth been steeped in the profound and mysterious. From his earliest years, he let his hair loose upon the northern mountains, calming his heart amid forests and marshes, refining his essence in pursuit of the divine. Ascending peaks and traversing valleys, he arduously sought the gates of his masters, casting off form and severing ties, offering his body to the ten thousand fords. His cinnabar sincerity, unconstrained and natural, followed the course of heaven."*

Thereupon, he sought out master artisans and was granted the sacred writ. He sheared his hair and swore solemn vows, severed his locks and mutilated his body, girded himself with rope and rejoiced in solitude, unashamed of hunger and cold. Wherever he went, he followed only the Dao; what he preserved was his true nature. His sincerity shone before the August Emperor, moving the Great Mystery to deep emotion.

Thus, he is now invested with the rank of Grand Primordial Perfected, assuming the office of Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Director of Destinies. With a heart level and upright, he holds fast to his resolve as to metal and stone. His cinnabar heart outshines the multitude; his spirit abides in lofty radiance. In recompense, he is granted the Jade Mace and Green Pennant of the Eight Might, that he may subdue the sources of rivers and marshes, overawing the ten thousand spirits.

Through frost and snow in forests and valleys, he savored the mysterious and gazed upon the true. His thoughts stirred within secluded peaks; his heart’s sincerity was revealed. In recompense, he is granted the Purple Yak-Tail Standard and the Lotus-Blossom Crown of Splendor, that he may summon and command the myriad spirits, seal mountains, and call forth clouds.

Abandoning his home, he journeyed alone, leaving kin to delight in immortality. He endured hardship and tempered his resolve, winter-bare upon the mountains and rivers. In recompense, he is granted the Embroidered Feather Robe and Vermilion Flying Sleeves, that he may ascend the celestial stairs with ease, embracing his mandate among the Jade Perfected.

Treading deep marshes and scaling perilous cliffs, his heart remained steadfast in its aspirations, never faltering in fear. In recompense, he is granted the Mottled Dragon Chariot and White Tiger Cushion, that he may roam and feast in the vast heavens, soaring to the imperial court.

Pushing through brambles to merge with the light, enduring cold and frost, his heart sought the radiant Perfected, unwavering and unafraid. In recompense, he is granted the Curved Spirit Canopy and Jade Pavilion, that he may wander and gaze through the Nine Palaces, his spirit serene in warmth and secrecy.

Rejecting profit and fleeing glory, his heart knew no weariness. Concealing his form in secluded peaks, he meditated in stillness amid the myriad forests. In recompense, he is granted the Flowing Gold Fire Bells and Twin Pearl Moonlight, that he may ascend to the Great Ultimate and communicate his voice to the Upper Clarity.

With a heart pure and lofty, he remained untouched by excess or defilement. Unadorned and luminous, his inner and outer being were level and smooth. In recompense, he is granted the Brocade Banner and Embroidered Banner-Staff, that he may summon the Six Yin Jade Maidens to attend his chariot.

His kindness extended to all things; his hidden virtue nurtured the myriad beings. Even the tiniest creatures were the object of his care. In recompense, he is granted the Phoenix and Luan Pipes, the Golden Bell and Jade Chime, that he may harmonize his spirit in the empty halls, delighting the Perfected and dancing with the spirits.

Hunger and thirst nurtured his spirit; hardship and toil sought the true. The myriad things could not sway his resolve; a thousand evils could not corrupt his purity. Thus, he is bestowed the Purple Grove’s Riches and Jade Nectar of Golden Infants, that his lifespan may equal the Three Luminaries, his name inscribed upon the Cinnabar Jade Tablet.

His bearing led the pure and mysterious; his purple weft illumined the eight directions. His heart blazed with double fire; his spirit leapt in the great auroras. Truly the eldest among the Perfected, he is thus styled Grand Primordial. His nine virtues now complete, he has moved the accumulated essence of the Great Tenuity. Heaven and humanity, in empty whiteness, converge without design. Thus, nine recompenses are granted to requite his past devotion.

His heart and spirit now aligned with his aspirations, the Four Numinous Ones find their abode. His cinnabar sincerity shines forth; his grasp of the true remains unshaken. Upright and steadfast, his mirror reflects even the subtlest details. Thus, he is appointed Prime Minister of the Supreme Ministry, overseeing the Eastern Marchmount, and further charged with the office of Director of Destinies, to manage the registers and records. He is assigned forty Jade Lads and forty Jade Maidens to attend him in his comings and goings from the Great Tenuity, where he receives his duties at the Great Ultimate. His administrative palace is the Vermilion City Jade Grotto. Let him govern with diligence and report all matters, great and small.

At the age of one hundred and two, having received his mandate, he mounted his dragon chariot and turned to address those present:

The true Dao conceals its traces, never seeking outward display. Yet in my present actions, I dazzle the eyes and ears—this I do to entice and encourage my two younger brothers, that they may follow and emulate me, and further, that all under heaven with hearts inclined toward the Way may know its direction.

My two brothers, upon hearing of my departure, may resign their offices and abandon their emoluments to seek me out. For now, I shall temporarily reside on Mount Juqu east of the Jiang River.

Having spoken thus, he ascended his feathered chariot. Banners and canopies billowed in dense array as he harnessed dragons and tigers, floating away into the void. His two brothers, upon learning of his ascent to immortality, both abandoned their posts and returned home. In the first year of *Yongguang*, they crossed the Jiang to seek him on Mount Juqu. He taught them the method of transforming withered bones into flourishing life. The two brothers practiced with utmost diligence, and after twenty-four years, he further petitioned Lord Wang to bestow upon them the Nine-Turned Returning Elixir. Having ingested it, they attained the Dao.

In the third year of *Yongshi* of Emperor Cheng, the *dingwei* year, he led his two brothers to the Golden Gates, where they petitioned the Sage Lord to receive the scriptures. Thereupon, the Supreme Lord dispatched a messenger from the Vermilion Palace to present the Purple Writs to Lord Zhong, saying:

*"The Writ of the Supreme Heavenly Perfected states: Mao Gu of Xianyang, dwelling at the Southern Pass, styled Jivei, is destined to attain immortality and hold the position of Registrar of Destinies, concurrently overseeing the earthly perfected. He is charged with recommending those of the Dao, for their lifespans are intertwined with his. Wherever he governs with reverence, the laws of the four extremities shall be upheld. His administrative palace shall be the Terrace of the Vermilion Terrace, governing Mount Juqu in Danyang. Let him be diligent in his duties and report all matters, great and small."*

It further stated: *"Zhong and his younger brother Zhong, though late in returning to rectitude, possess pure and comprehensive talents. Their thoughts are subtle yet their sincerity is thorough, cutting off the deceptions of the Six Heavens. Their brilliance stands out clearly. Now they are appointed to oversee the Three Offices of Life-Preservation, establishing their names and governing Mount Tai. They shall record life and death, holding the rank of Earthly Immortals. As luminaries of the Nine Palaces, they shall exhort and instruct the young, guide those who are nearly perfected, teach and train the female officials, transmit wondrous numina, govern the hundred spirits, supervise the refinement of essences, inspect the sources of waters, regulate the flows of rivers and seas, seal and guard the golden valleys, keep the registers of jade liquors, oversee the planting of dragon mushrooms and cavern herbs, and the radiant night grasses. Their governance shall be at Mount Liangchang, at the mouth of the Northern Cavern, guarding the gates of the Yin Palace."*

When the messenger had finished delivering the writs, Zhong and his two brothers took leave of the Golden Gates and returned to their place of governance.

In the second year of *Yuan Shou* of Emperor Ai, the *gengshen* year, on the eighteenth day of the eighth month, the *jiyou* day, the Lord of Destinies took leave of his two brothers, saying: *"Now I depart to assume my duties and shall no longer visit you frequently. However, on the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month each year, be sure to invite my master and the Supreme Numinous Red Perfected of the Southern Marchmount to visit this mountain. Those who are devoted to the Dao shall await me here, and I shall surely instruct them."*

Thereupon, he and Lord Wang mounted their chariots together and departed for the Vermilion City Jade Grotto.

Old traditions record that the Lord of Destinies received his investiture and ascended in flight only after his two brothers received their writs at the Golden Gates, but I privately suspect this account is in error. For instance, when he ascended Mount Juqu in his feathered chariot, bearing the purple-tasseled staff, accompanied by hundreds of civil and military officials—how could this have occurred before receiving his mandate? If he ascended in the *jiwei* year, how could he have led his two brothers to the Golden Gates?

In the second year of *Heping* of Emperor Xiaocheng, the *jiawu* year, Lord Lao manifested himself and descended, wandering by the Quyang Abyss in Langye Commandery. Today, in Guizhou, there is Mount Quyang with the Divine Han River; in Dingzhou, there is also Mount Quyang with the Divine Han River; in Haizhou, there is Quyang City, north of which lies the Feathered Pool; in Shouzhou, there is Quyang City and the Northern Han River. Gan Ji and his disciple Guan Chong were both from Langye, and their activities took place in Quyang of Haizhou.

At that time, a man of Beihai named Gan Shi (later changed to Ji), devoted to the Dao, suddenly contracted a severe illness. For over a decade, no medicine could cure him. Morning and night, he burned incense and lamented to Heaven, praying for deliverance. Lord Lao, moved by his sincerity, sent the immortal Bo He to pose as an old medicine-seller in the market. Gan Ji approached him, and Bo said: *"If you truly wish to be cured, come at cockcrow tomorrow to the north of the great bridge, beneath the magnolia tree by the Ye Ford. There I shall teach you the method to cure your illness."*

At cockcrow the next day, Gan Ji went to the place, but Bo had already arrived. Angrily, he said: *"If you do not wish to be cured, leave. Come again at midnight."* Thereupon, Gan Ji arrived at the first watch and waited long until Bo appeared. He produced two scrolls of plain silk, bound with blue heads and vermilion eyes, titled *The Blue-Headed Writs of Peace*. Handing them over, he said: *"This is the* Taiping Jing *of the Supreme Lord Lao. By obtaining this scripture, you shall not only be cured of your illness but also attain longevity and transform the world."*

Gan Ji bowed and received the scrolls, leaping with joy and moved to tears. His illness was instantly cured. Lord Lao descended again and personally instructed him in its essentials. He then compiled the previous scriptures into one hundred and seventy scrolls.

As recorded in the *Book of the Later Han*: *"Initially, during the reign of Emperor Shun, Guan Chong of Langye presented at court, offering the divine scriptures his master Gan Ji had obtained by the waters of the Quyang Abyss—one hundred and seventy scrolls, all on silk, with vermilion borders, blue heads, and vermilion eyes, titled* The Blue-Headed Writs of Peace*. It was said that Ji had personally received them from Lord Lao. These are the* Taiping Jing *of the Daoist tradition."*

The scripture is divided into ten sections according to the ten celestial stems: *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *wu*, *ji*, *geng*, *xin*, *ren*, and *gui*, each section containing seventeen scrolls. *Piao* refers to bluish-white silk, and *su* to fine silk, bordered in vermilion. *Dao* denotes the headings, and *mu* the titles.

The *Taiping Jing* states: *"In my scriptures, the good are all marked with blue heads and vermilion eyes, aligning with my Dao—this is the trust of vermilion and blue. Blue represents life, benevolence, and the heart. Red represents the Great Yang, the true color of Heaven."* Gan Ji grasped its essentials and thereafter cultivated his body and nurtured his nature, dispelling disasters and curing illnesses—all without fail.

The essentials state: *"When a person is born, Heaven bestows upon them spirit, Earth bestows upon them essence, and the harmonious center bestows upon them [qi]. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and guard the Mysterious, within they will attain longevity, and without they will bring the realm to Great Peace."*

It further states: *"A minister’s conduct should be to love their ruler above all. Those who desire long life—if they are children—should think of their parents, fearing their aging, and guide their intentions toward the Dao, constantly seeking rare formulas and extraordinary arts to serve their lord and kin. As disciples, they should remember their masters’ grace, for though one is born of parents, it is through masters that virtue and power are perfected, and through rulers that honor and glory are attained. Ever mindful that their lord, father, and master will age, and having no means to repay them, they should study further and serve the worthy, seeking rare formulas and wondrous methods to benefit them. Such are the most loyal ministers, filial children, and obedient disciples of the Highest Antiquity and August Sovereign. If all people act thus, the world will attain Great Peace."*

*"Those with heart do only good, their words and deeds sincere and substantial. They examine themselves strictly, purify their hearts, and reform their conduct. Moved by this, those above bestow Heaven’s grace, and they, in turn, express gratitude and remain steadfast without ceasing, thereby attaining immortality."*

The formula states: *"My character ‘eleven’ is named ‘Scholar.’ *Bing-wu* and *ding-wei* are the ancestral beginnings. Four mouths govern affairs and the principles of all things. The ‘Child’s Turban’ uses the horn to govern the right. The ‘Hidden Dragon’ must not be employed—*kan* corresponds to *si*. Those who behold it live long. Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, one merely lives, but governing a hundred thousand people, immortality awaits. Those who skillfully cure illness need not seek recompense. There is no joy like the Long Peace Market, making people’s lives as long as the Queen Mother of the West, akin to the four seasons cycling endlessly. Ninety characters and strategies are transmitted to the fangshi. These divine elixirs and marvelous strategies may be offered to one’s lord, father, and master."*

Furthermore, [the scripture] expounded the regulations and precepts for *jijiu* (libationers) and entrusted them to Gan Ji. Thereafter, Ji revered the scriptures, practiced the Dao, and disseminated them among his disciples, establishing male and female officials to broadly transform the people, drawing followers from all directions.

In the second year of *Yuanhe* during the reign of Emperor Zhang of the Later Han, the Lord Lao descended again and admonished Ji, saying: *"I previously transmitted the Dao to you to assist the state and sustain life, worrying for the myriad people. Yet of late, male and female disciples have usurped my titles, coveting wealth, indulging desires, acting arrogantly, envying the worthy, and obstructing talent, engaging in mutual slander—none of this is as it should be. Thus, I have come to speak with you."*

Ji prostrated himself, touching his head to the ground a hundred times, and said: *"Yes, yes! May the Most High pardon past transgressions and permit this servant to cultivate future goodness. From this day forward, I know not how to save the male and female disciples from their misfortunes."*

The Lord Lao said: *"Listen well, listen well! Though a person may live ten thousand years, without upholding the precepts, what difference is there from ancient wood or enduring stone? Better to die as a person of virtue and power for a single day while upholding the precepts than to live in violation of them. Those who uphold the precepts supplement the celestial offices and ascend as *shi jie* immortals. Though worldly people may be kings, dukes, or even emperors, if they commit grave sins, it avails nothing for their souls and spirits. How can this not be grievous? Clearly uphold my precepts to instruct them."*

Thereupon, he expounded one hundred and eighty precepts. Having finished, he further told Ji: *"The immortals and sages of ancient times all attained the Dao through this. The Dao is originally formless; it is perfected through the master. The Dao must not be abandoned, nor the master slighted."*

Ji bowed deeply, received the command, and expressed his gratitude with repeated bows.

According to the *Biography of Pei Kai* in the *History of the Later Han*: Kai, during the reign of Emperor Huan, again memorialized, saying: *"Formerly, Gong Chong presented divine books that focused on revering Heaven and Earth, taking the Five Phases as their foundation. They also contained methods for strengthening the state and increasing descendants, their texts being easily understood and aligning with the classics. Yet Emperor Shun did not implement them, and thus the imperial line did not flourish."* Kai’s words were often forthright and direct, but the emperor did not adopt them.

The *Commentary of Crown Prince Zhanghuai* cites the *"Rise of Emperors and Kings"* chapter of the *Scripture of Great Peace*, which states: *"A perfected person asked a divine person: ‘I wish to enable emperors and kings to swiftly attain Great Peace. May I hear how?’ The divine person replied: ‘Simply follow the Way of Heaven and Earth without losing their distinct divisions, and Great Peace will be swiftly attained.’*

*‘*Yuanxi’ has three names: Great Yang, Great Yin, and the Harmonious Center. Forms have three names: Heaven, Earth, and Human. Heaven has three names: sun, moon, and stars, with the North Pole as the center. Earth has three names: mountains, rivers, and level land. Humans have three names: father, mother, and child. Governance has three names: ruler, minister, and people. If these three constantly support one another as if of one mind, not losing even the slightest measure, sharing the same concerns and uniting as one family, Great Peace will be swiftly attained, and longevity will be unquestionable."*

When Emperor Ling ascended the throne, he deemed Kai’s words correct. The Grand Mentor Chen Fan recommended Kai as *fangzheng* (upright and principled), but he did not accept the appointment. His hometown revered him, and whenever a new governor arrived, he would be the first to pay respects.

During the *Qingping* era, he was summoned along with Xun Shuang and Zheng Xuan (or Zheng Yuan) as *boshi* (erudites), but he did not go.

Fan Ye’s commentary states: The ancients said, "He who speaks well of Heaven must have verification in man." Zhang Heng likewise declared: "Astronomy, calendrical calculations, yin-yang divination, and prognostications—these are what we must urgently attend to today." Only men like Lang Yi and Pei Kai could look up to observe the heavens and look down to examine the earth, correlating them with human affairs. When fortune and misfortune, good and ill omens duly manifested, they drew upon them to clarify moral teachings. This is how the unfolding of the Dao/Way proved beneficial to the age, and what later generations should take as their measure.

Ji Hou later took up residence in Kuaiji. When Sun Ce pacified the Jiangdong region, seeing that the people revered Ji as a divine being, he invited him to be a guest and kept him in his army. Many officers and soldiers fell ill with epidemics, but whenever Ji spat water upon them, they would recover. The officers and soldiers all venerated Ji, bowing to him each day before paying their respects to Sun Ce. Enraged, Sun Ce arrested Ji and reproached him, saying: "Heaven has long been parched, and the waterways are dry. Yet you sit idly in your boat, playing the sorcerer, bewitching my officers and soldiers and disrupting my ranks. Today I shall do away with you." He bound Ji and exposed him, demanding that he summon rain. "If you can move Heaven to send a great downpour by midday, I shall pardon you. If not, you will be executed." Soon clouds gathered, and rain poured down in torrents. Sun Ce nevertheless put Ji to death. His officers and soldiers wept, wishing to recover his body for burial, but suddenly his corpse vanished. Soon after, Sun Ce was wounded by assassins sent by Xu Gong. Gazing into a mirror, he saw Ji’s reflection. Sun Ce cried out in terror, hurled the mirror away, and died as his wound burst open. Ji continued to move among people for over a hundred years before ascending as an immortal.

The above account is not sourced in the *Yuan* registers; it is briefly recorded in the *Preface to the Scripture of Great Peace* and the main text of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

In the third year of the *Yongchu* era of Emperor An, on the *jiyou* day of the second month (Year of the Rooster), the Venerable Lord descended upon Mount Tai. He dispatched the Mount Tai emissary Ya Yu with chariots and cavalry to summon Liu Tu, a virtuous scholar of Jiangxia, intending to have him collate and verify the registers of all under Heaven. When Tu arrived, he saw the Venerable Lord seated facing south upon the throne. The Most High resided in the east, facing west; the Nine Heavens’ Immortal Lords resided in the south, facing north; and the Eight Poles’ Heavenly Lords resided in the west, facing east. The Venerable Lord commanded Tu and his officials to collate and verify the names and karmic registers of all under Heaven, completing the task in three days. Wishing to show Tu the retribution of sins and blessings, the Venerable Lord ordered Ya Yu to lead Tu into the earthly prisons. They passed through eighty-one hells, where Tu saw his father suffering in torment. Upon emerging, he pleaded with the Venerable Lord on his father’s behalf, and the Venerable Lord commanded his release. Ya Yu then led Tu to the heavenly realms, where he beheld the Golden Terrace and Jade Palace within the Great Clarity Palace. Music arose spontaneously, and many immortals, clad in azure robes and holding golden tablets, chanted and recited scriptures. After the tour, Tu was sent back. Through this experience, he attained the Dao/Way, became a Daoist priest, and later ascended as an immortal.

This account appears in the *Rhapsody on the Sage’s Chronicle in the Tang History* and the *Yingyuan Diagram*.

In the first year of the *Han’an* era of Emperor Shun, on the fifteenth day of the first month (Year of the Horse), the Venerable Lord descended upon Mount Heming in Shu, where Zhang Ling was cultivating the Dao/Way. Riding a cloud chariot and attended by a host of immortals, he summoned Zhang Ling before him through divine messengers and said: "Your ancestor Zhang Liang accumulated merit and virtue, bestowing blessings upon his descendants. Your destiny is to become a Daoist priest." He then bestowed upon Zhang the newly revealed *Secret Registers of the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might*, instructing him to sweep away the residual darkness of the Six Heavens and purify the world through transformation. He also taught him the methods of paying homage to the sun and moon, and the techniques of the *High Ascent* and *Yuyi* and *Jielin* rituals, commanding him to practice them. From then on, the people flocked to him as their teacher, and his disciples numbered in the tens of thousands. When the people suffered from illnesses or official calamities, they would offer rice, silk, cloth, hemp, miscellaneous utensils, paper, brushes, firewood, and the like to atone for their sins. They would also submit written confessions of their transgressions, repent, and swear never to repeat them, whereupon their misfortunes would dissolve. Thus, the people all delighted in following him, and none dared to do wrong.

At the outset, his successor was named **Dao-ling**, styled **Fu-Han**, born in the fifteenth day of the first lunar month of the *jiawu* year (10 CE) during the reign of Emperor Guangwu’s *Jianwu* era, in the Tianmu Mountains of Yuhang. At the age of seven, he could recite the *Dao De Jing*. Later, he became a scholar, mastering the Five Classics and well-versed in the writings of the *He* and *Luo* Rivers, as well as celestial patterns. In the second year of Emperor Zhang’s *Yuanhe* era (*yiyou*, 85 CE), he was summoned as a *boshi* (erudite) but declined the appointment. At fifty-two, he declared that Confucian learning was of no benefit to longevity and lamented: *"How fleeting is human life! Old age and death draw near, and I cannot endure the suffering of life and death again."* He then dispersed his disciples and pursued the Dao of long life, retreating to Yunjin Mountain—now known as Longhu Mountain in Xinzhou.

In the fourth year of Emperor He’s *Yongyuan* era (*renchen*, 92 CE), he was appointed *Jianyidafu* (Remonstrating Grand Master) but declined due to illness. The emperor again summoned him with a third-rank seal and cord, a four-horse carriage, and the title of *Taifu* (Grand Tutor), enfeoffing him as Marquis of Jixian. Dao-ling told the envoy: *"Convey my gratitude to the Son of Heaven: in the Nine Heavens above, in the realm of Nothingness, the Golden-Portal Lord of the Imperial Palace—I have already become his subject. Only through purity and restraint can the world govern itself. What need has it of me?"* He then withdrew to Mount Song, where he fasted, meditated on the Dao, and constantly recited the *Dao De Jing*. After nine years of cultivation, his sincerity moved Lord Lao, who dispatched a divine messenger to inform him: *"Within the stone chamber of the Central Peak lie the ancient celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns, the* Huangdi Jiuding Great Elixir Scripture*, and the* Five Marchmounts True Forms Map*. You may go and receive them."* Entering the stone chamber, he indeed obtained the celestial treasures and the *Huangdi Jiuding* elixir methods. However, his family had long been poor, lacking the means to refine the elixir. Hearing that the people of Shu were simple and teachable, and that the region abounded in famous mountains, he led his disciples into Shu and secluded himself on Mount Heming.

There, he encountered Lord Lao, who provided the necessary ingredients. Following the method, he refined the elixir for three years. Upon its completion, he dared not consume it, telling his disciples: *"The divine elixir is now ready. If I take it, I shall ascend to become a Perfected. Yet I have not rendered great service to the world. I must first eliminate harm and promote benefit for the state, aiding the people, before I consume the elixir, ascend lightly, and serve the Three Realms—lest I feel remorse."* Soon after, Lord Lao sent the Pure Harmony Jade Maiden to teach him the method of exhaling and inhaling pure harmony. After a thousand days of practice, he could inwardly perceive his five viscera and outwardly gather the myriad spirits. He then took three steps and nine strides, treading the Dipper and the Qian trigram, wielding his power to subdue demonic forces wherever they manifested. He battled the demonic lords of the Six Heavens, seized the Twenty-Four *Zhi*, transformed them into blessed precincts, and renamed them *Huayu* (Realms of Transformation), demoting their former masters to the rank of *yin* officials.

Previously, tens of thousands of demonic spirits in Shu had roamed freely, holding markets in broad daylight, spreading plagues, and afflicting the people for generations. After the great demons of the Six Heavens were subdued, Dao-ling banished their hordes to the barren lands of the northwest. He swore an oath with them: *"Humans rule by day, ghosts by night. Yin and yang are distinct, each with its own domain. Those who violate this shall face the laws of the* Zhengyi*, and be punished without mercy."* Thus, the realms of the living and the dead were separated, and their paths diverged. To this day, the "Ghost Market" at Qingcheng in western Shu, along with the stele of Dao-ling’s oath to the spirits and the celestial and terrestrial stones bearing the sun and moon, remain. The oath stipulated that the spirits could only emerge when heaven and earth aligned and the sun and moon shone brightly.

On the first day of the fifth month, Lord Lao descended again, bestowing upon Dao-ling the following scriptures: nine scrolls of the *Taiqing Zhongpian Jingmu*, thirty-six scrolls of the *Jinye Danjing*, twenty-four scrolls of the *Taiqing Zhongjing* and *Shizhong Miyao*, the *Xuannü Mimiao Jing*, *Suzhen Jing*, *Shiyin Jing*, *Jiuding Bianhua Lianzhen Xuandong Zhi Fa Kaiming Dajing*, *Yuce Shanji Tulu*, *Shanhai Dajie Heluo Tuchen*, the inner and outer *Huangting*, the inner and outer *Taiqing*, *Yuce Youjing*, *Wuxing Jingwei Dongjing Muyu Jing*, *Tianjing*, *Dijing*, *Mingjing*, *Shanjing*, the *Bianjing Jing*, *Hejing Neishi Jing*, *Jiutian Yuanpu*, *Jiutian Yuan Dongjiu Zhen Zhongjing*, *Wulao Baojing*, *Danjian Heilu*, *Shangxia Zhaipin Jiewen*, *Taiyi Jinye Jing*, *Zhenyi Shouxuan Jing*, *Sanyuan Zhongtai Suling Zhongjing*, *Jinque Dijun Qingtong Neijing*, *Dongxuan Zhenjing*, *Sanhuang Neiwen*, *Xuanhua Sidao Chengbai Guan Jie*, *Sanwu Feibu Chengxuan Jing*, *Jiashan Tu*, *Mingjin Dilu*, and the *Gui Li Zhufa*—totaling nine hundred and thirty scrolls—as well as seventy scrolls of talismans, making one thousand scrolls in all.

Lord Lao further commanded Dao-ling to attend his dragon-drawn chariot to the Seven-Treasure Terrace of Kunlun’s Banfeng and Jincong. There, the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord was in residence. Lord Lao presented Dao-ling to pay homage, whereupon the Jade Lad was dispatched to bestow upon Dao-ling the seal and cord of the Celestial Master, entrusting him with the governance of the twelve hundred officials. He also granted him the male and female swords, the *Eryi Jiaotai* crown, the *Quxie Qi*, the *Yulie* robe, talismans, registers, contracts, and commandments, along with scriptures and precepts, charging him to assist the state, protect destiny, nurture life, and suppress evil.

After the rites, Dao-ling returned. In the first year of *Jiankang* (*jiashen*, 144 CE), the Celestial Master moved to Mount Yuntai in Guizhou. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month, Lord Lao descended once more, bestowing upon him the *Zhengyi Mengwei Jing*, the secrets of the Three Actions and Six Penetrations, the scriptures of the Three Caverns, and the methods of the two seasonal fasts, all revealed through the celestial characters of the *Lingbao Wupian* as the essential and wondrous scriptures.

Now proclaiming the teachings to the ten directions’ celestial and human beings: on all *jiazi* days, *gengshen* days, the eight seasonal nodes, the Three Primes, the Five La Festivals, and the Three Assemblies, all must bathe, fast, and maintain abstinence, offering sacrifices, reciting invocations, and praying to atone for transgressions, erase entries from the Black Registers, and perform the rites of the Nine Ancestors’ Merit Feast. The above is recorded in the *Biography of the Celestial Master* and the *Illustrated Records of Shu*.

In the second year of *Jianhe* (*wuzǐ*, 148 CE), on the seventh day of the first month, the Celestial Master took Zhao Sheng as his disciple. Twelve divine maidens descended, transforming a bitter spring into a salt well. Later, the commandery was named *Ling* to commemorate his merit, and it was later renamed *Xianjing* Salt Well, now known as Longzhou.

In the first year of *Yongshou* (*yǐwèi*, 155 CE), on the seventh day of the first month, Lord Lao descended again, commanding the Celestial Master to travel together to Chengdu. Lord Lao rode a dragon chariot, while the Celestial Master mounted a white crane, alighting amidst five-colored clouds at the site where the Jade Maiden of Taihao refined the elixir. Earth spirits surged forth, jointly bearing a jade platform over ten feet high to serve as a sacred seat. There, Lord Lao expounded the methods of the Northern Dipper for excising death and inscribing life. By the fifteenth day, he further revealed the Southern Dipper’s powers of refining the hun-soul and forging the po-soul. The *Scriptures of the Northern and Southern Dippers* were later composed by the two attendant perfected ones, Shu and Mi, based on these events.

After Lord Lao departed, the jade platform remained, sinking into the earth to form a well, now located within the inner city of Chengdu, called the Jade Platform Abbey. Later, they traveled to Lutang Mountain, where Lord Lao bestowed upon the Celestial Master the *Texts for Subduing the Six Heavens and Beheading Demons*.

In the third year of *Yongshou* (*bǐngshēn*, 157 CE), the Celestial Master was one hundred and twenty-three years old. On the ninth day of the ninth month at noon, Lord Lao dispatched envoys of the Five Emperors bearing jade tablets, descending upon Mount Yuntai to confer upon him the title of *Zhengyi* Perfected One. Soon after, five-colored cloud-dragons arrived to welcome him, and together with his disciples Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, he ascended to heaven. This is recorded in the preface to the *Scriptures of the Northern and Southern Dippers*.

In the eighth year of *Yanxi* (*yǐsì*, 165 CE), on the *jiazi* day of the eighth month, the Emperor dreamed of Lord Lao descending in a jeweled canopy chariot to the palace courtyard. He then dispatched envoys to offer sacrifices at his birthplace in Ku County of Chen Commandery. The Emperor ordered Bian Shao, the Chancellor of Chen, to compose an inscription, which read:

Lord Lao served as the Keeper of Archives for Zhou, and during the reign of King You, when the Three Rivers trembled, he admonished the ruler with the lessons of Xia and Yin’s decline, using the principles of yin and yang. Confucius, born in the twenty-first year of King Ling of Zhou, studied ritual with Lao Dan. Calculating his age, Lao Dan was already over a hundred when Confucius sought his instruction. One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Grand Scribe Tan of Zhou was identified as Laozi, though none knew his ultimate fate. His two-chapter work declares that the reason heaven and earth endure is that they do not live for themselves. From the dawn of humanity, bodies have succeeded one another, and the meaning of life and death is thus evident. Some speak of the "valley spirit that does not die," referring to the mysterious female, and from this, later seekers of the Dao expanded upon it, asserting that Laozi’s separation and union with the primordial qi marked the beginning and end of the Three Luminaries. Observing the heavens, he crafted prophecies, ascending and descending with the Dipper stars, changing nine times with the sun, waxing and waning with the seasons, measuring the Three Luminaries, with the Four Spirits at his side. By visualizing the cinnabar field and the Purple Chamber of the Great One, the Dao is perfected, immortality achieved, and one sheds the mortal coil to transcend the world. Since the eras of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, he has served as the teacher of sages.

Ban Gu, however, claimed that Laozi "abandoned sagacity and rejected knowledge," calling ritual the root of chaos, and thus diverged from Confucius. In his *Han History’s Table of Ancient and Modern Persons*, he applied standards to rank Laozi below Confucius, grouping him with Zixi of Chu. These two assessments differ greatly—such is the saying: "Those whose ways differ cannot make plans together."

In the eighth year of *Yanxi*, on the *jiazi* day of the eighth month, the Emperor, revering virtue and magnifying the Dao, embracing vastness and brilliance, cultivating spirit and nurturing nature, with aspirations to soar among the clouds, turned his heart toward the Yellow Emperor and emulated the example of Gaozong, dreaming of Laozi and honoring him with sacrifices. At that time, Bian Shao, the Chancellor of Chen, oversaw the state’s rites. Though his talent was modest and his thoughts shallow, unable to fathom the perfected one or distinguish right from wrong, he relied on written records to assert that Laozi embraced emptiness, guarded stillness, delighted in namelessness, upheld non-virtue, shunned high office, and found peace in lowly positions. He left Confucius with words of benevolence, fled the world to live in seclusion, changed his name and surname, and feared being recognized.

The sun marks time by brightness and darkness, the moon completes itself through waxing and waning. The origins of growth and decline, the gates of fortune and misfortune—heaven’s way despises fullness and favors humility. Thus, Laozi’s exaltation in the present and the sacrifices offered to him by the people of this age stem from his fleeing emolument and dwelling in obscurity, diminishing himself again and again, manifesting the purity of emptiness and non-being, existing before heaven and earth, preserving authenticity and nurturing nature, thereby attaining the Five Blessings.

With reverence, I compose and inscribe this, its words reading:

Ah, the mysterious power,
Embracing emptiness, guarding purity.
Delighting in lowly positions,
Holding office without scheming.
As a plumb line, it straightens;
Bent, it can coil.
Facing the Three Rivers,
He vented his grievances and scattered his indignation.
Perceiving the moment, he acted,
Waiting at the suburbs, he emerged radiant.
The fortune of reclusion,
Fleeing the world, concealing his name.
Holding to the One without fail,
Bringing peace to all under heaven.
Dwelling in thickness, not thinness,
Abiding in substance, containing glory.
Taking models as weighty,
Gold and jade as light.
Cutting off desires, abandoning cravings,
Returning to infancy.
Vastly traversing the ages,
None knew his true nature.
Essentially, through non-action,
Great transformation is accomplished.
Advancing and retreating without constancy,
Interweaving constancy within.
Taking knowledge as ignorance,
Empty yet not full.
The measure of the great man,
Beyond the judgment of the ordinary.
The ninth-rank scholar,
How could it burden his name?
Shining like the sun and moon,
Aligned with the Five Stars.
Entering and exiting the cinnabar chamber,
Ascending and descending the Yellow Court.
Turning his back on the vulgar,
Discarding splendor, concealing his form.
Enveloping the primordial, transforming spirit,
Inhaling and exhaling the purest essence.
The world could not fathom him,
Knowing neither his life nor death.
Celestial and human ranks offer sacrifices,
Illuminating his numinous power.
Admiring his extended years,
I carve this stone to honor him.

In the twelfth month, the Emperor again dispatched the Palace Attendant Guan Ba to Ku County to offer sacrifices to Lord Lao. In the ninth year, he constructed the Zhuolong Palace within the Fanglin Garden, designating the literary chamber as an altar. He adorned it with pure gold clasps and sounding vessels, arranged a seat beneath a floral canopy, and employed the music of the suburban sacrifices. The Emperor personally worshipped Lord Lao, with the Buddhist figures of the Floating Image tradition as co-recipients of offerings. This is recorded in the *Book of Later Han*.

According to the *Account of the Western Regions* in the *Book of Eastern Han*: the kingdom of Tianzhu, also called Shenyin Gandhara, practiced the Dao of the Floating Image. During the reign of Emperor He, envoys were sent to offer tribute. By the second year of Emperor Huan’s Yanxi era, in the fourth month, they frequently arrived from beyond Rinan to present offerings.

Legend holds that Emperor Ming dreamed of a towering golden figure with a radiant halo around his neck. When he inquired of his ministers, one replied that in the West there was a deity named Buddha, whose form stood sixteen feet tall and shone like gold. Thereupon, the Emperor dispatched envoys to Tianzhu to inquire about the Buddha’s Dao and law, and had his image painted in China.

In the second year of Emperor Ling’s Guanghe era, on the first day of the first month of the year *jiwei*, Lord Lao commanded the Heavenly Emperor of the Nine Heavens to descend with the Three Caverns Dharma Master Xu Laile and others upon Mount Tiantai. Lord Lao rode in an eight-scene jade chariot, accompanied by ten thousand attendants, with the Orthodox Unity Perfected One in attendance. Lord Lao styled himself the Supreme Primordial Unity Perfected One, and appointed Zhen Dingguang as the High Mystery Dharma Master of the Cavern Scripture. He ordered the Jade Gentleman of the Immortal Attendants, Wang Sizhen, to unfurl the Nine Radiance Jade Report and present the *Cavern Mystery Great Cavern Numinous Treasure Scripture* in thirty-six sections to the immortal Ge Xuan, along with two grades of Upper Clarity purification rites.

The first was the secluded fast, where one severs worldly ties, cultivates stillness, and models the deportment of the void—entering sageliness and ascending emptiness. The second was the pure altar fast, where one reverently follows the true rites: first delivering the nine ancestors, then one’s household, and finally oneself.

These were the three registers and seven grades of purification rites: the three registers were the Gold Register fast, which harmonizes yin and yang and safeguards the nation’s destiny; the Jade Register fast, which protects empresses, consorts, dukes, and noble clans; and the Yellow Register fast, which delivers the nine lineages and seven ancestors, forever freeing them from the suffering of eternal night.

The seven grades were: the Sun Illuminating Perfection fast, which transcends the departed and resolves all karmic entanglements; the Sun Natural fast, which universally seeks blessings for sentient beings, atones for transgressions, and cultivates the Dao for immortality; the Three Primes fast, which atones for violations of precepts and resolves judgments before the Three Officials; the Eight Nodes fast, which repents the sins of one’s ancestors and oneself, erasing the Black Record; the Cavern Spirit fast, which values purity and simplicity as the highest, seeking immortality and protecting the nation; the Instruction fast, which esteems clarity and plainness, curing illnesses and averting calamities; and the Mud and Charcoal fast, which values austerity as merit, repenting transgressions and seeking blessings.

Along with these, he bestowed the *Sutra of the Wheel of Admonition and Precepts* in forty-five scrolls, the *Boundless Penetrating Mystery*, the *Turning Spirit into Samadhi*, and other scriptures upon Ge Xuan, charging him to propagate them in the world.

He declared: "You should constantly contemplate the Highest Great Dao King of the Vacuous Perfected One, the Lord of the Great Thousand Worlds, known as Laozi, who is the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. Ge Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, was born in the seventh year of Emperor Huan’s Yanxi era, on the eighth day of the fourth month of the year *jiachen*. His father, Ge Han, served as a Secretary. When Xuan was born, a certain Zhi Daoji, a master of the lofty Dao, said to his father: 'Yesterday, I heard that the Master of Penetrating Mystery descended from the Great Canopy Heaven. Your family shall become the patriarchs of divine immortals—this child is no ordinary one.'

His father replied: 'The transformations of immortals are unfathomable. I would be content if he merely lived a long life as my heir.'

Xuan grew up refined and intelligent, his nature and understanding exceptionally bright. He perused all the classics, masters’ works, philosophers, and histories without exception. At the age of fourteen, having lost both parents, he suddenly sighed: 'The world possesses an eternal, deathless Dao—why not study it?' Thereupon, he wandered to renowned mountains, seeking out extraordinary persons. Ingesting the essence of mushrooms and trees, he received the *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquid* from the immortal Zuo Ci.

Xuan diligently observed the purification precepts, excelled in healing illnesses and exorcising ghosts, and practiced breath control and guiding exercises. Through concentrated meditation on the Dao, he moved Lord Lao to descend personally and bestow upon him scriptures and methods. He also revealed the celestial court’s decrees on the karmic conditions of worldly beings, namely the *Tract on Response and Retribution*. He further said: 'When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. With surplus goodness, one descends seated upon a cloud chariot. Ceaselessly propagating the Dao, one attains deathlessness.'

Xuan bowed his head in reverence and gratitude.

Today, at the Tongxiang Abbey on Mount Tiantai, the site of the Dharma Wheel Courtyard where the Three Perfected Scriptures were transmitted, as well as the Interrogation Altar built by the immortal lord’s spirit laborers, still remain.

On the first day of the tenth month of the second year of Sun Hao’s Chiwu era, the day *jiazi* at noon, Lord Lao commanded the Heavenly Emperor of the Nine Heavens to present the Golden Tablet of the Supreme Three Heavens, bestowing upon Xuan the title of Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate. The decree read:

'Ge Xuan of Jurong County in Danyang Commandery of Yangzhou: in past lives, you practiced austerities, accumulated merit over kalpas, sacrificed your body in almsgiving, and rescued those in peril. You turned the wheel of the sacred realm, refined spirit and preserved essence, exhausted your will in the source of the Dao, and served your master with reverence. Your diligent cultivation was unceasing, deeply moving the Supreme. Your name is inscribed in the Mysterious Capital, and your rank is fixed among the Upper Immortals. Thus, your wisdom and intelligence were born into a virtuous lineage. Your talents are jade-like and refined, your fragrance like orchids in bloom. Your celestial disposition is transcendent and outstanding, towering above the crowd. Your Daoist counsel is profound and majestic, unmatched among your peers. You renounced worldly glory, embraced simplicity, and upheld authenticity. You focused your heart on the true immortals, embraced the primordial and guarded the One. You let your hair loose in the forests and mountains, dwelling in a cliffside abode. Delighting in the mountains and forests, you contemplated the lotus blossoms. You fasted past noon, never missing a day of purification. You burned incense and recited scriptures, never neglecting your bows and rites. With a compassionate heart, you delivered others, tirelessly working for their salvation. Your will pursued the subtlest traces, and the great Dharma was thoroughly mastered. You taught both the wise and foolish, explaining all without exception. Humble and amiable, you always wore a joyful countenance.'"

Now bestowed upon you are crimson brocade robes, skirts of flying silk, celestial feathered garments, a lotus-dawn crown, the Golden Perfected Divine Tiger Staff, and the command of demonic maidservants—whatever you will, you may summon the seas and call forth the mountains.

For your profound studies of hidden scriptures, your long fasts and quiet contemplation, your focused and unwavering dedication, you are now granted the Eight Radiance Jade Chariot, to ride dragons and mount the clouds, with a halo of light encircling your neck, and golden seals with jade inscriptions, to repay your past virtues. Thus shall you be of the Daoist gate for generations to come. May later worthies look up to you, upholding the Dharma-wheel. The Most High’s venerable teachings are expounded by the Three Heavens.

Your embodiment of virtue is vast and far-reaching; you instruct and transform both Daoists and laity, universally aiding all beings. Your great attainment of wondrous enlightenment has earned you a name among the lofty perfected, and even the mighty demons submit in reverence. O towering sage, radiant and majestic, your grace fills the ten directions, and all beings attain their desires. Now you are bestowed the rank of Most High Jade Capital Supreme Left Immortal Lord, overseeing the officials and retinues of the Six Heavens and the Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms. You are granted five hundred jade lads and five hundred jade maidens as attendants, bearing in your left hand the incense and flowers of the Nine Luminaries, and in your right the *Supreme Cavern Mystery Scriptures* of the Most High. With two thousand dragon-riders, you shall roam the Nine Palaces of the Upper Clarity, thrice a year ascending to the Golden Towers of the Jade Capital in the Supreme Mystery Metropolis. The Most High confers this mandate, and the Heavenly Emperor receives the decree to carry it out. Proceed according to the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens.

At that time, the śramaṇas Śākyamuni’s disciple Daowei and Zhu Falan, having heard from afar of the Immortal Lord’s attainment, came to seek him as their teacher. They bowed and inquired: “We have heard that the Dao has no before or after, no past or present. We wonder whether the Most High Lord Lao and Prince Siddhārtha’s paths are the same or different.”

The Immortal Lord replied: “In essence, there is no distinction of high or low, noble or base, form or name.”

Thereupon, he established an altar on Mount Tiantai and transmitted to Daowei and Falan the *Chart of the Five Sacred Peaks’ True Forms*, saying: “This is the token of the Most High’s command. Carry it as you travel to the famous mountains of the eight directions, and the Three Realms shall welcome you.” He also bestowed upon them the *Most High Golden Elixir Scripture*, the *Five Spontaneous Treasures of the Numinous Jewels*, the *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writ of the Great Existence*, the *Celestial Master’s Golden Book of Jade Characters*, and other texts totaling ten scrolls, along with a stalk of *taiji* dragon-script magic fungus. He charged the immortal officials to wear them on their persons and commanded his chamber disciple Zheng Siyuan to impart the oral instructions in full. He further gifted them a grain of immortal medicine, enabling them to abstain from grains and forsake the five flavors, so they might wander freely among the famous mountains.

Daowei and the others, having received the sacred scriptures and divine medicine, felt neither hunger nor thirst. They wished to remain a while longer to serve the sagely master, but the Immortal Lord said: “If your heart holds me, I shall always be visible to you. There is no need for attachment. You should ascend Mount Song; after five years, the perfected ones of that mountain will transmit to you the secret instructions, and your Dao shall be accomplished.”

The Immortal Lord once remarked to the various Confucians discussing the classics: Zhang Zhao asked, “‘Transmitting but not creating, trusting and loving the ancients, I humbly compare myself to Old Peng’—what is the meaning of this?” The Immortal Lord replied: “Laozi expounded the Dao of spontaneity, transforming the world, while Confucius journeyed through the states, extending benevolence to the people. Their ultimate aim is one and the same.”

Taizi Deng once asked the Immortal Lord: “Zhuangzi said, ‘Beyond the Six Directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss; within the Six Directions, the sage discusses but does not debate.’ Why is this?” The Immortal Lord replied: “Within the Six Directions, bound by forms, images, and the reckonings of yin and yang, one may still make inquiries. Beyond the Six Directions, where human sight rarely reaches, in the vastness beyond the void, the sage refrains from discourse, hence ‘acknowledges but does not discuss.’” Deng praised this answer.

In the *jiazi* year of the seventh cycle, at the age of eighty-one, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Most High commanded his attendants to ride dragon-unicorns, bearing the Nine Radiance Staff and the Cloud Banner, harnessing nine dragons and the Eight Radiance Cloud Chariot, with canopies of blossoming shade and banners of dragon maidens and tiger flags, to welcome the Immortal Lord. The Immortal Lord reined in his cloud steed, halting his chariot in the Great Void, and composed three five-character poems to leave behind for the world.

The first:
*The perfected of old left teachings,*
*Moved by those lost in doubt.*
*Those who reject the Dao for heresy*
*Bring calamity upon themselves.*
*When the body dies and the name perishes,*
*What regret can there be?*
*Great sins cannot be absolved;*
*Who shall purge this poison?*
*In the unseen, the time of emergence is unknown;*
*Only when the kalpa ends may it cease.*
*Reincarnated in poor and lowly families,*
*Some become servants again.*
*With senses impaired or incomplete,*
*They beg in the marketplace like broken jade.*
*Unaware of the retribution for accumulated sins,*
*They blame the gods and resent Heaven.*
*The Great Dao is ever non-action;*
*Its vastness begins with goodness.*
*Now I, towering and revered,*
*Have earned this through my deeds.*
*The Three Realms bow in homage;*
*I dwell at ease within the Purple Palace.*
*Halting my chariot in the void,*
*I rein in dragons and phoenixes.*
*At parting, I leave these plain words,*
*Roughly outlining the wondrous record.*

The second:
*Now I ascend to Heaven,*
*Leaving behind the scholars with reluctance.*
*The Great Dao embodies emptiness and nothingness,*
*Yet within stillness, essence resides.*
*Those who observe call it obscure,*
*But within the profound, clarity shines.*
*Do not say the Dao is empty and false;*
*The fault lies in lack of sincerity.*
*Why not climb the famous mountains*
*And recite the* Cavern Real Scriptures*?*
*With each recitation and chant,*
*The mysterious sound pierces the Great Clarity.*
*The Most High’s golden countenance radiates;*
*The assembled immortals respond in unison.*
*From the ten directions, incense and flowers scatter;*
*Banners of fragrant sandalwood smoke rise.*
*The Royal Consort plays the Nine Shao;*
*Phoenixes and simurghs sing mournfully.*
*Dragon chariots obscure the sky in welcome;*
*Canopies gleam in the distant void.*
*Beyond the desolation of the kalpa’s measure,*
*The Lord of Śakra descends to the courtyard in reverence.*
*The Eight Kings offer the cinnabar elixir;*
*Embracing the current, their bodies become light.*
*Carefree, they wander beyond being and non-being,*
*Illuminating the names and forms of humanity.*
*Divine lads attend on either side;*
*Spontaneously, they pay homage to the myriad spirits.*

The third:
*Soaring in the Eight Radiance Chariot,*
*The flying wheels traverse the Celestial Capital.*
*Wandering leisurely in the Seven Treasures Palace,*
*Together we delight in eternal splendor.*
*Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessings;*
*Former worthies, too, attain rebirth.*
*Kings and lords who are faithful and reverent*
*Shall ultimately become the world’s pillars.*
*If you can uphold sincerity,*
*You too shall ascend to the heavens.*

The Great One embodies the supreme virtue,
All things beneath receive its completion.
Roaming freely through mountains and rivers,
Exhaling and inhaling the numinous essence.
Refining qi in union with the subtle and serene,
Silently chanting the *Dao and Virtue* chapters.
With single-minded grasp of the mysterious void,
Hidden resonance now manifests in full.

Riding a chariot drawn by nine dragons,
Lightly ascending on purple mist.
A brief sojourn at Penglai Palace—
In an instant, already ascended to heaven.
Majestic, the assembly of perfected beings;
Vast and distant, they traverse the empty mystery.
Their bodies endure beyond kalpas,
Golden countenances ever fresh as the sun.

Should one fathom the manifold wonders,
Lightly they rise as divine immortals.

The song concluded, the cloud-borne chariot slowly ascended into heaven and departed.

In the first year of Xianxi of the Chenliu King of Wei, the jiashen year, Lord Lao descended and appeared in Longyou’s Lintao Commandery, Xiangwu County. His body stood thirty feet tall, clad in white robes, with flowing silver hair and a golden crown. He addressed Wang Shi of the county, saying: “The world shall soon attain Great Peace.” When Emperor Wu received the abdication, the realm was indeed unified, and he ordered the construction of the Taiping Abbey at the site of the apparition—formerly the residence of Li Zong.

As recorded in the *Book of Jin*:
Dai Yang of Wuxing was twelve years old when he died and revived after five days. He recounted that in death, a celestial envoy appointed him as wine steward, bestowing upon him a tally and thread, along with attendants and a banner-bearing retinue. He was led to ascend Penglai, Kunlun, Jishi, Taishi, Chang, Lu, Heng, and other sacred mountains, only to be later demoted and sent back. Thereafter, Dai Yang developed a passion for the Daoist arts, mastering divination, astrology, and numerology. At the end of the Wu dynasty, he served as a court scribe but foresaw the dynasty’s fall and feigned illness to avoid office. Once, passing through Lai Xiang, he visited the shrine of Lord Lao. The landscape stirred memories—all was as he had seen in death. He asked the shrine keeper, Ying Feng: “Over twenty years ago, was there a man who rode past the shrine of Lord Lao without dismounting, only to fall from his horse and die before reaching the bridge?” Feng confirmed the event, and all details matched Dai Yang’s account. Thus it became clear that he had been sent back to the mortal realm as a punishment.

The Daoist Liang Chen cultivated the Dao at Louguan, refining his spirit for years. In the second year of Yongxing of Emperor Huai of Jin, the yichou year, on the fifth day of the fifth month, Lord Lao commanded the Perfected One of Grand Harmony, Yin Gui, to descend to his chamber. There, he transmitted the methods of refining qi and concealing one’s form, along with the *Sun and Moon Yellow Splendor Upper Scripture*, *Water and Stone Returned Elixir*, *Six Jia Secret Talismans*, and other scriptures. Liang Chen thereafter gained the ability to fly and transform. Three years later, his elixir perfected, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Later, Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei revered the words of *Laozi*, reciting them tirelessly. He frequently summoned princes and ministers to personally expound its teachings. During the Tianxing era, the Gentleman of Ceremonies, Dong Mi, presented dozens of *Scriptures on Ingesting Immortality Elixirs*, prompting the establishment of the post of Immortal Studies Academician.

In the first year of Tianxing of Emperor An of Jin, the renyin year—the fifth year of Hong Shi of Yao Qin—the immortal Cheng Gongxing traveled through Qin territory and encountered the Daoist Kou Qianzhi. He became Kou’s disciple and retreated to Mount Hua. Suddenly, the mountain spirit appeared, telling Gongxing: “Lord Lao is about to descend and inspect the sacred peaks. You should intensify your purification and devotion.” Gongxing, struck with awe, redoubled his incense offerings and gazed heavenward in anticipation.

On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month, the wuzi night, the Purple Yang and Wen Chang constellations within the Dipper’s bowl blazed open. Lord Lao descended upon a white qilin, his feet treading lotus blossoms. A pair of banners rose thirty feet high, attended by a throng of perfected immortals and jade maidens. As his chariot alighted, Lord Lao turned to Gongxing and said: “You now dwell upon the Central Marchmount; you shall attain immortal deliverance.” Gongxing bowed twice, and when he rose, Lord Lao had vanished.

The following year, the guimao year, in the second month, he relayed the appointed day to his master, Kou Qianzhi. Together, they passed through the pass and settled on the heights of Mount Song’s Shaoshi Peak.

Lord Lao descended again in the Gushui hamlet of Henan, halting his chariot in midair. He addressed Gongxing: “Last year, I appeared on the eastern cliffs of Mount Hua. Now you have come to reside in the Song-Shao region. Since arriving here, what are your thoughts?” Gongxing prostrated himself in reverence. Lord Lao said: “The Song and Shaoshi peaks, the Yellow and Luo rivers—this is the abode of immortals, the abyss of soaring dragons. You must not depart far.” He then commanded a jade maiden to fetch medicine and bestow it upon Gongxing. Gongxing bowed twice, knelt, and consumed it. Lord Lao said: “By ingesting my medicine, your five viscera shall be replenished, your divine mind illuminated, and nothing shall escape your perception. Formerly, I appointed Zhang Daoling as Celestial Master, succeeding Gan Ji. After Zhang Daoling ascended to heaven, demonic forces resurged, and the orthodox lineage of China was severed. Who but your master is fit for this task?”

As recorded in the *Book of Later Wei*:
According to the *Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism* in the *Book of Wei*, during the reign of Emperor Shizu, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi, styled Fuzhen, was the younger brother of Kou Zan, the Governor of Nanyang Commandery, and a thirteenth-generation descendant of Kou Gou. From youth, he harbored a passion for immortality and a heart detached from the mundane. In his early years, he practiced the arts of Zhang Lu, ingesting elixirs and medicinal herbs for years without effect. Yet his hidden sincerity reached the heavens.

There was an immortal named Cheng Gongxing, of unknown origin, who came to work as a hired laborer at the home of Kou Qianzhi’s maternal aunt. When Qianzhi visited his aunt, he saw Gongxing—robust in appearance, tireless in labor—and requested to take him on as a replacement servant. He brought Gongxing home and tasked him with clearing the southern thorn fields. Qianzhi sat beneath a tree, calculating, while Gongxing labored diligently, occasionally glancing at the calculations. Qianzhi said: “Just focus on your work. Why do you keep looking at this?” After two or three days, Gongxing returned to observe again, and this continued repeatedly. Later, Qianzhi encountered difficulties in calculating the seven luminaries and was lost in confusion. Gongxing asked: “Master, why are you troubled?” Qianzhi replied: “I have studied calculation for years, yet recently my *Zhou Bi* calculations fail to align. I am ashamed of this. It is not something you would understand, so why ask?” Gongxing said: “Master, try arranging them as I instruct.” In an instant, the calculations fell into place. Qianzhi marveled, unable to fathom Gongxing’s depth, and begged to become his disciple.

Gongxing firmly declined, insisting only on becoming Qianzhi’s disciple. Before long, he said to him: “Master, if you truly intend to study the Dao, could you follow Gongxing into reclusion?” Qianzhi joyfully agreed. Gongxing then instructed Qianzhi to purify himself through fasting for three days, after which they entered Mount Hua. There, Gongxing had Qianzhi reside in a stone chamber while he went out to gather herbs, returning to give them to Qianzhi. After consuming the herbs, Qianzhi no longer felt hunger. Later, Gongxing took Qianzhi to Mount Song, where three layered stone chambers stood, and had him dwell in the second. After some years, Gongxing said to Qianzhi: “After I depart, someone will bring you medicine—simply consume it without doubt or fear.” Soon after, someone arrived with medicine, but it consisted of venomous insects and foul-smelling things. Terrified, Qianzhi fled. When Gongxing returned and inquired, Qianzhi recounted what had happened. Gongxing sighed in regret: “Master, you are not yet ready for immortality—you may only become a teacher to emperors.” Gongxing served Qianzhi for seven years before suddenly declaring: “I cannot stay much longer. Tomorrow at noon, I shall depart.” After Gongxing’s passing, he instructed Qianzhi to bathe himself, saying that someone would come to receive him. Gongxing then entered the third stone chamber and died. Qianzhi personally performed the ablutions. The next day at noon, someone knocked at the stone chamber. When Qianzhi emerged, he saw two youths—one holding ritual robes, the other a bowl and staff. He led them to Gongxing’s body, whereupon Gongxing rose upright, donned the robes, took the bowl and staff, and departed.

Earlier, a man from Baocheng in Jingzhao named Wang Hu’er had lost his uncle, who possessed extraordinary spiritual powers. The uncle once took Hu’er to a separate ridge of Mount Song, where they gazed upon a vision of golden halls and jade chambers. Among them stood a particularly resplendent pavilion, empty and unoccupied, inscribed with the words: *Hall of Cheng Gongxing*. Perplexed, Hu’er asked about it, and his uncle replied: “This is the hall of the immortal Cheng Gongxing. Once, he lost seven rooms in a fire and was demoted to serve as Kou Qianzhi’s disciple for seven years.” Only then did they realize that Qianzhi’s sincerity had reached far, and that Gongxing was indeed an immortal who, having completed his sentence, had departed.

Gongxing served Qianzhi for seven years before ascending as an immortal, while Qianzhi remained on Mount Song, steadfast and unwavering in his devotion. In the tenth month of the second year of the *Shenrui* era of Emperor Mingyuan of the Northern Wei, on the day *yimao*, two divine beings suddenly appeared before Qianzhi. Clad in kingfisher-feathered robes and crowned with purple-gold diadems, they rode dragons and bore tablets, announcing: “The Most High Lord Lao has arrived.” Soon after, the sound of celestial music drew near. Looking up, Qianzhi saw a jade-hubbed chariot, its wheels forged of *vajra*, drawn by nine dragons, its majesty resplendent. Divine attendants filled the void, and the procession alighted upon the mountain’s peak. Five immortal officials stood in attendance before him. Qianzhi witnessed the sudden opening of five celestial gates, celestial music resounding as the Most High Lord Lao sat upon a silver-flowered throne. He commanded the immortal minister Wang Fangping to bring Qianzhi forward and stand before him, saying: “In the year *xinhai*, I received a memorial from Zhao Hongzheng, the *Zhenling* Governor of the Immortal Assembly of Mount Song’s Sacred Peak, stating: ‘Since the passing of Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, those on earth who cultivate goodness have lacked a teacher. As you embody upright principle and conduct in harmony with nature, your talents suit you to serve as a model. You are thus fit to assume the role of teacher.’ I have come to observe you and now appoint you to the office of Celestial Master, bestowing upon you the *Yunzhong Yinsong Xinke Zhi Jie* (New Precepts of the Cloud-Chanting Rites). I possess scriptures and precepts, hidden since the dawn of time, which now, by the turning of fate, must be revealed. You shall proclaim my new precepts, rectify my teachings, assist the state and sustain the mandate, transforming the multitudes. Abolish the corruptions of the Three Zhangs—the levies of grain and coin, and the arts of yin-yang union.”

The Most High Lord Lao lingered in the clouds for three days, bestowing upon Qianzhi nine scrolls of scriptures and precepts, with ritual propriety as their foundation, supplemented by the practices of *qi*-absorption and inner refinement. He also dispatched twelve jade maidens, including Changrong, to teach him the secrets of *qi*-absorption and guiding-and-pulling. Thereafter, Qianzhi’s *qi* flourished, his body grew light, and his complexion became radiant.

On the fifteenth day of the first month of the second year of the *Taichang* era, the year *dingsi*, the Most High Lord Lao descended again, bestowing seventy scrolls of new precepts and talismans, collectively titled *Bingjin* (Simultaneous Advancement). In the eighth year of the *Guihai* era, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he further dispatched his great-great-grandson, the Perfected Master of the Pastoral Palace, Li Puwen, to descend upon Mount Song and summon Qianzhi into the immortal palace. There, he conferred upon Qianzhi the four registers of *Tian’gong Taizhen Taibao Jiuzhou Zhenshi* (Celestial Palace’s Supreme Perfected and Treasured Master of the Nine Provinces), *Zhigui Shi* (Master of Governing Spirits), *Huamin Shi* (Master of Transforming the People), and *Jitian Shi* (Successor to the Celestial Master), along with immortal crowns, celestial robes, talismans, charts, and altar rituals. He also bestowed the *Taiping Sujing* (Fundamental Scripture of Great Peace) in one hundred scrolls, all inscribed in authentic celestial script with large characters, personally transcribed by the Perfected Master. He commanded Qianzhi to present the scriptures to the state and propagate their teachings in the year *jiazi*. Additionally, he granted six celestial fruits, the consumption of which allowed Qianzhi to abstain from cooked food.

As recorded in the *Wei Shu: Shilao Zhi* (History of the Wei: Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism), Li Puwen was a great-great-grandson of the Most High Lord Lao. Formerly residing in Sanggan of Daijun, he attained the Dao during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han and became the Master of the Pastoral Palace, governing the administration of thirty-six earthly spirits and humans, with a domain spanning over 180,000 *li*—a number extending through one cycle of the *He* (River Chart). Within this domain, there were 360 regions, each spanning ten thousand *li*. Mount Song’s jurisdiction encompassed the vast and level lands of Guanghan, which were entrusted to Qianzhi. He issued a proclamation: “I reside in the Celestial Palace, expounding the true Dharma. You, at the age of twenty-two, have spent ten years in youthful ignorance, leaving twelve years for teaching and transformation. Though your merits are not yet great, you have labored in instruction. Now, I promote you to the inner office of *Taizhen Taibao Jiuzhou Zhenshi* (Supreme Perfected and Treasured Master of the Nine Provinces), *Zhigui Shi* (Master of Governing Spirits), *Huamin Shi* (Master of Transforming the People), and *Jitian Shi* (Successor to the Celestial Master). Persevere without slackening, and in accordance with your efforts, I shall further promote you, bestowing the *Tianzhong Erzhen Taiwen Lu* (Register of the Supreme Script of the Two Perfected Ones of the Celestial Center), enabling you to summon and command the hundred spirits and transmit them to your disciples.”

The *Lu* (Registers) comprise five ranks: first, the *Yinyang Taiguan* (Grand Offices of Yin and Yang); second, the *Zhengfu Zhenguan* (Perfected Offices of the Rightful Courts); third, the *Zhengfang Zhenguan* (Perfected Offices of the Rightful Chambers); fourth, the *Suguan Sanguan* (Officials of the Lodged and Dispersed); and fifth, the *Bingjin Lusheng* (Concurrent Disciples of the Registers). The altar positions, rites of obeisance, vestments, and ceremonial forms each follow graded distinctions, totaling over sixty scrolls, collectively titled the *Lutu Zhenjing* (True Scripture of Registers and Charts). These I entrust to you for reverent observance, that you may assist the *Taiping Zhenjun* (Supreme Perfected Lord of Great Peace) of the Northern Realm.

The method of the *Tian’guan Jinglun* (Tranquil Wheel of the Celestial Offices) enables one to undertake and complete constructions, thereby transcending to the rank of True Immortal. Yet the people of the world now face the descent of the kalpa’s decline, making the propagation of the teachings exceedingly difficult. Simply instruct men and women to establish altars and perform morning and evening rites of obeisance. If a household has a stern patriarch, his merit extends to former generations; among them, those who cultivate the body, refine the elixir, and study the arts of longevity become the *Zhongmin* (Seed People) of the True Lords.

The methods for preparing medicines—including the formulas for refining the Golden Elixir and the Eighty-Three Nectars of *Yunying* (Cloud Radiance)—each possess essential secrets. Several chapters were inscribed by the hand of the Supreme Master Li Jun, while the remainder were written by the Perfected Scribe Zhao Daofu of the Rightful True Bureau. The ancient script is inscribed along the margins, interspersed with seal and clerical scripts, its phrases concise yet discerning, graceful and well-wrought. Its overarching principles align with the rites of the world, prioritizing those of virtue and trustworthiness, with the diligent following thereafter.

It further states that between the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) lie the Thirty-Six Heavens, each governed by one of the Thirty-Six Offices. The highest of these is the *Wuji Zhizun* (Ultimate Venerable One), followed by the *Zhida Zhenzun* (Supreme Perfected Venerable One), then the *Tianfu Dizai Yinyang Zhenzun* (Perfected Venerable One of Heaven’s Cover and Earth’s Support, of Yin and Yang), and next the *Hongzheng Zhenzun* (Venerable One of Vast Rectitude), whose surname is Zhao and given name Daoyin. He attained the Dao during the Yin dynasty and is the Master of *Musu* (Pastoral Earth). Since the advent of *Musu*, the company of immortals—including *Chisong* (Red Pine), *Wang Qiao*, *Han Zhong*, *Zhang Anshi*, *Liu Gen*, and *Zhang Ling*—along with more recent transcendents, have all served as his attendants.

*Musu* commanded Qian to become his disciple, binding him in fraternal fellowship with the host of divine immortals. Matters of the netherworld, which the world does not comprehend, Qian explained to them one by one. In the first year of the *Shiguang* reign (jiazi year) of Emperor Taiwu, the Master, obeying the edict, presented these writings to the court. The four directions responded with unanimous reverence, though the imperial court had not yet fully embraced them. The Minister of Education, Cui Hao—a scholar of vast learning—marveled at the teachings and accordingly became the Master’s disciple. He then memorialized the throne, stating:

*“I have heard that when a sage receives the Mandate of Heaven, auspicious omens respond. Yet the* He Tu *and* Luo Shu *conveyed their messages through the patterns of beasts and insects—nothing compares to the present encounter between divine and mortal, where the Master’s hand has inscribed resplendent words of profound and wondrous import, unparalleled since antiquity. Though Emperor Gaozu of Han was a paragon of sagacity, the Four Hoary Ones still refused to bend their principles. Now, a transcendent of pure virtue has arrived unbidden—this is truly the celestial sign that Your Majesty walks in the footsteps of the Yellow Emperor and Fuxi, answering Heaven’s decree. How can such a divine mandate be dismissed as mere worldly discourse?”*

The Emperor joyfully approved and accepted the memorial, promptly ordering officials to journey to the mountain, present offerings, and welcome the remaining disciples dwelling there.

The Emperor, seeing that the Master partook of no earthly sustenance, accorded him even greater reverence and respect. Upon beholding the talismans and registers, his heart swelled with devotion and faith. Thereupon, he established the Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, erected the Palace of Serene Wheels in Heaven, and convened a grand assembly in accordance with ritual. The Master and his disciples all donned immortal robes and celestial crowns, their luminous presence resplendent. The Emperor wished to bestow upon the Master and his disciples high ranks and titles, but they firmly declined, accepting only the rites due to those beyond the mundane realm. By imperial decree, the Master and his disciples were ranked above princes and dukes, yet they refused, insisting on the proper forms of address. Thus, the new teachings were proclaimed and disseminated throughout the realm, greatly propagating the transformation of purity, stillness, and non-action.

Separately, one hundred and twenty disciples of virtuous conduct were selected from noble families to become Daoists. In the seventeenth year, the gengchen year, the Master established a terrace upon the lofty peaks to perform the Daoist rites and pray for blessings upon the Emperor. The Lord Lao commanded that the Emperor be granted the title "True Lord of Grand Peace," bestowing upon him a crown, robes, talismans, and registers. The Master returned and presented this in full report, whereupon the reign title was changed to "True Lord of Grand Peace," and a general amnesty was declared throughout the empire.

In the third year, the renwu year, Qianzhi memorialized: “Now that Your Majesty governs the age as the True Lord, having established the rites of the Palace of Serene Wheels in Heaven—an achievement unparalleled since antiquity—it is fitting that you ascend to receive the talismanic writ, thereby manifesting your sagely virtue.” The Emperor assented and personally approached the ritual terrace to receive the talismanic threads. His ceremonial procession was fully arrayed, with banners and standards all turned toward the color of blue-green, in accordance with Daoist tradition. Thereafter, each succeeding emperor, upon ascending the throne, received the registers in like manner.

Volume Eight of *The Sacred Records of the Primordial Origin*
Compiled by Xie Shoubin, Grand Master of Observing the Return of the Song Dynasty

In the third year of the Jiande reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, on the bingzi day of the fifth month, the Buddhist teachings were abolished, and all scriptures and images were destroyed.

The Emperor further deliberated on abolishing the Daoist teachings and summoned the Daoist priest Yan Da to inquire: “Which is superior, Dao or Buddhism?”
Da replied: “The host is superior, the guest inferior.”
The Emperor asked: “How does one distinguish host from guest?”
Da said: “Buddhism originated in the Western Regions—is it not the guest? Dao resides in the Central Lands—is it not the host?”
The Emperor said: “If the guest returns west, does the host not see them off?”
Da replied: “If the guest returns, it benefits the lands of the Hu; if the host remains, it does no harm to the Middle Kingdom. Those who depart are not pursued, and those who stay preserve themselves—is this not acceptable?”
The Emperor praised his response, yet having already initiated the deliberation, he proceeded to abolish both, leaving only the temples of the Five Sacred Mountains.

On the bingwu day of the sixth month, as the Emperor was about to hold court, he suddenly saw a yellow-robed messenger descending from the sky, holding a jade tablet inscribed in cinnabar, who proclaimed: “A decree from the Most High.”
Startled, the Emperor unconsciously bowed.
The messenger presented the decree, saying: “To Yuwen Yong: The teachings of the Great Dao and its scriptures have endured since antiquity, preserving and regulating Heaven and Earth, delivering and saving living beings. What concern is it of yours that you rashly abolish them? As a ruler of the age, you have scorned the Mandate of Heaven and cut yourself off from it. It is not that Heaven has abandoned you—why do you persist in evil, hastening your own punishment?”
The Emperor read it again and again. The messenger said: “The Mandate of Heaven is not constant; delay is not permitted.” He then retrieved the decree and soared into the sky.
The Emperor remained shaken for days before restoring the Tongdao Abbey in the capital, appointing Yan Da to oversee it. He also summoned masters of the Way from the mountains to lecture on the *Daodejing*.

On the wuwu day, he issued an edict: “The Great Dao is vast and profound, formless yet boundless, embracing both emptiness and existence, its principles reaching into the deepest mysteries. Yet as paths diverge, their sources grow distant; purity and simplicity scatter, and forms and instruments fall into discord. Thus, the Three Mohists and Eight Confucians, the reds and purples, vie in competition; the Nine Schools and Seven Summaries propagate conflicting doctrines. The Way, concealed in minor achievements, has long been thus. Without a unifying return, disputes will never cease.
Now, let a Tongdao Abbey be established in the capital. The subtle words of sages, the canonical teachings of former worthies, the golden precepts and jade inscriptions, the secret traces and mysterious texts—all that can nourish the common people and uphold the teachings—should be broadly expounded and unified as one. Thus, those who grasp at clods of earth may recognize the towering majesty of Mount Song, and those who cling to gravel may awaken to the vast clarity of the Bohai Sea—is this not fitting?”
He then ordered the compilation of texts from the Nine Schools, selecting those aligned with the Dao, and incorporated them into the *Daoist Canon*.

In the seventh year of the Daye reign of the Sui, the xinwei year, Emperor Yang personally led an expedition against Liaodong. Qi Hui, a Daoist of the Louguan Abbey, said to his disciples: “The Way of Heaven is about to change; I shall yet witness it, though it will be within a few years.”
Someone asked: “What will the future hold?”
He replied: “A descendant of the Old Lord shall rule the world. Thereafter, our teachings will flourish greatly, though I fear this frail body may not endure long.”
Several years later, the Sui Dynasty indeed fell into chaos.

In the thirteenth year of the Daye reign, the dingchou year, the Old Lord descended upon Mount Zhongnan and spoke to the mountain dweller Li Chunfeng: “The Duke of Tang shall receive the Mandate of Heaven.”
Thereafter, Chunfeng pledged allegiance to the Tang. *From* The Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl.

When Emperor Gaozu of Tang first raised righteous troops in Jinyang, his daughter, Princess Pingyang—the wife of Chai Shao—also raised troops to respond, stationing them at the Yishou Palace. Hui, foreseeing the advent of the true lord, contributed all the abbey’s resources and provisions to her army.
When the Emperor reached the Putong Pass, Hui rejoiced, saying: “This is the true lord! He shall surely pacify the Four Quarters.” He then changed his name to Pingding in response and dispatched over eighty Daoists to the pass to welcome him.
The Emperor praised him and issued a decree: “Now that the righteous banner is raised in the east and the headquarters opened in the west, the establishment of offices and division of duties depend upon loyalty. The Daoist Qi Pingding, who has renounced the world to seek the truth, forsaken fame and departed from the俗, embracing tranquility and rejecting glory, untroubled by seclusion, has yet devoted his robes and resources to supply military attire, and apportioned his grain to sustain the army. His loyalty and integrity are commendable; he deserves recognition. Pingding shall be appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Gold, and those below him shall be granted ranks accordingly as Grand Masters for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Blue, in reward for his righteousness.”
Pingding firmly declined, saying: “This humble servant, in welcoming the sagely lord, reveres the root of the Dao. The yellow cap does not value gold and purple; the Mysterious Teachings esteem silver and blue. Though I receive this singular favor, I fear it is not fitting.”
The Emperor said: “Master, accept for now. Once we take the capital, further arrangements shall be made.”

At that time, the Sui general Song Laosheng was stationed at Huoyi to resist the righteous troops. As continuous rain had fallen for ten days, supplies could not be transported, and Emperor Gaozu ordered a retreat. The Prince of Qin vehemently remonstrated, and the retreat was halted.
An old man in white approached the military gate and said: “I am the spirit of Mount Huo. The Most High Old Lord has sent me to inform the Duke of Tang: The rain shall cease in the eighth month. Take the road southeast of Huoyi, and I shall aid your army.”
Emperor Gaozu said: “This spirit does not deceive. How could Zhao Yuanxu fail me?”
On the xinsi day of the eighth month, Emperor Gaozu led his troops to Huoyi, beheaded Laosheng, and pacified the region.

On the eighth day of the eleventh month, envoys were dispatched to the Louguan Abbey to perform a jiao ritual and pray for blessings.

That evening, white clouds like a canopy shaded the altar grounds, intertwining with the rising incense. A pair of white deer also approached the palace gates, let out several long calls, and then departed. The event was swiftly reported by courier. The next day, the capital was indeed captured, and the era name was changed to Yining.

In the first month of the first year of Wude in the Tang Dynasty, Liu Wu Zhou dispatched Song Jingang with an army of one hundred thousand to invade Jin and Jiang. Prince of Qin, Li Shimin, was stationed in Jiangzhou. A local of Jiangzhou, Ji Shanxing, a man of simple and upright character, had taken refuge in Datong Fort in Linfen County of Jin. The villagers sent Shanxing to Yangjiao Mountain to scout for bandits. As he reached the ridge to the northwest, between two persimmon trees, he saw a man riding a white horse approaching from the slope. Shanxing found this strange and turned to run back to the sweet pear tree below, but the man had already arrived. From behind, he called out to Shanxing: "Stop, do not be afraid." Turning his head, Shanxing saw an old man with white hair and beard, dressed in plain robes and a black cap, holding a red whisk, riding a white horse whose tail and hooves were all crimson. Two young attendants in green, their heads wrapped in red cloth, stood by his sides. The old man said to Shanxing: "Tell the Tang Emperor Li: Now that sagely governance is achieved, the state and altars shall endure. He should establish the Anhua Palace in the east of Chang’an and install Daoist images there, and the realm will know great peace." With these words, he soared into the sky and vanished.

On the night of the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month, Shanxing was at home when it seemed someone summoned him. The next morning, he found himself unknowingly back at the place where he had stood before. Again, he saw the old man, wearing a golden crown, dressed and mounted as before. The old man asked Shanxing: "Do you remember what I told you earlier?" Shanxing replied: "I remember it all." The old man said: "Go at once and report to the Emperor what I have said." Shanxing said: "I am poor and have no provisions for the journey, nor any official document. How can I reach him?" The old man said: "The way ahead will be provided; you need not worry." Shanxing said: "To see the Emperor is no small matter. How can I prove my words when I arrive in the capital?" The old man said: "When you reach the capital, there will be someone presenting a stone turtle. You may use that as proof." With these words, he disappeared.

Shanxing went to see He Ruo Xiaoyi, the Chief Administrator of the Jinzhou General’s Office, and told him what had occurred. It was the third day of the fifth month. Xiaoyi detained Shanxing, and on the eleventh day, he brought him before the Prince of Qin, who listened to the full account of the old man’s appearance and words. On the thirteenth day, the Prince of Qin dispatched Du Ang, Commander of the Left Imperial Guards, to accompany Shanxing to the site of the vision to perform a sacrifice. As they bowed and were about to rise, suddenly the old man appeared as before, amidst purple clouds. He raised his whip and pointed at Ang, asking: "Who are you?" Ang replied: "I am Du Ang, envoy of the Prince of Qin, come to offer sacrifices with respect." The old man said: "I neither drink nor eat; what need have I of sacrifices?" Then, pointing at Shanxing, he said: "All that was entrusted, this man knows." Ang returned and reported the divine man’s reappearance. He was then ordered to draft a memorial and escort Shanxing by courier to the capital.

On the nineteenth day of the fifth month, as they arrived at the gate of the imperial court, there was indeed Zhang Da, Attendant Gentleman of Zouzhou, presenting a stone resembling a turtle, inscribed with the words: "The realm is at peace, descendants flourish, for ten thousand years." Together, they entered to make their report. Emperor Gaozu was greatly pleased. On the sixth day of the seventh month, an edict was issued appointing Shanxing Gentleman for Court Audiences. The Court Attendant Liu Xian was ordered to establish a temple on Yangjiao Mountain. On the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, Shanxing arrived at the temple site and again saw the old man between the two trees. A great canopy was spread, and he sat beneath a forest of ivory tusks, leaning on a jade table. A net of pearl flowers draped over him, and two young attendants in green came to serve. Behind him stood a yellow-robed warrior holding a horse. The old man asked: "Is the Emperor pleased?" Shanxing replied: "He is greatly pleased, but he wonders who the sagely one is." The old man said: "I am the Most High Divine Immortal, surnamed Li, named Boyang, known as the Old Lord. I am the imperial ancestor. In Guyang County of Bozhou, a withered juniper has revived—this may serve as verification. After the bandits are pacified this year, the realm will know great peace, and the dynasty shall endure." With these words, he suddenly vanished.

Shanxing again reported this to He Ruo Xiaoyi. Xiaoyi dispatched Xi Tong, the Registrar of Xiangyang County, to ride posthaste with Shanxing to present the memorial. The High Ancestor bestowed upon Shanxing an imperial robe and a bundle of silk. In the second year, in the fifth month, he ordered the Prefect of Louguan to renovate and rebuild the Hall of the Old Lord, the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, and the Temple of Perfected Master Yin, ensuring all structures within the abbey were spacious and grand, befitting their revered stature. He also granted ten *qing* of land and the land of the Xianyou Supervisory Office to serve as the abbey’s estate. Furthermore, he established a supervisory office beside the abbey, appointing officials to oversee its construction, and designated the Prefect of Qiping as the abbey’s administrator.

In the spring of the third year, the Emperor personally visited the Old Lord at his shrine. Pingding led the Daoist assembly to welcome the imperial carriage and presented a feast for a thousand people. The Emperor summoned Pingding, the Dharma Master Lü Daoji, and the Fast Supervisor Zhao Daolong, granting them seats. He then ordered all officials to be seated and partake in the meal, saying: “Our distant ancestor has personally descended here. As the sovereign of the realm, how can We not undertake grand constructions?” Thereupon, he issued an edict renaming Louguan as Zongsheng Abbey and bestowed two hundred *shi* of white rice and one thousand bolts of silk for the abbey’s repairs.

Zongsheng Abbey was the former residence of Perfected Master Yin. According to the *Xuan Shi Zhi*: When Perfected Master Yin was about to ascend, he entrusted a stone casket to his disciples, instructing them: “This casket contains talismans and registers. Do not open it rashly.” During the *Dali* era, a man from Qinghe named Cui Jun served as the Prefect of Jianwei. Upon arriving at his post, he heard of Perfected Master Yin’s casket and laughed, saying to his officials: “The deception of Xin Yuanping is evident here.” He immediately went to the abbey and ordered the lock broken. The Daoist Yan Shenbai said: “The Perfected Master left instructions: ‘Whoever opens my casket will bring great misfortune upon themselves.’ I implore Your Lordship not to violate the Perfected Master’s covenant.” Cui Jun grew angry and said: “Perfected Master Yin has been dead for a thousand years—how could this stone casket alone remain?” He ordered the lock broken, but it would not budge. Cui then had leather straps tied to the casket’s handles and used several oxen to drag it, whipping them until the lock gave way and the casket opened. Inside were dozens of scrolls of talismans and registers, inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, radiant as if newly written. After examining them, Cui Jun said: “I initially thought the casket contained rare treasures, which is why I opened it. Now I see it holds only talismans and registers.” He then resealed and locked it before departing.

That very night, he died suddenly but revived after three days. His officials all came to pay their respects and inquire about his condition. Cui Jun said: “I was always clever and had never heard of divine immortals. After opening Perfected Master Yin’s stone casket, I was indeed seized by officials of the netherworld. At first, a purple-robed scribe told me: ‘I am a scribe of the netherworld, acting on orders to summon you. You cannot refuse—resistance will only bring greater misfortune. You must come quickly.’ Though I was alarmed and wished to decline, I found myself already departing with the messenger. After leaving the prefectural city and traveling fifty *li*, we arrived at the netherworld. The official there was the former Chancellor Lü, who said to me: ‘Why did you open Perfected Master Yin’s stone casket? Now, by the command of the Supreme Emperor, your official rank and lifespan are to be revoked. What say you to this?’ He then summoned the Record Keeper, who examined my register of rank and lifespan and reported: ‘He has held five offices and has seventeen years of life remaining.’ Now, by the Supreme Emperor’s decree, all five offices are revoked, and fifteen years of life are erased. Only two years remain.’ Thus, I was permitted to return. Two years later, I indeed died.”

In the third month of the fifth year, Ji Shanxing arrived at the temple before Yangjiao Mountain and saw the Old Lord seated in the hall, leaning on a jade table, with immortals arrayed in attendance, divine soldiers standing guard, and a procession of dragon and tiger riders, banners, and standards filling the sky. A herald summoned Shanxing forward and said: “The withered juniper at the temple in Bozhou has revived. Our grandson shall reign as king. I have already dispatched the Duke of Zhou, Dan, with divine troops to assist the state in suppressing Hei Kan. The victory is assured by the fourth month.” Xiaoyi dispatched Ma Jingqing, the Military Staff Officer, to ride posthaste and present the memorial. He then ordered Shanxing to travel by relay carriage to the army at Luozhou to deliver the proclamation. At the appointed time, Hei He was indeed pacified. (From the *Old唐书*.)

In the tenth month of the seventh year, the *jiashen* year, the Emperor visited Louguan to sacrifice to the Old Lord. Earlier, the High Ancestor had decreed that Wang Yuanzhi, a Daoist of Yuqing Abbey, be appointed Gentleman for Court Discussion and bestowed upon him a gold-threaded crown and a purple silk cloud-patterned robe, for Yuanzhi had once received the Old Lord’s decree foretelling the receipt of the Mandate. Yuanzhi was a disciple of Tao Hongjing.

When Emperor Yang of Sui was the Prince of Jin and governed Yangzhou, he established the Yuqing Xuantan to house Yuanzhi. Messengers arrived in succession, and Yuanzhi came to pay his respects. In an instant, his hair and beard turned white, frightening the prince, who sent him away. Soon after, his appearance returned to normal. When Emperor Taizong of Tang campaigned against Wang Shichong, he and Fang Xuanling visited Yuanzhi in disguise. Though they were unrecognized, Yuanzhi immediately greeted them, saying: “You shall become a sovereign of great peace. Take care of yourself.” After Taizong ascended the throne, he personally received Yuanzhi’s registers and methods, appointing him Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan Ribbon.

In the ninth year of *Zhenguan*, Yuanzhi firmly requested to return to the mountains. An edict was issued to establish Taiping Abbey on Maoshan and ordain twenty-seven Daoists. A jade-sealed decree was bestowed, saying: “When We were still a prince, We early gained the opportunity to seek the Dao from you. Your virtuous demeanor remains ever in Our thoughts, waking and dreaming. Recently, upon reading your memorial requesting to return to your old mountain, We have issued a separate edict to honor your lofty aspirations. The abbey We have ordered established shall serve as a testament to Our enduring devotion.”

After the Master returned to the mountains, he said to his disciple Pan Shizheng: “Recently, I saw the celestial register, which revealed that in a past life I had inadvertently harmed a young boy’s lips, preventing my ascent to heaven. Now, I have been summoned to serve as the Immortal Lord of Shaoshi. My departure is imminent.” The following day, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, burned incense, and passed away at the age of one hundred and twenty-six. An imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title of Grand Master for Proper Consultation with Gold and Purple Ribbon, and he was honored as Master Yisheng of Ascended Perfection.

In the first year of *Zhenguan*, on the *bingwu* day of the seventh month, Emperor Taizong ordered the restoration of the Supreme Lord Lao’s Temple in Bozhou and the Temple of Master Yan in {Duizhou}, each granted two thousand households for sacrificial offerings. In the ninth year, on the *dingmao* day of the second month, the King of Khotan sent his son to pay tribute. When asked about his kingdom’s lands, the prince mentioned that to the west stood the Vimalakīrti Monastery, said to be where Laozi transformed the Hu barbarians. The Hu customs were thus softened, and Laozi ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The people, longing for him, built the monastery in his memory.

On the twenty-fifth day of the first month in the eleventh year, an edict was issued: “The Exemplar Lord bequeathed a model of purity and emptiness, while Śākyamuni left a principle of cause and effect. Though their teachings differ in approach, both guide seekers toward the same ultimate truth. Their doctrines, though distinct in method, converge in their profound benefit. The Great Dao’s practice originated in remote antiquity, arising from the nameless beginning, transcending form, governing the two modes of yin and yang, and nurturing the myriad things. Thus, it governs states and restores order, returning all to simplicity and sincerity. The rise of Buddhism, rooted in the Western Regions, spread to the Central Plains during the Eastern Han. Its principles of divine transformation are manifold, and its retributions varied. In recent times, devotion to it has deepened. People seek present blessings, while households fear future calamities. Thus, the vulgar mock the profound Dao, while those drawn to the strange vie to follow the true essence. What began as a ripple among the common folk has swelled into a tide sweeping the court. As a result, the teachings of foreign lands now overshadow the myriad wonders of our own, while the doctrines of the Central Plains lag behind the single vehicle. This drift has persisted for years, and We cannot but reflect deeply.

We, in reverent awe, have long pondered the Supreme Dao, seeking to rectify past errors and restore proper order. Moreover, Our imperial lineage descends from the Keeper of the Archives. The flourishing of Our dynasty relies on the power of supreme virtue, and the pacification of the realm depends on the virtue of non-action. It is fitting to make adjustments and propagate this profound transformation. Henceforth, in all matters of fasting, offerings, processions, and recitations, Daoist priests and nuns shall precede Buddhist monks and nuns. May the customs of our ancestral roots flourish throughout the nine provinces, and the reverence for Our origins endure for ten thousand generations.” The decree was proclaimed throughout the empire, and the responsible officials were ordered to implement it.

In the twenty-first year, an edict commanded the translation of Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue* into Sanskrit, to be bestowed upon the kingdoms of India. Earlier, when the Tang was destined to receive the Mandate, the Lord Lao had dispatched the immortal official Ma Zhou from the White Spirit Palace on Mount Hua to assist the Sacred Scion in founding the dynasty. Yet Zhou indulged in wine, drowning in worldly dust for twenty years, reduced to poverty and hardship. Hearing of Yuan Tiangang’s skill in physiognomy, he sought him out to divine his fortune. Tiangang gazed at him for a long while and said: “Your five spirits have fled, and your body lingers like a corpse. What fate could you possibly have?” Zhou was startled and asked for a method to avert disaster. Tiangang replied: “Go eastward at once. You will encounter an old man riding an ox. Do not approach or speak to him; simply follow him, and this calamity may be averted.”

Zhou followed his instructions. Before leaving the capital’s gates, he indeed saw an old man riding an ox exit the city. Zhou silently trailed behind, winding through village paths until they ascended a great mountain. At the summit, the old man turned, dismounted, and sat beneath a tree. He said: “The Supreme Lord commanded you to assist the Sacred Scion in founding the dynasty and saving the world. Why have you drowned in wine, bringing yourself to ruin and starvation? Your five spirits have scattered, and your vital qi has dissipated. You are on the verge of death—why have you not reflected and reformed?” Zhou, bewildered, did not understand. The old man said: “You were once an immortal official of the White Spirit Palace. Now, the Immortal King of Mount Hua has sent for you.” They entered the palace, arriving before a grand hall where the attendants stood in solemn array, as if before an emperor’s court. Approaching the curtain, a voice reprimanded him for his disrespect in failing his mission, casting aside his duties. He was ordered to return to his former post to reflect on his errors and submit a confession.

The old man and several officials escorted him to a separate courtyard in the eastern quarters. Upon seeing the gate, he found his name still inscribed there. Unlocking it, he entered to find the furnace, tripod, bed, and mat exactly as he had left them. After pondering for a long while, five figures in five-colored robes suddenly appeared before him, saying: “We are the spirits of your five viscera. You have wallowed in drunkenness, defiling your body. We have long since departed.” They instructed him to close his eyes, promising to return him to the divine chamber. Zhou complied, and in an instant, his mind cleared, and he recalled his past life—over twenty years had passed like a few days.

Returning to his former residence, he emerged into the Immortal King’s court and prostrated himself in apology. He received his mission anew and was sent to Chang’an. The next day, he visited Tiangang again. Tiangang exclaimed in surprise: “What encounter have you had? You are already transformed!” He added: “In sixty days, you will rise nine ranks; in a hundred days, you will attain the position of Chancellor. Take care of yourself.” During the *Zhenguan* era, military officials each submitted strategies for governing the state. Zhou, acting on behalf of the general Chang He, presented a memorial. Taizong was greatly pleased and appointed him *Shiyi* and *Jiancha Yushi* on the same day. Thereafter, he steadily rose to high office, serving as *Zhongshu Ling* for several years.

One day, a group of immortals descended into his chamber and said: “Your service to the state is complete. You may retire. The Supreme Unity has summoned you—do not linger.” The following day, he passed away without illness.

*(From the* Tang History.*)*

*The Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* contains an identical account.

In the second year of *Longshuo* during the reign of Emperor Gaozong (662 CE), the emperor visited the Luoyang Palace. Moved by sudden inspiration, he ordered an inquiry into any ancient sacred sites or numinous traces nearby. The elders reported: “North of the imperial city lies a mountain with an old shrine to Laozi. Whenever prayers are offered there, blessings manifest without delay.” The emperor immediately dispatched Xu Lishi, the prefectural governor of Luozhou, to rebuild the shrine as a pure temple. During excavation, a stone altar and an ancient stele were unearthed. The stele bore the inscription: *Stele of the Perfected One, Lord Bai*. It had been erected by the immortal Bai Zhongli, and was the site where the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling established the Northern Yu治.

The stone altar measured four *chi* in length, two *chi* in width, two *cun* in thickness, and eight *cun* in height. It had two legs at each end, and the surface was engraved with the characters *Tai Shang Lao Jun*. After the hall was completed, a grand Daoist ritual was held to celebrate and invoke blessings. Upon the conclusion of the *jiao* ceremony, a sudden white radiance enveloped the hall, illuminating the steps and altar. Laozi appeared within the light, flanked by two Perfected Ones, and lingered for a long while before vanishing. Thirteen witnesses—including Quan Dali, the Supervisor of the Palace Chambers, and Yang Hu, the Recorder of Luozhou—jointly submitted a memorial detailing what they had seen. An imperial edict ordered the event to be depicted as an auspicious portrait of Laozi. Officials presented congratulatory memorials, one of which read:

*“The numinous presence beneath the pillar scatters its light across the altar and hall; the immortal attendants at the rafters pour forth wondrous splendor upon the steps and courtyard. Truly, this response to utmost sincerity befits the sagely virtue of the emperor—how could it be compared to the glory of Yu’s reign, the auspicious airs of Han, the descent of sacred birds at sacrifices, or the flourishing of mulberry and catalpa in the royal domain?”*

Later, during the reign of Emperor Minghuang, Wu Daozi was commissioned to paint the portraits of successive sagely emperors within the hall and to adorn the walls of the corridor with murals. Du Fu’s poem *Visiting the Temple of the Mysterious Origin Emperor North of Luoyang* reads:

*“Mountains and rivers uphold the embroidered doors,
Sun and moon draw near the carved beams.
The immortal plum’s roots run deep,
The catalpa and orchid’s leaves gleam with luster.
The ancestral house preserves old histories,
The Dao and its virtue are entrusted to the present king.
The painter’s hand studies the masters of old—
Wu’s artistry stands unrivaled.
The forest of spirits shifts the earth’s axis,
Its sublime wonder stirs the palace walls.
Five sages arrayed in dragon robes,
A thousand officials in ranks of mounted riders.
Their crowns and tassels all flourish,
Their pendants and ornaments all soar.
Though he withdrew in humility beneath the Zhou,
His classics and teachings embraced the Han emperors.
If the Valley Spirit does not die,
Where else could one nurture simplicity?”*

This refers to the same temple.

Ouyang Xiu’s *Collected Antiquities* includes a postscript to *Visiting the Temple of the Mysterious Origin Emperor*, which states: “Emperor Xuanzong of Tang composed the stele inscription and wrote it himself. I have seen his calligraphy for *The Magpie and the Swan’s Neck* in the world, and the script is identical to this. The stele stands on a mountain north of Deng in Luoyang—locals call it the Temple of Laozi.” The postscript notes that Emperor Minghuang must have composed an imperial poem for the occasion, but it has not yet been found, so it is not recorded here.

On the twenty-eighth day of the second month of the first year of *Qianfeng* (666 CE), a *jiwei* day, the emperor returned to the capital after completing the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai. He then traveled to Bozhou to pay homage at the temple of Laozi and posthumously bestowed the honorific title *Tai Shang Xuan Yuan Huang Di* upon him. The emperor’s own composition read:

*“The Great Dao, formless yet complete, predates the Two Modes and stands supreme. The Perfected One, emptying himself, speaks with wondrous subtlety of the myriad things. Consider Laozi: he is the root of Our lineage. From the time of Fuxi to the end of the Zhou, his numinous responses knew no form, his transformations took myriad paths. He ascended upon primordial qi, descended moved by the essence of the sun. At times, he roamed the cosmos, exhaling and inhaling wind and clouds; at others, he served as teacher and friend to emperors, his alchemical arts wondrously transforming. Like yin and yang, he is unfathomable; with the sun and moon, he endures. Yet when the celestial stems fell into decline and darkness neared the pillar beneath the hall, he greatly propagated his refined teachings, leaving a model for posterity. Though his heart equaled the Great Void, his principles returned to the True Sovereign.*

*As for transcending sageliness and abandoning wisdom, calming the spirit and diminishing desires, dwelling in the depths of stillness and obscurity, beyond the reach of sight and hearing—serene in non-action, at ease in self-possession—his was a draught that never ran dry, a use that never depleted. Grasping the Great Image to restore purity, cleansing the dark mirror to cast off burdens, he spans the cosmos in perpetuity, striding the potter’s wheel of creation to nurture all things. Perfect indeed! Truly, he defies all naming.*

*Moreover, the resources of the Great Sage ensured the flourishing of the imperial line; the footsteps of his supreme virtue marked an era of felicity. We, inheriting the numinous mandate, govern the multitudes. We unite the brightness of the Three Luminaries in reverent awe day and night, bear the weight of the Four Great Elements with solemn vigilance in waking and sleeping. We exhaust filial piety toward the ancestral shrines, extend harmonious grace to the seen and unseen, enact the transformation of purity and stillness, and inherit the enterprise of Great Peace. We ascend the sacred peak to perform the rites, sit in the Bright Hall to receive the records. Auspicious smoke gathers in celebration, repeated blessings descend. Cranes respond to the Nine Songs, mountains resound with ‘Long live the emperor!’ Surpassing all antiquity in felicitous omens, We stand foremost among the emperors of old.*

*After the grand rites concluded, We returned to the capital. Our carriage passed through Lai Xiang, and We personally offered libations of peppered wine. Gazing upon the auspicious wutong tree, We lingered in reverence; embracing the sacred spring, We sang in perpetuity. Our thoughts of ‘as if present’ run deep, and Our devotion to honoring the beginning grows ever more earnest. It is fitting to illuminate the profound mystery of the primordial origin and to manifest the merit of the Dark Sage. Let the posthumous title* Xuan Yuan Huang Di *be conferred, and let the Sage Mother be honored as* Xian Tian Tai Hou*. The temple halls shall all be repaired and rebuilt. A magistrate and vice-magistrate shall be appointed to oversee offerings and sacrifices.”*

Still, We decree that Guyang County be renamed Zhenyuan County.

In the fourth month, fourth day of the *yimao* year of the Yifeng era (7 April 678), an edict was issued dispatching the Daoist Zheng Yuanyin to the Pure Temple on Mount Yu in northern Luoyang, where he, together with Luo Wuxian and twenty-four others, established a fast and performed the Daoist rites. On the first day of the fifth month (3 June), at the hour of *chou*, as they reached the eastern gate of the hall, they beheld Lord Lao mounted upon a white horse with crimson mane, accompanied by two blue-robed youths, descending upon the altar. Auspicious light suffused the scene, and turning to the Daoist Kou Yidai, He spoke at length before vanishing.

The Supervisor of the Northern Palace Gardens, Gentleman for Court Audience Sun Rui, verified the hoofprints left upon the altar and promptly memorialized the throne. The hundred officials presented a memorial in celebration, declaring:

*“The August First Sovereign, the Dark Sage, manifested Himself at the temple precincts—His golden countenance and jade radiance outshone the brilliance of nocturnal luminaries; His white steed and vermilion mane left traces upon the celestial thoroughfare. The azure-clad youths, guiding at dawn, descended in accord with the jade chimes; purple clouds spread across the firmament, veiling the Silver River as He ascended on high. Thus is His legacy flourishing, His sacred mandate renewed, Our imperial sway expanded, and the light of His grace extended to all under Heaven. For this reason, the Dao surpasses the hundred kings, felicity abounds through ten thousand generations, the precious throne is eternally secured, and boundless prosperity is assured.”*

The Emperor was greatly pleased and decreed that henceforth Daoist priests should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Court of the Imperial Clan, ranking immediately after the imperial princes. Upon reviewing the memorial submitted by Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Spread Sun Rui.

In the third year of the Yifeng era, the fifth month, an edict was issued declaring that from that time forward, the *Dao De Jing* would be designated as the Supreme Classic, and all candidates for the imperial examinations must demonstrate proficiency in its teachings.

In the first year of the Wenming era of Empress Zetian, the jiashen year, Emperor Zhongzong was deposed and enfeoffed as the Prince of Luling, as the Empress sought to elevate the Wu clan. On the eighteenth day of the second month, a man from Yuzhang named Hao Yuanchong, bearing an imperial summons, arrived at the capital. When he reached Huangtianyuan in Longtaixiang, Que County, Haozhou, six immortals suddenly appeared, each riding a crimson dragon and clad in robes of varied hues. Two bore pearl-emblazoned banners, while four carried rainbow streamers and brocade parasols. Emerging from the multicolored clouds in the northwest, they leaned down and said to Yuanchong: “The Most High Lord Lao is coming.” With that, they passed by. Moments later, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air, and three azure-clad youths bearing incense burners glided past amidst the clouds. Then, two more azure-clad youths, each holding a red whisk and ruyi scepter, smiled as they passed.

Next, four immortals appeared, each riding a green dragon and bearing a tally of authority. They addressed Yuanchong: “The Most High Lord Lao is coming and wishes to speak with you.” No sooner had they spoken than they, too, passed by. Soon after, amidst the five-colored clouds, a Daoist appeared, clad in pale yellow robes, his hair and temples white. Upon his head rested a floral crown of golden hue, and he rode a white beast resembling a mule, its mane and tail aflame. Leaning down, he said to Yuanchong: “I am the Most High Lord Lao, the primal ancestor of your Emperor.” Yuanchong immediately prostrated himself, and the Lord Lao said: “Follow me, and I shall speak with you.” Before he knew it, Yuanchong found himself suspended in the clouds, several *zhang* above the earth.

The Lord Lao instructed him to convey this message to the Empress: “The mandate of my dynasty is enduring and far-reaching; you must not rashly enthrone a surname other than our own.” Behind him stood six immortals, each riding a dragon and girded with swords, their floral crowns resplendent and their robes of variegated hues gleaming brilliantly. They bore objects in hand, none of which Yuanchong could recognize, and stood in attendance to his left and right. Following them was a cloud chariot adorned with multicolored ornaments, upon which rested a great jeweled canopy with floral tassels cascading down, encircled by five-colored clouds. Countless attendants, some riding dragons and bearing tallies or banners, accompanied the procession, their forms towering and majestic. Music heralded their passage, and as they traveled, over five hundred officials, commoners, and residents of Que County witnessed the spectacle, all bowing in reverence from afar. In an instant, Yuanchong found himself back upon the earth.

Upon reaching Chang’an, he fully reported the encounter. The Empress was displeased and subsequently had him imprisoned.

Soon after, the temporary palace at Que County was established as Fengxian Abbey. Later, however, the Empress remained ever fearful of these words and dared not enthrone Wu Sansi. Ultimately, she restored the throne to Emperor Zhongzong, whereupon the reign era was changed to *Shenlong*. In the second year, it was again altered to *Jinglong*, and an edict was issued commanding every prefecture in the realm to establish a Jinglong Abbey, which was subsequently renamed *Zhongxing Abbey* and, in the third year, *Longxing Abbey*.

During the *Kaiyuan* era of Emperor Minghuang, an edict was issued stating: “In the *Wenming* years, Hao Yuanchong of Hongzhou transmitted the true instructions of the August Emperor of the Mysterious Origin to the Empress, declaring, ‘Our dynasty’s mandate shall endure without end, spanning ten thousand generations of rulers.’ For this, he was imprisoned and met his ruin. Had he not been a man of extraordinary loyalty and righteousness, who would not have shunned the penalty of death to defy the command of the divine spirits? He is worthy of posthumous honors to console his soul in the netherworld.” His son, Qiong, was also granted an official post commensurate with his rank.

The edict further proclaimed: “The late Hao Yuanchong of Hongzhou, in former times, responded to a propitious summons and arrived at Haolüe. There, he suddenly beheld the August Emperor of the Mysterious Origin, who lifted him into the clouded heavens and spoke with him, charging him to admonish the Empress and foretell the dynasty’s resurgence and the boundless span of its sacred destiny. He, disregarding his own life, came to transmit this decree, only to suffer imprisonment—truly a cause for lament. Had he not been one who exhausted his devotion to the court, who would have dared to confront authority in such a manner? He is fittingly granted posthumous honors to console his departed spirit.” He was posthumously appointed Prefect of Dizhou.

In the first year of the *Wansui Tongtian* era (the *Bingshen* year), the monk Huicheng of Fuxian Monastery in the Eastern Capital submitted a memorial requesting the destruction of the *Scripture of Laozi’s Conversion of the Barbarians*. An edict was issued to the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, who, together with the Director of the Hongwen Academy, deliberated on the matter. The Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Acting Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, and *Shangzhuguo* Liu Ruxuan presented his argument:

“The origins of Li and Śākya are one, never having been distinct. The Dharma-body and the Dao-essence manifest without limitation, descending in traces and bestowing numinous power, each enacting its own transformation. Moreover, Laozi emerged from the East and journeyed to the Western Regions. Though his ultimate fate remains unknown, his deeds are recorded in earlier histories. According to the *Book of the Later Han*, ‘Laozi entered the lands of the Yi and Di and transformed them into the teachings of the Buddha.’ The *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* states, ‘Laozi converted the customs of the Rong into those of the Buddha.’ The *Veritable Records of Our August Dynasty* recount: ‘Five hundred *li* west of Khotan lies the Vimalakīrti Monastery, built where Laozi converted the barbarians.’ There, Laozi ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Taking leave of the assembled barbarians, he declared, ‘Formerly, I wandered in the heavens, reviewing the registers of humans and spirits. Soon, I shall descend again.’ Thus, this monastery was established.

Upon examining the classics, the evidence shines forth clearly: the conversion of the barbarians is factual, and the scripture is not false. *Futu* is the Buddha, and the transformation of customs surely required a scripture. Yet the sages, in establishing teachings, respond to circumstances and act accordingly. Moreover, the natures of middling and superior persons differ, and the gates of Dao and Buddha open in accord with their dispositions. Is it not fitting that the two teachings flow together in vast harmony?”

The Gentleman for Court Audiences, Acting Right Reminder of the Hongwen Academy, Zhang Sidao, presented his argument:

“Lord Lao manifested in the Eastern Lands and disseminated his teachings in the West—events recorded in earlier texts, traces evident in past deliberations. The conversion of the barbarians is factual, and the scripture is not false. Its words encompass what preceded heaven and earth, its principles arise beyond the patterns of literary refinement. At times, it humbly engages with the world, thereby inaugurating the school of yielding and weakness.”

At times, he scrutinizes faults with unyielding clarity, thereby subduing the force of rigidity. Adapting teachings to circumstances, his sublime intent is beyond measure; prescribing remedies for afflictions, his sagely efficacy is unfathomable.

Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Service, Acting Palace Steward of the Heir Apparent and Concurrent Academician of the Hongwen Academy, Zhang Yuanjian, presented his argument:

“The Great Dao is all-pervading, responding to stimuli wherever they arise—be it among the Hu or the Han; it merely turns within this very body. Dwelling in the Central Lands, it spreads the true wind of purity and stillness; journeying to the Western Rong, it manifests wondrous transformations.”

Court Gentleman for Miscellaneous Uses, Acting Gentleman of the Curved Pantry of the Heir Apparent and Grand Pillar of State, Zhang Taiyuan, presented his argument:

“The Dao originated in the Central Lands, while the Buddha’s teachings descended in the Western Regions. Though teachings are established according to place, they share the same essence under different names. Moreover, Lord Lao’s transformations are boundless—now appearing in heaven as an emperor, now in the world as a master—revealing forms in accord with beings, his numinous responses beyond reckoning. Even if historical records lack evidence, the Buddha’s teachings differ not from Lord Lao’s.”

Supervisor of the Imperial University, Academician Wang Fanghui, presented his argument, citing the *Records of the Grand Historian*:

“When Laozi crossed the pass, he expounded the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand words to Yin Xi, then vanished without trace. Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: ‘Laozi cultivated qi, prized namelessness, and in time entered the Great Qin.’ Thus we know him as a true sage.”

Supervisor of the Imperial University, Erudite Wu Yanghao, presented his argument, citing the *Records of the Grand Historian*:

“Laozi was a man of Chu, who served as Archivist during the Shang era. When Confucius journeyed to Zhou to inquire about ritual, Laozi said: ‘The man of whom you speak has long since turned to dust; only his words remain. I have heard that a skilled merchant hides his wealth as if empty, while a gentleman of abundant virtue appears simple. Shed your arrogance and excess desires, for they profit you nothing. This is all I have to tell you.’ Confucius returned and told his disciples: ‘Today I saw Lord Lao—was he not like a dragon?’ When Laozi left the pass, Yin Xi said: ‘You are about to withdraw from the world; I beg you to write a book for me.’ Thereupon he composed the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand words, then vanished without trace. Some say he lived to one hundred and sixty, others to twelve hundred—none can verify it. Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* also states: ‘Laozi cultivated qi, prized namelessness, and in time entered the Great Qin.’ Thus we know him as a sage.”

Academician of the Hongwen Academy, Granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag, Yuan Banqian, presented his argument:

“According to Fan Ye’s *Biography of Pei Kai* in the *Later Han History*, the *Wei Chronicle’s Western Regions Transmission*, the *Northern History’s Western Regions Transmission*, and over ten other works from the Zhou, Sui, and other dynasties, all state that Laozi entered the Flowing Sands in the West, and all refer to his conversion of the Hu.”

Academician of the Hongwen Academy and Concurrent Reader-in-Waiting to the Various Princes, Cui Yuanwu, presented his argument:

“According to the Buddhist *Sutra of Universal Radiance and Auspicious Responses*, the *Long Āgama Sutra*, the *Record of the Middle Era*, the *Biographies of Eminent Recluses*, and over ten other works from the Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, Zhou, and Sui dynasties, all state that the Buddha was born in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, the *guisi* year, on the eighth day of the fourth month.”

On the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the first year of the *Wansui Tongtian* era, an imperial edict declared:

“Lord Lao’s conversion of the Hu is recorded in canonical pronouncements; how dare the monastic community presumptuously petition for its erasure? Thus we know that one-sided words cannot serve as evidence. Matters should be settled through balanced deliberation, and this assembly’s judgment is just. Even if historical records lack evidence, how could court officials falsely affirm it? Clearly, the conversion of the Hu is true, not false.”

According to the *Treatise on Bibliography* in the *New Tang History*, the *Bing* section records *A Memorial on the Laozi’s Conversion of the Hu Sutra* in one fascicle, stating:

“In the first year of the *Wansui Tongtian* era, the monk Huicheng submitted a memorial requesting the destruction of the *Laozi’s Conversion of the Hu Sutra*. An edict ordered the Minister of Justice, Liu Ruxuan, and others to deliberate. Ye Fashan was a native of Chuzhou. At the age of seven, he once fell into water, and his family believed him dead.”

Three years later, he returned. His parents asked the reason, and he replied: “A youth in blue led me to drink the cloud-nectar, then guided me to pay homage to the Most High Lord Lao. The Lord Lao received me and kept me there, which is why I was delayed.” By his twentieth year, he stood nine feet tall, his nature pure and unsullied, abstaining from meat. He often dwelled alone in secluded chambers or roamed forests and marshes. Upon returning from the immortal precincts, he had already mastered the arts of summoning and dispatching spirits, and so he divined a dwelling on the Mao-You Mountain. His gate stood near the mountain, a massive boulder blocking the path; the master cast a talisman, and in an instant the stone flew away, astonishing all who witnessed it.

Once, while traveling through Kuocang and Baima Mountain, he encountered three divine beings in a stone chamber, all clad in brocade robes and jeweled crowns. They addressed the master, saying: “We are commanded by the Most High Lord Lao to convey a secret decree to you. You are originally the Left Immortal Minister of the Purple Tenuity of the Great Ultimate, but for negligence in record-keeping, you were banished to the mortal realm. Swiftly establish merit, aid the people, and assist the state. When your merit is complete, you shall resume your former post. The Orthodox Unity, Three, and Five Methods are now bestowed upon you—strive diligently.” With these words, they departed. From then on, he subdued and eradicated malevolent spirits, ever making the salvation of others his purpose.

Emperor Gaozong summoned him to the capital and offered the rank of *Shangqing*, which he declined, instead requesting ordination as a Daoist priest. Empress Wu later summoned him to the divine capital. When Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne, Wu Sansi still held state power. The master, having frequently discerned portents and omens, protected Zhongzong, Prince Xiang, and the future Emperor Xuanzong. Resented by Sansi for this, he was exiled to Nanhai. After a year, he entered the Western Mountains of Hongzhou to cultivate his spirit and practice the Dao.

On the ninth day of the third month in the fourth year of the *Jinglong* era (a *xinhai* year), the three divine beings of Kuocang descended once more, conveying the command of the Most High Lord Lao: “You must assist Our Emperor Ruizong and the sagely sovereign of the *Kaiyuan* era. You cannot remain secluded in the mountains, neglecting your appointed duty.” With these words, they departed. At the time, neither emperor had yet ascended the throne, yet their temple names and reign titles were already foretold to him. In the eighth month of that year, an imperial edict indeed summoned him to court.

Later, after the pacification of Empress Wei, Prince Xiang was enthroned. Ruizong and Xuanzong succeeded to the throne in turn, and all matters of fortune or misfortune, movement or stillness, were invariably reported to him in advance. On one occasion, Tubo envoys presented a treasure, its casket inscribed: *“Let the Emperor open it himself; let no other know the secret.”* The court fell silent, save for Fashan, who said: *“This is an ill-omened casket. Bid the Tubo envoy open it himself.”* Xuanzong followed his counsel. When opened, a crossbow bolt sprang forth, killing the envoy—just as Fashan had foretold.

Shortly thereafter, he was appointed *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu*, *Honglu Qing* with concurrent duties, *Yueguo Gong*, and abbot of Jinglong Abbey. The account in the *Taiping Guangji* matches this precisely.

In the sixth month of the fourth year of the *Jinglong* era (a *gengxu* year), after the consort Wei murdered Zhongzong and usurped imperial authority, she further plotted against Ruizong.

At the time when Minghuang was Prince of Linzi, he plotted to quell the internal crisis but remained uncertain of its outcome. The Lord Lao then transformed himself into a white-robed elder, divining fortunes outside the Chunming Gate. The prince sought a divination, and suddenly a single stalk of millet soared forth, standing erect in midair. The elder laughed and said: *“This hexagram bodes well for seizing the throne and becoming emperor; all else is inauspicious. The advantage lies within three days.”* Thereupon, the prince, together with Liu Youqiu and Zhong Shaojing, finalized their plan to assassinate Empress Wei and enthrone Ruizong. He then ordered a search for the divining elder, but his whereabouts were unknown, nor did anyone realize he was the Lord Lao. A temple was erected on the site, named the “Divine Father Shrine,” with an inscription personally composed and calligraphed by the prince. The people of Chang’an continue to worship there to this day. *Record of Marvels in Luozhong*.

On the fifteenth day of the second month of the third year of the *Kaiyuan* era (a *dingmao* day), Minghuang designated the Lord Lao’s birthday as the Festival of the Mysterious Origin. He composed the *“Eulogy to the Mysterious Origin Emperor”*, which reads:

*Behold the supreme virtue,*
*Born to long years.*
*White locks hang like a minister’s cap,*
*Purple qi floats in the heavens.*
*Abiding in silent radiance,*
*Through endless kalpas unbroken.*
*Ancestor of all teachings,*
*Named the Mysterious Origin.*
*Eastward, he instructed Confucius;*
*Westward, he enlightened the Golden Immortals.*
*A hundred kings took him as their model,*
*His lineage transmitted through successive sages.*
*To the west of the Hangu Pass,*
*He left behind the Five Thousand Characters.*
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,*
*Mysterious, yet ever more mysterious.*

The emperor personally inscribed the eulogy in *hongfen* script on an eight-part red-lacquered tablet, placing it above the canopy of the Lord Lao’s hall. He issued an edict renaming Yangjiao Mountain as Longjiao Mountain, the temple as Qingtang Abbey, and composed an inscription for its stele. Statues of the six sage emperors—Gaozu, Taizong, Gaozong, Zhongzong, Ruizong, and Xuanzong—were sculpted and arrayed in attendance. Upon his return from the eastern feng sacrifice, the emperor paid homage to the Lord Lao at his former residence in Bozhou, personally transcribing the *Daode Jing* onto stone, erecting a great stele, constructing an octagonal tower, and covering it before the Hall of Emptiness and Non-Being.

In the first year (a *xinyou* year), a withered cypress at the Lord Lao’s former residence in Bozhou had stood for ages, and the Daoist priests intended to fell it. As they chopped the wood, each splinter bore five vermilion characters—*qian yuan heng li zhen*—in exquisitely precise strokes. The matter was reported to the throne, and the emperor decreed: *“The auspicious wood manifests numinous signs; wondrous script appears of its own accord. To proclaim great fortune and bless the grand design, it aligns the five virtues with the *Book of Changes* and welcomes ten thousand generations of propitious destiny. Offer sincere thanks and report this to the historiographers.”* The splinters were stored in the imperial treasury and bestowed upon the imperial princes, chief ministers, and Daoist clergy.

In the third month, a stone stele was erected at Jinglong Abbey, and the emperor commanded the Daoist priest Sima Chengzhen of Mount Tiantai to inscribe the Lord Lao’s *Daode Jing* in the three scripts of Cai Yong’s stone classics. Today, a lacquered version remains at Chongdao Abbey on Mount Tiantai, also transcribed by Ziming himself.

In the eleventh year (a *guihai* year), the prefecture of Pu reported that during the construction of the Mysterious Origin Temple, a jade stone shaped like a half-moon was unearthed, its reverse depicting an immortal pounding medicine. When struck, its sound was clear and resonant. The emperor ordered it sent to the Mysterious Origin Abbey in Taiyuan Prefecture, naming it the “Recumbent Moon Chime,” to be struck only during purification and offering rites. Later, Zhang Qi, the military governor of the eastern capital, reported that during the renovation of the Ancient Abbey of Immortal Residence in Lushan County, Ruzhou, a jade chime was discovered, its sound audible for miles. It was ordered placed in the Hall of the Sacred Ancestor at Taiqing Palace for use in the altar of purification rites—now classified among the “cloud plates.”

During the construction of an abbey in Quzhou, a fish three feet long was unearthed while digging. It resembled iron, with a faint purple-green hue, its luster like jade, its carving seemingly beyond human craft. When struck, it resonated deeply. Unable to identify the fish, it was presented to the court. The emperor displayed it to his officials, but none could recognize it. He then named it the “Auspicious Fish Chime” and ordered it placed in Taiwei Abbey, to be struck during purification lectures. Thereafter, abbeys and temples competed to replicate it in wood and stone as a means to assemble the faithful. The use of wooden fish in abbeys and temples began from this time.

In the ninth month of the fourteenth year, an edict proclaimed: *“The Mysterious Origin Emperor, the divine and sagely patriarch, is the ancestral root of our dynasty. In the earliest chaos, he revealed the mandate of heaven. Gaozu responded, and thus a temple was established at the site of his descent, the county renamed Divine Mountain. Recently, the temple courtyard has repeatedly manifested auspicious signs. Reverently bearing the numinous response, we rejoice deeply. Let the prefecture select seven devout Daoist priests to purify themselves, burn incense, and offer reverence at the temple on Longjiao Mountain.”*

On the eighth day of the fourth month of the seventeenth year, a vegetarian feast was held at the newly established Xinxing Convent in Xinjin County, Shuzhou. A Daoist priest arrived late and took his seat. The assembled monks slighted him and did not offer food. The Daoist slowly rose, entered the main hall, and did not emerge for a long time. After the feast concluded, the monks entered the hall to search for him, but no trace remained.

Suddenly, a divine image emerged within the temple pillar, its form concealed yet distinct. When carved with a knife, it became even more refined and exquisite. The eyebrows, whiskers, and hair were as delicate as if painted, wearing a floral coronet and rosy garments. Upon the coronet rested an object resembling a mandarin duck. Beneath the square-toed shoes, lotus flowers appeared, and behind the flowers, a lotus leaf, upon which sat a tortoise. Behind the left elbow, within a cloud-like lotus flame, a dragon’s head manifested. Before the right shoulder, a tiger turned its gaze to the left. Surrounding the entire body was a radiant flame, with cloud leaves and celestial flowers above, and a great flower like a canopy shading the form.

Zhang Jingzhong, Chief Administrator of the Yi Prefecture Grand Protectorate, memorialized: *“Within the jurisdiction of this office, at the Xinxing Convent in Xinjin County, Shuzhou, a natural wood grain in the pillar of the Buddha hall has subtly risen to form the sacred image of the Venerable Lord Lao. Atop the head is a floral canopy, and beneath the feet, before and behind, thirteen instances of cloud leaves and celestial flowers appear.”*

The appointed investigating officer, Wang Dazhong, verified and reported, together with Shuzhou Prefect Li Zhongxun, Vice Prefect Lu Fang, County Magistrate Li Shao, Daoist priests, Buddhist monks, and nuns—one hundred thirty persons in all—that: *“The natural wood grain has indeed revealed a true visage, divinely near and wondrously subtle. The more it was washed and carved, the clearer it became—beyond what painting could achieve, beyond what carving could attain.”*

We humbly submit that the Most High Lord Lao, the Great Sage of Primordial Heaven, is ever-changing and unpredictable, his hidden manifestations unfathomable. It is further said: *“Auspicious flowers encircle it, their fragrance unceasing; the floral canopy floats above, its luminous treasure ever noble. Manifesting upon the temple pillar, it seems to mark the year of the Historian’s Record; illuminating the Buddhist shrine, it faintly recalls the day of the Hu-conversion. Though the phoenix nested in the Xuanyuan Hall, and the qilin crouched in the Zhou court, how could they compare to the descent of the Divine Ancestor and the mandate borne by his sagely descendant?”*

We beseech that this be joyfully recorded in the Nine Ancestral Temples, its glory matched to the Two Principles, inscribed by the historiographers, and proclaimed throughout the realm.

On the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month, the eunuch Lin Zhaoyin was dispatched to Shu to retrieve the image-pillar. A precious palanquin was prepared, and upon its arrival in the capital, it was installed in the Great Harmony Hall for three days of reverent obeisance. After the grand vegetarian feast concluded, the Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues was ordered to transfer it to the Eastern Brightness Abbey for display and veneration, permitting both officials and commoners to pay their respects. It was then decreed that the Daoist abbeys of the Two Streets each host it for seven days before returning it to the palace.

The imperial edict proclaimed: *“The Dao’s essence is boundless; the Primordial Origin responds. Its form appears in the pillar of the Historian, its name timely in Xinxing. The ancestral temples bestow favor; the living beings receive blessing. Let it be recorded in the Historiographer’s Office and announced to the four quarters.”*

In the tenth month of the eighteenth year, the Emperor commanded Chen Xilie, Academician of the Jixian Institute, and others to lecture on the *Daoist Scripture of Virtue and Power* in the Three Palaces. The President of the Chancellery, Pei Guangting, memorialized: *“Yao and Shun governed through deference, while Tang and Wu rose by force of arms. Some wearied their spirits and bodies, others taxed their minds with anxiety. Though the living kind may have glimpsed a measure of peace, the wind of non-action has yet to attain the Great Dao. Now Your Majesty’s transformative governance has harmonized with the mysterious Dao, diminishing the nearness of action while magnifying the teaching of wordless instruction. This is to cast aside ornament and return to the root, to strip away falsity and preserve truth. Such a path lies only in the realm of virtue and power, firmly within the arts of Laozi and Zhuangzi.”*

Thereupon, the Emperor commanded Chen Xilie, Academician of the Jixian Institute and Drafter of the Secretariat; Wang Jiongzhi, Remonstrance Advisor; Kang Ziyuan, Vice Minister of the Court of the Imperial Clan and Lecturer-in-Waiting; and Feng Chaoyin, Grand Master for Exemplary Service, to attend lectures in the Three Palaces, expounding the true scripture and elucidating the Seven Sages of Xiangcheng and the Four Masters of Gushan. In governance, may the wind of purity and stillness prevail; in self-cultivation, may the way of long life and enduring vision be attained. The sagely transformation and mysterious mandate bring joy and peace to the realm, so that all live by it unawares—a rarity unseen in ages past. As one unworthy of my office, I humbly request that this be inscribed in the historical records and proclaimed throughout the land.

The Emperor responded by hand: *“I reverently uphold the ancestral succession and humbly bear the mandate of heaven, ever vigilant day and night, fearful of inadequacy. I seek worthy ministers to entrust with counsel, and extend invitations to learned scholars to consult their vast knowledge, that they may support my shortcomings and harmonize all things. Within, there is peace; without, there is accomplishment. Punishments are just, and lawsuits cease. With leisure in my serene repose, I turn my attention to the classics. I hold that the Dao is the mystery of mysteries, and virtue the foundation of teaching and transformation. By lecturing on its subtle meanings and examining its secret texts, may governance be achieved through non-action, and things respond without coercion. How dare I compare my virtue to Yao and Shun, or measure my achievements against Yu and Tang? Yet I must first rectify my heart, deeply reflecting on what is distant and near, striving to unify customs and extend this to the myriad people. Only if all return to purity and stillness, and together uphold the profound silence, will the compilation and proclamation you propose be truly timely.”*

On the night of the fifteenth day of the second lunar month in the nineteenth year, the Emperor dreamed of a divine being who addressed him, saying: “I am the Messenger of the Nine Heavens, sent by the Jade Emperor of the Primordial True One—who is none other than your ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao. He has commanded me to oversee the Three Realms, Ten Directions, Nine Heavens, and Nine Earths as the Inspector-General of the Turning Wheel. The Director of Destinies of the Nine Heavens resides in the hidden mountains of Shu; the Venerable Elder of the Nine Heavens dwells in the Azure City of Shu; and I abide on Mount Lu by the Jiang. Temples may be erected in these three places. Five hundred years hence, blessings shall extend to all living beings.”

At dawn, the Emperor rose, burned incense, and bowed in gratitude toward the empty sky. Suddenly, the divine figure reappeared amidst the clouds, attended by an ethereal retinue. He commanded Wu Daozi to depict the vision as seen, and dispatched envoys bearing tribute to the three mountains to establish shrines.

On the first day of the spring month in the twenty-first year, the cyclical day *gengzi*, an edict was issued: “Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* should be kept in every household of scholars and commoners. Each year, candidates for the imperial examinations shall be tested on one or two passages from the *Book of Documents* or the *Analects*, with an equal number of questions on the *Dao De Jing*, so as to honor the root of the Dao and broaden the wellspring of transformation. This present decree should likewise be kept in every home, to be reflected upon thrice daily, that my intent may be known.”

The Vice-Director of the Chancellery, Pei Guangting, and others memorialized: “We have witnessed Your Majesty’s recent edict, instructing the hundred officials and extending to the myriad people. Your sagely grace is vast and boundless, your virtue and beneficence like heaven itself. Having nurtured all life, you now exhort and encourage, so that none fail to turn toward goodness, all knowing the proper direction. Though unworthy, we serve at the pivot of governance, yet have done little to advance the common good. Suddenly, we receive this celestial favor, as if scales had fallen from our eyes. Even the august sovereigns of high antiquity—Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Yao, and Shun—could not surpass this. The realm is most fortunate. We humbly request that this be recorded in the national history, to be shown to future generations.”

The Emperor assented, replying by edict: “The teachings of the Primordial True One are the foundation of family and state. Not merely to honor my ancestors, but to uphold the root of the Dao, I have chosen the first day of the new year, the beginning of spring, to issue this decree on governance through purity and stillness, trusting that the chief ministers will carry it out. In selecting officials, one should first seek those of simple and unadorned virtue.”

In the twelfth month, the Lecturer-in-Waiting Chen Xilie and others concluded their recitation of the classics. The Vice-Director of the Chancellery and concurrent Director of the Chancellery and Department of State Affairs, Pei Yaoqing, and others memorialized: “We have witnessed Your Majesty’s completion of the *Book of Documents*, the *Book of Changes*, the *Dao De Jing*, and the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi. Your sagely heart embraces the Dao; your imperial instruction exalts the Confucian tradition. The profound influence of the Dao now reaches far, beginning anew from this moment. Moreover, your concerns extend to the four seas, your thoughts to the ten thousand regions. Each day after the morning audience, you retire to the inner palace to study the classics; with the wind at your back, you open the way for the people, even lecturing in the traveling palace. Not even the Han emperors in a single night could surpass this. Having grasped the essence of Laozi and Zhuangzi, you act with benevolence and forbearance, aligning all things. With the heart of Yao and Shun, you examine antiquity and establish models for governance. Though you delve deeply, your progress is swift without haste. You harmonize the myriad beings, bringing joy to all things. Your great plans illuminate the records of history, their brilliance enduring. Though unworthy, we have been privileged to offer counsel and receive your august words. Our joy and reverence are beyond measure. We humbly request that this be proclaimed by the court historians, that your glorious deeds may be celebrated.”

The Emperor replied by hand: “The *Book of Documents* is refined and solemn; the *Book of Changes* is subtle and profound. From childhood, I studied under teachers but have not yet plumbed their deepest meanings, hence my frequent lectures. As for the *Dao De Jing*, its layers unfold endlessly. Examining its intent, one finds countless connections. Having inquired into the Way of Guangchengzi, I have also gained the guidance of Fangming. In this age, such an opportunity comes but once in a thousand years. Thus, I have expounded these principles to enlighten you.”

The civil and military officials, led by the Right Chancellor and Academician of the Jixian Institute, Xiao Song, and others memorialized: “Since last year, by Your Majesty’s edict, the Academicians of the Jixian Institute—Vice Minister of Works Chen Xilie, Remonstrance Official Wang Jiongzhi, and Director of the Bureau of Sacrifices Feng Chaoyin—have daily attended lectures on the *Dao De Jing* of the Primordial August Emperor, as well as the *Book of Changes*, the *Book of Documents*, and the *Zhuangzi*, concluding on the twenty-fourth day of this month. We have heard that Yao gathered the texts of former ages to perfect his sagacity, and Shun observed the images of antiquity to manifest his wisdom. Thus, we know that the Dao is worthy of reverence, and ritual forgets its own nobility. Not merely to assemble learning, but to guide the people. Your Majesty’s wisdom is truly divine, your actions truly sagely. The influence of the Dao is perfectly harmonious; cultural instruction is fully realized. Yet you still seek to broaden your knowledge and accumulate learning, examining antiquity in all matters, delving into the subtleties of the classics. You honor your ancestors by studying the scriptures of Laozi, embodying heaven by observing the images of the *Book of Changes*. You pursue the teachings of Guangchengzi through the chapters of Zhuangzi, and investigate the old rites of the Tang through the *Canon of Yao*. Recently, you offered sacrifices to the Earth Goddess in the north and traveled to the hot springs in the east. Though the land was crossed by wind and sand, or the sky threatened with cold and snow, the lecture hall was always convened, the traveling palace unchanged. This suffices to show your love of learning and your diligent virtue. Even Fu Xi’s drawing of the trigrams or Yu’s reception of the scriptures cannot compare. Though unworthy, we stand in the court and have heard the imperial Way. We humbly request that this be recorded by the court historians and proclaimed throughout the realm.”

The Emperor replied by hand: “I have heard that the Academicians of the Jixian Institute, after the morning audience, regularly engage in lectures on the Confucian and Daoist classics—this is their usual duty. Over the months and years, I have studied their chapters and verses. The refined admonitions of the *Book of Documents* are examined in light of antiquity and tested against the present. The *Dao De Jing* is drawn from the true and does not exalt its own teachings. Is this not the essence of governing the state? Let it be recorded by the court historians, as you have requested.”

On the *guiwei* day of the third month in the twenty-third year, the Emperor personally annotated the *Laozi* and composed an exegesis in eight fascicles, along with the *Kaiyuan Textual Phonology* in thirty fascicles. These were distributed to the public officials, scholars, commoners, and the Daoist and Buddhist communities, with instructions to offer candid opinions on their merits.

The civil and military officials, led by the Right Chancellor Xiao Song, memorialized: “In accordance with Your Majesty’s edict, we have consulted all offices and disseminated the texts to Daoists and Buddhists. The reports we have received all affirm that the profound words delve into subtleties, and the compilation of characters is comprehensive and harmonious. Once published, they will serve as a model for future generations, revering your sagely regulations. Observing the mysterious and knowing the constant, they embody the essence of the sacred altar. Long-standing doubts and past errors are corrected in every detail, fully illuminating the teachings of the Dao and extending the influence of Confucianism. Having already transformed the people, they also establish the foundation. We are deeply fortunate.”

Though diverse interpretations were sought and the celestial will awaited, the realm shares a single script and a unified discourse—no alternative phrasing need be considered. We humbly request that these be compiled into the historical records and preserved in the imperial archives.” The Emperor granted his approval.

In the twelfth month of the twenty-seventh year, the chief ministers Niu Xianke and Li Linfu memorialized: “We have reverently observed the Crown Prince conveying Your Majesty’s virtuous decree to the Historiographer’s Office. We have learned that on the fifth day of the previous month, as Your Majesty prepared to tour the northern banks of the Wei River, that very night you dreamed of the August First Emperor of the Mysterious Origin, who said: ‘Tomorrow, my child, do you intend to journey north? The spirits are not present there—this matter should be halted. At the fifth watch, there shall be a sign.’ And he added: ‘You have already reigned for many years—why must it be this day?’ Your Majesty then issued an edict at the second watch to cancel the northern tour of the Wei. At the fifth watch, a fierce gale indeed arose, subsiding only at dusk.

We reflect that no virtue surpasses the imperial standard in embodying the numinous truth, and no governance excels that of our August Emperor. Thus, through profound resonance, the sagely and the divine converge. Unfathomable words foretold an inevitable outcome: the violent winds confirmed the prophetic dream. This not only manifests the longevity of Your Majesty’s reign but also heralds boundless blessings—enduring as heaven and earth, as certain as a tally’s verification. From the dawn of civilization, we have scoured the annals and examined the omens: never has there been a sign so luminously evident as this.

We, unworthy as we are to serve near the throne and to hold the office of historiographer, have been privileged to witness this virtuous decree. Our joy knows no bounds.”

In the fourth month of the twenty-eighth year, the Emperor dreamed that Lord Lao said: “I have an image located over a hundred *li* southwest of the capital. Send someone to seek it, for I shall meet you at the Palace of Flourishing Celebration, where great fortune awaits you.” The following day, he addressed his chief ministers: “For nearly thirty years since ascending the throne, I have never failed to rise at cock’s crow to pay reverent homage to the true visage and pray for the people’s blessings. Recently, while offering such homage before dawn had broken, I sat in quiet meditation and dozed. There, the August First Emperor appeared and dispatched an emissary, along with the Daoist master of ceremonies Xiao Yuanyu, to search. They arrived at the Louguan Temple on Mount Zhongnan in Aowuwu County, where they beheld purple clouds descending and a white radiance connecting earth to heaven. Digging beneath, they indeed discovered a jade image of Lord Lao, over three *chi* in height, which they presented to me.

That very day, I happened to be at the Palace of Flourishing Celebration, where I personally received and enshrined the image in the inner hall. It was exactly as I had seen in my dream. I then commanded the chief ministers to view it, who subsequently submitted a memorial of congratulation: ‘The Great Sage of the Mysterious Origin has manifested his true visage—a sign of resonance that truly accords with Your Majesty’s sagely virtue. You embody the Way of utmost truth and honor the source of purity and stillness. How could you not offer reverent prayers for the people’s blessings? Thus, the true visage appeared in your dream, and the august ancestor displayed his numinous power. The search to the southwest confirmed the dream’s promise.

Moreover, the Palace of Flourishing Celebration was once the former residence of the Dragon’s Portent, where the imperial enterprise was founded. That the meeting was foretold in this place, coinciding with its auspicious name, signifies that this image descends from the Purple Palace to guard our imperial house, inaugurating boundless blessings and fulfilling the promise of great fortune. Your Majesty has now consecrated the main hall as a dharma sanctuary—an act of utmost reverence and veneration. Such extraordinary rites shall bring myriad blessings, extending beyond all bounds to encompass the multitudes in shared celebration.

What fortune is ours to have personally witnessed and paid homage! The image’s sublime features defy description. Since the dawn of time, no such event has been recorded in the annals. We humbly request that this be proclaimed throughout the realm and inscribed in the imperial records.’”

The Emperor responded by hand with an edict, saying: “That which is true in dreams is called communion with the divine. Now the sacred countenance has indeed responded to sincerity—how could this be due to my virtue, when it is the great Dao that thus flourishes? Reflecting again on the numinous presence, its words still ring in my ears, promising blessings and merits that shall multiply with each generation. At first, it was announced that the divine would appear in the temporary palace, yet it manifested directly within the inner hall, coinciding with this great celebration, which rightly belongs to my person alone. Consulting the Daoist scriptures, I find this to be a treasure. It is fitting that I nurture the myriad people and repay the divine luminosity.

You, my esteemed ministers, should share my intent: let us proclaim this auspicious response, for how could I dare to decline? On the day *gengxu* of the fifth month, I commanded the relevant officials to depict the true countenance and distribute it throughout the realm. Thereupon, I issued this edict:

The great Dao, formless and complete, precedes heaven and earth. The sages established its teachings to illuminate the ultimate origin, thereby unfolding its wondrous essence and broadly aiding living beings, awakening those of steadfast intent and guiding the lost back to the Way. In thus saving all things, none are abandoned. Who, then, is most worthy of this? None but our illustrious ancestor, the August Prime Emperor of the Mysterious Origin.

I have inherited this sacred enterprise and further expounded the profound Dao. Since ascending the throne, I have, without fail, day and night, purified my thoughts and concentrated my mind, fasting in body and spirit to pay homage before the true countenance. Before dawn, I complete these rites, and this has continued for nearly thirty years—all for the sake of the common people, to pray for abundant blessings. Yet I never imagined that my humble sincerity would reach above, and the sagely visage would deign to observe me. Recently, in a moment of rest, I suddenly dreamed of the true countenance. Upon waking, its radiant form remained before me, its sublime features natural and in perfect accord with the dream. Truly, it has secretly descended from the immortal realm to eternally guard the mortal world, announcing to me boundless blessings. Its virtuous voice still resounds in my ears, revealing to me this extraordinary fortune.

Since the numinous has set its appointed time, and the vast heavens have mysteriously aided it, the ancestral altars and the state shall store up blessings—how could my meager virtue have brought about such an event? To leave it unaddressed would be to neglect reverence. Therefore, I command the relevant officials to immediately copy the true countenance and send it to the Investigating Commissioners of all circuits, who shall then deliver it to the Kaiyuan Temples in each prefecture for installation. The Daoist priests in each locale shall prepare with full ritual decorum to receive it. For seven days and nights after the image’s arrival, they shall hold vegetarian feasts and perform the Daoist rites, and I shall grant funds to each temple to cover the expenses.

From this day forward, let the study and recitation of Daoist scriptures be regularly practiced to elucidate their subtle meanings. The establishment of Daoist academies must be redoubled, with increased encouragement to ensure their flourishing. For the profound truth is vast and far-reaching, and its propagation depends on people. Without such promotion, how can customs be uplifted?

Among all classes of people, those well-versed in the *Daode Jing*, *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Wenzi*, and the like shall be sought out by local officials and reported by name. I shall personally examine them and bestow special rewards.

Now, the true countenance has manifested—an event unheard of in ancient times. Though its blessings first belong to the state and the imperial house, its joy should be shared equally among officials and commoners. To the imperial princes, princesses, commandery and county ladies, and all civil and military officials within and beyond the court, I shall grant money according to rank. On days of rest and leisure, let them partake in simple meals to express their celebratory joy. The military commissioners and their officers in all circuits shall be treated likewise. The elders of the two capitals and all prefectures shall also receive money to share in this festive banquet, the funds drawn from local government stores.

You, my ministers, from the highest to the humblest, should strive to honor the transformation of the Dao and together restore the wellspring of purity. Let this be proclaimed far and wide, that all may understand my intent.

I have heard it said in the *Doctrine of the Mean*: ‘Sincerity takes form, and form becomes manifest.’ Dreams, too, are the manifestation of sincerity. When King Gaozong of Shang, reverent and silent, pondered the Dao, he dreamed of the Lord on High granting him a worthy assistant—and indeed, he found one. Tradition holds that the August Ming Emperor, in his frequent reverence before the true countenance, was moved to dream of it—such is the manifestation and revelation of sincerity. Yet when he grew weary of governance and entrusted power to unworthy men, it led to the calamity of the Hu barbarians. Some compare him to the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, claiming their downfalls stemmed from their devotion to the Dao. This I find deeply perplexing.

The Dao is rooted in a pure heart and few desires, and its function lies in aiding others and benefiting all things. Yet these three rulers indulged their inner desires and recklessly waged war, merely seeking through prayers and sacrifices to attain immortality—how could they have succeeded? Consider Emperor Wu of Liang, who exhausted the state’s resources to build pagodas and temples, offered his own body and life as a servant to monks, renounced all joy in the six palaces, and abolished sacrifices in the seven ancestral temples. He personally lectured on the Buddha Maitreya and the living Buddha, with the sage monk Baozhi as his protector—yet he still could not escape the disaster at Taicheng. Could this, too, be blamed on his devotion to the Dao?

On the day *dingchou* of the first month of the twenty-ninth year *xinsi*, I issued this edict: In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the people were simple and honest, for their rulers transformed them through the Dao. Thereafter, governance diverged. Our illustrious ancestor, the August Prime Emperor of the Mysterious Origin, possessed the virtue of a great sage and embodied the essence of the supreme Dao. He composed the Five Thousand Characters to correct the ills of the age, offering a means to govern the state that transcends the *Book of Changes* and the *Appended Judgments*, surpassing even the most eloquent words. I have decreed that every household study this text, that people may turn toward the right path and governance may be achieved without coercion.

Yet I fear that lesser scholars may not grasp its subtle words, so I have further elucidated it to help them awaken, recover from their weaknesses, and perpetuate boundless goodness. In the two capitals and all circuits, let one temple to the August Prime Emperor be established, where annual Daoist fasts and offerings shall be conducted according to ritual. Additionally, let Academies of the August Mystery be founded, with students drawn proportionally from the existing prefectural schools. They shall study the *Daode Jing*, *Zhuangzi*, *Wenzi*, and *Liezi*. Upon completing their studies, they shall be sent to the capital each year for examination, following the precedent for the *mingjing* degree.

Each academy shall appoint one teaching assistant, selected by the local prefect from among all classes of people after careful consideration, and they shall receive modest additional rewards.

In this month, the prefecture of Bozhou reported that in the temple of the August Prime Emperor, nine wells emitted qi that formed clouds, their five colors shimmering in harmony.”

On the *xinmao* day of the second month, the Emperor composed the *Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Plumes Melody* and the *Purple Tenuity Eight Trigrams Dance* to offer at the Great Clarity Palace, esteeming them above the Nine Temples. He also visited the Kaiyuan Abbey in Huaizhou and the Fengxian Abbey in Quexiang at the request of the princes, nobles, and common people, personally paying homage to the two scriptures of the *Daode Jing*. He had great stone steles erected facing each other, following the model of the Great Clarity Palace.

In the ninth month, from the Xingqing Gate tower, the Emperor personally examined candidates for the *Daode Jing*, *Zhuangzi*, *Wenzi*, and *Liezi* degrees. The imperial examination stated: “In my leisure from governance, I often read the *Daode Jing*, *Wenzi*, *Liezi*, and *Zhuangzi*. Their texts are concise yet profound in meaning, their words lofty yet far-reaching in intent. They can order the state and preserve the self. I revere and uphold their teachings to guide the people. You, scholars, who devote yourselves to these texts—I greatly commend you.

Yet the needs of past and present differ, and literary and substantive styles alternate. If one were to govern with non-interference and not act upon external things, implementing the transformations of high antiquity would not suit the way of ruling today. The defense of the times lies in adapting to what is fitting.

Moreover, rites, music, punishments, and governance are the warp of the state, while sagacity, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness order human relations. If these were abandoned, their purpose would remain unknown. The *Daode Jing* says, ‘Cut off learning and there will be no sorrow,’ which contradicts the teachings of advancing virtue and cultivating conduct. The *Liezi*’s *Power and Fate* says, ‘What merit have you in things?’—this violates the texts of punishing evil and encouraging good. Which of these two principles is incorrect? Which is superior, and which inferior? The *Wenzi* says, ‘Gold accumulates and edges wear away; jade is layered and never exhausted,’ fully expounding its meaning. The *Zhuangzi* says, ‘Tranquility and knowledge mutually nourish each other,’ clearly verifying its words. If one principle could unify all, and both teachings could be jointly upheld, they would become unchanging norms, entrusted to the contemplation of the empty and expectant mind.”

Candidates such as Yao Ziyan, Zhan Neng, and Yuan Zai passed the examination and were each appointed to office.

In the twelfth month, the Emperor issued an edict: “I constantly think of the common people, never forgetting them even in sleep, hoping their households may be sufficient and prosperous, rich and long-lived. The great method of aiding and saving them lies in none other than the Daoist teachings. The Celestial Sage left models, and his subtle words shine resplendently. Following and practicing them, how distant could their response be? Moreover, as the year approaches its end and all things begin to stir, aligning with the harmony of yang, some may yet be preserved through kindness and nurture. It is fitting to command all abbeys throughout the realm, from the first day of the new year until its close, to continuously recite the *Scripture of the Fundamental Boundary*—a text revealed by Lord Lao to enrich the state and pacify the people.

The granddaughter of the Celestial Master of Han, Yulan, dreamed of a red light descending from heaven into her mouth and awoke pregnant. People doubted her, so she split open her abdomen to prove her innocence. An object like a lotus flower emerged from her belly, within which was a golden seal and a plain silk scroll—this was the scripture.

On the *jiayin* day of the first month of the Tianbao era, purple clouds suddenly descended outside the Vermilion Phoenix Gate. Lord Lao, riding a white horse, with two pairs of attendant immortal youths, stood upon the clouds. He addressed the Court Gentleman of the Prince’s Household, Tian Tongxiu, saying: ‘When I departed with Yin Xi for the Flowing Sands, I concealed a golden casket with a numinous talisman in the former residence of Yin Xi at the old pass of Peach Grove. You may report this to the Emperor so he may retrieve it and use it to guard the state.’

Tongxiu relayed this, and the Emperor dispatched the palace attendant Li Zhizhong to supervise Tongxiu in seeking it at the former site of Hangu Pass, south of Taolin County in Shanzhou. Suddenly, a purple cloud and a white hare appeared beneath a withered mulberry tree west of Yin Xi’s old residence. They dug by hand, reaching the water’s edge, where they found a stone casket and a golden coffer inscribed with fine red seal script on jade tablets. The Emperor ordered the Ten Divisions of Music to welcome the sacred talisman through the northern gate into the imperial carriage. From within, five-colored light radiated, illuminating heaven and earth.”

The Emperor ascended the Vermilion Phoenix Tower, clad in mourning robes and imperial crown, holding golden incense burners, and bowed to welcome and enshrine it in the Hall of Numinous Radiance. That night, divine lamps appeared upon the towers, pavilions, and trees, as well as in the empty void above.

At this time, all civil and military officials, along with the imperial clansmen, Daoist and Buddhist followers, and household disciples, submitted memorials, stating that the auspicious talisman’s resonance had manifested, the sacred treasure of the revolving coffer had been revealed, its hidden response aligning with the reign title, preceding heaven without contradiction. They wished to exalt the Emperor’s honorific title to illuminate the canonical rites. The Emperor firmly declined. After repeated memorials were submitted, on the *renshen* day, he issued an edict:

“The descent of the divine blessing must be reciprocated with rites, and in perpetuating the ancestral sacrifices, one must attend in person. Since assuming the throne, I have broadly propagated the Daoist teachings, venerating the transformation of purity and admonition, and spreading the wind of the Mysterious Origin, hoping that its blessings might extend to the common people and the realm attain longevity. Through the years, I have never slackened in diligence. How could my humble sincerity have moved the response, causing the August Ancestor to descend and manifest the numinous mandate, bestowing the sacred talisman? Having sought it in accordance with the words, it was obtained as foretold. Upon its arrival, extraordinary signs indeed appeared. Truly, the mysteries of the Way are ineffable. Yet such a great blessing for the state—how could anything surpass it? This reveals that what the immortals seal, the workings of creation likewise secure. From the beginning, it awaited the revolving coffer for many years, and now the response to the change of reign title aligns as if by tally. The favor of this propitious fortune inspires profound reverence.

Yet the officials, imperial clansmen, and the heir apparent with his brothers have repeatedly petitioned from without, while the black-robed and yellow-robed elders, along with the venerable, have ceaselessly entreated within, wishing to adopt the name *Tianbao* (‘Heavenly Treasure’) in place of *Kaiyuan* (‘Inaugural Origin’). Considering my own inadequacy, how could I be worthy? However, the profound instructions of the Way demand reverent compliance, and the will of the people cannot be refused. To follow heaven and yield to the multitude accords with the principle of supreme impartiality. Respectfully accepting their request, I am deeply humbled. This is all due to the boundless generosity of the Supreme Mystery, the efficacious protection of the hundred spirits, and the harmonious assistance of the August Ancestor, who in hidden accord has renewed the mandate and clearly manifested the omen of eternal prosperity. It is fitting to observe the sacrificial canons and duly offer thanksgiving.”

Thus, on the fifteenth day of the coming month, it was decreed to enshrine the talisman in the Temple of the Mysterious Origin Emperor. Thereupon, the Temple of the Sacred Emperor of the Mysterious Origin was established in the Great Tranquility Ward, its eastern capital located at the former residence in Accumulated Virtue Lane.

On the *xinmao* day of the second month, the Mysterious Origin Emperor was venerated at the new temple, and the capital observed a prohibition on slaughter. On the *bingshen* day, Zhuangzi was posthumously honored as the Perfected Person of Southern Florescence. On the *gengzi* day, the Emperor said: “Since Zhuangzi is now titled the Perfected Person of Southern Florescence, let the works of Wenzi, Liezi, and Gengsangzi be further deliberated by the Secretariat-Chancellery for report.”

The chief ministers memorialized: “Since Zhuangzi is honored as the Perfected Person of Southern Florescence, let Wenzi be titled the Perfected Person of Penetrating Mystery, Liezi the Perfected Person of Empty Vacuity, and Gengsangzi the Perfected Person of Cavernous Spirit. May their works likewise be designated as *True Scriptures*.” This was approved.

On the twentieth day of the month, an edict was issued: “The August Heaven has favored our mandate, and the August Ancestor has descended in spirit. The rites of auspicious manifestation must be preserved in the sacrificial canons. Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Liezi, and Gengsangzi are ranked among the perfected immortals, embodying the empty clarity of the Way. They propagated the sacred teachings of the Mysterious Origin, broadly disseminating the great Dao among humankind. Their subtle words delve into the profoundest meanings, surpassing all other masters in unparalleled excellence. Henceforth, Zhuangzi shall be titled the Perfected Person of Southern Florescence, Wenzi the Perfected Person of Penetrating Mystery, Liezi the Perfected Person of Empty Vacuity, and Gengsangzi the Perfected Person of Cavernous Spirit. Their writings shall be retitled *True Scriptures*. The Academy of Mysterious Learning shall appoint one Erudite and one Instructor, with one hundred students.”

The Vice Director of the Chancellery, Chen Xilie, memorialized: “I have observed that in the gracious edict of the twentieth day of this month, Zhuangzi was titled the Perfected Person of Southern Florescence, and his work retitled *The True Scripture of Southern Florescence*. Its teachings all concern the essentials of nurturing life, elucidating profound mysteries with a hundred thousand words of mystery, tracing the origins of the Daoist scriptures and encompassing the five thousand subtle principles. Formerly, when I had the honor of attending the imperial lectures and expounding the true text on bended knee, upon reaching the seven chapters, Your Majesty remarked: ‘Among them is *The Mainstay of Nurturing Life*—I have already grasped the art of longevity. Next is *The Token of Full Virtue*—how could there be no extraordinary response?’ I kowtowed and replied: ‘Your Majesty’s virtue is full within, and your actions respond without. After your words were spoken, great blessings must follow, as in the later chapter titled *Responding to Emperors and Kings*.’ Now the Mysterious Origin Emperor has indeed manifested the sacred talisman, revealing the boundless fortune of the imperial lineage and embodying the Dao’s foreknowledge of future events. To honor him with titles and display his image is a ritual unheard of in ages past. I have long cherished this scripture, studying and reciting it for over thirty years, performing rites and burning incense to aid the sagely transformation. Having encountered this extraordinary blessing, my joy surpasses all ordinary sentiment. I humbly request that this be recorded by the historiographers to make manifest the numinous response.”

This was permitted.

In the third month, an imperial edict commanded the *Records of the Historian* to include the "Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages," wherein the Mysterious Origin Emperor was elevated to the rank of Supreme Sage. An edict further established one magistrate each for Zhenyuan County in Bozhou, the Temple of the Primordial Heavenly Empress, and the Temple of the Mysterious Origin Emperor.

On the *wuyin* day of the fourth month, an edict proclaimed: “That from which transformation arises is called the Dao; that by which the Dao operates is called virtue. Its meaning is most vast—who but a sage could elucidate it? In the final years of the Zhou, when the age and the Dao alike declined, our illustrious ancestor, the Mysterious Origin Emperor, revealed the wondrous root, drawing forth and guiding living beings. He thereupon composed the five thousand words of the *Mysterious Classic*, to remedy the ills of the age. Its significance surpasses the *Book of Images* and the *Striking the Drum*; its principles penetrate the subtlest mysteries. It is unmatched by any work of myriad generations, nor can the *Six Classics* compare. Yet those who inherit and practice the former tradition, deeming its scrolls few in number, have relegated it to the category of minor scriptures. Its profound words and abstruse purport are thus misnamed and misconstrued.

Henceforth, throughout the realm, apart from students of the *Exalted Mystery* who are to be examined as before, all other candidates tested on the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* shall cease. The authorities shall select another minor scripture in its stead. Let the *Classic of the Dao* be designated the Upper Scripture, and the *Classic of Virtue* the Lower Scripture, that the Dao may be honored and virtue esteemed, upheld and revered. Let all, near and far, know Our intent.”

Here ends Scroll Eight of the *Sacred Records of the Primordial Origin*.

In the ninth month, the Purple Ultimate Palace was established in Qiao Commandery. Following the precedent of the Western Capital, it was designated the Grand Clarity Palace. The temples of the Primordial Celestial August Emperor and the Primordial Celestial August Empress were likewise converted into palaces.

The system of the Grand Clarity Palace: three gates opened to the south in two rows, and three gates opened to the east and west in one row. Halberds were installed at each gate. The main hall had eight bays front and back, with steps at the *mao*, *wu*, and *you* positions, and a place for the distribution of meals. Dragon and sand terraces were laid out, along with chambers for the emperor’s fasting officials, the ducal ministers, the officiating officials, the imperial kitchens, the fasting kitchens, and the residences of the palace staff.

On the *wuxu* day of the twelfth month, the emperor visited the Huaqing Palace. Suddenly, the Lord Lao appeared above the Audience of the Primordial Pavilion, vanishing after the passage of a moment. Thereupon, the Audience of the Primordial Pavilion was renamed the Pavilion of the Descended Sage.

The emperor saw that the divine talisman bore the inscription “Celestial Treasure, Ten Thousand Years.” The characters “Celestial Treasure” had already presaged the change of the reign title. Thus, he issued an edict to alter the term “year” to “cycle” to accord with it. He also renamed Taolin County as Lingbao County, established the Celestial Treasure Abbey, and had the imperial composition *Inscription on the Divine Talisman* erected there.

In the fourth month of the fourth cycle, on the *guisi* day, an edict proclaimed: “To honor ancestors and serve the departed, reverence is essential; to distinguish rites and rectify ceremonies, propriety must follow the dictates of sentiment. We reflect that the Great Sage Ancestor, the August Emperor of the Primordial Mystery, ascended to heaven in a cloud of *qi*, attaining long life and enduring vision. His sacred form, profound and unfathomable, merges with the boundless transformations of the Mystery. His true countenance has repeatedly manifested, and celestial treasures have gathered in succession. In reverent awe of his blessings, which truly endure forever, We observe that in the rituals at the Grand Clarity Palace, all participants don the full ceremonial regalia. Yet when it comes to the presentation of music, the old names remain unchanged. Moreover, at the time of offerings, the invocation of the *jia* spirit is still recited—this is neither the proper rite for the living nor the fitting ceremony for the descent of immortals. Since the true countenance is peerless and the rites for the unseen differ from those for the manifest, there are reasons of principle that call for adaptation. Henceforth, in all rituals conducted at the Grand Clarity Palace and its affiliated palaces, officials shall don court robes instead, and the invocation tablets shall be discontinued. The words of the offerings and the music to be performed shall be composed by Us personally. The relevant authorities shall prepare the ritual protocols and submit them for Our review.”

The emperor composed the melodies *Descending Perfection* and *Summoning the Immortal*, as well as *Purple Tenuity* and *Escorting the Immortal*, to be performed at the Grand Clarity Palace. By edict, the “Three Bows” were changed to “Three Reverences,” and the invocation tablets were replaced with “blue petitions,” written in vermilion on azure paper. The emperor’s signature was to read, “The Hereditary Emperor, Your Subject So-and-So,” to be observed as the permanent standard.

In the intercalary sixth month of the seventh cycle, on the *bingyin* day, the emperor personally paid homage at the Grand Clarity Palace, bestowing upon the August Ancestor, the August Emperor of the Primordial Dao, the exalted title *August Ancestor, Great Dao, August Emperor of the Primordial Mystery*.

On the *bingchen* day, an edict declared: “The wondrous original texts of the Mysterious Ancestor contain subtle words indeed, transmitting models for learning and propagating the supreme transformation. For this reason, We dispatched envoys to seek the Dao, sending them far and wide to search and collect. In moments of respite from governance, We personally examined the texts. Having corrected errors and emended the volumes, We now ensure their elucidation to honor and encourage the Dao. Let all Daoist scriptures now issued from the palace be copied by the Academy of the Exalted Mystery and distributed to the Commissioners for the Collection of Scriptures in the various circuits, who shall in turn have them transcribed within their jurisdictions. The official copies shall remain with the commissioners, who shall personally encourage recitation in the prefectures.

No teaching of the sages precedes that of the Dao, and every school must have its master. Confucius and the Sage Ancestor flourished at the same time, both serving as the foremost teachers of their traditions. Though comparing their words and virtues defies easy description, the traces of Confucius inquiring about rites and receiving instruction are well attested. Reflecting on the meaning of ‘repeatedly’ and honoring the unity of the exalted, We decree that in the Palace of the Grand Tenuity, before the image of the Sage Ancestor, an additional likeness of Confucius shall be installed, standing with the Four Perfected Ones to his left and right.”

On that day, a general amnesty was declared. The edict read: “The rites of seasonal sacrifices maintain proper order, while changes in substance and form adapt to the times. Our dynasty traces its lineage to the immortal clan and inherits its legacy from the Sage Ancestor. With accumulating prosperity and repeated blessings, We have bestowed boundless favor. It is fitting to establish an enduring ritual for the shared veneration of the divine. Henceforth, at every seasonal sacrifice, the proper arrangement of positions shall be set before the Sage Ancestor in the Grand Clarity Palace. Above, this will clarify the rites of terrestrial pairing to reverently follow the Mysterious Ancestor; below, it will fully express the sincerity of devotion without transgressing the supreme Dao. In the past, seasonal sacrifices were sometimes suspended during the regular offerings, a practice that, while convenient, may have compromised the completeness of ritual. Hereafter, at every seasonal sacrifice, the regular offerings shall consist of plain food, and the triple presentation of incense shall replace the triple libation.”

When the Grand Clarity Palace was first completed, artisans were dispatched to Mount Taibai to quarry white stone for the sacred image of the August Primordial. They also carved an image of the August Ancestor, which was placed to the right, both clad in the robes and crowns of state, adorned with silk and vermilion jade. Later, a jade sculpture of the Lord Lao and the August Ancestor, along with the emperor’s true countenance, was installed in the Palace of the Inaugurated Sage.

On the *gengyin* day of the ninth cycle, the Censor-in-Chief Wang Boye reported that Wang Xuan’yi of Mount Taibai had beheld the August Emperor of the Primordial Mystery within the Treasure Immortal Grotto. He presented a stone casket containing the *Scripture of Supplication for the Protection of the State*, a treasure tally, and other records. The emperor ordered the Minister of Justice, Wang Chui, to retrieve them, and they were subsequently presented to the throne.

On the first day of the first month of the tenth cycle, the *yiyou* day, the emperor personally offered sacrifices at the Grand Clarity Palace. On the *guisi* day, he performed the ancestral rites at the Grand Temple, and on the *jiawu* day, he conducted the sacrifices to heaven and earth at the southern suburban altar.

In the eleventh cycle, the *renchen* year, famine struck the Three Mountains, killing fifteen or sixteen out of every ten. Many survived by eating wild kudzu and mountain yams. Suddenly, two azure lads descended into the courtyard of the female Daoist Wang Fajin of Jian Prefecture. They declared: “The Great Emperor, recognizing your innate immortal bones and your unwavering devotion to the Dao, has commanded us to escort you to the Upper Capital to receive your duties.”

Wang Fajin unconsciously rose into the void, ascending directly to the imperial presence. Now, when the Venerable Lord governs the Ten Heavens and oversees the myriad people, he is called the Heavenly August Great Emperor Radiant-Soul Treasure. Thereupon, Wang Fajin prostrated in audience. The Venerable Lord offered her a draught of rosy nectar and gently addressed her: “When the people of the world spurn the five grains, they incur the censure of the celestial spirits. You must return to the world and admonish the common folk, urging them to repent of their transgressions.” He then commanded his attendant maidens to present her with a scroll of *The Numinous Treasure Rites of Purificatory Fasting and Thanksgiving to Heaven and Earth*, to be transmitted throughout the world. He declared: “Let them gather in secluded places upon lofty mountains to perform fasts and repent of their sins, and their past karmic burdens shall be dissolved. The spirits of the grain father and silkworm mother will then bestow abundance.” “In the year of the Dragon and Tiger, I shall summon you again.” With that, he sent her back. The present *Heavenly Lord’s Fast* observed in Shu is this very rite.

In the twelfth cycle, Wang Fajin once more ascended to heaven. In the thirteenth cycle, on the *guiyou* day of the second month, the emperor personally offered sacrifices at the Grand Clarity Palace and bestowed upon the Sacred Ancestor, the Mysterious Origin Emperor, the august title *Great Sacred Ancestor, Supreme Great Dao, Golden Watchtower, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Great Emperor*. He decreed that the officials should henceforth perform the rites of offering and incense-burning on the four seasonal beginnings and the five *la* festivals, and that all prefectures and counties under heaven should perpetually follow this model.

In the fifteenth cycle, the emperor toured Shu. The Mysterious Origin [Lord] appeared by the Blackwater River in Sanquan County of Hanzhong Prefecture, and the emperor personally paid reverence. He then commanded that a stone likeness of the true countenance be carved at the site, six *li* south of Qinwang Post Station. Later, in Yichang County of Lizhou, atop a mountain ridge, the Venerable Lord was seen riding a white deer. Suddenly, the deer shed its antlers, transforming into a white stag, thereby foretelling the suppression of [An] Lushan’s rebellion. By imperial edict, the mountain was named White Guard Ridge, and a *Ziran* Abbey was established at the site of the apparition.

In his youth, Li Bi harbored aspirations for immortality and once journeyed to Mount Song to seek Daoist arts. The Venerable Lord instructed Anqi Sheng to admonish him, saying: “The dynastic fortune is imperiled, and the times are fraught with calamity. You should aid the sovereign with civil and martial arts, broadly succoring the living, and only then may you cast off the mortal coil and ascend in transcendence.” Li Bi thereupon returned and assisted Emperor Suzong in quelling the rebellion and restoring the royal house. He served three reigns in succession before transforming into an immortal.

According to the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era*: Li Bi’s mother, née Zhou, carried him in her womb for three years before giving birth, and he was born with hair down to his brows. As a child, he was so light that he could stand atop a screen. A Daoist remarked: “This boy will ascend to heaven in broad daylight at the age of fifteen.” Strange fragrances and celestial music would sometimes arise, and colored clouds would hang upon the trees in his courtyard. His family then prepared garlic and ginger, commanding someone to climb onto the roof and scatter them.

Later, while traveling to Mount Song and Mount Heng, he encountered Master Tongxiang, Master Xianmen, and Master Anqi, who taught him the arts of longevity, feathered transcendence, and alchemical ingestion. They admonished him: “By the command of the Supreme, the dynastic fortune is in peril, and the court faces many trials. You should aid the sovereign with civil and martial arts, ensuring your merit extends to the living, and only then may you ascend in transcendence and cast off the mortal coil.” Thereafter, he often abstained from grains and ingested *qi*, cultivating the essentials of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s *Valley Spirit*.

In the eighth year of the Tianbao era, while staying at the home of his cousin Zheng Shuze, Li Bi suddenly fell into a deep slumber. His body then emerged from the crown of his head, two or three *cun* in length, with attendant immortals waving their hands and moving their eyes as if assisting. When his feet nearly reached the top of his head, he thought: “The great task is not yet complete, and I still cherish my family.” He then willed himself to return, and those beside him dispersed. He saw a figure of immense stature, clad in imperial robes, before whom a woman in ceremonial dress knelt. The imperial figure reproached him: “Though I knew you were not yet ready, I still summoned you, troubling the host of divine immortals.” The kneeling woman replied: “Not so. It would be better to instruct him to draw near the Son of Heaven.” He then awoke.

In the tenth year, Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to court, where he composed *The August Tang Dynastic Fortune* and lectured on the *Daodejing*. The emperor decreed that he should be as a commoner among the crown prince and the princes. Yang Guozhong, envious of him, banished him to the famous mountains. When An Lushan seized Tong Pass, Emperors Xuanzong and Suzong divided their routes to tour the realm, and Prince Wang was appointed military commissioner of the He-Luo region. Someone found Li Bi between Mount Song and Mount Shaoshi, and upon receiving a handwritten letter from Emperor Suzong, Prince Wang immediately provided carriages and horses to send him to Lingwu. Emperor Suzong received him both within and without the palace, consulting him on all matters, great and small. They slept on adjacent couches and rode side by side when traveling.

Once, while discussing the merits and rewards of the generals, Li Bi remarked: “If I may speak of my own wishes, they differ from those of others.” The emperor asked: “How so?” Li Bi replied: “I abstain from grains and have no family. Rank and fief are of no concern to me. I only wish to sleep with my head upon the emperor’s knee, so that the officials may report that a guest star has trespassed upon the imperial seat.” The emperor laughed heartily.

During the southern sojourn to Fufeng, at each halt, the emperor would order Li Bi to lead the marshal’s troops ahead, inspect the lodgings, secure the keys, and submit reports before the imperial carriage arrived at Baoding Prefecture. Li Bi, somewhat fatigued, dozed off in his quarters. When the emperor arrived, he did not disturb him but instead climbed onto the bed and cradled Li Bi’s head in his lap. After a long while, Li Bi awoke, and the emperor said: “You have now rested upon the Son of Heaven’s knee. When shall the recovery of the realm be achieved?” Li Bi hastily rose and apologized: “In my estimation, by the numinous power of the Nine Ancestral Temples and the might of Your Majesty, it shall be as the name of this prefecture suggests—soon to be pacified and stabilized.” Within ten days, the armies of the Western Regions, Hexi, and Jiang-Huai, along with the corvée laborers, arrived in succession, and the two capitals were recovered.

When Li Bi dwelled in the mountains, he dwelt in secluded forests, aloof from worldly affairs. When he served at court, his secret strategies and upright counsel always accorded with the mysterious workings of the Dao. Thus, across four reigns, his favor and distinction were unparalleled. Yet such men as Yuan Zai and Li Fuguo regarded him as an enemy.

When Emperor Daizong ascended the throne, he repeatedly bestowed gifts upon Li Bi. Imperial messengers crowded the roads, proclaiming him "Master of the Central Peak at Tianzhu Peak." He was granted the *Chaotian Jade Tablet* and, upon his passing, posthumously honored as Grand Mentor to the Crown Prince. That same month, the imperial messenger Lin Yuan encountered Li Bi at an inn near Blue Pass—riding alone in plain clothes, briefly bound for Mount Hua. They spoke of affairs across three reigns, their sorrow lingering long before parting. Upon reaching Chang’an, Lin Yuan learned of his death. When Emperor Dezong heard the news, his grief was profound.

Thus was fulfilled the saying that Li Bi had aided four sagely rulers and escaped calamity. The Daoist Wang Faming of Kuizhou was born with an abnormally long tongue, rendering his speech unclear. After entering the Dao, he recited the *Daodejing* daily. Years later, he suddenly dreamed of Lord Lao trimming his tongue. Upon waking, his speech was corrected.

On the eighteenth day of the third month in the ding-you year of the Zhide era (757 CE), the people of Tonghua Commandery gathered at Cloud Dragon Crag to pray for the nation’s fortune, holding a grand fast. Suddenly, auspicious clouds and strange fragrances arose, lingering without dissipating. After some time, they gradually parted, revealing divine radiance illuminating the sky. There stood Lord Lao before the mountain, his form bridging earth and heaven. Though the mountain was tall, it reached no higher than his elbow. His left hand hung down, while his right held a *Fivefold Luminous Fan*, his majestic presence resplendent.

The assembled multitude gazed in reverence, and after a long while, he vanished. A full report was promptly submitted, and an imperial decree ordered the event depicted in paintings.

The Supreme August High Emperor composed a eulogy with preface, saying: "Our Great Sage Ancestor, born to unfold the manifold mysteries, illumined the Upper Clarity, bequeathing wisdom to his descendants and repeatedly manifesting subtle aid. By day, he appeared in wondrous form, auspicious hues floating in the void. Clad in raiment of the Seven Luminaries and Fivefold Brilliance, attended by jade lads and golden maidens, he drew homage from Daoists, Buddhists, humans, and devas alike. In former times, the *Zhen’gao* was transmitted at Yangjiao, ensuring the imperial line’s boundless endurance; today, his august presence shines upon Dragon Crag, and inauspicious vapors shall soon vanish. Not merely has this been a transmission across generations, whereby former kings attained the One—it is also a sign of blessings bestowed upon the ancestral temple and state, ensuring ten thousand generations. We command that this be rendered in elegant brushwork and displayed throughout the commanderies and kingdoms. Beholding it beneath the vast heavens shall be as standing in the Hall of the Supreme Ultimate."

Eulogy:
"August was our illustrious ancestor,
Who expounded the teaching in due time.
Governing body and state alike,
He declared: ‘Seek the sunlit level plain.’
Above, he opened the grottoes of immortals;
Below, he beheld the divine countenance.
Radiant was the perfect Dao,
Its counsel ever non-action.
The cliffs and valleys grew resplendent,
Beyond the reach of cinnabar and ink.
Divine light flickered,
Auspicious daylight lingered.
The court rejoiced,
All commanderies came to witness.
Blessings and prosperity flowed forth,
A thousand ages dwelling here."

In the second year of the Qianyuan era (759 CE), on a *jihai* day, the Emperor dreamed of two azure lads leading him to a palace, where he was granted an audience with Lord Lao. Crowned with a Nine-Phoenix Diadem and robed in cloud-and-rosy-gauze attire, his beard and hair were black. Leaning upon a jade armrest and holding a whisk, he was attended by a vast retinue of perfected ones, lads, jade maidens, and divine warriors. The Emperor, clad in crimson robes and holding a ritual tablet, stood in attendance behind him. They traversed mountains and seas, journeying great distances. At dawn, he summoned images for comparison and found that in the Hall of the Sage Ancestor at the Guangtian Abbey in Wuguang Ward, there indeed stood a statue of Lord Lao with black hair, exactly as seen in the dream. Overjoyed, the Emperor had his own imperial portrait painted and placed standing behind the statue. He then issued an edict commanding its veneration throughout the realm.

On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the fifth year of the Dali era (770 CE), Emperor Daizong turned to his ministers and asked: "Is the matter of divine immortals credible?" Li Fan replied: "The notion of divine immortals originates with the Daoists, whose teachings are founded upon the *Laozi*’s five thousand words. The *Laozi*’s essential message differs not from the classics. Later generations, fond of the strange, falsely attributed tales of divine immortals to Laozi. Thus did the First Emperor of Qin dispatch alchemists to sea in search of masters, only to be deluded and gain nothing. Emperor Wen consumed a foreign monk’s elixir and succumbed to a sudden, incurable illness. As the ancient poem says: ‘Those who take elixirs seeking immortality / Are often undone by the drugs.’ How true these words are! For rulers, the sole duty is to govern with principle. When the Four Seas rejoice in their leadership and the altars of soil and grain endure, longevity comes naturally." The Emperor deeply assented.

On the sixteenth day of the tenth month in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era (794 CE), the female Daoist Xie Ziran of Golden Spring Mountain in Nanchong County, Guozhou, having perfected her Daoist practice, was summoned by Lord Lao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Three months later, she descended from heaven once more and said to Prefect Li Jian: "In heaven stands the loftiest Jade Hall, where Lord Lao resides. Its walls are of white jade, inscribed above with the names of divine immortals in gold. At times, vermilion script appears beneath, noting those destined to descend as emperors or chief ministers. Whenever divine immortals enter to pay homage to Lord Lao, all bow four times. Fearing that the world would not believe in the existence of divine immortals, I have come briefly to tell you this." Having spoken, she ascended to heaven. Li Jian reported the matter in a memorial, and an imperial edict was issued in praise.

According to the *Taiping Guangji*, Xie Ziran was of exceptional intelligence from a young age and abstained from meat and blood. Her mother sent her to study under the nun Yue Hui for a year, but she fell ill and sought to return home. Later, she was sent again to study under the nun Ri Xiao for several months, but once more asked to go back. Her family lived at the foot of Da Fang Mountain, whose summit bore a stone statue of Lord Lao. Gazing upon it, Ziran turned to her mother and said, "This is where I wish to dwell." Her mother consented, and they moved to the mountaintop, where she constantly recited the *Daode Jing* and the *Huangting Neipian*.

After some time, at the age of fourteen, she ate newly harvested rice and saw it was infested with maggots. From that moment, she ceased taking grain. Her father, Xie Huan, had been away on official duties for many years. Upon returning and seeing that Ziran no longer ate, he grew furious: "Our family has long followed the Confucian way—how could such demonic delusion take hold?" He locked her in a room for over forty days, yet she only grew more radiant and refined. Huan was then struck with astonishment.

Later, the Lady of Mount Tai and various immortals frequently descended to her home, instructing her to bathe in fragrant water but forbidding the use of *rutou* incense. They also said: "Heaven has its true immortals, not the likes of ghosts or spirits. In the celestial realms, none shave their heads; after attaining the Dao, all don immortal robes and cap shoes." When Ziran ascended to heaven, she wrote on the eastern wall of the hall: "I leave this message for my kin: do not grieve. Diligently cultivate merit, establish fields of blessings, purify your fasts, and recite the Dao. After a hundred kalpas, may you have good cause to meet again in the Pure Source homeland." Her writing remained there.

Li Jian’s *Stele of the Jinquan Daoist Sanctuary* and its accompanying biography fully record these events. Han Yu, the Duke of Changli, wrote a poem on the matter:

In Nanchong County, Guozhou,
A girl named Xie Ziran, chilled by fate,
Knew nothing of the world’s ways,
Only heard of divine immortals.
Light of life, she followed their path,
Dwelling on Jinquan Mountain.
She spurned all worldly glory,
Abandoning her parents’ tender love.
One day, seated in an empty chamber,
Mists arose around her.
As if hearing the strains of sheng and pipes,
From the boundless heavens they came.
Daylight turned to twilight’s gloom,
A chill wind swept the scene.
Eaves and pillars flickered in light,
Five-colored radiance linked in chains.
Onlookers stood in awe,
Hesitant to draw near.
In an instant, she rose lightly,
Drifting like smoke in the wind.
Vast the eight directions stretch,
No trace to follow.
The village elder reported the event,
The prefect, startled, came to see.
He drove his carriage with officials,
Outpacing the curious crowd.
Entering the house, they found nothing—
Only robes and shoes, shed like a cicada’s shell.
All declared it the work of immortals,
A tale truly worthy of transmission.
This is the story it tells.

In the first year of Baoli of Emperor Jingzong, *yisi* (7th month, 7th year of the sexagenary cycle), the Left Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat and Grand Councilor Li Fengji was appointed as Acting Grand Commandant to preside over the autumn offering to the Great Sage Ancestor at the Taiqing Palace. In the second year of Baoli, *bingwu* (1st month, 14th year of the cycle), the Emperor conducted rites at the Southern Suburban Altar and paid homage at the Taiqing Palace. As the imperial procession approached, the Lord Lao manifested as an elderly man in white robes, pointing to Zheng Wen, the Chief Clerk of Chang’an County, and saying: "There is a common well along this path—fill it at once." Soon after, the old man vanished. When the imperial carriage arrived, the matter was reported, and the assembled officials offered their congratulations. An edict was issued to the Vice Minister of War, Wei Chumou, to compose an inscription, and to the Gentleman for Court Audiences, Liu Gongquan, to inscribe it. The stele was erected beside the filled well, and the account was recorded by the official historians.

As the stele was being raised, a sudden gust of wind arose, swirling around the platform without cease. Gazing upward, the crowd beheld the Lord Lao clad in a purple robe and golden crown, his feet shod in golden slippers, standing upon a white lotus. In his right hand he held a Fivefold Radiance Fan, while his left hung down, and a golden light shone in the air around him. Liu Gongquan and the stonecutters gazed upon him for a long while, then traced his likeness upon the ground. As the drawing neared completion, the Lord Lao suddenly pointed his fan toward the sky, scattering streams of light in all directions before ascending into the void. All eyes followed him until, in an instant, he grew distant and vanished into the clouds. The event was reported to the throne, and an edict ordered the account to be inscribed upon the stele. The stele, inscribed by Liu Gongquan and composed by Wei Chumou, remains extant.

In the eighth month of the seventh year of Taihe, *guichou* (40th year of the cycle), Emperor Wenzong issued a decree: "The Sage establishes the ultimate, and the foundation of teaching lies in honoring the ancestors. The king aligns with Heaven, and in duty he reveres his forebears. Our Great Sage Ancestor, the Mysterious Origin Emperor, inaugurated the treasure of fortune and bestowed his blessings upon the Tang, bringing the Six Directions to great harmony and guiding all beings to the realm of longevity. In preserving this grand enterprise, we rely upon the legacy of his wisdom. We have heard that the Taiqing Palace in Bozhou has repeatedly suffered from floods, its structures appearing dilapidated. As this is the sacred birthplace of the Sage, how could we neglect our reverence? Let Li Cheng, Military Commissioner of the Xuanwu Army, concurrently serve as Commissioner of the Bozhou Taiqing Palace, and charge him with its gradual restoration, that due homage may be paid in season, fulfilling Our intent."

In the second year of Kaicheng, *dingsi* (54th year of the cycle, 5th month), the Drafter of Imperial Edicts Gao Yuanyu, serving as Prefect of Bazhou, suddenly noticed an unusual radiance upon a cliff face north of the city, nine *li* from the banks of the Jialing River. Drawing nearer, he saw upon the stone a naturally formed image of the Lord Lao, his brows, hair, headscarf, slippers, and robes all perfectly rendered. Beside him stood a figure in loose robes and wide sleeves, holding a censer to offer incense. Behind them, a young attendant with twin topknots stood in solemn attendance, as if awaiting commands.

All these were beyond what human craftsmanship—whether painting, drawing, or carving—could achieve. Whenever Gao Yuanyu made prayers, purple-black vapors would rise from the stone, and a sacred spring would well forth of its own accord. When local officials and commoners sought blessings, none failed to receive immediate efficacy. Thereupon, he had the site carved into stone and a hall erected to mark this auspicious sign. He also commissioned an illustrated report to be submitted to the throne, and by imperial decree, the event was recorded in the official histories.

In the first month of the *gengshen* year (57th year of the cycle), the fifth year of Kaicheng, Emperor Wuzong ascended the throne. In the second month, he issued an edict designating the birthday of the August Emperor of the Mysterious Origin as the "Descended Sage Festival," granting a three-day holiday.

On the first day of the seventh month in the fourth year of Dazhong under Emperor Xuanzong, the Lord Lao dispatched the Perfected One Han Zhong to bestow upon the Daoist Hou Daohua of the Daojing Cloister in Yongle County, Hezhong, the surname Li and the name Neizhi, commanding him to reside in the Shan Jin Cloister of the Supreme Clarity Palace.

According to the *Shi Zhi*: During the reign of Emperor Wenzong of Tang, the Daoist Deng Taixuan completed his elixir and left a sealed container hidden within the cloister. Later, Zhou Wuxian took charge of the cloister, where there was a certain Hou Daohua who served as a menial—sweeping, cleaning, and performing every lowly task—treated by the other Daoists as little more than a slave. Yet he was always fond of histories and philosophical works, never setting down his books. When others mocked him, he would reply: "There are no dull-witted immortals in heaven."

One day, he trimmed the branches of the ancient pine before the gate, saying, "These will hinder my ascension one day." The others were all enraged. This occurred on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the fifth year of Dazhong.

The next morning, Daohua left a poem for Zhou Wuxian, which read:
*"Within the wrapper, the Great Return Elixir lay,
For years its hue unchanged—yet last night stolen away.
Today, with hexagrams empty, I take flight and rise.
Ashamed, I bid you treasure well, treasure well the Heavenly Master Deng.
When in years to come you refine the medicine true,
Leave some for Neizhi—let it not be lost from view.
If my master knows this decree,
Hasten the alchemy, delay not thee.
The Three Clarities await me alone,
The Great Canopy’s destined throne."*

Below, in smaller script, he added:
*"On the first day of the seventh month last year, I received the honor of Perfected Han’s descent, who bestowed upon me the surname Li and the name Neizhi, assigning me to reside in the Shan Jin Cloister of the Supreme Clarity Palace. Now, beneath the ancient pine, I cast off my sandals, ascend beyond its boughs, remove my robes and hang them upon the pine, then ascend in flight."*

Governor Zheng Guang investigated and verified the account, reporting the matter to the throne. An imperial edict granted five hundred bolts of silk and a set of imperial robes, ordering the renovation of the halls and corridors, and bestowing the name "Ascension to Immortality Cloister."

In the second year of Dazhong, the year *wuyin*, the Tiantai Mountain monk Chen Huixu had long resided at Guoqing Monastery. One day, while wandering the mountains with fellow monks, they wished to cross the stone bridge, but the rushing waters and slippery moss made the others tremble and hesitate. Huixu alone leapt across with ease, scaling the stone cliff, and did not return by evening.

Huixu, having reached the far side of the cliff, saw a faint path that gradually widened into a level expanse. Before him stood palaces and pavilions, ten *li* in length, adorned with myriad flowers. Three gates stood facing one another like a tripod; the central gate bore the inscription *Hall of Meeting Perfected Ones*, the left *Palace of the Golden Court*, and the right *Palace of the Paulownia Terrace*. All were adorned with golden eaves and jade windows, towering over a hundred *zhang* in height.

Entering the western side of the right gate, he saw another grand tower with a wide entrance, inscribed *Palace of the Right Assistant*. It comprised thousands of interconnected chambers, their jade steps and marble terraces winding in graceful curves, with flowing channels of water coursing through. Everywhere was splendid adornment, yet no trace of human presence.

Proceeding into another courtyard, he saw five or six youths in black robes glancing at one another, laughing as they departed. When he repeatedly questioned them, they replied, "Ask Elder Zhang." Soon after, an old man appeared, leaning on a staff and holding flowers. Startled, he said, "How did a mortal like you come here?"

Huixu replied, "I have often heard that beyond the stone bridge lies the Arhat Temple, and the sound of its bells reaches the mortal world. Thus, I came seeking it. By what fortune have I arrived at this realm? I do not know where the arhats reside."

Elder Zhang said, "This is the blessed court of the true immortals, the lower palace beneath the Heavenly Emperor, called the Golden Court. It is the land of immortality, the numinous realm where the true are nurtured, spanning one hundred and sixty *li* in circumference. The Perfected King of the Right Assistant and the Paulownia Terrace governs it, with three thousand immortals in ranks, three hundred perfected ones, and ten thousand divine kings, warriors, heavenly emperors, and jade maidens—forming a lesser celestial assembly. The Most High Lord Lao descends here thrice a year to assess the merits and ranks of those who cultivate the Dao throughout the world. This is the capital of the immortals, not the abode of arhats."

Huixu asked, "Who is the Perfected King?"

Elder Zhang replied, "He is the crown prince of King Ling of Zhou, disciple of Fu Qiu Gong, and holds the rank of Perfected One."

Huixu asked, "Can one learn to become an immortal?"

Elder Zhang said, "Through accumulating merit and virtue, one may ascend to heaven in the flesh. It depends on steadfast resolve and enduring effort. That you have glimpsed this blessed court suggests you may yet have hope of learning the Way."

Huixu asked again, "By what path does one enter the immortal’s Dao?"

Elder Zhang replied, "Internally, preserve the spirit and refine the *qi*; externally, ingest the elixirs of cinnabar. All who become immortals do so through the power of divine elixirs. You cannot stay long—the Perfected One has just journeyed to the Eastern Sea, and if his mounted retinue returns, you may face unseen consequences."

He then led Huixu out. After ten paces, Huixu found himself back at Guoqing Monastery.

From that time onward, Huixu grew ever more devoted to the Dao, developing a fondness for alchemical minerals. In his later years, he took residence at Sun-Embracing Monastery on Mount Zhongnan, where, though his body gradually weakened with age, his heart burned all the more fervently. After lying ill for over a month, utterly emaciated and frail, an old man suddenly arrived at the temple bearing a medicine satchel, crying aloud, "I sell the Great Return Elixir!" The monks all laughed at him, then pointed to Huixu’s door and jestingly said to the old man, "This monk is rather fond of the Return Elixir—you might well sell it to him." The old man gladly approached, leaving behind several pills. Huixu promptly consumed them. The old man departed at once, and the monks gathered to ask what had happened. Huixu replied that he had bought and swallowed the Return Elixir, then gestured toward them from afar, saying, "Do not come near—I sense a foul odor about you all." Soon after, he changed into fresh robes, then suddenly flew up to the eaves of the hall. Waving farewell, he rose gently into the air and departed.

In the second month of the gengchen year of the Xiantong era of Emperor Yizong (860 CE), the rebel Chou Fu, leading a band of outlaws, raided and plundered Yuezhou, rampaging through its counties. Officials fled in terror as he seized the city of Kuaiji. An imperial edict ordered the assembly of troops from eight circuits to suppress the rebellion, and the populace scattered in panic. There was a man named Shen Ying whose family revered the image of Lord Lao with utmost sincerity. When Ying heard that the rebels were approaching, he hastily locked his door and fled, accidentally leaving a young servant boy inside. Upon returning to unlock the door, he found the area overrun with enemy encampments. Later, as the tide of battle shifted unpredictably, the marketplace was set ablaze. After nearly a year and more, the rebellion was finally quelled. Yet when Ying returned to his home, he found it entirely unscathed. Upon unlocking the door, he discovered the boy unharmed. Asked what had happened, the boy replied that after the door was locked, he had felt no fear at all. A youth in green robes, about thirteen or fourteen years old, had appeared and said, "Lord Lao has sent me to play with you." He then led the boy to a grand residence, where he was given food and fruit. After eating for what seemed like half a day, he heard Lord Lao command him to tend the incense. No sooner had he lit the incense at the stove than he heard the sound of the door. When Ying entered, the incense was still burning.

In the ninth month of the jichou year (869 CE), the rebel Pang Xun of Xuzhou advanced on Bozhou with over three thousand followers, intending to seize the Great Clarity Palace as a stronghold. On that day, over a thousand refugees—scholars and commoners—had taken shelter within the palace. Suddenly, they saw Lord Lao ascend into the sky from the palace grounds, moving southward. Moments later, a black vapor rose from the Nine Wells, and soon the entire valley was shrouded in darkness. The rebels lost their way and trampled one another in confusion, and Pang Xun drowned in the waters. When the border patrol arrived, the sky cleared, and not a single rebel remained. Li Wei, the military governor of Bianzhou, reported the event to the throne. An emissary was dispatched to the palace to offer thanks, and an imperial edict was issued, reading:

*"The ancient village of Ku County, the sacred homeland of our August Ancestor, is adorned with majestic palaces and revered temples. Recently, as remnants of rebellion surged forth, setting fires and spreading destruction, dark mists veiled the clear sky, and the frenzied bandits lost their way upon the roads, scattering like deer in the wild—until all was laid waste. In profound awe of this mysterious power and the manifest efficacy of the divine, We now issue this decree in blue-green script to offer solemn thanks. Let it be proclaimed throughout the realm and recorded by the historians."*

In the third month of the gengzi year of the Guangming era of Emperor Xizong (880 CE), Huang Chao ravaged the commanderies and counties. In the seventh month, his forces advanced into Huainan, intending to burn the Great Clarity Palace. Suddenly, a cold wind arose from all directions, turning the heat to chill, and the rebels scattered in terror, ultimately retreating without daring to attack. Later, another band of outlaws sought to plunder the palace. As they neared its precincts, dark clouds gathered, obscuring their path. They turned back toward the city of Bozhou and laid siege to it, pressing the attack fiercely. The prefect, Pan Chou, faced the palace, burned incense, and bowed in prayer, beseeching divine protection. Soon, a black mist emerged from the palace and swirled around the city walls, reeking of a foul and terrifying stench. Then, a dense snow began to fall, bringing an unnatural cold. Over half the rebels perished, while within the city, the sky remained clear and serene. Divine crows swooped down to strike them, and in fear, the rebels lifted the siege and departed, soon scattering and perishing entirely.

Pan Chou ordered the Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Qiwu to submit a memorial, stating: "Since the jisi year of the Qianfu era, the Great Clarity Palace has repeatedly faced rebellious bandits, numbering from over a thousand to more than ten thousand. All have eyed the palace, seeking to burn and plunder it, or to attack the city, or to raid the surrounding counties—amounting to one hundred and eight incursions. Each time, Lord Lao has secretly manifested his divine transformations: suddenly raising thick clouds, or striking with wind and storm, or smiting with thunder and lightning. Without fail, the rebels were thrown into chaos and swiftly met their doom. The number of people thus shielded and protected is beyond reckoning. We humbly request that the county seat be relocated to the palace grounds."

The imperial reply stated: "We fear that relocating the county to the palace would bring much defilement. The county shall remain in its original location, but in accordance with the precedent of Wannian, it shall be elevated to the rank of a 'red county.' A formal memorial of thanks shall be presented." The emperor then bowed toward the palace and sent the emissary on his way.

On the twelfth day of the eighth month, an imperial edict proclaimed: "The Great Clarity Palace in Bozhou is the sacred site where the Primordial One descended, its name exalted among the Daoist patriarchs. Its blessings have nurtured the imperial foundation, its Nine-Dragon Auspicious Well brimming with celestial qi, and the immortal trace of the single deer lingering in the trees. The propitious omens of successive dynasties are worthy of record, and in recent years, its numinous responses have grown ever more manifest. How fitting that such a hallowed sanctuary should be reverently adorned—how could it be left to decay in a contentious world?

Magistrate Pan Zhou has long governed with virtuous policies, steeped in the true wind of the Dao. He has generously donated his official salary to restore the palace and its temples, ensuring that every wall, beam, and locust tree is meticulously renewed, while the painted statues and murals gleam with even greater splendor. Upon reviewing the plans and examining the work, We find it deeply gratifying.

The resident ceremonial Daoist Wu Chongxuan shall be granted the purple robe and styled 'Master of Congealed Mystery.' Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Qiwu shall likewise be granted the purple robe. Pan Zhou shall be promoted to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, with the concurrent title of Minister of Works. All other matters shall remain unchanged."

In the eleventh month, Huang Chao seized the eastern capital. The imperial carriage fled to Xingyuan. Jia Xiang, an official in the Bureau of Finance, possessed a portrait of Lord Lao, which he always carried with him. Wherever he stayed—even for a single day—he would set up an incense altar. When Huang Chao overran Chang’an, Xiang fled with his family to take refuge at the foot of Dragon Horn Mountain. Suddenly, a band of rebels surrounded his home. Xiang entered to pray before the portrait of Lord Lao, then emerged to speak with the rebels. They cast their blades to the ground and prostrated themselves before him. When Xiang reentered his home, the rebels remained kneeling outside, confessing their transgressions. Moved by pity, Xiang presented them with silk and offered words of comfort. They took nothing and departed.

When asked what they had seen to make them bow in reverence, they replied: "We saw that Lord Jia was surrounded by divine soldiers, each several *zhang* tall, their mouths agape and eyes bulging as if ready to devour us. We feared for our lives." Thereafter, no one dared disturb his household, and his gates remained unbarred.

In Chengdu, Yang Nao’er diligently worshipped Lord Lao without fail. Once, while defending Jintang Pass, he was captured and taken to a bandit stronghold in the southern mountains. Day and night, he prayed to Lord Lao, longing to see his parents again. Suddenly, he dreamed that Lord Lao bestowed upon him a cloud, and a youth led him away, depositing him on level ground. When he awoke, he had already escaped the mountain stronghold and made his way home. On the day of his return, his parents were holding a hundred-day memorial feast.

In the third month of the second year of the *Xin Chou* era, Wang Chongrong, Military Commissioner of Hezhong, memorialized: "According to a report from Jinzhou, on the side of the Hall of Lord Lao at the Blessing Tang Abbey on Dragon Horn Mountain, a wisteria vine had withered and regrown upon a parasol tree. This was the same tree where Lord Lao manifested during the *Wude* era, and later, a hall was built between two such trees. Over a year later, a wisteria vine spontaneously grew upon the tree, extending over ten *zhang* with extraordinary luxuriance. When the Prince of Qi usurped the succession, the vine withered and died. Ten days later, it revived, and soon after, the Prince of Qi was defeated. When Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne and Zhu Ci plotted rebellion, the vine withered again, only to regrow after a time. In the first year of the *Guangming* era, when Huang Chao threatened the capital, the vine withered that autumn. By the second year, its branches and leaves flourished anew. Moreover, another vine sprouted on a neighboring tree, growing over five *zhang* in ten days, its foliage exceptionally lush."

An edict was issued in praise, and the event was recorded by the court historians.

In the sixth month, the imperial carriage arrived in Chengdu. In the seventh month, the era name was changed to *Zhonghe*.

On the night of the sixteenth day of the seventh month in the second year of *Zhonghe* (*Ren Yin*), a crimson-black phenomenon like a rainbow stretched across the northwestern sky. The rebel general Shang Hu attacked Zizhou in Yijun, where snow fell a foot deep. The cold was extreme, and two or three out of every ten rebel soldiers froze to death.

On the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month (*Wuchen*), the imperial clansman Li Teli commanded Daoist Li Wuwei to perform a jiao ritual at the Mystic Center Abbey in the Green Ram Market of Chengdu. Suddenly, a red light like a sphere emerged from the bamboo grove southeast of the temple foundation, leaping and bounding until it vanished beneath a plum tree to the west. They dug at the spot and, after three *chi*, unearthed a bronze plaque. It measured one *chi*, one *cun*, and five *fen* in length; seven *cun* and four *fen* in width; one *cun* and three *fen* in thickness on one side, with floral patterns; and one *cun* and eight *fen* on the other, weighing twelve *jin*. Six ancient seal-script characters, each two *cun* square and three *fen* deep, were inscribed upon it, their carving so lustrous it seemed not of human craft. The inscription read: *The Supreme One pacifies the calamities of Zhonghe.*

On the fifteenth day of the ninth month (*Gengchen*), Chen Jingxuan, Military Commissioner of Xichuan and Grand Preceptor, memorialized: "Your Imperial Majesty reveres antiquity and aligns with Heaven, responding to the celestial mandate and nurturing the realm. Your heart is fixed upon the supreme Dao, and your ministers are in perfect harmony. Thus, You have journeyed to inspect the land, openly acknowledging faults. Your profound benevolence extends to the earth below, and Your supreme virtue ascends to the celestial realm above. Auspicious portents have appeared in abundance, and omens of blessing have manifested repeatedly. The Supreme One has bestowed upon Your servant the mandate to quell the calamities of *Zhonghe* and the scourge of rebels, revealing this divine inscription in ancient seal script. It is sufficient to show that the inauspicious vapors will soon vanish, that Your sagely longevity is boundless, and that the day of restoration and tranquility is at hand."

The emperor ordered the plaque to be shown to all officials.

The Vice Director of the Chancellery and concurrent Grand Councilor Zhang Zhaodu, the Vice Minister of Revenue and concurrent Grand Councilor Xiao Ran, the Vice Director of the Secretariat and concurrent Grand Councilor Zheng Tian, the Censor-in-Chief Zhang Xi, and the Duke of Cao, Prince Gui of the Imperial Clan, jointly submitted a memorial of congratulation: "We humbly observe that when rebels gather like howling jackals and the imperial carriage journeys to inspect the land, when natural disasters rage and the nation faces trials in every age, Your Majesty has issued an edict of self-reproach like that of Cheng Tang, and dispatched punitive expeditions as in the days of the sagely kings. The malevolent rebels shall soon be annihilated. The signs of peace and prosperity are already manifest, and the hidden blessings of this divine inscription are now revealed. How could this compare to the red bird bearing a book from Heaven, or the dark turtle bearing the hexagrams that heralded the end of calamity? Moreover, this auspicious light leapt and bounded precisely during the ritual performed by the imperial clansman—its manifestation could not be more emphatic.

They further memorialized: "Ever since the imperial banners turned southward and the Yellow Road divided to the west, when traveling through the mountains, six phoenixes have soared beside Your carriage, and when crossing rivers, twin dragons have borne the imperial raft. Swords have flown from sheer cliffs, and sacred mushrooms have flourished in the temporary palaces. Auspicious texts have floated upon the waters of Xiang River, and radiant suns have shone together over the land of Shu. All this is due to Your sagely spirit and divine protection, Your humility and self-effacement, which have moved the celestial vault and stirred the fertile earth."

At the ancient site of the Green Ram, a minister’s concentrated devotion was as steadfast as bedrock. By the fresh traces of the White Horse, the silent revelation of sacred talismans unfolded. The immortals’ secrets, vast as the enduring mandate, wove through the six characters to align with a thousand years of destiny. At the founding of the Wei dynasty, the jade seal manifested its auspiciousness within the ancestral temple; in the era of Emperor Shun, golden chariots graced the palace courtyards—such marvels transcend mere relief and defy emulation by later ages.

Grand Councilor Li Shunrong and Commander-in-Chief of the Twelve Armies and Ten Garrisons Tian Lingzi memorialized in celebration: "Now, from the imperial domain, they have come to this immortal sanctuary. No sooner had their utmost sincerity arisen than felicitous omens swiftly appeared. The crimson light now manifest upon the earth is none other than the purple-black radiance that once accompanied the crossing of the pass. Upon excavating the accumulated soil, ancient script was indeed uncovered—its soaring, dragon-and-serpent strokes confirmed the pacification of the realm’s turmoil. Emerging from the profound and secluded, its principle shines with clarity. Since the Most High has now quelled disaster, we know the harmony of the Central Realm shall perpetuate its mandate. All that has appeared stems from the sagely ancestors, and what was unearthed derives from the imperial lineage. These numinous traces make heaven’s will manifest.

Moreover, the Mysterious Primordial Sagely Ancestor has, in every time of great peril, displayed extraordinary portents—each a luminous sign, all duly recorded in the orthodox histories. Formerly, at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, Tian Tongxiu was shown the date of the restoration of the Tianbao era; now, within the Green Ram Market, Li Teli has been revealed the joyous return of Your Majesty to the palace. Truly, the realm is most fortunate. We humbly request that these events be entrusted to the historiographers."

The request was granted. On the fifteenth day, Li Teli was appointed Collator of the Eastern Palace, and Li Wuwei was bestowed the purple robe, each additionally granted two hundred bolts of fine silk.

On the twenty-first day, an imperial edict proclaimed:

The Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Primordial and his disciple, Master Wen Shi, once expounded the True Scripture upon the terrace of Louguan, where they covenanted to meet again at the Green Ram Market before ascending together upon cloud-borne chariots into the Flowing Sands. Such transcendent records and transmitted accounts are marked even upon terrestrial maps. From the reign of King Zhao of Zhou until this day, some two thousand years have passed, yet the numinous traces have remained faint, their vestiges scarce.

Now, by virtue of the imperial progress, the numinous has become manifest in radiance: extraordinary light leapt and danced before the courtyard, while divine talismans gleamed bright beneath the trees. The ancient hues of the inscribed grain and cinnabar bore verification of hidden portents. As the calamities of the era of Equilibrium and Harmony draw toward their end, the propitious omens of the fertile earth emerge in full—sufficient to attest that the Mysterious Vault bestows its protection, the Sagely Ancestor confers his auspices, the weapons of the great rebels shall be annihilated, and the enterprise of the Middle Revival shall shine eternally.

It is meet that these events be inscribed upon bamboo and silk, proclaimed throughout the realm, and entrusted to the historiographers for compilation. Moreover, let the inscribed texts be engraved and disseminated to all circuits and before the armies. The abbey shall be renamed the Green Ram Palace, and halls and chambers shall be erected therein. The adjacent lands, approximately two *qing* in area and recently dispersed among the common folk, shall be redeemed for two hundred strings of cash, with a public certificate issued to ensure their perpetual affiliation with the House of Tranquility. The imperial kinsman Li Teli shall be appointed to office, and the Daoist Li Wuwei shall be granted the purple robe. Such promotions and rewards are fitting to celebrate these numinous blessings.

With reverence befitting one who stands foremost among the public ministers, let the edict’s influence spread through commanderies and states. Let all serve with devotion in this era of extended prosperity, cultivate their minds in the realm of the Dao and virtue, and thereby cause arms to vanish within the borders and treasures to emerge from the earth. Such felicity is doubly worthy of praise.

On the seventh day of the tenth month, the eunuch official Zheng Zuntai was commissioned to oversee the construction of the Green Ram Palace, with all labor and materials supplied by the Inner Treasury. From the time the numinous signs were received until the *guichou* day of this month, the bandit gangs near Shu were successively captured and executed, and within ten days, the land was restored to peace. The imperial carriage proceeded to the Green Ram Palace, where gifts were bestowed in varying degrees. Li Teli was granted a *fei* and appointed Recorder of Longzhou. In the third year, on the *guimao* day, an edict proclaimed:

The Supreme Lord has conferred his auspices, and the Green Ram has manifested its response. It is fitting that rites of veneration be enhanced to requite these extraordinary blessings. The Purple Ultimate Palaces in all circuits, prefectures, and commanderies shall be entrusted to the local governors for repair and adornment as circumstances permit, and Daoist priests skilled in liturgical observances shall be selected to perform the offerings.

On the first day of the fifth month, the *bingyin* day, Chen Jingyi, Military Commissioner of Jiannan West Circuit and Prefect of Chengdu, in accordance with the edict, conducted the offering rites. The prayer read:

We humbly submit: since the Supreme Sage was born to receive the precious mandate and grandly inherited the great pivot of heaven, from the time he emerged from the *zhen* trigram to the moment he ascended the *qian* throne, has he not ever borne the moats of the realm in his thoughts, toiled over the governance of the decrepit, spread beneficence throughout the world, and extended grace to all that moves and grows? Though his aspiration was for purity and quiescence, fate has chanced upon hardship. Recently, rebels seized the palace, their venom spreading through the officials and common folk, startling the ancestral temples and roiling the mountains and rivers.

Thus, we tread the celestial steps to dispel calamity, and in the royal capital of Shu, we confess our faults. Relying humbly upon the profound protection of the Primordial Ancestor and the descent of numinous omens, the Six Sacred Characters have been revealed in luminous script, manifesting the thousand-year mandate of the sagely lineage. Now, indeed, the chief villain has been routed, and the ninefold palace gates reclaimed—pointing toward the Phoenix Tower, the return of the imperial procession is not far off.

Your servant, in reverent observance of the imperial decree, meticulously follows the ritual codes: casting jade tablets to present our words, purifying the golden altar to prepare the offering. We humbly pray that the host of perfected beings bestow blessings, that the Great Dao extend its grace, sweeping away the dark perversities of the Six Heavens and purging the demonic miasmas from the Nine Provinces, securing the peace of the altars of soil and grain and perpetually stilling the weapons of war. Soon after, by the encompassing nurturance of the Great Dao, the capital was recovered, Huang Chao and his cohorts of evil were executed, the realm was pacified, and the imperial carriage returned to the palace.

The Hanlin Academician-in-Attendance and Vice Minister of War, Yue Penggui, composed the *Record of the Green Ram Palace*. In the ninth month of the fourth year, the Central Secretariat and Chancellery, by imperial edict, directed the Military Commissioner of West Shu to erect a stele at the palace, stating:

From the Golden Towers descended auspicious omens; the purple and black revealed the configurations of the Celestial Pass. From the distant altar, secret portents arose; a crimson radiance surged forth as an earthly omen. Behold the mysterious talisman, inscribed in ancient seal script, at midnight when dragons and serpents stirred—six characters divided in splendor. A year later, the rebellion of the wolf-like warrior was quelled, the eight directions knew peace, the numinous efficacy was made manifest, and the restoration of the dynasty was achieved. Examining the prognostic words of the Divine Ancestor, the divine merit was displayed in the resplendent fortune of the age—how could it not be commemorated in the Daoist abbey?

Here in Shu’s riverlands, it shall be transmitted for a thousand myriad years, marking the eighteenth generation of our lineage. Yue Penggui, whose office presides over the inner brush and stands foremost among the close ministers, wields his golden words with consummate skill, inscribing them upon the stones of other mountains. His exposition is flawless, surpassing even Cai Yong’s prescient wisdom; his composition leaves nothing wanting, rendering Cao Zhi’s solitary brilliance needless. It is fitting to engrave this grand affair to authenticate this text.

Regarding Chengdu: when King Hui of Qin first connected it to the Central States, on the day of the Primordial One’s western assembly, it still lay beyond the borders of the feudal domain. Since Qin’s unification, many ancient traces have gone unrecorded. Two *li* southwest of Chengdu Prefecture stands the ancient Green Ram Market, where ancient pines and tall bamboos stretch across undulating hills. Those who dwell there often encounter strange transformations, and none dare trespass. The locals built halls and pavilions, offering incense and reverence, naming it the Abbey of the Mysterious Center.

Since the Great Tang received the Mandate, the sagely ancestors’ legacy has been honored without exception. In the north, at Laozi’s birthplace in Lai Xiang, and at Tianshui in Qishan, abbeys were erected to glorify the sagely merit—yet the Green Ram Market alone remained unadorned. When Emperor Xizong took refuge in Shu and obtained the talisman of pacification, he first allocated funds from the inner treasury to construct this palace. The stele and its inscriptions remain extant, fully recording the origins and details.

In the first year of Tianyou of Emperor Zhaozong, Zhu Quanzhong relocated the imperial carriage to Luoyang. By the second year of Tianyou of Emperor Aidi, in the fourth month of the *yichou* year, the Superintendent of the Supreme Clarity Palace, Liu Can, memorialized the completion of the Upper Clarity Palace’s renovations and requested its renaming to the Supreme Clarity Palace, to which the emperor assented. The edict proclaimed:

The August Primordial Emperor laid the foundation of the sagely lineage, spreading his protection over his divine descendants. The jade-like stream of his numinous succession, boundless as heaven and earth, and the precious chart of his steadfast mandate, enduring as the sun and moon, have been reverently honored by our dynasty through successive generations. In observance of the rites of ancestral veneration, we present texts of reverence; though the affair does not seek the true essence, it diverges from the doctrine of emptiness and nothingness. Recently, it has been customary to establish a separate palace alongside the Nine Temples. Since the relocation, we have been unable to undertake its proper maintenance, and within the Northern Observatory, offerings have been made as circumstances allowed. Though grand music is prepared, it lacks the substance of ancient precedent. The invocators, in their pursuit of distant ancestors, resemble those who sought the elusive dragon; the chief ministers, bowing in solemnity, are like those who sought the formless. Jade tablets are presented in vain, for none can match the celestial rites.

Liu Can, well-versed in ancient protocols and diligent in his weighty duties, proposed this renovation as most fitting. May it not err nor be forgotten, drawing the gaze and offerings of the divine. Moreover, upon inspecting the Mysterious Garden, it resembles Lai Xiang: the ancient halls are serene, the bridge’s trees cast dense shade, befitting the contemplation of the Purple Palace—thus it is named the Pure Abbey. To abandon the inferior and follow the superior is the mark of a wise man; to trace the source and rectify the beginning relies upon worthy ministers. Our collective deliberation finds this most appropriate, and it is worthy of special commendation.

In the second year of Kaiping of the Liang, the *wuchen* year, all Supreme Clarity Palaces, Grand Tenuity Palaces, and Purple Ultimate Palaces throughout the realm were renamed Temples of the Venerable Lord. Qian Liu, Prince of Wuyue, memorialized to restore the Temples of the Venerable Lord in the Two Zhe and Huainan Circuits to True Sage Abbeys, personally composing the stele inscription, which read:

Of the teachings of the True Sage, the Great Dao is foremost—elusive and indescribable, empty and formless, originating before the separation of heaven and earth, acting before the coalescence of primordial chaos. It encompasses the Nine Provinces and arrays the myriad things. Vast and enduring, profound beyond profundity, it cannot be exhausted by astronomical reckoning nor contained by words.

The Most High Lord Lao, his spirit congealed in primordial simplicity, his *qi* accumulated in the undifferentiated vastness, though his birth was occasioned by a stellar essence, his exalted virtue truly marked him as the progenitor of the Dao. In the eras of Fu Xi and the Yellow Emperor, he appeared under different names; through the ages of Yao, Tang, Yin, and Xia, he followed divergent paths yet remained one in essence. He established laws for the age, serving as both teacher and minister, expanding the winds of emptiness and stirring the boundaries of the subtle and tranquil.

When the Zhou dynasty was founded, the immortal sage met his destined time. Entrusted to the womb of a mysterious maiden, he took form in the state of Chu, declaring his surname as Li and transmitting his name through a vision of his ear. The twin pillars and triple gates marked his extraordinary form; his arched brows and crane-white hair further manifested his venerable age. Yet he concealed his brilliance in the public court, withdrawing as the Keeper of the Archives. Confucius of Lu marveled at the "dragon-like" sage; Master Yin recognized the auspicious *qi* of his advent. None failed to expound the *Five Thousand Characters*, and his lifespan reached eight hundred years.

When the Tang dynasty was to establish its royal enterprise, it traced its origins to this pure source, broadly opening the mysterious gate and repeatedly honoring him with exalted titles.

Thus, across the realm, Daoist palaces were established everywhere, all named "Purple Ultimate" in hope of conducting fasts and offerings. The local prefecture had once built such a sanctuary, though years had passed. Later, when great bandits swept through, they wantonly reduced it to ashes. Reflecting on the long neglect of the true Daoist wind, we therefore revived it, that blessings might be prolonged.

Examining the records and tracing the origins, we find that Lord Lao, embodying the essence of emptiness and non-being, responded to the primordial *qi*, assuming a divine form and existing before heaven and earth. During the eras of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, he styled himself Yu Hua or Guang Shou; in the ages of Yin, Shang, and Zhou, he served as Keeper of the Archives and Royal Preceptor. Moving in accord with nature, he appeared in response to the times. Later, in the reign of King Wen of Zhou, he was reborn in Ku County’s Lài Village, his Dao shaking the Central Land and his teachings spreading to the Western Regions. Yet his station was that of the Great Unity, his honorific title "Imperial Lord"; he governed the ten directions, gave life to the myriad things, matched the Three Luminaries in universal illumination, and endured through ten thousand kalpas in eternal life.

The former dynasty sought to dredge the numinous source and ascend the immortal lineage, deeming it no mere bloodline but a sacred lineage akin to ancestral pillars. Thus, Lord Lao was none other than the supreme Perfected of the Great Dao, not merely an offshoot of the Tang house. The Great Sage Xuanyuan necessarily sought the Dao on Mount Kongtong; the Most Benevolent King Mu of Zhou likewise studied immortality by the Jade Waters. Therefore, the veneration of Daoist teachings and the broad pursuit of meritorious causes flourished. Crimson towers and vermilion terraces rivaled the Penglai realms; star altars and moon halls were grandly renewed as sites for burnt offerings, ever hoping that mysterious efficacy might attain spiritual fulfillment.

On remaining vacant land, we inquired and planted pine and bamboo. White deer and azure sheep roamed freely among the spring ridges; pure winds and bright moons further adorned the autumn rivers. We established the name "Hao Capital Palace of the Mysterious Teachings," destined to endure for a thousand autumns, and renamed the "Purple Palace of the Perfected Sage of Yue" to ensure its glory for ten thousand generations. Thus, the Great Dao would ever flourish, the true wind never decline, and the teachings of the Mysterious Origin perpetually sustain the nation’s prosperity. It is fitting to carve this in imperishable stone to propagate its radiant glory.

The Zhen Sheng Abbey of Qiantang was later renamed Tianqing Abbey during the Song dynasty. The stele recording these events survives from the second year of Tiancheng in the Later Tang, when Emperor Mingzong issued an edict restoring the old titles of "Palace" and "Abbey" to the temples of Lord Lao, which had been altered by Zhu Wen.

In the eighth month, Left Rectifier Zhao Mingji submitted a memorial: "I observe that Daoist abbeys across the land have long fallen into disrepair. Since Zhu Wen’s usurpation, many were destroyed or abandoned. I humbly request that all abbeys established in our dynasty’s former territories, recently damaged or dismantled, be ordered restored to honor our ancestors and promote filial governance. This would illuminate Your Majesty’s restoration of the realm, manifest the great source of the nation’s Dao, and revive our true lineage for all time. In the two capitals, abbeys possess public fields; I beg that these be exempted from taxation to provide for ritual provisions and support properly named Daoist priests, that they may devote themselves to burnt offerings and invoke the blessings of the Supreme Mystery."

The request was granted.

In the third year, the first month, the Chancellery reported on holidays: "It is decreed that the fifteenth day of the second month, the Descendant Festival of the Mysterious Origin Emperor, be observed with a three-day holiday." The decree was approved.

In the first year of Huichang, the second month, an edict ordered a one-day holiday, and the request was again granted.

In the fourth year, the twelfth month, on the day *renzǐ*, an edict declared: "Revering the Sacred Ancestor and renovating Daoist palaces, having restored their names, it would be improper to leave them without plaques. Let the authorities craft and hang the old plaque of 'Supreme Clarity Palace.' Additionally, the Jinzhen Abbey within the capital shall be renamed 'Venerable Dao Abbey,' and its plaque likewise replaced, as it had been altered during the Zhu Liang era."

In the fourth year of Tianfu of Emperor Gaozu of Jin, the ninth month, on the day *xīnmǎo*, Daoist Master Zhang Jianming, the Venerable of Mystical Perfection, was summoned and presented with silk. Jianming, a native of Yan, had been a scholar in his youth, traveling and studying in the Hebei region, where he delved into the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi, his nature thus harmonizing with the Dao. Later, clad in cloud robes and star crowns, he embraced the teachings of spontaneity.

The emperor, long devoted to the Mysterious Origin, frequently summoned him upon ascending the throne. The emperor asked, "Can the Dao govern the world?"

Jianming replied, "The Dao is that which subtly encompasses the myriad things. It embraces the Two Modes and is called *virtue*. Those who attain its summit become the Dao; those who grasp its middle attain benevolence and righteousness; those who grasp its lower aspects attain propriety, wisdom, and trust. To lose it is to cease being human. Those who attain its ultimate may govern heaven and earth while seated on their mats—how could it be limited to governing the world?"

The emperor then invited him into the inner palace to lecture on Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*. He summoned the chief minister Feng Dao to receive the scroll and listen. Feng Dao remarked, "Daoists lecturing on *Laozi* and monks receiving full precepts—these are ancient practices, not to be taken lightly."

The emperor thus revered Jianming as his teacher and honored him even more. Once, hearing the palace’s time drum, he asked, "Does Your Majesty hear the drum’s sound? It is simply the preservation of the One. Strings, gourds, bells, and stones produce twelve tones, yet only the yellow bell harmonizes with itself; the other fifty-nine do not respond, for they issue from many gates. The drum’s sound—why inquire further? It has no gong or shang, no jue or zhi, no yu or bian, yet it harmonizes and accords—because it is One. If one can achieve undifferentiated unity in the heart, one becomes one with heaven and earth. What worry is there that the world will not return to purity?"

The emperor thus cultivated a mind of emptiness and stillness, honoring the Dao and valuing *virtue*. Hence, each audience with Jianming resulted in generous bestowals.

In the fifth month of the fifth year, Zhang Jianming was bestowed the title "Master of Penetrating Mystery." He was ordered to carve printing blocks of the *Dao* and *De* classics, and the scholar He Ning was commissioned to compose a new preface for the volumes’ frontispieces, to be distributed throughout the realm.

In the fifth year of Xiande of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, the sixth month, the emperor donated imperial robes and money to renovate the Supreme Clarity Abbey. In the sixth year, the second month, the abbey was completed, and the emperor visited it. After paying respects to Lord Lao, he inspected the bells bestowed upon the abbey.

The abbey stood outside the Qianming Gate. Initially, the emperor had heard of a bell in Pu Prefecture whose sound was exceptionally resonant, audible for dozens of *li* with each strike. He ordered it moved and bestowed upon the Supreme Clarity Abbey.

In the first year of Jianlong of Emperor Taizu of Song, on the *gengshen* day, envoys were dispatched to Bo Prefecture to offer sacrifices to Lord Lao. Another abbey, the Jianlong Abbey, was established at the Wenhe Gate—this was the same Supreme Clarity Abbey renovated by Emperor Shizong of Zhou, to which the emperor now granted a new plaque while continuing the ancestral rites to Lord Lao.

In the seventh year of Taiping Xingguo of Emperor Taizong, on the *renwu* day, he addressed his ministers: "Reading Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*, where it speaks of 'fine weapons as ill-omened tools,' and that the sage employs them only out of necessity, I have repeatedly reflected upon it as a rule of caution. Though a ruler may achieve unification through martial prowess, governance must ultimately rely on order—this deeply accords with Laozi’s principles of preserving life."

In the ninth year, he said to his chief ministers: "My daily routine is fixed: after attending to court affairs between *chen* and *si* hours, I read until late at night, retiring only to rise at the fifth watch. Even in the height of summer, I never nap during the day, nor do I overindulge in food or drink. After long practice, I find this regimen greatly beneficial. When one eats to satiety, the mind inevitably grows dull; if the limbs remain idle and one retires at once, the blood and *qi* stagnate, and illness naturally arises. How can one seek clarity and vigor thus? Laozi said, 'My fate lies with me, not with Heaven'—it all depends on one’s self-regulation. You, too, should take heed and not neglect your well-being."

In the second year of Chunhua, on the *xinmao* day, the emperor sent eunuchs Li Shoulun, Li Tingxun, and Luo Huaizhong to the military prefectures of the Two Zhe regions to select skilled artisans for the extensive renovation of the Supreme Clarity Abbey in Bo Prefecture. Thereafter, envoys were dispatched to pray for rain in times of drought or flood, and responses were frequently received.

In the third year, the emperor recited the *Dao De Jing* and remarked to his attending ministers: "The profound essence of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi lies in governing through purity and stillness—I shall strive to practice this." He continued, "In ancient times, Ji An governed Huaiyang with effortless ease, and Gongye Chang played the zither to govern Shanfu—these were applications of the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi."

Minister Lü Duan replied: "Implementing the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi to achieve great peace yields swift results."

Minister Lü Mengzheng added: "Laozi said, 'Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish'—if the fish is stirred, it falls apart. Recently, many have submitted memorials urging institutional reforms. I hope Your Majesty will foster a culture of purity and restraint."

The emperor said: "I do not wish to block the path of remonstrance. Even the words of the foolish may contain wisdom for the wise to select—this, too, is an ancient principle."

In the fourth year, eunuchs were sent to oversee artisans in renovating the Supreme Clarity Abbey. The work was completed in the tenth month of the first year of Zhidao. Thereafter, two imperial commissioners were appointed to oversee the abbey and the Dongxiao Abbey (the latter dedicated to the Primordial Celestial Empress, originally established as a temple in the first year of Yongxing of Later Han and later converted into an abbey under Tang). These commissioners served three-year terms. Annually, on Lord Lao’s birthday, the Three Primes, and other sacred festivals, grand *zhai* and *jiao* rituals were held, a practice that continues to this day.

In the fifth year of Xianping of Emperor Zhenzong, on the *renyin* day, the eunuch Chen Yanqing was sent to extensively renovate the Supreme Clarity Abbey and the Dongxiao Abbey, each assigned soldiers for maintenance.

In the second year of Jingde, on the *yisi* day, a decree prohibited logging in the vicinity of the two abbeys.

In the second year of Dazhong Xiangfu, on the *jiyou* day, a decree ordered the selection of ten Daoist priests from the Left and Right Streets to collate and standardize the scriptures of the *Daoist Canon*. By the third year, officials from the Chongwen Institute were assembled to meticulously review the texts, with Chief Minister Wang Qinruo overseeing the project.

Earlier, Emperor Taizong had sought Daoist scriptures, amassing over seven thousand scrolls. He tasked the Gentleman Cavalier Attendant Xu Xuan and Drafter of Imperial Edicts Wang Yucheng with editing them, removing duplicates, and transcribing copies for distribution to abbeys—reducing the collection to 3,337 scrolls. Now, Qinruo followed the old catalog of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, expanding the canon to 4,359 scrolls. Upon completing the compilation, he presented the catalog to the throne, and the emperor bestowed the title *Baowen Tonglu* ("Comprehensive Record of Treasured Writings"). The emperor personally composed a preface, which read:

"Before the primordial chaos was divided, this was called the Nameless. When written words arose, creation began. The subtle and profound teachings of the arcane and the wondrous, modeled on nature and born of the Supreme Ultimate, narrate the origins of the vast primordial era, expound the heart of Heaven and Earth, proclaim the words of utmost truth, and bestow blessings upon all living beings. Inscribed upon jade tablets, bound with golden cords, sealed in fine cases, and stored in precious caskets, they are guarded by the myriad spirits, enduring with the cosmos. For ten thousand generations, they shall be revered, their luster undimmed like strings of pearls. Over time, even bedrock may erode, and their marvels cannot be consumed by raging fire. Truly, they are the most divine of the divine, the greatest of the great.

Reflecting upon antiquity and extending to future ages, from the sage-kings who drilled jade and wore coarse cloth to the ministers who gazed upon them in the court, they cultivated purity and tranquility to attain great harmony. The ancestral temple and court flourished, achieving grand stability—all followed their teachings to govern, adhered to their instructions to propagate. Through conserving essence and concentrating spirit, purifying the mind and refining conduct, accumulating virtue and increasing goodness, penetrating the mysterious and communing with the numinous, one ascends to the Nine Heavens above or extends life to ten thousand years below. Within the realm of existence, none can fully fathom this; before the images of emperors and gods, we behold it here.

Our dynasty has received the great mandate, revering the primal axis. Our August Ancestor taught with profound silence, and the Divine Ancestor governed through purity and stillness. The jade halls of prosperity were venerated, the silver inscriptions of distant emulation were sought. The grand achievements of our predecessors surpass antiquity. As a humble successor, I humbly continue this blessed foundation, receiving the *Hetu* from above and guiding the celestial chariot below. Emperors of past dynasties ascended in flame, while Deng Yu compiled the *Zong* by the eddying waters. The Guo River followed the wind, the state flourished in yang, the people returned to simplicity, and all things were free from bitterness and sourness."

Should we speak only of the numinous protection of ancestral blessings to uphold grand principles? Nay, the aid of the Void and Nothingness has brought forth abundant auspiciousness. To propagate the true wind and exalt the wondrous essence, we must unfold it through the registers and genealogies, that all living beings may be enlightened.

Yet as the sacrificial years have shifted and the chapters grown vast—passed from the imperial glory of Yu the Great, is this not recent?—transmitted through the Dragon Han and Red Bright kalpas, how could distant matters be fully expounded in order, or reverence be fully expressed? Thus, We commanded the ministers of the Court of Imperial Accommodation and the Secretariat to oversee the task, selecting eminent scholars to contribute their offices. They compiled the treasured texts of the cinnabar chambers, sought the secret arcana of the purple terraces, corrected ancient seal scripts and examined regional dialects from the imperial carriages. Delving into obscurities and probing subtleties, they exhausted the refinements of textual collation; grouping and categorizing, they ensured no error in the order of scrolls. This far surpasses the ninety-three chapters of the *Han Annals* or the thirty-six methods of the *Records of Immortals*. The sequence of flying ashes spans three full cycles, the teachings of the linked blossoms achieve perfection. May these be transmitted to future generations, disseminated across the boundless cosmos, freshly inscribed with brush and ink, to be eternally preserved in the mountains.

It was at Qishou that the imperial lineage was inaugurated, and at Hangu Pass that the true ancestral teaching ascended. Truly, the Way’s orthodoxy endures through the ages. The words of composition and creation reach the utmost bounds between heaven and humanity. To mingle these with the various philosophers would be improper; to rank them among the treasured scriptures is most fitting.

From Our youthful reverence, We have upheld this imperishable luminous model. The Privy Councilor, Minister of Personnel, Acting Grand Preceptor, and Chief Councilor Wang Qinruo, preeminent in his office, ever mindful of harmonious virtue, has labored without respite in his duties, aspiring to transmit glory to posterity. Thus, he has memorialized and presented these catalogued texts, humbly requesting a preface to be offered in seasonal observance. Though the vast origins of the jade cosmos lie distant, We revere the shade of the Dao; following the *Luminous Net*’s precedent, this work may yet illumine human culture. May it guide future generations, ever increasing in reverence.

It is titled *The Comprehensive Record of Treasured Writings*.

Qinruo further petitioned that the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* and the *Scripture of the Hidden Talisman*—composed by the Sage Ancestor Lord Lao—be elevated from the Four Auxiliary Sections to the Cavern of Perfection. Earlier, an edict had ordered the removal of Daoist and Buddhist scriptures that mutually slandered one another, but Qinruo argued that the *Scripture of Laozi’s Conversion of the Barbarians* was an ancient sacred relic and should not be expunged. The edict assented.

In the fourth year of the Great Central Auspiciousness (1011), on the *xinhai* day, the Emperor offered sacrifice to the Earth at Fenyin. As the imperial procession reached Hangu Pass, He composed the *Inscription on Crossing the Pass, with Preface*:

The heart of the sagely and enlightened knows no partiality; the traces of divine transformation may appear or vanish. If the luminous legacy endures, the people will ever look up in reverence. Hangu Pass is the path by which Lord Lao ascended to the West. As for the One of Perfect Virtue who concealed His true nature, expounded teachings under a forced name, dwelled in the hidden chamber to nurture truth, and crossed the Flowing Sands to conceal His form—Confucius questioned Him on ritual and received subtle words; Yin Xi received the scripture and divined the true darkness. These events are preserved in ancient records and transmitted to future ages. Yet the Way of the supremely divine, attaining the wondrous existence of the myriad years—how could it be easily grasped?

Here, where the borders of Hua Mountain lie, where the Yellow River flows, the immortal’s chariot once passed, and its tracks remain. The pass and bridge reveal the barriers of Xiao and Han; this county and town manifest the numinous blessings of Lingbao. Thus, though people depart, the teaching endures; though ages change, the land remains. As We reverently sacrifice to the Earth and undertake this seasonal progress, We ever cherish the silent and profound wind in Our gaze, and the governance of purity and stillness in Our ancestral teacher. We shall sweep away the dust of the mundane and inscribe this upon jade-green stone.

**Inscription:**
The Teaching Father concealed His truth,
His virtue matched the divine dragon.
In divine wandering, He left silent traces—
His sagely words shine forth,
A model for all living beings.
Gazing toward Hangu Pass,
His tracks endure forever.
Boundless in mystery, infinite in purity,
The cloud-script and jade tablets
Are eternally engraved.

In the fifth year (1012), the Three Departments’ Commissioner Ding Wei was dispatched to perform the official rites. In the autumn of the sixth year, an edict announced the imperial visit to Bo to pay homage at the Supreme Clarity Palace. By then, the *heaven-ascending cypress* had long withered, but at this time, it flourished anew.

In the first month of the *jiayin* year of the seventh year (1014), the imperial carriage proceeded to the Supreme Clarity Palace for the audience. The Emperor personally presented the ceremonial jade and bestowed the august title *Supreme Emperor of the Primal Origin and Supreme Virtue of Lord Lao*. He composed the *Eulogy to Lord Lao, with Preface*:

To precede the Two Modes and give birth to the ten thousand things—this is called the Perfect Dao. To govern the Three Luminaries and spread the primal mandate—this is called the Lofty Heaven. As for the greatness of dwelling in the Dao and the sublimity of accompanying Heaven, though near in scope, it is beyond thought and measure; though its works surpass creation, it is beyond speech and knowledge.

In its timely response, it acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone; in its hidden radiance, it goes without going, yet nowhere is unreached. Thus, it abides in numinous traces, roams in divine wanderings—now appearing in indistinct presence, now soaring in profound obscurity. It dwells in the Ninefold Clarity, equal in honor to the Primal Beginning; through countless ages, it is revered as the Supreme, bestowing abundance.

Our great ancestor, Lord Lao, is truly the Perfected One. Through Him, the vast realm knows no lack; how much more so for this luminous blessed land, the birthplace of the August Emperor, where the resplendent immortal shrine stands in the domain of numinous radiance? Here, the accumulation of essence naturally gathers, and grand blessings are sought. Following the people’s acclaim and revering the primal moment, We offer this homage.

The Supreme Clarity Palace stands among the lands of Qiao Prefecture, beside the vast abyss of the Wo River—a renowned region where the Sage descended, a pure realm where the Perfected gathered. The state of Cheng Tang lies in view, the ruins of Taihao are near. The local customs are pure and steadfast, the land fertile and rich. Layered hills and high ridges command the terrain for a thousand *li*; lush forests and fine trees display verdant splendor through the four seasons. This is truly a secluded court for the numinous and immortal, a dwelling for the transcendent and divine.

Herein lies the Most High Primeval August Emperor of Supreme Virtue and Primordial Power, who discerned the obscurity of the primordial chaos and embraced the essence of the profound darkness. Emerging from the boundless transformation of the primal origin, He stands as the source and beginning of all living beings. Thus, He existed before the Great Ultimate came to be, and persists beyond its dissolution; He concludes the years that came before and endures through those yet to come.

When moved by the sun, He was conceived; by pointing to a plum tree, He revealed His lineage. From birth, He could speak, and before childhood, His hair turned white—these were the signs of His utmost numinosity. Concealing His traces beneath a tree, journeying afar across the shifting sands, He answered Confucius’s rites and transmitted the scriptures to Yin Xi—these were the bounds of His teachings. From the eras of Fuxi and Haotian through the Shang and Zhou dynasties, He appeared in each age as a Perfected One, leaving wondrous traces across generations—such was the virtue of His divine transformations.

Riding the winds and driving the clouds, He ascended to the Pure Capital of the Supreme Clarity, governing the host of immortals and disseminating the harmonious *qi*—this was the accomplishment of His shaping and nurturing. As for the principles of quiescence and non-being, the essence of purity and stillness, they originated in spontaneity and attained the utmost subtlety. Applied to governance, they harmonized with the Great Mean; applied to self-cultivation, they ascended to agelessness. Bestowed upon the world, they restored its primordial purity; instilled in the people, they brought them boundless blessings. Truly, He is the ancestor of all things and the forerunner of all teachings.

The Han dynasty revered His words, reducing punishments thereby. The Tang dynasty honored His Way, achieving great peace. Rightly do His traces spread far and wide, transmitted through countless ages without end. Our dynasty has received the precious mandate of extended prosperity, unfolding the jade-like patterns of accumulated glory. The foundation of pure governance begins with this wondrous Dao.

Our August Ancestor, the Emperor, possessed divine martial prowess yet refrained from killing, wielding shields and axes to bring the Nine Regions into submission. Our August Progenitor, the Emperor, embodied clarity and brilliance, ruling with ease and establishing teachings. Their cultivated virtues surpassed the grand reputations of all sovereigns; their flourishing numinous power left a legacy of reverence for their heirs. How could We not treasure frugality, uphold reverent silence, honor the Five Thousand Characters’ teachings, and bring peace to the multitudes?

Wherever the written chariot’s tracks reach, We aspire to a realm of benevolence and longevity; wherever the sun and moon shine, may all be bathed in harmonious clarity. Through utmost sincerity, communion is achieved, and auspicious signs manifest in response. When the divine proclaimed its favor and the great rites were decreed, pure blessings converged. The celestial chariot descended from the nine heavens to the imperial precincts, and the felicitous omens of a hundred generations resounded through the imperial lineage.

In reverent compliance and gratitude for such boundless grace, We resolved to select an auspicious site in the sacred lands to offer grand repayment in the spring season. Mindful that the Supreme Teachings originated with the Father of the Dao, whose wondrous efficacy pervades the Three Powers, and that the outskirts of Bo’s capital stand tall while the numinous ruins of Jiuque endure, We personally undertook the rites of reverent visitation, seeking counsel. The people’s acclaim swiftly coalesced into unanimous hope.

Considering this harmonious accord, Our heart was deeply consoled. Thus, We deliberated on the imperial progress to fulfill the people’s desires. Thereupon, We issued the radiant edict, charged the relevant offices, chose an auspicious day under the Regulator Star, and journeyed to the sacred court on the left of Who. Then, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the ninefold imperial procession and eightfold dragon banners advanced. Halting the reins along the imperial thoroughfare, lowering the canopy at the abode of the Perfected, the myriad officials attended to their duties as the myriad states filled the court.

Before the appointed hour, We performed ablutions, adhering to the teachings of solemn preparation. At dawn, libations were poured, and reverence was shown as if in the presence of the divine. The harmony of bells and chimes resounded, and the offerings were immaculate. Presenting the precious tablets, We elevated His august name; ascending the altar and performing the dances, We awaited the descent of the numinous journey.

As the starry heavens stretched into the distance and the palace halls loomed in profound stillness, We awaited the arrival of the wind-borne chariot, imagining the proximity of Penglai’s isles. The grand ceremony proceeded without flaw, and the blessings bestowed were sincere. Then, ascending the Great Hall and assuming the southern position, We presented jade tablets and silk, offered sacrificial animals and libations, assisting in the sacrifices to the ancestral temples and uniting with the vastness of the lofty heavens. Thus, the pure excellence of the state and family was perfected, and the great blessings of the gods and spirits were reciprocated.

Reflecting on Our humble station, We have been granted the opportunity to study the sagely designs, reverently upholding the sacred words and solemnly following the mysteries of the Dao. It is not that We indulge in esoteric practices to seek immortality, but rather to honor the quiescent and transform the realm, to emulate the pure antiquity and shelter the multitudes. As the Six Ancestral Temples bestowed their favor and the Three Spirits flowed their blessings, We have been able to receive Heaven’s gifts and share in the gods’ joy. The grand rites of vast emptiness have been repeatedly performed, and the resplendent affairs have all been made manifest. Through the fasting and dwelling in the Hall of Union, the reverent obeisance at Mount Dong was accomplished. Having followed the Dao to propagate transformation, We further exalted virtue to instruct the people.

As the imperial procession returned, the rites and decorum were fully observed. The splendid and solemn moments were engraved, that the moral influence might endure unchanging.

**Eulogy:**
The lands of Qiao Prefecture, the banks of the Wo River,
Here lies the blessed realm, where the Sage-King was born.
Embodying all wonders, He protected the people in need.
In the hidden chamber, He questioned rites; Confucius relied on benevolence.
At the Han Pass, He was seen in darkness; Yin Xi recognized the divine.
Though His celestial chariot has departed, His vast responses remain ever new.
This blessed land endures, His moral legacy boundless.
Gazing afar at the sacred halls, We heed the people’s wishes.
With feathered banners and reverent visitation, the ancient rites are upheld.
With solemn offerings and pure intent, devotion is expressed.
May His glorious name be fully proclaimed, and mutual resonance of bright responses be achieved.
We pray His majestic spirit remains undimmed, and that boundless blessings be bestowed in succession.
To proclaim and propagate His abundant principles, We humbly inscribe this enduring record.
May the sequence of auspicious omens endure through three cypress trees, and His surpassing virtue shine through ten thousand springs.

Thereupon, We commanded the painting and adornment of the palace halls, and composed the *Eulogy and Preface for the Ancient Jade and Stone Image of Lord Lao*:

The nearness of the sagely and real pervades the boundless; the realm of the numinous and bright must manifest in exceptional splendor. Gazing upon the likeness, shaped since ancient times, the eyes behold what is observable, and wondrous signs are abundantly displayed. Radiant with brilliance, it aligns with the auspicious era; adorned with beams and rafters, it illuminates the pure intent. With cloud-like banners halted, all look up in reverence. This inscription is carved in jade, that it may endure forever.

**Eulogy:**
Vast is the Father of Teachings, born in this numinous ruin.
Proclaiming the Dao and its virtue, He concealed His radiance in emptiness.
His likeness remains here, a clear and trustworthy sign spread far and wide.

Here the numinous radiance emerges, aligning with these auspicious signs.
The solemn sacrifices are renewed; the imperial carriage halts in reverence.
Carved upon enduring stone, it forever extols the grand design.

On this day—the twentieth of the first month—
a double halo crowned the sun, sweet dew descended,
immortal cranes soared, and five-colored clouds appeared,
while yellow clouds like canopies descended below.
As the imperial procession returned,
auspicious vapors filled the vista, and purple clouds cradled the sun,
transforming it through five hues.
A great amnesty was bestowed upon the realm.

At that time, Li Shunian, the twelve-year-old son of Li Ruogu, Vice Prefect of Bozhou,
presented a eulogy to recount the grand ceremony.
Summoned to the imperial presence, he was commanded to compose a poem
on the theme of the imperial visit to the Grand Pure Temple.
Taking up the brush, he completed it at once.
The Emperor praised his talent and ordered eunuchs to escort him to the Chancellery,
where he was granted the rank of *Tongzi Chushen*.
Earlier, north of the Hall of Emptiness stood a great cypress,
its branches stretching southward toward the front hall then under construction.
The craftsmen, fearing it would obstruct the eaves, reported to the officials,
proposing to trim it. One night, a great thunderstorm arose,
and by dawn, the massive bough had turned northward.
When the Emperor saw this, he marveled and halted his carriage for some time,
naming it the *Imperial Beloved Cypress*.

Many had inscribed verses upon this tree,
but none surpassed the masterpiece of Shi Manqing.
Later, Lin Jiong of Futing composed an even finer poem, with these lines:
*When the ancient hall was first to be raised,*
*the gnarled cypress, tall and twisted, clashed with the eaves.*
*Men asked why axe and adze spared it—*
*heaven’s wind and thunder turned its branches.*
*Mist-laden hues deepen as spring grows heavy;*
*moonlight graces it most fittingly by night.*
*When the True Emperor paused his carriage to admire,*
*from then its fine name would be known for ten thousand generations.*
For this records the truth.

The Emperor composed the *Preface to the Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Heavenly Youth for the Protection of Life*, stating: The wondrous origin is unfathomable, and the utmost truth responds most perfectly. That which can be spoken of is not the constant Dao; that which is non-action yet leaves nothing undone. Thus, from jade tablets and precious caskets, sacred teachings are spread; from the scripts of the *leimai* and the seal-characters of the phoenix, esoteric texts are expounded. These mark and illuminate the statutes, depicting the workings of creation, thereby proclaiming boundless benefit, aiding the great harmony of the cosmos, serving as the guideposts of the sagely teachings, and directing the senses of all sentient beings. Having received the primordial mandate, We nurture the multitudes, hoping to broaden the true canon and silently nourish all beings.

The *Scripture of the Heavenly Youth for the Protection of Life* is a secret revelation of the Supreme Clarity, a precious talisman of the Golden Portal. It has long been attested in earlier records and disseminated in separate catalogues. Should one purify the heart and recite it, or focus the mind and uphold it, one may surely dispel plagues and repel evil, attain harmony and longevity—akin to the *Scriptures of Fuxi* in establishing symbols to subtly assist the numinous, or like the *Xia Tripods* in banishing demons, so that one encounters no *chimei* spirits, averts calamities from the six extremes, and gathers blessings from a hundred auspices. Thus, We have had it transcribed for promulgation and prefaced it with this introduction. May all within the seas together delight in the blessings of life and growth.

Earlier, as the imperial heir remained long unborn, the Emperor commanded Daoist Zhu Ziying of Mount Juqu to present a memorial. Ziying, with single-minded sincerity, ascended in spirit to the imperial throne and suddenly beheld the Three Lords of Maoshan each riding a precious carriage, descending along the Yellow Way. Ziying prostrated himself to make way, whereupon he heard one among the carriages ask: "Why have you come here?" Ziying replied: "I have come to beseech the August Supreme on behalf of the Emperor Zhenzong for a sagely heir." The Mao Lord assented, saying: "This is indeed a great matter among men." Soon after, the memorial was presented to the Supreme Lord, who decreed: "The Maos possess a heart that grieves for the state and cherishes the people; they shall grant the Song Son of Heaven an heir." The following year, a royal prince was indeed born—this was Emperor Renzong.

In the early Tiansheng era, Ziying was summoned to court, where the Two August Ones held him in the highest esteem, bestowing upon him the title *Master of Observing the Wondrous*. The Qianyuan and Tiansheng Observatories were built to honor his merit. According to the *Inscription on the Stele of Master Zhu, the Twenty-Second Patriarch of Mount Maoshan and Master of Observing the Wondrous*:

> When the third generation of the imperial line bore auspicious omens,
> And the Spring Minister’s post lay vacant,
> Sacrifices were offered to the high and distant,
> While the Grotto-Heaven’s Controller of Destiny withdrew his friendship.

This refers to the events above.

In the fourth year of Emperor Renzong’s *Celestial Protection* (1026), the chief minister Wang Zeng remarked that among the scriptures of the *Daoist Canon*, some contained language that was coarse and vulgar. The Emperor replied: "The *Daoist Canon* contains many discourses on refining elixirs and compounding medicines—how could they all be like the *Five Thousand Words* of Laozi?"

Chief Minister Zhang Zhibai remarked: "The *Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue* is the guardian of purity and quiescence—it differs from all other Daoist scriptures." The Emperor replied: "When collecting and examining Daoist scriptures today, they must be meticulously collated before being admitted into the Canon."

In the second year of the *Accordant Harmony* reign (1055), on the first month of the year *yiwei*, the Emperor fell gravely ill. He summoned Daoist Liu Congshan of the Jianlong Abbey to the Great Celebration Hall to perform a jiao offering and present memorials, ordering his chief ministers to bow in his stead. As the night deepened and the memorials were being submitted, the Emperor suddenly worsened, his eyes closing for what seemed like hours. Court and kin were thrown into panic. After a long delay, Congshan finally rose and declared: "The memorials have been received. The Most High has issued a decree of deliverance—the imperial carriage returns." Moments later, the Emperor revived. He immediately sent word to ask: "Who is this General Ge?" Congshan replied: "He is the Middle Prime General of the Three Heavens’ Gate, responsible for reviewing memorials." Another edict swiftly followed, commanding that an altar be prepared for offerings.

The next day, the Emperor’s health was fully restored. Those who had witnessed the event later recounted: "From within the gate, a voice declared, ‘The Emperor was not fated to come. Quickly fetch a horse to send him back.’ And so he awoke." By imperial decree, a shrine to General Ge was erected west of the suburban altar, and Congshan was lavished with imperial robes, gold, and silks.

When Fan Zhongyan, Duke of Culture and Rectitude, served as vice-prefect of Chenzhou, the prefect sought Daoists to present memorials for his ailing mother. Fan remarked: "How could a common practitioner convey a memorial to the imperial court?" Yet as he visited the sickbed, he ordered the Daoist to proceed. The man prostrated himself for so long without moving that those present touched his body—he had stiffened. Only at the fifth watch did he rise, telling the prefect: "By the Most High’s decree, the Lady’s lifespan extends six more years. Her suffering need not cause worry." Fan questioned the Daoist about his prolonged prostration. The man replied: "As I returned from submitting the memorial, I chanced upon the celestial assembly reviewing the list of successful candidates for next year’s imperial examination. The immortals had gathered to watch, and the crowd was so dense I could not pass—hence the delay." Fan doubted his tale and asked: "Did you see the list, Master?" "How could I not?" the Daoist replied. "Who is the top candidate?" Fan pressed. The Daoist answered: "His surname is Wang, and his given name is written with *gong* above and another character below, though the lower character is smudged with ink. Another character is inscribed beside it, but the gate of heaven is too high—I could not make it out." The following year, Wang Gongshou indeed topped the examination, and the Emperor’s brush altered his name to Gongchen.

In the seventh year of the *Auspicious Aid* reign (1062), the Emperor fell ill and dreamed of three divine beings who announced their names and titles, flanked by attendants in resplendent array. Upon waking, his illness vanished. He ordered a search for shrines matching their descriptions, but none were found. Later, he discovered their identities in the *Record of the Orthodox Unity of the Most High*: they were the Three Generals. On the sixteenth day of the third month in the eighth year (1063), an edict proclaimed:

> The workings of the divine are most subtle, yet they manifest in the evident. The sincerest devotion reaches even the faintest realms. When resonance and response align as if by design, when the hidden traces of the perfected and the soaring forms of the immortals reveal themselves—then the Tang General, the Supreme Numinous Soaring Spirit; the Ge General, the Direct Envoy of the Flying Perfected; and the Zhou General, the Ascending Immortal of the Celestial Ranks, whose names are inscribed in the registers of the true, must be honored. Recently, when We were afflicted, their numinous aid restored Us to health. Without bestowing noble titles, how could their names be exalted? Without consecrating a secret chamber, how could their majesty be enshrined? Let the Tang General be granted the title *True Lord of Dao Transformation*, the Ge General *True Lord of Upright Protection*, and the Zhou General *True Lord of Resolute Will*. Let halls be built for them within the capital’s abbeys, that their radiant virtue may be fittingly requited.

In the third year of the *Prime Abundance* reign (1080), at the petition of Zhang Junshan, an edict decreed that henceforth, those seeking Daoist office must be examined on the *Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Salvation of Humankind*, and the *True Scripture of the Southern Florescence*. In the fifth year (1082), the Emperor expanded the titles of divine immortals. Yet another edict forbade the inclusion of the Three Clarities’ Supreme Lords among the ranks of the departed in Buddhist Water and Land Dharma assemblies, deeming it a profanation of the exalted perfected. Local officials were ordered to strictly enforce this prohibition.

On the night of the fifteenth day of the second month in the fifth year of the *Succeeding the Sagely* reign (1098), as the Daoist community of the Great Clarity Abbey in Bozhou gathered for their evening rites, they beheld a crimson radiance emanating from between the eyebrows of the statue of the Venerable Lord Lao. The light gradually filled the hall, piercing the tiled roof and ascending to the heavens, where it entered the Hall of the Primordial Great Sage in the Grotto-Heaven Palace. After lingering, the glow resolved into three paths: two on either side, blazing like rosy clouds, and one in the center, gleaming like a white silk ribbon. Their brilliance stretched unbroken, spanning the sky like a rainbow bridge. For hundreds of *li*, the land was as bright as day. People near and far poured from their homes to gaze upward, burning incense and bowing in reverence. After the second watch, the light slowly shifted and vanished into the Gate of Heaven.

The Abbot Observant Master Zhang Jingxian, along with Daoist adepts such as Han Weiji and a total of one hundred forty persons, and the Abbess of the Grotto-Heaven Palace, the female adept Wang Jingsu, with eighty-one others, submitted their accounts. Likewise, Li Xiang, Supervisor of the Palace and concurrently Supervisor of Liquor Taxes for Guyang Town, along with Wang Jing and one hundred ten other registered townsfolk, presented their testimonies. Prefect Yu Lu of Bozhou and his subordinates also witnessed the marvel of the divine radiance and accordingly memorialized the throne. An imperial edict was issued to hold a Golden Register Daoist ritual at the palace for a full month. Prefect Yu Lu was appointed to represent the court in receiving the mandate, while Jia Shanxiang, Chief Supervisor of the Left Street Daoists, led his subordinates in conducting the rites.

Shanxiang had once visited the Supreme Clarity Palace, where the assembly requested him to expound the *Scripture of Salvation*. By the second fascicle of his discourse, the blind regained their sight. Among the attendees was an elderly woman over seventy, who had lost her vision for thirty years; upon hearing the scriptural meaning, her eyes suddenly brightened. On the evening of the grand offering, Shanxiang dreamed that a host of divine officials transmitted the command of the Supreme Lord Lao, bestowing upon him the vestments of immortality and appointing him as the Abbot of the Supreme Clarity Palace. Several days later, he ascended in transcendence. Zhang Shangying composed the *Record of the True Journey*, which fully documented these events.

On the eighteenth day of the third month, the cyclical day *dingmao*, a blue-green memorial was presented: "The heir apparent, your subject [Name], respectfully dispatches Su Gui, Eunuch Attendant of the Inner Bureau and Supervisor of the Imperial Pharmacy, to request thirty-seven Daoist masters to conduct a month-long rite of prayer and blessing at the Supreme Clarity Palace. Upon its conclusion, a grand universal offering of thirty-six hundred altars shall be held."

The memorial continued: "Your subject humbly invokes the Supreme Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Utmost Virtue, the Jade Sovereign of the Great Clarity: The sacred precincts of Qiao and Bozhou, where the divine truth resides, have manifested auspicious omens—celestial radiance emanating from between the brows, illuminating a thousand realms. Though my virtue is unworthy, I have received this heavenly favor. Day and night, I reverently uphold the rites, daring not to slacken. On the twentieth day, as I ascended the hall to burn incense at dusk, I suddenly beheld a light beneath the eyes of the Venerable Lord Lao, like twin pearls glowing with round brilliance, which persisted until the *si* hour before dissipating. On the ninth day of the fourth month, the pearlescent radiance reappeared as before."

The prefectural congratulatory memorial stated: "...a single strand of light first illuminated the palace hall, its five hues vivid and resplendent, swiftly ascending to the heavens. Flanking it were luminous clouds as lush as festive vapors, while at its center, a white silk ribbon unfurled and coiled. It was said: 'Transformation subtly takes formless shape, and blessings naturally arise from manifest signs.' The extraordinary hues of floating clouds would be deemed a most glorious record by historians, and this manifestation of sacred favor aligns with the boundless fortune of the imperial lineage."

In the fifth month of the fifth year of the *Chongning* era (1106), Emperor Huizong issued an edict: "Those who rule the realm must revere and serve the Supreme Deity. The imperial decrees are most solemn; none dare be irreverent. Yet the followers of Śākya, in their construction of Buddhist rites, recklessly rank the Heavenly Emperor among ghosts and spirits, blurring the distinction between the divine and the spectral—nothing could be more egregious. How can they truly honor the will of the Supreme Deity? Let the relevant authorities investigate and excise such errors to reflect our awe and reverence."

Another decree stipulated: "Within the Water and Land Rituals, the altars of the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor are established. How can the lofty perfected of the Three Realms be equated with the ghosts of the netherworld? During the *Yuanfeng* era of the late Divine Emperor, an edict was once issued to prohibit such practices. Let this be reinstated and enforced."

A further edict declared: "In the past, many Buddhist monasteries displayed images of the Three Teachings as their hall or courtyard names, with Śākya in the center, the Venerable Lord Lao on the left, and Confucius on the right. This does not accord with the court’s intent to honor the celestial deities and promote Confucian teachings. Let the Venerable Lord Lao and the meritorious deeds of Daoism be relocated to Daoist temples, and let the Sage Confucius be moved to local academies, to rectify names and distinguish the teachings."

On the fourth day of the first month of the first year of the *Daguan* era (1107), the Ministry of Rites issued a memorandum in accordance with the decree: "Daoist priests shall be ranked above Buddhist monks, and female Daoist adepts above Buddhist nuns."

In the second year of the *Zhihe* era (1112), in Jiankang Prefecture, a villager named Liang Guangying had long suffered from leprosy. Fearing contagion, his family abandoned him. He took refuge at the Jade Dawn Abbey on Mount Mao, dedicating himself to hauling water for the Daoist community by day and sleeping beneath the Dragon-Tiger Lords at the abbey’s triple gate by night. After several years of such devotion, one day as he drew water, an elder with white hair and plain robes, riding a white horse with crimson mane, appeared amidst purple mist. His body radiated light, illuminating the mountains and rivers. Before him, two attendants bearing tablets shouted: 'The Supreme Lord Lao approaches!' Liang prostrated himself and kowtowed. The Venerable Lord said: 'The *Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Youth for Protecting Life* has circulated in the world for ages. Have you heard of it?' Liang replied: 'I have not.' The Lord said: 'I now bestow it upon you. Memorize it, recite it while drawing water for bathing, and your illness shall be cured. You may also use it to aid others.' He then recited the scripture, which is the *Wondrous Scripture of the Heavenly Youth for Protecting Life* known in the world today."

In the eighth month of the sixth year (1116), an edict was issued: "The Supreme Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Utmost Virtue, bears the name *Er* and the style *Boyang*, with the sobriquet *Li*; these are recorded in the classics and transmitted texts. Many among the gentry and commoners today use them as personal names, which is deeply irreverent. Henceforth, such usage is strictly prohibited."

In the eleventh month, an imperial pronouncement declared: "When the Zhou dynasty declined, a sage emerged in China, composing a work of eighty-one chapters to bequeath to later generations. Serene and solitary, he dwelled with the divine—how could one fathom him? The Han historians Sima Qian and Ban Gu, with their petty intellects and self-serving motives, composed biographies that equated him with the likes of Han Fei and Shen Buhai. In their *Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages*, they ranked him in the third tier, below Ziyou and Zixia. Such disparagement is now rectified. The *Records of the Grand Historian* shall elevate the *Biography of Laozi* to the foremost position among the biographies, forming its own category. The *Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages* in the *Book of Han* shall reclassify him among the Supreme Sages. All extant editions shall be corrected accordingly."

Yesterday, in annotating the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, it was decreed to follow the Tang precedent: let eminent ministers divide it into chapters and verses, transcribe it, and inscribe it upon stone at the Divine Empyrean Longevity Palace in the capital, to endure for eternity."

The *Subtleties of the Records of the Grand Historian* by Sima Zhen faults Sima Qian for placing the biographies of Laozi and Han Fei together, arguing that their teachings diverge entirely and should not share a single account. As the ancients have already established, his preface states: "Boyang’s teaching is pure and vacuous, while Hanzi’s is severe and legalistic; their stillness and agitation differ, and their virtue and punishment clash." Now, it is fitting that the Keeper of the Archives be paired with the Master of the Varnished Garden in a shared biography, just as the Duke of Zhou is ranked alongside Shang Yang—how could this not be excellent? The present edict elevates him to the foremost position among the biographies, forming his own category, which is even more perfect.

Furthermore, Ban Gu’s *Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages* in the *Book of Han* divides figures into nine ranks, yet places Laozi in the third. The Later Han edict of Bian Zhao states: "Ban Gu deemed Laozi’s rejection of sagacity and wisdom as the root of disorder, and thus ranked him below Confucius, whose Way is all-encompassing. This suppression placed him in the same category as Zixi of Chu." These two assessments differ greatly—truly, "those whose Ways diverge do not consult one another." It also states: "The measure of a great person transcends common judgment; how could the nine ranks constrain his name?" Lu Xisheng of the Tang likewise remarked: "Confucius personally met Laozi and inquired of him regarding ritual—there is no doubt of this. Yet Ban Gu demoted him to the third rank; though his name may be demoted, can his Way be diminished?" These are the public judgments of the world.

Thus, the Illustrious Emperor of the Tang once issued an edict elevating Laozi to the rank of Supreme Sage in the *Records of the Grand Historian*. Now, this dynasty issues a similar decree—truly, "the principles of former and later sages are one." On the twentieth day, a proclamation declared: "The Dao is present in all things. Since the Han, it has been artificially divided, and the world has drifted into vulgarity, failing to perceive its wholeness—hence its obscurity. We now renew and restore it, investigating its origins, so that the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, Yao, Shun, Zhou, and Confucius may flourish together in this age." Let all students in the empire’s schools add one major and one minor classic to their studies, choosing as they wish. The major classics shall be the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* and the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*; the minor classics, the *Zhuangzi* and the *Liezi*.

Henceforth, those who study the Dao and seek admission to the schools shall be examined by their local prefectures and counties, with guarantees provided. Those who have not committed punishable offenses, the Ten Abominations, theft, or violated the Eight Virtues shall be permitted to enter the prefectural and county schools for instruction, following the existing educational statutes. Their primary texts shall be the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* and the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* as major classics, and the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* as minor classics, supplemented by Confucian works to achieve synthesis. The Daoist classics shall include the *Book of Changes* as a major classic and the *Mencius* as a minor classic.

Previously, only titles such as Master, Dharma Master, Recluse, and Grand Master existed, with few official ranks. As their designations were lofty, their official status should likewise be elevated, though advancement remained difficult. In addition to the existing system, those selected from among the students may be appointed according to the following ranks and grades:

- **Primary Gentleman (元士)**: Principal Grade 5
- **Exalted Gentleman (高士)**: Auxiliary Grade 5
- **Great Gentleman (大士)**: Principal Grade 6
- **Superior Gentleman (上士)**: Auxiliary Grade 6
- **Virtuous Gentleman (良士)**: Principal Grade 7
- **Square Gentleman (方士)**: Auxiliary Grade 7
- **Secluded Gentleman (逸士)**: Principal Grade 8
- **Dwelling Gentleman (居士)**: Auxiliary Grade 8
- **Hidden Gentleman (隐士)**: Principal Grade 9
- **Aspiring Gentleman (志士)**: Auxiliary Grade 9

Their salaries and allowances shall follow the regulations for officials of corresponding ranks. The Divine Empyrean Longevity Palace, the Heavenly Celebration Abbey, and other palaces and abbeys shall appoint their superintendents and deputies from among those who have passed the school examinations, with the Ministry of Rites maintaining registers and making appointments in accordance with the Ministry of Personnel’s procedures. For those recluses dwelling in mountains and forests, the surveillance commissioners and prefectural governors shall, in accordance with the Eight Virtues, extend invitations to the prefectural schools and report their names.

Thereafter, Minister of Rites Xue Sichang memorialized that the Ministry of Rites should issue stamped documents to the relevant offices, and the request was approved. On the same day, an edict decreed: "Let images of Zhuang Zhou and Lie Yukou be installed in the Divine Empyrean Longevity Palace and enshrined alongside the Most High, to reflect Our reverence for the subtleties of the Dao." This shall be recorded in the *Annals of the Former Sages’ Governance*.

The editorial official Wang Li stated: "The merits of Zhuangzi and Liezi are no less than those of Yan [Hui] and Meng [zi]. Yet while the court honors Confucius and enshrines Yan and Meng as his attendants, bestowing upon them the rank of duke, Zhuang and Lie are merely classified among the Hundred Schools—no special distinction has been granted. We humbly request that the rites of veneration be deliberated." Thus, the present proclamation was issued.

On the ninth day of the sixth month of the first year of the Xuanhe era, an edict declared: "Let Zhuang Zhou be enfeoffed as the True Lord of Subtle Wonder and Penetrating Dao, and Lie Yukou as the True Lord of Attaining Vacuity and Observing Wonder," and the investiture was carried out. In the eighth month, the editorial officials of the Daoist history reported that the compilation of the *Daoist History* had reached its temporal limit. An edict decreed that the *Daoist History* should conclude with the Five Dynasties, while the present dynasty’s records should form the *Daoist Canon*.

On the third day of the eleventh month of the third year of the Xuanhe era, an edict directed the Supervisor of the Daoist Registry, currently compiling the *Daoist History*, to recognize that this work transcends ordinary historiography. While the formats of the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Book of Han* may offer models, the *Tables* section shall not be included as a mere formality. The *Annals of the Dao* shall commence with the separation of Heaven and Earth, placing the Three Pure Ones at the forefront. The sage-kings who attained the Dao shall follow the Three Sovereigns in chronological order. Twelve treatises shall be established: Heaven, Earth, Palaces and Offices, Ranks and Appointments, Chariots and Attire, Talismans and Registers, Rituals and Norms, Prohibitions and Laws, Cultivation and Refinement, Elixirs and Minerals, Sacred Writings, and Treasured Scriptures.

The biographies of male perfected beings shall begin with Feng Hou and Li Mu, while those of female perfected beings shall commence with the Nine Numinous Ones and the Primordial Lady. The biographies of all other commoners who attained the Dao shall be arranged in chronological order.

The *Annals of the Later Sage Lord Li of the Golden Portal*, composed by the Azure Lad of the Square Palaces, states: "When the two forces of darkness and light converge, the ordering of things follows its time; when the two Ways wax and wane, their emergence and withdrawal depend on the turning of fate. When the time arrives, one adapts accordingly; when the turning comes, one embraces it. In the years following the Tang, forty-six *dinghai* cycles passed, and thereafter another fifty-six *dinghai* cycles occurred. During this interval, rulers bore names of ninefold and unitary schemes. In the first year of the Jian’guang and Yanchang eras, and in the subsequent *jiashen* year, those who planted goodness and eliminated the suffering of the people, who dispelled plagues and floods, whose lands were engulfed by deluges above and ravaged by war below—all evil was eradicated, and all calamities vanished."

Those devoted to the Dao withdrew into seclusion, while the virtuous ascended the mountains. On the sixth day of the third month in the *renchen* year, the Golden Portal Sage Lord descended, his radiance illuminating the multitudes. At that time, the Sage Lord set forth from Mount Qingcheng, emerging from the clouded north of Longxi, his gaze extending beyond the realm of the Torch Dragon.

North of the Black Lands of the North lies a mountain, towering so high it brushes the heavens, its peaks locked in perpetual ice and snow, where daylight never appears. Yet when one faces north, the darkness grows brighter; gazing upward at night, one beholds the North Pole, the abode of the Torch Dragon. The Torch Dragon is the spirit of the North. As the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "Beyond the northwestern sea dwells a deity with the face of a man and the body of a serpent, clad in red. When darkness falls, its eyes shine; it neither eats nor sleeps. It is the Illuminator of the Nine Yin, called the Torch Dragon, whose light can illuminate all."

Turning westward, he passed the Pass of the Nine Streams, then eastward to the dawn-lit groves of Fulin. Gazing south toward Mount Zhu, he rode through the void in a threefold white flying chariot, followed by a host of ten thousand dragons from the emptiness. Heavenly light bathed all in its glow, and the divine mirror of the Three Luminaries was revealed. Evil men were extinguished in water and fire, while the compassionate and good were preserved as the seed of the people.

Those who first embarked on the path became immortals; those who attained the Dao became immortal officials. If one could refine the Grotto Chamber in the Upper Prime, cultivate the Nine Perfected with unceasing diligence, traverse the Hidden Scriptures of the Seven Spirits, and exhaust the Eight Simplicities with sincerity, then one would traverse the Three Calamities unharmed and surely witness renewal in the Great Peace. One would then be granted scriptures to become an immortal official, attaining long life as a divine perfected.

Thereafter, the Sage Lord would further select the most refined and wondrous among them, promoting them to fill the ranks of officials. Some would be appointed as Immortal Earls, others as Immortal Marquises, assisting the Sage in shepherding the people, ordering *qi*, and spreading virtue. Some would govern a single district, others be entrusted with the governance of an entire state. Those who could invoke the sun with solemn rites, bind the moon with lunar hymns, ascend the Great Grotto’s heights, master the Seven Transformations’ revolving verses, recite the true scriptures of the Golden Portal, wear the great talismans of the Divine Tiger, deploy the Eight Ways to summon spirits, open the Purple Writ to ride the floating clouds, chant the Golden Root to endure forever, set forth the Nine Reds to seal the mounds, command the Curved Simplicity to summon spirits, and employ the Purple Measure to manifest the unseen—those who could don the Five Phases to summon demons, embrace the Jade Tablets without cease, pass through trials and ordeals without doubt, and tread through weapons and fire without fear—all such would be appointed as Left and Right Immortal Dukes, Left and Right Grand Masters, or as ministers in the courts of the immortal marquises of the Upper States.

The Sage Lord’s procession of ten thousand dragons from the void was to observe the multitude of immortals and appoint them according to their talents. Though the Sage Lord was entrusted with governing the multitudes and gazing down upon all living beings, he himself roamed freely from the Golden Portal, dwelling in the palaces of the Upper Clarity, resting his form in the Great Void, wandering the Five Cities, and surveying the Ten Heavens, bringing peace to the hundred regions.

All who witnessed the Great Peace were those of compassionate hearts and benevolent natures, who upheld goodness without cease—whether scholars of the Dao cultivating truth, those worthy of instruction, or spirit-mediums who received scriptures, preserved their essence, and guarded their spiritual embryos; whether those who attained the Dao and became immortals, men of utmost sincerity; or those whose names were recorded in the Mysterious Register, whose seven generations bore virtue, whose blessings extended to their descendants, destined to become immortals; or those born with azure bones, able to commune with spirits and connect with the perfected; or those of extraordinary talent and serene disposition, whose heavenly endowment was pure and surpassing, who were utterly loyal, utterly filial, utterly upright, utterly incorruptible—such were the ranks of immortals, numbering in the hundreds, high and low.

The Sage Lord appointed them all according to their talents, establishing them as greater or lesser Immortal Marquises, each with their own ranks, to govern the seed of the people. Each year, the Immortal Marquises would ascend to the Upper Clarity to present themselves before the Sage Lord and receive their duties. Every five years, the Sage Lord would descend to tour the realm, visiting the Immortal Marquises, inspecting the seed of the people, and examining the governance of the immortals.

For Lao Jun would personally descend in the coming kalpa to become the True Lord of Great Peace, and thus was also titled the Golden Portal Posterior Sage Lord. In the world, when memorials were presented and petitions submitted, when dew-written memorials and written pleas were offered, all beseeched the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme Clarity, the Supreme Elder Lord of the Great Dao, the Golden Portal Posterior Sage Lord of Great Peace. For Lao Jun was the lord of the twelve hundred officials and the twelve hundred official petitions. When sealing petitions, the seal of the Nine Elder Immortal Capital Lords was used, for Lao Jun was also titled the Nine Elder Immortal Capital Lord.

For the most advanced adepts, who stilled their minds and focused their intentions, responses came in accord with their prayers. The immediacy of spiritual resonance, manifesting in sight and sound, recorded in these annals, was but a speck of dust in the vast earth. His circulation through the Three Realms, his boundless salvation of beings—sometimes revealing immortal forms and auspicious signs, even assuming fleshly bodies; sometimes flying, sometimes walking; sometimes exalted, sometimes humble; sometimes in court, sometimes in the wilds; sometimes in the Central Lands, sometimes among the barbarians—when he responded, he would conceal himself, beyond all measure. His coming was without origin, his going without destination; he pervaded all that was and was not, encompassing all things. His true body and transformed bodies alike returned to wondrous being. Praise could not reach him, nor records fully capture him.

Here, we have gathered accounts from scriptures and histories, compiling them into this *Veritable Record*.
