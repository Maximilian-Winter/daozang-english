Composed by the Altar-Consecrating Preceptor, Shangqing Great Cavern Master, Purple-Robed Servant Zhu Ziying:

In the fourth reign of the Song Dynasty’s Mandate, the third year of the *Shengjun Zaiyou* era, the August Empress Dowager Liu—whose essence was divided from the Nine Numinous, whose spirit was nurtured by the Three Primordials—ushered in an era of radiant prosperity and wielded the transformative power of treasured brilliance. Within, she cultivated harmony among the nine clans; without, she illuminated the myriad governance. Amidst the respite from ten thousand affairs, she dwelled in the realm beyond emptiness, her spirit congealing in the vast desert of the Supreme Void. Golden consorts swept the mats in the jade-green hall; jasper blossoms scattered fragrance in the chamber of vacant purity.

Yet she further stilled her spirit and calmed her thoughts, reciting the *Scripture of the Yellow Court’s* Two Luminaries. Her will and intent turned inward in cultivation, unwearied from dawn to dusk. Was this merely to restrain the hun and po? It accorded with the words of the loftiest sages, yet also aimed to return to the root and restore simplicity, thereby sheltering the multitudes under heaven. Thus, she contemplated the Three Pristine Ones, bowed to the Nine Perfected, and wore the sacred jade at her waist. The Southern Perfected gazed upon her with secret favor; the Queen Mother of the West appeared in subtle vision. The response of sweet dew was manifest by day; the merit of accumulation advanced by year. Truly, immortality may be learned, and the Dao does not operate in vain.

Still, she reflected that her refined study remained insufficient to reach the source of the Dao. Having heard that the Purple Void Primordial Lady of Southern Marchmount, Lady Wei, had in the *Xingning* era of the Eastern Jin (Year of *Jiazi*) first received the *Shangqing Great Cavern Treasure Scripture*—a sacred text of secret transmission—from the King of Lesser Existence, the True Person Qingxu Wang of the Celestial King, which was then passed down to Yang the True Person, Assistant Director of Destiny on Maoshan, and subsequently to the Shangqing Immortal Marquis, Historian Xu, she resolved to trace this lineage. The numinous source and true transmission continued unbroken on Maoshan’s peaks; the immortal branches flourished, their fragrance spreading across the seas. Thereupon, she summoned the Feathered Transcendents of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, the Profound and Wondrous Great Masters Huangfu Xiji and others, to follow the texts of Wang and Wei, and study the traditions of Yang and Xu.

They obtained the *Three Grades of Numinous Scriptures of Shangqing*, the *Hidden Writings of Jade Clarity*, the *Multitude of Secrets of the Nine Clarities*, along with the *Golden Spirit’s Two Tigers and Eight Luminaries Jade Record*, the *Supreme August Jade Taboo Register of the Primordial*, the *Flowing Gold Fire Bell and Returning Chariot Complete Dao Three Primordials Jade Tallies*, the *Nine Phoenixes’ Numinous Chapters*, the *Purple-Text White Sash*, the *Yellow Writings of the Grand Tenuity*, the *Jade Palace’s Numinous Flight Records*, and other texts totaling ten scrolls, as well as the *Golden Immortals and Jade Horses* in fifteen scrolls. In accordance with the regulations, they prepared golden dragons and jade fish, golden rams and silver horses, azure silk and golden knots, lotus-purchased brocade with phoenix patterns, plain silk from Nanhe, rosy clouds’ dust-sweeping gauze, crimson chapters’ corpse-repelling cloth, the Four Standards’ luminous mirror and spirit-quaking sword, the Five Colors’ silk robes transcending the world, Shangqing ritual vestments, and all requisite offerings for the covenant—nothing was omitted.

First, she dispatched envoys bearing secret petitions to Southern Marchmount to present her request to the Purple Void Primordial Lady, who silently assented to the hidden decree. Then, she commanded the Palace Attendant of the Inner Court’s Western Service, Minister Kang Congzheng, the Palace Attendant and Director of the Inner Court’s Attendants, Minister Jiang Deyong of the Imperial Pharmacy, along with the Right Street Vice Daoist Registrar, Administrator of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, and Concurrent Supervisor of Left and Right Street Religious Affairs, the Profound and True Great Master, Purple-Robed Servant Li Zhisun; the Left Street Supervisor and Abbot of Shouning Abbey, the Illuminated and True Great Master, Purple-Robed Servant Shi Zhizhang; the Vice Annual Administrator of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, the Profound and Wondrous Great Master, Purple-Robed Servant Zhou Suiliang; the Abbot of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, the Profound and Wondrous Great Master, Purple-Robed Servant Huangfu Xiji; and the Abbot of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, the Profound and Secret Great Master, Purple-Robed Servant Xue Qinghe—all to jointly prepare yellow petitions and plain silk, and proceed to the Chongxi Abbey on Maoshan in Jiangning Prefecture to establish the Shangqing Imperial Altar. There, they inaugurated a seven-day-and-night jade register ritual, conducting thirty-six hundred *jiao* rites over the days, and transmitting the register in accordance with the regulations. Upon completion, they separately held a three-day-and-night thanksgiving ritual, offering a grand vegetarian feast for the Daoist priests and nuns of the mountain. They cast golden dragons and jade tablets into the Huayang Cavern, and dispatched them to the Golden Mountain Water Palace, thereby pledging alliance with the Seven Sages and expressing sincerity to the Nine Clarities. Thus, the rites of transmission were fulfilled, and the etiquette between master and disciple was exhausted.

At the outset, when the imperial carriage arrived, spirit cranes descended to welcome it beneath the feathered canopy. On the eve of the ritual’s establishment, rosy clouds spread afar in the night sky. As they lodged the true writ to invoke resonance and presented refined prayers to express devotion, the orchid oil’s flame flared brightly, and stars and moon gathered in brilliance. A hundred spirits received blessings and bestowed auspices; the Five Marchmounts guarded the numinous and offered felicity. By midnight, a gentle wind arose, followed by a sudden downpour. In an instant, the Silver River stood in ordered ranks, its bright orb gleaming like white jade. All declared that the Wind Earl had swept the altar, and the Rain Master had purified the seats—was this not fitting?

On the dawn of transmission, the radiance of the Nine Auroras flowed and shimmered, congealing in illumination; the misty qi of the Three Pristine Ones drifted and floated in the void. Phoenix canopies gathered; rainbow banners shone; feathered regalia flickered; ten thousand spirits stood in solemnity. As the golden tallies were distributed and the covenants aligned, white cranes soared above the altar, and red auroras circled in the sky. Orchid winds caressed the people; numinous fragrance suffused the wilds. The onlookers stood like a wall, none failing to marvel.

Alas! The gates to the myriad wonders are many, yet learning proceeds in order; the utmost numinous is without form, yet resonance requires no waiting. Herein lies the Empress Dowager’s devotion and sincerity. She harmonized with the firm and yielding, served humans and spirits, summoned transcendent immortals, and aligned with the hidden mysteries. Without the virtue accumulated over vast kalpas, without the supreme fruits of countless lives, who could attain such heights?

Thus it is known: when one excels in a good beginning, beauty follows; when one completes plans with the Dao, what cause is there for concern that it will not be perfect? For such as this, the chariot of Eight Radiant Flying Auroras, the feast of Three Primordials Flowing Clouds, the treasures of Ten Essences Returning Waters, and the delicacies of Nine-Hued Phoenix Brains—all shall be summoned without delay.

With reverence, we consider the sagely intent: upholding the secret scriptures as if they were divine, desiring thereby to manifest devotion to the Vast Heaven, to safeguard the True Sovereign, to secure the imperial lineage for ten thousand generations, and to bless the common people with triple harvests. May weapons of war be stilled forever, and all together partake in abundance and longevity. As for the calculations of the Later Heaven, the boundless mandate, the far-reaching golden branches, and the gifts bestowed upon the black-haired people—how fitting it is!

Observing the accomplishments of this era and examining what the hundred kings have left unrecorded, we faithfully set down this account with an unadorned brush.

Recorded on the twenty-third day of the fourth month, the day *gengchen*, in the second year of the Tiansheng reign, the *jiazi* year. *The Record of Empress Zhangxian Mingsu Receiving the Shangqing Complete Method Register is hereby concluded.*
