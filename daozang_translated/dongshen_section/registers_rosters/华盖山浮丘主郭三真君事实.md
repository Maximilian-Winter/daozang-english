**Preface to the Factual Records of the Three Immortals of Huagai Mountain**

The Dao of immortality has been revered since antiquity, yet the records of it in the world often lack detail. Some dismiss its subtleties as obscure and its manifestations as fantastical, branding them as illusory. But who can deny the luminous traces and wondrous deeds of the transcendent, so resplendent and undeniable? How, then, can they be uniformly condemned as falsehoods?

In Chongren County stands Huagai Mountain, also called Baogai Mountain, where the shrine of the Three Perfected—Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo—resides. Fuqiu, who roamed with Master Rongcheng and the Yellow Emperor, later transmitted the Dao to Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou. In the Han, he taught poetry to Master Shen and befriended King Yuan of Chu, guiding Wang Bao to immortality. He is none other than the ancient Lord Fuqiu. Some identify him as Wang Fangping, while Guo is said to belong to the Wang clan, adopting the surname of a local magistrate—though the details remain uncertain. Yet, upon examining the ages, it is plausible that perfected beings manifest in accordance with the times, their transformations boundless. The theory of adopted surnames, however, is but vulgar hearsay, unworthy of credence.

By the Yuan Kang era of the Jin, Wang and Guo began their discipleship under Fuqiu. In the second year of the Yongping reign (of the Eastern Han), on the first day of the second month, the two ascended as immortals, and from that time, the mountain gained renown. According to the *Purple Clarity and White Perfected One*, Fuqiu was born in the Shang, served in the Zhou, recluded in the Han, and transformed in the Jin. By the Kaihuang era of the Sui, he still lingered on Huagai Mountain in Baling. The Song and Yuan dynasties repeatedly bestowed honors upon him with titles.

Other mountains bearing the names Hualin, Xiaolu in Hengzhou, Fuqiu in Tanzhou, Baogai in Jiangling, as well as Huangshan in She County, Xuanzhou, Taiping Prefecture, and Jinhua—all preserve the traces of the Three Perfected. At that time, eminent scholars and great officials, such as Yan Lugong, Li Zongkua, Li Chongyuan, Wu Wenzheng, and Yu Wenjing, left meticulous records. The *Extensive Records* further document countless instances of prayers answered during droughts, plagues, and illnesses, with responses as abundant as the verdant cypresses. Thus, the shrines dedicated to them number over a hundred—could this not attest to the boundless efficacy of the supremely divine?

In my youth, I admired their numinous traces. In the *Jisi* year of the Hongwu reign, I had the fortune to visit their shrine. In the *Renshen* year, I was dispatched by imperial decree to offer incense on the mountain, and wondrous signs manifested. Later, when my wife, née Kong, fell ill, our prayers were swiftly answered. In the autumn of the *Jiashen* year of the Yongle reign, I revisited the shrine. That night, I dreamed of an immortal in white robes seated within my chamber. The next day, as I ascended the peak, the rain ceased at noon, and at night, a celestial lantern appeared at the foot of the mountain. On the first day of the ninth month, as the rites concluded, a radiant orb emerged in the Purple Mystery Grotto, vast as a room, its brilliance dazzling, as if an immortal dwelled within. I bowed twice and took my leave. Upon my return, moved by the divine power of their boundless virtue, I was compelled to compile these marvels.

Alas! How could one fully believe what has not been witnessed firsthand or heard with one’s own ears? Moreover, true immortals and divine transformations rarely appear in the world. Their numinous essence and immortal bearing arise from innate wisdom and the perfection of the Dao, and thus their divine efficacy endures, bestowing blessings upon all ages without end—this is only fitting.

This mountain, towering in sublime beauty, stands far beyond the dust and haze of the mortal realm. Who among the cloud-wreathed peaks and rosy mists that drift and descend here would fail to record its wonders? Yet the accounts left by predecessors are often coarse and unrefined, their embellishment long deferred.

This summer, by imperial decree, I was entrusted with compiling the Daoist canon. With reverence, I have appended this record, placing its authentic marvels at the forefront, so that in ten thousand generations to come, those who yearn for the immortal realm may not dismiss it as mere fantasy or delusion. The vast blessings bestowed upon the people, enshrined in the nation’s sacrifices, shall endure as long as this mountain—is this not magnificent?

Written on the Duanwu Festival of the fifth year of the Yongle reign, by Zhang Yu Chu, the forty-third Heavenly Master, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Expounder of the Dao of Non-Action, and Patriarch of Illuminating Virtue, who oversees Daoist affairs, with solemn purification and respect.

That which is called *divine* is what remains numinous after death; that which is called *immortal* is what attains eternal life—these are distinct paths. The divine often ward off calamities and nurture the people, while immortals focus solely on cultivation and ascension, rarely extending their virtue to others. Yet the Three Immortals of Huagai are different: prayers for rain are answered with rain, prayers for healing bring recovery, pleas for offspring are granted, and requests for medicine fulfilled. Multitudes from all directions have received their blessings—this is why hearts are so deeply moved and reverence arises.

The stele inscription by Yan Lugong records their story in great detail, stating only that the two immortals ascended on the first day of the second month of the third year of *Yuankang* in the Jin dynasty. Yet consulting the *History of the Jin*, there is no *Yuankang* era—only *Yongkang*. Was this an error in the master’s brush? I note this doubt for the consideration of those who may know.

Respectfully inscribed on the first day of the ninth month of the *Xinyou* year of the Jingding reign, by Zhu Huan, a humble official of Chongxi, from Yueshan.

Born of the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth is humanity; wondrously moving these transformations are the gods; standing majestically as the weighty pillars of these transformations are the mountains. Mountains gain their numinosity through the gods, and people find peace through the gods—if the gods dwell in the mountains, how could people revere the gods without also honoring the mountains? Such is the natural principle and the inevitable tendency of things.

Mount Hua in Fuzhou rises with three peaks piercing the clouds, the loftiest range in the lands south of the Yangtze. It is the place where the Three Perfected Lords—Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo—attained the Dao and ascended in flight. When the realm suffers drought or flood, prayers are offered to them; when the people are afflicted by illness or plague, they are entreated. Perils are turned to safety, misfortunes to blessings; the faintest stirring of sincerity in the heart meets with an echoing response. Pilgrims come to pay homage throughout the year, and in autumn, the crowds swell even more.

On the first day of the ninth month of the *Gengzi* year of the Jingding reign, I, Xiang, accompanied by my fellow villager Wang Keming and the Daoist adept Guo Shoucheng, journeyed to the mountain to pay our respects. Suddenly, we beheld the halls and pavilions gleaming in fresh splendor, their adornments magnificent and grand. That night, we performed a jiao ritual at the altar. Upon its completion, we met the mountain’s abbot, who offered us tea and engaged in conversation. His discourse was refined and unconstrained, his bearing refreshing, his manner toward others courteous and warm. Free from any craving for profit, he was truly a man of the realm of immortals.

Upon inquiry, we learned his surname was Chen, his given name Yuanying, his courtesy name Xianzhe, and his Daoist name Jingshan. He told us he had wandered rivers and lakes for two hundred and forty *jiazi* cycles. He had once served as the leader of temples such as Jintan on Mount Jiang, Kaiyuan at Yellow Crane, Chengtian at Jade Bamboo, Shouning on Mount Nanyue, Shousheng at Hualin, and Qianyuan in Pingjiang.

I smiled and asked him, “Why forsake the jade palaces and jeweled towers to dwell on this towering mountain peak, exchanging refinement for solitude? Do you not yearn for the Dao as Wang and Guo once yearned for Fuqiu?”

The abbot grew solemn, his demeanor exceeding all measure. “How could I dare compare myself?” he replied. “Setting that aside, the perfected immortals have a request of me. The halls of the Three Perfected Ones stand in disrepair, and the images of the Three Immortals have been restored in splendor, yet their true records are lacking. Once, such records existed, but in the *Wuwu* year, the numinous power of the Flame Emperor reduced them to ashes, and they are no more. Could you inquire on the mountain’s behalf and arrange for their carving?”

Having long received the blessings of the immortals, we were delighted upon hearing his words and readily agreed. The next day, my brother Wang and I lit incense at the altar, bowed respectfully before the Three Perfected Ones, and vowed to publish these records. Upon returning home, we sought the original text and eventually obtained the version compiled by the Daoist Huang Mijian. Though its account was somewhat brief, it detailed the imperial titles bestowed upon the Three Perfected Ones by successive dynasties, the prefaces written by renowned scholars of past ages, the course of their cultivation and ascension, and the verified traces of their numinous responses. Compared to Huang’s version, our text was more detailed, though each had its strengths and omissions.

Though we are unworthy and dull, we combined the merits of both versions and arranged them into fourteen scrolls. We dared not presume to correct their errors but merely preserved the originals for the consideration of those who might know better. Nevertheless, Mount Hua is a vital stronghold of the south, and the Three Perfected Ones are its numinous deities, bestowing abundant blessings upon the people. Surely among the people there are those of outstanding talent who could correct its errors and amend its flaws—would this not be fitting?

On the *Zhenyuan* festival of the *Xinyou* year of the Jingding reign, your humble disciple Liu Xiang of Luling, along with Wang Keming, bow a hundred times in reverence and speak these words with purified hearts.

The deeds of Perfected Lord Fuqiu are widely recorded in various books, so scholars are generally familiar with them. However, the immortal paths of the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, would not be fully known had not Yan Lugong and Li Chongyuan gathered their deeds and recorded their histories. Observing their devotion to their master’s teachings, their tireless travels through mountains and rivers, their disregard for peril and distance, and their accumulation of merit and virtue—growing ever more manifest while their traces grew ever more subtle—does this not embody what Laozi meant by “practicing the Dao day by day, diminishing and diminishing again, until one reaches non-action”?

Alas, how difficult it is to attain the learning of immortals! Yet why is it that among our own circle, those who study the teachings of our Master Confucius so rarely reach his realm? If they could apply the same dedication as the Two Perfected Ones to the study of our Master’s teachings, would they not attain the highest attainment? This should serve as encouragement for us Confucians.

Regrettably, the printing blocks were destroyed in the *Renchen* military upheaval, and few have since heard of these records. Jiang Bicheng, the current caretaker of this mountain’s shrine, has rebuilt its halls, pavilions, and abbot’s quarters. Yet he lamented that the mountain’s numinous responses are so profound, yet its true history risks fading into obscurity—this cannot be allowed to happen. Thus, he sought out the complete collection, compared it with the surviving fragments, and urged those devoted to the Dao to join forces in carving new printing blocks to disseminate its teachings.

A man of virtuous bearing, Kong De, who oversees the Xuanmiao Abbey, supervised the project. Another, Sha Youhe of the city, donated funds to complete the work. Within a few months, the task was finished. Such is the depth of the immortals’ virtue and blessings, and the extent of their power to move people.

He asked me to write a preface. My ancestor of four generations past, Lüfeng, along with his brothers, restored the Jade Court Abbey and renewed the images of the Three Perfected Ones and the host of sages. They also built a retreat beside the Purple Mystery Cliff as a place of seclusion. Though it has since endured the fires of calamity, the old name of Zhang Family Lodge remains to this day. Their loyalty and generosity have not faded, for good deeds have their origins.

Now, to have my name linked with the register of immortals is my great fortune—how could I refuse? Bicheng is of a gentle and pure disposition, treating others with generosity and never grasping for profit. His sole concern is the repair and maintenance of the temple. Each day, he says, “This is the duty of our generation.” If all who dwell on this mountain could devote themselves as Bicheng does, diligently tending to its rituals and sacrifices, the mountain’s revival would not be difficult.

Bicheng’s courtesy name is Yuanyuan. When the forty-third Heavenly Master visited the mountain, he praised Bicheng’s youth and adherence to the pure regulations, composing several poems in admiration of the scenery. These were collected, and he was granted an official title, his name changed to what it is now.

This too marks a grand occasion for this mountain, and so it is recorded here.

In the summer of the fifth month of the *xinwei* year of the Qinglong era, Zhang Yan of Nancun Village composed this preface.

*Veritable Records of the Three Perfected Lords Wang and Guo of Fuqiu on Huagai Mountain, Scroll One*
Compiled by Daoist Shen Tingrui of Yunsun Mountain

According to the *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia*: In the northwest of She County lies Mount Huang, towering 1,180 *ren* in height, from which the Feng and Luo rivers flow. In the sixth year of the Tianbao era, its name was changed to Mount Beihuo (pronounced "Yi"). The mountain boasts peaks that scrape the heavens and block the sun, with cloud-wreathed grottoes, cavernous cliffs, and cascading springs adorning every summit. At its heart stands the immortal altar of Lord Fuqiu, where iridescent birds of spirit alight. Legend holds that the Yellow Emperor once journeyed here with Master Rongcheng and Lord Fuqiu for a grand assembly. Long ago, a traveler who reached the altar suddenly beheld resplendent pavilions, a lotus pond before them, and mounds of salt and grain to either side. Returning with companions to retrieve them, they found the place vanished without a trace. From the mountain’s base, the strains of celestial music could often be heard drifting down from above.

Further, the *Nine Realms Gazetteer* states: Xuanzhou also has a Mount Huang, where the Yellow Emperor and the immortal Fuqiu refined elixirs. Fuqiu’s immortal altar stands precisely on Tiandu Peak. Taiping Prefecture likewise has a Mount Huang, also called Mount Fuqiu, where Fuqiu raised immortal parrots.

Lord Fuqiu initiated the Crown Prince Wang Zijin
Lord Wang, named Jin, styled Ziqiao (also called Qiao, styled Zijin), was the crown prince of King Ling of Zhou. Born with divine prodigy, he loved the Dao from childhood. Though he dwelt in the palace, he often went without food, and in moments of serene stillness, immortals would descend to him—unseen even by those at his side. Fond of playing the *sheng*, he produced melodies like the cries of *luan* and phoenix, their notes piercing the clouds and filling the palace halls. White *luan* craned their necks and flapped their wings to listen, while rare birds and exotic fowl danced upon the courtyard steps as if it were commonplace. One day, the immortal Fuqiu of Tiantai Mountain descended to impart the essentials of the Dao, teaching him the methods of refining *shijing* and *jinguang*, concealing his radiance, and forging his form. This occurred in the twenty-second year of King Ling’s reign. When the Luo River threatened to inundate the royal palace, the king sought to dam it. Prince Jin remonstrated, but the king refused to heed him, ultimately damming the river against his counsel.

Fuqiu bestowed an elixir upon Prince Jin
After the prince’s admonition was ignored, he withdrew in displeasure to a separate palace to fast and meditate, longing for Fuqiu. The immortal secretly descended to his chamber, granting him a divine medicine and escorting him to Mount Song. Years later, his friend Huan Liang encountered Prince Jin atop Mount Wei. The prince told him, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, I shall ascend to heaven. Come bid me farewell with my old friends.” When the appointed day arrived, the prince’s companions and Huan Liang climbed the mountain early, finding the horse he had ridden drinking from a stream below. At the promised hour, Prince Jin mounted a white crane, waved farewell to the people of his time, and ascended into the heavens. As his attendants bowed in parting, the horse he had ridden also took flight into the sky. Today, only the *Baimajian* (Stream of the Parting Horse) remains. Prince Jin now serves as the Right Assistant, attending the Celestial Emperor and overseeing the Perfected Lords of the Five Peaks. In his youthful form, he stands eight *chi* tall, a halo of light crowning his head—all recorded in the *Biographies of the Wang Clan of Leimai*.

Fuqiu imparted the study of the *Book of Songs* to Master Shen
The *Book of Han* states that during Empress Lü’s reign, Fuqiu Bo still resided in Chang’an. King Yuan of Chu and Master Shen studied the *Book of Songs* under him. He was likely a native of Qi. In Han times, Fuqiu concealed himself among Confucian scholars, much as Laozi had hidden among the archivists.

Fuqiu initiated Wang Bao
Wang Bao, styled Zideng, was a seventh-generation descendant of Wang Ling, the Marquis of Anguo, and the son of Wang Kai, a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. Born in the thirteenth year of Emperor Yuan’s reign (the *yiyou* year), he devoted himself to the classics from a young age. The Grand General Wang Feng appointed him as an attendant, but he remained aloof and unyielding. At forty-three, he knelt to take leave of his parents and sought the Way of immortality.

Entering Mount Huayin, he rested in the empty forests, where birds and beasts became his companions. His toil was arduous, reaching its utmost limit. For nine years thus, a great snow felled the trees, and the hollow cliffs fell silent—he nearly perished, yet his sincerity never wavered, and the profound and mysterious was moved by his truth. At midnight, he heard the sound of flutes and drums, drawing ever nearer. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the void, divine beings each mounted upon three-tiered clouds, their hands bearing tiger tallies. They halted their carriages and spoke: "I am the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, Xiliang Ziwen." Another Perfected One said: "I am the Hua Gai Supreme Duke Fuqiu Bo. We have heard of your devotion to the Dao, your toils in the mountains and forests—your resolve is truly pitiable."

Wang Bao kowtowed ten thousand times, entreating them to bestow upon him the Dao of longevity. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said: "We oversee the offices of divine transcendents and, moved by your aspiration, have come to visit you." Thereupon, they transmitted to him the *Supreme Ultimate Azure Essence Rice* and the *Methods of the Upper Transcendents*. Fuqiu Bo imparted to him the *Five Spirits’ Nocturnal Contemplation Dao* and the treasures of *Cloud Jade and Frosted Ice*. Bowing twice, he ingested them. Thereafter, his body radiated a golden glow, a halo formed around his neck, and he could traverse ten thousand *li* in flight. He was conferred the sacred tally and appointed as the *Great Simplicity Pure Emptiness Perfected One*, governing the *Lesser Existence Heavenly King*, presiding over the Three Origins and Four Offices. He was granted three hundred jade lads and maidens each and permitted to ride the *Eight Radiance Flying Chariot*, ascending and descending the *Upper Clarity*. Today, the *Immortal King Peak* of the *Lesser Existence Heaven* in Mount Magu is also where the Perfected One holds sway.

Recorded in *The Wang Clan Records* and *The Xujiang Gazetteer*.

**The Traces of Fuqiu Bo**
*The Yuzhang Prefecture Gazetteer* states: In ancient times, Fuqiu Bo concealed himself on Mount Hualin, and thus the southern peak of the mountain was named *Fuqiu*. The mountain has three peaks, all towering, perilous, and exquisitely sheer, spanning a hundred *li* in circumference, where no noxious grasses or fierce beasts grow. There are three abbeys called *Fuqiu*, now located fifty *li* southwest of Fengxin County in Yuzhang. There is also the *Hualin Spring*, another trace of Fuqiu Bo.

*The Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* further records: In Hengzhou, there is a *Lesser Mount Lu*, also called *Fuqiu Mountain*, situated one hundred and eight *li* west of the county. It rises six *li* and three thousand *bu*, extending twenty *li* east to west and forty *li* north to south. The mountain is said to resemble Mount Lu in Jiujiang, hence its name *Lesser Mount Lu*. Ancient traditions hold that it was the site of Fuqiu Bo’s ascent to transcendence, and a Daoist abbey still stands there.

*The Nine Regions Gazetteer* also notes: In Tanzhou, there is a *Fuqiu Mountain*, and in Jiangling Prefecture, a *Hua Gai Peak*—both traces of Fuqiu Bo.

During the reign of Emperor Shenwu of Tang, envoys were dispatched to Mount Hua Gai and Mount Hualin to cast *jian* tablets.

Emperor Li Longji of the Great Tang, the Divine Martial Emperor of Kaiyuan, born in the eighth month of the yiyou year, from his youth cherished the true Dao and yearned to receive the immortal arts of longevity. Though his exalted position as sovereign prevented him from making pilgrimage in person, he respectfully commanded the eminent scholar Sun Zhiliang to cast a treasure tablet of trust into the stone chamber of Fuqiu, to serve as a golden dragon courier.

The jade-green *yao* stone was inscribed with mountain charts and miscellaneous records.

The *Illustrated Classic* compiled by Li Zongkua, Hanlin Academician of the Song, states: *Baogai Mountain* lies two hundred *li* south of the county, rising twenty-two *li* in height. Its form resembles a treasure canopy, whence its name. At its summit stand the altars of the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo.

The stele inscription of the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, recorded by Yan Zhenqing, Duke of Luji of the Tang, notes: According to the regional map, *Huagai Mountain* in Chongren County of the subordinate prefecture is the site where the altars of the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, remain. The imperial decrees of ennoblement and the veritable records of inscriptions from the Song all refer to it as *Huagai Mountain*. Now both names are recorded here to inform later generations.

*Stele Inscription of the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, at Qiaoxian Abbey, Chongren County, Fuzhou, Tang Dynasty*

The Honorable Yan Zhenqing, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Acting Prefect of Fuzhou, and Duke of Lu Commandery, both composed and inscribed this text.

In the lands south of the Yangtze, renowned for their beauty, amidst the mountains and peaks, lie grotto-heavens of the immortals. I, humbly bearing the imperial grace, serve as Surveillance Commissioner of Linchuan. One day, consulting the regional map, I discovered that in the subordinate county of Chongren, *Huagai Mountain* preserves the altars of the Two Perfected Lords, Zhu and Guo. Delighted to witness such marvels, I sought their origins but found none. On another day, during my official duties, I dispatched military officers to the mountain’s base to seek stele inscriptions. Indeed, they recovered a stone record, which revealed that in the fifth year of *Kaihuang* of the Sui, the Daoist adept Li Zizhen had transcribed anew the text from a damaged stele. From this, we learn that the Two Perfected Lords, Zhu and Guo, though their names were not widely known in the mortal realm, were in fact disciples of Master Fangping, with Guo being Zhu’s younger clansman. They first cultivated the Dao on *Jinhua Mountain*, aspiring to ascend lightly into the heavens. Wandering through grotto-heavens, they journeyed from *Yusun* to *Magu Cave*. Midway, they passed a mountain and inquired of an elder: “What mountain is this?” The elder replied: “This is *Baling Huagai Mountain*.” The Two Perfected Lords remarked to one another: “This mountain is a blessed site, and its name is most auspicious.” Thus, they sought to divine a place to reside and refined their elixirs anew. The elders of the mountain’s foothills approached, bowing, and asked: “May we know the names of the Perfected Ones?” They replied: “We cultivate our will in the realm of emptiness and do not wish to speak of such things.” Later, a Daoist arrived to pay respects and inquired: “Who is the master of the Perfected Ones?” They answered: “Our master is Master Fuqiu, a great immortal of the upper realms. We encountered him on *Jinhua Mountain*.” The Two Perfected Lords could command stones to fly and talismans to soar, summon clouds and bring forth rain. If someone suffered from sudden illness or death, they would petition the Perfected Ones, who would dispatch a talisman to save them. In times of drought, they would invoke timely rains to relieve the people. On the first day of the second month in the third year of *Yuankang* of the Jin, colorful clouds stretched across the day, and immortal music filled the wind. The Two Perfected Lords then mounted simurghs and rode cranes, ascending slowly into the heavens. Today, the altar of their ascension and the altar of Master Fuqiu remain. Thereafter, an abbey was established for cultivation, and whenever the region faced drought, prayers at the altar would summon clouds and rain without delay.

How wondrous! The events are resplendent, the immortal traces vivid and unmistakable. Though absent from historical records, how could their fame and glory fade? Simurghs and cranes soar in pairs, together becoming guests of the celestial realm; peaks and forests vie in beauty, harboring a spring beyond the mortal world. Thus, I discussed with the prefectural officials the need to honor the abbey’s halls and ensure perpetual cultivation. Soon after, I dispatched military officers with public funds to the mountain to renovate the halls, gates, and corridors. They returned in no time, reporting the work complete.

I, in my virtue, am ashamed of my fondness for the Dao, yet unworthy as I am, I hold this office. Tracing the origins and seeking the culmination, I can scarcely fathom the day of their ascension. Thus, I compose this text and inscribe it in ink, leaving a fragrant legacy for a thousand generations.

**Inscription:**
The gate of the Mysterious Female,
Preserves the heart and nurtures the spirit.
Many are those who study,
Few are those who attain.
Gently through the ages,
Majestic stand the Two Perfected.
Elixirs refined in the valleys,
Their Dao responds to the vast heavens.
Colorful clouds glow resplendent,
Immortal music sounds in harmony.
The lingering sun shines bright,
Peach blossoms bloom anew.
Simurghs soar beyond the mundane,
Cranes ride above the clouds.
They return to the Purple Palace,
Laughing as they depart the fragrant dawn.
The mountain, *Huagai*, endures,
Forever harboring an extraordinary spring.
Grace flows in abundant blessings,
Relieving the needs of the people.
Swift as drifting clouds,
Frequent as the waxing moon.
Venerable as a sacred site,
Their pure fragrance spreads eternally.

**Record of the Three Perfected**
Composed by Li Chongyuan, Transport Commissioner of Jiangnan West Circuit

The mountains and waters of Linchuan are numinous, abounding with the vestiges of immortals from former ages—cinnabar wells and immortal altars appear in profusion. In the texts of maps and records, these can be verified, yet the shrine of the Two Perfected Lords, Zhu and Guo, on *Huagai Mountain* in Chongren stands out for its particularly luminous traces. The Tang-era *Record* by Yan, Duke of Lu, drew from the old stele of the fifth year of *Kaihuang* of the Sui but omitted their names, native places, and lineages, noting only that they encountered Master Fuqiu on *Jinhua Mountain* to receive his teachings. Later, they resided on this mountain, where they could command talismans to fly and stones to move, summon clouds and bring forth rain, reviving the dead and healing the sick. In the third year of *Yuankang* of the Jin, they ascended to the heavens. When contemporaries inquired about the names of the Perfected Lords, they kept them secret. Thereafter, in times of drought or flood, prayers at their shrine were answered without delay.

In times of plague or pestilence, men and women of the prefecture would come to pray for deliverance, and none failed to seek their aid. Even those traveling from neighboring prefectures, thousands of *li* away, approached with reverence, fasting and purifying themselves before daring to ascend the mountain. Should they fail to do so, wind, thunder, rain, hail, tigers, leopards, snakes, scorpions, and hornets would swiftly descend upon them. Within the shrine stood an image of Master Fuqiu, and atop the mountain, the immortal’s altar still remained.

During the *Xining* era, the prefecture reported the extraordinary deeds of Lords Wang and Guo to the imperial court. Emperor Shenzong bestowed upon Wang the title *Chongying Perfected Lord* and upon Guo the title *Chengying Perfected Lord*, yet inadvertently omitted the affairs of Master Fuqiu, leaving his honorific unbestowed. In the second year of *Yuanyou*, when Hongzhou suffered a summer drought and its people wore expressions of distress, Vice Censor-in-Chief Wang Huan, serving as Transport Commissioner and acting prefect, heard of the three Perfected Ones’ responsiveness. He then adopted a vegetarian diet and purified his dwelling, dispatching Ye Zuwen, Registrar of Chongren County, to the shrine to welcome the true images to the prefectural city. There, he led his officials just beyond the city gates to receive them, lodging the images in the Temple of Celestial Celebration. Dark clouds soon gathered, and as incense was burned and earnest prayers offered, rain poured down in torrents. Only after three days did the skies clear, and the crops flourished. The people of the prefecture rejoiced, marveling at what they had never before witnessed, and none failed to praise the beneficence of Lord Wang.

Lord Wang remarked, “Master Fuqiu was the teacher of the two Perfected Lords, yet no honors have been accorded him. This falls far short of the reverence due to a lofty Perfected One.” He then ordered the magistrate of Linchuan to compile the full account of Master Fuqiu’s deeds and petition the court for an imperial decree. He entrusted the gatekeeper Li Chongyuan to investigate the matter and record it.

Chongyuan carefully examined Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals*, which states that Prince Wang Zijin encountered Master Fuqiu and was led by him to Mount Song. Yet the *Book of Han* records that during the reign of Empress Lü, Fuqiu Bo still resided in Chang’an, where Liu Jiao, Prince Yuan of Chu, studied the *Book of Songs* under him. He was likely a native of Qi. The Tang-era *Yuanhe Genealogies* by Lin Bao also mentions Fuqiu Bo, noting that Prince Zijin studied under him. Since Zijin was a prince of Zhou, Fuqiu must have lived even earlier, though the span of his years remains unknown. It seems that during the Han, he concealed himself among the Confucian scholars, much as Laozi had once hidden among the archivists.

Alas! The study of divine transcendents did not exist in ancient times. Only after the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han became enamored with the arts of immortality and longevity did the world first learn of divine transcendents. Liu Xiang later compiled the *Biographies of the Immortals*, yet included only Prince Wang Zijin’s teacher, Master Fuqiu, while Fuqiu himself remained without a biography. Thus, even in Liu Xiang’s time, his origins could no longer be traced. Lords Wang and Guo encountered Master Fuqiu during the *Yuankang* era of the Jin, suggesting he lingered among men as if by design, perhaps to guide later seekers.

The study of divine transcendence fundamentally traces back to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, taking non-action, emptiness of heart, and restraint of desire as its foundation, supplemented by hidden acts of virtue and the arts of alchemical refinement and qi-cultivation. In essence, only those of surpassing detachment can attain it. While dwelling among men, transcendents rarely gain renown, for they deeply guard their names as a matter of caution. Only after ascending as immortals do their extraordinary traces become manifest, revealing the path for others to follow. Such intent is beyond the grasp of those with shallow understanding or narrow vision.

The rulers of Qin and Han, though masters of the world, exhausted their armies and squandered their resources, their hearts swollen with arrogance and their spirits dissipated. Yet they sought immortality and eternal life—could such men truly transcend creation and surpass antiquity? In recent times, however, those who pursue this study have instead sought fame and profit, rushing to the gates of high officials to peddle their doctrines, sitting complacently without doubt, and claiming to have scaled Kunlun, traversed the Great Void, and wandered the ethereal realms. Those who hear of them may sit in reverent silence, not daring to question, yet fail to discern whether such individuals are truly detached from the world.

Surveying the transcendents of past ages, all were exceptional and untrammeled, shedding worldly entanglements, and embodying a profound and serene spirit. Though they did not ride the wind or mount the clouds, nor leave traces among men, they had already departed from the common path of the world. Those who cultivate such a heart may yet approach this Way.

Lord Wang is a man of noble wisdom and profound virtue, and he found these humble words worthy. Thus, I have recounted the affairs of Master Fuqiu alongside this record.

Recorded on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month in the second year of *Yuanyou*.

*Composed by Shen Tingrui, Daoist of Yunsun Mountain*

Those who study the arts of divine transcendents have all cultivated for generations, accumulating merit and amassing virtue, refining their hearts within and purifying their conduct without. Thus, in every generation, divine transcendents descend to become their masters, transmitting the supreme Dao. The fruition of the Dao extends its merit to others; when merit is complete, one ascends as an immortal. As the scriptures say: *"Through accumulated study, one becomes a Perfected Person."* This is what it means.

The Two Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain, Wang and Guo, were originally from Chenliu in Bianzhou. Wang was a distant descendant of Fangping, while Guo was Wang’s clansman. (Note: Another version states that the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, were originally from Taiyuan Ward in Chenliu County, Bianzhou, and that their distant ancestor was Fangping.) During the Han dynasty, Fangping was recommended for filial piety and appointed Gentleman, later rising to Grand Master of the Palace and Yellow Gate Attendant. His grandson, Yansi, presented *The Meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals* during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Jin after his father’s death. Their family had long been virtuous and upright, accumulating good deeds over generations.

Their mother, Lady Xu, at the age of thirty, once dreamed that moonlight filled the room and divine radiance shone upon her. Upon waking, she found herself with child and later gave birth to twin sons. Their spirits were keen and their bearing exceptional, far surpassing their peers. One was named Daoxiang, the other Daoyi. Daoxiang took the surname of the prefect, while Daoyi took the surname of the county magistrate—the prefect’s surname was Wang, and the magistrate’s was Guo.

As they grew, they took no delight in worldly affairs, yearning only to leave the household life. Their parents could not sway their resolve, firm as metal and stone, and so they drew up a petition and sent their two sons to seek a master.

The two Perfected Ones took their father’s petition and journeyed to the Xuanyuan Abbey on Tianjie Mountain in Daliang, where they paid homage to Master Fuqiu as their teacher. The master’s personal name was Liang, and he was originally from Beihai. Among his disciples during the Lower Prime Festival were two eminent ones: one surnamed Huang, named Yu, and the other surnamed Wu, named Zhi. Having inherited the Daoist teachings, they had devoted many years to their studies, diligently receiving the sacred scriptures day and night without respite. The two Perfected Ones, sharing the same aspiration, served their master in hopes of attaining liberation.

The two Perfected Ones were by nature benevolent and filial, their moral integrity lofty and pure. Their talents and wisdom surpassed all others, yet their hearts delighted in the Way of immortals. They first left the household life at the Xuanyuan Abbey in their home prefecture, becoming disciples of Master Fuqiu. Later, they followed him to Jinhua Mountain to gather herbs. There, Fuqiu entrusted the two Perfected Ones, Huang and Wu, saying: "You must cultivate with diligence and refine yourselves earnestly; soon your Way will be accomplished, and I shall transmit the dharma to you." He then taught the two Perfected Ones the arts of nurturing life. By the age of twenty-one, they practiced their daily disciplines from dawn to dusk, unwavering in their devotion. Their master praised their virtue.

One day, Fuqiu said to the two Perfected Ones: "I must depart for a time; we may not meet again soon." With these words, he suddenly vanished without a trace. The two Perfected Ones longed for their master day and night, weeping and praying to heaven, vowing to see him again to complete their Daoist practice. One evening, they dreamed of a divine being who told them: "If you journey to the three peaks at the southernmost summit, you will find him." Having received this auspicious sign, they did not shrink from the distance. Taking up their gourd and straw hat, they traveled directly to the south, traversing the grotto-heavens and abodes of immortals.

*(An alternate version states: They journeyed southward, nearing Fuzhou, passing by Bijia Mountain—now under Linchuan County—where fifty li to the northwest stands the Yongxing Abbey. They also passed through Linggu Mountain, a perilous gorge twenty-three li east of Linchuan County, rising four li and one hundred paces in height.)*

Tradition holds that the Two Perfected Ones refined elixirs within these mountains, where the Abbey of Hidden Perfection now stands. Entering Fuzhou, they paid respects to the prefect, whose surname was Ruan and given name Cheng. He received them with reverence and courtesy, personally escorting them to the city’s finest lodging, Jinghe Anxi. Today, the Abbey of Celestial Celebration stands there, formerly known as Tianbao.

One day, the Two Perfected Ones departed Fuzhou and arrived at Yutong Mountain, where they surveyed the thirty-six grotto-heavens and blessed lands among its peaks. Ascending Nine Immortals Peak, they beheld a canopy of splendor rising majestically from the earth and paid their respects. They then proceeded to Lesser Peak, where they lingered for some time. Today, before the second ridge of Baoguang Abbey on Yusun Mountain, stands the Hua Gai Pavilion, located in Xingan County of Linjiang. Passing by Hefu Mountain, they observed the Wang-Guo Altar still present before its peak, now within Qingjiang County. Continuing onward to Fucheng in Fengcheng County, they rested briefly.

The following day, they arrived at the foot of Luoshan, where an abbey once named Tongxian—later renamed Danxia—stood. The place was called Tongzao (a common corruption of which is Tongzao). Ascending Luoshan, they gazed afar at the three peaks of Hua Gai, known as Wangxian Peak. Bound for Magu, they detoured to a solitary mountain, its peaks encircling it like a screen, with a small stream flowing below. The Two Perfected Ones climbed the mountain to rest. Today, it is called Zhonghua Mountain, located twenty li east of Guangchang County in Jianchang Prefecture. They then passed through a cliff, where they dwelled for some time. Now within Nancheng County, fifty li to the east, the site is called Shiyan, housing a shrine to the Two Immortals.

Arriving at Magu Grotto, they beheld the place where their distant ancestor, Lord Fangping, once met Magu. Ascending a mountain to survey the surroundings, they suddenly saw three peaks soaring into the southern sky. The mountain they climbed is now called Xianzhu Peak, with a shrine to the Three Immortals below and the Abbey of Great Central Auspiciousness at its base. From Yusun Mountain en route to Magu, they observed a mountain with three peaks piercing the heavens. Inquiring of the local elders, they asked, “What is this mountain called?” One replied, “It is the Hua Gai Mountain of Baling.” The Two Perfected Ones remarked to each other, “This mountain is a blessed land, and its name is extraordinary. Our master’s parting words spoke of the three peaks at the southernmost summit—surely he must be there.” They bowed in reverence from afar.

*(An alternate version states: After parting from Magu, the Two Perfected Ones ascended a peak five to seven li to the west, now called Xian Mountain, five li west of Nancheng County, where a shrine to the Two Perfected Lords stands. They then departed the mountain. Lord Wang proceeded first to a bridge, where he waited for Lord Guo. Today, this is the Huiguo Bridge in Nanfeng. They then saw a mountain like a brush, its sheer cliffs soaring into the sky, and climbed to rest. A shrine to the Two Perfected Ones remains there, forty li northwest of Nanfeng County. The mountain’s verdant peaks pierce the heavens, visible from hundreds of li away. In times of great drought, prayers here invariably bring rain. During the Western Han, King Wu of Min once performed sacrifices to his armies on this mountain, hence its name, Jun Mountain. Ascending another mountain, they gazed toward Hua Gai and left behind a peach pit, where a peach tree still grows. The site, in Yihuang County, is called Cisang, also a relic of Master Fuqiu. Returning to Fuzhou, they bid farewell to the prefect and departed through the Western Ford. Gazing at a towering mountain, the Two Perfected Ones remarked, “This mountain is surely fine.” They climbed it and surveyed the landscape—waters graceful, mountains wondrous, with peaks bowing left and right. After resting briefly, they buried a measure of gold atop the mountain, declaring, “This mountain shall one day be named for this act.” Today, the Golden Stone Terrace at the Western Ford marks where the Two Perfected Ones left their gold, and the Abbey of Hidden Immortals now stands there. They then arrived at Tong Mountain, now called E’feng Mountain, where the Abbey of Dragon Spring is located. Passing through a place called Zuoqiao, they saw a mountain shrouded in clouds, resembling a yellow dragon ascending to heaven. The Two Perfected Ones climbed it and laughed, saying, “This mountain may also serve as a place for the people to cultivate blessings.” Descending and crossing a bridge, they observed the mountain’s form—a range extending from the left of Han, its ridges unbroken—until they reached Qili Mountain, where the terrain stood uniquely majestic. They remarked, “This mountain is splendid, a true place for immortals to cultivate the Dao.” Advancing five li, the mountain’s grandeur unfolded, peaks bowing left and right, waters graceful before them, like a hundred-li lineage of mountains, a thousand peaks encircling like a crouching tiger or coiled dragon. The Two Perfected Ones climbed the mountain and dwelled there.

As dusk fell, a gentle breeze arose, and the bright moon hung in the sky. Beneath the pines, the Two Perfected Ones talked and laughed, forgetting sleep. At dawn, they faced south toward the mountain’s summit, bowing in search of the three peaks of Hua Gai. As they finished their obeisance, the clouds and mist parted. Before them stood three peaks, sheer as if carved, soaring beyond the heavens. The Two Perfected Ones rejoiced, saying, “This is the mountain Magu saw—our master’s promised reunion is near!” They then carved into green stone:

*"Transcendent traces, pure as ice in a gourd,
Flourishing for ten thousand generations,
A dwelling for a thousand Perfected Ones."*

Carving complete, they buried it beneath the pines where they rested, declaring, “When we return here in the future, on the day we attain the Dao, we shall bestow blessings upon this land’s people.” To this day, the incense and offerings here flourish beyond all others. The villagers initially built three thatched huts, calling them the Pavilion of Immortal Travels. Later, an abbey was established, first named Purple Mansion, then renamed Zhaoqing Abbey. The mountain is called Xianyou. A hall was built, and a tripod for elixir refinement was unearthed. Detailed records exist in the *Xiangshan Annals*, including an inscription by Yan Lugong.

Day and night, the Two Perfected Ones wandered and rested beneath the pines, refining the Five Spirit Elixirs, saying, “We seek to replenish the true *qi* of the five viscera and enrich the essence of the Three Fields.”

Having refined the elixir, they ingested it. Entering Baling County, the magistrate received and welcomed them—his surname was Xia, his courtesy name Ziying. He escorted the Two Perfected Ones to a Daoist abbey in the western part of the county to rest, where an abbey now stands called Jade Clarity, formerly named Auspicious Clouds. The following day, a vegetarian feast and ritual were prepared. After the feast, the Two Perfected Ones briefly rested at their lodging, then together ventured into the market, seeking out village elders. Gazing toward northern Baling, they reflected on its many scenic sites. Moreover, this county’s mountains and waters were exceptionally refined, its customs pure and sincere. They remarked, “Here, figures of destiny shall emerge in due time—those who will inherit and propagate our Dao.”

They then traversed the entire jurisdiction, and wherever they went, halls for incense offerings and Daoist rituals were later established. Seeking their master, they proceeded to a place a hundred paces southwest of the county seat, where the land was somewhat level, with a small stream flowing across its front. They transformed the local residents, saying, “Here, a Daoist sanctuary should be established, with sacred images enshrined. Should calamities arise, this is where merit should be cultivated and blessings sought.” Later, the villagers built a sanctuary named the Abbey of Cultivating Virtue. Today, an abbey stands there called Cultivating Virtue, formerly named Eternal Reverence.

Proceeding several dozen paces further, they crossed a bridge and remarked, “This bridge seems to mark a significant place.” Observing the surroundings, they declared, “This land’s excellence also makes it a site for planting blessings.” Today, an abbey stands there called Non-Action, formerly named Righteous Prosperity.

Crossing the river and gazing southeast, they walked a short distance and rested upon a plain. Later, the villagers built a pavilion there called Immortal Pavilion. Today, the abbey’s plaque has been changed to Renewed Prosperity. To the left of the pavilion once stood a pine tree, several armspans in girth, said to have been planted by one of the Perfected Ones. The abbey contains an inscription by Minister Sun, recorded in the local annals.

Fifteen *li* to the southeast, they spied a place that seemed worth exploring, yet no path led there. Circling the mountain trails, they suddenly found a route and ascended. The villagers named the place This Mountain. Today, the abbey there is called Distant Mountain.

From the swift mountain path, they traveled several *li* and stayed for nine days at Crow’s Rest, where they studied scriptures and teachings. After their ascension, the villagers established an abbey called Nine Perfected’s Prospect. The images of the Three Perfected Ones were named *First Scripture Beneath the Floral Canopy*.

The Two Perfected Ones once gazed toward the northwest of the county seat, where a mountain offered a fine view, and they climbed it. In play, they gathered stones to build a pagoda, telling the villagers, “Should disasters or hardships arise, perform exorcisms here.” The villagers followed their instructions and found them efficacious. Today, an abbey stands there called Soaring Clouds, formerly named Northern Pagoda Azure Flower Mountain.

Crossing the water and traveling twenty *li* south, they ascended a slope and remarked, “This land is also fine.” Today, an abbey stands there called Summoning Splendor.

Proceeding forty *li* southeast, they wandered until nightfall. They sought lodging at the home of a recluse named Zhang, who received them with great courtesy. When asked their names and origins, they replied, “We are originally surnamed Wang and Guo, having come from Jinhua to Mount Floral Canopy to visit our master, Fuqiu.” They would say no more. Later, the recluse dedicated his residence to incense offerings, and an abbey was established called Summoning the Perfected.

Gazing southwest toward a plain, they said, “This land is suitable for cultivating jade; otherwise, planting *zhi* mushrooms in the fields will suffice.” They rested for a day before continuing on their way. Today, an abbey stands there called Jade Fields. Legend holds that Perfected Lord Wang personally planted it, hence the name Jade Fields. By the Liang dynasty, the Perfected One Xiao Ziyun first cultivated jade here, and it was renamed Jade Fields.

The Two Perfected Ones, having come from Jinhua, were accompanied by a follower surnamed Hua, named Da, who followed them throughout Jiangnan. Upon reaching Baling, at a place called Jin Village, he lost track of the Two Perfected Ones and retreated to a small mountain. Today, that mountain bears the Hua Canopy Immortal Shrine, named Mount Hua, the place where Hua Da attained immortality.

Thereupon, he sought out Mount Floral Canopy and indeed found his master. The master said, “Your resolve to cultivate the true Dao is truly unyielding. I shall teach you further the Way of refining the body and cultivating the essence.” The Two Perfected Ones practiced and persevered through cold and heat without rest.

One day, the master addressed them: “Your Dao is now nearly complete, yet without benefiting the people, your merit cannot be perfected.” Another version states, “Without serving as an official to benefit the people, how can merit be established?” He instructed them to externally master the arts of *Three-Five Flying Steps*—another version says the *Method*—and the *Nine-One Supreme Clarity* scriptures—another version says *texts*. Today, Deng Yougong’s presentation of the *Rao Cave Qi* on Mount Floral Canopy, where he obtained the stone casket of esoteric writings, refers to this. “Use these to aid the times and fulfill your merit and conduct. I shall memorialize your names to the Golden Gates and ascend to the Celestial Emperor’s presence. When your merit and conduct are complete, you shall become immortals.”

The Two Perfected Ones followed his instructions and practiced diligently. In the first year of the *Yuan Kang* reign (or the first year of the *Jing Yuan* reign, the seventh day of the seventh month), Master Fuqiu played his zither at the Jade Pavilion’s western bend on the mountain’s north side. Suddenly, auspicious clouds and mist filled the valley and connected with the sky, while celestial music resounded and magnificent processions gathered in the clouds. A crimson-robed figure delivered a message: “The Celestial Emperor decrees that Master Fuqiu shall ascend first. Before doing so, he entrusts these subtle and wondrous teachings to the Two Perfected Ones.” Master Fuqiu then mounted a dragon chariot and soared into the heavens, while the Two Perfected Ones bowed in farewell.

They continued their cultivation at their hermitage, often exhaling clouds to form a bridge, crossing to the mountain’s summit to pay homage to the Dipper and face the heavens. At that place, they established the Two Immortals’ Altars. Thus, the abbey was named Bridge Immortal, later renamed Revering Immortals.

Thereafter, their mastery of the immortal arts grew ever more precise. They could walk on stones, dispatch talismans through the air, and summon clouds to bring rain. When people from near and far suffered illness or urgent hardships, they would come to petition them, and the Perfected Ones would send talismans to save them. In times of drought, when prayers were offered, they would summon rain to relieve the people. Their deeds in rescuing from disaster and delivering from hardship are too numerous to recount.

Later, they refined the Great Elixir. Upon its completion, their divine radiance and spiritual brilliance illuminated the heavens.

At that time, the celestial officials in charge of heavenly phenomena found this strange and reported to the reigning sovereign: "In the region south of the Yangtze, an auspicious qi rises to the heavens—this is the qi of a Heaven-bestowed one." The ruler commanded his ministers to deliberate in court, but none understood its meaning. Thereupon, he ordered generals to dispatch troops across the river to investigate.

The commanding general was Li Yuanya. Upon receiving the mandate, Yuanya led his forces to suppress and subdue. When they arrived at the foot of Huagai Mountain, they saw only purple clouds and auspicious qi swirling around its circumference. He ordered his soldiers to observe from afar. The Two Perfected Ones, hearing of this, laughed and said: "We cultivate the Way in emptiness and formlessness—how could we seek anything from above?" Then they transformed into immortal soldiers, filling the clouds, and engaged in playful battle with the mortal troops. Though they clashed repeatedly, no harm came to either side. When the soldiers shot arrows, the arrowheads fell to the ground and turned into shards of tile. The troops grew fearful and hesitant. To this day, the place is called Battle Plain, and the Horse Hoof Stone remains. Even now, farmers occasionally harvest arrowheads made of tile.

Suddenly, black clouds gathered from all directions, plunging the land into darkness. The generals and soldiers trembled, unable to advance or retreat. Only then did Yuanya and his men realize they were in the presence of divine immortals. They kowtowed, begged forgiveness, and vowed never again to disturb the true sages. In an instant, the clouds rolled back, revealing a radiant, auspicious light. Soon after, a precious bow of cassia wood descended from the sky, its luminous splendor unlike anything in the world. Yuanya received the bow and sent envoys to present it to the court, recounting all that had transpired.

The emperor, astonished upon seeing it, commanded his officials to examine it. Only the prime minister, Li Zhongfu, memorialized: "This is the bow with which the heavenly immortals play—it is surely a response to Your Majesty’s sagely virtue. The realm possesses transcendent beings and has now obtained this wondrous treasure." The hundred officials offered their congratulations and urged the emperor to order Yuanya to withdraw his troops. He then dispatched envoys to summon the Two Perfected Ones.

The Two Perfected Ones declined, saying: "We dwell in these mountains to bring blessings to the people." They firmly refused the imperial summons.

(Another version states: After the envoys returned and reported, the emperor issued another decree, dispatching the official Li Zhongde, along with Prefect Liu Pinghui of Fuzhou, Magistrate Huang Sihu of Linchuan, and Magistrate Xia Ziying of Baling, to Huagai Mountain to offer thanks.)

In the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin, they ascended to immortality. On the first day of the second month in the third year of the Yuankang era, the Two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo, were at Yuting Pavilion north of the mountain, where they received the Jade Emperor’s decree to ascend. Before departing, they left these words for the villagers: "After we leave, if you encounter plagues of insects, droughts or floods, illness, hardship, or difficulties in bearing descendants, pray to us here, and we shall respond with blessings. If you remain loyal and filial to your sovereign and parents, maintain an upright heart, aid the poor, and relieve the distressed—doing so to the best of your ability—this is the greatest merit. But those who are disloyal, unfilial, unjust, unkind, envious, or deceitful—even if they exhaust their wealth, shave their heads, or burn their bodies in supplication—if they do not first reform, we shall never respond."

Having spoken, Wang mounted a green luan, and Guo rode a white crane. Immortal musicians and attendants led the way, while rainbow banners and divine officials followed behind. Slowly, they ascended. From the hour of *chen* to *si*, the auspicious clouds and rosy hues lingered in the sky until they vanished from sight. The full account was reported, and an imperial edict decreed: all places where the Two Perfected Ones had traversed were to be honored with abbeys.

To the east of the mountain, Xianlin Abbey was built; to the south, Nanzhen Abbey; at Yuting Pavilion north of the mountain, Shangxian Abbey; and at the site where the Two Perfected Ones had cultivated the Dao, where they exhaled qi to form a bridge and walked to the summit to pay homage to the Dipper, Bridge Immortal Abbey was established. In the eighth year of the Xining era, it was renamed Revering Immortals Abbey by imperial decree.

Before the abbey stands a mountain resembling a flying dragon ascending to heaven—this was where Master Fuqiu often resided, and it is called Fuqiu Altar. The place where the immortal bow descended is called Bow Mountain. The site of the battle between immortal and mortal soldiers is named Battle Plain. The spot where immortal maidens played music during the Two Perfected Ones’ ascension is called Immortal Maiden Peak. The place where they paid homage to the Dipper is called Immortal Altar—all are ancient sites.

After their ascension, the Jade Emperor dispatched thirty-six immortal officials and eighteen pure earth deities to guard the places where the Two Perfected Ones had resided, preventing any defilement. Later, sites such as Purple Mystery Cave, Five Peaks Altar, Dismounting Platform, Goose Amber, Deer Head Mountain, Blood Wood Hollow, Tea-Boiling Hollow, Ox Head Hollow, Twilight Peak, Pure Water Pool, Dragon-Throwing Pool, and Incense Burner Peak also became sacred traces, along with the abbeys they established.

From then on, whenever the prefecture or county suffered famine, insect plagues, personal calamities, or misfortune, the people would come to the altar to pray, and their pleas were never left unanswered. Thus, people from all directions, undeterred by distance, came to seek their blessings.

Having long heard of these auspicious events yet lacking knowledge of their full origins, I sought out ancient traces and surviving inscriptions, obtaining this veritable record. The immortal trails stand revealed as if fully preserved of old; I set them down here to inform those who come after.

**Imperial Edict Conferring Titles upon the Two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo**

*Memorandum from the Central Secretariat:*
By decree of the Central Secretariat: Wherever numinous spirits reside, the people indeed rely upon their sheltering grace. When beneficent influence is manifest, how could We forget to honor and exalt them?

The Perfected Ones Wang and Guo of Shangxian Abbey in Fuzhou—lofty their immortal bearing, resplendent their bestowed virtue. Dwelling humbly upon the renowned mountain of Huagai, they profoundly attained the wondrous Dao of Fuqiu. From one region they draw reverent pilgrims, none too distant to arrive; from a thousand leagues they receive supplications, answered wherever sincerity is found. Thus We now confer celestial titles to acclaim their hidden merit in aiding all beings.

Perfected One Wang shall be styled **Chongying True Lord**; Perfected One Guo shall be styled **Chengying True Lord**. May those in distant lands forever receive the blessings of peace and deliverance.

Let this edict be made known as fitting.

Memorial received in accordance with the aforementioned imperial edict. By order of the imperial edict, this memorial is hereby issued. Dated the ___ day of the seventh month, the eighth year of the Xining reign.

Lu, Grand Master for Court Audiences and Participant in Determining Governmental Matters; Wang, Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites and Participant in Determining Governmental Matters; Han, Vice Director of the Ministry of Personnel and Grand Councilor; Wang, Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs and concurrently Vice Director of the Chancellery and Grand Councilor.

Memorial from the Emperor Shenzong renaming Qiaoxian Abbey as Chongxian Abbey.

From the Chancellery and the Department of State Affairs, a memorial to Chongxian Abbey:

Fuzhou Prefecture memorializes, citing a report from the magistrate of Chongren County, Guo Jun, that in accordance with the prefectural dispatch, two edicts of exhortation were delivered, conferring upon Perfected One Wang of Huagai Mountain the title **Chongying True Lord**, and upon Perfected One Guo the title **Chengying True Lord**. An emissary was dispatched to perform the ritual announcement, and plaques were to be crafted and installed at Shangxian Abbey. The emissary personally oversaw the conveyance and proceeded to make the ritual announcement. As there was no abbey hall at Shangxian, the edicts of exhortation were temporarily entrusted to Qiaoxian Abbey for safekeeping.

Upon investigation, it was found that at the foot of this mountain, there originally stood four abbeys: Xianlin, Nanzhen, Qiaoxian, and Shangxian. Of these, Xianlin, Nanzhen, and Shangxian abbeys had no abbey halls, leaving only Qiaoxian Abbey extant. The two edicts of exhortation bestowed by the court are currently entrusted to Qiaoxian Abbey for safekeeping. The aforementioned ancient abbey, originally without a formal plaque, has relied on recorded accounts for its offerings. It is now petitioned that a formal plaque be granted to sustain the Daoist community in residence, permitting them to maintain the rites and vigilantly safeguard the edicts, thereby fulfilling the prayers and supplications.

The prefectural authorities, based on the official’s report, note that the court has bestowed upon Perfected One Wang of Huagai Mountain the title **Chongying True Lord**, and upon Perfected One Guo the title **Chengying True Lord**, with plaques to be crafted and installed at Shangxian Abbey. Recent investigations reveal that the abbeys at the foot of this mountain, including Shangxian Abbey, have long since fallen into ruin, their lands wholly reverted to the state. No reconstruction could be undertaken without authorization. Only the nearby Qiaoxian Abbey has retained its ancestral halls and revered images, though it lacks a formal name or plaque. Originally possessing over six hundred *mu* of paddy fields, these too were confiscated by the state. With no successors to inherit, the mountain has seen only a single Daoist priest from this county maintaining the rites and supplications, as has been the custom.

Now that the edicts conferring the titles **Chongying True Lord** and **Chengying True Lord** have been received, they are to be kept and safeguarded at this site. The prefectural authorities petition that the surviving abbey be designated as Shangxian Abbey, with a special imperial mandate to bestow a formal name, restoring it as of old. The revered images and over six hundred *mu* of paddy fields are to be reinstated, and a Daoist priest of virtuous conduct selected to maintain the rites, perform supplications, and oversee the abbey in perpetuity. The edicts of exhortation are to be safeguarded pending further imperial instructions. In accordance with the memorial, it is fitting to specially bestow the plaque **Chongxian Abbey**. By order of the edict, this memorial is hereby issued.

Emperor Zhezong bestowed upon Master Fuqiu the title "Transcendent Lord of Supernal Response." In the second year of the Yuanyou reign, the Jiangxi Circuit Transport Commission memorialized to request an honorific title for Master Fuqiu. By imperial edict dated the eighth day of the eighth month of the third year of Yuanyou:

The Dao is originally without intent, yet its subtlety elicits response.
The resonance of spirit arises from the profound and obscure.
How splendid are the Three Immortals, whose blessings extend to the entire realm.
Reviving the withered and flowing through the valleys, they repeatedly bestow abundant harvests.
Having already exalted the honorific of *Huagai*, it is fitting to manifest the teachings of Fuqiu.
Elevating him with a transcendent title shall duly console the sentiments of the people.
Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Transcendent of Supernal Response*.

Dated the sixteenth day of the ninth month, the third year of Yuanyou.
Wang Huan, Gentleman for Court Service and Provisional Vice Transport Commissioner of Jiangnan West Circuit, wearing the purple.

Emperor Huizong issued an edict to enfeoff Transcendent Fuqiu with the title *Precious Revelation*. By imperial decree dated the ninth day of the eighth month of the seventh year of Zhenghe:

Expounding the profound and subtle principles of the Great Beginning, he benevolently bestows favor upon the myriad regions. Having broadly summoned reclusive scholars from mountains and forests to inspire later learners, he further venerates and exalts those of ancient virtue from remote antiquity, thereby manifesting the sincere intent of reverence. This augments the blessings of the realm.

The *Transcendent of Supernal Response* of Chongxian Abbey in Chongren County, Fuzhou, has delved into the mysteries and mastered transformation, exhausting the divine. Soaring through the Great Void, he is revered by later generations. With a mind to further honor him, We enhance his illustrious name, bestowing upon him a laudatory inscription to convey Our utmost regard.
Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord Fuqiu*.

Dated the ninth day of the eighth month, the seventh year of Zhenghe. By imperial edict as above. Upon receipt of the edict, let it be implemented.
Proclamation to Perfected Lord Fuqiu: By imperial edict as above. Upon receipt of the talisman, let it be implemented.

Dated the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the seventh year of Zhenghe.

Emperor Lizong added the titles *Perfected Lord of Trusted Protection*, *Perfected Lord of Right Protection*, and *Perfected Lord of Manifest Protection*. By imperial mandate dated the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month of the Dingyou year of the Jiaxi reign:

The *Precious Canopy* is the loftiest peak of Jiangnan, as recorded by Yan Zhenqing of the Tang. Chongxian Abbey on Huagai Mountain in Chongren County, Fuzhou, where Perfected Lord Fuqiu and others have resided, has seen their numinous efficacy grow ever more manifest in recent years. They defend the people and repel bandits, soaring like clouds in the distance; they cure illnesses with water and jade, driving away plagues from the eastern mountains. It is fitting to augment their honorific titles to requite their great blessings.

Moreover, it is heard that the farming populace particularly dreads the scourge of drought. Let the local sayings be examined to avoid disrespect toward the deities.
In accordance with the foregoing, let them be specially enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Trusted Protection Fuqiu*, *Perfected Lord of Right Protection Chongying*, and *Perfected Lord of Manifest Protection Chengying*.

Dated the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month, the first year of the Jiaxi reign.
*Records of the Deeds of the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain: Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo, Volume Two* concludes here.
*Records of the Deeds of the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain: Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo, Volume Three*.

Daoist Zhang Yuanshu compiled the *Records of Huagai Mountain*.
According to the records, Huagai Mountain stands between the borders of Linchuan and Luling, belonging to Chongren in Fuzhou on the maps. The mountain rises thirty-five *li* in height and spans over four hundred *li* in circumference. At its heart lies the Grotto of Purple Mystery, where Perfected Lord Fuqiu and the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, cultivated the Dao and ascended to transcendence. This is the *Baogai Mountain* recorded in the *Hua-Yi Map*.

It is further noted that in Yongjia County, Wenzhou, there is also a Huagai Mountain, whose grotto spans four hundred *li* and is named the Heaven of *Rongcheng* and *Taiyu*. Master Chongmiao, Li Sicong, wrote a poem about it:
*A mountain like a canopy, its form lofty and grand,*
*Its rosy clouds discern the ice cliffs, where dark verdure runs deep.*
*Towering through the layered skies for hundreds of li,*
*A thousand peaks surge wildly, as if the four seas converge.*
*Phosphorescent light bursts from the Three Lives Stone,*
*Ancient emerald gleams on the Five-Grain Pine.*
*Beyond the vermilion halls of the Jade Emperor’s shrine,*
*Distant altars dip in flowers, where waters flow clear and bright.*

It is also noted that in Yuhang County, Hangzhou, there is a Zigai Mountain, which contains the Grotto of Purple Mystery. The immortals who attained the Dao there are not recorded in detail. Only the Huagai of Chongren has grown increasingly renowned for its numinous efficacy since the Jin dynasty. Prayers from prefectures and counties have never failed to receive response. There are the stele of Duke Yan [Yan Zhenqing] and the *Veritable Records of Immortal Shen*, which provide exhaustive accounts.

During the Xining reign of the Song, the local prefects and magistrates memorialized the stele inscriptions to the court, and the mountain was specially bestowed with a precious title. As for the sites where the Three Perfected manifested their transformations, their number is beyond reckoning. The peaks and crags of our own region may still be thoroughly investigated, but the traces in distant lands are difficult to exhaustively seek out.

Since donning the Daoist robe, I have inquired of venerable elders and learned the details, now over a dozen years past. Ever mindful of the traces of the Three Perfected yet lacking a complete account of their deeds, I have now, by the grace of Heaven, encountered the full text, supplemented by the annotations of Master Li Gongyan, all of which are well-documented. As the years lengthen, the incense offerings grow ever more abundant. Some structures may have been built after the liberation of Master Shen, yet remain unrecorded in the annals, leaving later generations with no means to study them. Thus, I, Yuanshu, though unworthy and foolish, have broadly sought out and gathered all that I have witnessed or heard, recording it in full to compile this record. My aim is to propagate the true Daoist teachings, reverently uphold the sagely transformation, and enable scholars from all directions to perform rites of exorcism and supplication, each honoring the Perfected in accordance with their locale. It is hoped that blessings will follow their wishes, and no sincere prayer will go unanswered—this is what is meant by "the Dao is near, and need not be sought afar."

If one can follow the legacy of the Two Perfected, cultivating uprightness, loyalty, and filial piety, aiding the poor and rescuing the distressed, and practicing these virtues to the best of one’s ability, responses will swiftly manifest.

Herein are recorded the scenic traces of Huagai, along with the sites where the Three Perfected have manifested their responses across the land—all grotto heavens and blessed lands, abbeys and peaks, as well as the establishment of altars and ritual grounds, all of which are duly chronicled below.

The Purple Mystery Grotto is the abode where the Three Perfected Lords—Master Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo—once dwelled. The Court of Merit and Demerit, as recorded in the *Illustrated Register of Divine Immortals*, lies beneath the first peak, nestled within a sheer cliff a thousand fathoms high. The grotto’s entrance faces the land of the Three Yangs, mirroring the form of the Eight Trigrams. Above and below, it hangs in isolation; to the east and west, cliffs stand like walls. Beside the grotto grow stone hair and stone ears, rare flowers and exotic grasses, monstrous rocks and colossal boulders—all beyond description. Only from the altar where the Three Perfected ascended can these wonders be glimpsed from afar. Amidst towering green crags, two stone doors loom faintly. Azure mushrooms and verdant bamboo cluster upon the grotto’s rocks; white clouds and purple mists gather around its mounds. Within, it harbors golden radiance and jade hues, storing and releasing wind and thunder. For here, the Supreme Numinous One reviews the registers within, and it is the very sanctuary where immortals reside.

Through the ages, adepts have risked their lives to scale its verdant cliffs, clutching vines and treading grasses like gibbons—yet from afar, onlookers’ hearts shatter with dread. From dawn to dusk, as they near the grotto’s entrance, mere yards away, an extraordinary wind pierces their bones, cold as ice and snow, barring further advance. Thus, the grotto’s bounds are as impassable as Kunlun or Penglai: its summit broadens while its base narrows, offering no path to ascend—one can only stretch out a hand, bow the head, and turn back. Alas! Such transcendent realms of immortals and sages are not for those whose bodies cannot lightly rise—how could one reach them carelessly?

The Thunder Grotto lies on the northern face of the first peak, suspended in emptiness and sheer isolation. From all surrounding mountains, it is visible yet utterly inaccessible. When the sky is about to clear after rain, a single wisp of cloud ascends from the Thunder Grotto like flying smoke. In an instant, it swells into dense obscurity, and wind and rain sweep across the eight directions; thunder and lightning clash in swift succession. Such divine transformations are wondrous beyond comprehension.

According to the *Clarified Regulations of the Supreme Mystery Immortal Ranks Sutra*, the Three Perfected Immortal Lords—Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo—preside over the life and death, sins and blessings, harvests and famines, floods and droughts of the people in the Wu and Chu regions. Thus, they command thirty-six immortal officials, various thunder deities, and legions of soldiers, each fulfilling their duties. Once, a sculptor named Li descended from the mountain and, midway down, suddenly saw black clouds surging, within which thunder rumbled faintly. As they drew nearer, a thunderclap resounded, and from the clouds emerged thunder gods—all green-bodied, wielding axes and driving chariots. Three times this vision appeared; his soul scattered in terror, and he collapsed to the ground. Upon reaching the mountain’s base, he found torrential rain falling, though atop the peak, the sun shone and not a wisp of cloud remained. Today, Thunder Duke Ridge by the Ma Creek is also a place where the Two Perfected command thunder.

The Tea-Boiling Hollow is where the Three Perfected—Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo—once brewed tea, and the name endures to this day. The Blood Tree Hollow is where the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, dispatched their officers to bind and execute malevolent spirits; blood spurted upon the trees, hence the name. It lies seven *li* from the main altar.

The Platforms:
- **Dismounting Platform**: Where Perfected Lord Fuqiu dismounted before ascending his altar.
- **Chess Platform**: Where the Two Perfected played chess.
- **Scripture-Turning Platform**: Where the Two Perfected read scriptures.

The Ridges:
- **Retreat Heart Ridge**: Midway up the waist of Huagai’s mountains, a ridge stretches across. The higher one climbs, the steeper it becomes. Pilgrims who come to pay homage, unless their resolve is steadfast, often falter in heart here—hence the name.
- **Sword’s Edge Ridge**: Situated between the three peaks, with ten-thousand-fathom precipices on either side. Only a single path remains, and travelers cannot help but tremble, as if treading the edge of a blade. Yet if one wholeheartedly invokes the names of the Three Perfected, praying for their protection, the path feels as level as flat ground, the heart calm and the spirit settled, with no sense of peril.
- **Drum-Beating Ridge**: Where Li Yuanyan once kept time with watchtowers, hence the name. It is also said to be where drums were struck to aid in battle, two *li* from Chongxian Abbey.
- **Hua Da Ridge**: Named after Hua Da, a servant who followed the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, and attained the Dao. He paid homage here, and the ridge was thus named—later corrupted to "Painting Tree Ridge." It lies thirty *li* from Chongxian Abbey.

The Ravines:
- **Pure Water Ravine**: Where those who pay homage to the Perfected purify themselves and wash away filth.
- **Halt Horse Ravine**: Where Lord Fuqiu halted his horse before ascending the altar.
- **Jar Ravine**: A gourd-shaped ravine where the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, washed their alms bowls.
- **Night Halt Ravine**: Where Li Yuanyan stationed his troops for the night.
- **Grain-Receiving Ravine**: Where Yuanyan’s troops passed through, and prefectures and counties supplied provisions, depositing grain here.

The Altars:
- **Fuqiu Altar**: Where Fuqiu once dwelled; the cinnabar well still remains.
- **Wang Qiao Altar**: Where Prince Wang Zijin paid homage to his master Fuqiu.
- **Robing Altar**: Where the Two Perfected donned their robes to meet their master.
- **Five Peaks Altar**: Where the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks convened to deliberate human sins and blessings.
- **Wang-Guo Altar**: Where the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, gazed toward Hezao; it is recorded in the *Map of Chongzhen Abbey*.
- **Ascension Altar**: Located behind the Stone Hall of Immortal King Peak in Danxia Grotto of Maji Mountain in Jianchang. According to ancient tradition, it is where Wang Bao, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness and disciple of Lord Fuqiu, ascended. Each spring and summer, insects shaped like flies enter the altar’s masonry, preventing harm to crops. In autumn, they shed their shells and depart. The efficacy is extraordinary, and this continues to this day.

The Crags.

**Hidden Immortal Crag** lies on the sunlit side of the First Peak, sheer and perilous, seldom trodden by human feet. Those who scale its heights by clambering up the cliffs find their hair standing on end. Upon arrival, they behold grottoes veiled in mist and layered cliffs aglow with light. Legend tells of an immortal who once dwelled here in seclusion, though the passage of years has erased all trace of their tale.

**Golden Parrot Crag** is where Lord Fuqiu reared his immortal fowl. Their feathers shimmered like gold, and in years of great harvest, the golden parrots would appear; otherwise, they remained hidden. Recently, woodcutters have occasionally found golden parrot droppings at the crag’s mouth, hardened like stone.

**Tortoise and Phoenix Crag**, located in Chongren at a place called Hushi Mabei, lies twenty-four *du* south of Chang’an Township in the county’s due south. The crag is vast and luminous, housing statues of the Three Immortals beneath a canopy, along with stone gates. Those who seek blessings gather here in all seasons, and every prayer and supplication is met with manifest response.

**Ritual Stone Crag** features a rounded stone peak, its form teetering as if about to topple, resembling the eaves of a lofty roof or the posture of one paying homage to the Dipper in the heavens. Its transverse span exceeds thirty *zhang*, with space at its center for a person to stand and gaze upward. At its highest point stands the Canopy Immortal Pavilion, and to the north lies a spring nestled in a hollow, its waters ever-clear and unfailing. The locals call it "Wrapped Stone."

**Flower Immortal Crag**, situated three *li* north of Yihuang County in the Second *Du* of Immortal Cassia Township, arches like a bridge—hence its alternate name, Bridge Immortal Crag. Below it stands Yuanbao Abbey, where the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, once wandered in search of their master. The crag rises over twenty *zhang* in height, extends four to five *zhang* in depth, and spans more than ten *zhang* in breadth.

**Immortal’s Crag**, located fifty *li* from Nancheng County in Jianchang, houses a shrine to the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, marking a site they traversed. Some say an immortal’s discarded bones were once concealed here, and to this day, the place remains wondrously efficacious.

**Crouching Tiger Crag**, also in Jianchang and fifty *li* from Nancheng County, is where the Two Perfected, Wang and Guo, rode a tiger past this spot, leaving its name enduring. The villagers later built an abbey to venerate the immortal shrine, and the mountain is also called Tiger Crag.

**Cinnabar Well**
**Fuqiu’s Cinnabar Well** lies before the Immortal Hall of Yuting Abbey on the mountain’s western side. Its waters neither dry in winter nor overflow in summer, for the lingering grace of the immortal perfected remains here. Yuting Abbey was once Yuting Lodge, where Lord Fuqiu tuned his zither, and where the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, successively cultivated and ascended. Immortal Bridge Mountain stretches before it, while Immortal Maiden Peak stands to its left—truly a dwelling of divine immortals. To this day, the Cinnabar Well remains intact, often emanating auspicious light.

By the end of the Song, the abbey’s halls had fallen into ruin, and those who tended its incense regarded it as a mere waystation. In the *yichou* year of the Xianchun era (1265), Zhang Xiyi, a presented scholar styled Green Peak; Zhang Yanfa, styled Pure Kettle; and Zhang Pusheng, styled Cloudy Gorge, invited Daoist Wu Haosheng of the Void and Tranquility Abbey in Gexi to restore the dilapidated site. They provided water to aid the people, and all who sought their help found their prayers answered. The Zhang brothers, styled Heaven’s Window, recognizing that such numinous traces must not fade into obscurity, contributed their efforts to construct a new Dharma Hall. They also exhorted the faithful to rebuild the Immortal Hall and its gates, reviving the incense offerings from that time onward.

When Xiao Bingyai of Jinjing tasted this water, he composed a poem:
*Of the immortals’ old lodge, the courtyard was jade,*
*On the mountain’s peak at midday, the pipes and cranes cried.*
*I come to drink this water from the Cinnabar Well,*
*To wash my eyes that read—may they grow bright.*

· **Scenery**

The Jade Courtyard Bend, where Fuqiu tuned his zither and Wang and Guo listened in reverence. Later, after Fuqiu ascended in a gust of wind, the two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo, also ascended from this very place—hence its present name, Jade Courtyard Abbey.

Parrot-Cry Mountain, where Li Yuanyan led his troops at dawn and heard parrots calling upon arrival, thus the name.

Horse Soldier Camp, where Yuanyan stationed his cavalry, near the old battlefield.

Hundred Deer Spring, where the Perfected Lord Fuqiu made his abode, and a hundred deer grew tame around him—hence the name. It lies close to the Jade Courtyard Lodge.

Bow Mountain, where after the battle between the immortal soldiers of the Two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo, and Li Yuanyan’s mortal troops, a cassia-wood bow fell from the clouds onto this mountain. The name endures to this day. The land abounds in bowstring vines, remnants of that time.

Goose Lord Amber, where celestial geese spread their wings. Today, the Celestial Goose Pond at the Invocation of Perfection Abbey remains a site of manifest traces.

Umbrella-Snatching Cavern, where those who came to pay homage to the immortals often had their umbrellas snatched away by fierce winds.

Ink-Grinding Tortoise, somewhat distant from the Venerating Immortals Abbey and near Tortoise Peak, where the Perfected Ones once ground ink.

Cinnabar Well, beside the Second Peak, its water fragrant, pure, and sweet. Those dwelling on the mountain rely on it for drink. Each year, during the month of ascension, celestial crane flowers bloom nearby.

Tea-Boiling Spring, at the foot of the Third Peak, where the Two Perfected Ones once drew water to brew tea.

**Marvels**

Tile Arrows: The arrows shot by Li Yuanyan’s mortal soldiers, transformed by the Two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo, all turned to tiles upon falling to the ground. Such tiles remain in that place to this day, and some are still found.

Auspicious Brazier: A naturally occurring object atop the Three Peaks, inverted in three layers, its form ancient. It wards off pestilence, hence the name *Auspicious Brazier*. Those who pray with utmost sincerity may dig anywhere and find one; otherwise, they may search all day in vain. From the Jin dynasty to the present, though countless years have passed, the Auspicious Braziers respond ever more abundantly to those who dig, never exhausted. Round, even, firm, and smooth, they seem as if crafted by kiln and fire—such is the numinous transformation of the sacred.

Crossing Plank: Where Wang and Guo crossed the river by laying a log across it. The tree remains to this day, and the place is called *Crossing Plank* or *Crossbeam*, belonging to Chongren Township.

Cinnabar: On Sacred Treasure Mountain, the Two Perfected Lords, Wang and Guo, scattered cinnabar upon the summit, which all turned to stone—round and radiant as cinnabar itself, also called *Medicine Pellets*.

Stone Armor: The armor and weapons of Li Yuanyan’s mortal soldiers, transformed by the Two Perfected Ones into tiles, rendering their valor useless. Some old monks below the mountain have collected these.

Stone Hair: Growing abundantly above and below the Purple Mystery Cavern, fine as hair, it can be cooked as a vegetable. It is also said that if boiled with meat, it dissolves into water. Also called *Wang-Guo Thread*.

Horse Tracks: On the very battlefield where Li Yuanyan fought, the hoofprints of horses and mules remain imprinted in the stone to this day.

Tiger Track Stone: Near the Upper Immortals Abbey, where the Two Perfected Ones, Wang and Guo, once rode tigers and rested briefly. The tracks remain, and the stone is also called *Tiger Track Stone*, located by the roadside near Chongren River Pavilion.

**Auspicious Omens**

Golden Lamps: Appearing on clear nights, visible only when the sky is bright, the mountain cold, and the wind still.

At first, there appear thirty to fifty specks of light, which scatter into a hundred or two, then merge and disperse again—fewer, then more—until in an instant, they multiply into tens of thousands, rising and falling in succession, their star-like lamps shimmering in misty radiance.

**Golden Boats**: They drift like stars in motion, like dawn or dusk clouds, or a wisp of flying smoke—swift as lightning, fleet as a galloping steed—ever-changing in form, now hidden, now revealed.

**Circular Radiance**: Round as a chariot wheel, sometimes large, sometimes small, it appears above the Purple Mystery Cavern, its five-colored brilliance dazzling the eye. During the years of celestial ascension or on auspicious days, Perfected Immortals descend and manifest within it—sometimes one, sometimes three—all who witness them receive blessings.

**Immortal Cranes**: Occasionally seen in flight. Local elders say that in ancient times, cranes appeared frequently, with three being the largest and pure white, while the smaller ones numbered in the hundreds—sometimes one or two hundred. This was especially so at the founding of the Song dynasty, but in recent years, only three have been seen.

**Lingzhi**: Tradition holds that within the Three Peaks grow purple lingzhi, jade lingzhi, golden blossom herbs, Supreme Clarity grasses, immortal trees, and sacred lingzhi—all encountered by those who attain the Dao in these mountains.

**Immortal Medicines**: The herbs and trees of the Three Peaks have cured countless ailments when prayed over and consumed by the afflicted.

**Morning Audience Vision**: In the eighth month of the Shaoxing era of the Song, on the last day of the lunar cycle, the Daoist devotee Zeng Yantong journeyed to the mountain to pay homage. Upon reaching the Second Peak at noon, a propitious light suddenly filled the sky. A great wheel of cinnabar radiance rose directly before him, emitting five-colored golden light. Within the radiance appeared a sacred figure, clad in the robes of the Supreme Clarity, holding a tablet and facing heaven. At that moment, his companion Xie Youcheng also witnessed it. The local elders called it the *Morning Audience Vision*, a rare spectacle appearing only once in many years.

**Dragon-Submerging Pool**: Located below the Purple Mystery Cavern, where the imperial court once dispatched envoys to cast golden dragons and jade tablets as offerings. The pool is unfathomably deep, and villagers often perform rituals here to pray for rain, calling it *Striking the Dragon Pool*.

**Hidden Book Spring**: Situated beneath the Purple Mystery Cavern, along a sheer cliff a thousand *zhang* high. A woodcutter once accidentally entered it and returned with several scrolls of golden scriptures. That night, he dreamed of three Daoists coming to retrieve them, and the next day, he returned all but one. When he later tried to retrace his steps, the path was lost. To this day, the book remains, though its characters are unrecognizable. In times of drought, the local communities carry it in procession to pray for rain, and their pleas are swiftly answered. It lies near the Jade Court Abbey.

**Great Rain Cauldron**: Commonly called the *Yellow Water Bucket*. Originally emerging from the mountain’s depths, whenever villages carry it in procession to pray for rain, their prayers are immediately answered. It is said to be the cauldron of the Two Perfected Ones, though some claim it was later taken by the Celestial Officials and is no longer present.

**Flowing Pearl Pit**: Located north of this mountain, where the Two Perfected Ones once cast pearls to amuse the dragons. To this day, there remains a *Pearl Pool* and a *Pearl Pit*, near the mountain’s base.

**Divine Script on Stone Cliff**: Found above the Purple Mystery Cavern. Once, an aspirant wandering the Hidden Immortal Crag passed a great boulder and found a path leading to a sheer cliff inscribed with luminous script—its strokes vigorous, its radiance resplendent. He marked the spot with a small stone and returned. When his fellow seekers chose an auspicious day to revisit, the sky was clear at noon when suddenly thunder roared, a fierce wind arose, and rain lashed the cliffs, hurling stones and sand. The great boulder was shattered, and the script was never seen again—yet the *Divine Script* was preserved in the world.

This script, distributed by the mountain’s Daoists, wards off all evil, cures a hundred ailments, and dispels demonic influences and plagues. Wherever it is kept, divine beings offer protection.

**Gathering Pest Insects**: Every year, after planting, all insects that harm crops and creatures are gathered into the caves and crevices around the mountain, piling up like balls in the halls of the *Responsive Daoist Abbey*, beyond counting. The mountain’s residents say that if the *fragrant insects* are not shown, they swarm and harass people, impossible to drive away—only when the harvest is complete are they allowed to disperse.

**Master Mao’s Hut**: Located on the southern slope of the Second Peak, where only its foundation remains, along with a mortar for grinding medicine.

**The Twelve Peaks**

**Floating Hill Peak**: The summit of the *Hua Gai* Mountain, a blessed land of Jiangnan, known as the *Main Altar*, corresponding to the position of Perfected Lord Floating Hill.

**Perfected Wang Peak**: Corresponding to Perfected Lord Wang.

**Green Bamboo Peak**: Where Perfected Lords Wang and Guo planted green bamboo.

**Immortal-Resting Peak**: Located in *Xietian*, atop which stands the Hall of the Three Immortals.

**Gathering Immortals Peak**: Located in *Kuzhu*, its summit covered in arrowhead-like stones, lustrous and lovely. A sacred spring flows from its base, never drying in winter or summer.

**White Silver Peak**: Located in *Wugui Plain*.

**Daoist Ridge Peak**: In the thirty-eighth district of Chongren Township, where the Shrine of the Three Immortals stands.

**Pomegranate Peak**: In the fifty-first district of Chongren Township, where the Two Immortals once left pomegranates. It lies north of the *Xiankou Abbey*.

**The Thirty-Six Blessed Lands**

Tianjie Mountain’s *Mystic Origin Abbey*, Bozhou’s *Golden Flower Mountain*, *Writing Brush Mountain’s* *Eternal Prosperity Abbey*, *Jade Bamboo Shoot Mountain’s* *Hua Gai Pavilion*, Fuzhou’s *Celestial Celebration Abbey* (now *Mystic Wonder Abbey*), *Spirit Valley Mountain’s* *Hidden Perfection Abbey*, *Yuezao Mountain’s* *Wang-Guo Altar*, *Tongzao Mountain’s* *Cinnabar Radiance Abbey*, *Lu Mountain’s* *Gazing Immortal Abbey*, *Guangchang’s* *Central China Mountain*, *Jianchang Prefecture’s* *Maiden Cave*, *Immortal King Peak’s* *Auspicious Sign Abbey*, *Nanfeng County’s* *Meeting Guo Bridge*, *Nanfeng County’s* *Military Mountain*, *Immortal Crag Mountain’s* *Primordial Treasure Abbey*, *Golden Stone Terrace’s* *Immortal Seclusion Abbey*, *Goose Peak Mountain’s* *Dragon Spring Abbey*, *Immortal Journey Mountain’s* *Luminous Clarity Abbey*, *Auspicious Cloud’s* *Jade Clarity Abbey*, *Eternal Flourishing* *Good Cultivation Abbey*, *Yixing’s* *Non-Action Abbey*, *Stone Steps’* *Distant Immortal Abbey*, *Scripture-Viewing* *Nine Perfected Abbey*, *North Pagoda’s* *Soaring Cloud Abbey*, *Miao Village’s* *Summoning Splendor Abbey*, *Recluse’s Dwelling* *Summoning Perfection Abbey*, *Lingzhi Mountain’s* *Jade Field Abbey*, *Resonant Stone’s* *Precious Terrace Abbey*, *Jade Pavilion’s* *Upper Immortal Abbey*, *Cloud Bridge’s* *Venerating Immortal Abbey*.

The aforementioned numinous traces are all detailed in Master Shen’s *Annotated True Records of the Two Perfected Ones*, and thus are not reiterated here.

**Jiyang’s Returning Immortal Abbey**—During his leisure from self-cultivation, Perfected Lord Wang journeyed to Jizhou, ascended Mount Jiyang, and rested at its foot, lingering for a long while. Before the altar stood a camphor tree, several armspans in girth, planted by the immortal’s own hand. Beneath it lay a cinnabar cauldron, which remains to this day. The present Returning Immortal Abbey lies in Luling County, forty *li* from the city.

**Taihe’s Welcoming Immortal Abbey**—Perfected Lord Guo traveled through Jizhou to Taihe County, sixty *li* from the county seat. The abbey, named Welcoming Immortal, was the place where Perfected Lord Guo sojourned and rested. Perfected Lord Wang later came to meet him here, and thus it was called Welcoming Immortal.

**Zhuxi’s Blessing Immortal Abbey**—Ten *li* from Welcoming Immortal, Perfected Lords Wang and Guo halted their steps at Zhuxi, where they bestowed blessings upon the common folk. The abbey was later established and named Blessing Immortal, over sixty *li* from Taihe.

**Jingkou’s Perfected Lord Wang Abbey**—In Taihe County, Jizhou, a hundred *li* from the county seat, lies a place called Nine Provinces Grotto. Atop it stands Mount Perfected Lord Wang. Beside the abbey, the alchemical cinnabar cauldron remains, along with a purple catalpa tree planted by his hand, several armspans in girth. Even now, when the flowers bloom, they rival those of the Jin era. The abbey is also called Perfected Lord Wang Abbey.

**Zhixia’s Supreme Empyrean Abbey**—In Luling County, Jizhou, at a place called Zhixia, stands an abbey named Supreme Empyrean. It was the site where Perfected Lords Wang and Guo passed through during the height of summer, hence its name. To this day, the local elders still call the place Zhixia.

**Dagao Ford’s Eternal Prosperity Abbey**—When Perfected Lords Wang and Guo arrived in Jizhou, fifteen *li* from the city, they found the great river treacherous for ferrymen. The two perfected ones cast their poles into the water and crossed upon them, while onlookers on both banks gazed in reverence. The site was thus named Dagao Ford. Where they landed, an abbey was established and named Eternal Prosperity. As Master Zeng of the Ritual Bureau once attested: On the day the two perfected ones arrived, the summer heat brought swarms of mosquitoes like a marketplace. The two perfected ones drove them away with their fans, vowing that the mosquitoes would retreat far. To this day, Eternal Prosperity alone remains free of mosquitoes.

Surrounded by encircling peaks, it too is a fine site.

Praying Perfection Abbey resides in the forty-second precinct of Qingyun Township of this county and was originally the Daoist sanctuary of Mount Huagai. During the Taihe era of the Song, seven transcendent geese appeared in the distance, flying from Mount Huagai and alighting in the pond outside the abbey gates. In the Qiande era, over two hundred gathered among the abbey’s pines and bamboos, and they also manifested during the Kaibao era. The Vice Minister Le Shi recorded these events.

Three *li* from the abbey lies a hot spring, where those afflicted with scabies find certain cure upon bathing. The Lay Scholar of Inexhaustible Worth, who served as Vice Minister of Transport in Jiangxi, passed through the region and composed a poem:

Yu Xian Pavilion lies fifty *li* from the county, with towering peaks. In years of drought, villagers sought to establish an immortal’s altar to welcome the Huagai Immortals and pray for rain. As they leveled the ground, they unearthed a stone, shaped like a *sheng* measure, upon which sat a golden mound less than an inch long. Examining it closely, they saw features resembling a human face, radiant with brilliance, and thus named it Fuqiu Golden Immortal. Devotees cherished and worshipped it, and whenever they found small spirit stones, they prayed for relief from illness, timely rain or sun, and pestilence—all requests were instantly answered. Those who coveted its gold and stole it fell rigid beside it, or their entire households suffered madness. Neighbors dreamed of a feather-robed figure wielding a sword entering the thief’s home, commanding them to confess and return it before peace was restored. Reverence spread far and wide, and later, silver statues of King Guo and his attendant were placed beside it.

Later, when the towering halls were completed, cultivation thrived even more. After building the temple and unearthing a cinnabar tripod and bronze brazier, the site was named Guangfu Abbey.

Ascending Flower Mountain, in Fuzhou’s Changle Township, is named Jiang Mountain. At its summit stands a Huagai hall, while below lies Su Mountain Dragon Pool.

Purple Canopy Peak, in Hengzhou’s Southern Marchmount, towers over five thousand four hundred *zhang*. Wreathed in purple mist like a radiant canopy, its form resembles a cover, originally called Flower Canopy Peak. Another name, Little Purple Canopy, also refers to this Flower Canopy Peak. While all other peaks pay homage to Zhu Rong in a bowing posture, this peak alone faces south. As Du Fu’s poem states:

*Zhu Rong, lord of five peaks,*
*Each peak rises and falls in turn.*

*Vying in height with a rival’s gaze.*

When the sky is clear, a pair of cranes circles above, and atop the peak stands Crane Cry Terrace. There is also an Immortal’s Pool, with Purple Canopy Abbey to the west.

They commanded spirits to build stone bridges, and within the cave are stored stone drums, stone bells, stone cymbals, and stone salt cauldrons.

Scholars and commoners flock here in reverence, especially during spring and autumn.

The Heaven-Measuring Lantern appears every night without fail, and the radiant halo often manifests as well. Its numinous resonance is most evident, and prayers here are never left unanswered. In times of drought or locust plagues, or when the people suffer from epidemics, the entire prefecture or county will come to this mountain to pray for deliverance, and the response is always immediate.

Fragrant Flower Mountain, under Jizhou’s jurisdiction, is also known as Tiger Brook and likewise serves as a sacred site for the Three Immortals. On its summit lies a stone grotto, within which resides the Thunder God, who governs the rains. When scholars and commoners pray for blessings here, the response is as swift as an echo. Once, a man who had performed the midnight *jiao* ritual on the altar stayed overnight on the mountain. In his dream, the deity hurled him down the slope, yet he emerged unharmed. Thereafter, those who came to pay homage dared not spend the night.

South Flower Mountain, belonging to Luling County in Jizhou, is also called Fragrant City and lies fifty *li* from the county seat.

Now, the Daoist Gan Wumin of Heavenly Celebration Abbey has built a hall and founded an abbey here, petitioning for the name "Extending the True." To this day, its incense and offerings grow ever more prosperous.

By nature aloof and upright, with a refined and luminous appearance, Shen Tingrui was initially named Shen Youlin. During the *Baoda* era of the Southern Tang, he abandoned his wife and entered the Jade Bamboo Mountain’s Plum Compassion Abbey, now known as Receiving Heaven Palace, where he changed his name to Tingrui.

Unassuming and forthright, he once strode directly to the county yamen without a pass. The prefect of Jizhou, who had come to the mountain for leisure, teased him: "Daoist Shen, when will your Dao be perfected?" Tingrui responded instantly with a poem:

*Why ask when my Dao will be perfected?*
*The date is set before Emperor Wu’s altar.*
*No one recognizes the herb seedlings I hold,*
*Yet all see the immortal bones within me.*
*My talismans send dragons and serpents fleeing,*
*My seals shift mountains and peaks.*
*From time to time, I watch the Jade Emperor’s edicts descend,*
*Followed by phoenixes and cranes in celestial flight.*

He often wandered deep into ancient mountain caves, disappearing for days. In bitter cold and snowstorms, he would sit alone in a single garment or go without food for months, or else drink wine and sing as he roamed. He could scale sheer cliffs and ascend towering trees with the agility of a monkey. When relatives came searching for him, he would flee to avoid them. Indifferent to worldly attachments, his depths remained unfathomable.

Once, while lodging in a mountain hut on Early Gathering Mountain, he behaved like an eccentric, warming himself by the fire in midsummer. Fellow Daoists often asked why, but he never answered.

In the second year of the *Yongxi* era of the Song, during the first month on Jade Bamboo Mountain, he fasted for seven days. On the fifteenth day, the Lantern Festival, he bade farewell to his fellow Daoists at the Gathering Immortals Pavilion in his abode. After reciting the *Rhapsody on How Fleeting Is Human Life*, he passed away without illness. He instructed his disciples to bury him with a copy of the *Scripture of Salvation* and a portrait of Saturn. His disciples followed his wishes.

Two years later, on the twentieth day of the second month, the Daoist Zeng Zhaoying of Hezao Mountain arrived from his abbey and encountered Shen at Ge Immortal’s Altar. When Zeng asked where he was going, Shen replied, "I am making a brief visit to Mount Lu to see an old friend." He then presented Zeng with the scripture and portrait he had kept, along with a parting poem:

*North, south, east, west—affairs of the world,*
*Will we meet again?*
*Once I wandered Jade Bamboo,*
*Now I return to the Original Capital.*
*Cloud wisps drift across the vast sky,*
*Spring sounds fall from solitary stones.*
*In the rosy dawn, someone has made an appointment,*
*To boil calamus together.*

Zeng carried these to Jade Bamboo Mountain. Upon hearing of Shen’s death, he recounted their encounter on the road and showed the scripture, portrait, and poem to others. All were astonished. They examined Shen’s tomb and found the earth split open, with a hole over a foot wide beside it. Inside lay a slip of paper with a final poem:

*In vain I prepared my grave before Jade Mountain,*
*Yet after burial, I shed my shell like a cicada.*
*My original spirit must have returned to its grotto,*
*No lingering soul remains in the Yellow Springs.*
*My spirit terrace has grasped the secrets of cultivation,*
*While the mortal world holds only my awakened verses.*
*How lamentable are the affairs of this fleeting life—*
*Beneath Northern Yu Mountain, the grasses grow lush.*

When they opened the tomb, they found only an empty coffin.

**Zhan Taichu**

Zhan Taichu, styled Yuanzuo, was originally a Daoist of the Chongyou Abbey on Mount Wuyi. During the *Xining* era of the Song, he came to sweep and tend Flower Canopy Mountain. One day, the county magistrate Guo Jun invited him to perform prayers on the mountain. As soon as Guo left the city, Taichu greeted him with a poem:

*The crane announces the Star Lord’s journey into the grotto,*
*Hastily I take up my staff to bid Floating Hill farewell.*
*Over rugged paths, I emerge from the white cloud road,*
*Leaping with joy to welcome the Pure Governance Marquis.*
*Auspicious vapors float afar, delighting the mountain phoenix,*
*Crimson robes shine brightly, shaming the wildflowers.*
*Dare I invite you to share wine in my thatched hut?*
*I smile and offer yellow essence, hoping you’ll stay awhile.*

Thereafter, they became close friends, and Taichu even cured Guo’s madness with cinnabar.

When the magistrate returned, he spoke of this to his colleagues. A county deputy named Zhang, wishing to behold the sacred realm, set out to visit Taichu. Before he had traveled several *li*, Taichu, having already foreseen his coming, greeted him along the road with a poem:

*The Plum Immortal’s retinue seeks Penglai,*
*An old rustic in green robes would fain keep you company.*
*Banner-tips part the azure haze,*
*Hooves trample the white cloud drifts.*
*Mountains and rivers burst forth in splendor beyond the forest’s edge,*
*Gibbons and cranes, hearing the wind, emerge from their grotto bounds.*
*Surely some perfected one will share laughter and words—*
*For here comes the immortal elder’s true descendant.*

Before they could engage in conversation, a peasant woman passed by. The deputy fixed his gaze upon her, his attention no longer on Taichu. Taichu remarked, “A monkey from Chu, dressed in a cap.” Enraged, the deputy turned to find Taichu already gone. Upon ascending the mountain, he asked where Taichu was, and his disciples replied, “The other day, he awoke from his midday nap and suddenly sounded the drum to depart.” When the deputy returned, the magistrate told him, “Not long after you left, Taichu came to the county office to resign.” Only then did the deputy regret his folly, realizing that Taichu’s retreat to the mountain, his resignation from office, and his encounter on the road were all signs of his extraordinary nature.

**Mao the Daoist**

Mao the Daoist—his given name and style are lost, and his origins unknown—dwelt on Flower Canopy Mountain during the *Jianyan* era. A mountain recluse built him a hut beside the Three Peaks. Winter and summer alike, he wore only a single garment and grew his own food. Many years passed, and the people of the time called him simply “Master Mao,” though none held him in reverence, dismissing him as a mad eccentric. He never spoke of worldly affairs, only smiling when he met others.

One day, he ascended the mountain’s summit and said to those nearby, “Tomorrow, I depart.” When they went to inspect his hut, they found it already engulfed in flames, with no trace of him—only his mortar for grinding medicine remained.

On the first day of the *jiayin* year of the *Shaoxing* era, he appeared at the Palace of Celestial Reception, where he encountered the Daoist Yao Yanzhang and offered him a bronze seal. Yao refused, but Mao smiled and took it away. Later, he stayed in the government hall, where each night he propped open the door and never slept. By day, he would go out, never once unlocking the gate.

The Master was well-versed in the scriptures of all Three Teachings. Wherever he encountered spirit shrines, he often destroyed them. Once, when villagers gathered to humiliate him, though he was wounded and bled profusely, he merely washed himself with water, and no trace of injury remained. He enjoyed climbing tall trees and hanging upside down from their branches by his feet. Passing through Ancheng, he entered the water without crossing the bridge. Onlookers feared he would drown, but soon he emerged onto the shore, his clothes completely dry.

Later, he inscribed a poem at Yangsu Hermitage in Nanyang:

*"The benevolent have always loved the mountains,
To love the mountains is to hide in their secluded bays.
Concealing oneself in seclusion, one admires lofty purity,
Washing the spirit’s terrace to nurture serene leisure.
Du Fu often longed for a thousand grand halls,
Lu Tong cherished but a few thatched huts.
Freely unfolding and folding, one becomes a guest who forgets worldly schemes,
Honor and disgrace, poverty and prosperity—none of these matter."*

After secluding himself there, he was never seen again.

**Recluse Rao**
Rao Dongtian, a native of Linchuan in Fuzhou, was initially a county clerk. Later, he dreamed of a divine being who said, *"Your heart is just, your enforcement of the law strict—your name has moved Heaven."* Awakening from the dream, he was enlightened. That night on Huagai Mountain, he witnessed a five-colored radiance ascending to the heavens before the Ascension Altar. Following the light, he dug into the earth and retrieved a golden casket. Opening it, he found a jade-scripture Daoist text titled *The Orthodox Method of the Heavenly Heart Sutra*. Though he obtained this sacred text, its wonders eluded him. He dwelled in constant invisibility, his concentrated meditation piercing the mysteries.

A feathered immortal told him, *"You should seek Master Tan, known as Zixiao, and take him as your teacher."* For years afterward, he journeyed until he encountered the master in Nanfeng. After receiving instruction, he suddenly grasped the profound principles. The master then led him to pay homage to the Emperor of the Eastern Peak, who said, *"By the decree of the Three Immortal Daoists, I confer upon you the treasure seal and the command of the nether troops."* After receiving it, the recluse traversed many paths, subduing malevolent spirits, vanquishing evil demons, praying for relief from floods and droughts, summoning wind and thunder, commanding gods and spirits, and aiding people and all beings. Thus, hundreds from all directions, drawn to the Dao, became his followers.

One day, he led his disciples to the summit of Huagai Mountain and imparted the supreme Dao to them, swearing an oath: *"Guard your qi, refrain from idle speech, renounce profit and sensual pleasures. Establishing merit is foremost; repenting for transgressions comes next. Saving people from illness, disasters, floods, and droughts is the highest merit. Loyalty, filial piety, harmony, and trustworthiness are the foundation of conduct. Those who practice these will align with the Dao and follow the unseen; though they may not have bowed before the Most High, they shall dwell among the immortals."*

He then said, *"Today is the assembly of the True Immortals of Green Bamboo Peak. You have been summoned—you cannot stay."* Waving farewell to his disciples, he stirred the wind and raised the dust, moving as swiftly as a galloping horse, until he vanished without a trace. From then on, the orthodox method spread widely.

**Divine Responses to Pilgrims Seeking Medicine**
In his *Record of the Zhangren Temple on Mount Qingcheng*, Chancellor Zhang Wujin wrote: *"Exploring the grotto heavens, gods may be cultivated and mortals may transcend; the spirits of plants and trees may extend life and cure illness. Today, on Huagai Mountain, every herb and tree—when boiled and drunk—can heal disease. Verified through the ages, this is indeed true. Daily, pilgrims gather at the Three Peaks, not all to fulfill vows. Many, suffering from illness and pain, knock at the immortals’ gates seeking medicine, and none are left unanswered. Those who wish to seek it must first perform rituals or recite scriptures, erecting grand victory altars. For those without means, mere pilgrimage and divination by moon blocks suffice. Whether in the northwest or southeast, herbs gathered from any place are wondrous medicines—when boiled, their fragrance fills the air; when drunk, pain vanishes instantly. Cut deeply, dig thoroughly, take roots and leaves together, regardless of their names, and gather them all. Once the herbs are in hand, divination must be performed again: some are boiled with wine, others with water. When the illness is cured, one should express gratitude. Upon returning home, place the medicine on the altar of the Great Immortal in a clean hall, offer incense, then seek a pure vessel to boil it. It must be thoroughly cooked. With utmost sincerity, gaze toward the distant summit, click your teeth, and consume it. One should also maintain purity and fasting—none fail to see results. Countless miraculous responses have occurred before and since.*

*Now, surrounding the mountain are naturally occurring wondrous herbs, though regrettably, not all their names are known. Here, I record those I have heard of—no fewer than several kinds—respectfully listed below:*
*Pinellia, Aconite, Platycodon, Virgate Wormwood, Solomon’s Seal, Dragon’s Beard Grass, Asarum, Achyranthes, Ghost’s Umbrella.*

In the county lived Luo Fugan Bin, who had no heir. Day and night, he silently prayed to Huagai Mountain, and on the first and fifteenth of each month, he performed rituals at the Zhaoqing Altar, beseeching a dream response. In the *xinhai* year of the *Shaoxing* era, he suddenly dreamed of a purple-robed Daoist who gave him three plums, one of which was slightly spoiled. The next day, he went to Huagai to give thanks. He surmised the dream foretold three sons. The following year, he indeed had a son, and in the *jiayin* year, another. Later, he had a third son named Can, who, though he entered school, died young. This fulfilled the dream of the one spoiled plum. The immortals’ dream responses are thus divinely efficacious.

**A General Offers a Vegetarian Feast to Soldiers Who Defiled the Altar**
At the end of the *Shaoxing* era, the imperial court recruited soldiers. One day, a general led over two hundred newly enlisted crossbowmen from the Ten Thousand Crossbows Battalion to spend the night at the Zhaoqing Huagai Altar. They defiled the place with filth and excrement, beyond description. That night, the general dreamed of three Daoists appearing from the clouds, requesting a vegetarian feast. The general bowed and replied, *"I am here now, but have not yet prepared anything. Please wait a moment."* He bowed again, and suddenly the Daoists vanished. The next morning, he recounted the dream to his superiors. The abbot of the temple, Yuan Daoxing, entered the hall with him to burn incense. There, they beheld the statues—solemn and lifelike—just as those seen in the dream.

The general deeply reflected upon this: *"These great immortals did not truly seek a vegetarian feast. Rather, the soldiers had defiled the place with excessive filth, and the Perfected Ones desired purity—vegetarian offerings being a symbol of purity."* He bowed again, then immediately ordered the troops to march out, forbidding them to stay any longer. Thus, the general came to revere and believe in the Dao.

**A Woodcutter Obtains Immortal Scriptures Beneath the Purple Mystery Grotto**
Beneath the Purple Mystery Grotto of Huagai, one day a woodcutter surnamed Lu went to gather sedge grass. The more he searched, the more he found, until unknowingly he entered a grotto. There, he saw a stone table, a couch-like formation, and a fully furnished desk. Upon the desk stood an incense burner, its lingering fragrance rich and sweet. Beside it lay several scrolls of scripture. As he read halfway through the central scroll, the woodcutter gazed upon it with reverence, then gathered the books and returned home. Unable to discern their meaning, he showed them to a neighbor surnamed Huang, who likewise could not decipher them. They kept the scrolls, and to this day, they remain preserved. Originally, Lu had taken six scrolls, but after returning home, he dreamed of a Daoist coming to reclaim them. He returned five, keeping one. This remaining scroll is now in the care of Huang Zun’s family. Whenever they pray and invoke it, their prayers are answered. Some eight or nine *li* from the Jade Morning Abbey, the blessings extend to this entire neighborhood, and the people remain deeply grateful.

**Perfected Lord Guo Manifests in Hubei to Save a Household from Epidemic**
During the *Qiandao* era, in Hubei, there lived a local magnate of immense wealth whose household fell gravely ill with an epidemic. One day, a Daoist arrived at his door to offer teachings. A servant waved him away, saying, *"Begone, Daoist. We have nothing to give—our master’s entire family is unwell."* The Daoist asked, *"What ails them?"* The servant replied, *"A raging pestilence."* The Daoist said, *"I can consecrate water to cure them instantly."* The servant said, *"If this is true, our master will provide whatever you require. Wait here while I report back."* The master, upon hearing this, was overjoyed and sent the servant to invite the Daoist to stay. The servant then drew water for the Daoist to consecrate. The Daoist took the water, rinsed his mouth several times, then instructed the servant to hurry it to the master’s family. From eldest to youngest, each drank the water, and their illnesses were cured. Before the day was out, the servant brought the water in, and the master, after rinsing his mouth and drinking, found his entire household’s afflictions cleared, their strength fully restored.

The master then urgently sent the servant to ask the Daoist’s name. The Daoist replied, *"I am surnamed Guo."* When asked where he resided, he said, *"In Chongren County, Fuzhou, beneath Huagai Mountain in a thatched hut."* When pressed for the exact location, he replied, *"At the foot of Huagai Mountain."* Learning the Daoist’s name and dwelling, the master immediately arranged for his stay, preparing meals and incense in hopes of retaining him. The Daoist suddenly said, *"I passed by here and knew your household was stricken, so I came to save you. Now that your illness is cured, I have already arranged to meet a Daoist friend at a famous mountain and cannot stay long."* The master said, *"Stay with us—even a year or two would not be too long. Why leave so soon?"* The Daoist replied, *"I will return in a day or two. Do not worry."* Despite the master’s efforts to detain him, he departed.

The master waited for days, then months, then years, but the Daoist never returned. He then sent a messenger with gifts and a generous sum of money to the mountain to seek out the hut of Daoist Guo. After days of searching, they found nothing. A woodcutter and village elder told them, *"There has never been a hut belonging to a Daoist Guo on this mountain. Could this be a manifestation of Perfected Lord Guo of the mountain?"* They advised, *"Quickly prepare incense and paper offerings and hold a grand ritual to give thanks."* The man followed their instructions, ascending the mountain to offer his gratitude. Upon returning to the county, he stayed at Hu’s Inn and shared the story with acquaintances. Alas! The transformations of true immortals and their numinous responses are truly wondrous.

**The Huagai Cliff Admonishes Cook Liu for Indecency**
In the fifth month of the final year of the *Qiandao* era, near the outskirts of Yihuang County, some three or four *li* away, stood a cliff called Huaxian. The abbey there was named Yuanbao, the sacred site of Perfected Lords Wang and Guo. The cliff’s grottoes were strange and wondrous, with stone beams spanning above and below—a sight unmatched in beauty for miles around.

That month, the abbey was observing the Thunder Fast. A cook named Liu, who had always been careless and irreverent, held no belief in immortals or Buddhas. That evening, he slept in the Three Immortals Pavilion. The immortals’ statues, originally enshrined at the summit, had been temporarily moved to the pavilion during hall renovations. Liu, stripped bare and shameless, urinated and defecated directly beneath the pavilion’s eaves, showing no restraint. After some time, he suddenly noticed a path descending from the pavilion. Following it, he found himself in a bamboo grove, unable to proceed further. Realizing he had fallen into the undergrowth, he cried out loudly for help.

The monks unbolted the gate and saw him—naked—beneath the bamboo. When asked what had happened, he only pleaded, *"Help me!"* They pushed through brambles and thorns, lifting Liu to level ground. After some time, he regained his senses and recounted: *"When I relieved myself, I saw a path and followed it down. But then I found myself surrounded by bamboo, the darkness closing in. Only then did I realize my mistake and cry for help."* It became clear he had offended Perfected Lords Wang and Guo. Yet in their mercy, they spared him serious harm, merely revealing his transgression to display their numinous power. All who heard the tale were struck with awe and fear.

In the dream, the Perfected Lord of the Flourishing Canopy wore regal robes and a crown. On the first day of the second month in the *jihai* year of the Chunxi era—the very day of Wang and Guo’s ascension—Yuanshu prepared incense and tea, burning a congratulatory memorial. That night, past the second watch, he suddenly dreamed he was ascending the hall of his own abbey when he beheld the Three Perfected Lords of the Flourishing Canopy, their countenances dignified and solemn as ever. Gazing upon their headdresses, he saw each adorned with a ceremonial crown, their robes and curtains majestic to behold. At the sides stood the Stellar Lords and the Perfected of the Grasses, all clad in ordinary attire yet resplendent in brilliance. As he marveled and paid homage, the dream abruptly dissolved.

Yuanshu pondered this deeply: had it been mere imagination, the Flourishing Canopy Lords would not have appeared in such regal vestments. He surmised that the Three Perfected Lords, having received the Emperor’s mandate, feared their status remained unknown in the mortal realm. Thus, they revealed themselves in a dream to Yuanshu, that he might enlighten the faithful. Just as Fuqiu’s merits and deeds shone brightly, crowning him among the Immortals, so too might the Perfected Lords Wang and Guo hold ranks and authority beyond mere stewardship of Jiangnan. This account is recorded here, awaiting the discernment of worthy scholars—should any dream or revelation align with it, this doubt may yet be resolved.

**The Mountain South Elder Responds to Wang’s Plea for an Heir**
In Raozhou, a certain Wang, a provincial official, encountered Yuanshu while paying homage to the Flourishing Canopy. As they spoke of Mount Hua’s wonders, Wang suddenly asked, *"Have you heard of the Mountain South Elder?"* Yuanshu replied, *"Why do you ask?"* Wang answered, *"I was he in a former life."*

Yuanshu pressed him for the story. Wang recounted: *"My father had no heir. Despite fervent prayers, no answer came. Seeking counsel from elder Daoists, I was told that if I wished for descendants, I must journey a thousand *li* to the Flourishing Canopy. I purified myself, set out, and after many days reached the summit. There, I commissioned a Daoist priest to perform a *jiao* ritual and burn a petition, vowing to make an annual pilgrimage. If a son were granted, I would hold grand rites to repay the Immortals’ grace. In the third year, while lodging on the mountain, I dreamed of three Daoists bowing to me, saying, ‘We thank you for your long journey. Though you were childless, we now send the Mountain South Elder to be your heir.’ With those words, I awoke, still wrapped in my blanket, and pondered their meaning with great joy. Without waiting for dawn, I purified myself, ascended the hall, and prostrated a hundred times in gratitude. Upon returning home, my wife conceived, and when her term was full, she bore a son. Thereafter, I faithfully returned each year to the mountain, building temples and holding *jiao* rites in thanks. When my son grew, I brought him to pay homage. Now, I come alone, and by the Immortals’ grace, I have five sons. How could I ever repay such a blessing?"* Yuanshu heard this tale firsthand and thus recorded it with reverence.

**The Perfected of the Grasses Yield Their Seats to Fuqiu**
During the Shaoxing era, a devout friend in the county commissioned statues of the Four Perfected of Bashan, the Three Perfected of Huashan, and the Twelve Perfected of Yulong. Once the work was complete, a day was chosen to install them at Bashan. The original intent was to honor the Bashan Perfected, with the Perfected of the Grasses as secondary. On the appointed day, as they ascended the mountain to arrange the seats, they placed Mei, Yue, Deng, and Ye in the central positions, with the others arrayed beside them in order. Just as the incense was lit and the ritual began, a sudden storm erupted—wind and rain clashed, thunder and lightning flashed—and the assembly grew uneasy. The lamps flickered, making reverence impossible. All believed some offense had been committed. Casting divination blocks yielded no response, deepening their distress. From immediate worries to distant anxieties, their prayers went unanswered.

After repeated attempts, one of the elder masters stepped out of rank and addressed the Perfected, saying: "Are not Mei, Yue, Deng, and Ye the Perfected of the Western Mountains’ drought? Yet the Teaching Master, the Transcendent Lord Fuqiu of the Flourishing Canopy of Huashan, has been placed at the lowest seat, causing unease among the assembled Perfected. By propriety and deference, he should be invited to occupy the central position." Upon this counsel, they sought an auspicious omen. No sooner had the words been spoken than the divination yielded a favorable sign. All present cast the blocks to the ground in astonishment, and both transcendent and mortal minds aligned. Immediately, they moved Fuqiu to the central seat, with Mei, Yue, Deng, and Ye arrayed to his left and right, while Xu, Guo, Wang, Guo, and Ban followed in ordered ranks. Then they prayed again, saying: "Now that the Perfected’s seats are properly arranged, we humbly beseech the wind to cease and the rain to still, that all may find peace and no longer feel fear." As the auspicious conditions aligned, all was granted by the Perfected. In an instant, a single clap of thunder resounded, clouds dispersed, and mists rolled away. The stars and Milky Way shone brightly, the chime of qing-bells rang clear, and a wondrous fragrance suffused the air. With sincerity deepened, the ritual was thus fulfilled.

*Record of the Sandalwood Image of the Flourishing Canopy’s Golden Statue*
The sandalwood golden statue depicts the Three Perfected Lords of the Flourishing Canopy. This recalls the deeds of Prefect Xiong of the commandery. His name was Pu, styled Bowen. During the Zhenghe era, while studying at the Imperial Academy, he revered the Perfected morning and night. After passing the examinations, he served as Registrar of Rongzhou. When a fire broke out in the commandery, the wind raged fiercely. Donning his official robes, he bowed twice, and the statue appeared in midair—whereupon the flames subsided at once. Later, as Magistrate of Jiande, when bandits raided the region, he fasted and prayed in secret, and the district was spared from disaster. As Governor of Haikang, he had long cherished the immortal traces of his homeland’s mountains and, in devotion to the Perfected, established the foundation of Zhaoqing Abbey, where the statue was enshrined with incense offerings. The statue’s adornments were immaculate, its craftsmanship exquisitely refined.

The thief, coveting its value, once plotted to steal it by night, but a divine radiance and thunderous resonance struck terror into him, and he returned it in fear. At the time, Yuan Gui had long heard of these wonders. Resolving to carve the tale in stone for posterity, he one day spoke of it to the grandsons of Magistrate Xiong. Later, through his cousin Wu Jun, a professor in Lizhou, he obtained a record of the events. The sacred image was then engraved upon a stele, to be disseminated far and wide. Truly, this was a marvel.

**The Perfected Immortals Descend and Possess a Youth**
Wu Jing, a Gentleman for Court Service of this district, had previously received the transmission of the Upper Clarity esoteric methods. On the Mid-Autumn Festival of the dingchou year of the Shaoxing era, he ascended the mountain to pay homage. Suddenly, the Perfected Immortals descended and possessed a youth, who sat at the table with extraordinary speech. After a moment, he demanded paper and brush, writing:
*"Three peaks rise sheer, ten thousand fathoms pierce the sky.
The cavern-heaven stands silent—here is my abode."*

He then appended a postscript:
*"On this Mid-Autumn night, I shall meet with the Orthodox Unity Perfected, along with Lords Deng and Ye, to descend upon your home."*

Wu Jing glanced back briefly, then knelt to receive the immortal missive, sighing in awe without end. That night, he lodged at the immortal altar, gazing all around at the sacred realm. Reflecting that Bashan had its Round Radiance Pavilion beside the altar, he thought this blessed site yet lacked such a pavilion, leaving his heart unsatisfied. If the Perfected Immortals were to grant a response and command him to build it, he would surely comply.

That night, the mountain-monitoring Daoist Jiang Ruochong secretly prayed to the Perfected Immortals, seeking their decree to have Wu Jing construct a Talismanic Water Pavilion. Wu Jing, however, knew nothing of this. The next day, as he took leave at the altar’s base, the Perfected Immortals once more possessed the youth, urging him to build the Talismanic Water and Round Radiance Pavilion. Wu Jing pondered: the Round Radiance Pavilion was already his wish, but adding the Talismanic Water Pavilion—he wondered at the immortals’ intent. Jiang Ruochong then revealed his own prayer, and it became clear that his supplication had been answered.

Wu Jing thus accepted the immortal decree. On the Zhongyuan Festival of the wuyin year, construction began, and by the time of completion, it was once again Mid-Autumn. He respectfully presented offerings and repented, whereupon the youth delivered another response, promising the manifestation of a round radiance. At noon the following day, a fierce wind suddenly arose from the Purple Mystery Grotto, clouds and mist swirling together, followed by a torrential downpour. After a moment, a five-colored immortal bridge emerged from the grotto, spanning far to the Immortal Bridge Abbey before vanishing. Moved by the depth of the immortals’ favor, Wu Jing commissioned the casting of a bronze bell to inscribe the entire account, forever enshrining it at the sacred altar. To this day, it remains extant for verification.

**Reciting the Sacred Name of Perfected Lord Huagai to Escape Drowning**
Beneath Huagai Mountain, in a place called Pifu, there lived a merchant named Chen Si, known to the villagers as Hua the Fourth. His family revered the immortals with utmost devotion. His eldest son traveled to Gaoyou Prefecture for trade, but as their boat sailed, it capsized in the waters. All aboard perished—save the son, who desperately cried out the sacred name of the Great Immortal. Clinging to the mast, he drifted for a day and a night, unaware of his whereabouts. Nearby, he moored by a reed thicket, where two elders rowed a small boat to his rescue. They lifted him ashore, revived him with fire, and fed him congee. After two or three days, he gradually regained his strength. The elders’ boat held nothing else, yet they gave him their remaining provisions, bidding him farewell with these words: *"From here, there are still three or five stages without human habitation. Press onward as we say, and you will surely reach your destination."*

Following their instructions, he indeed found the path and returned home. His family, believing him dead, had already completed the seven days of mourning rites and finished the Buddhist memorial service. When they saw his emaciated, disheveled form at the door, the household suspected a ghost. Only after some time did they believe it was truly him. When asked how he survived, he recounted that in his moment of peril, invoking the sacred name of the Three Immortals—Huagai and Fuqiu—had saved his life.

**Reciting the Sacred Name to Escape a Mountain Collapse**
Near a mountain in a place called Qifu, there lived a villager whose surname was forgotten. For generations, his family had worshipped the Three Immortals. During the Shaoxing era, the mountain suddenly collapsed—a phenomenon the common folk called a *"mountain roar."* The land before, behind, and on all sides of his home crumbled at once. The entire household cried out in unison, reciting the sacred name of the Great Immortal to seek deliverance. Beyond their four eaves, all became a deep chasm, yet their home stood as if upon a high terrace, untouched by the destruction. Thus, they were spared. Later, they relocated, and the site was ruined.

**A Servant’s Meat-Eating Receives a Stern Warning**
In the spring of the Qiandao era, Chen Zaowei of Caoping prepared to make his annual pilgrimage to the mountain. The night before, he instructed his tenant guests—over twenty men—to ready their sedan chairs and luggage. All who were to accompany him observed abstinence, save for one, a servant named Zhou Yatui. That day, his family had purchased pork and cooked it nearly done. His father said: *"My son, Master Chen is taking you up the mountain—you must not eat meat."* The son retorted: *"Going up the mountain is his affair; what does it have to do with me?"* After chewing and swallowing, he nonetheless joined the ascent.

After the ritual offerings concluded and the group descended, the servant suddenly vanished. Chen Zao said: *"He must be following behind; why has he not arrived by nightfall?"* The next morning, he sent men up the mountain to search. At Bloodwood Hollow, they found a bamboo hat, then followed a faint trail down the mountainside. Further on, they discovered a headscarf, and later, the luggage—untouched. They carried it back with another servant. Continuing the search, they found the man on the northern side of the mountain, near a place called Late Pit, suspended in midair before the Three Gates of the apes, bound upright and unconscious.

By evening, they carried him home and revived him with fire. The next day, he could speak. When asked what had happened, he said: *"Around mid-mountain, four men in martial attire suddenly seized and dragged me down—I know not how I came to be here."* He then vowed to repent and beg forgiveness, and only then did he awaken. Such was the warning he received.

**The Fifth Scroll of the Records of the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain, Fuqiu, and Wang**
**The Sixth Scroll of the Records of the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain, Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo**

**The Great Immortal Dispatches Thunder to Punish the Wicked**

In the early years of the Chunxi era, six brothers from two families in a remote village of Luling ascended the mountain to pay homage. When they reached the summit at midday, they asked the mountain’s keeper: *"Is there any livestock here?"* The keeper replied: *"This is a sacred realm, a mere footspan from heaven—how could one slaughter animals here?"* The men said: *"We have not abstained from meat on our journey. Just yesterday, at our lodging, we killed a dog. Since there is none here, we shall eat plain rice."*

After completing their worship, they refused to stay in the hermitage that evening, insisting instead on sleeping beneath the main altar of the immortal’s hall. Around the first watch, the hermitage suddenly heard a man’s long cry for help. The keeper, holding a candle, ascended the altar and saw five of the six men struck by thunder and flame, unconscious. One, though scorched, retained some awareness and begged for help, saying they had all been burned by thunder. They were carried down to the hermitage, where the men vowed repentance and begged forgiveness through rituals. Four revived at once, but the two ringleaders lay cold, their hearts barely warm, unable to speak. By dawn, as porters carried them down two or three *li*, the two leaders died, while the other four remained unharmed. Thereafter, the wicked all learned reverence, and none who ascended the mountain failed to fast and purify themselves.

**Pleading with the Immortals to Avert Death by Landslide**

At the foot of Great Floating Mountain lived a man named Yanxian, whose surname is now lost. On the fifth day of the fifth month in the *jihai* year of the Chunxi era, a sudden rumbling arose behind his house. He rushed to look and saw the mountain collapsing, its force certain to crush them all. With his entire family facing death, he panicked and, in desperation, turned toward Great Floating Mountain to plead with the Three Immortals of Huagai, vowing to hold rituals and worship the mountain in earnest supplication. Suddenly, the landslide halted, and his family survived. To this day, the scar of the split mountain remains, a striking testament to this miracle.

Half a *li* from Yanxian’s home lived a man named Zhang Bangchang. That same day, his household was struck by a landslide, killing half his family. Alas! Yanxian, who had pleaded with the immortals, was thus blessed, while Bangchang, who had not, met such disaster. How can the people of this world fail to revere the perfected immortals?

**Wu Yaya Receives a Book of Daoist Arts in a Dream**

On the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month in the *renyin* year of the Chunxi era, just before dawn, Master Wu Yaya dreamed he was at Chongxian Abbey on Huagai Mountain, seated atop a three-tiered bamboo grove. Suddenly, he saw Daoist Jiang, clad in a mountain-dweller’s coarse robe, approaching. Wu led him up to the bamboo platform, and they exchanged bows. As they conversed, they found themselves in a tower. Daoist Jiang vanished, and two other Daoists appeared—one in purple, tall and bearded with a dignified, gaunt face; the other neither stout nor tall, poised and refined. Each held a scroll of written text. They bowed to Wu, who prostrated himself and asked: *"What are these writings in your hands?"* The Daoist replied: *"These are books of the Daoist arts."*

**I requested to borrow and examine them, and once I had both in hand, I tucked them into my sleeve. Yet I persisted in entreating them. One of the Daoists consented, but the tall, bearded one in purple grew displeased and insisted on reclaiming them. I resisted, and we struggled. Though I knew clearly this was a dream, I thought to myself: *As long as they enter my sleeve, I shall possess them even upon waking.*

The one who had consented then persuaded the purple-robed Daoist to descend the tower. Beside me stood another figure, clad in black, short and slight of stature, who repeatedly urged me to open a basket and conceal the books of the Daoist arts. Soon after, he summoned someone resembling the groundskeeper Huang Quan, who unlocked the basket and secured them inside.

I awoke, still pondering the dream, and after a long while, fell asleep again. Once more, I dreamed I ascended the tower, where the two Daoists reappeared. I called out loudly to my master, expressing gratitude for the books, and knelt in repeated bows—so many I lost count—until the purple-robed one at last smiled.

Kneeling before him, I spoke: *"Though the books you bestowed contain no secrets, I humbly beseech your instruction."* The purple-robed Daoist replied: *"Wait while I fetch them to show you."* From a small pouch at his waist, he drew several black fragments, resembling stone, each barely an inch long and half an inch wide. He tossed them across the table, and with each pass, they transformed into small swords. After a dozen repetitions, the blades gradually lengthened to nearly four inches. I thought to myself: *This must be the art of the flying sword.*

The Daoist examined the sword, then tossed it again, and it changed into a living fish, about three inches long. He held it in his hand—its scales shimmered in hues of blue-green and white, its patterns like embroidery, its head, tail, and fins distinct. Through its translucent scales, its moving entrails were visible. As the Daoist observed it, a spring suddenly welled up from the ground, forming a pool over a foot wide, into which he released the fish to swim.

After some time, the fish transformed into a bird, the size of a swan-goose, its features vivid, its plumage like brocade, green and white intermingled. It had two heads and two bodies, one before the other, and it flew above me in circles. I thought: *This is a test from the immortals—I must not be afraid.* Suddenly, it alighted upon my left arm. After a moment, the purple-robed Daoist said: *"Come, do not startle it."*

The bird perched on the ground beside a small basin filled with sesame seeds. The Daoist remarked: *"We consume much grain in our practice—this was requisitioned from the Heavenly Pivot Institute."* I asked for a small portion, but he refused. After repeated entreaties, he smiled faintly and said: *"You may have a little."* He took a gourd, poured out a single seed—large as a hemp grain—and placed it in my palm.

Another Daoist nearby held small green pellets, each the size of a needle’s tip, and with his fingers, counted out eleven, combining them with the sesame seed. I said: *"Some must have been taken by the earth spirits."* The Daoist smiled slightly. As I turned, I saw yet another Daoist behind me eating the small green pellets. I begged for some and received over twenty. Together with the earlier ones, I tossed them into my mouth. Two or three felt slightly larger, and I swallowed them with effort, though two or three more fell to the ground.

I thought: *This is immortal medicine. Having consumed it, I must now have a share in immortality.* Overjoyed, I bowed in thanks to the three Daoists. Two of them descended into a rocky cavern, while I clung to the stone with both hands, leaning forward to peer inside. There, I saw the two Daoists lying like sleeping pigs, conversing. I thought: *I must not approach, lest I lose them—or worse, give offense.*

The tall, bearded Daoist in purple remained asleep where I had first bowed. Suddenly, I realized: *These are the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai—Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo!* I prostrated myself at once and approached, saying: *"Today I have encountered true immortals. I beseech the arts of saving the world. My usual methods—talismans and healing waters—lack efficacy. I beg your instruction."*

The purple-robed one asked: *"Why do you so earnestly seek potent arts?"* I replied: *"I see many in the world harmed by malevolent spirits, their lives wrongly cut short. I have vowed to save them."* As I knelt again to entreat him, I suddenly awoke. The immortal medicine still lingered warmly in my throat. That day was a *jiazi*, an auspicious day.

My fellow devotees in the town borrowed the ritual hall to pay homage to the Perfected Sages. I presented a memorial, briefly recounting my experience and inviting the Three Immortals to be enshrined in the hall, seeking their protection and aid to make the Daoist arts manifest. On the twenty-seventh day, I recorded these events. Thereafter, my talismans and healing waters proved far more efficacious than before. I journeyed to Huagai Mountain to commission statues of the Three Immortals and, upon their completion, installed them in my home.

That night, I dreamed again of the tall, bearded Daoist in purple, accompanied by the other two, arriving at my hall. As I gazed upon them in reverence, I suddenly awoke.

One day, Yuan Shu visited my home. By chance, the conversation turned to my recent transmission of the *Huagai Nine-One Supreme Clarity Method*. He expressed his intent to receive it in due course. I recounted the preceding events in vivid detail, and Yuan Shu was astonished.

Reflecting on this, I realized the Three Perfected Ones had manifested themselves, tirelessly instructing and guiding those who seek the Way. Never before had I witnessed such a display.

**A Mother’s Sudden Recovery**

In the *wuyin* year of the Shaoxing era, my elder brother Zhang Yuanshu’s mother, Madam Wu, fell gravely ill. Despite fervent prayers, there was no response. He then undertook a fast and pilgrimage to Huagai Mountain. Though he was to return within days, he had not yet arrived when, one day, he inquired of Pengxian. The Three Immortal Masters descended, and his mother, burning incense at the hearth, asked of her son’s return and her own recovery.

The immortals, through the planchette, bestowed a poem:
*Atop Hua Peak’s lofty summit, clouds part like a thoroughfare,*
*Where true immortals once refined elixirs in their furnace.*
*This realm is not so easily attained—*
*Return, and all ailments shall vanish like mist.*

The next day, my brother arrived, and his mother’s illness immediately abated. Thereafter, she enjoyed a long life, and my brother and his kin were able to fulfill their filial duties in full—all by the grace of the immortals.

The Account of Madam Jia’s Return from the Netherworld

On the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month in the *jiāchén* year of the *Chúnxī* reign (1184), Madam Jia, wife of Wú Tián Yànhé, a nephew serving as Gentleman for Ceremonial, suddenly collapsed at noon without prior illness and died. For a time, she remained insensible, her body grown entirely cold. Her family gathered around, unable to revive her. Then, abruptly, her eyes flickered open, as though she wished to speak. When asked what had happened, she said:

Three women had invited her to the bank of the front harbor to watch the floodwaters. Suddenly, she saw Tián’s mother, her hairpin broken and cap in disarray, who urged her to return home, for no one was there to care for her. She was then escorted back by a neighbor, Officer Chéng.

After a while, she saw Tián’s father and grandfather, both clad in early-morning robes with purple sashes. Her grandfather called out, “Little one, I wish to return and support you and your husband in old age.” Madam Jia asked, “Grandfather, you are already old—how can you care for us in our old age?” He only laughed in response, then added, “Bǎiwǔláng’s family servant, Zhōu Bǎo, is me. Later, I will not stay with them but return to your household.” He then counted on his fingers and said, “I shall return in a few days.” When Madam Jia pressed, “On which day will you return?” he replied, “I will come as soon as the celestial writ arrives. But you are a new bride and cannot endure my presence—you will still be ill for another fifteen or ten days.”

He continued, “Day after day, I linger at the Pavilion of Illustrious Clarity. I have long wished to return, but your household has no food to offer me, nor clothes to wear.” He then declared, “I shall bring back a residence, four wells of coin, three streets, and one pond.”

Madam Jia next saw a magistrate holding a register, who showed her and said, “Your husband’s fate is evenly balanced. Do not worry—there is still joy ahead.” He added, “Your husband has donated a hundred strings of cash to the Eastern Peak, earning sixty merits, which place him in the seventh rank of the register.” When Madam Jia asked, “Why only sixty?” the magistrate replied, “Do not inquire into the ways of the netherworld.”

After speaking, Madam Jia revived. When questioned repeatedly about what she had said, she claimed to remember nothing. Only after drinking water did she fully awaken.

By dusk, Madam Jia spoke again: “I feel unwell—quickly, save me!” No sooner had she finished speaking than she died once more. After about an hour, she revived and said she had seen someone at the door demanding payment for shoes. When no one responded, three figures entered before her. One wore purple, one green, and one white. The purple-clad figure instructed Madam Jia to ask Tián: “Why did you refuse the twenty strings of cash from Sānbāniáng?” and “Why did you refuse the wealth and fields of the Liú family?” Tián kowtowed and replied, “I fear Heaven and sin—how dare I take what belongs to others?” The purple-clad figure said, “These were but tests.” Then, pointing elsewhere, he showed Madam Jia a room filled with coins and grain, saying, “This belongs to your husband.” After a while, the room was locked, and three keys were given to Madam Jia to keep on her family’s table.

The two in purple then explained, “We are the judges of good and evil at the Eastern Peak. Eight of your ten stars have toppled—only two remain. You are also aided by a neighboring star, your husband’s star, and your grandfather’s return, which is why you have not yet been taken. Otherwise, you would have departed long ago.”

Shortly after, the purple-clad figure brought a register to the table, holding a brush to transcribe. The register was filled with tiny black characters, which Madam Jia could not read, though she recognized two large red characters: *xīn hǎo* (good heart). He showed her and said, “Your husband’s heart is good—I shall memorialize this tomorrow.” With that, they departed. Her family again gave her water, and she revived once more. When questioned repeatedly, she claimed to recall nothing.

On the first day of the fifth month, Hao Tian prepared incense and paper to offer before the Sacred Emperor of the Eastern Peak in gratitude, and to apologize to the Judges of Good and Evil. As he left the Peak’s gate, he encountered his elder brother Cheng (styled Ciyang), who asked the reason for his visit. Tian recounted the events in full. His brother said, “Our grandfather tended the incense fire before the Canopy of Hua with utmost reverence—his devotion resounded like a struck chime. In the year of *chou*, he built a grand hall at the site of his scripture-chanting pilgrimage, adorning it with statues of the Three Immortals and naming it Zhaoqing Abbey. It became the most magnificent sight in the county, its halls, chambers, gates, and monastic fields all endowed by our grandfather. Now, he says he dwells daily in the Immortals’ Pavilion of Zhaoqing Abbey—this is the manifest retribution of his meritorious deeds. I suspect his allotted span in the netherworld is complete, and he has returned to be reborn. You should go there and make offerings on his behalf.”

Following his brother’s advice, Tian journeyed directly to Zhaoqing Abbey the next day to perform scripture-chanting rites for his grandfather’s deliverance. At dawn on the twenty-second day of the fifth month, Madam Jia gave birth to a son. On the night of the twenty-third, she dreamed of a purple-robed, long-bearded Daoist wielding a sword, who entered her home to affix talismans and sprinkle consecrated water. In the dream, Madam Jia asked the Daoist, “I gave you money this morning—why have you returned?” The Daoist replied, “I seek no money. Yesterday, I escorted a household here—do you know of this? Do not scold them; instead, cherish them dearly.”

On the fifteenth day of the sixth month, a neighbor brought mutton for Madam Jia to eat. That night, she dreamed of the abbot of Zhaoqing Abbey, Xie, who entered and warned, “Do not let the mutton broth soil the child’s mouth.” With that, he departed. On the night of the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, Madam Jia dreamed of three Daoists entering her home. Two sat upon flower vases, while a purple-robed Daoist strode directly inside, declaring, “We are the Two Immortals of the Hua Canopy. We have come to see your little one, who has cried for two nights—from this night onward, he will cry no more.” Upon waking, the child’s weeping indeed ceased at once.

Upon close reflection, this account reveals the wondrous traces of the Perfected Lords Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo in their sojourns, their transformations vividly manifest. It serves as profound encouragement for those who build halls, erect statues, endow fields, and perform good deeds. Thus, it is recorded here.

**The Efficacy of the Hua Canopy’s Talismans for Warding Off Evil**
The *Talismans for Warding Off Evil*, which I compiled and printed for distribution, have proven effective in eighteen or nineteen out of every ten cases. One day, a scholar named Huang Bin requested a copy to enshrine above the door of his hall. By chance, his wife invited a neighbor to join her in the rear garden to gather plums. Upon returning home, she suddenly grew dizzy and feverish, as if afflicted by an evil spirit. That night, she dreamed of two men begging for food beneath the hall’s eaves, but her husband refused. Someone beside them urged, “Why not go inside to ask?” The men pointed to the talisman above the door and said, “We dare not enter.” Her husband then said, “Stand outside the door, and I will bring you something to eat.” With these words, she awoke from the dream.

The following day, Huang Bin entered the garden and suddenly realized there were two ancient tombs there. He promptly prepared a meal to offer as a sacrifice, and his wife’s condition swiftly improved. Reflecting on this, he thought, *The efficacy of talismans is indeed no falsehood.*

**The Divine Traces of Lord Fuqiu on Dragon Source Mountain and Its Water Spirits**

Dragon Source Mountain lies due south of Chong County. In earlier times, a water spirit dwelled atop the peak, frequently causing floods in spring and summer. When Lord Fuqiu first arrived in Jiangnan, he passed through this region via Military Mountain. Struck by the mountain’s grandeur and the river’s beauty, he toured the area and learned of the spirit’s mischief. He then overturned a bronze bell, declaring, *“From this day forth, you shall never again harm the people.”* This is the origin of the present-day Boiling Lake. Since the bell was overturned, its waters have perpetually seethed. Over time, ignorant villagers, coveting the bell’s value, schemed to retrieve it, but the deeper they dug, the more the earth gave way, and they never succeeded. Recently, some displaced people passed through, and a woman gave birth on the site. The frequent defilement caused the boiling to cease. Should one wish to restore the lake, they must first petition the immortal; otherwise, floods and swarms of hornets will follow.

The mountain also holds a *Money Granary*, where Lord Fuqiu commanded earth spirits to store coins for aiding the poor. Once, a woodcutter stumbled upon the site and saw the stone door ajar. Inside, the coins were countless, with over three hundred scattered on the ground. Unsure how to carry them and fearing discovery, he took only what he could, marking the spot with earth and stones to return by night. When he came back, the stone door had sealed itself. That night, he dreamed of a Daoist who told him, *“These are my provisions for the poor—you must not take them recklessly. I shall reward you for resealing the granary.”*

Atop the mountain stands a stone chamber. When prayers are offered, clouds and mist arise, sometimes forming a circular image. From this mist, a radiance emerges, its hues shifting through five colors. At times, it spans the sky like a rainbow, pointing directly toward Hua Peak, appearing unpredictably.

To the west lies Dragon Pool. In times of drought, prayers and offerings to the mountain’s dragon summon sweet rains in abundance. Below, sheer cliffs rise, their mossy needles glistening as springs and stones reflect one another—a truly wondrous sight.

Beside the altar is a naturally formed stone well called the *Medicinal Well*. Though shallow, its waters never deplete. Lord Fuqiu once dwelled here, using his arts to aid the people.

During the Shaoxing era of the Song, Daoist practitioners unearthed a stone ritual vessel from the temple’s foundation—now used as a *dharma-water basin*. The tiles had already turned to earth, but the characters *“Boiling Lake”* remained inscribed within. Though the site has flourished and declined over a thousand years, its essence endures.

Generally, the mountain’s divine protection is stern. Minor transgressions provoke thunder and lightning, followed by swift retribution. During the Shaoxing era, the recluse Luo Gongzhang and the Daoist Zou Congzhou erected an immortal’s statue. On the night of its completion, three bridges of light appeared, their glow illuminating the sky like crimson arcs. Fragrant breezes filled the air from dusk till dawn. Moved by this, Luo Gong wrote in his memorial: *“Auspicious signs shine with perfect clarity, revealing the constant Way of the numinous. Wondrous lights blaze in awe, their transformations beyond mortal ken. Our reverence finds its home, and our joy knows no bounds. A thousand years’ fading winds revive; the ancient abode of the Three Immortals regains its splendor.”*

Later, those who defiled the site faced celestial disasters—such was the will of the exalted sages to purge the old and renew the sacred. In the Xinhai year of the Shaoxi era, the Daoist Huang Zongyi rallied others to renovate the temple. On the seventh night of the seventh month, the scholar Luo Gong Wuyi, along with locals Huang Zhong, Huang Zhen, and Luo Dounan, strolled the countryside in leisure. Suddenly, they saw three heavenly lamps ascend from the mountain’s scorched peak. By midnight, when they climbed the *Scripture Tower* to observe, the lights numbered nearly a hundred. Thereafter, such apparitions recurred, though usually limited to three, five, or a dozen.

Previously, due to irreverent prayers, the site was twice struck by thunder, leaving the locals too fearful to approach. By the Gengshen year, Luo Gong and the Daoist Huang petitioned the immortals and restored the temple, completing its statues and halls. During the consecration, golden lamps appeared intermittently, and auspicious lights shone brilliantly—so frequently that people grew accustomed and no longer marveled.

That year, in the sixth month, they further renovated the *Processional Statue* for welcoming rituals. The statue was donated by the Daoist Zou Linqing of Huangchuan. At noon on the twenty-third day, a circular image suddenly manifested, its radiance far greater than usual.

The mountain’s height nearly rivals Hua Mountain, and it faces a corresponding peak. At its summit lie sweet springs, lush forests, towering bamboo, and interspersed peach and plum trees. The four lesser cliffs bear stone patterns resembling rippling ice. There are also great and small *Stone Gates*, cleft by immortals wielding swords to carve a path for their ascent. Long ago, a military force passed through and toppled a corner of the site. Three hundred men died under mysterious retribution. Some say this was where the Tang poet Du Fu’s master attained the Dao. The *Elixir-Refining Altar*, well, and other relics remain intact.

**Praying for Rain at Hua Peak**

Hua Peak is a site of daily worship, visited without fail throughout the year. Even in the depths of winter or the height of summer, clouds and mist gather thickly—its customary state. Atop the peak, the weather shifts unpredictably. For the devout, prayers swiftly dispel gloom, and the sun’s chariot ascends.

In recent years, a dispute arose when You Haocheng vowed to ascend the immortal peak to seek blessings for his parents. After his wish was granted, he journeyed to the mountain to give thanks. Delayed by days of rain, he burned incense at his lodging’s hearth and gazed toward the *Three Perfected Ones*, praying for clear skies. The next day, his prayer was answered, and his travels proceeded smoothly.

Amidst his reflections, he composed a poem to commemorate the event:

For ten long days, freezing rain turned roads to mud,
And then the skies unleashed a flurry of snow and sleet.
Yet thanks to the *True Wind* that swept the gloom away,
A thousand peaks now gleam beneath the sun’s bright ray.

Such responsiveness is plain to see.
Whenever one ascends the *Main Altar*, if not even a wisp of cloud arises, the vista stretches a thousand *li* in every direction. From ancient times to the present, renowned scholars and gifted poets have left behind long verses and exquisite lines, inscribing their words upon the mountain’s slopes. Those who read them savor their essence, finding in them a profound and treasured flavor. The mountain’s towering peaks and wondrous scenes remain ever-present, inescapable to the eye.

**Prefectural Governor Sun’s Pilgrimage and Response**
Prefectural Governor Sun, traveling southward on official business, paused at Linchuan on the road to Luling. Hearing of bandit raids between Gao’an and Xin’gan, he briefly stayed at the Daoist shrine on Xianyou Mountain in Chongyi. After some time, he fell slightly ill. He then offered incense, ascended the hall, and bowed twice, seeking a divine response. He also vowed that, once recovered, he would climb to the summit on foot to express his gratitude. Soon after, his prayers were answered in full. Observing a day of fasting and purification, he fearlessly braved the perilous paths, ascending through the clouds and mist. Weariness vanished as if he trod upon level ground. Once his memorial was complete, he surveyed the magnificent scenery and composed a poem before departing:

Through dense mist and lush vines, the climb is steep,
Yet without sedan or chair, I’ve reached the peak.
Beyond the green curtains, the morning crows call,
While I, seeking blessings, stand amid clouds tall.
Before the pavilion, I imagine the phoenix’s trace,
At the cave’s mouth, mossy patterns still grace.
One day, if cinnabar grants me a transformed frame,
I’ll return to seek the Golden Gate’s domain.

**Chen the Ritual Officer’s Mother, Madame Yu, Dreams of the Three Perfected Ones Granting a Bronze Staff and Recovers—Rebuilding the Precious Hall**
In the spring of the *wuwu* year of *Baoyou* (1258), a wildfire swept through Huagai’s sacred mountain, reducing halls, cloisters, and temples to ashes. Not a single tile remained. Though temporary shelters were hastily built to shield against wind and rain, they fell far short of the site’s former grandeur.

In the second month of the *gengshen* year of *Jingding* (1260), Chen Tongzu, the Ritual Officer and son of the late General Chen of Baotang, heard of urgent border alarms and moved his family to Guling Manor. His mother, Madame Yu, had long suffered from a *qi* ailment, and her condition worsened with anxiety over the crisis. In her distress, Chen the Ritual Officer reverently approached the immortal altar, kneeling to beg for sacred water to heal her.

After taking the medicinal elixir, Madame Yu, still in her illness, dimly perceived three Daoist immortals clad in resplendent robes, descending slowly upon colored clouds to her manor. Among them stood a Daoist of noble bearing—his beard full, his cheeks broad—who approached the courtyard and presented her with a pair of bronze rods. He spoke: *"Madame, you have long suffered from this affliction. Now I bestow these rods upon you; your ailment shall soon be eased, and you need worry no more."* With these words, he bowed and departed. Madame Yu at once felt her body lighten, her illness vanishing entirely. A rare fragrance, sweet and lingering, filled the air. She summoned her household and recounted what had transpired, yet none could fathom its meaning.

Thirteen days later, Madame Yu and her son ascended the mountain to give thanks for the sacred water. Upon entering the hall and offering incense, she looked up at the images of the Three Perfected and exclaimed: *"The immortals I saw in my illness were these very beings!"* Thereupon, she arranged a grand ritual feast to express her gratitude before departing. Soon after, she ordered craftsmen to rebuild the Precious Hall, its name plaque, the sacred altar, and the bronze bells and drums—all restored anew, that the Perfected might be venerated therein.

**Zhou Xian of Luling Recounts the Miracles of the Three Perfected**
During the *wuwu* year of *Baoyou* (1258), Zhou Xian of Luling had a family member who, pregnant and fearful, faced a difficult situation. As Zhou prepared to leave on business, he rose early and, with reverence, prayed to the Three Perfected. That night, he dreamed of two feather-robed immortals performing a ritual in his home. Zhou addressed them: *"I have matters to attend to and cannot stay to accompany you. I must go out—what should I do?"* The immortals replied: *"Do not let your duties hinder you. Whatever arises, we two shall manage it."* Upon waking, he received word days later that a son had been born, though the delivery had been arduous.

In the *gengshen* year of *Jingding* (1260), Zhou’s entire household suffered from a painful outbreak of scabies. After praying to the Three Perfected, they once again received a miraculous response. Then, in the spring of the *yichou* year of *Xianchun* (1265), his second son, Wenqing, and his younger son, Wengui, fell gravely ill with smallpox. For days, they neither ate nor rose from their beds, casting the household into deep concern. Zhou lit incense and knelt in prayer to the Three Perfected, beseeching them to spare his sons from harm. That night, his eldest son, Wenqing, dreamed of three Daoist immortals visiting their home. They took his hand, examined him, and declared: *"This illness is no cause for alarm."* Wenqing awoke from the dream. Shortly after, he dreamed again of the same immortals returning to examine him, administering medicine before departing. Within days, his appetite returned, the pox faded without trace, and both sons were restored to life.

To spread these accounts and repay the grace of the Perfected, the records were carved onto woodblocks and placed in the Purple Mystery Grotto.

**The District Magistrate Welcomes the True Immortals of Huagai to Pray for Rain**
In the second month of the *renyin* year of *Chunxi* (1182), the land withered under a prolonged drought, striking fear into the hearts of the people. Magistrate Zhao Yizhong led his officials and the local gentry in welcoming the images of the Three Perfected to the Jade Purity Hall, where they held a ritual feast. Sweet rain fell for days, nourishing the fields far and wide. On the nineteenth day, a radiant glow illuminated the sky, followed by dark clouds and a sudden downpour—neither rainbow nor lightning, yet a spectacle that dazzled all who beheld it. By the first day of the seventh month, the townspeople gathered to perform a grand ritual. As the first offering concluded and the prayer was burned, a dense mist arose, persisting until the fourth watch of the night. That year, the harvest was abundant.

**Volume Six of *Records of the Facts of the Three Perfected Lords of Huagai Mountain: Wang, Fuqiu, and Guo*** concludes.
