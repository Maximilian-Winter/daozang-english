**Volume One: Commentary by Zhao the Scholar**
**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
If it were not the eternal Dao, yet it can be spoken—how can it be eternal?

Now, benevolence (仁), righteousness (义), propriety (礼), and wisdom (智)—these are the Dao that can be spoken.
The Dao that cannot be spoken: benevolence cannot be made into righteousness, propriety cannot be made into wisdom.
The Dao that can be spoken is not eternal #1, yet the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal.
Thus, in benevolence, it is benevolence; in righteousness, it is righteousness; in propriety, it is propriety; in wisdom, it is wisdom.
The Dao that can be spoken is not eternal, yet the Dao itself does not change; the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal, such is its nature.

A name can be named, yet it is not the eternal name.
The Dao cannot be spoken, yet how much more so can it be named?

All names are merely the Dao that can be spoken.
Once names are established, distinctions between round and square, curved and straight, cannot be eternal.

Yanzun (严遵) and Junping (君平) said:
Having a name is not the Dao; not having a name is not the Dao.
Having form is not the Dao; not having form is not the Dao.
Without a name, yet nothing is without a name; without form, yet nothing is without form.
Without a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;
With a name, it is the mother of all things.
Eternal non-being, to observe its subtlety (妙);
Eternal being, to observe its transformations (徼).
From its eternal non-being, form arises as heaven and earth,
Heaven and earth stand, and names begin to be established.
It spreads as all things, all things follow the Dao, yet names cannot exhaust their use—
Thus, the eternal non-being is the essence of the Dao,
And the eternal being is the manifestation of the Dao.

The sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,
Entering all things while remaining in eternal non-being,
To observe its subtlety (妙),
And embodying the utmost non-being while remaining in eternal being,
To observe its transformations (徼).
If one acts only in its transformations and does not know its subtlety,
It is coarse and not profound.
If one drifts only in its subtlety and does not know its transformations,
It is refined yet not practical.

Sima Junshi (司马君实) said:
Call the beginning of heaven and earth "non-being" (无),
Call the mother of all things "being" (有).
Wang Xiu (王秀) said:
Being and non-being share the same essence,
The words "beginning" and "mother" are mere aids to understanding.

Wang Bi (王弼) believed:
"Eternal being" (常有) is to observe its transformations (徼).
If one seeks eternal being, then how could one observe its transformations,
When all things are drowned and lost in the myriad forms?
At the end, there are heaven and earth—who could name them?

Without a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;
With a name, then all things are born—hence, "being" is the mother of all things.
Zhuangzi (庄子) said:
The Old Master (老氏) established eternal non-being,
Not founding any single thing—this is eternal non-being;
Not abandoning any single thing #2—this is eternal being.
Eternal non-being lies in principle (理),
Its heights are not bright—it is the utmost subtlety in the world, hence to observe its subtlety.
Eternal being lies in affairs (事),
Its depths are not dark—it is the utmost transformation in the world, hence to observe its transformations.
To abandon being is to cling to emptiness,
To follow transformations is to forget the root—
Thus, great wisdom observes both.

These two are the same source yet different names,
Both called "profound" (玄).
Speaking in terms of form,
Being and non-being seem to be two.

How do you know that non-being moves to become being,
And being returns to become non-being?
They have never ceased to be one.
Though their names differ, their root is the same—
Knowing that their root is one, then it is profound.

All that is distant yet without ultimate limit,
Its hue must be profound—
Thus, the Old Master (老子) often speaks of "profound" to convey the utmost.

Taiping Guangshi (太平光师) said:
Opposition gives rise to names.
Profound beyond profound, the gateway to all subtleties.
Profound beyond profound again, it reaches its limit—
Yet there remains a mind that knows of the profound.
Profound beyond profound again, it is exhausted—
No further addition can be made,
The gateway through which all subtleties emerge.
Guang (光) said:
To forget the profoundness of the profound, then it is called "profound beyond profound."

Zhao Bingwen (赵秉文) said:
This chapter reveals the ultimate profundity of the "double profound" (重玄),
Not merely that the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao,
Nor that the Dao that cannot be spoken is not the Dao.
Zhuangzi said:
Words and silence are both insufficient to exhaust the Dao—
Not only is the Dao eternally without name,
But even having a name or not having a name is insufficient to exhaust the Dao.

The eternal non-being is the semblance of the Dao.
Eternal non-being is what the Buddhist schools call "true emptiness" (真空);
Eternal being is what the Buddhist schools call "marvelous existence" (妙有).
Both being and non-being are insufficient to exhaust the Dao—
Thus, it is entrusted to the "double profound."

Zhenghe (政和) said:
Profound is the hue of heaven,
The hue that colors all hues is manifest,
Yet the coloring of hues is never displayed.
Profound beyond profound is the coloring of hues.
The profound subtleties of principle,
All things possess them together.
Heaven’s movements, earth’s positions,
Human consciousness, the flourishing of all things—
All are subtleties, yet all emerge from the profound—
Thus, it is called the "gateway to all subtleties."

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness is already present.
When all under heaven know goodness as goodness,
Then non-goodness is already present.

Thus, being and non-being generate each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low depend on each other,
Sounds and voices harmonize each other,
Before and after follow each other.

All under heaven speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name,
Yet what they call "beautiful and good" (美且善),
Is it truly beautiful and good?
They do not know that being and non-being,
Difficulty and ease,
Long and short,
High and low,
Sounds and voices,
Before and after—
All mutually oppose each other,
None of them is their true nature.

Just when one considers oneself long,
There is one longer than me who stands before me—
Then I am short.
Just when one considers oneself foremost,
There is one who comes before me—
Then I am behind.

If one follows what is deemed beautiful and accepts it as true,
Then one will stray far from the Way.

Zhao said:
Being and non-being generate each other—
Just as high must have low,
Thus, though being and non-being differ,
Both ultimately escape not-being.

This speaks of how forms take shape,
Hence, borrowing the expressions of being and non-being to dispel them.

Guang said:
These six pairs are why things are unequal,
Only those who have lost their counterpart can harmonize them.

Zhenghe said:
The Dao has no differing appearances—
Who decides what is beautiful or ugly?
Nature is inherently unified—
Who decides what is good or evil?

There is beauty, and ugliness opposes it,
Thus, it is said: "All under heaven knows beauty as beauty,
Yet ugliness already exists."
There is goodness, and unkindness opposes it,
Thus, it is said: "All under heaven knows goodness as goodness,
Yet unkindness already exists."

Before the Supreme Ultimate was divided,
All phenomena shared a single body.
Once the Two Forces emerged,
All things became paired opposites.

These six pairs arise from myriad transformations,
From a hundred thoughts,
From divergent paths—
The way the world’s people drown and cannot extricate themselves.

Thus, the Sage acts in non-action,
Teaches without speaking.
When acting, the mind is one of non-action;
When teaching, the intent is one of non-speech.

Within proper measure, transcending long and short,
Beyond the sequence of before and after,
Neither beautiful nor ugly,
Neither good nor evil—
Then how could the world truly know it?

Lü Huiqing said:
The Sage acts all day yet never acts,
Speaks all day yet never speaks.
All things act without refusal,
Are born without possession,
Act without reliance,
And upon completion, does not claim.

All things act for me, yet I refuse none.
I give birth to them yet possess nothing,
Rely on nothing.
When their work is done,
I do not claim it as my own.
This is the teaching of non-action and non-speech—
How could ugliness or evil follow such beauty and goodness?

Only by not claiming does one not lose.
The Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without fear of poverty or lowliness;
Dwells in wealth and honor without the burden of wealth and honor—
This is called not claiming.
If I do not claim, how could others take it away?
This is the ultimate dwelling.

Zhenghe said:
All things act in parallel,
Responding to stimuli without refusal.
They shape themselves, transform themselves,
Give birth to themselves, and manifest their own colors—
Who could possess them?

Zhao said:
There is non-action in opposition and true non-action;
There is non-speech in opposition and true non-speech.
Non-action and speech in opposition—
Like the pairs of being and non-being, high and low—what difference is there?
But true non-action and non-speech—
Are those who have lost their counterpart and severed dependence.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**
Not exalting the virtuous prevents the people from striving;
Not treasuring hard-to-obtain goods prevents theft;
Not displaying what is desirable prevents disorder of the heart.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
Empties the mind, fills the belly,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones.

If one exalts the virtuous, the people will be ashamed of not measuring up and thus contend;
If one treasures hard-to-obtain goods, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal;
If one displays what is desirable, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel.

Though all under heaven knows these three as calamities,
If one attempts to abolish them, one will only be confused.
The Sage is not thus.

He has never failed to use the virtuous—
Only he does not exalt them;
He has never abandoned hard-to-obtain goods—
Only he does not treasure them;
He has never removed what is desirable—
Only he does not display them.

Thus, the virtuous are employed yet the people do not contend;
Hard-to-obtain goods and desirable things are present yet theft and chaos do not arise—
Is this not emptying the mind while not harming the belly’s fullness,
Weakening the will while not harming the bones’ strength?

Now, if one were to exalt and promote the virtuous,
Treasure and honor goods,
Display and flaunt what is desirable—
Then both mind and belly would be filled.
If one were to abolish them, then will and bones would weaken.
When mind and belly are filled, the people will not contend;
When will and bones are weakened, no undertaking can stand.

Zhao said:
Emptying the mind and filling the belly—
This means the ruler does not exalt, does not treasure, does not display,
So the people have no knowledge and no desires.
Some say emptying the mind nurtures the Dao,
Though this may be justifiable, it is not the intent of this passage.
Rather, it is to always keep the people without knowledge and desire,
So that even the wise dare not act.

The Sage’s governance aims only to let the people preserve their nature and life.
Excessive knowledge harms the division of nature and life,
Excessive desire wounds the essence of nature and life.
Called "governance" yet what greater chaos could there be?

Thus, always keep the people without knowledge and desire,
Do not deceive them with falsehoods,
Then the people will not yearn for anything,
Their desires will be simple and uncluttered—
Even the wise will have no schemes to employ.

Zhao said:
Without yearning, they dare not act.
Zhenghe said:
The eloquent dare not display their cleverness,
The brave dare not unleash their hostility,
The capable dare not boast of their talents,
The wise dare not apply their insight—
This is called "making the wise dare not act."

Acting in non-action, nothing will remain ungoverned.
Using these three naturally while not exalting, not treasuring, not displaying—
This is called acting in non-action.

Zhenghe said:
The Sage’s governance does not abandon people or reject things,
Nor does it imagine standing alone in a realm of non-action.
It is simply emerging from non-action.

Things have their actions—
Follow them to observe their return;
Things have their births—
Guide them to achieve completion—
How could there be no governance?

**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unobstructed**
The Dao is unobstructed yet used—
Seemingly not full, yet profound,
Like the origin of all things.

The Dao is unobstructed, reaching the utmost non-being,
Yet with it, it adapts to all things—
Though vast as heaven and earth,
Broad as mountains and rivers,
It pervades everywhere without form,
Thus it seems not full.

The depths are profound and boundless—
I know it is the origin of all things,
Yet dare not speak of it directly,
Thus it is called *seemingly* the origin of all things.

Dull its sharpness,
Dissolve its anger,
Blend its brilliance,
Align with the dust—
Calm, as if it might exist.

No one lacks the Dao,
Yet the Sage preserves it whole.
Dull its sharpness, lest it stray into recklessness;
Dissolve its anger, lest it clash with things.
Not straying into recklessness, not clashing with things—
External harm removed, its light emerges,
Yet blending it further, lest it differ from things.
Light is most pure, dust most mixed—
Though dust aligns without distinction,
Lest it abandon all things.
Thus, only when fully preserved does it remain calm,
Though it exists, none recognize it—
Hence, it is called *seemingly* to exist.

**Kaiyuan said:**
The Dao is nowhere absent—
In light, in dust, all is one with it.
One with light and dust, yet its mystery transcends light and dust.

**Wang Bi said:**
Existing yet not possessing,
Vanishing yet not absent—
Being and non-being beyond measure,
Thus it is called *seemingly* to exist.

**Zhenghe said:**
Sharpness brings harm, disorder brings chaos.
Dulling sharpness removes contention,
Dissolving disorder removes strife.
Blending its light—
As Zhuangzi said: *bright yet not dazzling*.
Aligning with dust—
As Zhuangzi said: *yielding with things, riding their waves*.
In the midst of Tai定, heaven’s light shines naturally,
Dull, as if forgotten yet present.
I know not who first gave birth to it—
A precursor to the Emperor.
Though the Dao eternally exists,
None can name it—
Yet it cannot be said to be absent,
Thus: *Is this not the Emperor’s precursor?*
The precursor precedes the Emperor,
Yet none precedes it.

**Zhao said:**
This chapter begins and ends with the Dao—
Dulling sharpness, dissolving disorder,
Blending light, aligning with dust—
The unknowing do not speak of it,
Those embodying it transcend dependence, merging in the Mysterious.
This is not mere conformity with the vulgar.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Without Virtue**

Heaven and Earth are without virtue,
Yet treat all things as sacrificial dogs;
The Sage is without virtue,
Yet treats the people as sacrificial dogs.

Heaven and Earth act without partiality,
Listening to all things’ natural course—
Thus, their birth and death are not my cruelty,
Nor my benevolence.
Like binding straw into a dog,
Set for sacrifice,
Adorned with utmost reverence—
Yet not loved—
It is merely the time’s demand.
When the rites conclude, it is discarded,
Trampled by passersby—
Yet not hated—
Also the time’s demand.

So too the Sage treats the people—
Only ensuring no harm,
Thus the people preserve their nature.
Life and death, gain and loss—
I have no part in them.
Though I never acted benevolently,
Benevolence is vast.

**Zhenghe said:**
Favor arises from harm,
Harm arises from favor.
If virtue is favor, harm follows.
Heaven and Earth toward all things,
The Sage toward the people—
Aiding their natural course,
Without love or gain,
Virtue cannot be named.

Like straw dogs for sacrifice—
Used when fitting, discarded when past,
So too all things’ self-generation,
The people’s self-governance—
How could they demand affection?

Between heaven and earth—
Is it like the bellows and the bellows-key?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing.
Things have bellows and bellows-keys—
When one moves,
Qi flows wherever it reaches,
Yet the unknowing deem it the pinnacle of craft.
But what use are bellows and bellows-keys?
They are empty yet unyielding,
Thus moving yet ever producing.

Between heaven and earth,
Their generation and destruction of all things,
Their carving of myriad forms—
Is no different.

**Zhenghe said:**
The bellows-key is empty yet receptive,
Receptive yet responsive,
Thus responsive without exhaustion.
If filled with substance,
Every touch would obstruct.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to guard the center.
Seeing its motion yet endless,
They know not it is the response of emptiness within—
Thus I tell them: much speech exhausts,
Better to guard the center’s inexhaustibility.

**Lu said:**
All things rely on heaven and earth to live,
Yet heaven and earth take nothing from them;
The people depend on the Sage to govern,
Yet the Sage borrows nothing from them—
Like straw dogs formed by divine offerings,
Yet divine offerings derive no use from them.
Only the unneeding are without partiality,
Without partiality, without favor—
Thus heaven and earth, without favor, yet great favor arises,
The Sage, without virtue, yet great virtue is complete.
Thus the people do not decline the Sage’s virtue,
All things do not thank heaven and earth for life.
How do I know this?
I observe between heaven and earth—
Like the bellows-key’s lack of intent.
The bellows-key lacks intent,
Thus its sound is unyielding,
Its qi ever flowing;
Heaven and Earth lack intent,
Thus generation never ceases;
The Sage lacks intent,
Thus governance never exhausts in speech.
Much speech without substance exhausts—
Not as effective as *wuwei* and silence,
The art of guarding the center.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Feminine, the Valley.
Most empty yet still with form,
The Valley Spirit is empty yet without form.
Empty and without form,
Still without birth—
How could there be death?

Called the Valley Spirit—
Speaking of its virtue;
Called the Mysterious Feminine—
Speaking of its function.
The Feminine gives birth to all things,
Yet is called Mysterious—
For though its birth is seen,
Its *how* of birth is unseen.

**Sun Simiao said:**
The Valley Spirit is empty yet numinous.

**Zhenghe said:**
Form brings rise and decline,
Measure brings completion and ruin.
Form and measure together—
Birth and death are divided,
The nature of things.
The Valley responds to all movement yet remains ever empty,
The Spirit marvels at all things yet remains ever still,
In the eternal True,
One with the Dao.
Not clinging to form,
Not falling into measure,
Generating endlessly without exhaustion—
Thus it is said: *does not die*.

The Valley Spirit as a metaphor for the eternal Dao,
The Mysterious Feminine to reveal the marvel of creation.

The Mysterious Feminine’s gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Mysterious Feminine’s gate—
All things arise from here,
Heaven and Earth’s root—
From here they spring.

Endless and subtle, as if it exists,
Yet used without effort.
Endless—
Soft yet never ceasing,
As if it exists—
Existing yet unseen.

If one could be thus,
Even if used all day, it would never weary.

**Wang Bi said:**
Would you say it exists?
Its form is unseen.
Would you say it perishes?
All things arise from it.
Thus it is endless and as if it exists,
Without it nothing is formed,
Yet its use is effortless—
Hence it is said: *without effort*.

**Zhao said:**
This chapter speaks of the Dao’s effortless, formless nature,
Giving birth to Heaven and Earth,
Ever fixed since ancient times.
River Master likens the Mysterious Feminine to mouth and nose,
Yet those who nurture life still revere it—
How small his understanding!

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**
Heaven and Earth, though vast,
Are bound by form and measure,
So their endurance is limited.

Yet Laozi says their endurance reaches Heaven and Earth—
He speaks only of what people perceive.
But the supreme endurance is what is called
The root of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth endure so long
Because they do not generate themselves,
Thus they endure eternally.

Therefore, the Sage yields his own life yet comes first,
Sets his own life aside yet preserves it.
Is this not because he has no selfishness?
Hence his selfishness is fulfilled.
Heaven and Earth give birth to all things yet do not generate themselves,
Standing beyond all things.
Thus they endure eternally.
The Sage yields his own life yet comes before others,
Sets his own life aside yet benefits others,
Standing apart from the crowd,
Thus he comes first and is preserved.

If Heaven and Earth competed with things to generate,
And the Sage contended with people for gain,
Then Heaven and Earth would be but one thing,
And the Sage but one person—
How could they surpass all others?

Though he has no selfishness,
It is not to seek selfishness’ fulfillment,
Yet selfishness is fulfilled through him.
The Dao is simply thus.

**Jiuji said:**
The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Yielding his own life, setting it aside,
As Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves,
His life comes first, is preserved,
As Heaven and Earth endure eternally.
Yielding his own life—
He places himself below others,
Thus his life comes first.
Setting his own life aside—
Others protect him,
Thus his life is preserved.

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**
The supreme good is like water,
Water benefits all things yet does not contend,
Dwelling where people revile—
Thus it nears the Dao.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
One yin, one yang—
This is called the Dao,
The continuation of it is virtue,
The fulfillment of it is nature.

Again it says:
Heaven’s One generates water.
The Dao manifests as virtue,
Like *qi* forming water—
Hence the supreme good is like water.

Both arise from the formless and achieve form,
Thus their principles are the same.

The Dao is present everywhere,
Benefits all things—
Water does likewise.
Yet once it clings to form,
It diverges from the Dao,
Hence it is said: *it nears the Dao*.
Yet among named virtues,
None surpass this—
Hence the supreme good.

Dwelling in virtue’s ground,
Mind in virtue’s depths,
Aligned with virtue’s benevolence,
Speech in virtue’s trust,
Governance in virtue’s order,
Actions in virtue’s skill,
Movements in virtue’s timing.

Avoiding heights, seeking lows,
Never acting against nature—
This is virtue’s ground.
Empty, still, profound—
Fathomless depths—
This is virtue’s mind.
Benefiting all things,
Giving without seeking return—
This is virtue’s benevolence.
When confined, it turns—
When straight, it bends—
When blocked, it stops—
When released, it flows—
This is virtue’s trust.
Washing clean all impurities,
Balancing high and low—
This is virtue’s order.
Meeting things, it takes their form,
Yet does not linger—
This is virtue’s skill.
In winter it congeals,
In spring it thaws—
In drought it recedes,
In flood it swells,
Never losing its rhythm—
This is virtue’s timing.

Only because it does not contend,
It has no grievances.
If virtue exists yet is not spared,
It is because of contention.
Water does not contend,
Yet possesses seven virtues,
And has no grievances.

**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling**
Holding yet filling—
Better than its fullness.
Grasping yet sharpening—
Cannot long endure.

Knowing fullness must overflow,
And holding it firm,
Better than letting it not fill.
Knowing sharpness must break,
And grasping it first,
Yet knowing grasping cannot ensure safety.

If the Sage has yet does not hold,
How could there be fullness?
Following principle then acting,
How could there be sharpness?

No fullness means no need for holding,
No sharpness means no need for grasping.

**Zhenghe said:**
Holding fullness to prevent overflow,
Yet filling it—
This invites greater overflow,
Thus its nature must decline.
If one wishes to avoid overflow,
Better to avoid fullness entirely.
Grasping to fear loss,
Yet sharpening it—
This invites greater loss.
If one wishes to avoid loss,
Better to avoid sharpening entirely.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them.
Riches and honor bring arrogance,
Thus one invites his own blame.

When achievement is complete,
Name is secured,
Retire—
This is Heaven’s Way.
Midday sun must move,
Full moon must wane—
The rhythm of the four seasons,
Achievers depart.
Heaven and Earth do this—
How much more so for people?

**Zhenghe said:**
He who hoards gold and jade
Is burdened by things,
Burdened by things—
How could he avoid loss?
Thus none can guard them.
Riches and honor bring arrogance,
Harming his virtue,
Harmed in virtue—
How could he escape misfortune?
Thus he invites his own blame.

**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Vital Essence**
Carrying the vital essence,
Embracing the One—
Could it avoid separation?

The vital essence differs from the spirit,
For the vital essence is material,
The spirit is divine.
*The Classic of Changes* says:
Essence and *qi* form things,
The wandering spirit brings change—
Thus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.

The vital essence is material,
Thus it is mixed and fixed;
The spirit is divine,
Thus it is singular and ever-changing.
Called the vital essence—
This speaks of its fixation.
The Dao is present everywhere,
In humans it is nature,
And nature’s subtlety is the spirit.

「Speaking of its purity and unadulteration, we call it *One*;
Speaking of its gathering and undissipation, we call it *Pu* (uncarved).
Both return to the Dao,
Each following its own inherent truth.

The sage’s nature is steadfast,
His spirit is concentrated,
Not swayed by things.
Though he takes the *arc* (vital essence) as his dwelling,
When his spirit wishes to move,
The *arc* follows without fail—
Thus his spirit is always carried by the *arc*.

The common folk are enslaved by things,
Their spirit is dull and ungoverned,
Thus their spirit is subject to the *arc*.

The ears and eyes are burdened by sounds and colors,
The mouth and nose labor over smells and tastes;
When the *arc* wishes to move,
The spirit follows—
Thus the *arc* is always embraced by the spirit.

Therefore, he is taught to embrace the spirit and carry the *arc*,
So that the two never separate—
This is indeed the essential method of the sage’s self-cultivation.

As for the ancient *true person* (真人),
With deep roots and firm foundations,
The Dao of longevity and enduring vision—
It is the same.

Lu said: *"Arc"* is the beginning of speech.
Zhenghe said: The *arc* is yin.
Residing in the body with fixed purpose,
Thus Laozi spoke of the *arc* as "vital essence."

The spirit is yang.
Supported by *qi* yet unbound in its movement,
Thus *The Classic of Changes* spoke of the spirit as "wandering."

The sage governs his form with the spirit,
And controls the *arc* with the spirit—
Thus the spirit is always carried by the spirit,
And never by the *arc*.

Heaven’s One generates water,
Which in things becomes essence;
Earth’s Two generates fire,
Which in things becomes spirit.
Spirit and essence arise from the Dao,
The form is born from essence;
Guarding them without loss,
And uniting them with the spirit—
Then essence and spirit coalesce without admixture.

With essence to gather the spirit,
With the spirit to direct the form,
With the form to sustain the spirit—
Essence complete yet undiminished,
Spirit active yet not overbearing,
Form alive yet not exhausted—
Like the sun and moon adorned upon heaven,
Like grasses and trees adorned upon earth,
Never once separating.

Concentrating *qi* to attain softness,
Could one achieve the state of an infant?
If the spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered,
The strong delight in contention,
The weak delight in fear,
Unaware of themselves.

If the spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly,
Joy and anger follow their proper kinds—
This is called concentrating *qi*.

The spirit is the utmost of emptiness,
*Qi* is the beginning of substance;
The extreme of emptiness is softness,
The extreme of substance is hardness.
Pure nature without *qi* is called attaining softness—
The infant knows no good or evil,
Thus his nature is complete.

Nature complete yet *qi* subtle,
*Qi* subtle yet the body soft—
Concentrating *qi* to attain softness,
To achieve the state of an infant is the pinnacle.

Zhenghe said: Stillness without admixture is called concentration,
Harmony without excess is called softness.

The infant at rest does not know his actions,
In motion does not know his destination,
Holding no judgments of right or wrong, good or evil—
Thus his *qi* is concentrated and softness attained.

Mencius said: Stumbling, rushing—
This is *qi*.
Yet if the heart is moved against it,
The heart cannot concentrate *qi*—
Then *qi* has the irregularity of stumbling and rushing,
And the heart reaches the point of being moved.
When moved, it cannot be restrained.

The sage empties himself to wander in the world,
His heart does not force *qi* to act—
Thus his stillness is without admixture,
His harmony is without excess,
And what difference is there between him and the infant?
Hence it is said: Could one achieve the state of an infant?

Purification and boundless vision,
Could one avoid deception?
The sage externally is not carried by the *arc*,
Internally is not directed by *qi*—
Thus his purification of dust and filth is complete.

Then his spirit is vast and boundless,
Knowing all things arise from nature,
Equally observing the pure and the impure without bias or deception.
Purifying all actions yet not possessing them,
Boundless vision of subtle principles yet silently recognizing them.

Loving the people and governing the state,
Could one avoid action?
Having already cultivated the self,
He extends this further to all people—
Even reaching the point of loving the people and governing the state,
He meets them all with a heart of non-action.

If he were to act with a heart,
Then loving the people would harm them,
And governing the state would disrupt it.

The opening and closing of the heavenly gates,
Could one act as the female?
The heavenly gates are the source of order and chaos, decay and flourishing.
Having already entrusted oneself to the world,
In the intervals of opening and closing,
The common folk value gain and fear loss,
Thus they act in advance to seek fortune.

The sage follows principle to know the mandate of Heaven,
Thus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
"Act before Heaven and Heaven will not oppose you—
This is not acting before Heaven;
Act after Heaven and follow the timing of Heaven—
This is not acting after Heaven."
It speaks of acting before or after,
Always aligning with the mandate of Heaven.

Otherwise, acting before Heaven would be too early,
Acting after Heaven would be too late—
Both would be mistaken.

Thus, what is called "acting as the female"
Is also nothing but not losing the proper time.

Zhenghe said: Knowing the male, guarding the female,
This is the valley of the world.

Clear and all-encompassing,
Could one avoid knowing?
Internally cultivating the self,
Externally governing the state—
Even reaching the point of facing changes,
There is no action without method—
Is this not the clarity and all-encompassing nature of the heart?

The heart is singular—
If there is again a heart that knows,
Then this is twofold.
From singularity to duality,
Bias begins here,
And foolishness takes root.

Now, the mirror’s relation to things—
When they come, it responds—
And yet, how could it know the things that respond to it?
The source is without knowing,
Yet if knowing is added by intention,
This is the origin of falsehood.

Zhenghe said: Bright wisdom and sagely intelligence,
Guarded by them with foolishness.

Nurturing and storing life,
Nurturing without possessing,
Acting without relying,
Growing without controlling—
This is called *mysterious virtue* (玄德).

Its Dao suffices to nurture and store all things,
Yet it does not possess, rely, or control them.
Though it has great virtue,
Things know it not—
Thus it is called *mysterious virtue*.

Wang Pan said: This chapter exhausts the sequence of self-cultivation,
From the scholar to the attainment of entering sainthood through bodily refinement.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes Share One Hub**
The thirty spokes converge at one hub;
When there is nothing in the hub,
There is the utility of the wheel—」

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**
When clay is shaped into vessels,
It is their emptiness that gives them use.
When doors and windows are carved for a house,
It is their emptiness that gives it use.
Thus, having is for utility,
But emptiness is for function.

Exhausting knowledge to craft vessels,
Their use lies always in their emptiness.
Without emptiness, there is no use—
Without use, there is no utility.
Thus, the Sage observes the mysterious through emptiness,
And observes the ordinary through having.
To know these two as one, indivisible,
Is to attain the utmost.

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate.
To see colors, hear sounds, taste flavors—
Their origin lies in nature itself,
Yet no thing exists in them.
This is the utmost.

But when the eyes cling to the five colors,
The ears to the five tones,
The mouth to the five flavors,
And they lose their original nature,
Then though they see, they are truly blind;
Though they hear, they are truly deaf;
Though they taste, they are truly dull.

**Luóshì** said:
If one does not know the emptiness of form and sound,
How is it different from blindness and deafness?

Hunting and chasing game drives the mind to madness,
Rare treasures cause one to act recklessly.
Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes.
Hence, he discards the former and takes the latter.

The Sage’s seeing of colors, hearing of sounds, and tasting of flavors
Are the same as others’.
Yet when it comes to hunting and chasing game,
He never does so,
And when it comes to rare treasures,
He never uses them.

Yet people consider this a disease,
While the Sage alone considers it a blessing.
Why so?

The Sage nourishes the belly, while the common man nourishes the eyes.
The eyes are greedy and cannot receive,
But the belly receives without greed.

External things come from without,
While nature solidifies within.

**Lù** said:
Nourishing the belly means knowing contentment,
Not nourishing the eyes means not seeing what is desirable.

---

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**
Honor and humiliation are like sudden shocks,
Great calamities are like the body itself.

The ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor as by humiliation,
Knowing that honor is the root of humiliation.
They valued the body as they valued great calamities,
Knowing that the body is the root of calamity.

Thus, they abandoned honor and humiliation did not reach them,
They forgot the body and calamity did not come.

What is meant by honor and humiliation?
Honor is low—
To gain it is like a shock,
To lose it is like a shock—
This is called *honor and humiliation as shocks*.

Honor and humiliation are not two things.
Humiliation arises from honor, yet the world does not realize it.
Those who consider honor superior and humiliation inferior
Are all mistaken.

If one knows that humiliation arises from honor,
Then honor is indeed low.

Thus, the ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor,
Never resting in honor while fearing humiliation.
What is meant by *shocks*?
Not true shock—
Only the appearance of shock.

**Guāng** said:
Only when the emotions of the common and the Sage are exhausted
Is there no shock.

What is meant by *valuing great calamity as the body*?
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body.
When I have no body,
What calamity do I have?

*Noble* means *difficult*.
The body is the root of great calamity,
Yet scholars of the world find it difficult to endure great calamity,
But not difficult to have a body.

Thus, the Sage guides them to find difficulty in having a body,
Knowing that when having a body is difficult,
Great calamity departs.

Nature, in relation to man,
Cannot be increased by life or diminished by death.
Its vastness can fill heaven and earth,
Its subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—
No thing can harm it.

Yet the world suffers from losing its original nature,
And only values the body.
Seeing the depth of love for the body,
Things begin to harm it.

The changes of life and death, sickness and health
Assail from within,
The changes of honor and humiliation, gain and loss
Assail from without—
There is not a single thing that is not calamity.

Only the enlightened know that nature cannot be destroyed,
And that the body is not real.
Suddenly forgetting the body,
All the world’s calamities vanish,
Then one can traverse the world without burden.

**Zhào** said:
Zhào said that the greatest calamity is having a body,
Thus, annihilating the body to return to non-being—
This is the realm of the Two Vehicles.

Those who discuss the Dao take
Not being shocked by honor and humiliation,
Abandoning the body and extinguishing wisdom
As the ultimate standard.
How could they know the Sage’s true intent?

**Zhènghé** said:
To grasp power and authority,
To monopolize rewards and punishments,
To create blessings and threats—
The world fears them like deities,
Reveres them like Heavenly Sovereigns—
This is called *noble*.

The Sage does not burden himself with nobility,
Thus he can long preserve nobility without calamity.

It is like the human body:
Falling into limbs, losing clarity,
Separating from form, abandoning wisdom,
Uniting with the Great Harmony—
Then there is nowhere one does not find oneself at ease.

The world’s people exchange nature for things,
Thus they are burdened by things and forget their power;
They burden the mind with the body,
Thus they lose the mind and cannot forget the body—
Their calamity is great.

Even death and life are great,
Yet they bring no change to oneself.
How much more so with the gains and losses of fortune and misfortune!

This is why the ancient Perfect Ones
Did not burden the form with advantage,
Did not burden the mind with the body,
And when viewing all things with themselves,
They could find no choice—
Then the body was not their own.

Above, they played with the Creator,
Below, they made companions of those beyond life and death,
Beyond beginning and end—
What calamity could I have?

Honor is what the world esteems,
Yet they consider it humiliation;
Nobility is what people desire,
Yet they consider it calamity.

Truly, external things are unreliable—
This is the natural order.

If one truly possesses them with non-possession,
Then though honored, there is no humiliation,
Though noble, there is no calamity.

Thus, to value the body for the world
Is like being able to entrust the world;
To love the body for the world
Is like being able to commit the world to it.

Men pursue power and wealth,
Drown in riches and nobility,
And risk danger without regret—
They wish only to enrich the body.

Now, if one bestows the world upon them as a salary,
And burdens them with the responsibility of the body,
Then their forgetting of the body will be complete.

Thus, if one entrusts the world to them as such,
Even the vastness of the world cannot weary them.

Governance in harmony with the Dao states:
The world is a great vessel—
Only the Dao can set it in motion;
The world is a divine vessel—
Only the Dao can hold it fast.

The Sage embodies the Dao,
So in yielding to the world, the world finds joy in being led
And never tires of it.

Those who follow, knowing their own worth,
Yet do not degrade themselves to serve things,
Can be entrusted with the world—
Knowing their love for the body,
Yet do not harm themselves in its constraints,
Can be relied upon with the world.

Thus it is said:
The true Dao begins with cultivating oneself,
Its threads extend to governing the state,
And its roots reach to ruling the world.

Yet the world’s so-called gentlemen
Endanger their bodies and abandon their lives
To chase after things—
Is this not tragic?

Guang states:
Things are a burden to the body,
The body is a burden to the Dao.
To forget things is to preserve the body,
To forget the body is to fulfill the Dao.

Though they forget external encumbrances,
Their love for nobility and worth still remains—
They can be entrusted and relied upon.

When both body and things are forgotten,
And one takes the Dao upon themselves,
They contain the world within the world.

Zhao states:
If one treats the world’s burdens as their own,
Then they forget nobility and worth,
And thus can be entrusted and relied upon to govern the world.

The ancient Sages,
Though seated in the honored position of the ruler,
Saw themselves as mountain forest hermits,
Unmoved by sounds and colors, riches and nobility—
Then the world could not burden them.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**
What is unseen when viewed is called *Yi* (平),
What is unheard when listened to is called *Xi* (希),
What is untouched when grasped is called *Wei* (微).

These three cannot be summoned or invited,
So they merge and become one.

What is seen when viewed is color.
Yet what allows color to be seen
Is the unseen itself.

What is heard when listened to is sound.
Yet what allows sound to be heard
Is the unheard itself.

What is obtained when grasped is touch.
Yet what allows touch to be obtained
Is the untouchable itself.

Though wise men cannot question these three,
They must merge and return to one
Before it can be so.

This so-called "one" is *Xing* (性),
And the three are its manifestations.

Man begins with *Xing* alone—
Yet when it entangles with things,
It splits and scatters,
Becoming sight, hearing, and touch.
They use it daily without reflecting on its source,
And when it merges back into one,
They grow ever more distant from it.

If one extends this further,
Then the Buddha’s teaching on the six senses is the same.
The *Shoulengyan* Sutra says:
*"Reverse the flow to attain oneness—
The six functions then cease."*

This is what is meant.

Zhao states:
*"Yi"* (平), *"Xi"* (希), *"Wei"* (微), *"Yi"* (一)—
All are strong names for the Dao.

The Dao’s subtle essence
Confounds the mind and cannot be known,
Silences the tongue and cannot be spoken—
How could it be perceived through sight, hearing, or touch?

Common men see only color,
Hear only sound—
This is not true knowing.

If one attains the seeing of the unseen,
And sees not with the eyes but with the ears;
If one attains the hearing of the unheard,
And hears not with the ears but with the eyes—
Then the eyes become like ears,
The ears become like noses,
And the six senses intermingle—
This is Zhuangzi’s *Qi-ting* (气听),
And Liezi’s *Shi-ting* (视听).

Without relying on ears and eyes,
They merge and become one.

Above, it does not blaze,
Below, it does not fade.

All things with form
Are adorned by yin and yang,
So their brilliance above and dimness below cannot be evaded.

Yet the Dao,
Though present above, does not blaze,
Though present below, does not fade—
It cannot be traced through forms or numbers.

Lu states:
*"Above, it shines like the sun and moon—
Its light does not blaze;
Below, it rests like tiles and rubble—
Its clarity does not fade."*

Continuous without end—
It cannot be named.
Continuous, it runs without cessation.

Men see its ceaseless motion,
And assume there must be a thing—
Yet they do not know it ultimately returns to nothingness.

This is called the form of the formless,
The image of the imageless—
The *Huanghuang* (惚恍).

The form of its manifestation,
The image of its subtlety—
The formless form, the imageless image—
None of these are truly without.

The named "having" and "not having" cannot be defined—
This is called *Huanghuang* (惚恍).

Lu states:
*"Continuously running without cessation,
It cannot be named—
Though it undergoes myriad transformations,
It ultimately returns to nothingness.
Yet the Dao’s true essence is refined,
Not truly without substance—
But it cannot be grasped by sight, hearing, or touch,
So it is called the form of the formless,
The image of the shapeless.
When spoken of as form, it seems vague as nothingness,
When spoken of as image, it seems indistinct as somethingness."*

To confront it, one does not see its beginning,
To follow it, one does not see its end.

The Dao is present everywhere—
Thus there is no beginning or end to be seen.

Lu states:
*"Its origin is unknown,
So one does not see its beginning;
Its conclusion is unfathomable,
So one does not see its end."*

To hold the ancient Dao
And use it to govern the present.

If one knows the ancient beginning,
This is called the Dao’s thread.

The ancient is where things originate,
The present is where things exist—
Thus the ancient is the "not having" of things,
And the present is the "having" of things.

To hold that from which they originate,
Then their advance and retreat, their swiftness and slowness,
Are all within oneself.

Lu states:
*"Only those who hold the ancient Dao of non-action
And wield it against the present’s pretenses of action
Can return to purity and simplicity,
And restore themselves to the initial state of the ancient past.
To know the ancient purity and simplicity,
This is the great Dao’s framework."*

Lü states:
*"This so-called 'ancient' is not different from the present—
It is the knowing of the ancient’s origin.
This so-called 'present' is not different from the ancient—
It is the knowing of the present’s source.
If one truly knows the ancient’s origin,
Then one knows the present’s source—
The beginning has no origin,
The source has no source—
This is called the thread of the boundless Dao."*

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Art of the True Gentleman**
The ancient true gentleman
Was subtle, profound, and mysterious—
Deep beyond recognition.

Coarse and yet subtle,
Subtle and yet profound,
Profound and yet mysterious—
When mysterious, he was boundless in his understanding,
Yet deep beyond recognition.

The True Gentleman’s Conduct

Since it is beyond recognition,
He must feign its outward form:
Cautious as one crossing a winter river—
Alert before moving, this is called *yú* (豫).
What he wishes to do,
He responds as if compelled,
Cautious as one crossing a winter river,
Hesitant as if unavoidable—this is called *yóu* (犹).
What he does not wish to do,
He delays and resists,
Hesitant as if fearing his neighbors’ gaze—this is called *yóu* (犹).
Solemn as if adorned,
Respectful in all things,
Never failing in decorum—this is called *yǎn* (俨).
Dissolved as ice about to melt,
Knowing all things arise from illusion,
Never clinging to anything—this is called *huàn* (涣).

**Zhènghé says:**
*"Water congeals into ice, ice melts back into water—
In essence, they are one.
Those who cling to one aspect are like water congealed,
Those who harmonize with the whole are like ice released."*

**Dun (敦):**
Thick as uncarved wood—
When all artifice is exhausted,
He returns to his true nature.

**Zhènghé says:**
*"Dun means the utmost depth.
Nature is inherently profound,
Like uncarved wood before it becomes a vessel."*

**Kuàng (旷):**
Vast as a valley—
Empty yet receptive to all.

**Zhènghé says:**
*"Kuàng means the utmost breadth.
The heart’s source is boundless,
Like a valley’s emptiness,
Receiving and responding."*

**Hún (浑):**
Turbulent as mud—
Dull his light,
Blended with dust,
Not differing from things.

Who can clarify mud by stillness?
Who can bring life by motion?
Common men are drowned by things,
Their nature muddied, never cleansed.
Emaciated men cling to stillness,
Their nature stilled, never revived.

Now knowing mud obscures the nature,
He stills it—stillness brings clarity.
Knowing annihilation harms the Dao,
He moves it—motion brings vitality.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Motionless yet responsive,
Sensing and thus harmonizing with all things—
This is the way."*

Those who uphold this Dao
Do not seek fullness.
Fullness arises from excess,
Muddy and unable to clarify,
Stilled and unable to revive—
This is fullness.

Only by not being full
Can one avoid the flaw of newness.
All things decay—
Only by not being full
Does decay not bring renewal.

**Pán says:**
*"The enlightened one
Clarifies mud through enduring stillness,
Revives vitality through enduring motion,
And does not seek fullness—
Thus, no flaw of newness arises."*

---
**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter of Attaining Ultimate Emptiness**

Attain ultimate emptiness,
Guard steadfast stillness.

If emptiness is not ultimate,
There remains something unvanquished.
If stillness is not steadfast,
Movement persists.

Though hills and mountains recede,
Dust particles remain—
This is not ultimate or steadfast.

To *attain* emptiness while *storing* emptiness
Is still not free of substance.
To *guard* stillness while *storing* stillness
Is still entangled in movement—
How much more so for others?

It is difficult to demand the use of emptiness and stillness
Without attaining their extremes.

**Guāng says:**
*"Emptiness is a state of dependence.
To attain ultimate emptiness is to sever dependence—
Severing dependence means being empty even amid substance."*

*"Stillness is the counterpart of movement.
To guard steadfast stillness is to eliminate its counterpart—
Eliminating the counterpart means being still even amid movement.
Thus, without attaining emptiness and stillness,
One cannot illuminate the Dao."*

**Zhènghé says:**
*"Emptiness suffices to receive all things,
Stillness suffices to respond to all movement.
To attain emptiness while grasping its reality,
To guard stillness until it is steadfast—
Then though myriad forms arise,
My heart remains ever clear;
Though myriad changes occur,
My heart remains ever tranquil—
This is called *heavenly harmony*."*

All things arise together,
I observe their return.

With ultimate emptiness and steadfast stillness,
I observe the transformations of all things,
Thus not being disturbed by change.

Knowing all arising must return,
If I were now also to act with all things,
I could not comprehend it.

**Guāng says:**
*"Before things arise, there is no thing.
Things arise from the non-arising and act together."*

**Lù says:**
*"Thunder originates within the earth—
This is the return of heaven and earth;
Movement arises within stillness—
This is the return of the Sage."*

**Zhènghé says:**
*"Things’ generation
Has a source in their sprouting,
And an end in their return.
When they act together,
They trend toward the path of movement’s emergence,
I observe the stillness of those in motion,
The return of those who emerge,
And thus perceive the heart of heaven and earth—
Interacting with things yet not transforming with them,
This is called observing their return."*

All things, myriad and confused,
Each return to their root.
All things arise from nature,
All things return to nature—
Like flowers and leaves growing from a root and returning to it,
Like waves and tides arising from water and returning to it.

**Guāng says:**
*"All things, myriad and confused,
Like water forming waves.
Each returns to its root,
Like waves returning to water."*

Returning to the root is stillness—
If one cannot spontaneously return to nature,
Even halting movement and ceasing thought to seek stillness
Is not stillness.

Only by returning to the root
Is stillness attained.

**Guāng says:**
*"The Dao is the root of movement and stillness.
The root is neither movement nor stillness—
Neither movement nor stillness is the utmost stillness."*

Stillness is called returning to the *Ming* (命).
*Ming* is the subtlest aspect of nature.
Nature can be spoken of,
But *Ming* transcends speech.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"Exhaust reason, fulfill nature, and reach *Ming*."*

The Sage’s study of the Dao
Must begin with exhausting reason,
Proceed with fulfilling nature,
And end with returning to *Ming*.

Ritual, music, propriety, and benevolence—
These are the Sage’s means of interacting with things.
But the use of these seven—
Must know their *why*.

Not knowing their *why*,
One follows their names mechanically—
This is the common man.
Knowing their *why* before acting—
This is the gentleman—
This is called exhausting reason.

Though one exhausts the heart to exhaust reason,
Only then does one attain it.
Without seeking, one does not obtain it.

Things press forward daily,
One must seek before responding—
Then effort is labored,
And achievement is slight.

The Sage is not obscured by externals,
His nature serene—
Without striving, he is correct;
Without thinking, he attains;
Things arrive, and he responds—
This is called fulfilling nature.

Though this is my very nature,
Yet there remains the distinction between self and other—
Then one is nearly deluded.

The ruler’s decree is called *Ming*,
Heaven’s decree is called *Ming*—
To interact with things through nature while unaware of its being mine,
Is to entrust it to *Ming*—
This is called **restoring *Ming***.

**Restoring *Ming*** is called **constancy**.
When it manifests,
Even the vastness of Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—
Nothing remains unaltered or uncorrupted.
Yet **constancy** lies only in restoring to nature,
And thus remains serene and eternally present.

Knowing **constancy** is called **clarity**.
If one does not take restoring nature as **clarity**,
Then all is merely the common man’s cleverness—
Though he may claim **clarity**, it is not true **clarity**.

Not knowing **constancy** leads to reckless action and disaster.
Not knowing to restore nature means being moved by things—
Without action, there is no disaster,
Though one may gain in the moment,
One loses in the long run.

Knowing **constancy** is **tolerance**.
When lost in delusion,
One insists on being right and others wrong—
All things become my enemies—
How can I tolerate them?
If one knows all is delusion,
Even enemies will be pitied and spared—
How then could there be anything I would not tolerate?

**Tolerance** is **impartiality**.
Without limits to tolerance,
The distinction between self and other vanishes—
And who then remains to be partial?

**Impartiality** is **sovereignty**.
Without limits to impartiality,
The world will turn and rally to it.

**Sovereignty** is **Heaven**.
Without limits to embrace,
Even Heaven cannot surpass it.

**Heaven** is **Dao**.
Heaven still has form—
But **Dao** reaches its utmost.

Yet even **Dao** cannot advance beyond this.

**Dao** is **enduring**—
Lifelong without peril.

*Zhenghe* says: **Dao** is unspoiled through ten thousand ages.
Zhao says: This chapter speaks of returning to the root, restoring *Ming*, and taking emptiness and stillness as the foundation.

The *Laozi*’s *Ming* is the *Buddha’s* *xìng*.
Only *xìng* is constant, without birth or death.
Knowing *xìng* brings tolerance and impartiality.

The vulgar cling to prolonging life as *Ming*—
This is what Zhuangzi called the deluded schemer who kills the heart.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Dao**
The Supreme Dao—
The lower knows it exists,

「**Dao** resides in yielding to the world,
Yet never governs it—
The people do not know its workings,
So they only know it exists.

The next level embraces and praises it,
Using *virtue* and *righteousness* to govern the world—
Its *power* can be cherished,
Its deeds are visible—
Thus the people come to love and revere it.
Though its name is fair,
Its *thickness* and *thinness* begin here.

The next level fears and scorns it—
Using laws to discipline the people,
Yet the people are not without fear—
Where their strength cannot reach,
They scorn it.

Trust is insufficient, so there is distrust.
If I truly trust myself,
Then governing the world with **Dao** is enough.
But if I do not trust myself,
And add *virtue* and *righteousness*,
And burden it with laws and governance,
Then the people will begin to distrust.

Even so, they value words—
When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
The people say of me: *"This is natural."*

The Sage trusts abundantly—
In matters of speech,
He still prizes it, yet does not lightly utter words,
And so the people trust him.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
The people daily drift toward goodness and away from crime,
Yet they do not know it themselves.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao is Discarded**
The Great Dao discards *virtue* and *righteousness*;
When the Great Dao flourishes,
*Virtue* and *righteousness* arise within it,
Yet the people do not know it.
Once **Dao** is discarded,
Then *virtue* and *righteousness* appear.

*Wisdom* and *cleverness* emerge, so great falsehood arises;
The world does not know that **Dao** suffices to nourish all things,
Yet they add *wisdom* and *cleverness* to it,
And so the people begin to repay with falsehood.

The six bonds of kinship are disunited, yet there is filial *virtue* and kindness;
The state is in chaos, yet loyal ministers arise.
When the six bonds of kinship are united,
Who is not filial and kind?
When the state is well-ordered,
Who is not a loyal minister?
Yao was not unfilial,
Yet he alone praised Shun—
There was no blind father.
I Yin and Duke Zhou were not disloyal,
Yet they alone praised Longfeng and Bi Gan—
There were no tyrants like Jie and Zhou.
The fish of a dried marsh,
Mutually warm each other with their breath,
Mutually moisten each other with their dampness—
Not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**
Discard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—
The people benefit a hundredfold;
It is not that *wisdom* is insufficient to know **Dao**,
But if the Sage and *wisdom* govern the world,
Who would not use **Dao** to rule things?
The people of the world are insufficient to know the root of *wisdom*,
Yet they see its superficial aspects,
And take it for cleverness in overcoming things—
Thus they rush about in its shallows,
And the people begin to suffer its harm.

Therefore, discard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—
The people benefit a hundredfold.
Discard *virtue* and *righteousness*—
The people return to filial *virtue* and kindness;
There has never been one who practices *virtue* yet forsakes their parents,
Nor one who upholds *righteousness* yet places their ruler after themselves.
*Virtue* and *righteousness* are the means to filial *virtue* and kindness,
But when they decline,
They steal the name of *virtue* and *righteousness*
To seek advantage in the world—
Then sons defy fathers,
Fathers cruelly oppress sons—
This is the work of *virtue* and *righteousness*’s traces,
Hence the saying.

Discard cleverness, abandon profit—
Then thieves and robbers will cease.
Cleverness is used to facilitate affairs,
Profit is used to aid things—
These two are not meant for thieves,
Yet if thieves and robbers cannot act,
Then they will not arise,
Hence the saying.

These three—
If they are insufficient as adornments,
Then they must have their proper uses.
Seeing simplicity, embracing purity—
Few private desires, little greed.
The world values these three,
Yet they say the world’s unrest comes from the insufficiency of adornments.
Thus some attach them to the Sage and *wisdom*,
Some to *virtue* and *righteousness*,
Some to cleverness and profit—
They would use adornments to govern it.

Yet the world grows ever more unstable—
Why not return to their root?
Seeing simplicity, embracing purity—
Few private desires, little greed—
Yet the world returns to its own nature,
Even if these three exist,
They have no use for them.

Therefore it is said:
I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people become upright;
I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity—
This is the clarity of the Sage’s great *wisdom*,
The utmost of *virtue* and *righteousness*,
The perfection of cleverness and profit.

Yet Confucius used the seven *righteousnesses*, rites, and music to govern the world,
While Laozi discarded and abandoned them—
Some may say they differ.

The *Yijing* says:
What is above *form* is called **Dao**,
What is below *form* is called *instruments*.
Confucius’ concern for future generations was profound,
So he showed people the *instruments* while concealing **Dao**,
Making those of average or lesser ability adhere to the *instruments*,
So they would not be dazzled by **Dao**,
And thus not fail to be gentlemen—
Yet those of average or greater ability
Could ascend from there on their own.

Laozi was not so—
He aimed to clarify **Dao** and urgently sought to open people’s hearts,
So he showed people **Dao** while slighting the *instruments*,
For he believed that if scholars only knew the *instruments*,
Then **Dao** would be hidden—
Thus he discarded *virtue* and *righteousness*,
Abandoned rites and music,
To clarify **Dao**.

**Dao** cannot be spoken of—
All that can be spoken are its semblances.
The enlightened use semblances to discern the true,
While the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into falsehood—
Thus there are those in later ages
Who cling to Laozi’s words to disrupt the world,
Yet those who follow Confucius have no great faults.
Those who use Laozi’s words to attain **Dao** are not few,
Yet those who seek **Dao** from Confucius
Often seem to have no way in.

These two Sage-Persons,
Both acted out of necessity—
To preserve one, they must neglect the other.

Zhao says:
Cast a stone into the sea,
It must reach the bottom or else—
If it does not reach the bottom,
There is no way to measure the sea’s depth.
Speaking of **Dao** must reach the point before things began to exist,
Or else there is no way to see **Dao**.

**Chapter Twenty: The Extremes of Governance**
When governance is at its peak,
The Sage and *wisdom* are discarded;
When it is established,
Things and affairs are not discarded—
How much less the Sage and *wisdom*?

**Chapter Twenty: Discard Learning, No Worries**
Discard learning, no worries.
The more one studies, the more one gains—
Yet the more one follows **Dao**, the more one loses.
Not knowing the rectitude of *nature* and *command*,
Yet seeking gain through study—
What has not been heard before,
Accumulated without end,
Yet lacking what unifies it—
Then it harms the square with the round,
The straight with the crooked,
And within it, all is in turmoil,
Yet they cannot escape their worries.»

**On the Scholar’s Plight and the Sage’s Way**

The scholar’s woe lies in reaching this state,
Thus it is said: *Discard learning, no worries.*

Yet the Sage never ceases to learn,
But takes **Dao** as his primary focus.
Not learning does not diminish him,
Nor does excessive learning disrupt him—
Serene and without worries,
Why would he need to discard learning?

Guang remarked:
*"The unenlightened scholar* calculates good and evil,
Hoping for practical use—
This is the minor use of what is useful.
*The one who discards learning* knows the unity of life and death,
Equates gain and loss,
Moves without attachment—
Yet remains unperturbed—
Thus, no worries—
This is the major use of what is truly useless.

Zhao remarked:
*"To practice learning is called 'hearing' (闻),
To discard learning is called 'neighboring' (邻).
Beyond these two lies true excess.
Then, beyond discarding learning, there is still higher ground to ascend.
How far apart are 'only' (唯) and 'yes' (阿)?
How distant are good and evil?

Scholars drown in what they hear,
Unable to unify it—
Thus, 'only' becomes excessive deference,
And 'yes' becomes arrogant presumption,
Far beyond mere comparison—
How much more so the stark contrast of good and evil?

Only the Sage knows all things share the same *nature*,
Yet arise from illusion.
Like drawing horses and oxen,
Or carving tigers and pigs—
None reflect their true forms.
Erased, they lose all distinction of right and wrong,
Same or different—
Who can measure their separation?

If one knows this,
Then all things flourish together without harm,
**Dao** flows in parallel without contradiction,
And reason finds no cause for astonishment.

What people fear,
One must not fail to fear.
The Sage balances self and others,
Unifies same and different—
His mind clings to nothing,
Yet does he neglect the world’s laws,
Transgressing boundaries of propriety and reason?
No.

What people do, I also do.
What people fear, I also fear—
Though I stand among rulers and subjects,
Parents and children,
And move within the realm of ritual and music,
Governance and punishment,
The world knows no difference in me.

Yet I do not entangle myself in things,
For my resolve is already set.

Zhenghe remarked:
*"The Sage drums all things into existence yet does not share their worries—
This is **Dao**.
Joys and calamities with the people—
This is governance.
Those who embody **Dao** have no worries,
Those who engage in governance have fears.
What people fear, yet the Sage does not take as warning—
Few can avoid calamity.
Thus the Sage cultivates through fear and reflection.*

Boundless, its end is unfathomable.
All follow their known paths,
Thus rigidly they do not stray beyond their limits.
The Sage traverses both existence and nonexistence—
Nonexistence cannot be entered,
Yet he remains boundless in his ascent.

Zhao remarked:
*"Su’s explanation of *naming-teachings* (名教) is correct.
But speaking of **Dao**,
What people fear—
To assent with 'only' and reject with 'yes'—
This is good, yet not evil,
For they have not forgotten good and evil,
Nor unified right and wrong.
Discarding learning brings no worries—
Boundless, its end is yet to be reached.
Below, it is said that he alone differs from the crowd—
This is clear.

The crowd rejoices like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
Like ascending spring platforms in delight—
I alone remain tranquil, yet unmanifest,
Like an infant before it can speak.
Each person indulges in their preferences—
Their joy is like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
Their delight like ascending spring platforms—
Blindly they follow, unaware of their error.

The Sage delves deep into their illusions,
Encounters them with calm indifference—
Like an infant before it can speak.

Unassuming, as if belonging nowhere.
Riding the *nature* of all things without selfishness,
Thus, as if belonging nowhere.
The crowd all have excess,
I alone seem to have cast it aside.
The crowd clings to their known truths,
Each believing they possess what is more than enough.
The Sage encompasses all things without favoring one,
Transcending, as if having cast it all aside.

Zhenghe remarked:
*"Achievements overshadow the world,
Yet I do not claim them as my own.
Foolish heart of mine—
Pure and simple.
Pure and simple, yet not truly foolish.
Zhenghe remarked:
*The Sage’s natural faculties remain unstrained,
Yet silently align with **Dao**.

The crowd are bright and clear,
I alone seem dim and obscured—
The crowd are sharp and discerning,
I alone am muddled and vague.
The common folk take distinctions as knowledge,
The Sage knows all illusions are insufficient for debate—
Thus, outwardly he seems obscured,
Inwardly he seems muddled.
Sudden, as if in darkness,
Silent, as if without end.
Sudden, as if in darkness—
No sight of his limits.
Silent, without purpose—
No sight of his resting place.
The crowd all have their talents,
I alone seem dull and coarse.
Each person has their abilities,
Thus the world employs them all.
The Sage’s talents are complete, his virtue fulfilled—
Yet he seems without ability,
Thus doubted as dull and coarse.

I alone differ from the people,
Yet hold dear the *Mother of all* (食母).
**Dao** is the mother of all things.
The crowd follow things and forget **Dao**,
While the Sage abandons all things,
Taking **Dao** as his ultimate principle—
Like an infant eating nothing but its mother’s milk."*

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue and Manifestation of the Dao**

The virtue of the Dao follows only from the Dao itself.
The Dao is formless—
Yet when it moves, it manifests as virtue,
And thus takes on appearance.
Therefore, virtue is the visible aspect of the Dao.

Extending this further,
All things’ appearances are the Dao manifesting in them.

The Dao, as a thing,
Is vague and indistinct.
Vague and indistinct—
Yet within it, there are forms.
Indistinct and vague—
Yet within it, there are things.

The Dao is neither being nor non-being,
Thus it is spoken of as vague and indistinct.
Yet when it moves and forms shapes,
When it settles and becomes things,
None escape its origin in vagueness and indistinctness.

Mysterious and dark—
Yet within it, there is essence.
At the juncture of being and non-being,
Vague and indistinct yet unseen,
When being and non-being intermingle,
Its mystery and darkness become profound and boundless—
Though not yet formed, its essence abides within.

Its essence is most true,
And within it, there is authenticity.
When things take form,
Truth and falsity become mixed.
When essence is pure,
Falsity cannot intrude.

Once truth and falsity are mixed,
From one it becomes two,
From two it becomes three—
Chaotic and entangled,
No longer trustworthy.

When essence is pure,
It does not deceive me.

From ancient times to now,
Its name does not fade—
It observes all transformations.
Though ancient and modern differ,
The Dao does not fade,
Thus it is called *unfading*.
Only because it never fades
Can it observe all transformations.

*Fú* means beauty.
Though all things are beautiful,
They cannot escape change.
How do I know all transformations are thus?
By this.

The Sage knows how all things are
Because he embodies the Dao and does not depart from it.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Conformity Brings Wholeness**

Conformity brings wholeness—
The Sage acts only in accordance with principle.
Where principle lies,
It may be straight or curved,
But the key is harmony alone.
Thus, it does not conflict with things,
And so it is whole.

Crookedness becomes straight—
Straightness without principle is not true straightness.
Though crookedness follows principle,
It is the most straight in the world.

Hollow becomes full—
Where all gather, it is low.
Though one may wish to avoid fullness,
It cannot be avoided.

Exhaustion brings renewal—
Bright and clear is not the Dao.
Muddled and obscured—
Yet daily renewal arises from this.

Fewness brings attainment—
The Dao is one.
Attaining one means attaining all.
Excess brings confusion—
Many studies without unity bring confusion.

Thus, the Sage holds to *One* as the model for all under heaven.
Holding to *One* is returning to nature.
For conformity brings wholeness,
Crookedness becomes straight,
Hollow becomes full,
Exhaustion brings renewal,
Fewness brings attainment,
Excess brings confusion—
All are remnants of holding to *One*,
Thus it concludes with *Holding to One*.

**Ye** says:
Conformity brings wholeness, hollow becomes full, necessity brings attainment—these are principle;
Crookedness becomes straight, exhaustion brings renewal—these are natural forces.
Crookedness is not sought for straightness,
Yet extreme crookedness must become straight.
Exhaustion is not sought for renewal,
Yet extreme exhaustion must bring renewal.
Principle and force complement each other,
Sometimes forming beginnings and ends,
Sometimes alternating gain and loss—
Chaotic and inexhaustible,
Yet the Sage alone can hold to *One*,
Not changing with them,
Thus making it the model for all under heaven.

Not self-appearing, thus clear—
The eye does not see itself,
Thus it can see things.
The mirror does not illuminate itself,
Thus it can illuminate things.
If it were to see and illuminate itself,
It would have no time for anything else—
How could it attend to things?

Not self-asserting, thus manifest—
Not self-praising, thus功成 (*gōngchéng*—achievement fulfilled);
Not self-exalting, thus enduring.
Only because it does not contend,
None under heaven can contend with it.

Not self-appearing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—
All are remnants of non-contention,
Thus it concludes with *non-contention*.

The ancients spoke of *conformity brings wholeness*—
Was this empty speech?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

The world takes straightness as right,
Curvedness as wrong,
Yet if one follows principle in the world,
There will be no avoiding curvedness,
Thus the chapter concludes:
Is this empty speech?
Truly, it is whole and returns to this.

What is called *whole* is not merely preserving oneself—
Internally, it preserves oneself;
Externally, it preserves things.
Preserving both self and things,
Returning to nature—
Then its straightness is great.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Rare Speech and Naturalness**

Rare speech, naturalness.
Speech arising from naturalness
Is simple yet precise.
If not natural yet forced,
It becomes verbose and untrustworthy.

Thus it is said:
When the Dao issues from the mouth,
Its flavor is insipid,
Its sight is indistinct,
Its sound is inaudible,
Its use is inexhaustible—
This is called *rare speech*.

**Guang** says:
Rare speech is speech without leaving traces of speech,
Thus speech without ever speaking—
Merging with the natural Dao, like the sound of a bird’s cry.

A gust of wind does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Who does this?

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Rare Speech and Naturalness (continued)**

Heaven and Earth—
Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
Yet how much less can mortals?
When yin and yang do not contend,
The winds and rains come in due season,
Neither hasty nor sluggish,
Expending their force fully before ceasing.
But when yang surges upward and yin sinks downward,
When blocked and unable to vent,
Then come the gusting winds and torrential rains.
Though they may rage, their force cannot last a day.
The sages of old spoke sparingly,
Acted with ease,
All following their natural course—
Thus enduring without exhaustion.

The world may weary of this,
Preferring deceitful words to please the ear,
Or startling deeds to dazzle the eye,
Yet they know not why such things cannot last.

**Zheng He** says:
Heaven and Earth shape the myriad things—
The wind scatters them, letting all forms transform naturally,
The rain nourishes them, allowing all things to flourish on their own.
Thus they neither over-generate nor over-prompt,
Yet all things thrive between Heaven and Earth—
This is why they endure long.

But gusting winds and sudden rains bring discord to yin and yang,
And if forced, they bring harm—
Thus they cannot last.
Therefore, those who follow the Dao:
Those aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;
Those aligned with virtue gain virtue;
Those aligned with loss gain loss.
Those aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao;
Those aligned with virtue obtain virtue;
Those aligned with loss obtain loss.

Confucius said:
If one’s resolve is in *ren* (benevolence),
There is no evil—
Thus it is said: *"The faults of the virtuous are easily pardoned."*
If resolve in *ren* is thus,
How much more so for those resolved in the Dao?

If one truly follows the Dao,
Those who align with it gain the Dao,
Those who align with virtue gain virtue—
Even if they err, though they lose in their actions,
They must still gain in virtue and Dao.

**Zhao** says:
The true aligns with the true,
The false aligns with the false—
Illuminating the obscure, harmonizing the hidden,
One with its true nature,
Neither gain nor loss,
Neither purity nor defilement,
Enlightenment and ignorance equal.
Faith insufficient, doubt arises.
Those who do not know the Dao
Have shallow faith in it,
And when they err, they doubt it—
Thus their doubt only grows.
Only those who truly know the Dao
Do not let gain or loss shake their faith.

**Pan** says:
Descend into *rare speech*,
And one loses the constancy of life and nature—
Insufficient faith will surely lead to disbelief.

**Zhao** further says:
This chapter on the Dao’s subtlety should be understood through **Zhao’s** words,
Yet the text’s flow is disjointed.
Let me explain:
*Rare speech and naturalness*—this is the foundation of discussing the Dao.
Only when virtue and Dao are lost
Do *ren*, *yi*, *li*, and *zhi* arise.
If one truly follows the Dao,
Who speaks of gain or loss?
But later generations, lacking sincerity,
Doubt—
Like gusting winds and sudden rains,
Which could never last a day.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Cannot Stand**

The limping cannot stand,
The striding cannot walk.
The self-admiring are blind,
The self-righteous are unillustrious,
The self-praising achieve nothing,
The self-conceited do not endure.

No one can stand and walk at once—
If one deems standing and walking insufficient
And adds striding or limping,
None can preserve their standing or walking.
The same applies to self-admiration,
Self-righteousness,
Self-praise,
And self-conceit.

**Zheng He** says:
To limp and seek to stand,
To stride and seek to walk—
This defies nature’s constancy,
And the body’s ease is hard to achieve.
To see oneself is to lack wisdom to encompass all things—
Thus one is blind.
To insist on being correct is to lack benevolence to unite the many—
Thus one is unillustrious.
To possess virtue yet lose it through boasting—
Thus one achieves nothing.
To boast of one’s abilities yet lose them through arrogance—
Thus one does not endure.
In the Dao, this is called *"excess food, superfluous actions."*
Like eating and drinking—
When sated, one stops;
Excess brings illness.
Like the four limbs—
When complete, they suffice;
Superfluity becomes a burden.
Some may despise this,
Yet those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indeterminate Oneness**

There is an indeterminate Oneness,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
The Dao is neither clear nor turbid,
Neither high nor low,
Neither departing nor arriving,
Neither good nor evil—
Yet it coalesces into form,
In humans, this is called *xing* (nature).
Thus it is said: *There is an indeterminate Oneness.*

None know its origin—
It is tranquil, ever-present,
And from it, Heaven and Earth arise.

**Guang** says:
The Dao cannot be divided—*indeterminate*.
No effort—*coalesces*.
No beginning—*born before*.

The formless form,
Existing alone before Heaven and Earth.

**Zheng He** says:
Heaven and Earth also depend on this to arise—
Thus it is said: *Born before Heaven and Earth.*

Silent and vast,
Independent yet unchanging,
Circulating yet unexhausted—
It can be the Mother of all beneath Heaven.

Silent, with no sound,
Vast, with no form—
Independent, unmatched, yet never varying,
Circulating among all things, yet never failing—
Descending to nurture the myriad creatures,
Thus it is their Mother.

**Guang** says:
Detached from dependence—*independent*.
True and constant—*unchanging*.

**Zheng He** says:
Untouched by motion,
Uninvolved with things—
Tranquil, and that is all.
Great constancy sustains it,
Unchanging with all things.

Speaking of the Dao’s essence:
Its utility flows in and out,
Coming and going without end—
Speaking of the Dao’s function:
All things rely on it to live.

I do not know its name—
I call it *Dao*,
And forcefully name it *Great*.

The Dao originally has no name—
The Sage saw that nothing exists without it,
Thus named it *Dao*.
Seeing nothing can surpass it,
Thus forcefully named it *Great*.
Yet in truth, it cannot be named.

**Guang** says:
Beyond measure—*Great*.
*Great* means *passing away*,
*Passing away* means *distant*,
*Distant* means *returning*.
Seeking it from *Greatness*,
It has already passed and gone—
Seeking it from *going*,
It is distant and unreachable.
Though it passes, though it is distant,
Yet seeking it in return,
A single mind suffices.

**Lu** says:
The Dao is forcefully named *Great*,
Yet in truth, it has already passed and grown distant.

「Its departure is not distant—
It lies in knowing its *return*,
In naming *return* to match reality,
In acting to align with principle.

**Guang** says:
A solitary movement without abiding is *passing away*,
Reaching the utmost while utterly detached is *distant*,
To approach while ever more distant,
To withdraw while ever more near—
This is *returning*.
Thus, the Dao is *Great*,
Heaven is *Great*,
Earth is *Great*,
And the Sage is *Great*.
Within the realm, there are four *Great* things,
And the Sage occupies one of them.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows **Nature** (*zìrán*).
Speaking in terms of the Dao,
Even Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are insufficient to be *Great*.
Yet people universally recognize the *Greatness* of the three,
And do not believe in the Dao’s *Greatness*—
Thus, I tell them of reality:
Humans are not as *Great* as Earth,
Earth is not as *Great* as Heaven,
Heaven is not as *Great* as the Dao,
The Dao is not as *Great* as **Nature** (*zìrán*).
Yet if one recovers their true nature in a single day,
Then these three *Great* things,
Humans can fully comprehend them.

**Lu** says:
The realm’s "cloud" refers to the Dao’s non-existence beyond the six directions.
**Guang** says:
The Three Realms (*sān cái*) follow the Dao—
The end does not depart from the beginning,
And **Nature** (*zìrán*) is the Dao itself.
Abandoning the Dao’s forced name,
We reveal the utmost principle of **Supreme Mystery** (*zhòngxuān*).

**Zhao** says:
Some ask the recluse of Zhongtiao, Yuan Yong, saying:
When speaking of the Dao, one already touches upon it—
Yet to say "the Dao" is to depart from the Dao itself.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Root of the Light, Stillness as the Lord of the Restless**

The heavy is the root of the light,
Stillness is the lord of the restless.
In all things, the light cannot bear the heavy,
The small cannot restrain the great,
The unmoving makes the moving move,
The unstirred controls the stirred—
Thus, the light relies on the heavy as its root,
The restless on stillness as its lord.

Therefore, the Sage moves all day without departing from their burdens.
Though there are palaces and towers of splendor,
Their dwelling surpasses them in stillness.
To move while light yet not depart from burdens—
Though palaces bring joy, one must still dwell in stillness,
For the necessity of heavy and stillness is thus.

How can the ruler of a great realm
Lighten themselves against the world?
If the ruler lightens their body to bear the world,
They will be insufficient to bear the world.

To lighten is to lose ministers,
To be restless is to lose the Sage.
To lighten or be restless without remedy is futile—
Yet if the Sage lightens themselves, ministers know they cannot rely on them,
If ministers are restless, the Sage knows their minds are set on gain—
Thus it is said: To lighten is to lose ministers,
To be restless is to lose the Sage.

**Zhao** says:
The ancients called elevated brilliance "observation."
The towers and palaces of brilliance—
Though there are palaces of splendor,
Their dwelling surpasses them in stillness—
This illustrates stillness, like the Southern Honor (*Nánróng*).
---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtuous Movement Leaves No Trace, The Virtuous Speech Knows No Flaw**

The virtuous movement leaves no trace—
Moving in accordance with principle,
Thus leaving no trace.
**Guang** says:
Mounting with the rear wheels first,
Driving with spirit-horses—
This is without fixed timing,
That is without fixed place,
How can there be traces?

The virtuous speech knows no flaw—
Speaking only when necessary,
Thus their words fill the world without error.
**Guang** says:
The Perfect One in speech—
Their lips murmur, and the response is clear;
No attachment to truth or meaning,
They speak as if in a dream,
They speak and forget their speech—
How can there be flaws or censure?

The virtuous calculation does not rely on tallying tools—
All things’ numbers are laid out before them,
Yet they know without calculation—
How need they tallying tools?
**Guang** says:
Even dust fills the Earth,
Even drops complete the sea,
Yet to exhaust the Dao and know all things—
To know one and thus know ten thousand—
What need for tallying tools?

The virtuous closure requires no bolt or key to be unopened,
The virtuous binding needs no rope or knot to be undone.
A person of complete virtue—
Toward all things,
Like a mother to her child,
Though they let them go, they do not depart—
Thus, no bolt is needed to close,
No rope is needed to bind.

Therefore, the Sage always knows how to rescue people—
Thus, they abandon no one;
Always knows how to rescue things—
Thus, they discard nothing.
To rely on calculations for planning,
To set bolts for closure,
To hold ropes for binding—
Their reach is limited.

The Sage toward humanity—
Not only does they tolerate them,
But also knows how to rescue them;
I abandon no one—
How can people not return to me?
This is called *cloaking brilliance* (*xímíng*).

Rescuing people from peril and hardship—
This is not the greatest rescue.
When they drift through life and death,
When obscured by things,
And I impart my utmost clarity to them,
Making the dark ones bright—
Like lamps passing on light without ceasing—
Then this can be called the greatest rescue of people.

Thus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
The Sage does not cherish their teacher,
Nor does the world love their resource.
The Sage does not love their resource—
Because they do not cling to teaching;
The world does not cherish their teacher—
Because they do not cling to learning.
The Sage does not merely forget the world,
But also makes the world forget them.

Though wisdom is vast and confused,
This is called *essential mystery*.
The Sage’s mystery—
Even the wise may not fully comprehend.

**Guang** says:
When sickness persists, medicine remains—
When sickness abates, medicine departs—
Medicine and sickness both depart—
Humans follow the twofold forgetting—
Great awakening as if in confusion—
This is the *essential mystery*.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing Its Masculine**

Know its masculine,
Hold to its feminine,
To be a valley for the world.
To be a valley for the world,
Their constant virtue does not depart—
Returning to the state of the infant.
Know its purity,
Hold to its darkness,
To be a model for the world.
To be a model for the world,
Their constant virtue is unerring—
Returning to the state of **Supreme Mystery** (*wújí*).
Know its glory,
Hold to its shame,
To be a basin for the world.
To be a basin for the world,
Their constant virtue is sufficient—
Returning to the state of **Simplicity** (*pǔ*).

Masculine and feminine,
Are the first and last that reach us.
Darkness and purity,
Are the bright and dim that reach us.
Glory and shame,
Are the noble and base that reach us.
To desire the first while hating the last,
To desire the bright while hating the dim,
To desire the noble while hating the base—
This is the nature of things.
Yet the first and last reaching us,
Are not as pressing as the bright and dim,
The bright and dim reaching us,
Are not as deep as the noble and base.

The ancient Sages abandoned delusion to seek recovery of their true nature—
The clearer their nature,
The lower their guard;
The lower their guard,
The thicker their virtue;
The thicker their virtue,
The greater their return.»

The cover of ignorance without action
Is not as profound as knowing yet refraining—this is the utmost.

To know the **masculine** while holding to the **feminine**—
This is the knowing of nature.

When knowing nature, the will to contend ceases,
And all who strive to be first shall return to it,
Like water rushing to a ravine—none depart.

Yet still, like an infant,
It can receive but not yet employ—
Thus it is said: *"Return to the infant."*

To know the **white** while holding to the **black**—
This is the seeing of nature.

Dwelling in darkness yet perceiving brightness,
All who are bright cannot escape its form.

Thus, when myriad lights follow it as law,
Though responding to all things,
Its law never errs,
Its use never exhausts—
Thus it is said: *"Return to the Uncarved (Wuji)."*

To know **glory** while holding to **shame**—
This is the recovery of nature.

When all delusions are exhausted,
Dwelling in shame yet without resentment,
Vast as the emptiness of a valley,
Things come and it responds.

Virtue is sufficient here—
Pure nature, unmixed—
Thus it is said: *"Return to Simplicity (Pu)."*

Simplicity dispersed becomes **vessels**;
The Sage employs them as **officials and leaders**—
Thus the great principle does not sever.

The Sage, having returned to Simplicity,
Disperses Simplicity into vessels
To respond to all things.

Like a sovereign dividing governance to establish officials,
It follows the natural course of affairs—
Though governed, there is no severance.

**Political Harmony** says:
That which is above form is called **Dao**,
That which is below form is called **vessels**.

There are names and distinctions,
There are divisions and responsibilities—
When Dao is whole, Heaven and humanity unite as one;
When vessels are dispersed, Heaven and humanity separate as two.

**Zhao** says:
The earlier passage speaks of *"Returning to Simplicity"*—
Simplicity is the completeness of Dao;
Severance means division into two things—
Thus the great principle does not sever.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Nine: "Those Who Would Take the World"**

Those who would take the world and do so,
I see they cannot but fail.

The Sage’s possession of the world
Is not a taking—
All things return to it;
Unable to refuse, they receive it.

Their governance of the world
Is not an imposition—
They follow the natural course of things,
Removing only their harm.

If one takes and imposes,
It cannot be achieved.

The world is a divine vessel—
It cannot be forced.

To force it brings ruin;
To grasp it brings loss.

All things cannot be forced—
Even among a hundred people,
If they do not follow their nature and act arbitrarily,
There will surely be discord and resistance—
How much more so the world?

Yet small things, few in number,
May be taken by force or seized by cunning,
But the world, with its divine master,
If not allowed to return naturally, will rebel;
If not permitted to govern itself, will fall into chaos.

Thus things either move or follow,
Either warm or cool,
Either strengthen or weaken,
Either complete or destroy.

Therefore the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids imbalance.

Yin and yang surge against each other,
High and low tilt each other,
Great and small govern each other.

Some move ahead,
Some follow behind,
Some warm with breath,
Some chill with draft,
Some nourish and strengthen,
Some diminish and weaken,
Some complete and form,
Some ruin and destroy—
All are the natural course of things,
An inescapable force.

Yet the foolish of the world,
Selfishly seeking gain,
Would resist and defy it—
Their ruin is either sudden or gradual.

The Sage, knowing it cannot be reversed,
Follows and awaits it,
Avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids imbalance,
So that nothing oversteps and harms things—
And the world knows no calamity.
This is the utmost of *not-forcing*.

Though Yao and Tang could not escape droughts and floods,
They never reached ruin—
This is why.

The *I Ching*’s **"T'ai (泰)"** says:
*"The later sage completes Heaven and Earth’s way,
Assists and harmonizes their suitability,
To govern the people on the left and right."*

Three yang within, three yin without—
Things have reached their utmost fullness.

The Sage fears overreach and harm to life,
Thus completes and assists it,
So that nothing oversteps—
This is called *avoiding excess, avoiding extravagance, avoiding imbalance*.

---
**Chapter Thirty: "Assisting the Sovereign with Dao"**

To assist the sovereign with Dao
Is not to use force to dominate the world—
Its affairs return naturally.

The Sage uses force only when unavoidable.
If not unavoidable, yet desiring to dominate the world,
Though they may succeed,
Their ruin will surely return—
King Ling of Chu, King Mo of Qi, Qin Shi Huang, and Emperor Wu of Han,
Some perished themselves,
Some brought ruin to their descendants.

What men abhor,
The spirits detest—
None escape.

Where armies tread,
Thorns grow.
After great armies,
There are years of famine.

Where force is used,
Civil affairs decay—
Fields lie fallow.
After war,
Killing qi prevails—
Harvests are ruined.

All force is thus—
How much more so when used to dominate the world?

Thus the good decide only when necessary,
Daring not to take by force.

*"Decide"* means to resolve.
When virtue cannot pacify,
When governance cannot subdue,
Only then does one resort to force as a last measure.

Decide without arrogance,
Decide without boasting,
Decide without pride,
Decide only when unavoidable—
This is to decide without force.

Not arrogance, not boasting, not pride, unavoidability—
These are the ways of *not-forcing*.

Things in vigor age—
This is called *not-Dao*,
And *not-Dao* perishes early.

The vigorous must age—
There is no exception.

Only the Dao-complete
Achieve while appearing incomplete,
Are full while appearing empty,
Never grow vigorous, thus never age,
Never die.

To dominate the world with force—
How vigorous it is—
Yet how can it avoid aging?

---
**Chapter Thirty-One: "The Fine Weapon"**

The fine weapon—
An ominous instrument,
Things often detest it,
Thus the Dao-complete do not dwell upon it.

It is used to resolve crises,
Not as a constant.
Thus they do not dwell upon it.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: "The Dao Ever Nameless"**

The noble one, when at rest, honors the left;
When wielding arms, honors the right.
The weapon—an ominous instrument—
Is not the instrument of the noble one.
Used only when unavoidable,
Serenity and simplicity are supreme.

To triumph without delighting in it—
Yet those who delight in victory are those who love to kill.
He who loves to kill
Cannot prevail in the world.

Auspicious matters honor the left,
Inauspicious matters honor the right.
Thus, the Assistant General takes the left,
The Supreme General takes the right,
And is treated with funeral rites.
When many are slain, they are lamented with sorrowful weeping,
And victory is treated with funeral rites.

The Dao ever nameless—
Though crude and small,
The world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would come as guests of their own accord.

Crude—this is their nature.
The Dao ever nameless,
Thus their nature too cannot be named.

Therefore, when expanded, it is nowhere absent;
When contracted, it does not fill the slightest space—
This is why, though small, it cannot be subdued.

Even the lowliest man, if he guards it,
May refine himself with dust and dregs
To the stature of Yao and Shun.
Yet lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,
And all things refuse to come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.
The pure *qi* ascends and descends,
Uniting as one,
Descending sweet dew—
Gently covering all things,
Without fail or omission.

The sage embodies the Perfect Way
To respond to all things,
Like sweet dew reaching everywhere—
This is how he can make all things come as guests.

When names were first established,
Names having been established,
One must also know when to stop—
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

The sage disperses the crude to form instruments,
Using instruments to establish names—
How could he abandon the crude for names,
Or pursue the superficial and lose the root?

Indeed, he knows to return to his nature,
Thus he rides through all transformations without peril.

Compare the Dao in the world
To valleys and rivers with the sea.
The sea is the bell of water;
Valleys and rivers are its branches.
The Dao is the origin of all things;
All things are its branches.
All are water, so valleys and rivers return to their bell;
All are Dao, so all things come as guests to their origin.

Zhao said: All sayings speak of all things coming as guests to the Dao,
Like valleys and rivers returning to the sea.
Bing Wen alone differed, saying:
If so, it should be said, "All things come as guests to the Dao,
Like rivers returning to the sea."
Jiang He and Ma Dan doubted the character *with* (与),
And changed it to *rush toward* (赴)—both incorrect.

I privately think this chapter speaks of the Dao originally having no name,
Then names being established—
For the sun, moon, stars, mountains, grasses, and trees.
The sage uses them,
Establishing officials and titles—
Though names differ, they are all one Dao.

Like water in the world:
As valleys, as rivers, as seas—
Though forms differ, they are all one water.
The scholar must forget names
And return to the nameless crude—
Thus, "One must also know when to stop"—
To stop at the Dao.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: "Knowing Others is Wisdom"**

Knowing others is wisdom,
Knowing oneself is enlightenment.
Discrimination is wisdom,
Exhaustive understanding is enlightenment.
As long as discrimination remains,
One stops at knowing others but cannot know oneself.
When understanding is exhaustive,
One knows oneself and can also extend to others.

He who overcomes others is strong,
He who overcomes himself is powerful.
Strength can reach others but not oneself;
To conquer oneself and restore one’s nature—
This is beyond the reach of strength,
Thus he may be called powerful.

He who knows contentment is rich.
He who finds sufficiency in what he encounters
Is never without wealth.
Though he possess the world,
If he dwells there with a heart of perpetual lack,
He will never be rich.

The resolute in action have willpower—
Not contending with things,
Yet ever striving without ceasing,
No one can take away their resolve.

He who never loses his foundation endures long.
Things change without constancy,
Yet the heart never strays—
This is enduring long.

He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.
The transformation of life and death is great,
Yet nature remains undiminished—
This is how the ancient sages achieved neither life nor death.

Shi said:
To live without living is endurance;
To die without dying is longevity.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: "The Great Dao Flows"**

The Great Dao flows—
It can be left or right.
Flowing, it knows neither "can" nor "cannot,"
Thus left and right, up and down,
Circulating without bound.

Guang said:
Its "can" is also "cannot."
The Great Dao cannot be fixed or demanded,
Cannot be grasped through opposition.
All things rely on it to live yet it does not claim them;
Its deeds accomplished, it does not name itself.

In the world, there are those who give life yet do not claim it—
They will surely name it as their own;
There are those who avoid things yet do not possess them—
They will surely reject them and fail to sustain life.
To give life yet not claim,
To accomplish yet not possess—
Only the Dao does this.

It clothes all things yet is not their master,
Thus it ever lacks desire—
It may be called *small*.
All things return to it yet it is not their master—
It may be called *great*.
Thus the sage never claims greatness,
And so achieves true greatness.
Great yet without the heart of greatness—
Then it is small.

Zheng He said:
It covers all things yet does not display its sovereign power,
Thus it is not their master.
It stirs and guides the multitude yet no trace of their return is seen,
Thus it is unknown as their master.
The Dao is not one to be named as great or small—
When it is said "may be called," it refers to the Dao’s reach to things.

Mencius said:
To transform greatly is called sagehood.
To transform greatly, then how could there be the burden of greatness?
Thus he achieves true greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: "Holding the Great Image"**

Holding the Great Image,
The world comes toward it.
The Dao is neither being nor non-being,
Thus it is called the Great Image.
If it were clearly manifest,
There would be both likeness and difference—
Those who like it come,
Those who dislike it go,
And it cannot make all things come toward it.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: "The Principle of Withdrawal"**

To go forth without harm,
Peace and tranquility are secured.
If there are likes and dislikes,
Then there are benefits and harms.
When likes and dislikes are exhausted,
Then toward all things it does no harm.
Thus the arriving find no want of peace,
No want of balance,
No want of ease.

Music and bait—
Passing guests are detained.
The Dao, when spoken of,
Is bland as though without flavor.
To look upon it, insufficient to see;
To listen, insufficient to hear;
To use it, it cannot be exhausted.
Yet if one composes music and sets bait
To await those who come,
How could it not suffice to detain passing guests?
Yet when the music ends and the bait is spent,
They will abandon it and depart.

But if one holds the Great Image to await the world,
The world does not know to love it—
How much less would it know to hate it?
Though it lacks fragrance, taste, form, color, or sound to please people,
Its use cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: "The Dao’s Ever-Non-Action"**

The Dao is ever in non-action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
To act in all things while maintaining non-action—
This is the intent of non-action.

If lords and kings could guard this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation begins to stir,
I shall govern it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.

The Sage transforms all things through non-action.
Things transform through it,
Beginning with non-action and gradually reaching action.
Take, for instance, the eldest brother’s growth—
People rise artificially,
Thus the decline of the Three Dynasties,
And the ever-worsening changes in human nature.
When their stirrings begin,
And those above and below all grow dissipated,
Their transformations become so extreme as to be beyond speech.
If, when their stirrings arise, one does not act to move them,
And instead restrains them with the nameless Primordial Simplicity,
Perhaps it may be possible to halt them.

The nameless Primordial Simplicity
Will also not desire.
Through non-desire and stillness,
The world will naturally rectify itself.

The Sage harbors no thought of clinging to the Primordial,
Nor displays any trace of it externally,
Thus the Primordial is preserved and its power is vast.
If the heart still clings to the Primordial within,
It is already far from attaining it.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: "The Dao’s Constant Non-Action"**

The Dao is constantly in non-action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
To act in all things while maintaining non-action—
This is the meaning of non-action.

If lords and kings could guard this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation begins to stir,
I shall govern it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.

The Sage transforms all things through non-action.
Things transform through it,
Beginning with non-action and gradually reaching action.
For example, the growth of the eldest brother—
People rise artificially,
Thus the decline of the Three Dynasties,
And the ever-worsening changes in human nature.
When their stirrings begin,
And those above and below all grow dissipated,
Their transformations become so extreme as to be beyond speech.
If, when their stirrings arise, one does not act to move them,
And instead restrains them with the nameless Primordial Simplicity,
Perhaps it may be possible to halt them.

The nameless Primordial Simplicity
Will also not desire.
Through non-desire and stillness,
The world will naturally rectify itself.

The Sage harbors no thought of clinging to the Primordial,
Nor displays any trace of it externally,
Thus the Primordial is preserved and its power is vast.
If the heart still clings to the Primordial within,
It is already far from attaining it.

**Leaf’s Commentary:**
The transformations of things cannot be fully exhausted.
It seems as though there is one who, though appearing to do nothing,
Yet pushes and moves all things.
Thus, when one sees expansion, one does not know where withdrawal is intended;
When one sees strength, one does not know where weakness is intended.
The same applies to ruin and revival, giving and taking.
Though subtle, this can be made clear—
This is how softness conquers hardness,
How weakness conquers strength.

The Sage’s way in the world
Also has its own unfolding,
Yet it cannot be shown to people—
Thus it is called a sharp instrument.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
The *Kaiyuan* [commentary] claims the Sage employs stratagems—
This is incorrect.
Wisdom and insight are already abandoned;
How much more so deceit and trickery?
The *Lü* and *Su* schools say that such principles exist in things—
This is close.
Leaf’s view—that there seems to be a Creator who pushes and moves all things,
To prove the meaning of softness conquering hardness—
This is correct.
What is called a sharp instrument,
Is it not the very softness and weakness?

**Chapter 38: The Virtue of the Highest Virtue Does Not Virtue**

The highest virtue does not cling to virtue—
Thus it has virtue.
The lower virtue clings to virtue—
Thus it lacks virtue.

The Sage lets his heart’s desires unfold without overstepping bounds,
Not because he intentionally seeks virtue—
Virtue arises naturally.

Those of lesser wisdom recognize virtue’s worth
And strive to attain it without loss,
Yet they merely preserve themselves—
What true virtue do they possess?

The highest virtue acts without action yet achieves without effort.
The lower virtue acts and yet still strives for achievement.
To act without action yet still strive for achievement—
This is still action.

Those of lesser wisdom cannot succeed without effort,
Yet they still strive for achievement—
Not mere empty action without method.

**Zheng’s Commentary:**
Not thinking yet attaining,
Not striving yet hitting the mark,
Not acting yet arriving—
This is the virtue of the highest.

Not thinking yet failing to attain,
Not striving yet missing the mark,
Not acting yet failing to arrive—
This is the virtue of the lower.

The highest benevolence acts without striving for achievement,
The highest righteousness acts while still striving for achievement.
Benevolence and righteousness alike do not force their way—
Benevolence triumphs by not striving for achievement,
Righteousness succeeds by striving for achievement.

Virtue has high and low,
Yet benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—
Why so?

The lower virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,
And those who fall below righteousness—
Need not be spoken of further.

The highest ritual acts yet meets no response,
So it rolls up its sleeves and enforces it.
From virtue descending to ritual,
This is how the Sage governs the people—
To the utmost.

Thus, when action meets no response,
It rolls up its sleeves and compels it.
When compulsion still meets no response,
Then punishments arise and arms are raised—
This is mere empty action without method.

Thus, when the Way is lost, virtue follows,
When virtue is lost, benevolence follows,
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows,
When righteousness is lost, ritual follows.
Ritual, though thin in loyalty and trust,
Is the beginning of chaos.

Loyalty and trust without ritual—
They remain unseen.
Ritual established, their excellence shines outward.
Between ruler and subject, parent and child,
Husband and wife, friends—
Their brilliance is dazzling, yet their substance is empty.

Follow it and order prevails;
Defy it and chaos ensues.
The gap between order and chaos—
Narrower than a hair’s breadth—
Thus it is called the beginning of chaos.

**Foreknowledge** is the flower of the Way,
Yet the start of folly.

The Sage gazes deeply into all things,
Judging right and wrong, gain and loss—
All laid out before him,
Like sunlight revealing form,
Seeing all without distinction of before or after.

Common folk see only with their eyes,
Hear only with their ears,
Think only with their minds,
Lost among all things,
Exhausting their intelligence to perceive—
Though they call it wisdom,
They know not that folly begins with self-assurance.

Thus, the noble man abides in substance, not in superficiality,
In reality, not in ornament—
Hence he discards the latter for the former.

The vulgar man delights in what he gains below,
Forgetting what is above—
Thus he rejoices in superficiality and abandons substance.
Who but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?

**Lu’s Commentary:**
When loyalty and trust weaken within,
Ritual is established to prevent chaos—
Thus ritual is called the beginning of chaos,
Not that ritual itself is the beginning of chaos.

Foreknowledge is the flower of virtue and morality,
Manifesting outwardly, it elevates ritual to guide the foolish—
Not that wisdom is the start of folly.

Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—
These are tools suited to their times.
To govern the present by the past,
One must root oneself in the substance of virtue and morality.
To transform the present and return to the past,
One must begin with ritual,
Flowing downstream to return to the source.

**Zhao’s Commentary:**
The Sage’s intent in holding to the past to govern the present
Was to gradually restore the governance of non-action.
Thus he first expounds on virtue and morality,
Then confuses benevolence and righteousness,
And finally clarifies ritual and music—
This gradual approach inevitably leads to harsh laws and governance,
A natural consequence of his words.

Common scholars thus scorn benevolence and righteousness,
Destroy ritual and law,
Believing that without benevolence and righteousness, chaos reigns,
And without ritual and law, how long before all become beasts?
This is why the scholars of Jin and Song abandoned themselves,
Until their nation fell and they perished without knowing it.

How could they know the Sage’s true intent
Or Laozi’s original discussion of ritual?

---

**Chapter 39: The One of Old**

The One of old—
Heaven gains the One and thus is clear,
Earth gains the One and thus is tranquil,
The Spirit gains the One and thus is numinous,
The Valley gains the One and thus is full,
All things gain the One and thus live,
The sovereign gains the One and thus governs the world.

The One—this is the Way.
All things exist as they do because of the Way.

People of the world see things yet forget the Way—
Heaven knows only its clarity,
Earth knows only its tranquility,
The Spirit knows only its numinosity,
The Valley knows only its fullness,
All things know only their living,
The sovereign knows only his governance—
Yet they do not know that all this comes from the Way.

If Heaven loses the One, it nearly shatters,
If Earth loses the One, it nearly erupts,
If the Spirit loses the One, it nearly fades,
If the Valley loses the One, it nearly drains,
If all things lose the One, they nearly perish,
If the sovereign loses the One, he nearly falls.

*"Nearly"* means the extreme is reached.

Heaven, though it loses the One, does not yet shatter,
Earth, though it loses the One, does not yet erupt,
The Spirit, though it loses the One, does not yet fade,
The Valley, though it loses the One, does not yet drain,
All things, though they lose the One, do not yet perish,
The sovereign, though he loses the One, does not yet fall—
Yet the extreme is still this.

Thus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,
The high is founded on the lowly.
Heaven and Earth’s grandeur,
The sovereign’s nobility—
All are the result of the One.

Now, what is this One?
What is it?

It cannot be seen, yet it is present—
It cannot be grasped, yet it is there—
This is the utmost subtlety under Heaven,
This is what is called *lowly* and *base*.

Thus, the sovereigns of old styled themselves *"Orphan"* and *"Lonely"*—
Was this not to take the lowly as their root?
Those who once used such titles
Merely took their root while abandoning their branches.

Therefore, when gathering the many into a carriage,
They did not desire it to gleam like jade,
Nor to clatter like stone.
The spokes, the hub, the axles, the yokes, and the crossbars—
When assembled, they form a carriage.
Each part can be counted,
Yet the carriage itself cannot be counted—
Only then does one know that *non-being* makes the carriage.
This is what is called *"using non-being for utility."*

Now, does Heaven and Earth become Heaven and Earth by being vast?
Does the sovereign become a sovereign by being noble?
Within the vast and the noble, there is still the One preserved—
This is how they become Heaven and Earth, how they become sovereigns—
Yet none know how it is accomplished.

Thus, the One dwells in nobility yet is not noble,
Dwells in baseness yet is not base—
Unlike jade, which gleams and cannot be made base,
Or stone, which is base and cannot be made noble.

Zhao said: All interpretations teach *"carriage"* as *"car"*, but the meaning is not yet settled. I suspect it aligns with the common view.
*"Carriage"* and *"platform"* are terms for the lowly—
The earlier text spoke of attaining the One,
This speaks of gathering the many.

*"The many without the many"* is like saying *"all are carriage-makers, yet no carriage-maker"*—
No carriage-makers, no sovereigns either.

The Master of Chongcheng said: *"Without days, there are no years"*—
This is the same intent.

They did not wish to be like jade, gleaming and polished,
Nor like stone, rough and unrefined—
Though noble and base differ in name,
Their unity is far beyond such distinctions.

Yet I dare not claim this as my own—
I merely await future sages.

The *Rhapsody of King Lü* speaks of *"carriage"* as praise—
This is also close to being forced.

*The inversion of Dao/Way is its dynamic motion...*

**Dao/Way’s Movement: The Fourth Chapter of "The Dynamic of Inversion"**
*The inversion of Dao/Way is its dynamic motion...*

**The Return to Nature Brings Stillness**
When nature is restored, stillness ensues.
Yet though it remains motionless and tranquil,
When stirred, it flows through all things—
This is where movement originates.

Fuxi said: *"Return to the root, and stillness arises; stillness alone can move."*

The Dao’s use lies in its weakness.
Formless, soundless, the Dao is the weakest of all things beneath heaven—
Yet nothing surpasses its strength.
This is how it governs all things.

All things arise from *having*, yet *having* arises from *non-being*.
The world fails to grasp stillness as movement,
Or weakness as strength—
Thus I speak of their origin.

For all things beneath heaven,
There is the known principle of mother governing child,
Yet never the child governing mother.

**The Noble Hear the Dao**
The superior hear the Dao and diligently practice it;
The mediocre hear the Dao and cling to it uncertainly;
The lowly hear the Dao and laugh at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

The Dao is neither form nor visible,
Neither sound nor audible.
It precedes all things, vast and unobstructed,
Yet its clarity is doubted.
Thus the lowly scorn it as absurd and laugh;
The mediocre doubt it, clinging to it as if it might vanish;
Only those who see it clearly
Diligently practice and embrace it without weariness.

Confucius said: *"When I speak to him, he does not lose my meaning—*
This is Zilu."
How like the superior!

The *Record of Established Speech* says:
*"Establish"* means to found.
The ancients established such speech,
And Laozi took it—
This is what the lowly expounds.

**The Manifestation of the Dao**
The Dao is bright yet seems obscure—
It illuminates all without scrutiny.
Advancing the Dao seems like retreat—
Though it does not move, nothing outpaces it.
Leveling the Dao seems like unevenness—
Yet where it reaches, all is even, yet nothing is worn down.
The highest virtue is like a valley—
The highest virtue does not cling to virtue,
Like the emptiness of a valley.
Great whiteness seems like shame—
To be white yet unsoiled is the pride of the unwashed,
Not the saint.
Broad virtue seems insufficient—
When virtue is boundless and cannot be exceeded,
It stops there—this is not broadness.
Establishing virtue seems like laziness—
Following nature’s spontaneity without contrivance,
Externally appearing slack yet truly established.
True substance seems corrupted—
Embodying nature and embracing spirit,
Adapting to all things without losing its essence,
Externally appearing flawed.

The *Politics of Harmony* says:
*"Not rigid—yet when polished, it does not splinter;
Not white—yet when stained, it does not darken.*
The greatest square has no corners—
Preserving its vastness, it does not cling to sharp edges.
Great vessels take long to form—
Their magnitude renders them unusable early.
Great music is rare in sound—
Beyond what the ear can hear.
Great forms are shapeless—
Beyond what the eye can see.
The Dao is hidden, nameless.

Only the Dao
Is generous and fulfills.
Wherever the Dao meets, it is seen—
These twelve are its manifestations in affairs.
Yet the Dao’s completeness remains hidden in its namelessness.
It meets where needed, extends its abundance,
Lends where lacking—
Thus all things rely on it to complete.

**Dao/Way Generates the One**
The Dao generates the One,
The One generates the Two,
The Two generates the Three,
The Three generates all things.

All things carry *yin* within *yang*,
And harmonize through *chong-qi* (interpenetrating breath).
The Dao is neither One nor Two—
When it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not.
Thus it is called the One, yet the Dao is not One.

One with One makes Two,
Two with One makes Three—
From here onward, all things arise.
Though myriad in difference,
All carry *yin* within *yang*,
And harmonize through *chong-qi*—
For things arise from Three,
And Three from One—
This is the natural order.

Pang said:
*"One is the Supreme Ultimate,
Two is *yin-yang*,
Three is *chong-qi*."*

What the world despises—
The solitary, the orphaned, the destitute—
Yet kings and lords adopt these titles.
The world does not know the origin of all things,
Valuing the few and small while honoring the many and great.
Yet the ancient sages knew—
Thus things may be diminished yet benefit,
Or benefited yet diminished.

What the world teaches,
I also teach.
The overbearing do not meet a good end—
I shall make this my lesson.

The world takes weakness as loss,
Strength as gain—
Yet they are mistaken.
Thus I teach all beneath heaven:
*"Have you not seen the overbearing meet their end?"*
The overbearing are the extreme of arrogance.

When the world knows the overbearing do not escape death,
They will know arrogance cannot be sustained—
Then I can speak of the Dao.

**The Supreme Weakness**
The supreme weakness
Gallops over the supreme strength.
Nothing enters where there is no gap—
Thus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (non-action).

The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of *wuwei*—
Few beneath heaven attain them.

With strength to counter strength,
It does not bend but shatters;
With weakness to counter strength,
Neither weakens nor harms the strong.
Look to water—
This is how.

With *having* entering *having*,
They repel each other;
With *non-being* entering *having*,
The *non-being* is never weary,
The *having* never aware.
Look to ghosts and spirits—
Thus the sage alone can practice *wuwei*,
And thus master all strength,
Enter all *having*—
Hence the teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of *wuwei*—
Few beneath heaven attain them.

**Name and Body**
Which is closer: name or body?
Which is more: body or wealth?
To value name above body,
To honor body above wealth—
This is still not forgetting oneself.

---

**The Forgotten Self**
He who forgets himself
Has not even his own body,
Much less name or wealth.
Yet to value the body above all beneath heaven,
One must first forget the self.
Thus he makes all beneath heaven know
That name is not what should be cherished,
That wealth is not what should be prized—
Only then does one know to value the body,
And only then does one know to forget the self.
This is the intent of Laozi.

Which is more harmful: gain or loss?
He who has not lost yet suffers loss as disease,
But when he has gained and fears losing it,
His suffering exceeds that of loss itself.
Only by balancing gain and loss,
By equalizing possession and deprivation,
Does one escape disease.

Thus excessive love brings great expenditure,
Excessive hoarding brings great loss.
The more one loves, the more one will do to obtain it—
How can one avoid depletion?
The more one hoards, the more will seek to take it—
How can one avoid loss?
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing when to stop brings no peril—
Thus one may endure.

**Chapter 45: Great Fullness as Deficiency**
Great fullness seems deficient,
Yet its use is unexhausted;
Great abundance seems empty,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Beneath heaven, they call non-deficiency "fullness,"
Yet fullness must eventually decay;
They call non-emptiness "abundance,"
Yet abundance must eventually fail.
The sage seeks great fullness yet does not fear deficiency,
Aims at great abundance yet does not despise emptiness—
Thus he is full yet does not decay,
Abundant yet does not fail.

Great straightness seems crooked,
Great skill seems clumsy,
Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Straight yet not crooked, it will surely break;
Follow the Way and act, though crooked, it remains straight.
Skillful yet not clumsy, it will surely weary;
Let things take their natural course, though clumsy, it is skillful.
Eloquent yet not inarticulate, it will surely exhaust itself;
Speak according to the Way, though inarticulate, it is eloquent.

Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat,
Yet clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.

To be full yet not deficient,
Abundant yet not empty,
Straight yet not rigid,
Skillful yet not cunning,
Eloquent yet not verbose—
This is like agitation unable to be still,
Or stillness unable to agitate.

Agitation can overcome cold but not heat,
Stillness can overcome heat but not cold—
Both are trapped in one extreme and not the true norm.
Only the serene and clear, untouched by any one thing,
Neither full nor deficient,
Neither abundant nor empty,
Neither straight nor crooked,
Neither skillful nor clumsy,
Neither eloquent nor inarticulate—
Only then can one overcome all,
And thus stand as the true norm for all beneath heaven.

**Leaf’s Commentary:**
Cold and heat are the *qi* of heaven and earth.
If one here can overcome cold through agitation,
And heat through stillness,
Then knowing what one overcomes,
What cannot be mastered?
Thus clarity overcomes turbidity,
Stillness overcomes movement—
Their effects are already evident.
How much more so
Deficiency overcoming fullness,
Emptiness overcoming abundance,
Crookedness overcoming straightness,
Clumsiness overcoming skill,
Inarticulateness overcoming eloquence?
Yet because they do not perceive this,
They must seek what can overcome—
If they seek to overcome, it will never be the true norm.
Only clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.

---

**Chapter 46: The Way in the World**
When the Way prevails beneath heaven,
Warhorses are turned to plowing fields;
When the Way is lost beneath heaven,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

When all beneath heaven follow their proper place,
There is no contention, yet all is self-governed—
Thus warhorses are turned to plowing fields.
When the Way is lost beneath heaven,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

**Governance by Harmony:**
To rule beneath heaven with the Way,
The people take joy in their labors,
And there is no contention—
Only tilling the fields remains.

No guilt is greater than desiring what is forbidden,
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No blame is greater than demanding possession.
To show others what they may desire
Is already guilt enough,
But those who do not know sufficiency
Suffer even greater calamity,
And those who demand possession
Bear the greatest blame.

Even a common man, if he harbors one of these,
Will suffer their consequences;
A sovereign who does so
Will surely see warhorses arise.

**Lu’s Commentary:**
The ruler without the Way poisons all beneath heaven,
And his evils are threefold:
To see what is desirable yet seek it without reason—
This guilt is the greatest.
To seek without ceasing—
This brings harm to many—
This calamity is the greatest.
To desire without fulfillment—
This stokes the heart further—
This blame is the greatest.

Thus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.
To know sufficiency in what one encounters—
Then there is no insufficiency.

---

**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**
Without leaving the door, one knows all beneath heaven;
Without peering through the window, one sees the Way of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.

The *xing* as essence
Fills the universe entirely,
With no difference in near or far, ancient or modern.

The sages of old knew all without leaving door or window—
Only because their *xing* was whole.

Men of the world are obscured by things,
Their *xing* divided by ears and eyes,
Within, confused by body and mind,
Without, blocked by mountains and rivers—
Their sight does not extend beyond vision,
Their hearing does not extend beyond listening,
And even the smallest opening can obscure and cut them off.

They do not know that the sage restores *xing* and finds sufficiency,
Yet they still seek by going out—
Thus the farther they go, the less they know.

Observe the body to know the body,
Use the inner to know the outer,
Begin with the small to know the great,
Clarify the near to understand the far.
Thus the sage acts without moving yet knows,
Sees without looking yet names,
Accomplishes without doing.

What *xing* reaches is not merely knowing and naming—
It can also follow things in their natural course,
Achieving without effort.

**Light’s Commentary:**
Emotion seals—then stagnation;
Reason aligns—then divinity.

**Lu’s Commentary:**
When the sage eats, he thinks of the world’s hunger;
When he dresses, he thinks of the world’s cold;
His love for his parents extends to the world’s elderly;
His love for his children extends to the world’s young—
He need not leave the door to know all beneath heaven.

If one loves life,
He knows the Way of heaven’s nurturing all things;
If one attends to affairs,
He knows the Way of heaven’s completing the four seasons;
If one delights in goodness,
He knows the Way of heaven’s favoring the virtuous—
Why gaze through the window to see the Way of heaven?

The Way does not act yet knows human nature intimately,
Does not see yet names the Dao of heaven;
Achieves perfect governance without effort—
This is because it traces back to the original nature of body and mind.

**Chapter 48: Daily Advancement in Learning**
Daily advancement in learning,
Yet if one does not know the Way while diligently studying,
And accumulates knowledge without unifying it,
One remains merely a student.

Confucius said:
*"Much hearing, then selecting the good and following it—
Much seeing, then recognizing it—
This is the second stage of knowing."*

**The Way of daily diminution.**
Once one truly knows the Way,
Gazing upon all things,
None escape being illusory—
Abandon illusion to recover original nature,
Yet original nature is soon restored.

Confucius said to Zigong:
*"Do you take me for one who hears much and remembers it?"*
*"Yes,"* he replied. *"Is that not so?"*
*"No,"* Confucius said. *"I grasp it with a single thread."*

Diminish again and again,
Until reaching *wuwei*—
*Wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.
Abandoning illusion to recover nature is diminution,
Yet the mind of abandoning illusion still lingers.
Only when even this mind is forgotten,
And nature is pure with no remainder,
Then all is done without losing *wuwei*.

Diminution is gradual:
First, diminish traces,
Then diminish the mind—
When both traces and mind are forgotten,
One arrives at *wuwei*.
Thus, to take the world requires *wuwei*,
Yet when action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.

All men harbor the desire to take the world,
So they create affairs to seek it.
When the mind manifests externally, things resent it,
Thus it can never be attained.

The sage acts without contrivance,
So there are no affairs—
His mind manifests externally, yet things are at ease.
Though he does not take the world,
The world returns to him.

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**
The sage has no fixed mind,
Taking the people’s mind as his own.
To the virtuous, he is virtuous;
To the unvirtuous, he is also virtuous—
To the trustworthy, he is trustworthy;
To the untrustworthy, he is also trustworthy—
Virtue and trust.

Empty and formless,
Yet taking the forms of all things as its forms—
Square when in the square,
Round when in the round.
If the void itself had form,
How could it shape all things?

Thus the sage has no mind,
Taking the people’s minds as his own—
To the virtuous and unvirtuous alike, he is virtuous;
To the trustworthy and untrustworthy alike, he is trustworthy.
Virtue and trust lie in others,
Yet my way of being virtuous and trustworthy
Never wavers—
This is called virtuous virtue.
Trust and distrust lie in others,
Yet my way of being trustworthy
Never changes—
This is called virtuous trust.

Otherwise, favoring the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous,
Trusting the trustworthy while abandoning the untrustworthy—
How could this be called
*"constant virtue saving all"*?
Thus, no one is abandoned.

The sage in the world,
Dull and indistinct for the world,
Blending his mind—
The people fix their ears and eyes upon him,
Yet the sage treats them like infants.

The world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,
Each clings to its own correctness,
Mutually condemning and harming,
Uncertain where to settle—
The sage worries for them,
Thus dull and indistinct, blending their minds—
No good, no evil,
No truth, no falsehood—
He meets all with unity.

They fix their ears and eyes,
Observing the sage’s rewards and punishments,
Yet I meet them with the simplicity of an infant—
Neither delighting in the good,
Nor resenting the evil—
Thus the virtuous do not grow arrogant,
And the wicked do not grow angry,
All relax and transform,
And the world begins to settle.

**Leaf’s Commentary:**
The sage in the world
Exists yet does not govern.

**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**
Birth and death—
Nature knows neither.
Emerging, it becomes birth;
Retreating, it becomes death.

Thirteen are the companions of life,
Thirteen the companions of death,
And thirteen the ways men move toward death’s ground.

Those who use things to refine and nourish themselves
Are companions of life.
Those who indulge in sounds, colors, smells, and tastes
Are companions of death.

These two distinguish the paths of life and death—
Yet I know action yet do not know rest,
Know speech yet do not know silence,
Know thought yet do not know forgetting—
Striving toward exhaustion,
This is called moving toward death’s ground.

The paths of life and death in ten words:
Each occupies three—
Is it not that nine belong to life and death,
And one to neither?

Neither life nor death—
This is what the *Yijing* calls *"still and unmoving."*

Laozi speaks of the nine,
Yet omits the one,
Letting men find it themselves,
And entrusting the subtlety of *wuwei* and *wuwu*.

**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**
Those who associate with life and death
Are bound to blame life while opposing reason,
Or forget life while pursuing gain.

When men’s lives are moved toward death’s ground,
Their life and death—what choice is there?
Why?
Because their attachment to life is deep.

Life brings death,
Thus companions of life are companions of death.
The more men rely on life,
The more death’s path dominates—
Nineteen times out of twenty.

It is said that those skilled in preserving life
Walk on land without encountering rhinos or tigers,
Enter armies without bearing arms.
Rhinos have no place to thrust their horns,
Tigers no place to strike with claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.
Why?
Because they lack death’s ground.

The Perfect Man dwells always in neither life nor death—
If life’s ground is absent,
How could death’s ground exist?

**Chapter 51: The Way Gives Birth**
The Way gives birth,
Virtue nurtures,
Things shape it,
Circumstances complete it.

The Way is the mother of all things,
Thus the giver of birth is the Way.
When it moves, it becomes virtue,
Tending the multitude without complaint,
Thus the nurturer of all things is virtue.

Yet virtue and the Way cannot shape themselves—
They manifest through things.
Things cannot complete themselves—
Far and near interact,
Hard and soft intermingle,
Accumulating into circumstances,
And the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos are realized.

Thus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue.
Though form arises from things and completion from circumstances,
Without the Dao, nothing is born;
Without virtue, nothing is nurtured.
Therefore, the Dao is honored as a parent,
And virtue is revered as a sovereign king—
For the Dao holds no rank, yet virtue bears a name.

The Dao’s eminence, virtue’s nobility—
None bestow them, yet they abide naturally.
To rely on rank for honor and nobility
Is not true honor and nobility.

Thus the Dao gives birth and nurtures,
Grows and matures,
Completes and ripens,
Nourishes and shelters.
It births yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Guides yet does not dominate—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

**Chapter 52: The Beginning of All Things**
The beginning of all things is the mother of all things.
The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
When the Dao is yet Nameless, it is the source from which things arise;
When it is Named, it is the substance from which things are born.
Thus it is called both Beginning and Mother—
Its offspring are all things.

Having found its Mother, one knows its offspring.
Having known its offspring, one returns to guard its Mother—
And thus, throughout life, one faces no peril.

The Sage embodies the Dao to use things,
As one knows the child through its Mother—
Clear and unerring in all perception.
Though wisdom encompasses all,
Yet never does it forget the Dao,
Thus it ever guards its Mother.

Close the senses, shut the gates—
And one’s life remains unexhausted.
Open the senses, pursue affairs—
And one’s life is never saved.

All under Heaven possess this Dao,
Yet they always suffer from forgetting it and serving things.
The eyes delight in colors,
The ears delight in sounds—
Opening the heart’s desires,
And using them to fulfill them—
Thus they sink their whole lives in ruin,
And cannot be saved.

The Sage’s way to avoid exhaustion
Is to close and shut them—
Never venturing to serve them.

To see small is called clarity.
The harm of delight begins small yet grows great.
Knowing it small yet becoming great,
Close and shut it—
This is called clarity.

To guard softness is called strength.
Chasing what delights yet refusing it,
One believes oneself strong—
But it is not strength.
Only he who sees delight and fears it
Can be called strong.

Using its light, returning to its clarity—
No harm befalls the body—
This is called following the constant.

The common man opens his desires,
Sacrificing himself to things,
And never returns.

The Sage closes and shuts them—
Not to reject things,
But to respond with the spirit,
Using its light while the self remains untouched.

The ears hear, the eyes see,
The nose smells, the mouth tastes,
The body feels, the mind thinks—
All are called light.
When light meets things,
Things may reach their limit,
Yet clarity is undiminished.
Thus it responds to all changes without exhaustion,
And harm does not touch its body—
Hence its constant nature endures unbroken.

**Chapter 53: Let Me Make This Clear**
Let me make this clear: if I have knowledge,
And walk the Great Dao,
I must fear only my actions.

One who embodies the Dao
Has no knowledge, no action,
No schemes to set in motion—
Yet things transform naturally.

Now, with knowledge and action,
Walking the Great Dao,
The schemes and structures I establish
Are not its natural way—
And there is cause for fear.

**Zhao** says:
To have knowledge is to have ignorance.
The Sage’s heart knows nothing,
Thus it knows all.

Small knowledge is the ruin of great knowledge.
The Great Dao is most smooth,
Yet people love shortcuts.
The Great Dao is smooth and easy,
With no steep paths or obstacles—
Yet those who do not know
Deem it circuitous and slow,
And prefer shortcuts for speed.

Thus all who abandon their natural way
And set schemes in motion
Are those who seek haste.

Palaces are empty,
Fields lie fallow,
Granaries are bare.
Fine silks and sharp blades,
Gluttony in food and drink,
Excess in wealth—
This is called thieving vanity.
It is not the Dao.

The common man is bright and clear;
I alone seem dim.

The common man is sharp and discerning,
I alone am dull and obscured.
How could I adorn externals while neglecting the root,
And make schemes my business,
Boasting to teach thieves?

**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation**
One who builds well does not uproot,
One who embraces well does not loosen.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Does the world truly have those who build yet do not uproot,
Or embrace yet do not loosen?
Only the Sage knows the true nature of *xing* (性),
Discerns the falsehood of things,
Diminishes things to cultivate the self—
Thus their virtue accumulates and fills.

Though they establish nothing in reality,
Their foundation is unshakable;
Though they grasp nothing in reality,
Their embrace is unbreakable.
Thus even to their descendants,
Sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate the self, and virtue becomes true;
Cultivate the family, and virtue overflows;
Cultivate the village, and virtue endures;
Cultivate the state, and virtue abounds;
Cultivate the world, and virtue is universal.
Once the self is clearly cultivated,
Extend its principle outward—
Even to governing the world is possible.

Thus observe the self with the self,
Observe the family with the family,
Observe the village with the village,
Observe the state with the state,
Observe the world with the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Beyond heaven and earth lies what the world cannot see,
Yet its principle can be inferred and known.
When self-cultivation reaches its peak,
Observing the self with the self,
Observing the family with the family,
Observing the village with the village,
Observing the state with the state—
All are within my grasp.
Yet how do I know the Sage observes the world with the world,
Not as I observe the self with the self?
Can the self not be observed by the self,
While the world cannot be observed by the self?
Thus it is said: *How do I know the world is thus? By this.*
For it is known through the self alone.

**Lu’s Commentary:**
One who builds well grounds the state in the Dao,
Thus its roots run deep and its foundation is unshakable;
One who embraces well enfolds the people with virtue,
Thus no bonds can sever them.
Their descendants enjoy long prosperity,
Sacrifices never cease.

Below, from *"Cultivate the self"* onward,
The progression is vast—
From observing the self to the world,
A constant truth,
Known without stepping outside.

**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**
The depth of contained virtue
Is like that of an infant.

When Laozi spoke of Dao and virtue,
He often likened them to an infant,
For he spoke only of their essence,
Not yet their function.

Now, an infant lies tranquil, untroubled—
Its essence is complete.
Yet the infant does not know how to respond to things,
So it cannot be said to lack function.

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not attack,
Raptors do not seize.
The Dao has no form—
Things cannot even see it,
How could they harm it?

What makes humans susceptible to harm
Is their having a mind.
Only when there is a mind does form arise,
Only when form arises does an enemy arise,
And only when an enemy arises does harm come.

One without a mind—
Things and enemies—
How could they harm them?

The reason an infant reaches this state
Is solely because it has no mind.

Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm;
It does not yet know the union of male and female, yet it moves—
The essence is complete.
Without grasping, yet it holds;
Without desire, yet it acts—
Thus it is known that its essence is abundant,
Not its mind.

It cries all day yet its voice does not grow hoarse—
Harmony is complete.
When the mind moves, the *qi* is injured,
And when *qi* is injured, the cry becomes strained.
Yet it cries all day without strain—
Thus it is known that its mind does not move
And its *qi* is harmonious.

Knowing harmony is *cháng* (常),
Harmony is not being harmed from without.
Returning to one’s true nature is *cháng*,
Meeting things and knowing their origin is *cháng*.
Knowing harmony is *cháng*,
Obtaining the origin and responding to all things is *cháng*.
They are one and the same Dao,
Thus all are called *cháng*.

Knowing *cháng* is enlightenment,
Excessive life is *xiáng* (祥).
Life cannot be artificially prolonged,
Yet if one tries to prolong it,
It is not the true way.
*Xiáng* is *yāo* (妖).

Forcing *qi* with the mind is coercion.
If *qi* naturally resists disorder
Yet the mind forces it further,
Coercion becomes extreme.
When things reach their peak, they decline—
This is called *not* the Dao,
And the Dao declines early.
Forcing life makes *qi* unable to follow its natural course,
Day by day it enters rigidity and coercion,
And aging follows—
Thus the infant’s true nature is lost.

**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**
The wise do not speak,
For speech reveals ignorance.

**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak (continued)**

「塞其兑，閉其門，挫其鋭，解其忿，和其光，同其塵，是謂玄同。
The Daoist seals his *fuè* (口),
Closes his gates,
Dulls his sharpness,
Dissolves his anger,
Blends his radiance,
Mingles with the dust—
This is called *Xuántóng* (玄同).

The Dao is not spoken of,
Yet it is not separate from speech,
But those who know may not speak,
And those who speak may not know.
Only by sealing *fuè* and closing gates,
Dulling sharpness and dissolving anger,
Blending radiance and mingling with dust,
To govern one’s inner self—
In silence, one aligns with the Dao.
Thus it is said:

*"The wise do not speak,
Yet speak without speaking,
Truly forgetting speech."*

One who speaks without knowing,
Whose words fail to strike the mark,
How much more so in matters of debate?
To embody the Dao and transcend all attachments,
To lose the traces of *Xuántóng*—
This is *Xuántóng*.

Master Sima says:
The Dao abhors fierce blades and sharp edges,
It despises laborious deeds,
It shuns dazzling brilliance,
It values humility and dishonor—
Thus the Dao cannot be grasped as near or distant,
Beneficial or harmful,
Honored or degraded.
Hence, it is most honored by all under heaven.

If it can be grasped as near, it can be grasped as distant;
If it can be grasped as beneficial, it can be grasped as harmful;
If it can be grasped as honored, it can be grasped as degraded.
The Daoist, embodying the Dao,
Covers all things equally—
Who then is near or distant?
Views all with equal measure—
Who then is beneficial or harmful?
Knows neither glory nor shame—
Who then is honored or degraded?
Beyond the reach of schemes and calculations,
This is why the Dao is most honored by all under heaven.

**Chapter 57: Governing with the Dao**

Governing with *zhèng* (正) is the Dao,
Employing *qí* (奇) in warfare is the Dao,
Acquiring the world without action is the Dao.

The ancient sages were gentle yet far-reaching,
Powerful yet close at hand.
They had no will to wage war,
Only when unavoidable did they engage in campaigns.
Thus, governing the realm is *zhèng* (正),
Employing force is *qí* (奇).

Yet even this is insufficient to claim the world.
The world is a sacred instrument of the Dao,
Unto be wrought.
Those who act upon it fail,
Those who grasp it lose it.
Only the Daoist, embodying the Dao,
Is effortlessly without action—
Though insufficient to claim the world,
Yet the world returns to him.

How do I know this to be true?
By this.»

**Chapter 58: The Dao of Governance and Its Hidden Workings**

When the world abounds in taboos, the people grow ever poorer.
When the ruler multiplies taboos, the common voice cannot reach above—
then the people are impoverished and without recourse.

When the people abound in clever devices, the state grows ever more deluded.
Clever devices are stratagems and schemes.
A wise ruler above must always keep the people in ignorance and without desire.
When the people abound in stratagems, their superiors are dazzled and deluded.

When the people abound in clever arts, strange things proliferate.
When the people neglect their roots and pursue superficial skills,
then useless and extraordinary things arise.

When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and robbers multiply.
Distrusting the people’s deceit, one multiplies laws to overcome them—
yet when the people have no place to turn, theft and robbery only increase.

Thus the sage says:
*I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;
I remain without concern, yet the people grow rich;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*

**Governance in Obscurity**
When governance is obscure, the people are pure;
When governance is scrutinizing, the people grow cunning.
Calamity and fortune lean upon each other,
Fortune and calamity lie hidden within.
Who knows their ultimate end?
Perhaps there is no fixed standard.

The upright becomes the strange,
The good becomes the ominous.
The people are deeply confused—
and this state has endured for long.

**The Grandeur of Heaven and Earth and the Common Perception**

The vastness of Heaven and Earth,
The common view of the world—
There are things they **overlook** (*yǒu suǒ míng*¹) yet fail to comprehend.

For fortune leans upon calamity,
And calamity lies hidden within fortune,
Like the cycles of day and night, of cold and heat, passing one another.

The upright becomes the strange,
The good becomes the ominous,
Like the stages of infancy and old age, of life and death, following in turn.

There was never an absolute upright,
Yet those who are confused fail to recognize it.

Only the sage emerges beyond all things,
Surveying their beginning and end,
Grasping their perfect whole yet discarding their petty scrutiny,
Seeming obscure as if nothing were clear—
And thus the people are pure, each fulfilling their true nature.

But common folk do not grasp the fullness of the Dao,
Taking what their ears and eyes perceive as ultimate.
They think themselves fortunate,
Yet fail to see the calamity lurking behind;
They believe themselves good,
Yet fail to recognize the ominous arising within.
Their trivial observations, they call them clarity—
Yet excessive scrutiny only harms, and they do not awaken to its folly.
Is this not lamentable?

Thus the sage is square yet does not cut,
Honest yet does not carve,
Straight yet does not overreach,
Bright yet does not dazzle.

Knowing that petty scrutiny cannot exhaust the fullness of things,
Though he may possess the ability to be square, honest, straight, or bright,
He does not employ these abilities,
For fear of falling into one-sidedness and not returning to balance—
This is what the common world calls *obscurity* (*mènmèn*).

**Harmonious Governance** says:
Square yet cutting breeds rigidity in argument;
Honest yet carving invites arrogance in self-purification;
Straight yet overreaching gives rise to the attitude of domineering;
Bright yet dazzling brings the peril of self-aggrandizement.

Only the sage knows these abilities yet does not use them.

**The Collected Commentaries of the *Zhen* Dao/Way Classic**, Volume Four, *Commentaries by the Scholar Zhao*.

**Chapter 59: *Harmonious Governance and Serving Heaven***

To govern people and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses *frugality* (*shè*).
For only through *frugality*
Does one attain *early service*—
*Early service* is called *accumulating virtue/power* in depth.
To accumulate virtue/power deeply
Is to achieve what cannot be overcome;
What cannot be overcome
Is to know no limits—
And knowing no limits,
One can establish a state.
The foundation of establishing a state,
This is what endures long.

All things:
Square yet they are cut,
Honest yet they are pierced, #1
Straight yet they overreach,
Bright yet they dazzle.
Yet the sage is square yet does not cut,
Honest yet does not pierce,
Straight yet does not overreach,
Bright yet does not dazzle—
This is what is called *frugality*.
For *frugality* means
Having yet not employing.

The world’s affliction lies in its inability to subdue others,
Yet if one truly possesses *frugality* and practices it,
Though never competing with others,
Others recognize they cannot overcome you—
Then your subjugation comes early.
Once others are subdued,
You gather and conceal your strength,
Until even when your life ends,
You never reveal your full capacity—
Then virtue/power is deeply accumulated.
When virtue/power is thickly accumulated,
Even the world’s strongest cannot overcome you—
Then none can fathom or measure you.
Only then can you establish a state.

Yet the petty men of the world,
With even a handspan of power,
Use it lightly—
Once they test and fail to subdue,
The world measures their depth and contests them,
Though they wish to preserve their state,
They cannot.

Thus I know that *frugality* can establish a state—
This is the foundation of establishing a state.
This is called *deep-rooted and firm-belted*,
The Dao/Way of *long life and enduring vision*.

Mencius said:
To exhaust one’s heart,
To nurture one’s nature—
This is how one serves Heaven.

To govern people with *frugality*
Is how one can establish a state.
To serve Heaven with *frugality*
Is how one attains deep-rooted firmness.

The ancient sages preserved their nature and life’s constancy,
Not wasting externally or internally—
Then their roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,
Their stems are firm and cannot be torn away—
Thus even *long life and enduring vision* are attainable.

Though governing people and serving Heaven
May differ in internal and external,
Yet their harmony is one.

**Chapter 60: *Governing Great States***

To govern a great state,
As one poaches a small fish.
Poaching a small fish,
One must not disturb it—
Governing a great state,
One must not weary the people.
To weary them is to exhaust them;
To disturb them is to ruin the fish.
To rule the world with the Dao/Way,
Its spirits are not numinous.

The sage acts without action,
Letting people follow their natural course—
Externally seeking nothing,
Internally fearing nothing—
Then none can invade them,
Even the spirits have no power to harm.

**Lu’s Commentary:**
When the sage rules the world with the Dao/Way,
The harmony of Heaven and Earth responds—
Cold and heat alternate,
Life and transformation unfold—
At such times, the spirits have no mystic response—
What numinous power could there be?
It is not that the spirits are not numinous,
But their numinousness does not harm.
It is not that their numinousness does not harm,
Nor does the sage harm.
It is not that the spirits’ numinousness does not harm,
But the sage never harms—
Thus the spirits have no power to act.

**Ye’s Commentary:**
The sage does not harm—
Examining the following passage on *virtue’s reciprocal return*,
It is people who become numinous.
For when neither harms the other,
Virtue reciprocally returns.
That people and spirits do not harm each other
Is because there is a sage above—
Thus virtue reciprocally returns.
People return virtue to the spirits,
And also return virtue to the sage.

---

**Chapter 61: *Great States as the World’s Flow***

Great states are the world’s flow—
The world’s convergence upon great states,
Like waters rushing to the lowlands.
The world’s exchange,
The world’s *yin*—
*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,
And stillness is the lowly.
All movement rushes to stillness,
Just as all heights rush to the lowlands.
Thus great states, by descending to small states,
Take them;
Small states, by descending to great states,
Are taken by them.
Great states, by descending, take others;
Small states, by descending, are taken by others.
Speaking of the great descending,
It seems they should not descend to take others—
Yet they do.
Speaking of the small descending,
They cannot but descend to be taken by others.
Great states seek only to nurture others;
Small states seek only to serve others—
Both attain what they desire,
Thus the great should descend.

**Harmonious Governance Commentary:**
Heaven’s Dao descends to nourish and shines brightly,
Thus nothing is left uncovered;
Earth’s Dao is low yet ascends,
Thus it can support Heaven.
Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven—
Thus the great should descend.

---

**Chapter 62: *The Dao/Way as the Essence of All Things***

The Dao/Way is the essence of all things,
A treasure of the virtuous,
A refuge of the unvirtuous.
Beautiful speech can be traded,
Noble conduct can elevate others.
What is the harm in a person’s flaws?
All that appears externally
Are but their thresholds and halls.
The Dao/Way in things
Is like their essence—
All things possess it,
Yet none see it.

Only the worthy attain and hold it,
Thus it is called the treasure of the virtuous.
The foolish, though unable to possess it,
Yet without the Dao/Way they cannot rest—
Thus it is called the refuge of the unvirtuous.
The Dao/Way does not distance itself from people,
Yet people distance themselves from it.
If one truly speaks beautifully,
It can be traded in the world;
If one practices noble conduct,
It can elevate others.
Though in the morning one acts unjustly,
And in the evening hears the Dao/Way,
Exhausting all falsehoods,
One’s nature returns—
Even if one seeks to point out their flaws,
They cannot be found—
And how could they be abandoned?

Thus establishing a sovereign,
Appointing the Three Ministers,
Even with a jade tablet and four horses ahead,
It is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.
Establishing a sovereign,
Appointing the Three Ministers,
Is to save people with this Dao/Way.
Though jade tablets are precious,
And four horses are fine,
Presenting them is not as beneficial
As sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.

The ancient reason why this Dao/Way was held in high esteem was not because it could be sought to obtain, or used to escape blame? Therefore, it is held in high esteem by all under Heaven.

The Dao/Way originates within oneself; people’s misfortune lies in not seeking it. If one seeks, one will obtain it. The Dao/Way has no merit or guilt; people’s misfortune lies in not knowing it. If one knows it, one will have no guilt and cannot be stained by it.

**Chapter 63: The Chapter on Non-Action**
To act without acting,
To manage without managing,
To savor without savoring—
Great or small, much or little,
Repaying grudges with virtue.

The Sage acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone;
Manages without managing, yet nothing is left unattended;
Savors without savoring, yet nothing is left unsavored.
Toward greatness or smallness, muchness or littleness,
One simply meets them all with the Dao/Way.

What people never forget is resentment.
Yet when their love and hatred fade,
Even repaying resentment is done with virtue—
Then one knows how to apply virtue without restraint.

Difficult things must be addressed when they are easy;
Great things must be undertaken when they are small.
The most difficult tasks under Heaven
Must begin when they are easy;
The greatest undertakings under Heaven
Must begin when they are small.
Thus the Sage never strives for greatness,
And so achieves true greatness.

Light promises lead to few fulfilled words,
Many easy things lead to many difficulties.
Thus the Sage treats even the difficult with caution,
And so remains free of difficulty.

People fear the great and scorn the small,
Dread the many and seek the few.
When they wait until things are difficult before acting,
Or until things are great before undertaking them,
Their affairs are doomed to fail.

The Sage equalizes great and small,
Unifies much and little,
Holds nothing in fear,
Sees nothing as difficult—
And how could their affairs fail?

**Chapter 64: The Chapter on Ease in Holding**
What is settled and easy to hold,
Before its signs appear, is easy to plan;
What is fragile is easy to break,
What is subtle is easy to disperse.
Act before it exists,
Order before it is disordered.
When it has not yet arisen,
Hold and plan for it—
That is sufficient.
When it is about to manifest,
Only by dispersing it before it forms can it be removed—
Yet even then, it is better than when already formed.

Thus, acting before it exists is supreme;
Ordering before it is disordered is secondary.

A tree as thick as one’s embrace
Grows from a tiny sprout;
A nine-tiered tower
Rises from a single clod of earth;
A thousand-li journey
Begins with a single step.

The doer brings about failure,
The grasper loses hold.
Thus the Sage, with no action, knows no failure;
With no grasping, knows no loss.

The coming of chaos and blessing,
All arise from these three things accumulating the small to form the great.
The Sage awaits them with non-action,
Guards them with non-grasping,
Thus allowing blessing to arise spontaneously,
And calamity to vanish on its own.

It is like planting seeds—
Deeply plowed and sown thickly,
By autumn, the harvest comes naturally.
It is like being robbed—
Sitting calmly and observing attentively,
The thief will retreat on his own.

People do not understand the natural workings of things,
Believing nothing is accomplished without doing,
Nothing retained without grasping—
Thus they constantly contend with calamity,
And obstruct the growth of blessing,
So that when calamity arrives, it cannot be averted,
And when blessing comes, it cannot be completed—
Such is their inherent nature.

The people’s undertakings
Often fail just as they near completion.
If one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,
There will be no failure.

The Sage knows the harm of artificial action,
Does not aid Heaven with human effort,
From beginning to end follows what is natural—
Thus nothing remains unaccomplished.

People’s minds dwell on gain and loss,
Yet in the minutiae of all things,
There are still those who do not interfere
And let nature take its course.
When they see things nearly complete
And then recklessly disrupt them,
There is none who does not bring about their own ruin.
Thus it is said:
*Be as careful at the end as at the beginning,*
And there will be no failure.

Thus the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods;
Learns without learning,
Returns to what others have already surpassed.
To assist the natural unfolding of all things,
Yet does not dare to act.

People all follow their desires to harm things,
Trust their learning to harm principle.
The Sage is not without desire—
Desiring yet not desiring,
Thus though desiring, they do not harm things.
Not without learning—
Learning yet not learning,
Thus though learning, they do not harm principle.
Only then are they internally and externally clear and bright,
Vast and without action,
Able to assist the natural unfolding of all things,
And await their spontaneous completion.

**Chapter 65: The Chapter on Ancient Skill in the Dao/Way**
Those anciently skilled in the Dao/Way
Did not enlighten the people,
But sought to make them simple.
The so-called wise of antiquity
Knew the complete Dao/Way,
And surveyed the beginning and end of all things—
Thus they were worthy of esteem.

Common people cannot comprehend this,
And drown in petty wisdom,
Taking discernment for clarity—
Thus the harm of wisdom is great.

Therefore the Sage governs the people with the Dao/Way,
Not to enlighten them,
But to make them simple.
If they are without knowledge and without desire,
And follow what their superiors do,
Even if there are errors, they will be minor.

The difficulty in governing the people
Lies in their excessive wisdom.
Thus governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;
If I govern with wisdom, the people will counter with their own wisdom,
And the ruler and subjects will mutually destroy each other.

Not governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two principles is called *Mysterious Virtue*.
Mysterious Virtue is profound,
Far-reaching,
Contrary to the ways of things—
Only then does one attain the Great Harmony.

What I value is *virtue*.
What things value is *wisdom*.
Virtue and wisdom are inherently opposed,
Yet what wisdom follows is small,
While what virtue follows is great.

Ye said:
*Governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;*
*Not governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.*
Yet this is only a standard,
Not the Dao/Way itself—
Thus it is called *Mysterious Virtue*.
Accumulating Mysterious Virtue to its deepest and farthest extent,
One approaches the root,
And turns against the ways of things—
Only then do all things settle into their natural states,
Thus it is called the Great Harmony.

**Chapter 66: The Chapter on the King of All Valleys**
The reason the river and sea can be the king of all valleys
Is that they excel in humility,
Thus they become the king of all valleys.

Thus the Sage desires to be above others,
Yet speaks in humility;
Desires to go before others,
Yet places himself behind.

The Sage does not truly desire to be above others,
Nor to go before others.
For when one is humble and yields,
The Way itself compels one to rise and lead.

Thus the Sage, though in high station, is not resented,
Though in the forefront, is not harmed.
Therefore all under Heaven willingly follow without tiring.

Because he does not contend,
None under Heaven can contend with him.

**Chapter 67: The Chapter on the Great Way**
All under Heaven say my Way is great,
Yet seems unskilled.

Only because it is great does it seem unskilled.
If it were truly skilled, it would be trifling indeed.

The Dao is vast and formless,
Decayed and nameless,
Filling all things yet resembling none—
This is why it is great.

If it resembled things, it would be but one thing—
How could it be great?

I possess three treasures; guard and hold them:
First, *compassion*;
Second, *frugality*;
Third, *not daring to act first under Heaven.*

The Way is great because it does not resemble things,
Thus when it manifests as *virtue/power*,
It is subtle and blunt as a sharp edge,
Retreats as it advances,
And does not conform to worldly conventions.

Now, the worldly value boldness,
Praise vastness,
Boast swiftness and sharpness—
Yet what I treasure are:
Compassion and forbearance,
Frugality and restraint,
Modesty and retreat—
These three are what the world calls unskilled.

Compassion makes one courageous—
The world deems decisive boldness virtuous,
Yet calls compassion forbearance as inferior,
Not knowing that decisive boldness is easily thwarted,
While compassion and forbearance are invincible,
And in the end, will surely become courage.

Frugality makes one vast—
The world praises vastness that covers all,
Yet calls frugality meager,
Not knowing that vastness is easily exhausted,
While restraint is easily satisfied,
And in the end, will surely become vast.

Not daring to act first under Heaven,
Thus one becomes a vessel and leader.
The world deems swiftness and sharpness as ability,
Yet shames not daring to lead,
Not knowing that swiftness and sharpness often harm others,
While not daring to lead brings joy to the world,
And in the end, will surely become a vessel and leader.

For from simplicity arises utility—
The Sage employs it to become an official and leader.
From simplicity to utility,
Only then does one have those who follow as leader.

Now, if one abandons compassion and courage,
Abandons frugality and vastness,
Abandons retreat and precedence,
One is as good as dead.

Boldness, vastness, and precedence—
These are what all people detest.
To be detested by all,
Is to be near death.

Compassion, when wielded in war, brings victory;
When held in defense, brings security.
When Heaven intends to save a person,
It shields them with compassion.
To govern with compassion,
Things love them as their own parents,
Even willing to die for them without hesitation—
Thus one can wage war,
Thus one can defend.

When Heaven intends to save this person,
It opens their heart-mind,
Making them boundless in compassion,
Then all will defend them.

Zhao said:
The Way of Laozi is great—
The heart is perplexed and cannot know it,
The mouth is agape and cannot speak of it—
How could the worldly know it?

I have merely taken these three to instruct the world—
Within one passage, seven or eight out of ten are here.

Five chapters warn against war,
One chapter warns against arrogance,
Three chapters warn against extravagance and advocate frugality,
Fifteen chapters speak of gentleness, weakness, and non-contention.

Again, within these,
Compassion is paramount—
When Heaven intends to save this person,
It entrusts them with compassion—
This is called Heaven guiding their sincerity.

When Heaven intends to abandon this person,
It entrusts them with evil—
This is called Heaven seizing their vitality.

**Chapter 68: The Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior**
The virtuous warrior is not violent—
The warrior must take martial prowess as foundation,
Yet if he acts with cowardice,
If he wields martial prowess with violence, he will die.

The skilled fighter does not rage—
The Sage fights only when compelled,
If born of anger,
Then killing for my sake,
Heaven will surely punish it.

The skilled victor does not contend—
Because I do not contend,
I can overcome their clamor.
If born of contention,
I may not necessarily win.

The skilled user of people places himself below them—
All people have a desire to excel,
Thus none can truly serve them.
If one truly places himself below them,
Then all under Heaven will serve me.

This is called the *virtue/power* of non-contention,
This is called employing people’s strength,
This is called aligning with Heaven—
The ultimate principle of antiquity.

Zhao said:
To align with Heaven is the most vital principle of antiquity.

**Chapter 69: The Chapter on the Words of War**
The words of war say:

The Master Lao lamented the world’s use of arms,
Taking slaughter as the foundation,
Thus he raised the ancient records of warfare
To clarify the necessity of compelled campaigning.

I dare not be the aggressor,
But only the responder.
I do not advance an inch,
Yet retreat a foot.

The one who advances
Is he who has intent to contend.
The one who retreats
Is he who has no intent to contend.

This is called *action without action*,
Without intent to contend,
Even if arms are used or not,
The outcome remains the same. #4

Not contending with others,
Is akin to *action without action*.
To repel without force,
Yet still have no adversary,
To grasp without arms.

If there is no intent to contend,
Then even amid military campaigns,
There is no force to repel,
No adversary to confront,
No arms to wield—
How could there be blame for using arms?

Zhao said:
The law of the Great Marshal states:
When punishing, announce the crime with drums and bells,
And halt at the border.
If the enemy submits,
Then the matter is resolved—
No need to advance further.

Thus, advancing by an inch
Is often met with few gains,
While retreating by a foot
Is often met with many gains.

This, though it appears as *action*,
Is truly *action without action*; #5
Though it seems to repel,
There is no force to repel;
Though it appears to confront an enemy,
There is no adversary to rely upon;
Though it seems to wield arms,
There are no arms to hold.

No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,
For underestimating the enemy
Leads to reckless warfare,
And reckless warfare
Leads to careless killing—
Thus losing the basis of compassion.

Therefore, when opposing armies clash,
The compassionate shall prevail.
When two enemies confront and I am compelled to act,
Then I possess compassion.
When compassion is evident,
Heaven and humanity aid me—
Even if I wish not to prevail,
It cannot be avoided.

I speak of things most easy to know—**Chapter 70: The Chapter on Easy Knowing**
I speak of things most easy to know,
Most easy to practice.
Yet none under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.

The Dao is vast,
Yet sufficient to restore one’s nature—
And the subtlety of nature
Is seen in one’s daily actions,
In eating, drinking, and repose.

The Sage points to this
And shows it to the people—
Is it not easy to know?

If one embodies this
To respond to the world—
Is it not easy to practice?

Yet the world’s common affliction
Is that they use it without knowing,
And even knowing,
They cannot practice it—
Much less can they embody it!

Words have a *principle*,
Affairs have a *master*.
Only the unknowing
Is why none know me.

Words are the *Dao’s* snare,
Affairs are the *Dao’s* traces.
If the *Dao* could be fully expressed in words,
Then listening to words would suffice;
If it could be fully seen in affairs,
Then examining affairs would suffice.

Yet words cannot exhaust it,
Affairs cannot reveal it—
Only by abandoning words to seek their *principle*,
And discarding affairs to seek their *master*,
Can one attain them.

Truly, the ancient Sages
Had no scheming, no doing,
Yet there remained a *spontaneous* and unselfconscious presence—
This lies beyond the reach of thought and calculation,
Thus none ever truly know me.

Few know me,
Thus those who follow me are precious.
What the common people can know
Is not worthy of esteem.

Therefore, the Sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade.
The Sage outwardly appears the same as others,
Yet inwardly remains distinct.

Zhao said:
This chapter sets the stage for the next,
On knowing and not knowing.

The unknowing is not like the unknowing of wood or stone.
The *Dao* cannot be grasped by mere knowledge,
Nor extinguished by sensory perception,
Nor measured by emotional judgment.

The *Dao* is not obscure or void,
Yet it enters through obscurity and voidness—
This is not something the world can comprehend.

Though the world does not know it,
Only those who embody the *Dao*
Appear outwardly hidden yet inwardly steadfast—
Is this not also precious?

**Chapter 71: The Chapter on Knowing Not Knowing**
Higher than knowing is not knowing,
Lower than not knowing is knowing as a disease.

The *Dao* lies beyond thought and calculation,
Thus it cannot be known.

Yet before one knows it,
There is no way to enter without knowing;
And once one knows it and clings to that knowing,
Then it becomes a disease.

Thus, knowing while not knowing above—
Not knowing while knowing as a disease.

Guang said:
The *Dao* does not belong to knowing,
Nor does it belong to not knowing.
Knowing is false perception,
Not knowing is without strategy—
Yet when one understands the *Dao* and acts as if he does not know,
Then he preserves the truth of the *Dao* forever,
And this knowing is indeed praiseworthy.

Before one’s understanding of the *Dao*,
He stands in non-knowing;
When he probes and forces knowing,
Then he falls ill.
Lu said:
The nature of the *Dao*
Is one who does not know yet can know.

To know that one does not know,
And yet to know it with not knowing—
This is the ultimate knowing.
Though one knows that he does not know,
Yet he knows it with knowing—
His mind is then ordinary, and how could it not fall ill? #6

Only by recognizing knowing as a disease,
Is one free from disease.
Since one cannot remain in not knowing,
Nor can one remain in knowing,
Only by recognizing knowing as a disease,
Will the disease itself dissolve over time.

The Sage is not afflicted,
Because he recognizes knowing as a disease,
Thus he is not afflicted.

Zhao said:
The *Lengyan* Sutra states:
*"Knowing without seeing is knowing not knowing—this is the highest.*
*Knowing without establishing knowing is not knowing while knowing—this is the disease."*

Thus, to know that which cannot be known
And yet to cling to knowing—
This is the disease.
Only by recognizing the knowable as a disease,
Will the disease itself vanish over time.

The Sage originally has no false knowing as a disease,
For he recognizes the common people’s disease—
He establishes knowing to remove the disease of knowing,
Thus though he establishes knowing,
He is not afflicted by it.

Lu said:
Only by recognizing knowing as a disease
And treating it as such,
Does one return to non-knowing,
And knowing is no longer sufficient to afflict one.

Therefore it is said:
Only by recognizing knowing as a disease,
Is one free from disease.

Nanbo Ziqí said:
I grieve for those who destroy themselves,
I grieve for those who grieve for others,
I grieve for those who grieve for those who grieve—
Their sorrow grows ever more distant.

If Ziqí speaks once,
It is to say: *"Recognize knowing as a disease."* #7

**Chapter 72: The Chapter on the People Not Fearing Authority**
If the people do not fear authority,
Then the greatest fear will arrive.

Truly, nature itself has authority—
High and bright, vast and luminous,
Radiant beyond measure,
None can surpass it—
This is called the *greatest authority*.

「常人沉溺於眾妄，常患生死之畏懼，惮於失去所愛，萬物之威皆被棄置，終身惴惴不安，雖有大威而不自知也。

若果真能認知此理，一生死，齊得丧，坦然無怖畏，則大威赫然而現於前矣。

夫唯不厭，是以不厭。性之大，可以包容天地。彼不知者，以四肢九竅為己守，守之而不厭，是以見不出視，聞不出聽，其陋甚也。

故教之曰：勿狹其所居。彼知之者，知性之大而吾生之狹，則愀然厭之，欲脫而不得，不知有厭有慕之方囿於物也。故教之曰：勿厭其所生。

夫唯聖人不狹不厭，與人同生，與道同居，無廣狹淨穢之分辨。既不厭生，而後知生之無可厭也。

陸曰：心者，神之舍也。勿以嗜欲亵渎之，則不狹矣。神者，形所以生也。勿以多事擾亂之，則不厭矣。人不厭神，神亦不厭人，樂天矣。

詩云：亦莫留戀此名，亦莫厭惡此身。是以聖人自知不自見，自愛不自貴，故去彼取此。

聖人雖自知之，而不自見以示人；雖自愛之，而不自貴以眩人，恐人之有厭有慕也。厭慕之心未忘，則猶有畏也，畏去而後大威至矣。

冥曰：自知則明於性而不為妄，自見則矜誇，自愛則保其身而不為非，自貴則賤物。

勇於敢則殺，勇於不敢則活。知此兩者，或利或害。天之所惡，孰知其故？是以聖人猶難之。

勇於敢則死，勇於不敢則生，此物理之大常也。然而敢者或以得生，不敢者或以得死，世遂侥幸其或然，而怒其常理。

夫天道之遠，其有一或然者，孰知其好惡無從來哉？

#7

**Chapter 73: The Chapter on the Dao of Boldness and Caution**
Boldness in daring leads to death,
Boldness in not daring leads to life.
He who knows these two,
Some benefit, some harm—
What the Dao abhors,
Who can know its reason?

Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.

Boldness in daring means death,
Boldness in not daring means life—
This is the great constant of nature.

Yet those who dare may sometimes gain life,
Those who do not dare may sometimes meet death—
The world recklessly hopes for chance outcomes,
And resents the constant laws of nature.

The Dao of Heaven is vast and distant—
Its likes and dislikes have no fixed origin.
Who can truly know them?

#8

**Chapter 74: The Chapter on the People Not Fearing Death**
The people do not commonly fear death—
Why then must we frighten them with death?

When governance is perverse and punishments are excessive,
The people have no recourse—
Then they do not commonly fear death.

Even if we frighten them with death,
It will be of no use.

If we make the people fear death as a rare occurrence,
I seize and execute those who act deceitfully—
Who would dare?

The people rest secure in governance,
Commonly cherishing life yet fearing death—
Then I seize and execute those who deceive and disrupt the order,
Who would not submit?

開元曰：For those who act deceitfully, even if I seize them by force and execute,
Who would dare to do so immediately?
It is because the Heavenly law does not fail in its execution.

常有司殺者殺。
The one who executes is Heaven.
In the midst of the world’s governance,
Those who employ deceitful tactics and disrupt the order,
Act freely among us—
Then they are abandoned by Heaven.

Heaven abandons them, yet I execute them—
Then it is Heaven who executes, not I.

To replace the one who executes and carry out the execution,
Is to replace the great artisan and wield the axe.
To replace the great artisan and wield the axe,
Few would not harm their own hands.

To execute those whom Heaven has not abandoned,
Is to replace the one who executes.

To replace the great artisan and wield the axe,
Means harming one’s own hands—
To replace the one who executes,
Means harming one’s own body.

趙曰：How well did Chu灵王 speak:
*"I have killed many sons of men—
How could I avoid killing one of them?"*

With Heaven’s Dao favoring reciprocity,
This is a warning to those who delight in killing others.

Qin’s cruelty tormented the world—
This is not worth mentioning—
But to execute Li Junxian under suspicion of resemblance,
And to kill Wang Jingwen through jealousy and mistrust—
This is not the Dao of Heaven, is it?

If the Han and Tang sages,
Plotted to exterminate the eunuchs and palace attendants,
Their crimes were indeed great—
Yet Heaven did not yet abandon its abhorrence,
So there was the calamity of replacing the great artisan and harming one’s own hands—
How much worse for those who freely indulge in slaughter and execution!」

The calamities will soon follow.
Yet evil cannot be indulged, nor fortune relied upon.
In the wars of Chu and Han, in the chaos of the Five Dynasties,
those they slaughtered and exterminated—nine out of every ten households—
were indeed slain by Heaven.
How can those who do evil escape fear?

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people starve because their rulers exact too much in taxes.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers meddle too much.
Men grow reckless with death because they cling too desperately to life.
When rulers lead with their own schemes, the people respond in kind—
thus, many affairs arise and governance becomes difficult.
When rulers prioritize their own desires over the people,
the people compete to enrich their own lives—
so even in death, they will not abandon their pursuit of gain.

Only those who do not make life their concern
are wiser than those who revere it.
To revere life is to reach the utmost secrecy.
Only those who do not make life their concern
preserve their lives naturally.

*Avowal by Zhao:*
This chapter all speaks of how—
only those who do not seek to enrich life
can make death seem light.
Why then do they revere life?

**Chapter 76: The People’s Birth and Death**
When the people are born, they are soft and weak;
when they die, they become firm and strong.
Grass and trees, when born, are tender and brittle;
when they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, the firm and strong belong to death,
while the soft and weak belong to life.
When *qi* flows freely within, the body knows no rigidity.
When the ultimate principle prevails, affairs bear no burdensome strength.

Thus, armies that are strong do not conquer—
armies conquer through righteousness, not through strength.
Strength without righteousness meets swift defeat.
Trees that are too strong split.
From the moment they reach the thickness of a man’s arms, they must be felled.
The strong and great are beneath, the soft and weak are above.
This is the natural order of things:
the refined is above, the coarse is below.
The refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.

**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**
Heaven’s Dao is like drawing a bow.
When the bow is drawn, the upper sinews tighten;
when released, the upper horn relaxes—
thus, it illustrates Heaven’s raising of the high and lowering of the low.
The high are humbled, the low are elevated;
the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
Heaven’s Dao is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient.
But man’s Dao is not so:
he diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Heaven has no favorites, so it is impartial.
Man is full of bias, so he is not impartial.
Who, then, can have the excessive to bestow upon the world?
Only the sage.

The sage provides abundantly for all things without claiming credit,
and though he gives, he becomes even more so.
Though he shares, he becomes even more abundant—
none but the sage can endure this.
Thus, the sage acts without relying on it,
completes his work without dwelling on it—
is this not because he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?
If he acts and relies on it, if he completes his work and takes credit,
then virtue will be displayed in the world.
When virtue is displayed in the world,
it is because he has used the excessive to serve himself.

**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**
Nothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,
yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong—
and nothing can replace it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong—
yet the world knows this but cannot practice it.

Therefore, the sage says:
*"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the guardian of the ancestral altars;
to bear the misfortunes of the state is to be called the king of the world."*
Straight speech seems paradoxical.
Straight speech aligns with the Dao yet contradicts convention—
for convention holds that bearing filth is shameful,
and bearing misfortunes is a calamity.

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**
To reconcile great grievances will only breed further grievances—
how then can it be considered good?
Grievances arise from delusion,
and delusion stems from human nature.
Those who understand human nature do not see delusion,
and thus, what grievances remain?
Now, if one does not remove the root yet seeks to reconcile the branches,
then though outwardly reconciled, inwardly the resentment lingers.

Thus, the sage holds the left contract
without demanding accountability from others.
Therefore, the virtuous oversee the contracts,
while the unvirtuous oversee the settlements.
The left and right contracts exist
to establish trust and resolve disputes.

The sage shares this human nature with all,
yet people take delusion as normal,
chasing after contention and plunder,
unaware that their nature has never lacked delusion.
Thus, the sage reveals their true nature to them,
urging them to eliminate delusion and restore their essence.
When delusion is exhausted and essence is restored,
they will naturally attain clarity,
as the right contract matches the left—
without needing to be demanded, they will submit of their own accord.

Then, even the greatest grievances
will dissolve like melting ice,
knowing that the root was never truly there—
and what need is there for rewards?
Those without virtue, however,
wish to impose this on everyone—
yet their labor will be in vain.

*Commentary by Pan:*
The left contract is taken from others,
the right contract is given to others.
The left contract is held by those who are held accountable—
and that is all.

Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
yet it always favors the virtuous.
Heaven’s Dao is impartial,
and only the virtuous receive its favor.
The contracts are also impartial—
only those who align with them obtain them.

*Commentary by Ye:*
If someone comes to trouble me,
I only need to hold fast to my integrity and await their response—
I do not know if they will repay me.
Only then can I meet the world’s demands without labor,
just as Heaven, without favoritism, bestows upon the virtuous alone.

**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**
In a small state with few people,
Laozi was born in the declining Zhou,
where culture flourished but customs decayed—
he wished to remedy this with *wuwei*.
Thus, at the end of his book, he expressed his aspiration:
to find a small state with few people
to test his teachings—though he knew it was unattainable.

Let the people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,
yet not use them.
Let the people value death so deeply
that they do not flee far.
Let the people each content themselves with their lot,
so that those with even modest talents
are not employed by the world.

Ten or a hundred measures of grain—
those whose abilities suffice to govern ten or a hundred households.
They cherish life, so they value death;
they are content, so they do not wander far.

Though there are carriages and boats,
there is no need to ride them;
though there are armor and weapons,
there is no need to display them;

Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping and use them thus.
With few affairs and simple folk, even knotted cords suffice.
They find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful.
With inner sufficiency and no external desires, they regard what they have as beauty,
and where they dwell as delight—
and seek no more.

Neighboring states lie in sight, yet the sounds of roosters and dogs drift between them,
while the people pass their lives to old age without visiting one another.
Though goods and people abound, none seek what the other has—
for each already possesses enough.

**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech**
Trustworthy speech is not ornate,
ornate speech is not trustworthy.
Trustworthy speech is real—
thus it need not be ornate.
Ornate speech is merely appearance—
thus it need not be trustworthy.

The virtuous do not argue,
those who argue are not virtuous.
If virtue is the foundation, argument is unnecessary;
if argument is the foundation, virtue is uncertain.

The wise are not all-knowing,
the all-knowing are not wise.
If one principle unifies all things,
there is no need for vast learning.
Yet vast learning, ever increasing,
does not necessarily lead to understanding the Dao.

The Sage accumulates nothing.
The more they give to others, the more they possess;
the more they share, the more they have.
The Sage holds fast to the One alone—
they accumulate nothing else.
Yet when they deploy their abilities for others,
and extend their possessions to others,
and others are exhausted while the One remains—
only then is the value of the One known.

**Commentary by Zheng (政和曰):**
Generous giving succeeds without depletion,
yet never consumes the giver.
All things draw from it without ever being exhausted.
The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,
the Sage’s Dao acts without contention.
What can benefit can also harm;
what can act can also contend.
Yet the Sage, though capable of both,
never harms or contends.
This is how Heaven and the Sage surpass all others,
and become the source for all things.

All this is how the *Laozi* presents its teachings
and outlines its Dao in broad strokes—
thus it repeats these themes at the end.

**Zhuangzi’s Commentary (赵曰):**
Zhuangzi says the Master taught that accumulation is insufficiency,
while non-hoarding is abundance.
The Sage’s Dao is like the sea:
draw from it, yet it is never exhausted;
take from it, yet it grows deeper.
Thus, the more they give to others, the more they possess;
the more they share, the more they have.
This is what Zhuangzi calls the Heavenly Treasury,
what the Buddhists call the Limitless Storehouse.

The text concludes with the Dao of Heaven
to clarify that this Dao aligns with Heaven’s Way.
