**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Supreme Virtue That Is Not Virtue**

*"The supreme virtue is not virtue—*
*Thus, virtue arises."*

**Refined Notes:**
*"What the fragmented [Dao] does is already fully explained in the opening chapter.*
*Again, it says: ‘The common folk use it daily without knowing.’"*

**Handwritten Annotation:**
*The *Yi Ji* [Yi Commentary] states:
*"The interplay of yin and yang—this is the Dao.*
*Continuation brings forth goodness,*
*Fulfillment brings forth nature.*
*The benevolent see it as benevolence,*
*The wise see it as wisdom.*
*The common folk use it daily without knowing—*
*Thus, the Dao of the sage is rare indeed.*
*This speaks of the supreme virtue not clinging to virtue,*
*Hence, the common folk use it daily without knowing."*

*"The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—*
*Thus, it has no virtue."*

**Refined Notes:**
*"The lesser virtue progresses in application,*
*Until it scatters into singularity."*

**Handwritten Annotation:**
*"When the Dao reaches singularity,"*
*The *Zhuangzi·Xiu Xing* [Refining Nature] says:
*"The ancients dwelled in the undifferentiated,*
*In harmony with the age, attaining serenity.*
*At that time,*
*Yin and yang were in balance,*
*Ghosts and spirits undisturbed,*
*The seasons followed their course,*
*All things unharmed,*
*Life and death in their natural order.*
*Though men had knowledge, they had no use for it—*
*This is called ‘reaching singularity.’*
*At that time,*
*Actions were spontaneous, without contrivance.*
*When virtue declined,*
*With Shui Ren and Fu Xi,*
*The world began to take form—*
*Thus, order emerged, yet singularity was lost.*
*Now, Bi Xu cites this to say:*
*The lesser virtue progresses in application,*
*Until it scatters into singularity."*

*"The supreme virtue acts without action,*
*Yet nothing is left undone."*

**Refined Notes:**
*"Without thought, without deliberation,*
*The heart naturally acts without effort.*
*Forgotten merit, forgotten name,*
*Yet nothing is left undone."*

**Handwritten Annotation:**
*"Without thought, without deliberation,"*
*The *Zhuangzi·Zhi Bei You* [Knowledge’s Northern Wanderings] says:
*"Zhi wandered upon the Mysterious Waters,*
*Ascended the Hidden Well’s Fragrant Mound,*
*And encountered the Master of Non-Action.*
*Zhi asked: ‘May I ask you—*
*What thought, what deliberation leads to knowing the Dao?*
*What dwelling, what attire brings ease in the Dao?*
*From where, by what path does one attain the Dao?’*
*Three questions—yet the Master of Non-Action gave no answer.*
*Not that he refused to answer,*
*But that he did not know how.*
*Zhi, unable to ask further,*
*Returned to the south of the White Waters,*
*Ascended the Fox’s Gap,*
*And there saw the Madman Ku.*
*Zhi spoke to him in parables.*
*The Madman Ku sighed and said:*
*‘Ah! I know it—*
*I would tell you,*
*But in the midst of speaking, I forget what I meant.’*
*Zhi, still unable to ask,*
*Returned to the Imperial Court,*
*And questioned the Yellow Emperor.*
*The Yellow Emperor said:*
*‘Without thought, without deliberation—*
*This is how one knows the Dao.*
*Without dwelling, without attire—*
*This is how one finds ease in the Dao.*
*Without path, without method—*
*This is how one attains the Dao.’*
*Zhi said to the Yellow Emperor:*
*‘You and I know this,*
*Yet that one and that one do not—*
*Who is correct?’*
*The Yellow Emperor replied:*
*‘The Master of Non-Action is truly so,*
*The Madman Ku only seems so,*
*You and I shall never approach them.’"*

*Again, the *Yi Ji* says:*
*"The Master said:*
*‘What need for thought, what need for deliberation?*
*The world converges yet takes divergent paths,*
*Unified yet with myriad considerations.*
*The world’s movement stems from stillness,*
*The world’s multitude stems from singularity.*
*Thus, stillness is the root—*
*Hence, no thought.*
*Singularity is the master—*
*Hence, no deliberation.*
*Yet movement is manifold,*
*Its paths indeed divergent.*
*When one awakens to stillness,*
*Its convergence is the same.*
*The multitude is restless,*
*Its considerations myriad.*
*When one aligns with singularity,*
*Its focus is unbroken.*
*Through stillness attaining singularity—*
*What thought, what deliberation remains?*
*Thus, the sage governs the world*
*Without speech, yet all believe,*
*Without action, yet transformation spreads—*
*This is how it is attained.’*
*Hence, Bi Xu says:*
*‘Without thought, without deliberation,*
*The heart naturally acts without effort.’*
*Again, it says:*
*‘Forgotten merit, forgotten name,*
*Yet nothing is left undone.’*
*As the *Zhuangzi·Xiaoyao You* [Carefree Wanderings] says:*
*‘The Perfect Man has no self,*
*The Divine Man has no merit,*
*The Sage has no name—*
*Thus, it is said:*
*Forgotten merit, forgotten name,*
*Yet nothing is left undone.’"*

*"The lesser virtue acts,*
*Yet there is something left undone."*

**Refined Notes:**
*"The numinous aligns with yin and yang,*
*The luminous mirrors sun and moon,*
*The people all revere and obey,*
*Together rejoicing in its praise,*
*When the *lin* and *feng* appear,*
*Auspicious omens come,*
*Songs and hymns flourish,*
*And there is something left undone."*

The *Annotations* state:

*"The *Records of the Former Han* [前汉列传], Chapter Twenty-Eight, says: Public Son Hong (公孙弘), a native of Xie in the state of Mibo (苜川薛人), during the Fifth Year of Emperor Wu’s reign of *Yuan Guang* (元光), was summoned to the *Examination of the Virtuous and the Learned* (征贤良文学对策). Hong replied: ‘I have heard that when *qi* is harmonized, it follows; when sounds resonate, they respond. If the ruler above harmonizes *virtue* and *power* (和德於上), and the people below are in harmony (百姓和合於下), then the heart’s harmony aligns *qi* (心和则气和), *qi*’s harmony aligns the body (气和则形和), the body’s harmony aligns the voice (形和则声和), and when the voice is harmonized, the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and Earth responds in kind (声和则天地之和应矣). Thus, when yin and yang are harmonized, the winds and rains are timely, sweet dew descends, the five grains flourish, the six domestic animals multiply, the fine millet grows, the red grass sprouts, the mountains do not lose their trees, and the marshes do not dry up—this is the utmost harmony (此和之至也). Therefore, when the body is harmonized, there is no illness; without illness, one does not die young; thus, a father does not lose his son, nor a brother mourn his younger brother. When *virtue/power* aligns with Heaven and Earth and its brilliance matches the sun and moon, then the *lin* and *feng* appear, and auspicious omens come: the *river chart* (河图) emerges from the Yellow River, the *turtle script* (洛书) from the Luo River, and distant rulers all bring tribute, praising *Dao/Way* and offering gifts to pay homage (远方之君，莫不说义奉币而来朝). This is the supreme harmony (此和之极也). It further says: ‘When songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone’ (歌谣彰而有以为也).*

*The *Mencius·Wàn Zhāng* [万章] states: ‘Shun served as minister to Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something human strength could achieve; it was *Dao/Way* (天也). When Yao’s death was complete and the three-year mourning concluded, Shun withdrew to the south of the Nan River (南河之南) to avoid Yao’s son. The people of the realm, when they came to pay homage, went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes went not to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang their *zhuó* hymns (枢歌) did not sing them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Hence, it is said: *Dao/Way* (天也). Only then did he enter the Central States (中国) and assume the position of the Son of Heaven (践天子位焉). Now, Bi Xu uses this as his argument, saying: ‘The numinous aligns with yin and yang, the luminous mirrors the sun and moon, the people all revere and obey, together rejoicing in its praise, and when the *lin* and *feng* appear, auspicious omens come’—meaning that when songs and hymns flourish, there is still something left undone (歌彰而有以为也). This confirms the response of ‘The lesser *virtue/power* acts, yet there is something left undone’ (下德为之，而有以为).*

*When *rites* (礼) are performed, yet there is no response, then one will roll up one’s sleeves and force it (攘臂而仍之). The *Annotations* state: ‘*Rites* are *walking the Dao/Way* (履).’ It means to walk the Dao/Way and act accordingly, distinguishing between high and low, establishing noble and ignoble. The *Annotations* further say: ‘*Jade and silk* (玉帛) exchanged in tribute.’ The *Annotations* state: ‘As Confucius said in the *Rites of Lu·Yang Huò* [阳货]: ‘*Rites* say *rites*, but where is the jade and silk? *Music* says *music*, but where are the bells and drums?’ It further says: ‘*威仪* (威仪) exchanged in response.’ The *Analects·Zhōng Yōng* [中庸] states: ‘*Rites* encompass three hundred aspects, *威仪* (威仪) three thousand, and in one word: *revere* (无不敬).’ *Rites* are rooted in *reverence*, *music* in *harmony*; when there is awe-inspiring *威* (威), it is called *威*; when there is *仪* (仪) to follow, it is called *仪*. Jade and silk are the material offerings of *rites*, expressing their intent; bells and drums are the instruments of *music*, guiding its *harmony*. Thus, the essence of *rites* and *music* lies in *reverence* and *harmony*, while jade and silk, bells and drums, are their outward forms. Hence, it says: ‘*Jade and silk exchanged in tribute, awe-inspiring forms in response, raising hands and bowing, advancing and retreating with respectful glances* (玉帛交驰，威仪相答，擎跽曲拳，进退顾揖)—these are the *rites*’ outward flourishes (此礼之文也).’ Therefore, it is said: ‘This is their superficiality (故云末焉).’ If, however, they are exchanged and responded to yet there is no reciprocation, then it will escalate to rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing it (则至於攘臂而仍之也).*

*The *Annotations* state: ‘Confucius said: The greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms (大礼与天地同节).’ This is from the *Records of Rites·Yue Ji* [乐记]. It says: ‘The greatest *music* aligns with Heaven and Earth’s *harmony*, the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms. *Harmony* ensures all things flourish without harm, and *rhythm* clarifies the offerings to Heaven and Earth, the bright world of *rites* and *music*, and the hidden realm of *ghosts and spirits* (幽则有鬼神).’ The original *Annotations* mistakenly attributed this to *Zhuangzi*, but this is corrected now. It further says: ‘Taking *rites* as wings (以礼为翼), so as to act in the world (所以行於世也者).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Dà Zōng Shī* [大宗师]. Having already stated that the greatest *rites* align with Heaven and Earth’s rhythms, and now taking them as wings to act in the world, how could there ever be the chaos of rolling up one’s sleeves? *Rites*, indeed, are the thinnest expression of *loyalty and trustworthiness* (忠信), yet they are the origin of disorder (而乱之首).*

*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Zhuangzi* said: The Perfect Man practices the *teachings of the Dao/Way* without words (圣人行不言之教云).’ It says: ‘Is it not only the *Great Person* (大人) who does so?’ The *Annotations* state: This is from the *Zhuangzi·Knowing the North* [知北游]. The *Annotations*’ text has already been fully explained, so there is no need to repeat it. In essence, it confirms that *rites* are the outward adornment of the Dao/Way, yet they are the origin of disorder.*

*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*Virtue/Power* (德), *harmony* (和) also, is the utmost *trustworthiness* in action, bearing, and form, aligning with *rites* (顺乎文), which is the *rites* (礼).’ This is from the *Zhuangzi·Refining One’s Nature* [缮性]. The *Annotations*’ text is already complete, so it need not be repeated again. Thus, Bi Xu takes these passages from the *Southern Flowering* (南华) to confirm his arguments, showing that the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi on *virtue/power*, *Dao/Way*, *benevolence and righteousness*, *rites and music*, and *loyalty and trustworthiness* are never disregarded, but rather their proper order and hierarchy are clarified.*

*‘Prior recognition is the Dao/Way’s outward adornment, yet it is the beginning of folly (前识者，道之华，而愚之始).’ The *Annotations* state: ‘Using wisdom to govern the state makes it a thief (以智治国，国之贼).’ This is from the *Sixth Chapter* of the *Classic*. It has already been clarified in this section.*

*The *Annotations* further state: ‘*无思无虑* (No thought, no deliberation)’—this is the language of the *Easy System* (易系). It has already been fully explained earlier.*

*The *Annotations* state: ‘*Excessive rites lead to disorder* (礼烦则乱).’ As the upper text refers to the *Book of Documents·Shuō Mìng* [说命中]: ‘Only in the *Shuō Mìng* did the Hundred Officials gather, and then they presented themselves to the King, saying: ‘Ah! The enlightened ruler follows Heaven’s *Dao/Way* (天道), establishes states and sets up capitals. If he has goodness, he loses his goodness. If he values ability, he loses his *power* (功).’’*

「Only when all matters are attended to with preparation does one have no calamity.
Do not provoke favor nor invite humiliation,
Do not shamefully commit faults or act wrongly.
Only in their proper place does governance become pure.
Excessive offerings in sacrifice are called *pí* (pittance), yet they are said to lack reverence.
When rites become elaborate, chaos ensues;
When worship becomes excessive, difficulties arise.
Frequent sacrifices to the *qí* (cypress) tree are undesirable—
Frequent offerings lead to *pí* (pittance),
*Pí* (pittance) leads to disrespect,
Excessive worship and elaborate rites
Bring disorder and become difficult to uphold.

The King said: "Profound, Say!"
Then he spoke of *fú* (proper conduct).
Say bowed and knelt, saying: "It is not difficult to know—
It is difficult to act.
The sincerity of the *Róng* clan is not difficult,
But it harmonizes with the accomplished *virtue* of the former kings.
Say did not speak of his own merit.

Now, *Bìqū* again takes this to govern the state with *smartness*—
A thief to the state—
To verify and resolve earlier insights.
The *flowering* of the *Dao/Way* lies in *smartness* existing in human consciousness before it.
Yet when *smartness* shifts to deceit and elaborate rites bring chaos,
Is this not the *flowering* of the *Dao/Way* and the beginning of folly?

How could it compare to concealing *smartness*, concealing consciousness,
Having no thought, no deliberation,
And returning to substance and reality?

Thus, the *great man* dwells in substance, not in superficiality,
Resides in reality, not in ornamentation—
Hence, he abandons the latter and takes the former.

*The Annotations* state: "The *great man* is a vigorous, pure, and *Dao*-aligned scholar."
*The Commentary* says: "Vigorous and pure" is from the *Yì·Guàn* [乾卦文言]:
"Vigorous, pure, and precise"—
Speaking of the *great man* inheriting this vigorous, pure *qi* at birth,
Thus becoming a *Dao*-aligned scholar.
Able to abandon the superficiality of rites and *smartness*,
And take the substance of *virtue* and *power*,
This can be called fortifying the root and discarding the branches.
Hence, "abandon the latter and take the former."

*The Annotations* quote *Wénzǐ* as saying:
"The *great man* is serene without thought,
Indifferent without deliberation,
Walks where there is no path,
Roams without weariness,
Exits without doors,
Enters without rooms,
Focuses his spirit,
Lays down his perceptions,
Vacant and without action,
Yet nothing remains undone."

*The Commentary* says: This is from *Wénzǐ·Dàoyuán* [道原篇]:
"Lǎozǐ said: The *great man* refers to one who embodies the *Dao*.
Serene without thought, indifferent without deliberation,
Takes Heaven as his canopy,
Earth as his carriage,
The Four Seasons as his horses,
Yin and Yang as his duties.
Walks where there is no path,
Roams without weariness,
Exits without doors,
Enters without rooms.
Taking Heaven as his canopy, nothing remains uncovered.
Taking Earth as his carriage, nothing remains unborne.
The Four Seasons as horses, nothing remains unmoved.
Yin and Yang govern it, nothing remains unprepared.
Thus, the sage internally cultivates his root,
Externally adorns his branches,
Focuses his spirit—
*Shū* (gather), *zhú* (candle)—
This is concentration.
Lays down his perceptions,
Thus, vacant and without action, yet nothing remains undone,
Without governance, yet nothing remains ungoverned.
What is called *wuwei* (non-action) is not acting before things.
What is called *wu zhì* (non-governance) is not altering nature.
What is called *wu bù zhì* (nothing remains ungoverned) is following things as they naturally are.
Thus, *Bìqū* takes this to verify and resolve
The *great man* dwelling in substance, not in superficiality.

From *Xīzhī Déyī* [昔之得一], Chapter Thirty-Nine:
*Xīzhī Déyī*—
Heaven obtains *yī* (One), thus it is clear;
Earth obtains *yī* (One), thus it is tranquil;
The *shén* (spirit) obtains *yī* (One), thus it is responsive;
The *gǔ* (valley) obtains *yī* (One), thus it is full;
All things obtain *yī* (One), thus they flourish;
The feudal lords and kings obtain *yī* (One), thus they become the standard for all under Heaven.
This is how *yī* (One) is attained.

*The Commentary* says: *Yī* (One) is the child of the *Dao*,
The subtle and harmonious *qi*.
It is the origin of yin and yang,
The mother of all things.
When applied and utilized,
It ascends as clouds,
Descends as rain,
Scatters as wind,
Strikes as thunder—
When striking with radiance, it becomes lightning.
Unchanging from ancient times to now,
Endless from beginning to end—
*Yī* (One), its greatness is vast!

*The Annotations* state: "In yin, it shares the same *virtue*;
In yang, it shares the same waves."
*The Commentary* says: This is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Kèyì* [刻意篇].
Already detailed in the *Dàojīng* [道经].

Again, it says: "Dwelling in tiles and bricks without defilement"—
This is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Zhī Běiyóu* [知北游].
Already fully explained in Chapter Thirty-Two.
This speaks of the *Dao*’s *qi* being everywhere.

*The Annotations* state: "Motionless and still, it is called the True Sovereign;
Controlling the form, it is called the True Ruler."
*The Commentary* says: "Motionless and still" is from the *Yì* system:
"Motionless and still, yet responsive and thus communicating with all under Heaven."
Again, "True Sovereign, True Ruler" is from *Zhuāngzǐ·Qíwùlùn* [齐物论]:
"Not this without me, not me without this.
This is also close.
Yet one does not know what it employs.
If there is a True Ruler,
Yet one does not obtain its traces,
One can act in faith without seeing its form,
Having emotion without form.
A hundred limbs, nine orifices, six viscera—
All are encompassed and preserved within.
With whom shall I be intimate?
You all agree with this, do you not?
Yet there is still private inclination within it."

「If this is so, then all are merely subjects and servants, are they not?
Their subjects and servants are insufficient to govern them.
Thus, they alternately become sovereigns and subjects.
Yet there is a True Sovereign within them.

Whether one attains its essence or fails to do so,
It brings no gain nor loss to its authenticity.

*The Compilation* further cites the *Sūtra of the Western Ascension* [西升经]:
"When you obtain the One, all affairs are accomplished"—
This has already been explained in the previous passages.

*The Compilation* states: *Zhuāngzǐ* says:
"Qi is that which is empty and yet awaits all things."
Only the Dao gathers this emptiness.
Emptiness, then, is the essence of *heart-fasting* [心斋].

Again, it says:
"Within the empty hall, purity arises;
In stillness, auspiciousness abides."
*The Commentary* notes: These lines are from *Zhuāngzǐ·Rénjiānshì* [庄子·人间世].

Yán Huí [颜回] asked Confucius:
"Master, my home is poor,
Yet for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten *ru* [如] meat."
If this is so, can it be considered *heart-fasting*?

Confucius replied:
"This is the *heart-fasting* of sacrifices,
Not the *heart-fasting* of the heart."
Yán Huí asked:
"May I inquire about *heart-fasting* of the heart?"

Zhōngní [仲尼] said:
"If your will is unified,
Do not listen with your ears but with your heart,
Nor listen with your heart but with your *qi* [气].
Let listening cease at the ears,
And let your heart cease at its *symbols* [符].
*Qi* is that which is empty and yet awaits all things.
Only the Dao gathers this emptiness—
Emptiness is the *heart-fasting* of the heart."

Yán Huí said:
"Before I attained this *use* [使],
It was truly from myself alone.
When I attained this *use*,
I no longer had myself.
Can this be called emptiness?"

The Master [夫子] said:
"Exhausted indeed!
Observe the *unfilled* [阙]:
Within the empty hall, purity arises;
In stillness, auspiciousness abides.
Yet it does not remain still—
This is called *sitting while galloping* [坐驰].
What is sought and verified,
Is nothing more than this."

*The Compilation* further states: "All things derive their origin"—
This is from the *Yì·Qián* [易·乾卦] *Simu* [彖辞]:
"Great indeed is the *Qián* [乾] origin!
All things derive their origin from it."

Again, it says: "All things derive their life"—
This is also from the *Yì·Kūn* [易·坤卦] *Simu* [彖]:
"Extreme indeed is the *Kūn* [坤] origin!
All things derive their life from it.
*Kūn* [坤] is vast and bears all things,
Its virtue harmonizes without bounds."

*The Compilation* further states: "The *Spirit* [神] is that which subtly manifests all things as its words"—
This is from the *Yì·Shuō* [易·说卦] text,
Already explained in previous passages.

Now, *Bìqū* [碧虚] takes these several passages
To verify the reasoning of *obtaining the One* [得一].

The so-called *One* [一] is the *original qi* [元气].
This *original qi* can be both *yin* [阴] and *yang* [阳],
Yet it does not belong to either *yin* or *yang*.
It ascends to the *Jīng* [京] of Jade and the *Gold Gate* [金阙],
Yet it is not taken as *clear* [清].
It dwells in the *cracked earth* [瓦号] of *Lì* [荔] and *Suì* [薜],
Yet it is not taken as *impure* [浊].

The *Qián* [乾] origin uses it to derive its beginning,
The *Kūn* [坤] origin uses it to derive its life.
When it governs and controls the *manifested* [有为],
Then the True Sovereign emerges.
When it is motionless and still,
Then the True Sovereign appears.

By its utmost emptiness, it becomes the root of all life;
By its utmost fewness, it becomes the ancestor of all things.
Those who attain this:
Nothing fails to be born,
No affair fails to be accomplished,
Thus it is said: *Heaven obtains the One to remain clear* [天得一以清].

*The Compilation* states:
Even the *feudal lords and kings* [侯王], attaining this,
Are able to perpetually possess the *Great Treasure* [大宝],
Without thought, all submit.
Thus they bring peace and rectitude to the world.

*The Commentary* notes: "Without thought, all submit"—
This is from the *Máo Shī* [毛诗] *Dàyǎ·Wénwángyǒushēngpiān* [大雅·文王有声篇]:
"Hào [镐] and Jīng [京] were divided and settled,
From the west to the east,
From the south to the north,
Without thought, all submit—
Great King, your virtue is indeed vast!"

It says: "Great King, your virtue is indeed vast!"
*Huáng* [皇] means *great* [大],
*Zhēng* [烝] means *sovereign* [君].
This praises Wǔwáng [武王] for his great virtue and sovereign power.

Now *Bìqū* cites this to say:
That when Wǔwáng [武王] performed the *pìyōng* [辟雍] rites at Hào [镐] and Jīng [京],
He inspired awe and submission from all four directions,
All nations fearing and yielding—
This was also due to his attainment of the One and its rectification.

Thus it is said: *Feudal lords and kings obtain the One to rectify the world* [侯王得一以为天下正].

Heaven, without its *clearness* [清], would fear *cleavage* [裂];
Earth, without its *tranquility* [宁], would fear *upheaval* [发];
The *Spirit* [神], without its *responsiveness* [灵], would fear *extinction* [歇];
The *valleys* [谷], without their *fullness* [盈], would fear *exhaustion* [竭];
All things, without their *life* [生], would fear *annihilation* [灭];
Feudal lords and kings, without *uprightness* [贞] and *nobility* [贵高], would fear *overthrow* [蹶].

Thus, *nobility* is rooted in *humility* [贱],
And *height* is based on *lowliness* [基].
Hence, feudal lords and kings call themselves *orphan* [孤],
*widower* [寡], and *not-grain* [不谷]—
This is their way of taking *humility* as the root,
Is it not?

*The Compilation* states: "When *yin* and *yang* are disordered."
*The Commentary* notes: This is from the *Wénzǐ·Shànglǐ* [文子·上礼] text:
"When *yin* and *yang* are disordered,
The four seasons lose their sequence,
Thunder and lightning are destroyed and broken,
Frost and hail bring harm,
And all things wither and perish.
The full passage has already been recorded in the *Dàodéjīng* [道经], the thirty-first chapter, in detail.

Again, it says: "Yet the *Spirit* [神] is the *yin* and *yang* that cannot be measured"—
This has also been explained in previous passages.

*The Compilation* states:
Thus, the *drying up of the Luo* [锥] led to the decline of Xià [夏],
And the *drying up of the Hé* [河] caused the fall of Shāng [商].

*The Commentary* notes: The *Shǐjì·Zhōuběnjì* [史记·周本纪] states:
"In the second year of Yōuwáng [幽王], the three rivers of the Western Zhou [西周] all trembled.
The Western Zhou refers to Hào [镐] and Jīng [京].
The three rivers are the *Jīng* [泾], *Wèi* [渭], and *Luo* [洛].
Bóyángfǔ [伯阳父] said: 'The Zhou shall perish.'
Bóyángfǔ was the aged *Zhūxiàshǐ* [柱下史] Laozi of the Zhou.

The *qi* of Heaven and Earth does not lose its order.
If it exceeds its order, the people will be in chaos.
When *yang* is suppressed and cannot emerge,
And *yin* is oppressed and cannot nourish,
Then there is an earthquake.
Now the three rivers truly trembled—
This is *yang* losing its place and subduing *yin*.
When *yang* is lost within *yin*,
The *source* [原] must be blocked,
And when the *source* is blocked, the state must perish.

The water and soil nourish the people,
*Nourishment* [演] being *moistening* [润].
When the soil lacks nourishment,
The people lack resources,
What more awaits them than ruin?

In the past, when the *Luo* [伊洛] dried up, Xià [夏] perished.
Yǔ [禹] settled at *Yángchéng* [阳城],
Near the *Luo* [伊洛].
When the *Hé* [河] dried up, Shāng [商] perished.
The Shāng people settled at *Wèi* [卫],
Where the *Hé* [河] flowed."

Now the **Zhōu** [周] **virtue/power** [德] is like that of the last rulers of the two former dynasties. Its river sources are again blocked, and when blocked, they will dry up.

A state must depend on mountains and rivers,
For when mountains collapse and rivers dry up,
This is the sign of a fallen state.
When rivers dry up, mountains must collapse—
If a state falls, it will not exceed ten years,
This is the measure of **fate** [数].

What the **Heaven** [天] abandons does not exceed its measure.
In this year, the three rivers dried up,
And the **Qí** [岐] Mountain collapsed.
In the third year, **Yōu Wáng** [幽王] favored **Bào Sì** [褒姒],
The **Shēn** [申] Lord journeyed westward to the **Xīyí** [西夷],
And the **Quǎn Róng** [犬戎] killed **Yōu Wáng** [幽王],
Truly fulfilling the sign of a fallen state.

The **Shēn** [申] Lord was the father of **Shēn Hòu** [申后].
**Shēn Hòu** [申后] was **Yōu Wáng**’s [幽王] consort.
Favoring **Sì** [姒] and abandoning **Shēn Hòu** [申后],
This was the cause of the **Shēn** [申] Lord’s anger.

Thus **Bì Qū** [碧虚] cited it to illustrate his point,
Saying: *"When the **Zhuī** [锥] (river) dried up, Xià [夏] perished,
And when the **Hé** [河] dried up, Shāng [商] was lost,"*
To prove that **grain** [谷] cannot overflow its measure,
And to warn of the danger of depletion.

**Zhuǎn** [纂] further states:
*"The humble guard themselves with moderation."*
**Zhuó** [钞] says:
*"This refers to the *Yì·Jiān* [易·谦卦] Hexagram, Line Six: 'Humble words, humble deeds.'"*
It has already been detailed in Chapter Fifteen of the *Dào Jīng* [道经].
The preceding passages **Bì Qū** [碧虚] took to prove,
And to elucidate the principle of **"One"** [一].

If one loses this principle,
Then one invites the calamities of **cracking** [裂], **bursting** [发], **diminishing** [歇], **drying up** [竭], **extinction** [灭], and **collapse** [蹶].

Thus, to receive many praises without encouragement,
And to face many criticisms without discouragement—
This is the **Dao/Way** [道] of guarding the **"Uncarved"** [冲] **"One"** [一].

**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:
*"The world praises much but does not increase virtue,
And the world criticizes much but does not hinder it."*
**Zhuó** [钞] says:
*"The preceding text, *Zhuāngzǐ·Xiāoyáo Yóu* [庄子·逍遥游], states:
'Thus, the wise man serves one official,
Acts in accordance with one village,
Gains the harmony of one lord,
And conquers one state—
Yet in his own estimation, he is no different from this.'

Yet **Róngzǐ** [荣子] of **Sòng** [宋] still scoffs at it.
If the whole world praises you yet you do not increase virtue,
And if the whole world criticizes you yet you do not falter—
When you have firmly distinguished the divisions of inner and outer,
And clearly discerned the boundaries of honor and dishonor,
Then you have achieved it.

Thus **Bì Qū** [碧虚] cited it to illustrate his point,
Saying: 'The world praises much yet does not increase virtue,
And the world criticizes much yet does not hinder it—
How does one know what is truly honored?
How does one know what is truly dishonored?'

This is the **Dao/Way** [道] of forgetting honor and dishonor,
Yet able to preserve the **"Uncarved"** [冲] **"One"** [一],
And to establish it as the **correct order** [正] of the world."*

---

**The Reversed (反者道之动)**
**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:
*"The *Yì·Fù* [易·复卦] Hexagram says: 'The strong reverse.'*
Moving yet proceeding with gentleness,
Thus there is no harm in coming and going.

**Zhuó** [钞] says:
*"This is the *Yì·Fù* [易·复卦] **Hexagram Commentary** [彖辞].
'Fù' [复], **success** [亨].
The strong reverse,
Moving yet proceeding with gentleness,
Thus there is no harm in coming and going,
And friends come without blame.

Following its **Dao/Way** [道], in seven days it returns.
This is the **Heavenly movement** [天行].
'It is beneficial to have a place of return,'
For the strong are long-lasting.
'Fù' [复] reveals the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].

This is the time when **One** [一] **yang** [阳] first emerges.

**Bào Jí** [鲍极] **Jié** [解] says:
'The foundation of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] lies in the **Original One** [一元].
The **qi** [气] of the **Original One** [一元] resides within **Kǎn** [坎].
Below, it corresponds to the **Huángzhōng** [黄锺] **palace** [宫],
Above, it ascends to the **Qiánniú** [牵牛] **constellation** [宿],
And in the middle, it contains the **Tàijí** [太极] **radiance** [熙].

Its **substance** [体] is **stillness** [静],
Its **function** [用] is **movement** [动],
Thus it can govern the four seasons,
And transform and nourish all things—
This is the reason why it is said to be **serene yet unmoving** [寂然不动],
Yet **responsive** [感] and **penetrating** [遂] to all under **Heaven** [天].

When **movement** [动] ceases, it becomes **stillness** [静],
And when **stillness** [静] is restored, it returns to its **Original One** [元].
This occurs in the **Jiànzǐ** [建子] **month** [月], when the **Three** [三] is contained within **One** [一].

When **stillness** [静] ceases, it becomes **movement** [动],
And when **movement** [动] is displayed, its **function** [用] is revealed.
The **end** [终] returns to the **beginning** [始],
And **generation** [生] continues without limit—
The **Dao/Way** [道] is found within this.

When **One** [一] is central, it endures long,
And when it endures long, it changes.
Thus, through **movement** [动] we perceive **stillness** [静],
And through **function** [用] we perceive **substance** [体].
This means that **substance** [体] is not merely **stillness** [静],
For it is categorized by **movement** [动],
Yet its **stillness** [静] is seen.

**Stillness** [静] is the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地].
Thus the **sage** [圣人] embodies the **Original One** [元]
To establish their **sincerity** [诚],
With **stillness** [静] as their **nature** [性],
And with **movement** [动] as their **transformation** [化],
So they do not exert themselves yet achieve harmony,
Nor think yet attain understanding,
And thus align with **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地] in their **virtue/power** [德].

Those who can **shape** [造] form and **awaken** [悟]
Yet seek to return to the **Original One** [元] are **accomplished** [贤].
Thus, the **Original One** [元] is the foundation of the **sage** [圣],
And the **return** [复] is the foundation of the **accomplished** [贤],
Yet the **initial nine** [初九] of the *Yì* [易] was grasped by **Yán Shì** [颜氏].

**Yán Shì** [颜氏] grasped it,
For the *Yì·Xià* [易下击] states:
*"The noble man knows the subtle and the manifest,
Knows softness and knows strength—
This is the hope of ten thousand men."*

The **Master** [子] said:
*"Yán Shì’s [颜氏] son nearly approaches this ideal."*
There is no evil he has not known,
Yet knowing it, he has never repeated it.

The *Yì* [易] states:
*"No distant return without blame,
**Original** [元] **success** [吉]—
This is what it means."*

Thus **"return"** [复] is not the **heart** [心] of **Heaven** [天] and **Earth** [地],
But rather the ability to perceive it.

**Zhū Huì’ān** [朱晦庵] said:
*"Under accumulated **yin** [阴], **One** [一] **yang** [阳] emerges to return,
Revealing the **heart** [心] of **generation** [生]—
In humans, this is **stillness** [静] reaching its peak and then **movement** [动],
And **evil** [恶] reaching its peak and then **good** [善]."*

---

**The Weak (弱者道之用)**
**Zhuǎn** [纂] states:
*"Softness and weakness, along with **feminine stillness** [雌静],
Are truly the **functions** [用] of the **Dao/Way** [道]."*

**Zhuó** [钞] says:
*"This clarifies the **true teaching** [实教].
It speaks of softness, weakness, and humility,
As the means to enter the **Dao/Way** [道]."*

Why so?
The *Lièzǐ·Huángdì Piān* [列子·黄帝篇] states:
*"There is a **constant victorious Dao/Way** [常胜之道] under **Heaven** [天],
And there is a **non-constant victorious Dao/Way** [不常胜之道] under **Heaven** [天]."*
This text has already been detailed in Chapter Thirty-Three.

From this perspective,
Is it not clear that the **weak** [弱] are the **functions** [用] of the **Dao/Way** [道]?

Thus, it is known that the earlier passages explained the **flexibility** [权] of the **Dao/Way** [道],
And these passages elucidate its **truth** [实].

**Flexibility** [权] reverses the **classics** [经] yet aligns with the **Dao/Way** [道],
**Truth** [实] is **sincerity** [真诚] without falsity.
**Flexibility** [权] aids **truth** [实],
And **truth** [实] implements **flexibility** [权].
**Flexibility** [权] and **truth** [实] mutually rely on each other,
And neither can be neglected.

Observing the interpretation in *Guǎng Shèng Yì* [广圣义],
It states: *"The **Dao/Way** [道] first manifests in softness and weakness,
Yet the world values strength and rigidity.
Softness and weakness are the means to preserve life,
While strength and rigidity are the roots of defeat."*

This **classic** [经] states:
*"The strong and rigid do not meet their end,
And I shall use them as my **teachers** [教父]."*

Guided by this principle to instruct the world,
Let all abandon rigidity and embrace flexibility,
Let all abandon agitation and return to stillness.

Teaching has two paths—**flexibility** [权] and **truth** [实].
The superior adept comprehends sincerity,
Thus they are taught with **truth** [实],
And naturally align with the Dao/Way in profound accord.

The moderately wise and the lowly are awakened through **flexibility** [权].
If they remain unenlightened, then they are lured by **benevolent guidance** [善道].
If they refuse to follow, then they are encouraged by rewards and favors.
If they still refuse, then they are regulated by laws and decrees.
If they still refuse, then they are compelled by penalties and statutes.
If they still refuse, then they are subjected to punishments—
The five punishments: branding, nasal amputation, castration, exile, and execution.

*Do not carve the sound of the bell lightly.*

The Sage employs punishments as a last resort—
Could they have done otherwise?
*The Book of Documents* says: *"Punishments seek to eliminate punishments."*
*Seek* means to strive.
The Sage, through **flexibility** [权], establishes punishments,
Seeking only that people refrain from crime,
Not desiring to inflict punishment upon them.

*The Guang Sheng Yi* cites *The Book of Documents*:
*"When deeds are in doubt, weigh them heavily;
When guilt is in doubt, weigh it lightly.
Though punishments are set by **flexibility** [权],
They serve to restrain and encourage the people."*

The Sage’s compassionate governance and love for life are indeed profound.
Only when exhortation fails do punishments come into play.

Thus, punishments make the people fearful,
Rewards make them eager.
Eagerness drives them toward virtue,
Fear deters them from vice.
Though punishments may befall some,
It is for their own good.
And by punishing one, a hundred are deterred—
Thus, few are punished while many follow virtue.

Like combing hair,
If you comb it once every ten days, most will abandon it.
But if you comb it daily, most will keep it orderly.

「Thus, those who understand the **Dao of flexibility** [权道]—
When the sovereign applies it well, it becomes the art of ruling from the throne.
When the common scholar or layperson applies it well, it becomes the method of aligning with the Dao.
But if the sovereign or the common scholar and layperson do not apply it well,
It becomes a source of calamity instead.
Is this not something to be cautious about?

If one can return and reflect upon the origin of **emptiness and tranquility** [虚静],
And transcend the realm of being and non-being [有无],
Then strength and weakness are both forgotten,
And the distinction between **flexibility** [权] and reality [实] vanishes.
Why would one then resort to the Dao of punishments and rewards to restrain and encourage?

Therefore it is said:
*"The reverse is the movement of the Dao,
The weak is the application of the Dao."*

All things under heaven arise from **being** [有],
And **being** arises from **non-being** [无].
The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*The Liezi* states:
*"The Liezi·Tianrui Chapter* [《列子·天瑞篇》] says:
Master Liezi said:
'Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to govern heaven and earth.
Things with form arise from the formless—
How then did heaven and earth come into existence?'

Thus it is said:
There is **Primordial Simplicity** [太易],
There is **Primordial Beginning** [太初],
There is **Primordial Commencement** [太始],
There is **Primordial Substance** [太素].
**Primordial Simplicity** [太易] is before **qi** [气] appears.
**Primordial Beginning** [太初] is the beginning of **qi** [气].
**Primordial Commencement** [太始] is the beginning of form.
**Primordial Substance** [太素] is the beginning of essence [质].
When **qi**, form, and essence are present yet not yet separated,
It is called **indistinct unity** [浑沦].
**Indistinct unity** [浑沦] refers to the state where all things remain undifferentiated yet not yet distinct.

It cannot be seen,
It cannot be heard,
It cannot be grasped by following—
Thus it is called **Simplicity** [易].
**Simplicity** [易] is formless and good;
**Simplicity** changes into **Oneness** [一],
**Oneness** changes into **Sevenfold** [七],
**Sevenfold** changes into **Ninefold** [九],
**Ninefold** is the ultimate transformation—
Then it returns to change once more into **Oneness** [一],
**Oneness** being the beginning of form’s transformation.

The light and clear **qi** ascends to become the heavens,
The heavy and turbid **qi** descends to become the earth,
The harmonious **qi** [冲和气] becomes the human.
Thus it is said:
*"Heaven and earth contain the essence [精],
And all things are transformed and generated."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:
*"When form moves, it does not generate form,
But generates shadow [影].
When sound moves, it does not generate sound,
But generates echo [响].
When the void moves, it does not generate the void,
But generates being [有]."*
The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"This passage is also from the *Liezi·Tianrui Chapter* [《列子·天瑞篇》],
Quoting the *Yellow Emperor’s Book* [《黄帝书》]:*
*'Form’s movement does not generate form,
But generates shadow [影].
Sound’s movement does not generate sound,
But generates echo [响].
The void’s movement does not generate the void,
But generates being [有]."*

Form is the end,
And heaven and earth end with me and my end,
Advancing into the unknown [终进乎不知].

Now, the *Bìxū* [碧虚] takes this to illustrate:
It proves the meaning that all things under heaven arise from **being** [有],
And **being** arises from **non-being** [无].

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Scholar Hears the Dao**

The superior scholar hears the Dao,
And diligently practices it.
The middle scholar hears the Dao,
And regards it as if it exists, yet as if it does not.
The inferior scholar hears the Dao,
And laughs at it in derision.
If it is not laughed at,
It is not worthy to be called the Dao.

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"The superior scholar is of pure nature,
Tranquil and still,
Serene and unperturbed,
Void and without action.
The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*'This is from the *Zhuangzi·Kèyì Chapter* [《庄子·刻意篇》].
Already mentioned in the opening, so no need to repeat it here."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"Pure and unmixed,
Stable in **Oneness** [一] yet unchanging,
Gentle and without contrivance,
Acting yet following the natural course of heaven—
This is the Dao of nurturing the spirit [神]."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"This is what is called **naturally released bonds** [天然县解].*
The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"The *Zhuangzi·Yǎngshēngzhǔ Chapter* [《庄子·养生主篇》] says:
When the Master Laozi died,
Qin Xi, a disciple of the lost teachings, went to mourn him.
He wept three times and then left.
His disciples asked:
'Was he not your master’s friend?'
He replied:
'Yes.'"

Then is such mourning as this acceptable?

He replied: *"Indeed. At first, I thought him a man of worth, but now I see he was not. When I entered to mourn him, an elder wept as if for his own son, and a younger as if for his own mother. Their grief was not feigned—no stifled sobs, no forced tears. This was contrived mourning, betraying the truth, forgetting what they had received. The ancients called this *duàn tiān* [遁天]—a crime against heaven.

To arrive at his time was proper; to depart at his time was natural.
To dwell in the proper time and follow what is natural—
grief and joy cannot touch such a one.
The ancients called this *imperial release* [帝之县解].
Thus it is said: This is what is called **naturally released bonds** [天然县解]."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"The **middle-ranking scholar** [中士] receives a nature of moderation. The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*'Moderation'* refers to possessing **steady virtue** [中常之德].
The *Rites of Zhou* [《礼记》] has a chapter titled *The Doctrine of the Mean* [《中庸》], which expounds on the virtue of harmony and balance.
Again, in the *Analects of Confucius·Yǒngyě Chapter* [《论语·雍也篇》], Confucius says:
*'The virtue of moderation—how long has it been absent from the people!'
If one’s innate nature inherently possesses this virtue of moderation, then he may be called a **middle-ranking scholar**."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"If such a moderate scholar is not employed by the world, he will seek the marshes and wilds, dwell in secluded places, exhale the stale and inhale the fresh, striving only for cultivation.
The *Chāo* [钞] says:
This is from the *Zhuangzi·Kèyì Chapter* [《庄子·刻意篇》], which says:
*'To carve one’s intentions and pursue conduct, to abandon the world and defy customs, to indulge in lofty rhetoric and lament grievances—this is but excess.
This is the delight of **mountain-valley recluses**, not of the common world, nor of those who wither and rush to the abyss.

To speak of *rén* [仁], *yì* [义], loyalty, sincerity, reverence, frugality, and yielding—this is the pursuit of **cultivation**.
This is the delight of **ordinary scholars**, teachers, and those who dwell in study.

To speak of great deeds, to establish great names, to order the relations of ruler and subject, to rectify the hierarchy of superior and inferior—this is the pursuit of **governance**.
This is the delight of **court scholars**, those who honor their lords and strengthen their states, and those who achieve comprehensive success.

To seek the marshes and wilds, to dwell in secluded places, to fish in quiet pools—this is the pursuit of **non-action**.
This is the delight of **river-and-sea recluses**, those who avoid the world, and those who dwell in leisure.

To practice breathing exercises, to exhale the stale and inhale the fresh, to stretch like the bear and bend like the wild ox—this is the pursuit of **longevity**.
This is the delight of **导引 practitioners**, those who nurture the form, and those who attain the age of Pengzu.

But if one does not carve intentions yet remains lofty, does not practice *rén* and *yì* yet cultivates, achieves no fame yet governs, avoids no river-and-sea yet dwells in leisure, does not practice导引 yet attains longevity—
then there is neither forgetting nor possessing,
neither excess nor deficiency,
but a boundless tranquility from which all perfections arise.
This is the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**, the **virtue of the Sage**.*

Now, the *Bìxū* [碧虚] takes this to illustrate the meaning of **release as if present, if absent** [解若存若亡]."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"The **low-ranking scholar** receives a nature of coarseness and humiliation. His eyes desire to see colors, his ears desire to hear sounds, his mouth desires to savor flavors, his spirit desires to be sated. If he does not obtain these, he falls into great anxiety and fear.
The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*'The eyes desire to see colors'*—this is from the *Zhuangzi·Tiězhí Chapter* [《庄子·盗跖篇》], which says:
*'The eyes desire to see colors, the ears desire to hear sounds, the mouth desires to savor flavors, the spirit desires to be sated. And if one does not obtain these, then he falls into great anxiety and fear.'*
Again, the *Zhuangzi·Zhìlè Chapter* [《庄子·至乐篇》] says:
*'What the world holds in honor are riches, nobility, longevity, and goodness.
What it finds joy in are bodily comfort, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful colors, and pleasing music.
What it holds in contempt are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice.
What it suffers from are not obtaining bodily comfort, not tasting rich flavors, not wearing fine garments, not seeing beautiful colors, and not hearing pleasing music.
If one does not obtain these, then he falls into great anxiety and fear. How foolish to cling to such a form!*

These preceding passages serve to illustrate the differing perspectives of the **upper, middle, and lower scholars** in their understanding of release."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] further cites **Lǚ Xīshēng** [陆希声]:
*"What transcends form is called the **Dao**.
The **Dao** is what permeates beyond form.
What is beneath form is called **instrumentality**.
**Instrumentality** is what rectifies within form.
The **upper scholar** knows the subtle and the manifest, transcending beyond form.
The **lower scholar** knows only the manifest and not the subtle, confined within form."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"These words are from the *Yìjīng·Xìshuō* [《易系》].
They are already recorded in the first chapter of the *Dàodéjīng*, so no need to repeat them here.
Thus, Master Lǚ took them to illustrate the differing perspectives of the upper, middle, and lower scholars."*

There is a saying:
*"Clarifying the Dao seems like obscurity,
Making the Dao plain seems like confusion,
Advancing the Dao seems like retreat.
**Supreme virtue** seems like a valley,
**Great whiteness** seems like humiliation,
**Broad virtue** seems like insufficiency,
**Establishing virtue** seems like theft."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"A skilled merchant hides his goods as if empty,
A man of **abundant virtue** appears with a countenance of **foolishness**."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"This is the speech of Laozi teaching Confucius, as recorded in the *Shǐjì·Lièzhuàn* [《史记·列传》].
It has already been explained in the opening section."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"Wú Yún’s *Xuángāng Lùn* [《玄纲论》] states: ‘**Function** should be concealed, **faults** should be exposed.’"*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"Master Wú’s *Xuángāng Lùn* [《玄纲论》], in the chapter on ‘Establishing Function and Rectifying Faults,’ states:
‘**Function** should be concealed, **faults** should be exposed—
If **function** is concealed, it may be preserved;
If **faults** are exposed, they may be extinguished.
If **function** is not preserved and **faults** are not extinguished,
Then how could one’s name be inscribed in the **Immortal Register**?
Long life is not to be hoped for.

Yet **function** need not be grand—
When encountering things, one rescues them;
**Faults** need not be grave—
When recognizing error, one corrects it.
One need not rush to establish **function**,
Nor exhaust oneself in rectifying **faults**.
**Faults**, once corrected, should not recur;
**Function**, once established, should not falter—
This is called **daily renewing one’s virtue**,
And thus the **Heavenly Aid** comes naturally.

Because **function** should be concealed,
It is said: *‘Establishing virtue seems like theft.’*
**True substance** seems like deception.’"*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"**True substance** refers to unadulterated purity."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"Unadulterated purity—
As in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Kèyì* [《庄子·刻意》]:
‘He who embodies **pure simplicity** is called the **True Person.’**"

*"The **Great Square** has no corners."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"**Dì** [砥] and **Lì** [砺] are names for sharp edges,
Used to create **Kāng** [康] and **Yú** [隅]—
This refers to those bound by **orthodox teachings**.
**Dì** and **Lì** are both grinding stones;
**Dì** is finer than **Lì**, both used for smoothing.
The *Shī* [《诗》] says:
‘As smooth as **Dì**,
As straight as an arrow’—
This is derived from them."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"Those bound by **orthodox teachings**—
As in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Qiūshuǐ* [《庄子·秋水》]:
‘The North Sea said:
*A frog in a well cannot be spoken to about the sea—
Its dwelling is too confined.
A summer insect cannot be spoken to about ice—
It is too attached to its time.
A narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to about the **Dao**—
He is bound by his teachings.*
This is why he is laughed at by those of the **Great Square**.’"*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"Grinding without leaving a mark,
Staining without becoming black—
This is the **Great Square**.’"*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"As in the *Lǔyǔ·Yánghuò* [《鲁语·阳货》]:
‘Fú Tán [佛胖] summoned [Confucius].
The Master intended to go.
Fú Tán was the steward of Zhōu Jiānzǐ [赵简子] in Zhòngmóu [中牟].
Zǐlú [子路] said:
‘Earlier, I heard the Master say:
*“If someone close to the ruler commits wrongdoing,
A gentleman does not enter.”*
Now Fú Tán has rebelled in Zhòngmóu,
And yet you intend to go—how can this be?’
The Master said:
‘Indeed, there was such a saying.
But is it not said:
*“Not firm enough to be ground without leaving a mark?”*
*“Not white enough to be stained without becoming black?”*
Am I a gourd or a melon?
How could I be bound and not eat?’*
This is what is meant by the **Great Square**.’"*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:
*"Actions should not be excessively eccentric."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"As in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Tiāndì* [《庄子·天地》]:
‘To differ without differing is called **Great**;
To act without eccentricity is called **Broad**—
Such **Broadness** and **Greatness** is called the **Great Square**.
If there is differing, it is not the **Great Square**.’"*

*"Great vessels take long to complete."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"Great vessels—
Like the **Nine Cauldrons** and **Húluán** [瑚琏],
Cannot be finished in a single day."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"The **Nine Cauldrons**—these are great cauldrons.
The *Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn* [《黄帝内传》] says:
‘The Yellow Emperor mined copper from Tóushǒu Shān [首山],
And cast the cauldron at Jīngshān [荆山], now the southern outskirts of Lake City,
Which is also called **Jīngshān** or **Zhùdǐngyuán** [铸鼎原].
Some say it was cast by Xià Yǔ [夏禹].
Zèngzǐ Gù [曾子固] in the *Quánzhēn Táng Jì* [《全真堂记》] says:
‘The nine regions contributed gold,
And Xià Yǔ cast them into the **Nine Cauldrons**,
Within which were depicted the mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, birds, and beasts of the nine regions.
Thus, it is known that they were cast by Xià Yǔ.’

As for **Húluán** [瑚琏]—
In the *Lǔyǔ·Gōngyězhǎng* [《鲁语·公冶长》]:
Zǐgòng [子贡] asked:
‘How would you assess me?’
The Master said:
‘You are a vessel.’
He asked:
‘What kind of vessel?’
The Master said:
‘A **Húluán** [瑚琏].’
Bāo [包] said:
‘**Hú** refers to the vessels for millet and rice;
In Xià, it was called **Hú**,
In Yīn, it was called **Chán** [缠],
In Zhōu, it was called **Dòngluán** [董篮]—
These were the most noble vessels for ancestral temples and sacrifices.’

Now, these **Nine Cauldrons** and **Húluán**—
They are the most complete, grand, and noble of vessels.
Their creation was not accomplished in a single morning or evening.
Similarly, how could the **Worthy and Sage** achieve their worthiness and sagacity
Without years of effort and deeds?
Yet accumulated habits become natural,
And perfection arises from enduring time.
Thus it is said: *‘Great vessels take long to complete.’*

Again, perfection arising from enduring time—
As in the *Zhuāngzǐ·Rénjiānshì* [《庄子·人间世》]:
Lèigōng Zǐgāo [叶公子高] was about to be sent as an envoy to Qí [齐],
And he consulted Zhòngní [仲尼].
Zhòngní instructed him.
Thus, the *Fǎyán* [法言] says:
‘Do not urge what is not yet ripe,
Nor hasten what is not yet complete—
Exceeding the proper measure harms progress.
Urging what is not yet ripe and hastening what is not yet complete
Are perilous to affairs.
Perfection arises from enduring time,
And what is flawed cannot be rectified once complete—
How can one not be cautious?’"*

*"Heaven alone follows the **Dao**,
Generously lending and completing."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"Only this **Mysterious Dao** can move **spirits and gods**,
Give birth to **Heaven and Earth**."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"This is the text from the *Zhuāngzǐ·Dàzōngshī* [《庄子·大宗师》].
It has already been fully recorded in the opening chapter of this scripture,
So it is not repeated here.
In essence, it speaks of how the **Great Dao** generously lends itself to all things,
And all things draw upon it to take form."*

*"Chapter 42: The **Dao** Generates One"*
*"The **Dao** generates **One**,
**One** generates **Two**,
**Two** generates **Three**,
**Three** generates **Ten Thousand Things**."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"**Húnyún** [浑沦] is **One**—
**Húnyún**, the undifferentiated **qi**,
Before separation and dispersion."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"**Húnyún**—
This is the text from the *Lièzǐ·Tiānrú* [《列子·天瑞》].
It has already been fully recorded in Chapter 40 of this scripture,
So it is omitted here."*

*"All things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,
And the **Harmonizing Qi** completes them."*

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
*"If a gentleman does not disturb his **heart**,
Then the **浩然** *hàorán* **qi** may be nurtured."*

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*"The preceding text comes from the *Mèngzǐ·Gōngsūnchǒu Zhāngjù Shàng* [《孟子·公孙丑章句上》].
Gōngsūnchǒu [公孙丑] asked:
‘If the Master were to become a high official in Qí [齐],
And could put the **Dao** into practice,
Even if he thereby became a **Conqueror-King**, it would make no difference.
In such a case, would the Master’s **heart** still be unsettled?’
Mèngzǐ said:
‘No, at forty, my **heart** does not move.’
He asked:
‘If that is so, then the Master surpasses Mèng Rèn [孟轲] by a great margin.’"*

「Gōngsūnchǒu said:
“This is not difficult. **Gèzǐ** [告子] first achieved *bùdòngxīn* [不动心] before me.”

**Gèzǐ** [姓告名不害], whose surname is Gè [告] and given name is Bùhài [不害].
“Zǐ [子]” is a general term for males.
**Mèng Rèn** [孟贲] was brave in strength, but I am brave in **virtue and righteousness** [德义], hence I say, “This is not difficult.”
Since **Gèzǐ** [告子] had not yet reached forty with *bùdòngxīn* [不动心], it is said he surpassed me, let alone **Mèng Rèn** [孟子]!

Gōngsūnchǒu asked:
“May I venture to ask how the Master’s *bùdòngxīn* [不动心] differs from **Gèzǐ**’s *bùdòngxīn* [不动心]? Can I hear the explanation?”

**Gèzǐ** [告子] replied:
“If you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**.
If you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**.
If you cannot grasp it in the **heart**, do not demand it of the **qi**, then [you may proceed].
If you cannot grasp it through words, do not demand it of the **heart**, then [you cannot].

“The **志** *zhì* is the **qi**’s commander.
The **qi** fills the **body** [体].
The **heart** and **志** are where thoughts and deliberations arise.
The **qi** is what fills and satisfies the form and body, giving rise to joy and anger.
The **志** commands the **qi** and sets it in motion, determining its suitability or not.
When the **志** is set, the **qi** follows.
The **志** is the most essential foundation, while the **qi** follows and adapts to it.
Hence it is said: **Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage** [持其志，无暴其气].
*Bào* [暴] means disorder.
It means that when the **志** is directed, the **qi** will follow—so one must firmly hold to the **志**, lest it be disordered, and then the **qi** will remain stable, allowing joy and anger to act upon others.

Having said, “The **志** is set, the **qi** follows,”
And also, “**Hold fast to your志, and do not let your qi rage**,”
Why is this so?

It is because:
When the **志** is unified, it moves the **qi**,
And when the **qi** is unified, it moves the **志**.
*Chá* [查] means stagnant and unexpressed.
Now, those who hurry and rush—
This is their **qi**, yet it turns back and disturbs their **heart**.
**Mèngzǐ** spoke of how a person’s **志** and **qi** become confined and stagnant, thus unified.
When the **志** is confined, the **qi** cannot move freely,
And when the **qi** is confined, the **志** cannot express itself.
Those who now walk with a furrowed brow—
It is because their **qi** is blocked and they cannot control themselves,
So their **志** and **qi** become inverted.
Between inversion and stagnation, there is no way to avoid movement and fear.

Thus, the **志** and **qi** assist each other.
May I ask how the Master excels?

The Master replied:
“I know how to speak, and I am skilled at nurturing my **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**.”

May I ask what is meant by **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**?

The Master replied:
“It is hard to explain.
This **qi** is supremely vast and robust,
Nurtured with uprightness and without harm,
Then it fills the space between heaven and earth.
This **qi**, when aligned with **righteousness** [义] and the **Dao/Way** [道],
Lacks it, and it withers.
This is the **qi** born from gathering **righteousness** [义],
Not seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.
*Jí* [集] means intermingling.
It means that **浩然** *hàorán* **qi** arises naturally from its mingling with **righteousness** [仁义],
Not from artificially applying **righteousness** to take it.
Hence it is said: “This **qi** is born from gathering **righteousness**,
Not seized by **righteousness** clinging to it.”
If one’s actions do not conform to the **heart**’s intent,
Then it withers.
*Zhuàn* [赚] means swift and harmonious.
When one reflects inwardly and finds that their practice of **righteousness** [仁义] is incomplete,
Harming the **浩然** *hàorán* **qi**,
Then they suffer from a gnawing hunger in their chest.
Hence, things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose.

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
“Those who humble themselves to cultivate their **virtue** [德].”

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
“This is the *Yì·Tiǎn* [《易·谦卦》] initial sixth line’s text.
It has been repeatedly explained before, so it will not be repeated here.”

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
“Through humility, one receives benefit.”

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
“The *Shàngshū·Dàyǔ Mó* [《尚书·大禹谟》] states:
‘**Yǐ** [益] praised **Yǔ** [禹], saying:
“Only **virtue/power** moves heaven,
Reaching even the most distant without fail.
Fullness invites loss, humility invites gain—
This is the **Dao/Way** of heaven.”

Now, **Bìxū** [碧虚] takes from *Lìzǐ* [《列子》] the passage where **qi** and form are complete yet undivided,
Hence it says: *“The undivided”* [浑沦], to illustrate the meaning of the **Dao/Way** giving rise to unity.
Again, it takes **Mèngzǐ**’s *“浩然”* [浩然] to illustrate the meaning of the **Harmonizing Qi** completing all things.
Again, it takes the *Yì* [《易》]’s *“谦卦”* [Tiǎn Coordinate] passage *“Through humility, one cultivates oneself”* [卑以自牧],
And the *Shū* [《书》]’s *“Dàyǔ Mó”* [《大禹谟》] passage *“Through humility, one receives benefit”* [以谦受益],
To illustrate the meaning of *“Things may either be lost to gain or gained to lose”*.
Finally, it concludes with *“The strong **粱** [strong grain] cannot find its proper end”* [强粱者不得其死],
And I will take this as my **teacher** [教父],
Whose sincere admonitions and exhortations to the world are profound indeed.

**Chapter 43: The Ultimate Softness of the World** [天下之至柔]
*Wúyǒu* [无有] enters into *wújiàn* [无间].

The *Zhuàn* [纂] says:
“**Zhuāngzǐ** [庄子] said:
‘Gold and stone cannot be pierced—
Without them, there is nothing to resound.’

The *Chāo* [钞] says:
*The *Zhuāngzǐ·Tiāndì* [《庄子·天地篇》] states:
“The Master said:
‘The **Dao/Way** [道] dwells deep within—
Its sound is vast and clear.
Gold and stone cannot be pierced—
Without them, there is nothing to resound.
Gold and stone have sound,
But without striking, they cannot resound.
Who among all things can truly stabilize them?’

Now, **Bìxū** [碧虚] uses this to explain:
That gold and stone are firm and impenetrable objects.
Yet when struck, they produce sound—
This is because they internally harbor **Dao/Way qi** [道气], making them so.
The **Dao/Way qi** is *wúyǒu* [无有].
Gold and stone are *wújiàn* [无间].
Now, this **Dao/Way** of emptiness and void,
Able to enter gold and stone,
Is it not precisely *wúyǒu* entering *wújiàn*?

I have heard in *The Book of Transformation·Dao/Way of Transformation* [《化书·道化篇》]:
‘The dragon died on **Chǒuyáng Shān** [首阳之山].
The distinction between reality and illusion is so clear.’

The *Zhuàn* [纂] further says:
“Yet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—
Are they merely caught between leisure and suffering, joy and pain?
This is also from *The Yáng Zhū Pian* [《扬朱篇》].
**Chángzǐ** [常子] said:
‘Abandon the **命令** *mìnglìng* [fixed rules], and there will be no suffering.’
**Lǎozǐ** [老子] said:
‘**Name** [名] is the **guest** of the **real** [实].’
Yet those who are **悠悠** *yōuyōu* [lofty and detached] rush after fame without end—
How can **Name** be abandoned?
How can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?

Now, having a **Name** brings honor and respect,
Lacking a **Name** brings disgrace and shame.
Honor and respect bring leisure and joy,
Disgrace and shame bring suffering and pain.
Suffering and pain are what offend one’s **nature** [性],
While leisure and joy are what align with one’s **nature**.
This is where the **real** is tied!

How can **Name** be abandoned?
How can **Name** be a **guest** of the **real**?
Only that one should hate those who cling to **Name** and burden the **real**.
Clinging to **Name** and burdening the **real**—
This is what leads to the failure to save the perishing,
And how can one merely be caught between leisure and suffering, joy and pain?

Hence, **Bìxū** [碧虚] takes these passages,
To illustrate the distinction of whether **Name** or **body** [身] is closer to one’s self.»

The *Zhuàn* further states: The likes of Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī were those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.

The *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: Bào Jiāo and Zǐ Tuī—
The *Zhuāngzi·Táo Zhí* [盗跖] chapter states: *"Bào Jiāo adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms, embracing death by clinging to a tree. His surname was Bào, given name Jiāo, a recluse of the Zhou era. He adorned his conduct beyond the world’s norms; maintaining purity and integrity, he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance. He did not serve the Son of Heaven nor associate with feudal lords. Zǐ Gòng encountered him and said, ‘I have heard that one should not tread upon lands whose governance one disapproves, nor accept benefits from a ruler one deems corrupt. Yet you walk upon this land and consume its benefits—is this acceptable?’ Bào Jiāo replied, ‘I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but scorns retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly regard death.’ Thus, he embraced the tree and withered away."*

Jìe Zǐ Tuī was the epitome of loyalty, having cut his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Wén Gōng betrayed him, Zǐ Tuī departed in anger, embracing a tree until he perished in flames.

In the past, when Jìn Wén Gōng (Zhòng Ēr) was young, he faced the hardship of his stepmother Lì Jī’s plot. Lì Jī’s son was Yí Jiù. She sought to dethrone Zhòng Ēr and establish Yí Jiù, repeatedly slandering him to Xiàn Gōng. The king believed her, and Zhòng Ēr fled into exile. Along the way, starving, Zǐ Tuī cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Wén Gōng. Later, when Zhòng Ēr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers but forgot Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed the *Lóngshé* [龙蛇] song, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. The king then regretted his neglect and pursued Zǐ Tuī to Jiè Shān—also called Mián Shān. When Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge, the king set the mountain ablaze. Though flames surrounded him, he did not flee but perished, clinging to a tree.

Now, Bìxū [碧虚] discusses these two men as examples of those who clung to **Name** and burdened the **real**.

Between **body** and wealth, which is more burdensome?
The *Zhuàn* states: The wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected.

The *Jiǎo* [钞] cites the *Zhuāngzi·Zhì Lè* [至乐] chapter: *"What the world esteems are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful women, melodious music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are bodily discomfort, lack of delicacies, unattractive attire, unpleasing sights, and discordant sounds. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. Thus, the **body** is treated as a mere tool."*

The wealthy toil endlessly, amassing riches they cannot fully enjoy—thus, their **body** is enslaved externally. The noble labor night and day, fretting over right and wrong—thus, their **body** is neglected. Human life is born with sorrow; the long-lived grow dull, enduring prolonged suffering without end—how far their **body** is from true ease!

From this perspective, the wealthy and noble pursue **Name** and sacrifice for gain, bearing lifelong sorrow and knowing no true joy. Thus, Bìxū [碧虚] cites this to illustrate which is more burdensome—**body** or wealth.

Between gain and loss, which brings greater affliction?
The *Zhuàn* states: Zhuāngzi said, *"Those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**."*

The *Jiǎo* [钞] explains: This is from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* [让王] chapter: *"Zēngzǐ, residing in Wèi, wore tattered robes with no lining, his face swollen and discolored. His hands and feet were calloused, and for three days he did not light a fire; for ten years, he did not mend his clothes. His hat’s ribbon frayed, his sleeves were threadbare, and his sandals were worn through. Dragging his tattered garments, he sang the *Shāng Sòng* hymns, his voice filling heaven and earth like chimes and bells. Neither the Son of Heaven could command him as a subject nor feudal lords as a friend. Thus, those who cultivate their **mind** forget the **body**; those who nourish the **body** forget gain; those who attain the **Dao** forget the **heart**."*

Here, the *Zhuàn* further cites two passages from the *Zhuāngzi·Ràng Wáng* chapter—both complete in themselves—without need of repetition, to illustrate which brings greater affliction: gain or loss, and the meaning of *"knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace."*

---
**Chapter Forty-Five: Dàchéng Ruò Quē [大成若缺]**
Great completion resembles deficiency,
Its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness resembles emptiness,
Its use is boundless.

「He said: *"You are heading toward the Great Abyss."* He asked: *"What is the purpose of this?"*
He replied: *"The Great Abyss, as a thing, is filled yet never overflows, drawn from yet never exhausted. I intend to wander there."*
Thus, **Bìqū** employs this to illustrate the meaning of *"its use is inexhaustible."*

The Great Abyss refers to the **Great Sea**.

As for the meaning of *"clear mirror"* (**Míngyíng**), it has already been fully elucidated in Chapter Twenty-Five.

**Bìqū** further states:
*"Those who possess great virtue and grand undertakings"*—the **Quánshū** records:
*"‘Great virtue’ is called ‘renewal’ (xīn), and ‘grand undertakings’ are called ‘wealthy abundance’ (fùyǒu)."* (This is from the *Yì Jì* commentary.)

*"Great virtue and grand undertakings are indeed consummate!"*
Hence, **Bìqū** selects this to explain that one who attains such great virtue and such grand undertakings may be called *"great fullness."* Yet, their outward demeanor remains ever humble and unassuming, never arrogant.
Moreover, even when wealth and nobility fill the halls and chambers—gold and jade adorning every room—they can still maintain frugality and simplicity, never extravagant.
Thus, their use is always abundant with surplus, never depleted or exhausted.

*"Great skill resembles clumsiness"* (**Dàqiǎo ruò zhuō**):
The **Zhuàn** cites the *Lièzǐ* as saying:
*"A man of Sòng, crafting leaves of jade for his lord, did not rely on his cleverness and skill."* (This is from the *Lièzǐ·Shuō Fú* chapter.)

The **Quánshū** notes:
*"This text is from the *Lièzǐ·Shuō Fú* chapter."*

The **Zhuàn** states that the beginning and end are complete, requiring no repetition.

*"Great skill resembles clumsiness"*:
The **Zhuàn** cites **Zhuāngzǐ** as saying:
*"He who covers and sustains the heavens and earth, carves and shapes all forms, yet does not consider himself skilled—how could one who merely crafts jade leaves for his lord be deemed skilled?"*

*"Great eloquence resembles inarticulateness"* (**Dàbiàn ruò nè**):
The **Zhuàn** notes:
*"One who does not speak against what is not lawful."*

The **Quánshū** records:
*"This is from the *Xiàojīng* (Classic of Filial Piety), in the chapter on 'Qīngdàfū' (Noblemen and Great Officers), where it states:
'If it is not the lawful attire of the ancient kings, I dare not wear it. If it is not the virtuous conduct of the ancient kings, I dare not practice it. If it is not the proper speech of the ancient kings, I dare not utter it. Thus, I do not speak against what is not lawful, nor act against what is not the Way. My words fill the world without error, my conduct fills the world without grievance. When these three are complete, then one can safeguard their ancestral temples. This is the filial piety of noblemen and great officers.'

The *Shī* (Odes) says:
*'Day and night without slackness, serving one person.'*
This serves as evidence to elucidate the meaning of 'not speaking against what is not lawful.'

The **Zhuàn** further notes:
*'One who does not speak against what is not proper (礼).'*

The **Quánshū** records:
*"This is from the *Lúnyǔ* (Analects), in the *Yán Yuān* (Preface to Yan Yuan) chapter, where it states:
Preface to Yan Yuan asked about *rén* (benevolence). The Master said:
*'To restrain oneself and return to propriety is benevolence. Restraint—this is self-discipline. Return—this is restoration. When one’s self can restore propriety, then one is benevolent. If one day restrains oneself and returns to propriety, all under Heaven will turn to benevolence. The practice of benevolence depends on oneself—how could it depend on others?'*

Yan Yuan said:
*'May I ask its particulars?'*

The Master said:
*'Do not look at what is not proper, do not listen to what is not proper, do not speak of what is not proper, do not act on what is not proper.'*

Yan Yuan said:
*'Though I am dull-witted, I will act upon these words.'*

Thus, it is said: *'One does not speak against what is not proper.'*
Now, **Bìqū** selects these instances of 'not speaking against what is not lawful' and 'not speaking against what is not proper,' meaning he does nothing contrived, hence his speech seems inarticulate.

Moreover, it is heard that Confucius said:
*'The superior man desires to be inarticulate in speech yet swift in action.'*
This is also the same meaning.
Thus, it is said: *"Great eloquence resembles inarticulateness."*

*"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat; clarity and tranquility are the true essence of the world."*

The **Zhuàn** cites **Zhuāngzǐ** as saying:
*"Embrace the numinous with stillness, and the form will naturally align itself—thus one may attain longevity."*

The **Quánshū** records:
*"This is from the *Zhuāngzǐ*, in the *Zàiyòu* (On Nurturing Life) chapter."*

The twenty-first chapter has already been fully elaborated. Therefore, Bìqū cites these passages to illustrate the principle of *"clearing and stillness as the true essence of the world."*

**Chapter Forty-Six: When the Dao Prevails in the World**

*"When the Dao prevails in the world, warhorses are driven back to manure the fields."*

The **Zhuàn** states: *"When the Dao prevails in the world"* refers to a time of great prosperity.

The **Quánshū** records: *"Speaking of a time of great prosperity"*—this is from the *Tàiqǔ* (Co-Partnership) hexagram of the *Yìjīng* (Book of Changes), where **Kǎn** (Earth) is below and **Qián** (Heaven) above.

*"Tài"*—when the small yields to the great, it brings auspiciousness and flourishing.
The *Xiàng* (Judgment) states: *"Tài—when the small yields to the great, it brings auspiciousness and flourishing."* This signifies the interaction of Heaven and Earth, allowing all things to flourish. The upper and lower realms interact harmoniously, their intentions aligned. Within, there is **yang** vitality, and without, there is **yin** compliance; within, the **junzi** (noble one) prevails, and without, the petty folk decline—thus, the Way of the **junzi** thrives, while the Way of the petty folk wanes.

The *Xiàng* states: *"Heaven and Earth interact—this is Tài."*

Later sages followed this principle, completing the Way of Heaven and Earth, assisting and harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s natural order, to govern the people from both sides.

Now, Bìqū cites these passages to explain that in a time of great prosperity, all things flourish, ancestral temples shine, the realm is at peace, and the feudal lords come as guests. Even the common folk live in joy and contentment—such is the state when the Dao prevails in the world.

*"When the Dao does not prevail in the world, warhorses are bred in the suburbs."*

The **Zhuàn** states: *"When the Dao does not prevail in the world"* refers to a time of decline.

The **Quánshū** records: *"Speaking of a time of decline"*—this is from the *Pǐqǔ* (Opposition) hexagram of the *Yìjīng*, where **Kǎn** (Earth) is below and **Qián** (Heaven) above.

*"Pǐ"*—the unprincipled do not prosper; it is not advantageous for the **junzi** to maintain integrity, as the great yields to the small.
The *Xiàng* states: *"Pǐ—the unprincipled do not prosper; it is not advantageous for the **junzi** to maintain integrity, as the great yields to the small."* This signifies that Heaven and Earth do not interact, and all things do not flourish. The upper and lower realms do not interact, and the world lacks order. Within, there is **yin** passivity, and without, there is **yang** rigidity; within, the petty folk prevail, and without, the **junzi** decline—thus, the Way of the petty folk thrives, while the Way of the **junzi** wanes.

The *Xiàng* states: *"Heaven and Earth do not interact—this is Pǐ."*

The **junzi** should cultivate frugality in virtue to avoid misfortune and should not seek honor through wealth.

Now, Bìqū cites these passages to explain that in a time of decline, official duties are neglected, the ruler is troubled, the treasury is depleted, and calamities of flood and drought occur frequently. The separation of **yin** and **yang** leads to suffering among all living beings—such is the state when the Dao does not prevail in the world.

*"No greater crime exists than indulging in desire."*

The **Guī** begins:

**Initial Nine:** *Lǚ xiào miè zhǐ, wú jiù.*
*"The fetter destroys the toe—no blame."*

**Image (Xiàng):** *"The fetter destroys the toe—[this signifies] non-action."*

**Explanation:**
*Xiào* refers to restraints—such as the wooden stocks used for offenders like the *shù zǔ* (ancestral trees of guilt, e.g., *guì* or *jú*).
*Zhǐ* means the foot. Now, in the case of the **Initial Nine**, at the outset of transgression, the fetter binds the foot—this is to compel reform, yet the offender refuses to abandon wrongdoing. Later, in the **Upper Nine**, when the fault is already grave, the offender still refuses repentance, accumulating guilt until it becomes irredeemable, culminating in extreme punishment. Thus, the fetter is applied to the ear, blinding the mind—this is what *"the fetter destroys the ear, and wisdom is obscured"* truly means.

Hence, it is said: *"The fetter destroys the ear, and wisdom is obscured."* Therefore, the *Zhuàn* states: *"Those who indulge in arrogant extravagance will inevitably meet the calamity of the fetter."* And since the calamity of the fetter originates from yielding to desire, no greater crime exists than indulging in desire.

The *Zhuàn* further cites: *"The man of Qi seized gold."*
The *Chāo* notes: *"This is the concluding passage of the *Lièzǐ·Yuè Fú* chapter."*

The *Zhuàn*’s text is now complete, and thus no further elaboration is given.

「The *Zhuàn* says: *"He who gazes upon turbid waters and loses himself in clear springs."* The *Chāo* notes: *"This is from the *Zhuāngzǐ·Shān Mù* chapter."* **Zhuāng Zhou** wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, where he saw a strange crow from the southern lands—its wingspan seven feet wide, its eyes as large as a *yùn* measure (inch), drawn to his scent and alighting in the **Lìlín**. Zhuāng Zhou said: *"What kind of bird is this? Its vast wings do not soar, and its great eyes do not perceive."* He raised his hem and quickened his steps, plucked a pebble and hurled it, causing the crow to retreat. He saw a cicada, basking in the fine shade and forgetting its own body; the mantis seized its wings and struck at it, seeing its prey and forgetting its own form; the strange crow swooped down to take advantage, seeing profit and forgetting its true nature. Zhuāng Zhou sighed and said: *"Alas! Things are indeed bound to one another, and the two types call to each other."* He discarded the pebble and turned back, but the **Yúrén** (keeper of wildfowl) pursued him, criticizing his actions and questioning his motives. Zhuāng Zhou returned home, and for three months he did not attend court. **Lán Qiè** and **Zǐyú** came to ask him: *"Master, why have you been so absent from court these days?"* Zhuāng Zhou replied: *"I have preserved my form and forgotten my body, gazing upon turbid waters and losing myself in clear springs. Moreover, I have heard from my teacher that, ‘Enter their customs, follow their ways.’ Now I wander in the **Diāolíng** wilderness and forget my own body; the strange crow is drawn to my scent, alighting in the **Lìlín** and forgetting its true nature, while the **Yúrén** of **Lìlín** takes me as their quarry. Hence, I have not attended court."* Now taking this as a parable, it is said that those who are bewildered by desire rarely escape its punishments. Just as Zhuāng Zhou wandered in the **Diāolíng** wilderness, gazing upon turbid waters and losing himself in clear springs. Therefore, **Bìxū** (the Daoist sage) says: *"No greater calamity than seeking what one desires."* The *Zhuàn* further says: *"There is none left untouched."* The *Chāo* notes: *"Referring to the *Máo Shī·Dàyǎ·Yún Hàn* chapter, which states: ‘The Milky Way follows the Chou Duke, follows the Chou Duke, the great official of the Zhou.’ It praises King Xuan of Zhou. When the drought was severe, it could not be dispelled, and he worked tirelessly in fear, like thunder and lightning, saving the people of Zhou—none were left untouched. Here, ‘dispelled’ means ‘removed.’ ‘Tirelessly’ signifies ‘dread,’ and ‘dangerous’ denotes ‘fear.’ It says that King Xuan of Zhou, anxious about the excessive drought of his time, labored tirelessly in dread, like thunder and lightning striking overhead, so that none of his people were left alone to escape the calamity. Now **Bìxū** takes this ‘none left untouched’ to mean otherwise. He blames those who covet all things under heaven, whether seen or unseen, desiring to possess them all, leaving none untouched, so that everything is under their control—this is no greater excess than their insatiable greed. How much less can it be confined to harming just one person? This calamity must surely extend to their descendants and future generations. Hence, it is said: *‘No greater calamity than seeking what one desires.’* Chapter Forty-Seven: *"Knowing the world without leaving one’s door."*

The *Zhuàn* says: *"When one eats, he thinks of those who hunger in the world; when one clothes himself, he thinks of those who shiver in the world. Loving his own elders, he knows of the aged everywhere; pitying his own children, he knows of the young everywhere."* The *Chāo* notes: *"The *Mèngzǐ·Lí Lóu* chapter states: ‘Yú (the Great Yu) and Jì (the Patriarch of Agriculture) lived in peaceful times, yet passed their doors three times before entering. The Master (Confucius) praised them. Yán Zǐ (Yan Hui) lived in turbulent times, dwelling in a humble lane, eating from a single basket of rice, drinking from a single gourd, while others could not bear his hardships—Yán Zǐ remained unchanged in his joy. The Master praised him.’ Mèngzǐ said: ‘Yú, Jì, and Yán Hui share the same Dao. Yú thought of those drowning in the world as if they were himself drowning. Jì thought of those starving in the world as if they were himself starving. Great Yú governed the world’s floods, and Hou Jì taught the world to sow and cultivate. Hence, their urgency was so great. Yú, Jì, and Yán Zǐ shared the same Dao, and if their positions were exchanged, they would act likewise. Moreover, the *Mèngzǐ·Liáng Huì Wáng* chapter states: ‘Revere my elders as I do my own; extend this reverence to all elders. Love my children as I do my own; extend this love to all children. Then the world may be governed as if it were in the palm of my hand.’ All this is the Dao of observing oneself to understand one’s family, and one’s family to understand the world. How much more so is it the Dao of observing oneself to understand the world! If one can do this, why must he wait to leave his door before knowing the world?"*

*"Seeing the Dao without peering through windows."*

The *Zhuàn* says: *"The sovereign (ruler) aligns himself with the **Èr Yí** (Two Principles: Heaven and Earth) in virtue, and with the sun and moon in radiance. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order."* The *Chāo* notes: *"The *Yì·Xiān·Kàn* (Commentary on the *Kàn* Hexagram of the *Yìjīng*) states: ‘The great person aligns himself with Heaven and Earth in virtue, with the sun and moon in radiance, with the four seasons in their sequence, and with spirits and gods in their blessings and omens. He precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; he follows Heaven, and he conforms to the Heavenly order.’ It says that if one acts before the Heavenly order, the Dao will comply and not oppose. If one acts after the Heavenly order, one must conform to the Dao and not dare to defy it. Now if a ruler can do this, the Dao will be clear without his need to peer through windows or gaze afar. Moreover, I have heard that **Shào Yáo Fú** composed a poem: ‘One thing originates from one self, one self contains one heaven and earth. Knowing all things are complete within me, why set the Three Realms apart? Heaven divides creation from the One, while man weaves schemes from the heart. Heaven and man share no dual purpose—Dao acts without deception, only through man.’ This may be called ‘seeing the Dao without peering through windows.’ The *Zhuàn* further says: ‘Hence, those who understand the sayings of death and life—*the Yì·Shàng Xì* states: ‘He looks upward to observe the celestial patterns, and downward to examine the earthly features, thus knowing the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest.’"*

「Returning to the origin and reflecting upon the end, one thus understands the sayings of death and life. This is what is meant by them.

The *Zhuàn* further cites **Yán Jūn Píng** as saying: ‘Those who extinguish the Three Five [cycles]—this meaning has already been detailed in the *Dàojīng* [Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*], Chapter Three. I shall not repeat it here.’

The further one’s origin, the less one knows. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘The *Records* [of Rituals] say: “To govern the world, one must first govern one’s own state; to govern one’s state, one must first rectify one’s household; to rectify one’s household, one must first cultivate one’s self; to cultivate one’s self, one must first regulate one’s heart; to regulate one’s heart, one must first make sincere one’s intentions; to make sincere one’s intentions, one must first extend one’s knowledge.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Records of Rituals·Great Learning*: “The ancients who sought to manifest their **virtue/power** [明德] throughout the world first governed their own states. Those who sought to govern their states first brought order to their families. Those who sought to bring order to their families first cultivated their selves. Those who sought to cultivate their selves first regulated their hearts. Those who sought to regulate their hearts first made sincere their intentions. Those who sought to make sincere their intentions first extended their knowledge.” Knowledge refers to knowing the ultimate origins and ends of good and evil, fortune and misfortune. Extending knowledge lies in investigating things [格物]. **格** [guiding/rectifying], here means **to bring forth** [来]; **物** [things], here refers to **affairs** [事]. When one’s knowledge of the good is profound, good things come forth; when one’s knowledge of the evil is profound, evil things come forth—meaning that affairs arise in accordance with what people favor. **致** [extending] or **至** [reaching] both refer to this. When things are investigated [格], knowledge then reaches [至]; when knowledge reaches, intentions become sincere; when intentions are sincere, the heart is regulated; when the heart is regulated, the self is cultivated; when the self is cultivated, the household is brought into order; when the household is in order, the state is governed; when the state is governed, the world is at peace. From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation. If the foundation is disordered while the branches are in order, it is not so. If one’s priorities are reversed—what is valued becomes slighted and what is slighted becomes valued—this has never occurred. This is called knowing the foundation; this is called knowing the ultimate.

**壹** [One], here means to **focus solely** [专行] on the matter.

The *Commentary* [疏] explains that “taking cultivating the self as the foundation” means that from the highest Son of Heaven to the lowest commoner, all must take cultivating the self as their foundation, and governing the state as their secondary concern. **否** [not], here means **no**.

Now, **Bìxū** [Spur of the Void] adopts this saying to illustrate that the further one’s origin, the less one knows. But if one turns it inward to reflect upon one’s own self and heart, that is sufficient.

Thus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes. The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Confucius said: “Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it.”’ The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘This is the text from the *Lu Speech·Tai Bo*: “The Master said: Great indeed is the rule of Yao as a sovereign! Majestic and awe-inspiring, only Heaven is great, only Yao follows it. His governance was vast and harmonious, so much so that the people could not name it; yet majestic was his success, and brilliant his accomplishments.”’ **焕** [radiant], here means **illuminated** [明]. His establishment of laws and institutions was also clearly marked.

It further says: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’ This is also from the *Lu Speech·Wei Ling Gong*: “The Master said: ‘The one who governs through non-action—was it not Shun?’”

In truth, the Sages of antiquity who understood the Dao did not need to leave their homes or travel far to know the boundless affairs of the world. They did not need to peer through windows or gaze upward to see the natural patterns of the heavens. Why exert their intentions or contrive actions? Those who could accomplish the non-action of Heaven and Earth, naturally transforming the world, all knew it by reflecting upon their own selves. Hence, it is said: ‘Thus, the Sage does not act yet knows, does not see yet names, does not do yet accomplishes’—this is why.

**For learning, the goal is daily improvement (目益章); for the Dao, the goal is daily reduction (日损).** The *Zhuàn* states: ‘Knowing the child while guarding the mother, returning to the origin and rooting in the foundation.’

The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘“Knowing the child while guarding the mother” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·The World Has Its Beginning*: “The child is known, the mother is guarded.”’ Its meaning has already been clarified in the present chapter.

It further says: ‘“Returning to the origin” is the text from the *Zhuangzi·Nurturing Life*: “Nurture your life in accordance with the common ways, and through the common ways seek to return to your origin. Diminish your desires in accordance with the common ways, and through contemplation seek to reach your clarity.”’ This refers to the enlightened common people [蔽蒙之民].

It further says: ‘“Rooting in the foundation” is the text from the *Classic of Changes·Extending the Ultimate*: “The root is firm, the foundation is complete.”’ Its meaning is detailed in the present chapter.

Now, if one seeks to return to the origin and root in the foundation, one must first abandon **artificial knowledge** [智], grasp the essential **Dao/Way** [原], and hold fast to the **foundation** [要执本]. “Daily reduction” [日损] means diminishing contrived actions [为], gradually entering into the **mystery/emptiness** [虚妙] of the Dao.

The world is commonly taken through **non-action** [无事], but when there are contrived actions [有事], it is not sufficient to take the world.

The *Zhuàn* states: ‘If one governs through contrived actions, the administration becomes burdensome and the people laborious. They stand with heavy steps and glance sideways—then the people will look upon them with fear.’

The *Pinyin* [commentary] notes: ‘Now, if one seeks to take the world, there is no other method besides making the people’s hearts one’s own. It is natural to follow without opposing, to remain still without moving, to be settled without disturbing. Then the people will find their place, and the world will be without contrived actions. Why is this so?

From the *Mencius·Li Lou, Upper Part #2*: “Mencius said: ‘Jie lost the world because he lost his people. He lost his people because he lost their hearts. There is a way to gain the world. Gain its people, and you gain the world. Gain its people by gaining their hearts. Gain their hearts by gathering what they desire and not imposing what they hate. The people’s return is like water flowing downward or beasts fleeing to their dens. Thus, he who digs a well to attract fish is the otter; he who makes a thicket to attract birds is the hawk. Those who attracted the people as fish or birds were Jie and Zhou. If today’s sovereigns have a love for **virtue** [仁], then the feudal lords will all drive [the people] to them. Even if they sing without a king, they cannot be obtained [by force].’”

The hearts of the people all desire **tranquility** [安], so I remain **still** [静] without disturbing. The hearts of the people all desire **wealth** [富], so I give without taking. The hearts of the people all desire **longevity** [寿], so I nourish without exhausting them [困].」

The Way to transform is through **wuwei** [無為], to harmonize through **wu shi** [無事], to guide through **ziran** [自然], and thus there will be none who fail to win the people’s hearts.

If one governs the people with **youwei** [有為], then the people will be disturbed and unable to be still.
If one burdens the people with affairs, then the people will be exhausted and unable to find peace.

It is further said: *"Those who stand with heavy steps"*—
As recorded in *Shiji’s* *Qin Shihuang Benji*, the Grand Historian remarked: *"The Qin customs were rife with taboos and prohibitions. Before loyal words could even leave a man’s mouth, his body was already put to death."* Thus, the scholars of the realm stood with heavy steps, listening intently, and sealed their mouths, speaking no more. Therefore, three successive rulers lost the Dao, loyal ministers dared not train, wise men dared not plot, and the realm fell into chaos. To govern in this way, yet seek to take the world—it cannot be done.

The Classic states: *"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation, hence their hunger. The people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ **youwei**, hence their difficulty in being governed."*

Thus, Bi Xu said: *"If one governs with **youwei** and burdens the people with affairs, governance becomes cumbersome and the people labored—thus it is insufficient to win the hearts of the people of the world."*

*"Heavy steps"* means standing with feet together, signifying their inability to find peace.
