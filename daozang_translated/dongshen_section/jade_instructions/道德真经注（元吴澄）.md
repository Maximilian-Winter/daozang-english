**Laozi**
**Wu Cheng of Linchuan’s Exegesis**

Laozi, of the Li clan, given name Er, styled Dan.
*The Records of the Historian* [in its *Biographies of Recluses and Hermits*] states: "Styled Boyang, a native of Lixiang, Quren Village, Kuxian County in Chu, he was the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou." He cultivated the Dao and Virtue, taking as his aim the self-effacement of namelessness. Dwelling in Zhou for a long time, upon witnessing its decline, he departed. Arriving at the Pass, the Gatekeeper Yin Xi said: "Master, you are about to depart—please write a book for me." Thus, he composed the *Upper* and *Lower* Scrolls, over five thousand words, and then vanished, his end unknown.

Zhuangzi said: "Taking the root as refined, the branches as coarse, regarding accumulation as insufficiency—serene and solitary, dwelling with the numinous and luminous. Founded upon the ever-non-existent, governed by the Supreme Unity. Displaying frailty, humility, and submission as its exterior, yet within, emptiness and non-destruction of all things as its substance. While others seek fortune, he alone bends to preserve himself whole. Rooted in depth, measured by restraint, ever expansive toward things, never diminished by others—truly the ancient sage of boundless truth!"

**Note on Pronunciation:**
*Kǔ* (苦) with a level tone; *hù* (怙) with a departing tone. *Cáng* (藏) with a departing tone; *qù* (去) with a departing tone.

The *Dao* that can be spoken of is not the eternal *Dao*.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

The *Dao* is like a path—what can be traversed is not the eternal *Dao*.
The "name" refers to *virtue*—what can be designated is not the eternal name.

The *Dao* itself is nameless; it is called *Dao* alone.
If one speaks of it as a path that can be traversed, then it is not the eternal *Dao*.
*Virtue*, though named, is but a forced designation.
If one speaks of it as a name that can be designated, then it is not the eternal *virtue*.

The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.
The nameless—this is the *Dao*; Heaven and Earth arise from this *Dao*, hence it is called the origin.
The named—this is *virtue*; ten thousand things arise from this *virtue*, hence it is called the mother.

Ever without desire, one observes its subtlety;
Ever with desire, one observes its peril.
The "ever" refers to the constancy of the eternal *Dao* and eternal *virtue*.
Ever without desire—this is the stillness of the sage’s nature, where the *Dao* manifests in its entirety, and from this one observes the subtlety of *virtue*.
The "subtlety" refers to the utmost excellence, spoken of in terms of the *Dao*.
Ever with desire—this is the sage’s responsiveness to things, where *virtue* acts in its fullest capacity, and from this one observes the peril of the *Dao*.
The "peril" refers to the threshold, as in Mencius’ "the beginning."

These two—*Dao* and *virtue*—are the same.
These two—*Dao* and *virtue*—though distinct in name when manifested, are called the *Mystic*.
The *Mystic*—that which is profound and unfathomable.

*Virtue* emerges from the *Dao* yet differs in name, so it is not called *Dao* but *virtue*.
Though differing in name, *virtue* and *Dao* are both called the *Mystic*—thus they are not truly different.

The *Mystic*, again the *Mystic*—
The gateway through which all subtleties emerge.

All subtleties refer to *virtue*.
The gateway refers to their origin.

*Virtue* and *Dao*, though both called the *Mystic*, are such that the *Dao* is the *Mystic* of *Mystics*—
The source from which all subtleties coalesce.
The subtlety of subtleties is the *Dao*;
The subtlety that unifies is *virtue*—
The subtlety that branches into myriad particulars.

---
**Chapter One**
This chapter expounds the essence of *Dao* and *virtue*.

Zhang Zai said:
From the Great Emptiness comes the name *Heaven*;
From *qi* transformation comes the name *Dao*.
Laozi regards the Great Emptiness as that from which Heaven and Earth arise, calling it the *Dao*;
And *qi* transformation as that from which all things derive their being, calling it *virtue*.
The *Dao* refers to the principle above form, unmingled with *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s "ever non-existent."
*Virtue* refers to the principle within form, where this principle inheres in *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s "Supreme Unity."
Thus, its *Dao* and *virtue* take as their substance the natural void,
And as their function the yielding and unfilled.

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness, then badness arises.
"Beauty" refers to beauty in contrast to other things, speaking of its substance.
"Goodness" refers to excellence in its function.
The names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, arise in relation.
Because ugliness exists, beauty exists;
Because badness exists, goodness exists.
When all know this as beauty, that becomes ugliness;
When all know this as goodness, that becomes badness.
If one were to eliminate both, making none know beauty as beauty or goodness as goodness,
Then there would also be no ugliness, no badness.

Thus, existence and non-existence give rise to each other;
Difficulty and ease complete each other;
Length and shortness define each other;
High and low depend on each other;
Sounds and tones harmonize;
Before and after follow each other.

The existence and non-existence of things,
The difficulty and ease of matters,
The length and shortness of forms,
The high and low of circumstances,
The opening and closing of sounds,
The purity and turbidity of tones,
The sequence of positions—
These are all paired opposites.
Where one exists, the other exists;
Where one does not exist, the other does not exist.
The arising of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, follows this same principle.

"Define each other" refers to two forms standing side by side;
"Depend on each other" refers to one ascending, one descending;
"Harmonize" refers to one initiating, one responding;
"Follow" refers to the sequential connection, like the wind following the earth.

Of these five, four explicitly state their pairs,
But "sounds and tones" are not—
For if one merely says "opening and closing, purity and turbidity,"
People would not recognize this as referring to sounds and tones.
By naming "sounds and tones," their paired opposites—opening/closing, purity/turbidity—are naturally understood.
Thus, only the reality is indicated, not the pair.

Therefore, the sage acts without action,
And teaches without speech.
If one acts, then there are things left undone;
Only in non-action is there nothing left undone.
If one speaks, then there are things left unsaid;
Only in non-speech is there nothing left unsaid.

All things arise without his claiming them,
All things are born without his possessing them—
Heaven and Earth are thus as well.

"Arise" refers to the springtime when things begin to form;
"Claim" refers to speech.
"Born" refers to the summertime when things are fully formed;
"Possess" refers to ownership.
Not claiming, not possessing—
This is the silent teaching of Heaven and Earth.

The Master said of Heaven, *"What speech can there be of it?"*—
All things arise within it, and that is all.

It acts yet does not rely,
It completes yet does not dwell.
*"Acts"* refers to the time when things are forming in autumn—
*"Rely"* refers to relying on one’s ability and acting.
*"Completes"* refers to the time when things are fully formed in winter—
*"Dwell"* refers to taking credit for one’s deeds.
Not relying, not dwelling—
This is the non-action of Heaven and Earth.

Only because it does not dwell,
It does not depart.
Not departing,
This is eternal existence.

Heaven and Earth do not dwell upon the completion of things,
Thus their work endures forever and does not depart.

---
The sage governs by doing without doing,
Thus his governance requires no action;
He teaches without speaking,
Thus his teaching requires no words.
Without doing and without speaking,
Even if there is beauty and goodness, people do not know of it—
Thus its beauty and goodness are alone, exalted and noble, with none to compare.

If there is governance through action,
If there is teaching through speech,
Then people all know whether it is beautiful or evil,
And beauty opposes ugliness, goodness opposes badness—
This is not the alone-exalted, alone-noble beauty and goodness.

All the chapters within *Laozi*’s book
Do not depart from the meaning of this chapter.

Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend;
Do not treasure hard-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;
Do not display what is desirable, so the people’s hearts do not grow乱.
*"Exalt"* means to honor and elevate,
*"Treasure"* means to value highly,
*"Display"* is akin to *"show."*

The worthy among people—
Their names may be exalted above others,
But if exalted, the people will all strive for that name and thus contend.
Hard-to-obtain goods—
Their profits may be treasured above others,
But if treasured, the people will all seek that profit and thus steal.

For names and profits are desirable—
If they are not exalted, not treasured,
This is not showing them as desirable,
Thus the people’s hearts do not contend, do not steal—
This is not乱.

Therefore, the sage’s governance:
Empties their minds,
Fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions,
Strengthens their bones.
These four phrases all refer to the people.

*"Empties their minds"* means to make the people unaware of the value of profit, so they have no thieving hearts.
*"Fills their bellies"* means that though the people may not covet profit, the sage secretly ensures they have enough to eat and are well-fed, never failing to provide for them.
*"Weakens their ambitions"* means to make the people unaware of the exaltation of names, so they have no contentious hearts.
*"Strengthens their bones"* means that though the people may not covet names, the sage secretly encourages them to exert themselves and grow strong, never failing to inspire them toward virtue.

Always make the people have no knowledge, no desires—
That is, make the people have no knowledge of names and profits as desirable, so they have no desire for them.
Make those who know dare not act—
That is, though the people may know of names and profits as desirable, they dare not act in contention or theft.
Yet even if they dare not act, they still retain the heart to do so—
Only they do not dare.

To act in non-action,
Then there is nothing that is not governed.

---
This chapter speaks of the Dao/Way by which the sage governs the world.
Later generations of nourishment cultivators borrowed these words for their own teachings—
Though their teachings may be refined, they are not the original intent of *Laozi*.

The Dao is boundless yet used—
Sometimes it does not fill.
Deep, it seems the ancestral root of all things.
*"Boundless"* originally refers to the emptiness of a washbasin—
Some doubt the words, not daring to be certain.
The Dao’s essence is empty;
Those who use this Dao must also be empty and not filled—
If filled, it is not the Dao.

*"Deep"* means unfathomable.
*"Root"* is like the ancestral root—
The root is the lineage’s foundation;
The Dao is the foundation of all things,
Thus it is called the ancestral root of all things.
*"Seems"* is also a phrase of not daring to be certain.

The Dao blunts its sharpness,
Dissolves its entanglements,
Mutes its radiance,
Blends with the dust.

Profound, it seems as though it may exist.

*"Blunt"* means to crush.
*"Sharp"* means keen.
*"Entanglements"* are knots.
*"Dissolve"* means to unravel knots by dulling their sharpness.

All that is sharp must eventually dull—
Thus, first crush its own sharpness,
To dissolve the other’s entanglements,
Not desiring its sharpness,
Then there will never be a time when it dulls.

*"Mute"* is like leveling.
It carries the meaning of suppression.
*"Blend"* means to equalize and not differ.
A mirror receiving dust loses its brightness—
All that is bright must eventually darken,
Thus, first suppress its own radiance to blend with the other’s dust,
Not desiring its brightness,
Then there will never be a time when it darkens.

That which is sharp must dull,
That which is bright must darken—
Just as that which is full must overflow.
The Dao does not desire fullness,
Thus, the sharp is crushed and its sharpness is not desired,
The bright is muted and its brightness is not desired.

The two *"its sharp"* and *"its bright"* belong to the self,
The two *"its entanglements"* and *"its dust"* belong to others.
Old interpretations reading this as four separate meanings are incorrect—
These four lines speak of the Dao’s use not being full.

*"Profound"* carries the sense of serene stillness.
The Dao’s essence is empty,
Thus its existence here seems as though it may exist,
Yet it is not truly a thing that exists here.
This line speaks of the Dao’s emptiness.

○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.
I do not know whose child it is—
It precedes the Emperor like an image.

I do not know whose child—
This is the question.
Like an image before the Emperor—
This is the answer.

*"Child"* refers to what is born of father and mother.
*"Image"* is Heaven, *"Emperor"* is its sovereign.
Heaven has form, and *"Emperor"* is its ruler.
So, who is the Dao’s child?
Heaven precedes all things,
Yet the Dao precedes Heaven—
Thus Heaven too is born of the Dao,
And there is none before the Dao.

○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.

---

The fourth chapter:
*"Heaven and Earth are without virtue,
Treating all things as straw dogs;
The Sage is without virtue,
Treating the people as straw dogs."*

*"Virtue"* means to hold affection in one’s heart.
A *"straw dog"* is bound grass shaped like a dog,
Used in rain prayers—
Once the prayer is done, it is cast aside,
With no further care.

Heaven and Earth hold no affection for things,
Yet let them grow and complete themselves.
The Sage holds no affection for the people,
Yet lets them act and rest on their own.
Thus, the straw dog is the metaphor.

Indeed, the Sage’s heart is empty,
With nothing to lean upon—
If he held affection for the people,
His heart would not be empty.

○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.

Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like the bellows?

Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing.

The bellows is a smith’s tool,
A vessel to fan flames with breath and fire.
The outer casing, enclosing all around—*tu*.
The inner handle, stirring within—*kuai*.

Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows:
*Tu* mirrors the Great Void, embracing the boundless form,
*Kuai* mirrors Original Qi, weaving the ceaseless flow.
Unyielding means its motion is straight,
Ever producing means its birth knows no end.

Only because it is *tu*’s emptiness and *kuai*’s transformation—
Transformation is ever extending,
Thus *kuai*’s motion and *tu*’s birth—
Birth is ever enriching—
Within Heaven and Earth.

In the human realm, then,
Only when the heart is empty, uncluttered,
And qi flows unobstructed along its paths,
Does qi move with constancy,
And the abundance of life that emerges grow ever greater.

Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to guard the center.

*Shu* means swiftness,
*Qiong* means depletion of qi.
When a person speaks much, their qi is drained,
Exhausting their reserves prematurely.
Better to keep the heart empty, steadfast in its place,
So that external things do not enter,
And the inner spirit does not stray—
Then its emptiness is boundless,
And the qi it generates is boundless.

The *center* is the *tu*’s interior,
Where *kuai* performs its work.

○ *Shu* sounds like *shuò*.

The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Female.

The *Valley* symbolizes emptiness;
Emptiness preserves the spirit within—
Thus, the *Valley Spirit*.
The *Valley* is the center’s dwelling place,
And the spirit that guards it—
Not dying means Original Qi endures without end.

The *Female* symbolizes the moist, weak, yielding nature of Original Qi.
The prefix *Mysterious* is an honorific.
The Mysterious Female—
The mother of all things—
As Zhuangzi called the *Taiyi*,
Some name it the *Soul Treasure, Post-Heaven’s Ancestor*.

The gate of the Mysterious Female—
This is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.

The *gate* is the path of emergence,
The *root* is the path of birth.
The natural emptiness—
The source from which Heaven and Earth arise—
Thus, the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.
The Root of Heaven and Earth—
The beginning of Heaven and Earth—
As Zhuangzi called the *Ever-Nonbeing*,
Some name it the *Primordial Origin, Pre-Heaven’s Ancestor*.

Enduring, as if it exists—
Using it does not exhaust.

*Enduring* means unbroken continuity,
*As if* means *like*—
The spirit’s preservation,
*Exhaust* means labor.

When qi is used with ease, it is nourished and grows daily;
When used with strain, it is depleted and wanes.
The spirit, if preserved within, ensures qi is not consumed.

---
**Chapter Five:**
Heaven endures, Earth persists.

Heaven and Earth endure and persist
Because they do not generate themselves—
Thus they endure and persist.

Heaven and Earth generate all things with their qi,
Yet do not generate their own qi.

Thus the Sage places himself last,
Yet is first;
Sets himself aside,
Yet is preserved.

Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.

*Last* means humility, not seeking precedence,
*First* means elevation, standing above.
*Sets himself aside* means quietude, non-action, not seeking to augment life,
*Preserved* means enduring, long-lasting in the world.
*No selfishness* means placing himself last and setting himself aside,
*Fulfills his selfishness* means being first and preserved.

The Sage does not *actively* fulfill his selfishness,
Yet naturally achieves being first and preserved.
If one assumes others seek to fulfill their selfishness,
Then speaking of it would mean they *can* fulfill it.

---
**Chapter Six:**
The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits all things without striving,
Dwelling where people find repugnant—
Thus it approaches the Dao.

*Highest virtue* means the supreme, ultimate virtue,
The virtue of those who embody the Dao.
Why is it like water?
Water’s virtue lies in its ability to irrigate and cleanse,
Benefiting all things without contention,
Not seeking purity but dwelling in the low and filthy—
Thus it nears the virtue of the Dao.

*Near* means close.

To dwell in good land,
To have a good heart like a deep well,
To associate with good people,
To speak with good faith,
To govern with good order,
To act with good skill,
To move at the right time.

These are the virtues that others deem good—
To dwell in good land is to secure a foundation,
To have a good heart is to be deep and still,
To associate with good people is to be close to the virtuous.
To speak with good faith is to be trustworthy,
To govern well is to value order,
To act with skill is to value competence,
To move at the right time is to act when opportunity arises.

These seven virtues all choose what others favor as good—
This may be called *good*, yet it is not the *highest virtue*.

Only because it does not contend,
Is there no blame.

Only the highest virtue of the Dao—
Not contending, yet content to dwell below,
Like water—
Thus no one blames it.

*Blame* means resentment.
Others dislike dwelling below but seek to rise,
Those who desire to surpass others harbor contention,
And contention brings blame.

---
**Chapter Seven:**
To grasp and fill—
Better to stop in time—

To measure and sharpen—
Yet this cannot be long preserved.

*Hold* means to bear,
*Stop* means to cease.
*Measure* means to pound.

This chapter speaks of the Dao not desiring fullness,
And yet compares it to sharpness,
Saying that one who fills a basin with water cannot do so endlessly—
When full, it easily overflows;
Better to cease before it fills.

Similarly, one who hones a needle’s point
Cannot long preserve its sharpness—
Forced too far, it breaks.
Thus, neither fullness nor sharpness can be long preserved.

○ *Easy* rhymes with *bean* (豉).

Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them long;
Rich and noble yet proud,
They invite their own ruin.

When merit is complete and fame is achieved, withdraw—
This is the Way of Heaven.

Why do some have gold and jade yet cannot guard them?
Because they grow proud in wealth and nobility,
And thus invite their own ruin.

Therefore, when merit is complete and fame is achieved,
To withdraw is to align with Heaven’s Way—
This is the teaching of not overfilling.

*Gold and jade* means wealth.
*Pride* means fullness.
*Invite ruin* means self-inflicted fault,
Not caused by others.
*Ruined* means unable to guard it.
*Merit complete and fame achieved* means nobility.
*Withdraw* means not to overfill.

Heaven’s Way is empty yet never full,
Thus the seasons follow their course,
And what is accomplished departs.

First wealth, then nobility—
Yet the two words *wealth* and *nobility* in the middle sentence
Unify the before and after.
Only nobility contains wealth,
And since nobility must bring wealth,
The two are interdependent.
Thus, pride and fullness destroy wealth—
Which is to say, they destroy nobility as well;
While withdrawal and non-fullness preserve nobility—
Which is also to preserve wealth.

---
**Chapter Eight:**

To bear the *yīng* and embrace the One—
Can one remain undivided?

To focus *qi* and attain softness—
Can one become like an infant?

To purify and gaze into the void—
Can one be without blemish?

*Bear* is like *add*.
The *yīng* is the *camp* (of *yīn*), like the *camp* in *military camp*.
The *hun* (vital soul) is the *guard*, like *guard* in *bodyguard*.
The *yīng* is where soldiers dwell—
When the spirit joins the *yīng* and the *yīng* embraces the *hun*,
Their union never separates,
Like the sun and moon enduring through eternity.
This is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their form.

To focus *qi* within,
Infusing flesh and bone with its warmth,
Achieving extreme softness,
Like an infant in the womb—
This is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their *qi*.

The spirit dwells in the eyes;
When the eyes see, the spirit wanders outward.
Closing the eyes to hide sight,
Darkness becomes the void—
Yet even within the void, there remains perception,
Which is still a blemish.
When perception within the void is also purified,
All illusions vanish,
And only then is there no blemish—
This is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their spirit.

○ *Divided* rhymes with *depart* (离).

To love the people and govern the state—
Can one act without doing?

The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—
Can one be receptive?

Bright and far-reaching—
Can one be without knowing?

To love the people and govern the state means
The ruler uses benevolence and wisdom for the people,
Yet the spirit remains outward and cannot yet unite within.
But though the body labors, it remains naturally serene,
Unwearied—
This is the way of those in the world who nurture their form.

The Heavenly Gate opening and shutting refers to
The breath entering and exiting through the nose—
*Qi* is divided outward and cannot yet be unified within.
Yet though the breath flows, it is smooth and refined,
Not harsh—
This is the way of those in the world who nurture their *qi*.

Bright and far-reaching means
The eyes see light and gaze in all directions—
The eyes engage outward and cannot yet withdraw perception.
Yet though the eyes see, the mind and surroundings are forgotten,
And nothing is discerned—
This is the way of those in the world who nurture their spirit.

To nurture and tend—
To give life yet not possess,
To act yet not rely,
To lead yet not dominate—
This is called *mysterious virtue*.

*Nurture* refers to *qi* before it manifests;
*Nurture* means to give life with constancy.
*Tend* refers to *qi* once it has manifested;
*Tend* means to gather without depletion.

*Nurture* gives life though without intention to do so—
Thus, *not possess*.
*Tend* acts though without intention to rely—
Thus, *not rely*.
Like an official who governs though without intention to rule—
Thus, *not dominate*.
This is why it is called the *mysterious, unfathomable virtue*.

○ *Tend* rhymes with *chastise* (畜).

The **sound** sustains.

To the right, the ninth chapter:
Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
Yet it is their *emptiness* that gives the chariot its use.
Clay is molded into vessels—
Yet it is their *emptiness* that gives them their function.
Doors and windows are carved for the dwelling—
Yet it is their *emptiness* that gives it its purpose.
Thus, *having* is for *advantage*,
While *emptiness* is for *use*.

The spokes are the **rim’s** spokes.
The hub is the **wheel’s** core.
The *emptiness* is the hollow space within.
*Clay* is the blended earth.
*Molded earth* is the sticky, malleable part.
To *make vessels* means to mix water with sticky earth to form pottery.
In general, for dwellings, the east has doors, the west has windows—
Doors for entering and exiting,
Windows for light and ventilation.
The chariot carries burdens and travels far,
The vessel stores things,
The dwelling shelters people—
Thus, having this chariot, this vessel, this dwelling,
All serve the world’s *advantage*.
Hence, it is said: *Having* is for *advantage*.

Yet the chariot, without the hub’s hollow space to turn the axle,
Could not traverse the earth;
The vessel, without its inner hollow space to hold things,
Could not store them;
The dwelling, without doors and windows’ hollow spaces for entry and light,
Could not shelter people.
The chariot’s use lies in its turning axle,
The vessel’s use lies in its capacity,
The dwelling’s use lies in its entry and light—
All depend on their *emptiness*.
Hence, it is said: *Emptiness* is for *use*.

The human body’s solid belly holds *qi* to sustain life—
This is called *advantage*.
The empty heart, free of attachments, nurtures *qi*—
This is called *use*.
Thus, these three things are used as analogies.

○ *And* (和) – *Hu-wò* rhyme.
To the right, the tenth chapter.

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deafen the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate,
Galloping hunts and wild chases drive the mind to madness,
Rare and coveted goods disrupt one’s conduct.
All external desires are harms to the body.

○ *Huàng-xià-mèng* rhyme.

Thus, the Sage cultivates the belly, not the eyes,
And so discards the former to embrace the latter.
The Sage nourishes *qi* only by filling the belly,
Not indulging the eyes for fleeting pleasures.

Therefore, he utterly rejects all external falsehoods
And takes only the singular truth within.
Above, the five afflictions—blindness, deafness, dulled palate, madness, and disrupted conduct—
Below, only the eyes are mentioned,
For one example suffices to encompass the rest.

Dong Si-Jing says:
The previous chapter spoke of the use of emptiness within,
This warns against being filled by external evils.
Yet the eyes must see, the ears must hear,
The mouth must taste, the body must labor,
The mind must respond—
Still, one cannot be absolutely still.
Only when movement never departs from stillness
Does even motion not cling to things,
And thus one remains serene and desireless.

Chasing after dust and clinging to phenomena all lose their true nature,
And the root lies in the eyes—
Hence, it is spoken of from beginning to end.
The Master’s four "do nots" first say, "Do not look."
Among the six senses and six dusts, the eye and color stand first.

○ *Chéng-rù-xù-lì-mèng* rhyme.

To the right, the eleventh chapter.

Honor and disgrace are like a startling shock,
Wealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body.

"Honor" is like love—
The prestige of name and rank,
Which people regard as glory,
Yet upon reflection, is disgrace.
Thus, the enlightened do not love it,
While those who love it are startled by it,
Meaning they cannot forget it and let it disturb the mind.

"Wealth" is like burden—
The riches of goods and money,
Which people regard as great benefit,
Yet upon reflection, is great exhaustion.
Thus, the enlightened do not prize it,
While those who prize it treat it as a body burden,
Meaning they cannot set it aside and let it weigh upon themselves.

What is meant by "honor and disgrace like a startling shock"?
Disgrace is lowly.
To obtain it is like a shock,
To lose it is like a shock.
Those called "disgrace" are so because they are base and unworthy of exaltation.
Some covet what they have not yet gained,
And when they finally obtain it, they are startled.
They cling to what they have already gained,
And when they lose it, they are startled.
Thus, they are startled by honor as if it were disgrace,
Hence, it is said: *Honor and disgrace are like a startling shock.*

What is meant by *"Wealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body"*?
My great calamity arises because I have a body.
When I have no body, what great calamity do I have?
Humans in this life fret over countless worries,
Trembling and preserving, only freed at death.
The body is a great calamity, beyond remedy.
Wealth and goods are external calamities—
Abandoned and not possessed, how can they be a burden?
Some do not know the lightness of external things,
Treating them as heavy as their own body,
Fearful of losing what they possess,
Thus, they prize this great calamity as if it were their own body,
Hence, it is said: *Wealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body.*

○ *Sàng-xī-làng* rhyme.

Therefore, if one values the body as the world,
One can entrust the world to it;
If one loves the body as the world’s chaos,
One can commit the world to it.

The Son of Heaven’s exaltation,
The riches of the four seas,
All stem from treating the body as the world.
The enlightened cherish and honor this body,
Not willing to use it lightly for the world,
Rather, they would prefer to have no world
Than to lightly risk their body.
Only thus can they entrust the world to it.

"Entrust" is like entrusting a hundred-li command,
"Commit" is like committing a six-foot orphan.
Shun and Yu held the world without claiming it,
Thus they could receive the succession of Tang and Yu.

Those who prize honor as disgrace and take it as glory,
Or prize wealth as great calamity and take it as great benefit,
Are vulgar indeed—
How could one entrust the world to them?

To value the body as the world,
To enrich the body as the world—
The Master’s intent is excellent,
Yet Yang Zhu’s "for myself" doctrine originates here.

○ *Wéi-yún-wěi* rhyme.

The sound *fū*...

The sound *yù*.

**Chapter Twelve:**
That which is seen but not seen is called *yí* (level),
That which is heard but not heard is called *xī* (rare),
That which is grasped but not obtained is called *wēi* (subtle).
These three cannot be interrogated or forced,
Thus they merge into one.

This chapter speaks of the manifestation of virtue’s traces:
The eye sees easily what is level—*yí* means even and boundless,
So it is not seen.
The ear hears easily what is dense—*xī* means sparse and distant,
So it is not heard.
The hand grasps easily what is vast—*wēi* means faint and indistinct,
So it is not obtained.
*Yí*, *xī*, and *wēi*—though one might seek to exhaust their meaning,
They cannot be, thus they merge indistinctly into one.
Called *yí*, called *xī*, called *wēi*, called *one*—
All point to the constant virtue.

Above, it does not dazzle;
Below, it does not obscure.
*Shéngshéng*—ineffable, returning to nothingness.
Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower reaches are not dim.

*Shéngshéng*—continuously flowing without end,
Returning to the formless.
This is called the form of no-form,
The image of no-image—*hūhuǎng*.
It is also called virtue.
Above and below, as the *Yijing* speaks of "form above form, form below form."

*Shéngshéng*—unbroken, flowing past and continuing.
*Fù*—returning, restoring.
"Nothingness" refers to the Dao.
Above virtue is the Dao—Dao is nameless, hence not dazzling.
Below virtue is things—things have form, hence not dim.
Virtue lies between existence and nonexistence,
Though seemingly named, it cannot be named;
Returning to its origin, it merges into the Dao of nothingness—
As Zhuangzi says: "When virtue reaches its peak, it returns to its beginning."

The Dao is nothingness, hence without form or image;
Virtue has a name, hence can be formed and imaged.
Yet its form and image are not like those of things,
Thus: "form of no-form, image of no-image."
Seeming both present and absent—*hūhuǎng*.
Approach it, and you see no head;
Follow it, and you see no tail.

Hold fast to the ancient Dao
To govern the present.
Knowing the ancient beginning—
This is called the "memoir of the Dao."

Only because it is *hūhuǎng* and nameless,
Approaching from before, following from behind—
Yet it is never seen.
The "ancient" refers to what precedes,
The "present" to what follows.
"Things" are what the Dao scatters as virtue,
Its flow pervading all things—
Thus: "Hold fast to the ancient Dao
To govern the present."
The "ancient beginning" is the Dao—
That which preceded heaven and earth.
The "memoir of the Dao" is virtue—
The Dao dispersing as virtue,
Like threads of silk, orderly yet unbroken.
To know this Dao is to know this virtue—
The record of the Dao.

**Chapter Thirteen:**
The ancient skilled in being a *shì* (noble) were
Subtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—
Deep beyond recognition.
Only because they were beyond recognition
Did they forcefully assume outward appearances.

A *shì* is one with the Dao, universally responsive—*tōng*.
Mysterious in all things, penetrating without limit,
Subtle yet not apparent, their penetration profound—
Like water’s depth, unfathomable.
Their depths being unfathomable,
They forcefully modeled outward appearances to show others.
The seven descriptions below are these:

*Yù*—like a winter crossing of a river,
*Yóu*—like fearing four neighbors,
*Yǎn*—like a guest’s solemnity,
*Huàn*—like ice about to thaw,
*Dūn*—like uncarved wood,
*Kuàng*—like a valley,
*Hún*—like muddy water.

*Yù*—like the *yù* beast.
*Yóu*—like a puppy.
The *yù* foresees ahead, moving hesitantly;
The puppy follows then turns back,
Thus hesitant and retreating—*yóu*.
Crossing a river in winter, fearing neighbors—
Thus hesitant and retreating.
One with the Dao does not dare lead the world,
Their bearing such as this.

*Solemn*—dignified and reserved,
Like a guest—following without welcoming.
*Huàn*—dissolving,
Like ice about to release—melting yet not stagnant.
*Dūn*—sincere and thick,
Like uncarved wood—unfinished yet potential.
*Kuàng*—vast and open,
Like a valley—empty yet responsive.
*Hún*—muddy and turbid,
Like turbid water—beauty and flaw merge indistinctly.

○ *Hún* sounds like *hú-gùn*.
*Huàn* sounds like *xiè*.

Who can make turbid still and gradually clear?
Who can make settled move and gradually vitalize?
Following the turbid’s question—who can make it turbid?
Turbid is the time of motion; motion followed by stillness
Gradually clears.
Again, following stillness’s question—who can make it settled?
Settled is the time of stillness; stillness followed by motion
Gradually vitalizes.
*Settled* means steadfast stillness,
*Vitalize* means active motion—
For only the turbid brings clarity,
Only the settled brings motion.
Thus, the vast are not full yet full,
The sincere are not tools yet tools,
The dissolving are not rigid yet rigid,
The solemn are not lords yet lords,
The hesitant are not leaders yet leaders—
This can be understood.

The Master’s intent is roughly this;
Later chapters unfold it fully:
Crooked becomes straight,
Hollow becomes full,
Defective becomes new—
This is the intent.

Those who preserve this Dao
Do not desire fullness.
Only because they do not desire fullness
Can they be defective without becoming new.
*New* means complete.
All things, when defective, are incomplete;
When new, they are complete.
Defective and incomplete are not full,
New and complete are full.
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,
Thus they remain defective without becoming new.

The seven appearances within this chapter—
All are defective yet not new.

---

**Chapter Fourteen:**
Push emptiness to its utmost,
Hold steadfast to stillness with sincerity.
*Push*—to reach the extreme of *emptiness*,
*Hold*—to guard stillness with depth.

The void is the absence of substance—
external things do not enter within.
*Extreme* means exhausting its essence.
*Guard* means fortifying the inner while resisting the outer,
like the defense of a walled city.
*Stillness* means immobility—
the inner mind does not stray outward.
*Sincerity* means unflagging effort.

When all things stir in motion,
I observe their return.
*Motion* is change—
the growth of plants, the awareness of animals,
all are motion.
*Return* means reversal—
things arise from stillness into motion,
thus returning to their original stillness is *return*.

Plants store their vital *qi* below,
animals settle their minds within.
All things, teeming and thriving,
each return to their root.

Returning to the root is stillness;
stillness is *returning to the Way of Life*.
Teeming describes their growth and motion.

Take any plant:
in spring and summer, vital *qi* rises from the root,
reaching the branches and leaves—this is motion.
In autumn and winter, vital *qi* descends back,
storing itself in the root—this is stillness.

The *qi* of Heaven that generates all things is called *Life*.
Returning to its original source is *returning to the Way of Life*.
*Returning to the Way of Life* is constancy;
knowing constancy is clarity.

To not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.
Knowing constancy brings tolerance;
tolerance brings impartiality;
impartiality brings sovereignty;
sovereignty aligns with Heaven;
Heaven aligns with the Dao;
the Dao endures eternally—
through life’s end, no peril.

Constancy is enduring without change—
those who grasp this are called *clear*.
The ignorant, unaware, cannot guard stillness
but act recklessly, harming their *Life*—
thus, disaster.

*Tolerance* refers to outward form manifesting externally;
those inwardly nourished bear a different appearance.
*The impartial* are rulers of a realm,
speaking of preserving all they possess.
*The sovereign* are rulers of the world,
speaking of encompassing all of Heaven and Earth.
*Heaven* means unity with Heaven—
unity with Heaven means the Dao resides within.
The Dao within means enduring as the Dao does.
*End* means completion;
*peril* means endangering life through depletion.
The character *peril* (殆) bears the radical of death (歹),
often signifying fatality—
danger nearing death.
Death is the exhaustion of *qi* and its end;
thus, *no peril through life’s end* means preserving vitality to completion.

The Great Dao:
Unknown in its presence,

---

Next, they are cherished and praised;
next, they are feared and reviled.
When *virtue/power* is insufficient, there arises distrust.

The *Great Dao* refers to the highest stage—
in the age of the Great Dao, rulers and people forget each other in *wuwei*,
and the people do not know their sovereign exists.

The next stage is the *transformative ruler*,
where the people hold them in affection like parents;
as *ren* and *yi* grow more pronounced,
they are not only cherished but also praised.

The next stage is the *wise ruler*,
where the people revere them like deities;
as wisdom becomes exhausted,
they are not only feared but also reviled.

*Virtue/power* is the substance of the Great Dao.
Once the substance of the Great Dao becomes insufficient,
it cannot match the ancient times,
and so rulers govern the people with less than their full *virtue/power*,
drifting toward ornamentation—
thus, the first decline is the use of *ren* and *yi*,
the second decline is the use of wisdom.

○ *Great sound* is tranquil.
*Yu*! How precious is speech.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the common people say, *"This is how things naturally are."*
This describes the workings of the *Great Dao* being unknown.

*Yu*! As seen in the previous chapter.
*Guì* means precious and honored.
*Rán*—thus.
To treasure speech, not speaking lightly,
like a dog hesitating and retreating.
The Sage does not speak of *wuwei*,
so the people silently receive its blessings,
each living in peace;
when deeds are done and affairs completed,
the people say, *"This is how things have always been,"*
unaware of the sovereign’s grace.

When the Great Dao is abandoned, *ren* and *yi* arise;
when wisdom emerges, great deceit appears.
The earlier stage of the unknown sovereign is the Great Dao.
Cherishing and praising is *ren* and *yi*.
Fear and reviling is wisdom.
From the Great Dao’s first decline to the second,
there are already three stages,
and wisdom transforming into great deceit makes four stages in total.
Yet, when the Great Dao is abandoned and *ren* and *yi* arise,
its decline is still gradual,
but when wisdom appears, great deceit follows swiftly—
its change is swift indeed.

The division of these four stages
resembles roughly the ranks of Emperor, King, Lord, Sage, and Talent
as classified by Master Shao.

When the six bonds of kinship are discordant, there are filial children;
when the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.

This speaks of the matter of *ren* and *yi* arising when the Great Dao is abandoned, yet its meaning differs subtly from the passage above—merely an extension of the argument.

The six bonds of kinship: father and son, brothers, husband and wife.
When superiors and inferiors, elders and juniors each follow their proper Way without discord, then filial children are merely fulfilling their natural duty—unknown as *孝 (xiao)*.
Only when the blind historian fails to honor his father, and the arrogant and haughty gather in rebellion, does one recognize the Great Yu’s filial son.

The state refers to the sovereign; the family refers to the minister.
When sovereign and minister, superiors and inferiors each follow their proper Way without chaos, then loyal ministers are merely fulfilling their natural duty—unknown as *忠 (zhong)*.
Only when the tyrant Zhou of Shang fails as a sovereign, and wicked cliques assemble, does one recognize the loyal ministers of the Three Dynasties.

To abandon *ren* and discard *yi*, the people return to filial piety and parental kindness.
To abandon wisdom and discard intelligence, the people’s benefits increase a hundredfold.
To abandon cleverness and discard profit, thieves and robbers vanish.

*Abandon* means to abandon without action.
*Discard* means to discard without use.
*Saintly wisdom* is intelligence.
*Clever profit* is great deceit.
To lead the people with cleverness, to entice them with profit, to govern them through the arts of commerce and industry—like Guan Zhong governing Qi or Shang Yang governing Qin—this is what was spoken of above regarding the decline of the age into trivial pursuits.

This passage speaks of restoring governance to demonstrate the gradual return to the roots.
To abandon the Emperor’s *ren* and *yi* and return to the sovereign’s Great Dao, the people revert to their origins: children are filial to their fathers, fathers are kind to their children, as in the pure antiquity.
To abandon the King’s wisdom and return to the Emperor’s *ren* and *yi*, the people’s benefits increase a hundredfold compared to the King’s time.
To abandon the Hegemon’s clever profit and return to the King’s wisdom, though not yet reaching the Emperor’s time, their thoughts become profound and far-reaching, their governance and teachings refined, and thieves and robbers vanish.

These three stages are insufficient in *文 (wen)*, so they must have something attached.
To see the unadorned and embrace the uncarved—few private concerns, few desires.
These three refer to *ren*, *yi*, wisdom, and clever profit.
*Attached* is akin to Zhuangzi’s *属 (shu)*—to adhere to the nature of *ren* and *yi*.

The sovereign’s Great Dao is rich in substance, lacking only in *文 (wen)*, gradually descending from the sovereign to attach to *ren* and *yi*.
The Emperor, finding the sovereign’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from the Great Dao and attaches to *ren* and *yi*.
The King, finding the Emperor’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from *ren* and *yi* and attaches to wisdom.
The Hegemon, finding the King’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from wisdom and attaches to clever profit.

Each of these three governances must have something attached because of their insufficiency in *文*, yet they do not know that the people of the Great Dao, outwardly appearing simple, inwardly guarding their purity.
*素 (su)* is uncolored silk; *朴 (pu)* is uncarved wood.
Substance alone—what need for *文*?
Because they are pure and unadorned, the people, though having bodies, seem without bodies; their private concerns are few.
The people, though having minds, seem without minds; their desires are scarce.

**Chapter Sixteen: Absolute Learning Brings No Worry**
To study daily is to increase, yet to do so in every matter—if one cannot know all, it becomes a source of worry.
Only by abandoning it and not doing so is there no worry.

How far apart are *唯 (wei)* and *阿 (e)*?
How different are *善 (shan)* and *恶 (e)*?

Below, it speaks of the worries that come with study.
*唯* and *阿* are both responses—*唯* is correct and upright, *阿* is crooked and flattering.
*几何* means they are not far apart at first.
*何若* asks how far they are in the end.
For those who study responses, *唯* and *阿* are initially not far apart, but *唯* becomes good while *阿* becomes evil—their ultimate difference is vast. Thus, those who study *唯* fear lest they drift into *阿*—this is one of the things that causes worry.

What people fear, they must fear.
Its vastness knows no end.
*荒 (huang)* means broad; *央 (yang)* means exhausted.
To fear *阿* as evil is to dare not flatter, yet this is but one matter.
All that people fear and dare not do must be feared—these matters are numerous and cannot be easily exhausted. This is why scholars have so many worries.

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
like ascending the Spring Terrace.
I alone remain tranquil, as yet unmanifest,
like an infant before it smiles.

The bustling and harmonious—this is the appearance of joy.
*Dapu*—this is tranquility.
*Zhao*—like the faintest cracks in a tortoise shell.

The multitude of scholars pursue external pleasures to delight themselves,
like feasting on the grandest sacrifice, where the flavors are most exquisite,
like ascending the Spring Terrace, where the sights are most complete.
But I remain tranquil and still,
my passions yet unaroused,
no trace of desire visible—
like an infant before it knows how to smile,
unaware of the world’s joys.

*Chéngchéng*—ah, as if without a place to rest.
*Chéngchéng*—this means to dwell in things.
*Ru wú suǒ guī*—this means to not cling to things.

The multitude all have abundance,
while I alone seem bereft.
*Yí*—this means lost.
The multitude rejoices in what they possess,
but I, with nothing gained, feel empty as if something were missing.

Ah, the heart of a foolish man—*dùndun*—
like the original *Hun Dun*, indistinct and undifferentiated,
a murky ignorance that discerns nothing.
(Read as level tone; also as in Zhuangzi’s *yú fú*—*fú* meaning ignorance.)

The common folk are bright and clear,
while I alone am dim and confused.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
while I alone am dull and obtuse.
The common folk take knowledge for wisdom,
but I alone am ignorant and foolish.

Drifting—like the sea,
wild—like wind with no end.
Like floating upon the ocean,
driven by currents without knowing my course;
like the howling gales,
rising without knowing where they cease.

The multitude all have purpose,
while I alone seem stubborn and vulgar.
The multitude all have purpose—
they know their direction and their end.
*Wán*—this is like a face numb as if paralyzed,
unaware of pain or pleasure.
*Bǐ*—this is the vulgar man.
I alone am dull and ignorant,
like the simple folk of distant, remote lands.
For those who dwell in crowded cities are learned,
while those in far-off, desolate places are ignorant.

I alone differ from others,
and cherish the *Mother*.

This sentence summarizes the eight preceding stanzas.
From *"What people fear"* to *"I alone seem bereft"*—
four stanzas speak of how others strive for many talents,
while I possess none.
From *"The heart of a foolish man"* to *"I alone seem stubborn"*—
four stanzas speak of how others seek knowledge,
while I know nothing.
This is why I differ from others,
and what I cherish is the profound *virtue* of the Dao.
This *profound virtue*—
all things draw nourishment from it, the *Mother* of all things,
thus it is called *feeding the Mother*.
The phrase *"feeding the Mother"* appears in the *Rites of Zhou* [□ *Inner Chapter*],
referring to a wet nurse.
Master Sima says: *"Nourishing the Original Unity."*

(Note: *Shí* sounds like *sì* [successor].)
End of the seventeenth chapter.

**Laozi’s Classic of the Way and Its Virtue: Commentary by Wu Cheng of Lingchuan**

**Volume One Complete**
#1 *Guarding it—guilt*: "Guilt" likely a redundant character.
#2 *Formless form*: Original text omits *"the form"*—supplemented from the Yueya edition.

**Volume Two**
**Wu Cheng’s Commentary on the Lower Scripture of the Dao**

*"The manifestation of supreme virtue follows the Way alone."*

*"Supreme virtue"* means abundant virtue. *"Manifestation"* refers to what exists and is visible. *"Follows"* means "arises from."

All things originate from virtue. Whatever is visible in form and *qi* is the manifestation of virtue. Yet the reason virtue takes this form is that it arises from the Dao.

The Dao itself is but vague and indistinct. Virtue emerges from the Dao, yet the Dao itself is nothing. Virtue is what the Dao produces—seemingly both present and absent, unseen—thus it is called vague and indistinct.

*"Vague and indistinct, yet within it is essence;
Indistinct and vague, yet within it are forms."*

These lines refer to virtue. *"Essence"* means the tangible forms that arise after things take shape. *"Forms"* refers to the *qi* that precedes their generation. Though virtue is vague and indistinct—neither fully seen nor unseen—what is visible in form becomes essence, and what is visible in *qi* becomes pattern, both of which belong to virtue.

Ancient scholars spoke of the boundless void where all things already exist—this is it.

*"Deep and dark, yet within it is purity."*

Though vague and indistinct seem almost visible, they are still somewhat discernible. But deep and dark is utter obscurity—this is the Dao’s nothingness. These lines refer to the Dao; *"purity"* means virtue.

What has essence and form is the coarse manifestation of virtue. Virtue itself, the source of essence and form, is its refined core. Zhuangzi said: *"Take virtue as the root, the root as the essence."*

The earlier passage states that essence and form arise from virtue; this passage says virtue arises from the Dao. Its essence is most true, within it lies authenticity.

*"Its character is twofold—again referring to virtue. True* means the Dao. *Authentic* means real, synonymous with *true*. Essence and form are coarse, while virtue is refined—this refined aspect is the most true Dao within. Virtue contains the utterly real Dao.

The earlier passage says the Dao contains virtue; this says virtue contains the Dao—indeed, the Dao is virtue, virtue is the Dao. The first chapter declares: these two are one.

*"From ancient times to today, its name does not fade,
To observe all things in their beauty."*

*"Does not fade"* means it endures. *"Observe"* is akin to *"pervade."* *"Beauty"* means all things. Though all things’ beauty may change and perish, supreme virtue arising from the Dao remains unchanging from ancient times to today. Thus it is called *"does not fade,"* for it is constant amidst the impermanent beauty of all things.

*"How do I know all things are thus?"*
*By this.*

Thus it is. How then do I know that all things’ transformations and perishings are impermanent in this way? By this supreme virtue’s constancy, I know it.

**Chapter Eighteen:**
*"Bent, yet whole; crooked, yet straight; hollow, yet full; worn, yet renewed; few, yet gain; many, yet confused."*

Bent (*qū*) is one principle. The *Yijing*, *Li Ji*, *Zhongyong*, and *Zhuangzi* all use *qū* to mean "incomplete" or "asymmetrical"—that which is not whole. Yet if one focuses single-mindedly on what is incomplete, refining one’s essence therein, extending laterally to the other, mastering one principle to reverse three, penetrating one to exhaust all ten thousand—over time, one will surely attain wholeness.

If from the outset one seeks wholeness, ambition swells and the heart labors, divided and undedicated, never achieving wholeness.

Crooked (*wǎng*) is not straight. The inchworm bends and becomes crooked, yet thereby it stretches and becomes straight. Hollow (*wā*) is not full. A ditch or pit sinks and becomes hollow, yet thereby it receives water and becomes full. Worn (*bì*) is not new. Autumn and winter wither and become worn, yet thereby they meet spring and renew. Few (*shǎo*) is not many. Fewness leads to abundance—one sentence split into two: fewness is easier to possess, thus one accumulates and becomes many. Coveting many brings confusion, and in one thing, nothing is gained—how could one then become many?

Not desiring straightness, not desiring fullness, not desiring renewal, not desiring abundance—yet beginning with *"bent, yet whole"*, these four are all extensions of *"not seeking wholeness."*

Thus the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.

This sentence is the chapter’s central thesis, unifying the meaning above and below. *One* is the virtue of emptiness and voidness. *Model* (*shì*) is illustrated by a cart: high, one leans on the crossbar; low, one leans on the model. The Sage embraces this virtue of emptiness and voidness, moist and weak yet humble, as the model for all under Heaven—like the five principles above, all are the virtue of emptiness, self-placing in lowliness.

*Jiào* (较) is pronounced *jiǎo* (角).

Not self-displaying, hence enlightened;
Not self-praising, hence renowned;
Not self-boasting, hence accomplished;
Not self-glorifying, hence enduring.

Only by not contending does one under Heaven find none who can contend with them.

Self-display is like self-flaunting; *enlightened* refers to the clarity of wisdom—one who does not self-display shines through obscurity. Self-praise is like self-exalting; *renowned* refers to the brilliance of name—one who does not self-praise grows ever more luminous. To boast of one’s deeds is *boasting*; *accomplished* refers to completed achievements. To arrogate one’s superiority is *glorifying*; *superiority* refers to abilities surpassing others. If one does not self-display, self-praise, boast, or glorify—yet concludes with *"Only by not contending"*—these four are all the remnants of *"not contending."*

The ancients’ *"bent, yet whole"*—was this mere empty speech? Truly whole, and thus returned to it.

The three characters *"bent, yet whole"* were an ancient saying, which Laozi cited as this chapter’s opening. Within the chapter, *"embracing One"* is the guiding thread; *"bent, yet whole"* and the five following, *"only by not contending"* and the five above—ten matters in total—all are what *"bent, yet whole"* can encompass. Hence it is restated at the chapter’s end: *"The ancients’ ‘bent, yet whole’—was this not sincere, a saying without substance? Rather, it is the genuine attainment of wholeness, and thus the effect of wholeness is returned to it."*

**Chapter Nineteen:**
*"Rare speech is natural."*

Listening yet not hearing is *rare* (*xī*); rare speech is no speech. Those who attain the Dao forget speech, following only their natural state.

A gusting wind does not last till morning; a sudden rain does not last till evening. Who does this? Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, yet how much less so for humans?

*Gusting* (*piāo*) is wild and swift; *sudden* (*zòu*) is abrupt and violent. From dawn till mealtime is *"till morning"* (*zhōng zhāo*); from dawn till dusk is *"till evening"* (*zhōng rì*). Not following one’s natural state and yet speaking lightly and impulsively—like Heaven and Earth’s gusting winds and sudden rains—all are contrary to nature’s constancy, becoming monstrous anomalies. Heaven and Earth, contrary to nature’s constancy, cannot endure long as monstrous anomalies, not lasting till morning or evening—how much less so for humans, not following nature?

Thus those who follow the Dao:
Those who align with the Dao are in accord with the Dao;
Those who align with virtue are in accord with virtue;
Those who align with error are in accord with error.

Trust is insufficient here; distrust is insufficient here.

Those of virtue and Dao regard me as one, verified and harmonized—what separation is there? Those of error regard me as one, yet perhaps through their singular truth they awaken to my universal truth—thus all three kinds of people gain through my observation.

Laozi said: *"Not speaking is harmony; harmony and speech are not harmonious; speech and harmony are not harmonious—thus there is no speech."* Also, this is Laozi’s meaning of rare speech, naturalness, and mysterious unity.

Those who align with the Dao, the Dao also gains from them;
Those who align with virtue, virtue also gains from them;
Those who align with error, error also gains from them.

The Way is only attainable by those of Dao.

If the substance of Dao is insufficient within oneself, then in relying upon others, one must inevitably depart from the true substance of Dao, and thus forcefully impose distinctions of right and wrong. How could such a one achieve mysterious unity?

Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand;
Those who stride cannot walk.
Those who see themselves are blind;
Those who insist on being right are not manifest;
Those who boast of their own merits achieve no true merit;
Those who pride themselves in their virtues do not endure.

In the Way, these are called surplus food and superfluous limbs.
Things may detest them, hence those of Dao do not dwell upon them.

Again, using human walking as an analogy for prior matters:
Standing and walking arise naturally, yet some, beyond nature, seek to enhance their stature—
raising their heels to stand taller,
spreading their legs to stride wider—
temporarily so, yet unable to persist.
Ultimately, they cannot stand, cannot walk, and thus are ruined.

So too, those who see themselves will never truly see,
those who insist on being right will never truly shine,
those who boast of their merits will never truly achieve,
those who pride themselves in their virtues will never truly endure—
such is their fate.

What remains uneaten is called surplus;
what grows as an appendage is called superfluous.
This applies to both humans and spirits.

Those who see themselves, insist on being right, boast of their merits, or pride themselves in their virtues—
if measured against the natural Way,
are like surplus food that should not be eaten,
or superfluous limbs that should not be borne.
Exceeding the natural measure, they are useless,
and though they exist in both hidden and manifest realms,
those of Dao refuse to dwell upon them.

Some say *xíng* (行) is read as *xíng* (形), as ancient characters were interchangeable.
The Sima family says: "Discarding surplus food only makes others detest you;
superfluous limbs only make you appear ugly."
The Su family says: "Excess in eating and drinking brings illness;
superfluous limbs bring burden."

**Chapter Twenty**

The essence of this chapter lies in the two characters *natural*.

Silent speech and mysterious unity—this is naturalness.

The drifting of wind, the suddenness of rain,
standing on tiptoe, striding wide,
surplus food, superfluous limbs—
these are not natural.

There exists a thing, indistinctly formed,
born before Heaven and Earth.

The previous chapter spoke of *Dao as a thing*—here, *thing* refers to *virtue*.
This chapter speaks of *a thing indistinctly formed*—here, *thing* refers to *Dao*.

*Mixed and complete*—unpartitioned wholeness.
Born before Heaven and Earth—
the beginning of Heaven and Earth, as in the first chapter,
and the time before the Sovereign Pattern, as in the fourth chapter.

Silent and boundless,
it stands alone yet never changes,
moves in cycles yet never falters—
thus it may be called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.

*Silent*—utter stillness.
*Boundless*—vast emptiness.
It speaks of having no sound, no form.

Standing beyond all things, unchanging in opposition,
it moves through all things, never exhausted—
thus it is called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.

*Mother* refers to *virtue*, yet virtue is what Dao accomplishes,
hence it is called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.

I know not its name—
I call it *Dao*.
Forced to name it, I call it *Great*.

This thing cannot be named,
yet as the source from which Heaven, Earth, and all things arise,
I borrow the character *Dao* (道) to represent it.
*Dao* is not its true name, but a substitute.

The substitute is insufficient, yet compelled, I name it *Great*.
Nothing is greater than Heaven, yet Heaven is within Dao—
thus Heaven is not the greatest.

This Dao is vast beyond measure, containing all yet bearing none—
thus the name *Great* is perhaps fitting.

*Great* is called *Passing*;
*Passing* is called *Distant*;
*Distant* is called *Returning*.

*Passing*—unending flow.
*Distant*—boundless duration.
*Returning*—the nameless void.

For all things exist, yet Dao exists in none—
nonexistence and existence are opposites, hence *Returning*.

The single word *Great* is insufficient to encompass Dao,
so it is further described as vast yet unceasing.
Unceasing and enduring, enduring yet void—
this is Dao. If it had form, it would not be Dao.

The following passage states:
*"Returning is the movement of Dao;
all things beneath Heaven arise from existence,
existence arises from nonexistence."*

Zhuangzi said:
*"At the utmost beginning, there was nonexistence;
nonexistence had no name."*

This refers to the same.

Thus, Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
and the Sage-King is great.

Within the realm, there are four greats,
and the Sage-King occupies one of them.

*Sage-King* refers to the positioned Sage.

Though Dao is the greatest throughout past and present,
with none to compare, why then speak of Heaven, Earth, the Sage, and Dao as four greats?

Heaven and Earth attain greatness through Dao,
the Sage attains greatness through Dao—
their greatness comes from possessing Dao.

The *King* is followed by *also*,
and it is specially noted that the King occupies one—
for the greatest *qi* is Heaven,
the greatest form is Earth,
while the Sage’s body stands slight between them.
Since his Dao aligns with Heaven and Earth,
his greatness also aligns with theirs,
and is not measured by the size of his *qi*, form, or body.

Humans model Earth,
Earth models Heaven,
Heaven models Dao,
Dao models naturalness.

*Humans* refers to the Sage.
*Model* means to align, as with a level—
the Sage’s greatness comes from aligning with Earth,
Earth’s greatness comes from aligning with Heaven,
Heaven’s greatness comes from aligning with Dao,
Dao’s greatness comes from being natural.

It is not that there exists another *naturalness* beyond Dao—
*naturalness* is the void without name.

**Chapter 21**
Heavy is the root of light,
stillness the sovereign of agitation.
Root means origin;
agitation means motion;
sovereign means master.
Light takes heavy as its origin,
motion takes stillness as its master.

Thus, the virtuous one walks all day without leaving his baggage train.
The virtuous traveler rides in a fine carriage,
the teacher rides in a war chariot—
both are light vehicles.
Behind the light chariot comes the baggage wagon,
laden with bedding, clothing, food, and necessities—
this is the heavy wagon.
Though riding in a light chariot, the virtuous one is called *shànrén*—
one skilled in affairs.
The unvirtuous one is called *bùshànrén*—
one unskilled in affairs.

A teacher is one whom people revere and take as a model.
Resources are like wealth given to others,
enabling them to rely upon it and thereby achieve something.
If one is virtuous and the other is not,
when their virtues and flaws are contrasted,
people clearly see that the latter does not measure up to the former—
then the virtuous one may serve as teacher to the unvirtuous.

If one is unvirtuous and the other is virtuous,
when their flaws and virtues are contrasted,
people see that the former falls short of the latter—
then the unvirtuous one becomes a resource for the virtuous.
This is called *zī*—
to use another’s flaws to establish one’s own virtue.
Yet virtue and vice are opposing names—
how could there be a world of the Dao?

The following text states:
The enlightened one makes the world’s people
neither claim the name of virtue
nor the name of vice.
They neither honor their teacher
nor cherish their resources.
Though knowing the great confusion,
this is called *yàomiào*—
the utmost subtlety.

*Ài* means to take pleasure in.
*Yào* means the utmost extreme.
*Miào* means profound and unfathomable.
Though the unvirtuous encounter the virtuous,
they may take them as teachers,
yet they do not honor them—
for they do not wish to name them as virtuous.
Though the virtuous encounter the unvirtuous,
they may use them as resources,
yet they do not cherish them—
for they do not wish to name them as unvirtuous.
The names of virtue and vice are both extinguished,
all uniformly merged in the Mysterious Oneness—
indiscriminable, even the wise are greatly confused,
not knowing which to hold as virtue or vice.
This is the utmost subtlety, called *yàomiào*.

**Chapter 23**
The first two sections speak of the Sage’s virtue beyond naming,
the latter two of ordinary people’s virtue and vice being named.
The unnamed, unexalted virtue is called *xímíng*—
the concealment of brilliance.
The undifferentiated virtue and vice is called *yàomiào*.

Knowing whiteness while guarding blackness
is the model for all under Heaven.
To be the model for all under Heaven
is to maintain unerring virtue,
returning to the Boundless.

Knowing strength while guarding weakness
is the stream for all under Heaven.
To be the stream for all under Heaven
is to never depart from virtue,
returning to the infant.

Knowing honor while guarding humiliation
is the valley for all under Heaven.
To be the valley for all under Heaven
is to have sufficient virtue,
returning to the uncarved block.

This chapter’s intent is to return from virtue to its origin,
restoring the Way of the Primordial.
Virtue is the unfilled, voided virtue,
thus preferring black to whiteness,
weakness to strength,
humiliation to honor.
Though knowing what to guard,
one may admire the other’s excellence,
yet prefers to hold fast to this and remain lowly.

The model of the carriage,
the stream of flowing water,
the valley—
all mean to remain lowly.
Thus, one’s virtue remains unerring,
never departing, and suffices within oneself.
Having preserved this voided virtue,
one may return to the Primordial Way—
as Zhuangzi says, *"When virtue reaches its peak, it returns to its origin."*

The Boundless,
the infant,
the uncarved block—
all illustrate the Primordial Way.
The uncarved block, when scattered, becomes vessels;
the Sage, when employed, becomes officials.
Thus, the Great Measure does not cut.
The uncarved wood retains its full natural essence;
once split, it becomes shaped vessels.
The Sage, before use, preserves the integrity of inner virtue;
once revealed, becomes officials of the realm.
The ruler of all under Heaven is the Son of Heaven;
the ruler of a state is the feudal lord.
The first three sections speak of returning from the branches to the root;
these two lines speak of returning from the root to the branches.

Yet though the block is already scattered, it still longs to return whole—
as if it had never scattered.
Though the Sage is already employed, they still long to return whole—
as if they had never been used.
For what is not scattered is scattering,
what is not used is using.
Whatever is cut requires a blade to sever its wholeness,
but the Great Measure cuts without cutting—
thus it does not sever.

The Great Scattering is not scattering,
the Great Use is not using—
also like the Great Measure that does not cut.

**Chapter 24**
If one would take all under Heaven and act upon it,
I see that it cannot be done.
To take all under Heaven means to make it willingly submit to oneself.
To act means to force it.
If one’s virtue is abundant,
the people will submit of their own accord.
If one instead uses force,
how could they willingly submit?

All under Heaven is a divine vessel—
it cannot be acted upon.
To act upon it brings ruin,
to grasp it brings loss.
The vessel of all under Heaven is the greatest of instruments,
governed by the divine—
it cannot be seized by force or scheming.
Ruined means it fails;
those who act upon it with force,
desiring success, instead fail—
for they cannot make all under Heaven submit to them.
Thus, the one who acts upon it brings ruin.

**Chapter 25**

To take Heaven under Heaven before having it is already impossible to achieve through action, and to retain it after having it is also impossible to preserve through deliberate scheming. It is like a precious vessel—if one constantly clutches it in hand, never letting it go for an instant, fearing it might be lost, one will instead fail to safeguard it from ruin and loss. Hence, it is said: *"To grasp it brings loss."*

All things either move forward or follow behind, either warm with breath or chill with wind, either grow strong or weaken, either flourish or collapse. Therefore, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes extravagance. This continues the thought from *"To grasp it brings loss"* in speaking of the Way of retaining Heaven under Heaven.

Those who hold Heaven under Heaven—how can they ensure it will always remain theirs without perishing? The cycles of gain and loss, survival and ruin, are like the eight opposites—forward and following, breath and wind, strength and weakness, flourishing and collapse—contrasting yet interdependent. The Sage knows this inevitable progression and governs accordingly.

All things that grow too strong must decline, and decline is the beginning of ruin. Only by preventing excess can one avoid decline—and thus, ruin. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are the times of utmost fullness. To remove excess is to keep things in a state of moderation. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of simplicity. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of restraint. If one does not allow things to grow too strong, then Heaven under Heaven can be preserved from ruin.

Master Zhao said: *"Drinking wine should only reach a light intoxication, never full drunkenness; admiring flowers should stop at half-bloom, never until they wither."* This is the same meaning.

Master Su said: Some things move forward, others follow behind; some warm with breath, others chill with wind; some grow stronger, others weaken; some flourish, others collapse. These are the natural ways of things, inevitable forces that cannot be avoided. The foolish cling to self-interest and seek gain, attempting to resist or defy them—only to meet disaster, either in ruin or defeat. Only the Sage knows these cannot be reversed, so they follow them naturally, removing excess, removing extravagance, removing extravagance, preventing them from reaching extremes, and thus Heaven under Heaven faces no calamity.

Master Dong Si said: The Sage knows that the interplay of circumstances is the natural order, so they follow nature without allowing things to overflow and exceed.

**On aiding the ruler with the Dao, one does not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven. Such actions invite retribution.**

Master Wang said: Even when aiding the ruler with the Dao, one must not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven—how much less should the ruler themselves, who embody the Dao?

Master Su said: The Sage uses arms only when absolutely necessary. If one uses force to dominate Heaven under Heaven without necessity, even if they succeed, disaster will return to punish them. The kings of Chu, Qi, Qin, and Han—some perished themselves, others brought ruin to their descendants. These are the things men abhor, the things ghosts detest, and none have escaped.

Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow. After a great campaign, there will surely be years of famine.

Master Zheng’s commentary: The army seizes the people’s strength, so thorns and brambles grow; the ruler defies the natural order, so there are years of famine.

Master Su said: Where the army is, farming is neglected, fields lie fallow. After war, the killing energy prevails, and crops are ruined. This is true of all wars—how much more so when using force to dominate Heaven under Heaven?

The virtuous act decisively but do not seek to dominate. They act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride, and only when there is no other choice—this is called acting decisively without domination.

The best use of arms is to resolve chaos in a single decisive moment, not to delay battle for victory and claim it as domination.

Master Su said: *"Do not boast, do not glory, do not be proud, act only when there is no other choice"*—these are the ways of not dominating.

Things that flourish must grow old—this is called *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin. Those who follow the Way remain like infants or young children, and thus do not grow old. But those who grow old like the strong must inevitably grow old—this is *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin, meaning they cannot endure.

Master Su said: All things that grow strong must grow old—there is no exception. Only those who follow the Way, though complete, appear incomplete; though full, appear empty; never growing strong, thus never growing old, never dying.

To dominate Heaven under Heaven with arms is the height of strength—how could it not grow old?

Fine arms are an omen of misfortune. Things often resent them, so those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them. *"Fine"* here means *"praised."* *"Misfortune"* means no blessings, only disaster. *"Dwell upon"* means to willingly take up such a path.

The gentleman, at home, values the left; in war, values the right. This speaks to the reality of not dwelling upon it—preferring the position one does not normally occupy, refusing to place oneself in the role of war.

Arms are instruments of misfortune, not the tools of the gentleman. Used only when there is no other choice, they should be approached with calm indifference.

Victory is not a cause for celebration—it is an instrument of killing, a bringer of disaster, not a joyous deed. *"Calm"* means without delight; *"indifference"* means without attachment—this is not what the heart desires. *"For the superior"* means it is praiseworthy not to delight in war. Victory, though achieved, is not a cause for pride. To take pride in victory is to take pleasure in killing. Those who take pleasure in killing cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven.

This extends the idea that victory is not a cause for celebration. If one regards victory in war as a praiseworthy deed, then one takes pleasure in killing—and such cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven. Ultimately, this is a warning.

Joyous matters are honored on the left; ominous matters on the right. The left general is stationed on the left, the supreme general on the right.

This further elaborates the earlier meaning of not dwelling upon things.

When many are killed, one should mourn them with tears of sorrow; when victorious in war, one should conduct the rites as for a funeral. This again expounds the earlier meaning of not finding it beautiful.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
*The Dao is ever nameless.*
This speaks of the Dao.
Though *pu* is small, none under Heaven dare to submit to it.
If lords and kings can uphold it, all things will willingly submit to them.
*Pu* refers to the Dao—though it pervades the six directions, gathering it cannot fill a single grasp, hence it is called "small."
The most exalted is the Dao; thus, those who embody this Dao can rule all under Heaven, and none under Heaven dare submit to them.
"Lords" refers to rulers of a single state; "kings" refers to rulers of all under Heaven.
If they can uphold this Dao, then all things will honor them as sovereign, and willingly submit.
*Self* here means not that I desire them to be so, but that they are so of their own accord.
Heaven and Earth unite, and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.
The function of the Dao is universal under Heaven, like the qi of Heaven and Earth uniting to descend as sweet dew—though no one directs it, it naturally reaches all things.
All things are nourished within this Dao, so those who embody the Dao can be sovereign over all things, and all things willingly submit to them.
Master Su said: The sweet dew covers all things without exception.
The Sage embodies the Dao to respond to all existence, just as dew reaches everywhere, thus able to make all things submit.

*At first, there was naming.*
This speaks of *virtue/power*.
*At first* refers to the Dao.
*To make* is to create.
Just as saying "to make" is to do.
That which has a name is *virtue/power*.
The Dao is nameless; when the Dao acts as *virtue/power*, then it has a name.
Now that the name exists,
Then one should also know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop prevents ruin.
When the Dao, though nameless, acts as *virtue/power*, then the name exists.
Thus, those who use this *virtue/power* should know to stop at *virtue/power*, not descending further.
*Jiang* is like the *Jiang* people’s *jiang* (general), a term used in speech without urgency.
Laozi ranks the Dao as the highest *virtue/power*, saying it is above *virtue/power*, and *ren* as the lower *virtue/power*, saying it is below *virtue/power*.
He also says: lose the Dao, then there is *virtue/power*; lose *virtue/power*, then there is *ren*; lose *ren*, then there is *yi*; lose *yi*, then there is *li*.
Thus, he emphasizes *Dao* and *virtue/power* while dismissing *ren* and *yi*, for *ren* and *yi* are inferior to *virtue/power*.
This chapter speaks of *virtue/power* and says, "Then one should also know when to stop."
Its meaning is: from non-being to being, one should know to stop at *virtue/power* and not descend further.
If *virtue/power* has a name, it is already inferior to the Dao. Can it descend further to *virtue/power*?
Knowing to stop at *virtue/power* is still not far from the Dao.
*Not ruin* means not to be exhausted or depleted, meaning it can endure long without decay.
Master Su said: Would the Sage pursue fame while forgetting *pu* or chase the superficial while losing the fundamental? Thus, he rides through all transformations without ruin.
The Dao’s presence under Heaven is like rivers and valleys converging into the sea.
The earlier text spoke of going from non-being to being, stopping at *virtue/power*.
This again speaks of returning from being to non-being, returning to the Dao.
Truly, the Dao’s presence under Heaven is like the sea, where all streams converge.
*Virtue/power* is like the valleys and streams—when *virtue/power* returns to the Dao, it is like these streams uniting in the sea.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
*Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*

**Chapter Twenty-Eighth**

He who overcomes others has strength, but he who overcomes himself is strong.
The wise know others—this is mere outward wisdom.
He who knows himself can fully realize his true nature, and thus is called *enlightened*.
He who has strength can overcome others—this is mere outward force.
He who overcomes himself can conquer his own self, and thus is called *strong*.

The contented man is rich; the resolute man has will.
He who fully realizes his true nature and aligns with *Dao*’s decree
lacks nothing to covet and always has abundance—only the *enlightened* can do this.
He who conquers himself and courageously pursues goodness
holds firm to his principles and never falters—only the *strong* can do this.

He who does not lose his foundation endures long;
he who dies yet does not perish attains true *longevity*.
Only the *enlightened* and the *strong*
reveal the true and uphold the firm,
until all dross is purified and functions are perfected,
thought and action merge, and spirit and transformation coalesce.

In life, he abides where he is, yet his mind remains unlost, steadfast from beginning to end—thus he is called *enduring*.
After departing this world, though his dwelling is gone, his mind persists, undivided through ages—thus he is called *long-lived*.

---
**A Questioner Asked:**
The *Way* of Laozi holds that obscurity is *enlightenment*, weakness is *strength*—yet this chapter speaks of *enlightenment* and *strength*. How so?

**Response:**
Laozi’s *enlightenment* is not true obscurity within; outwardly, it appears so.
His *strength* is not true weakness within; outwardly, it seems so.
His obscurity and weakness are remedies for external concerns.
His *enlightenment* and *strength* are prescriptions for the inner self.
Both paths proceed without contradiction.

The Great *Dao* is vast—it can be taken from left or right.
*Vast* means boundless, like water overflowing.
The *Dao*’s breadth pervades all—now left, now right—
wherever it is, it is there; take it from any side, it is always sufficient.

All things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim credit.
When its work is done, it does not dwell on it.
It clothes and covers all things yet claims no mastery,
ever without desire—this may be called *small*.

This elaborates on how all things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim credit.
In spring’s birth, the *Dao* pervades all things,
clothing them like garments, covering them like blankets—
the *Elemental* and *Prosperous* spreads through all classes.
The *Elemental* and *Prosperous* is its universal reach,
yet the *Dao* does not rule as their master.
*Ever without desire* means it acts without intent.
This is the One branching into myriad forms—
the *Dao*’s division reaching its smallest extent.
Can it truly be called *small*?
Indeed, it cannot.
If it could be named, then it would not be the *Dao* of
not claiming credit, not ruling, and being without desire.

It nourishes all things, yet none know its mastery—
this may be called *great*.
This elaborates on how, when its work is done, it does not dwell on it.
In winter’s retreat, all things return to their roots,
converging into unity—
the *Advantageous* and *Enduring* secures the sacred origin.
The *Advantageous* and *Enduring* is its return to unity,
yet none know who rules them.
This is the myriad forms merging into the One—
the *Dao*’s totality reaching its greatest extent.
Can it truly be called *great*?
Indeed, it cannot.
If it could be named, then it would not be the *Dao* of
not dwelling on its work, or being unknown as master.

Some may doubt that beneath *unknown master*, the phrase *ever without name* is omitted.
The phrases *may be called small* and *may be called great*
are rhetorical questions, not direct assertions.
Though the word *hu* (乎) is absent at their ends,
its implication remains, as in:
*Can one truly not depart from it?*
*Can one truly be like an infant?*
*Can one truly be without blemish?*

能无为乎？
能为雌乎？
能无知乎？
Though the phrase *"one origin without six characters"* lacks the *"hu"* (乎), interpreters must still infer its interrogative intent—such is its pattern.

Again, as in the *Great Odes* it says:
*"Is the Zhou dynasty not illustrious?"*
*"Are the Emperor’s commands not timely?"*
Yet the poetry simply states:
*"The Zhou is not illustrious,"*
*"The Emperor’s commands are not timely,"*
—of the same kind.

Thus, the Sage can achieve the *great* precisely because they do not claim it for themselves, and so they achieve the *great*.

This chapter speaks of the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth, yet concludes with the Sage—for the Sage is one with Heaven and Earth.
When the year’s work is complete, all things return—
the *Dao* reaches its greatest extent,
yet Heaven and Earth do not dwell on their work,
and all things remain unaware of their master.
Thus, though the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth is great,
they do not consider themselves great.

So too the Sage—
and thus they can achieve the *great*,
for though their *Dao* is great,
they do not claim it as their own,
and so they achieve the *great* indeed.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
*Grasping the Great Image, the world turns toward it.*
*Turning toward it brings no harm—*
*peace, stability, and ease.*

*"Grasping"* means embodying without defiance.
*The Great Image* is the *Dao*—
as the next passage states:
*"The Great Image has no form; the *Dao* is hidden, nameless."*

*"Turning"* means returning.
*"No harm"* means *advantage*.
It speaks of the Sage who embodies the *Dao*—
toward whom all under Heaven turn.
Once the people turn,
the Sage governs by not exploiting their advantage.
For if one exploits advantage with advantage,
there is both advantage and harm.
But if one governs by not exploiting advantage,
there is constant advantage without harm—
and so the people may dwell in enduring peace,
enduring stability,
enduring ease.

*Political Harmony* comments:
*"Peace means no danger; stability means no deceit;*
*ease means comprehensive governance."*

*Music and feasts—*
*guests depart, leaving only passing delight.*
*The *Dao* spoken of is bland, without taste.*
*To see it is insufficient; to hear it is insufficient.*
*To use it is to exhaust it not.*
*"Exhaust"* means *complete*—
for all external advantages cannot endure,
yet the *Dao*’s advantage to humanity,
through not exploiting advantage,
endures.
*Music* refers to songs, dances, and festive appearances;
*feasts* refer to food and banquets, to hospitality.
Though music and feasts are set to delight guests,
once the guests have passed,
their sounds and flavors cease—
a fleeting pleasure that cannot last the day.
But the *Dao* is not like feasts to be consumed,
nor like music with sounds and forms to be seen or heard—
yet to use it brings enduring peace,
enduring stability,
enduring ease,
without ever being exhausted.
It is not mere fleeting delight—
hence, *"its use cannot be exhausted."*

---
**Chapter Thirty**
*When one seeks to gather,*
*one must first let it expand;*

**Chapter Thirty-One**
*When one seeks to weaken it,*
*one must first make it strong;*
*when one seeks to discard it,*
*one must first exalt it;*
*when one seeks to take it,*
*one must first give it.*
This is called *subtle luminosity*.

*Obscure* means *close*; *expand* means *open*.
Laozi speaks of *reversal* as the movement of the Dao,
and says, *"The profound virtue is deep and distant,
contrary to all things."*
Thus, what he does is broadly contrary to common perception,
making him inscrutable.
Hence, he uses these eight paired events as analogies,
culminating in the six characters: *soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong*—
just as the previous chapter first used five analogies—
*good governance, good speech, good strategy, good closure, good resolution*—
to illustrate its meaning.

The strategists of Sunzi and Han Feizi
employed their schemes to ensnare others in ruin,
yet people remained unaware.
Scholars claim this stems from Laozi’s teachings,
though their misuse distorts his intent.
Who would dare accept Laozi’s "giving" and still suspect his motives?
This is excessive doubt.

The commentators, seeking to defend him,
resort to evasion—
both failing to grasp the truth.

What cannot be seen is called *subtle*;
*subtle luminosity* means concealing what is visible,
making it unseen—
just as the previous chapter spoke of *borrowing luminosity*.
People see only the expanding, strengthening, exalting, and giving,
yet fail to perceive the intended obscuring, weakening, discarding, and taking.
Thus, it is called *subtle luminosity*.
*Obscure* is pronounced *xī*.

*Soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong.*
If they are hard and I seek to overcome them with hardness,
if they are strong and I seek to overcome them with strength—
is this not difficult?
But if I treat myself with softness and weakness,
the hard and strong will not resent me,
and yet I shall ultimately overcome them—
how so?
Because I act contrary to their expectations,
making them inscrutable.

Master Su said:
*When the world’s hard and strong clash,*
*I alone remain soft and weak in waiting.*
*When the great are wounded and the small perish,*
*I, without contention, await their demise—*
*this is how I overcome them.*

Yet the Sage does not deliberately act thus to conquer things.
He knows the natural course of affairs
and abides in their natural order.

Fish cannot escape the depths,
nor should a state’s sharpest tools be displayed.
If fish escape the depths,
they are easily seized by others.
If a state’s sharpest tools are displayed,
people see their use and seek to emulate or surpass them—
then my advantage is no longer advantageous.

If fish remain in the depths,
if sharp tools are not displayed,
they become inscrutable—
this is *subtle luminosity*.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
The Dao acts without action,
yet nothing remains undone.
The Dao’s *non-action* endures without change,
not merely for a moment—
hence, it is called *constant non-action*.
Though it does nothing,
it accomplishes all that must be done.
If *non-action* leads to neglect,
what use is there in *non-action*?

This *non-action* is simply being at ease in one’s nature.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
all things would transform of their own accord.

If lords and kings could uphold this *non-action*,
though they had no intention of transforming things,
things would transform themselves.
When transformation is about to arise,
I shall restrain it with the *nameless simplicity*.
The *nameless simplicity* will then desire nothing.
*Desire* means deliberate action.
*Arise* means *emerge*.
Those who have not yet fully attained the Dao of *non-action*
will, upon seeing things transform, impulsively desire to guide them—
but once desire arises, it is no longer *non-action*.
*I desire what arises from me*—
*restrain* means to suppress and settle.
*The nameless simplicity* refers to this Dao of *non-action*.
When desire to act emerges,
it must be suppressed by this *nameless simplicity*—
this is the mindful regulation of desire.
Once desire is suppressed by this *nameless simplicity*,
desire itself will cease to desire—
this is the *non-desire* of quiet resolve.

With *non-desire* in stillness,
the world will align itself.
*Stillness* is the return to the beginning of action.
When desire to act is suppressed by the Dao,
desire ceases, and action becomes still—
thus, though there is no intent to rectify the world,
the world will rectify itself.
This is no different from how all things transform of their own accord.
Some act from ease, some from benefit—
yet their outcomes are one.

---
*This chapter’s first two sections speak of non-action while things transform themselves;
the latter two speak of preferring stillness while the world aligns itself.*

The opening lines of the **Upper Section** read: *"The highest virtue does not claim virtue,"* hence the chapter is named after *virtue*. The title carries no inherent meaning—commentators mistakenly claim the Upper Section speaks solely of the *Dao*, while the Lower Section speaks solely of *virtue*, a grave error.

Some texts render this as *The Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, but in truth, the *Dao Classic* and the *Virtue Classic* each take their names from the first character of their respective sections. Later scholars conflated the two titles into *The Dao and Virtue Classic*, though the work is not named after the two characters *Dao* and *virtue* themselves.

*"The highest virtue does not claim virtue,"* and thus it has virtue.
*"The lower virtue does not lose virtue,"* and thus it lacks virtue.
Here, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.

The highest virtue is above virtue—it is the *Dao*.
The lower virtue is below virtue—it is *benevolence*.
The *Dao* acts without action, and does not treat virtue as its affair, hence *"does not claim virtue."*
Those with virtue possess virtue within the *Dao*.
Warm and nurturing, they fear losing virtue, hence *"does not lose virtue."*
Those without virtue cannot truly possess virtue.

The highest virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.
The lower virtue acts, yet it is burdened with effort.
Again, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.
*"With"* means *"to employ."* The *Dao* acts without action and requires no effort, while *benevolence* acts and requires effort.

The highest *benevolence* acts yet leaves nothing undone.
The highest *righteousness* acts yet is burdened with effort.
Here, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.
The highest *benevolence*—#1—is above *benevolence;* it is *virtue*.
The highest *righteousness* is above *righteousness;* it is *benevolence*.
Though *virtue* acts, it still leaves nothing undone, yet it cannot match the *Dao*’s effortless non-action. Still, it surpasses *benevolence*, which acts with burdened effort.

The highest *rites* act, yet none respond—
they roll up their sleeves and press forward.
This speaks solely of *righteousness*.
The highest *rites* are above *rites;* they are *righteousness*.
*"Roll up"* means *"to push aside,"* akin to *"to brush back."*
*"Press forward"* means *"to approach."*
When *righteousness* fails to move others, though one acts, none respond.
If people do not come to me, then I shall go to them—
thus, they brush back their sleeves upon their arms and march forward to approach them,
vividly depicting their labored and clumsy state.

Thus, one loses the *Dao* and only then has *virtue*;
one loses *virtue* and only then has *benevolence*;
one loses *benevolence* and only then has *righteousness*;
one loses *righteousness* and only then has *rites*.
This concludes the preceding text and introduces the following.

*Rites*, though thin in loyalty and trust, are the beginning of disorder.
*Prescience*, though the bloom of the *Dao*, is the start of folly.
This speaks of *rites*, wisdom, loyalty, and trust together.
As *virtue* grows thin, it gradually transforms:
once into *benevolence*, twice into *righteousness*, thrice into *rites*—
and loyalty and trust, thick in *virtue*, grow thin.
*Rites* seek order without chaos, yet they found disorder—
hence, *"the beginning of disorder."*
*Prescience* is akin to foresight and wisdom.
The *Dao* is like the fruit of a tree.
Before its birth, its essence lies within—
the embryo not yet revealed.
After its birth, *virtue* is its root,
*benevolence* its trunk,
*righteousness* its branches,
*rites* its leaves,
and wisdom its bloom.
Root, trunk, branches, leaves, and bloom all arise from the *Dao*.
Wisdom seeks enlightenment without folly,
yet it brings folly into being—
hence, *"the start of folly."*

Thus, the noble one dwells in what is thick, not what is thin,
in what is real, not what is superficial—
hence, they discard the latter and take the former.
This concludes the preceding text:
*"Dwelling in what is thick"* means valuing *virtue* over *rites*;
*"in what is real"* means embodying the *Dao* without relying on wisdom.
*"Thin"* refers to superficiality; *"thick"* to substance.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**

The opening chapter of the Upper Section divides *Dao* and *virtue*,
while the opening chapter of the Lower Section divides *Dao*, *virtue*, *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom.
My *Dao*, *virtue*, *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom
are what all things under heaven share as their origin—*Dao*—
and what beings receive from heaven and earth—*virtue*.
*Virtue* is the general term; specifically, it is fourfold.
To receive the primal essence of heaven and earth in nurturing life is *virtue*—
and warm, tender, and loving, it is called *benevolence*.
To receive the benefit of heaven and earth in gathering life is *virtue*—
and decisive and measured, it is called *righteousness*.
To receive the flourishing of heaven and earth in sustaining life is *virtue*—
and radiant and refined, it is called *rites*.
To receive the steadfastness of heaven and earth in preserving life is *virtue*—
and complete and knowing, it is called *wisdom*.
The *Dao* is nameless; *virtue* is named.
From *virtue* arise *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom—
each descent grows lower.

Thus, this chapter ranks the *Dao* as first, above *virtue*—
hence, *"the highest virtue."*
It ranks *virtue* as second, above *benevolence*—
hence, *"the highest benevolence."*
It ranks *benevolence* as third, below *virtue* yet above *righteousness*—
hence, *"lower virtue, higher righteousness."*
It ranks *righteousness* as fourth, above *rites*—
hence, *"rites."*
And collectively, it says:
*"One loses the Dao and only then has virtue;
one loses virtue and only then has benevolence;
one loses benevolence and only then has righteousness;
and again, one loses righteousness and only then has rites,"*
making *rites* the fifth.
It first speaks of *rites*, then of *prescience*—
making wisdom the sixth.

If compared to the six positions of the *Yijing* hexagrams,
then *Dao* is the first, *virtue* the second, *benevolence* the third,
*righteousness* the fourth, *rites* the fifth, and *wisdom* the sixth.
The *Dao* is the substance, wisdom its bloom—
substance is real, bloom is superficial.
The first and sixth form the beginning and end.
*Virtue* is the root, *rites* the leaves—
roots are thick, leaves are thin.
The second and fifth are the world’s response.
*Benevolence* is the trunk, *righteousness* the branches—
trunks are single, branches split.
The third and fourth are neighboring positions.

The *Dao* is like Heaven—
encompassing and covering all things in their origin.
*Virtue* is like Earth—
loyalty and trust as its soil, the foundation for the four virtues.
*Benevolence* is like Spring—
*virtue* (Earth) nurtures wood.
*Righteousness* is like Autumn—
*benevolence* (wood) nurtures metal.
*Rites* are like Summer—
*righteousness* (metal) nurtures fire.
*Wisdom* is like Winter—
*rites* (fire) nurtures water.
Each transmits what it conquers.

The *Dao* is first, *virtue* second, *benevolence* third, *righteousness* fourth, *rites* fifth, *wisdom* sixth.
The highest *virtue* is without *virtue*,
The highest *benevolence*—
The lowest *virtue* does not lose its way,
The highest *righteousness*—
The highest *rites*—
Thus, having *virtue* is to have none,
None is to act without action,
Action is to have *virtue*,
*Virtue* is to act,
*Virtue* is to act,
Yet thin is the loyalty and trust—
This is the bloom of the *Dao*.
To have it is to have it,
To not have it is to have it,
To have it is to have it—
No response, the origin of chaos,
The beginning of folly.

Those of old who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear,
Earth attained the One and became tranquil,
The Spirit attained the One and became numinous,
The Valley attained the One and became full,
All things attained the One and came to life,
The sovereign attained the One and became the standard for the world.
This is how the One was achieved.

The One is the *virtue* of emptiness and void,
As the previous chapter said, "embracing the One,"
As "making it One," as the later chapter says, "the *Dao* gives birth to the One"—
All speak of this.
Zhuangzi called it the Great One,
And simply called it the One.
This is the natural *Dao* in action—
Its use is empty yet not filled,
Retiring yet not leading,
Soft yet not rigid,
Weak yet not strong.

The previous chapter spoke of this repeatedly,
But this chapter fully unfolds its depths.
To attain it means to take this One as *virtue*,
And thus be as such.

Heaven, Earth, Spirit, and Valley—
Names differ, reality is the same.
What moves and becomes clear is called Heaven,
What condenses and becomes tranquil is called Earth.
The Spirit is the subtle interplay of the two *qi* between things,
As Zhang Zai said, "Two in one, hence unfathomable"—
Its use responds without measure, hence numinous.
The Valley is the empty space between things,
As Zhang Zai said, "Empty and void is *qi*"—
Its *qi* fills without gap, hence full.

*Acquiring* (贞) is like the trunk of a tree—
To be the standard for the world is to be the people’s ultimate.
Saying Heaven is clear, Earth tranquil, Spirit numinous, Valley full,
All things perpetually alive—
The sovereign stands above the world as the people’s ultimate,
And this is how the One is achieved.

If Heaven lacks clarity, it would crack,
If Earth lacks tranquility, it would tremble,
If the Spirit lacks numinosity, it would falter,
If the Valley lacks fullness, it would dry up,
If all things lack life, they would perish,
If the sovereign lacks the standard, his noble height would falter.

To lack it means to lack this *virtue* yet use it.
Crack—splitting apart.
Tremble—shaking.
Falter—unable to respond and thus be numinous.
Dry up—unable to fill and thus be full.
Perish—extinguished and not alive.
Falter—toppling and losing its place.

Thus, the noble relies on the base as its root,
The high relies on the low as its foundation.
Hence the sovereign calls himself "lonely, bereft, unworthy"—
Is this not taking the base as root?

No?
This chapter speaks of the six together,
But here, following the words "noble" and "high" above,
It speaks specifically of the sovereign.
For the sovereign’s position is noble and high,
Yet the *virtue* of emptiness and void does not seek fullness—
Only to place oneself in the lowly.

"Lonely" as without father,
"Bereft" as without husband,
"Unworthy" as unvirtuous—
All are unflattering names,
Not what anyone would wish to possess,
Yet the sovereign calls himself thus—
This is placing oneself in the lowly.

Earlier it said, "The base is the root, the low the foundation,"
Then only said, "The base is the root"—
Omitting the second to encompass both—
A condensed style.

Thus, the highest praise is without praise,
Not wanting to gleam like jade,
Or clatter like stone.

*Jingjing*—the appearance of jade,
*Luo Luo*—the appearance of stone.
When a person’s reputation is loudly proclaimed,
It is but shallow praise—
It must efface all reputation.
When no one can be praised,
That is the height of praise—
Also the intent of placing oneself in the lowly,
Not wanting to distinguish good and evil
So that people see the *jingjing* purity as jade,
The *luo luo* coarseness as stone.

Both passages speak of the *virtue* of emptiness and void—
Thus is the sovereign’s attainment of the One.

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
The contrary is the *Dao*’s motion,
The weak is the *Dao*’s use.
The *Dao*’s stillness is non-being,
Its motion must necessarily oppose being—
The contrary is non-being yet not non-being.
The *Dao*’s essence is emptiness,
Its use must necessarily be weak—
The weak is empty yet not filled.
These two sentences are the chapter’s key.

All things under Heaven are born of being,
Being is born of non-being.
From here to the attainment of the utmost goodness—
All elaborate on "the contrary is the *Dao*’s motion."

All things arise from *qi* gathering into form,
Form from *qi*, *qi* from the *Dao*—
*Qi* and form are being, yet the *Dao* is non-being.
Non-being and being differ—
Hence "contrary," speaking of how the *Dao* moves by contradiction.

The superior person, hearing the *Dao*, strives to practice it;
The middle person, hearing the *Dao*, holds it as if it might vanish;

The inferior person, hearing the *Dao*, laughs at it greatly—
Without laughter, it would not be the *Dao*.
This speaks of how people’s understanding
Follows the *Dao*’s motion through contradiction.

The *Dao* opposes things,
Thus only the superior person, with true insight,
Strives to practice it.
The middle person’s insight is insufficient—
They hold it as if it might vanish.
The inferior person, lacking insight,
Laughs at it because it does not conform to worldly expectations.

Few possess this insight—
Hence the *Dao*’s true value.
If all could grasp it,
It would no longer be the *Dao*.

Thus it is said:
These words introduce the next two sections,
Speaking of those who established the *Dao*’s teachings.

The *Dao*’s contradictions are as follows:
The twelve matters below.
The *Dao*’s clarity is like obscurity,
Advancing like retreat,
Leveling like unevenness—
These speak of motion through contradiction.

Preserving brightness by dimming,
Retreating to advance,
Unevenness as balance—
This is how the *Dao* moves.

The virtue of the sage is like a valley,
Great brightness like shame,
Ample gain like insufficiency,
Establishing virtue like laziness,
Authenticity like falseness,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel takes long to form,
The greatest sound is inaudible,
The greatest form is shapeless.

Expanding upon the above contradictions:
A valley’s depth makes it high,
Blemished color is true whiteness,
Narrowness becomes vastness,
Laziness becomes establishment.
Authenticity is true reality—
Yet true reality seems false.
A square must have corners—
The greatest square has none.
Only after completion is it a vessel—
The greatest vessel forms late.
Sounds blend to make music—
The greatest sound is sparse.
Only what is visible is form—
The greatest form is invisible.

The *Dao* is hidden, nameless.
Only the *Dao* brings ultimate fulfillment.
This concludes the meaning of the previous two sections.

The *Dao* hidden in the nameless
Can fully bestow upon all things without depletion.
All the above speak of motion through contradiction.

The *Dao* gives birth to One,
One to Two,
Two to Three,
Three to all things.
All things carry yin while embracing yang,
Their *qi* harmonized in balance.

From here to what the world rarely attains,
It elaborates on how weakness is the *Dao*’s use.

The *Dao* arises from the void,
Generating the pure *qi* of Oneness.
This pure *qi* generates yang and yin,
Dividing into Two,
Then yin and yang merge with the pure *qi* as Three—
Thus it is said to generate Three,
Not an additional Three beyond One and Two.

All things arise from these Three,
Thus in their birth, they carry yin behind and embrace yang before,
With harmonizing *qi* in between.
Harmony means yin and yang are balanced, neither dominant.

All things rely on this harmonizing *qi* for life,
And afterward, to preserve their essence,
They must use this same harmonizing *qi*—
Thus they do not lose their origin.
Since the *qi* of birth is empty yet full,
It is called weakness.
This explains how the *Dao* moves through weakness.

What people despise—
Orphanhood, widowhood, poverty—
The king and duke hold as titles.
This speaks of those who understand
Using weakness as strength.

"Orphan, widow, poor"—
None are names of strength,
Yet these are what people despise,
While kings and dukes take them as titles—
Thus weakness is used.

Therefore, sometimes loss brings gain,
And gain brings loss.
This introduces the next two sections.

What people teach, I also teach:
The overbearing meet no good end.
I will make this my fundamental lesson.

This speaks of using weakness.
*"Overbearing"* also means "strong"—
Beams that span water, pillars that bear roofs,
Both called *liang*, for their strength.
"Not meeting a good end" means dying untimely,
As when Zilu rushed ahead—
The Master said he would not meet a good end,
And later he died in the chaos of Kong Yue’s rebellion.

*"Teaching father"* means fundamental teaching,
Where none stands above.
What people teach, I teach them to use weakness.
The overbearing, unable to yield,
Cannot preserve themselves.
Their strength brings gain but also untimely loss—
This is what is meant by "gain that is loss,"
The most essential lesson for teaching others.

The world’s ultimate softness
Overcomes the world’s ultimate hardness.
No space enters no space—
Thus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.

Again expanding on the teaching of weakness:
Ultimate softness and emptiness are both weakness.
*"Overcomes"* means to trample pebbles.
*"No space"* means no gaps for entry.
Water, the softest, erodes the hardest stone,
*Qi* without substance penetrates walls without seams—
Through the softest, emptiest loss,
Comes the gain of overcoming hardness and entering the unenterable.
Softness overcomes hardness,
Emptiness enters fullness—
All without effort, naturally.
Thus the benefits of *wuwei*.

Unspoken teaching,
The benefits of *wuwei*—
Few in the world attain them.
This concludes the meaning of the previous two sections.

*"Unspoken teaching"* means
That which should be weak, not strong,
Is the fundamental lesson needing no words.

The benefits of *wuwei* lie in the boundless drive of ultimate softness and emptiness—
Its teaching to benefit others surpasses all human instruction.

Those who rely on spoken teaching and deliberate action
Cannot approach this, hence the saying: *"Few attain it."*

All that has been spoken of is the application of weakness.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Five**
Though the previous chapter spoke exclusively of *yongruo* (using weakness),
This chapter opposes it with *fan* (contrary), why?
It is but one meaning in two words:
*Fan* traces the origin of weakness,
While *ruo* points to its actual practice.
To speak of *fan* is to seek *ruo*,
To speak of *ruo* is to oppose all worldly actions—
There is no *fan* beyond *ruo*.

Which is dearer, name or body?
Which is more abundant, body or wealth?
Which brings greater harm, gain or loss?

*"Dear"* means what is loved—
Which is more lovable, name or body?
*"Abundant"* means what is valued—
Which is more valuable, body or wealth?

Name is placed above body,
Wealth below—
A rhetorical device for rhyme alone.

The *Shiji* says:
To gain name and wealth while losing the body
Is worse than losing name and wealth while keeping the body—
Which is more harmful?

Thus, excessive love brings great waste,
Hoarding brings great loss.

*"Love"* refers to love of name.
*"Great"* refers to the body.
Comparing name to body, the body surpasses name—
Yet those who covet name love it excessively,
While love for the body falls short,
Draining spirit and shortening life—
This is how love of name consumes the body’s greatness.
*"Hoarding"* refers to wealth.
*"Thick"* refers to the body.
Comparing wealth to body, the body surpasses wealth—
Yet those who crave wealth hoard excessively,
While valuing the body falls short,
Leading to the loss of life and ruin—
This is how wealth consumes the body’s abundance.

Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
Thus one may endure.

Knowing the inner limits, one is content and not arrogant,
Hence no shame from lost reputation or misconduct.
Knowing external things bring no benefit, one stops and does not seek,
Hence no peril from shortened life or ruin—
Thus one may endure.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**

Great fullness seems deficient,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great excess seems empty,
Yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness seems bent,
Great skill seems clumsy,
Great eloquence seems tongue-tied.

To be full is to be full,
To be excess is to be excess,
To be straight is to be straight,
To be skillful is to be skillful,
To be eloquent is to be eloquent—
This is smallness.

But to be deficient is not to be full,
To be empty is not to be excess,
To be bent is not to be straight,
To be clumsy is not to be skillful,
To be tongue-tied is not to be eloquent—
This is the greatness of fullness, excess, straightness, skill, and eloquence.

The entire *Laozi* follows this principle:
Fundamentally, opposites rely upon each other—
As seen repeatedly in the previous chapter, needing no further explanation.

Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat.
Yang’s agitation overcomes yin’s cold,
Yin’s stillness overcomes yang’s heat—
Again, opposites rely upon each other.

Clarity and stillness are the right way for all under heaven.
*"Clarity and stillness"* is *wuwei*—
The mind, free of dust, motionless.
*"Right"* means to rule as sovereign over all under heaven.

To rule all under heaven is already much—
Yet those who exhaust themselves with action,
How could they succeed?
Only clarity, stillness, and *wuwei*
Do nothing yet accomplish all—
Thus they can rule as the right way for all under heaven,
This is the meaning of opposites relying upon each other.

Some say stillness overcoming heat and agitation overcoming cold
Are paired opposites, each leaning toward one extreme—
But the stillness of clarity and stillness has no opposite,
For stillness contains motion, and motion and stillness align without bias,
Thus it can rule as the right way for all under heaven.

Though the argument is profound,
It is not the original intent.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**
When the Dao prevails under heaven, swift steeds are harnessed to dung carts.
When the Dao does not prevail, warhorses breed in the borderlands.
*"However"* (退, *què*), means to withdraw.
*"Swift steeds"* (走马), are steeds of swiftness.
*"Dung carts"* (粪车), are carts laden with dung.
In ancient times, every sixty-four *ling* made up a *dian*, each contributing warhorses as tribute. In an age of the Dao, all kept to their allotted lands without encroachment or war, so that common steeds were not yoked to war chariots, but rather withdrawn to serve the humble task of dunging the fields.
*"Warhorses"* (戎马), are steeds trained in unison for battle.
*"Borderlands"* (郊), are the contested frontiers between two states.
In an age without the Dao, raiders are called *"invaders"* (寇), and skirmishes erupt beyond the borders, so that warhorses cannot return to be bred within the state’s protection, but instead are born and raised in the wilderness.

The phrase *"dung carts"* in lower commentaries omits the character *"car"*, though *Zhuzi’s Collected Sayings* includes it—yet none know its source.
Now examining: Zhang Heng’s *Eastern Capital Eulogy* states:
*"Swift steeds are withdrawn to dung carts."*
This employs Laozi’s full line, proving that in late Han, the character *"car"* was not yet omitted. Wang Bi’s annotation, being close to Zhang’s time, still retained it—yet later it was accidentally dropped, and subsequent errors led to its omission.
*"Border"* (郊) rhymes with *"lack"* (阙), and omitting *"car"* breaks the rhyme.

No greater crime than desiring what is desirable,
No greater fault than striving to obtain it,
No greater calamity than failing to know contentment.
Thus, the *"contentment"* (足) of knowing contentment is ever content.

Crimes, transgressions, evils, faults, and calamities are all disasters—
Yet calamity surpasses fault.
The spark of war arises from coveting land as desirable.
Knowing it desirable, one schemes to seize it—this is the beginning of disaster.
Obtaining it yet failing to know satiety,
Ever craving more after gaining one ridge, then another—
Then war knows no end, the ultimate disaster.

If each were to abide by their allotted lands,
Not seeking to expand or encroach,
And cultivate the heart’s contentment in self-sufficiency,
Then there would be no greed, no war, and everlasting contentment.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
Not stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven;
Not peering through the window, one beholds the Dao of Heaven.
All things and affairs under heaven are complete within me,
Thus though one does not step beyond the door, one knows them all.

The *"Dao of Heaven"* is the singular source of all principles.
It is grasped through inward observation—
Not like external things, which must be seen through the window before recognition.

The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Not knowing that all is contained within oneself,
One must travel to a place before knowing a matter—
Thus the farther one goes, the less one knows.
How could one not step beyond the door and yet know all under heaven?

*"Not covering"* (不覆) *"to see the Dao"*—
None fail to know the myriad branches while ignorant of the single root.
Thus, no need to repeat.

Therefore, the Sage acts without moving yet arrives,
Sees without gazing yet names,
Accomplishes without doing.
Not waiting to move outward to reach a place,
Thus knowing all under heaven’s affairs.
Not waiting to observe a thing before naming its principle,
Thus not peering through the window yet seeing the Dao of Heaven.
*"Accomplishing without doing"*—
The effect of the two preceding lines:
Only by not moving yet knowing all things,
Not peering yet penetrating the source,
Does one, without any action, see all completed.

---

**Chapter Forty**
Studying brings daily increase;
Practicing the Dao brings daily decrease.
The scholar’s woe is scarcity, thus they strive for breadth—
Thus daily gains are made.
The Daoist returns from having to non-being—
Thus daily losses are sustained.
Decrease again, decrease again,
Until reaching *wuwei*.
When *wuwei* is attained, nothing remains undone.

The Daoist diminishes their deeds,
Decrease again, decrease again—
When all that can be diminished is exhausted,
Then *wuwei* is achieved.
The doer of deeds does but one thing at a time,
Ten things at most—
Yet the things not yet done number in the thousands and ten-thousands,
Beyond reckoning—
How could they all be done?
Only the *wuwei* does nothing,
Thus all things are accomplished without fail.

Those who would take all under heaven
Must first do nothing.
Once action begins,
It is insufficient to take all under heaven.
*"Doing nothing"* means doing nothing at all—*wuwei*.
Yet it is said that those who take all under heaven
Must first be without action,
For virtue overflows and draws all to itself.
If one relies on cunning and force,
How could they take all under heaven?

---

**Chapter Forty-One**
The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as their own.
*Political Harmony* annotates:
The Sage’s heart is empty yet receptive,
Still yet responsive—
Like a mirror reflecting forms,
Taking their beauty or ugliness,
Like a valley echoing sounds,
Responding to their loud or soft.
What constancy could there be?

Dong Sijing says:
The Sage has no self,
Their heart not clinging to things,
Yet all things come and are met with ease.

Wang [Bi] says:
All thought is for responding to things.
The *Book of Documents* states:
*"From myself, the people are enlightened."*
The good, I treat as good;
The ungood, I also treat as good—thus goodness is attained.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—thus trust is attained.
The people’s goodness or ungoodness, trust or distrust—
The Sage does not distinguish right or wrong,
But treats all as good, all as trustworthy—
Not only do the good attain goodness,
The trustworthy attain trust,
But the ungood also attain goodness,
The untrustworthy attain trust.
This is called the people attaining goodness and trust without loss—
Even the ungood and untrustworthy are transformed into goodness and trust,
Thus all attain goodness and trust.

The Sage’s presence under heaven is *"shrunken"* (歙歙),
Muddling the hearts of all.
The people fix their ears and eyes upon them,
The Sage treats them all as children.
*"Shrunken"* (歙歙) conveys contraction.
Wang [Bi] says: *"The heart has no fixed attachment."*
*"Muddling"* (浑) means the mind has no direction.
Some manuscripts render *"shrunken"* as *"fearful"* (惵惵) or *"dreadful"* (怵怵),
Both conveying terror—
Yet Wang Bi writes *"shrunken"* (歙), interpreting it as *"the heart has no fixed attachment,"*
Aligned with the context above and below.

Bo Dong Si Jing remarked: *"Muddling"* (浑) and *"mingling"* (混) mean to dissolve differences and merge the same. *"Treat them all as children"* (皆孩之) means to refrain from discrimination.

Master Su said: Beneath heaven, the good and evil, the trustworthy and deceitful each uphold their own positions and condemn one another. Yet the Sage regards them all equally. When the people fix their ears and eyes upon the Sage, observing His bestowals and withdrawals, He meets them all with the simplicity of an infant—neither favoring nor resenting. Thus, the good and trustworthy do not grow arrogant, while the evil and deceitful do not grow indignant. All are released and transformed, and thus the world settles in harmony.

---
*"Shrunken"* (歙) is pronounced *xī*.
*"Fearful"* (惵) is pronounced *dá-yè*.

**Chapter 41: Birth and Death**

Birth is life; death is return.
To emerge is to arise from non-being into being;
To return is to depart from being into non-being.

Zhuangzi said: *"All things emerge from the Dao/Way, and all return to the Dao/Way."*
He also said: *"Their emergence brings no joy, their return no regret."*
And again: *"Some emerge, some return."*
All take emergence as life and return as death.

There are thirteen types of those who live,
And thirteen types of those who die.
Ten refers to the total count of high, middle, and low ranks,
Generally divided into ten categories.
Three refers to three categories among those ten.

Those who do not shorten their lifespan through anxiety, indulgence, or desire,
Nor fall ill from wind, cold, heat, or dampness,
Nor suffer from the calamities of punishment, war, drowning, or crushing—
These are the thirteen types who live.

Their opposites:
The idle and noble perish from internal harm,
The laboring and lowly from external harm,
The coarse and fierce fail to complete their natural span—
These are the thirteen types who die.
Each of these three types exists within the ten categories.

Among the ten categories, there are also thirteen types who move toward death while living.
Why so?
Because their pursuit of life is excessive.
*"The"* (之) means to direct or hasten.
*"Dynamic"* (动) means action.
*"Pursuit of life"* (生生) means striving to preserve life.
*"Excessive"* (厚) means their intentions are too heavy.

Some prolong life through alchemy but misapply methods,
Others overuse medicine to preserve health,
While some, through excessive caution in dwelling and nourishment, become fragile and brittle.
Among the ten categories, three types act thus—
Their intent is to hasten life, yet their actions instead drive them toward death,
For their obsession with life is unnatural.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life
Fear neither rhinoceros nor tiger when walking on land,
Nor weapons nor soldiers when entering battle.
The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,
The tiger no place to claw with its paw,
The blade no place to lodge its edge.
Why?
Because they have no place of death.

Among the ten categories, three types belong to those who live,
Three to those who die,
And three to those who, though living, move toward death—
Together, they make nine.

Beyond the nine is the One—
The Supreme True Person.

*"Nurturing"* (摄) is like governing or officiating—
Not claiming life as one’s own,
But guiding it as if temporarily overseeing,
With inner stillness as foundation,
Outer gentleness as form,
Solid as wood or stone in ignorance,
Empty as an infant in desirelessness.
Even when facing fierce beasts or cruel men,
They do not flee, yet the beasts and men grow tame and do no harm.
Their dross is dissolved, their vital essence refined,
Their spirit and qi serene as wind or shadow—
Untouchable, ungraspable.
With no substance to die from,
Even if harmed, how could harm take hold?

**Chapter 42: The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**

The Dao/Way gives birth to things,
Virtue/power nurtures them,
Form shapes them,
And circumstances complete them.
Thus, all things reverence the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.

*"Gives birth"* refers to the sprouting of life in spring,
The origin from which all things begin.
*"Nurtures"* refers to their rest and gathering in autumn,
Preserving the harmony of the great unity.
*"Shapes"* refers to the growth of spring-born things in summer,
Enlarging their forms,
So that all things flourish in their kinds.
*"Completes"* refers to their storage in winter,
Perfecting their fruits,
And fulfilling their true nature and destiny.

All things—birth, growth, harvest, and storage—
All arise from the Dao/Way and virtue/power.
Thus, all things honor the Dao/Way as a father,
And virtue/power as a mother.

The Dao/Way and virtue/power are two yet one:
Spring’s birth arises from a single source and disperses,
Hence it is said, *"The Dao/Way gives birth"*—
Yet the Dao/Way is also virtue/power.
Autumn’s harvest gathers from myriad differences into unity,
Hence it is said, *"Virtue/power nurtures"*—
Yet virtue/power is also the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way’s reverence, virtue/power’s honor—
No command enforces them; they are ever naturally so.

Human honor and nobility require designation:
The Son of Heaven’s honor comes from the Mandate of Heaven,
The nobles’ nobility from the Son of Heaven’s command.
But the Dao/Way’s honor and virtue/power’s nobility
Need no such designation—
All things eternally honor and revere them thus.

Thus the Dao/Way gives birth, nurtures, grows, and matures them,
Completes and ripens them,
Nourishes and shelters them.

The previous chapter spoke of *"The Dao/Way gives birth, virtue/power nurtures"*—
Here, only *"the Dao/Way"* is mentioned, for virtue/power is the Dao/Way.
*"Grows"* and *"matures"* elaborate on *"form shapes"* and *"circumstances complete."*
*"Nourishes"* elaborates on *"grows,"*
*"Shelters"* on *"matures"*—
*"Shelters"* means returning to the origin and fulfilling destiny.

To give birth without possession,
To act without reliance,
To grow without domination—
This is called the *Mysterious Virtue/Power*.

*"Give birth"* means to birth and form.
*"Act"* means to nurture and complete.
*"Without possession"* means no intent to birth.
*"Without reliance"* means no deeds to act with.
Like a ruler who thinks and acts without scheming,
Though he governs, he harbors no designs or manipulations.

This encompasses birth, growth, harvest, and storage—
All called *Mysterious Virtue/Power*, yet the Dao/Way is not named,
For the Dao/Way is also virtue/power.

---
**Chapter 43: The Origin of Heaven and Earth**

Heaven and earth have a beginning,
Which serves as the mother of all things beneath heaven.
*"Beginning"* is the Dao/Way.
*"Mother"* is virtue/power.
This origin of heaven and earth
Is the mother of all ten thousand things.

Having obtained its mother,
One comes to know its child.
Having known its child,
One must again guard its mother—
Then the body labors without exhaustion.

When a person is born,
They obtain their mother,
And through this know the child within the mother.
Having known the child within the mother,
If one then guards the mother,
The mother abides, and the child does not depart.

Dong Sizheng says:
*"Humans receive qi to live—
Qi is the mother, the spirit dwelling within qi is the child.
Guarding the mother makes qi focused and the spirit at ease."*

Block the *duì* (mouth),
Close the *mén* (nostrils),
And one will never tire in their lifetime.
Open the *duì*,
And one’s affairs will prosper—
Yet one will never be saved in their lifetime.
This is the method of guarding the mother.

From the *Shuowen Jiezi*:
*"Duì"* is composed of *"bā"* (eight) and the phonetic *"shì"* (though *"shì"* is incorrect—it should be *"rén"* (person) and *"kǒu"* (mouth), with *"bā"* symbolizing the breath issuing from above the mouth).
Thus, *"duì"* in the *Yijing* takes the mouth as its symbol.
To *"block the duì"* means to seal the mouth and not speak,
So that qi does not escape through the mouth.
The *"mén"* (nostrils) are the gate through which qi enters and exits.
One must first block the *duì* before closing the *mén*—
By not speaking and gradually regulating and reducing the breath until it ceases,
Thus the qi becomes concentrated within,
And one will never be exhausted by labor in their lifetime.

All people must speak to conduct affairs,
And daily opening the mouth to speak
Exhausts the qi until it is depleted—
In their lifetime, this cannot be remedied.

Seeing smallness as clarity,
Guarding softness as strength.
Smallness refers to the *"wēi"* (subtle) of the previous chapter—
What is seen is vague and indistinct,
Yet if one does not desire its clarity,
They will not overuse the spirit to harm the clarity,
But rather advance toward clarity each day.
What is held firm is fragile and weak,
Yet if one does not desire its strength,
They will not forcefully expend qi to harm strength,
But rather advance toward strength each day.

Seeing smallness is nurturing the child.
Guarding softness is guarding the mother.
*"Day"* may be a scribal error for *"or"* (as in *"either"*).

Using its light,
Returning to its clarity—
No harm comes to the body.
This is called *"clinging to constancy."*

This speaks of the method of nurturing the child:
A mirror’s ability to reflect is its light,
The essence of that light is its clarity.
Using the light that shines outward,
Returning it inward to illuminate within—
Restoring and returning it to its hidden essence.
The spirit, if overused, will be exhausted;
Seeing the depths of the fish is an omen of misfortune—
This is using light externally to bring harm to the body.
If one contains the light and blends with the world,
There will be no harm.
This is called *"clinging to constancy"*—
The ability to conceal the ordinary use of light
And return to the ordinary essence of clarity.

---
**Chapter 44**
The previous chapter spoke of *Dao* and *virtue/power* in all things.
This chapter speaks of *Dao* and *virtue/power* within a single human body.

If I—suddenly aware—
Were to walk the Great Dao,
I would fear only *excessive display*.

*"I"* refers generally to all people, not Laozi himself.
*"Suddenly aware"* (*jièrán*)—same usage as in *Mencius*, meaning a fleeting moment.
The word *"know"* is abruptly cut off.
*"Excessive display"* (*shī*)—akin to *"wúshīláo"* in the *Analects* and *"shīshī"* in *Mencius*, meaning boastful arrogance.
The Confucian disciple Yan Hui was *"as if without"* and *"as if empty"*—
Free from boastful arrogance.
Laozi’s teachings were likely of this nature,
For he most abhorred such display.

This chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao,
Who only seek boastful arrogance.
If such a person, in a fleeting moment, were to gain some knowledge
And wish to walk the Great Dao,
They would fear only *excessive display* and dare not act.

---
**Chapter 45**
The Great Dao is most level,
Yet people prefer narrow paths.

*Narrow paths* are small roads,
Opposite to the Great Dao.
The humble and retiring are the Great Dao—
Its way is level and easy to walk.
The boastful and arrogant are narrow paths—
Yet people love to tread them.

The court is excessively adorned,
The fields lie fallow,
The granaries are empty,
Yet they wear ornate robes and gird fine swords,
Rejecting food and drink,
Hoarding wealth in excess—
This is called *robber’s display*,
Not the Dao.

Within the hall, there is no wine or sweeping—
This is the frugality of the *Tang* and *Yin* winds.
If the court is excessively adorned, then the palaces must be extravagant.
Fallow fields and empty granaries mean seizing the people’s time so they cannot till or rest,
Exhausting their strength yet leaving them with no stores.
Wearing fine silks and jade as adornment,
Feasting on rich foods and meats as nourishment,
Filling private treasuries as wealth—
This is like a thief who, having stolen much,
Displays it arrogantly abroad.
The tyrants Jia of Xia, Jie of Yin, and Zhou of Shang were such—
How could one who knows the Dao do this?

---
A well-built foundation cannot be uprooted,
A well-embraced object cannot slip away.
Their descendants will never cease in sacrifice.

Plant a single tree upon the level earth,
There will surely come a time when it is uprooted and toppled.
Hold an object within both hands,
There will surely come a day when it slips and departs.

The skilled in building regard what is not built as building—
Then it will never be uprooted.
The skilled in embracing regard what is not embraced as embracing—
Then it will never slip away.

So too for those skilled in preserving the state and extending its lineage:
Without intent to retain the Mandate of Heaven, the Mandate of Heaven remains of itself.
Thus, their descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing,
As do those skilled in building and embracing.

When cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true.
Speaking to the preceding text,
Only by cultivating virtue in the self can one ensure descendants’ unceasing sacrifices.

Cultivating virtue in the self is the fulfillment of our true Dao.
All beyond the self are transient things—
Who would act for the sake of acting?

When virtue is cultivated in the self,
The effects of cause and response unfold naturally, beyond expectation,
And the state is preserved, its lineage extended—
Yet this is not by my own desire.

Cultivated in the family, its virtue becomes abundant;
Cultivated in the village, its virtue becomes enduring;
Cultivated in the realm, its virtue becomes plentiful;
Cultivated in the world, its virtue becomes universal.

The true Dao governs the self,
Its overflow governs others.

The family is beyond the self, within the nine clans.
The village is beyond the family, within the village boundaries.
The realm is beyond the village, within the realm’s borders.
The world is beyond the realm, within the four seas.

Cultivating in family, village, realm, and world—
From near to far, each person cultivates their own virtue.

Yet is this taught to all?
I act without action, and the people transform of themselves;
I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.

Abundant virtue extends beyond the self’s overflow.
Enduring virtue extends beyond the family’s length.
Plentiful virtue extends beyond the village’s breadth.
Universal virtue encompasses the realm’s full reach.

The realm—ancient texts read *guó*—
According to the *Shijing*, "sequence used in the realm" places *guó* below.
Master Kong Yingda’s commentary cites *Laozi*: "Cultivate in the realm, virtue becomes plentiful."
This was changed to *guó* in Han to avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozu’s name.
During the early Tang, when book compilation was most active,
some pre-taboo versions remained.
Thus, observe the self through the self,
the family through the family,
the village through the village,
the realm through the realm,
the world through the world.

When virtue is cultivated in the self and extends to the world,
None are left uncultivated—
Yet this follows their natural course; I have no part in it.

Things return to their own nature,
Unbound, unattached.
Each finds their place, rests in their station,
All attaining their natural measure—
This is the Dao’s effortless governance,
Mind and trace both forgotten,
Unencumbered transcendence,
Like the skilled builder who builds nothing,
The skilled embrace who embraces nothing.

Master Shao said:
Observe the Dao through the Dao,
Nature through nature,
Mind through mind,
Self through self,
Things through things—
Even if one sought to harm, could it be done?

Master Shao’s words are indeed the *Laozi*’s intent.

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The five preceding statements are spoken together,
Yet only the last is taken to conclude them.

This—
The world.
Know the world through the world,
And so too the realm, village, family, and self—
Is it not the simplest, the easiest?

---
The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.
Those who harbor boundless virtue within
Are like a babe.

The previous chapter says:
"Concentrate the qi, achieve softness—
Can you be like an infant?"
Constant virtue never departs,
Returning to the infant’s state.

Mencius said:
"The noble person does not lose the heart of an infant."

Master Su said:
When *Laozi* compares virtue to an infant,
He speaks of its essence before its function.

Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not strike.

Poisonous creatures—bees, wasps, and their kind—
Sting with their tail’s venom.
Fierce beasts—tigers, leopards, and their kind—
Grasp with claw and foot.
Raptors—hawks and falcons, and their kind—
Snatch with wing and talon.

Master Dong Si said:
The complete person harms no thing.

Master Su said:
The person without contrivance opposes none—
how could they be harmed?
Bones weak, sinews soft yet grip firm,
unaware of male and female union yet aroused—
this is the utmost of *jing*.
All day crying yet throat unstrained—
this is the utmost of harmony.

*Yin* (赤子阴), the infant’s cry—*hao*—
*hao*, weeping; *gē*—
*gē*, voice hoarse.
Form not yet complete yet *qi* already concentrated,
emotion not yet stirred yet *qi* already responsive—
this is the extreme of pure, unified *jing-qi*.
Voice long-enduring yet *qi* unharmed—
this is the extreme of balanced, moderate *he-qi*.

The infant, though called "child," is beyond duality.
*Gē*—what astonishes—
knowing harmony is constancy,
knowing constancy is clarity.
Humans who grasp the infant’s untrammled *qi* as constancy—
this is the clarity of Heaven’s true nature.

*Yìshēng* (益生) is *xiáng*—
*xiáng*, omen—unnatural *qi* of Heaven and Earth is *xiáng*.
Unable to match the infant’s pure *qi*,
they rely on form to bolster *qi*—
this is the phantom body of external nourishment,
not the true *qi*.
They move *qi* by emotion—
this is the false strength of contrived desire.
All things flourish then decay—
this is called *not-Dao*,
and *not-Dao* perishes early.
Relying on form to bolster—
this is the flourishing of form.
Moving by emotion—
this is the flourishing of emotion.
All things flourish then decay—
this is failing to attain constancy.
Failing to attain the Way,
they perish early and cannot endure.
Constant as the infant, how could they flourish?
How could they decay?
If they do not decay, how could they perish?

---
**Chapter 47**
The wise do not speak;
speakers lack wisdom.
Block the *dui* (口),
shut the gate—
this is loving life, preserving *self*.
Wasting *qi* through speech—
this is ignorance of the Way.
Those who know the Way do not speak;
they first block the source of speech—*dui*—
then seal the gate of *qi*.
Dull the sharp,
resolve the tangled,
soften the bright,
align with dust—
this is called *Xuan-Tong* (玄同).
This is interacting with the world.
First dull your own sharpness,
so as not to sharpen others’ tangles;
first dim your own brightness,
so as not to contrast with others’ obscurity.
In self and others, no distinction between sharp/dull, bright/dark—
harmonizing with the world, unfathomable—
thus called *Xuan-Tong*.
Unapproachable yet not distant,
unprofitable yet not harmful,
unexalted yet not lowly—
thus most noble under Heaven.
If I am *Xuan-Tong*,
none can draw near or distance me,
benefit or harm me,
elevate or debase me.
Grace though like kin,
yet people forget me—
unapproachable.
Distant as a passerby,
yet none dare abandon me—
not distant.
Beyond titles, wealth, or power,
yet none can aid me—
unprofitable.
Beyond life, death, calamity, or fortune,
yet none can harm me—
unharmful.
Though in authority like a sovereign,
people treat me familiarly—
unexalted.
Insignificant as a commoner,
yet none dare slight me—
not lowly.
These six—
what others cannot do,
I alone achieve—
thus most noble under Heaven.

---
**Chapter 48**
Govern with *zhèng* (正), wage war with *qí* (奇),
conquer the world with *wu-shì* (无事).
*Zhèng*—laws and prohibitions rectify the crooked.
Gan Jiang governed with *zhèng*,
but the Sage-Kings rooted governance in self-cultivation and familial harmony,
not relying on laws and prohibitions for rectitude.
*Qí*—stratagem, deceit, and guile—unnatural.
Sun Wu waged war with *qí*,
but the Sage-Kings’ heart was to comfort the people and punish wrong,
not valuing stratagem and deceit as *qí*.
*Qí* may be used in war,
but not to govern;
*Zhèng* may govern,
but not conquer the world.
*Wu-shì*—the Three Sovereigns’ effortless rule,
like Heaven’s silent motion yet seasons proceed,
all things born—
without demanding compliance,
yet none fail to comply—
thus only *wu-shì* can conquer the world.

How do I know this?
*[Setting forth the question to introduce the answer below.]*
*Zhèng* can govern,
*wu-shì* can conquer—
how do I know this is so?

The more taboos a land has,
the poorer its people.
The more useful tools a people have,
the more the state grows dim.
The more skilled artisans there are,
the more strange artifacts arise.
The more laws are promulgated,
the more thieves appear.

*[Answering the prior claim that zhèng can only govern.]*
Taboos—fear and prohibition, strict controls,
intended to rectify morals—
yet at every step or turn,
one risks transgression,
living in dread,
unable to thrive,
thus impoverished.
Useful tools—nets, plows, pestles, mortars, boats, carts—
intended to benefit the people—
yet without centralized measurement or standardization,
the state grows dull and indistinct.
Artisans—crafting tools, myriad trades competing for profit—
thus arise those selling false or novel wares.
Laws—what the people fear,
flaunted yet easy to break,
driving them to despair,
thus many turn to banditry.

The eight lines speak of two causes:
excessive laws breed taboos,
excessive skill breeds tools,
thieves arise from poverty,
strange artifacts from the state’s dimness.

The Sage governs through clarity of administration,
so the people know to fear and avoid transgression,
and the myriad artisans gather,
ensuring the people’s wealth and sustenance—
this is what is meant by *zhèng* [rectification].

*Zhèng* rectifies through *zhèng* [rectification],
for the hope is a well-ordered state.
Yet when the people below grow impoverished,
some become thieves and bandits,
while corrupt governance above breeds strange wares—
such are the consequences.
Thus, even in governing a state,
this approach remains insufficient.

Therefore, the Sage proclaims:
*"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love stillness, yet the people align with virtue;
I engage in no affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;
I harbor no desires, yet the people return to simplicity."*

This also answers the prior claim that *"without action, one can seize the realm."*
For *wuwei* [non-action], loving stillness, and lacking desire—
all are forms of *wu shì* [non-affairs].
Since there is nothing to attend to,
how could the people not naturally turn toward loyalty?
Thus, the people spontaneously transform,
spontaneously align with virtue,
spontaneously grow wealthy,
spontaneously return to simplicity—
such are the results.
Therefore, in seizing the realm,
this approach leaves abundance.

When governance is obscure and unobtrusive,
the people are pure and unspoiled;
when governance is sharp and scrutinizing,
the people grow cunning and depleted.

Misfortune, ah! Fortune leans upon it;
Fortune, ah! Misfortune lurks within it.
Who can know their ultimate end?

Summarizing the two preceding stanzas:
*Mùn-mùn* [obscure], not pleasing to the eye;
*Chún-chún* [pure], not tainted.
*Chá-chá* [sharp], precise and keen;
*Quē-quē* [depleted], never satisfied.

At the extreme of governance without affairs—
though *mùn-mùn* offers nothing to delight in,
yet the people spontaneously transform, align with virtue, grow wealthy, and return to simplicity—
and thus their purity is *chún-chún*.
Or governance that is *chá-chá*, with much to observe,
yet the people grow impoverished, the ruler grows benighted,
things become false, and the people disordered—
and thus their depletion is *quē-quē*.

Thus, I borrow misfortune and fortune as metaphors:
What men call misfortune—
they do not see that fortune leans upon its side,
like the *mùn-mùn* governance yielding *chún-chún* people.
What men call fortune—
they do not see that misfortune lurks within it,
like the *chá-chá* governance yielding *quē-quē* people.

Misfortune does not end in misfortune but ends in fortune;
fortune does not end in fortune but ends in misfortune.
Who can know where their end shall lie?

As for *zhèng* [rectitude],
I ask: when rectitude turns to its opposite,
the good turns to its opposite.
The people’s confusion has long been thus.

*Fù* [reverse], *shuò* [not good].
To govern with rectitude may be called good,
yet if the people are *quē-quē*,
then what use is rectitude to the ruler?

Rectitude opposes irregularity—
when rectitude reverses, it becomes the strange irregularity;
the good reverses, it becomes the *shuò* [not good].
Only when there is no rectitude to speak of,
no goodness to speak of,
does it not turn into the strange and the *shuò*.

Who can know this? Only the Sage, perhaps?
Common men have long been bewildered, unaware of this truth—
not since today, but for ages.
They know only that governing with rectitude is good,
yet they do not know that there is no rectitude to speak of as rectitude.

To take "no rectitude" as rectitude—
how does this differ from seizing the realm through non-action?

Thus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
sharp yet does not harm,
upright yet does not overreach,
bright yet does not dazzle.

Again, an illustration of *wu shì* [non-affairs]:
Square as a thing is square, with four sharp edges—
sharp as a hall’s eaves, with a single edge like a blade—
the harm of cutting is worse than that of harming.
The square has no flexibility, the sharp no distinction—
when encountering things, they must cause injury.
The upright cannot conceal or indulge in speech,
revealing others’ faults.
The bright cannot conceal themselves, flashing their virtues.

The Sage’s *wu shì* governance—
to act without acting is to act.
The square must cut, yet to be square without cutting is not to cut;
the sharp must harm, yet to be sharp without harming is not to harm;
the upright must overreach, yet to be upright without overreaching is not to overreach;
the bright must dazzle, yet to be bright without dazzling is not to dazzle.

Square yet not cutting, sharp yet not harming,
upright yet not overreaching, bright yet not dazzling—
all are metaphors for *wu shì*.

**Chapter 50: On Frugality and the Dao of Longevity**

To govern humanity and harmonize with Heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.

The form shaped by humanity,
the qi received from Heaven—
govern and cultivate them,
nourish and preserve them.

Frugality means
not lightly expending what is taken in,
not excessively consuming what is used—
a vital method to preserve form and spare qi.

Only through frugality
does one return early.

This early return is called *heavy accumulation of virtue*.
Heavy accumulation of virtue means
nothing cannot be overcome;
nothing cannot be overcome means
its limits are unknown;
its limits unknown means
one can possess a realm.

*Return* means to revert to its origin.
*Heavy* means abundant.
*Accumulation* means to store and gather within.
*Virtue* is the primordial qi received from Heaven.
*Overcome* means to conquer.
*Limits* means ultimate exhaustion.
*Possess* means to safeguard.
A realm is used to analogize the human body.

To be frugal in using qi,
the damaged become whole,
the declining flourish,
and one early attains the return to origin.
The accumulated primordial qi stored within
increases without decrease.

When qi is full and replete,
it can conquer external things,
and none can deplete or harm it.
Qi’s generation and flourishing never cease,
its ultimate exhaustion unknown—
unlike the common person’s qi,
which ages, declines, and is exhausted until ultimate exhaustion.

Qi without ultimate exhaustion
can safeguard the body,
and the form lingers long in the world.

The mother of possessing a realm,
this is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,
longevity and enduring vision.

The earlier text spoke of preserving the body’s form through accumulated virtue.
Virtue is the mother of all things’ forms.
To possess the body’s form
is to possess the mother of the body’s form,
thus it can endure.

Qi is the mother of the body’s form;
qi can preserve form,
and form can preserve qi.

Qi generated from below,
like a tree’s roots—
nourishing form to cultivate roots makes them deep and unplucked;
qi flourishing above,
like a fruit’s stem—
nourishing form to nourish the stem makes it firm and unsevered.

Roots unplucked, the tree never withers;
stems unsevered, the fruit never falls.
This is why the body attains longevity,
the eyes endure long vision,
and one transcends the world without dying.

Deep roots and firm stems—
the form’s preservation of qi;
longevity and enduring vision—
the form’s preservation of qi.

**Chapter 51**
To govern a great state,
as one poaches a small fish.
A small fish—small indeed.
A great state has many people;
to govern it, one must be simple and tranquil,
never disturbing the people,
like poaching a small fish—
lest it spoil, one dares not stir it.

He who rules the world by the Dao,
his spirits are not numinous.
*Numinous*—spirits of heaven and earth.
*Ghosts*—the qi of heaven and earth.
*Numinous*—the strange and uncanny.
When human qi aligns with heaven and earth’s qi as one,
a sage-ruler governs by the Dao,
simple and tranquil, undisturbing the people,
so the people’s qi harmonizes,
filling the space between heaven and earth,
responding in kind—
heaven and earth’s qi never clash or harm.
Thus, ghosts do not become numinous and bring calamity.

It is not that their spirits are not numinous,
but that their numinousness does not harm people.
It is not that their numinousness does not harm people,
but that the Sage does not harm them either.
Ghosts and spirits are but names for heaven and earth’s qi—
two names, one reality.
When neither harms the other,
virtue returns to its source.

*Return*—both.
Heaven and earth’s qi do not harm people
because the Sage does not harm heaven and earth’s qi.
The Sage does not harm heaven and earth’s qi
because he is simple and tranquil, and the people’s qi is harmonious.
Both unharmed—
this arises from the Sage’s virtue,
so both return virtue to the Sage.

---

**Chapter 52**
A great state is the confluence of the world,
the gathering place of all.
*Gathering*—meeting.
A great state is where small states converge,
like water’s downward flow,
the meeting of all waters beneath heaven.

The world’s female.
The female ever overcomes the male by stillness,
by taking the low.
The female does not move first to seek the male;
the male ever moves first to seek the female.
The active seeker invites loss;
the still awaiter gains benefit—
thus, *stillness overcomes the male*.
The active seeker is above;
the still awaiter is below—
thus, *stillness is the low*.

Some say the *female* may be a redundant character.

Thus, when a great state yields to small states,
it takes from them;
when small states yield to great states,
they take from them.
*Yielding to take*—the great state yields to take the small’s attachment;
*yielding while taking*—the small state yields to take the great’s favor.

The great state seeks only to encompass and nourish others;
the small state seeks only to serve others.
Both obtain what they desire—
the greater should thus be the lower.

The great state yields to the small,
desiring only to encompass and nourish them.
The small state yields to the great,
desiring only to serve them.
Both can yield—
then great and small each obtain their desire.
Yet the small is already beneath others,
and fears not its inability to yield;
the great is not beneath others,
and may fear its inability to yield—
thus, *the greater should be the lower*.

The metaphor of *downward flow* illustrates the great state,
though not beneath others, yet yielding;
the metaphor of *female and male* illustrates the small state,
already beneath others, yet yielding.

**Chapter 53**
The Dao is the hidden core of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of the unvirtuous.
*The hidden core*—the most precious of all things.
*Hidden*—the southwest corner of a hall.
In ancestral temple architecture,
there is the hall and the inner chamber;
the chamber is within, thus most honored.
Within the chamber,
the southeast corner is *yǎo*,
the northeast *yuàn*,
the northwest *wūlòu*.
*The hidden*—where the honored reside,
thus most precious.
The Dao’s nobility is like the hidden chamber of halls and temples.

*A treasure*—what people value.
The virtuous advance by the Dao,
gaining esteem from others.
The unvirtuous turn to the Dao,
repenting to preserve themselves.

*Yǎo*—pronounced *yǎo* (as in *yǎo* 杳).
*Yuàn*—pronounced *yuàn* (as in *yuàn* 颐).

Beautiful speech can be sold;
noble conduct can elevate others.
Elaborating on the virtuous’ treasure.
The virtuous gain esteem by the Dao—
lovely words are cherished, like fine goods sold in market;
exalted deeds are revered, surpassing others.

For the unvirtuous, what cause is there to abandon it?
Elaborating on the unvirtuous’ refuge.
The unvirtuous preserve themselves by the Dao—
fearing punishment, few in guilt,
their bodies whole and secure.
Thus, even the unvirtuous—
how could the Dao ever abandon them?

Therefore, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,
even with a jade tablet and four horses led first,
it is not as good as quietly presenting this Dao.

Elaborating on the Dao as the profound essence of all things.
Those who embody the Dao are entrusted by Heaven with the positions of sovereign and teacher—
then they are established as the Son of Heaven;
commanded by the sovereign with the duties of mentor—
then they are appointed as the Three Ministers,
all because they possess the Dao and are thus honored.

*Scholar’s Note:*
*Schùnbì*—a jade tablet curved like an embrace.
*Sìmǎ*—four horses harnessed as one team.
The precedence of *schùnbì* over *sìmǎ* is akin to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ account of riding in a *wéi* carriage before twelve oxen.

*Sitting*—here, kneeling.

At ceremonial feasts, four horses are arrayed outside,
and the bearer of the *schùnbì* leads the mission, declaring, *“First, the morning tribute.”*

Though the *schùnbì* and four horses are deemed the utmost honor,
they are not as precious as kneeling to present this Dao.
The nobility of the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers
lies in this Dao—
the *schùnbì* and four horses pale in comparison.
Thus, all things hold it in highest regard as their profound mystery.

Why, then, is this Dao so revered from antiquity?
Is it not because one who seeks thereby obtains,
and one who errs thereby is absolved?
Hence, it is cherished by all under Heaven.

*Summarizing the three preceding sections:*
The Dao is the profound essence of all things—
seeking thereby obtains speaks to the virtuous’ treasure,
and erring thereby is absolved speaks to the unvirtuous’ refuge.

Why has this Dao been held in such esteem since ancient times?
Is it not because the virtuous, through this Dao, are treasured by others and fulfill their desires?
Is it not because the unvirtuous, through this Dao, preserve themselves and avoid guilt?
Thus, the Dao is the supreme treasure of all under Heaven.

*Chapter 53:*
To act without doing,
to manage without meddling,
to savor without taste—
all are the essence of *wuwei*.
The core tenets of the Laozi are thus expounded:
In conduct, to regard *wu-shì* as *shì*;
In sustenance, to regard *wu-wèi* as *wèi*—
all unfolding the meaning of *wuwei* in a single phrase.

To plot difficulties in their ease,
to forge greatness in their smallness.
Great undertakings under Heaven must begin in simplicity,
and mighty deeds must arise from the minute.
*Zuò*—to initiate.

Thus, one attains *wuwei* by planning when things are easy,
and acting when they are small.
All things under Heaven begin easy yet end difficult,
begin small yet end vast—
their final difficulty stems from initial ease,
their final grandeur from initial triviality.
Hence, if one acts when they are still easy and small,
their end will not reach difficulty,
and they will effortlessly attain greatness,
without toil of heart or strength—
thus achieving *wuwei*.

If one does not plan early,
but instead acts urgently when things are already begun,
then what was once easy grows difficult,
what was once small fails to expand—
heart and strength are exhausted,
and *wuwei* becomes unattainable.

To hold steady what is stable,
to plan before signs appear,
to mend what is fragile before it shatters,
to disperse what is subtle before it scatters—
to act before existence,
to govern before chaos.
This speaks to planning in their ease.

The tree that bears fruit begins as a tender shoot;
the nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;
a thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.
This speaks to acting in their smallness.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many easies breed many difficulties.
Thus, even the Sage finds difficulty in them,
and so remains without difficulty.

*Above:* the ease or difficulty of undertakings.
*Here:* the ease or difficulty of the heart.
Those who initially take vows lightly
will find it difficult to keep them at the end—
thus, few fulfillments.
Those who begin with many easies
will inevitably face many difficulties—
so even before reaching the end’s difficulty,
the heart already deems it hard.
Though the beginning was easy,
the heart still resists it—
easy at the start and hard at the end,
no vow is ever taken lightly,
and so there is no difficulty at the end.

Great or small, many or few—
repaying grudges with virtue.
Thus, the Sage never claims greatness,
and so achieves true greatness.

*Above:* the greatness or smallness of undertakings.
*Here:* the greatness or smallness of the heart.
Though one may be great,
the heart remains humble;
though one may be many,
the heart remains few.
Though there are grudges to repay,
one does not rely on one’s greatness or multitude,
nor rush to assert justice and retaliate—
instead, one humbles oneself as small and few,
bearing insults and repaying with virtue.
For when one is initially small and few,
the heart does not dare assume greatness,
and when one is finally great and many,
the heart still does not dare assume greatness—
consistently self-effacing,
thus achieving true greatness.

The people’s pursuits often falter as they near completion.
To guard the end as the beginning,
then there will be no failed undertakings.

*Further elaborating on the two instances of “end” above:*
Though one may have deemed it difficult at the start,
by the end, it is no longer difficult;
though one may have dared not claim greatness at the start,
by the end, one assumes greatness—
then undertakings near completion often fail at the end.
Thus, one must guard the end as the beginning—
difficult at the start and difficult at the end,
not great at the start and not great at the end—
then there will be no failed undertakings.

To act is to court failure;
to grasp is to court loss.
Without action, there is no failure;
without grasping, there is no loss.

*Further elaborating on the two instances of “failure” above:*
Those who fix their hearts on doing will sometimes undo their success;
those who fix their hearts on holding will sometimes lose what they grasp.
Without doing, there is no success or failure;
without grasping, there is no gain or loss.

Thus, the Sage desires without desiring,
does not prize hard-to-obtain goods;
learns without learning,
reverses the errors of the common folk,
assisting the natural unfolding of all things
without daring to act.

The multitude pursues what I do not pursue;
the multitude scorns and passes by, yet I return to their path—
this is not learning what others learn,
hence it is said: *"learn without learning."*

All these who do not desire learning
do so because the Way of all things is *wuwei* and unfolds naturally.
Thus, I too act with *wuwei* and align with the natural unity of all things,
as spokes depend on the hub to form one.

The chapter begins with *"wuwei"* and ends with *"natural without daring to act"*—
its meaning is consistent from start to finish.

---
**Chapter 54**
The ancients who excelled in the Dao did not enlighten the people;
they sought to make them ignorant instead.
To have knowledge is enlightenment;
to lack knowledge is ignorance.

The ancients cultivated their own virtue to enlighten the people’s virtue,
yet they also wished that those who were ignorant might progress to enlightenment.
It is not that they did not desire enlightenment for the people,
but that they could not make them know—
not that they wished them to remain ignorant.

Laozi was born in a declining age.
He saw that in ancient times, governance was through *wuwei*,
and the people were pure and simple, yet unknowing.
In later times, governance was through action,
and the people became deceitful and knowing.

Those who excel in the Dao transform the people into purity and simplicity,
not to make them knowing,
but to make them ignorant.

This is a critique of the times, correcting perversity—
yet its excess led to Qin’s burning of the classics
to keep the common people ignorant.

The difficulty of governing lies in their intelligence.
Thus, ruling with intelligence is a state’s ruin;
ruling without intelligence is a state’s blessing.

The reason the people are difficult to govern
is that their knowledge is excessive—
laws are made, yet deceit arises;
orders are given, yet trickery follows.

Ruling with intelligence means governing with cunning and wisdom,
forcing the people to also become intelligent—
then they become crafty and difficult to govern.
Ruling with intelligence is the state’s harm.

Ruling without intelligence means dimming one’s own brilliance to lead the people,
so that they also become ignorant and simple—
then they are docile and easy to govern.
Ruling without intelligence is the state’s blessing.

To know these two methods is to grasp the standard.
The two methods are: ruling with intelligence and ruling without intelligence.
*Kai* means to take as a model for imitation;
*shi* means to place oneself in humility.

For one who rides in a carriage,
to straighten the back and lean on the rail is to place oneself in high status,
but to bow the head and lean on the crossbar is to place oneself in humility.

Not placing oneself in intelligence but in ignorance—
this is to be humble rather than exalted.

To know the standard and model is called *Xuande* (Mysterious Virtue).
Mysterious Virtue is profound, distant,
contrary to all things,
yet reaches the utmost harmony.

Those who know to imitate the Sage’s humility
possess a mysterious and wondrous virtue—
profound and distant, beyond ordinary measure.
Thus, people cannot fathom it.

All desire intelligence, yet I alone desire ignorance—
this is contrary to all things.
Contrary means opposition;
not contrary means conformity.

Though contrary, it is not disorder—
it is the greatest conformity.
Thus, it is the profound, distant, unfathomable virtue.

---
**Chapter 55**
The reason rivers and seas can be sovereign over all streams
is that they excel in descending.
Thus, they become sovereign over all streams.

All streams’ waters converge in rivers and seas,
just as all under heaven’s people converge to one ruler.
Rivers and seas are low in elevation,
able to descend to all waters,
thus they receive all streams and become sovereign.

The ruler’s ability to encompass all under heaven’s people
is likewise so.

Thus, the Sage desires to be above others
by speaking humbly;
desires to lead others
by placing himself behind.

To speak humbly is to lower and bend one’s words without arrogance.
To place oneself behind is to retreat without advancing.

This is the Sage’s supreme virtue of modesty and yielding—
not from a deliberate desire to be above or lead others.
The reader must not take the words to harm the meaning.

Thus, when in a high position, others do not find it burdensome;
when in the forefront, others do not find it harmful.
*Heavy* means difficult;
*Harm* means calamity.

The Sage, after descending and retreating,
when placed above others, is not found burdensome;
when placed before others, is not found harmful.
Thus, all under heaven willingly promote him without exhaustion.

Because he does not contend,
none can contend with him.
All under heaven willingly acclaim him,
yet he does not weary of being placed above or before others—
for his humility and retreat,
no one can contend with him for supremacy or precedence.
Thus, the Sage attains position and timing,
ultimately achieving to be above and lead others.

Dong Zhongshu said:
*"Virtue descending makes form ascend;
virtue retreating makes form advance."*

Yang Xiong said:
*"He who places himself low is exalted by others;
he who places himself behind is honored first."*

---
**Chapter 56**
All under heaven say my Dao is vast, yet seems unworthy.
Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy, it would have been so for long—
then it would be small.

Unworthy means lacking resemblance,
doubtful as if possessing no ability at all.
The vast Dao seems unworthy,
like the commoners of the alleys calling Confucius "vast yet without a single virtue."

Only because it is vast and beyond naming
does it seem unworthy, with nothing to commend it.

Dong Zhongshu said:
*"If it resembles something, it is confined to one thing—
how can it be vast?"*

I possess three treasures, which I hold fast:
First, *ci* (compassion);
Second, *jian* (frugality);
Third, *not daring to lead all under heaven.*

To *hold* means to guard without loss.
*Ci* is gentle, weak, and merciful, not rigid.
*Jian* is sparse, modest, and thrifty, not extravagant.
*Not daring to lead* is yielding and retreating, not aggressive.

By holding fast to these three treasures,
even vastness seems unworthy.

For *ci* (compassion) brings courage;
*jian* (frugality) brings breadth;
not daring to lead all under heaven brings mastery.

Now abandon *ci* for courage,
abandon *jian* for breadth,
abandon yielding for leading—
then death is certain.

The compassionate seem cowardly yet are truly courageous;
the frugal seem narrow yet are truly expansive.
A vessel’s form is fixed—its length is its excellence—
yet one who does not lead is not its master.
But by yielding to others’ precedence,
one surpasses all things and becomes the vessel’s master.

To discard *ci*, *jian*, and retreat for the treasures of rigidity, extravagance, and aggression—
this is the path of those who court death.

For *ci* in battle brings victory,
in defense brings steadfastness.
When Heaven means to save, it does so with *ci* as its shield.
*Ci* is the Dao of life,
the virtue of the seven generations,
the first of the three treasures.
Here, we speak solely of *ci* as treasure—
yet the other two are contained within it.

The compassionate are cherished by all as parents—
who would have a child attack their own parents?
Thus, to wage war or defend with *ci* is to ensure none dare oppose or assault,
for none can bear to harm what they hold dear.
Even if enemies come to fight and attack,
many will aid as if defending their own kin—
and victory and steadfastness shall follow.
Should human strength fail, Heaven itself will aid,
preventing defeat or rout.
Heaven aids because they are shielded by *ci*.

Cao Cao and Fu Jian devoured without restraint—
their lack of *ci* was extreme.
Though Wu and Jin were not as saintly in their compassion,
they resisted invasion only when forced,
yet compared to Cao and Fu, their actions were nearer to *ci*.
At the Red Cliffs, the wind and fire favored the south, destroying northern ships;
at Qinggang, the wind and crane’s cry caused the enemy to flee—
though weak, Wu and Jin repelled armies of a hundred thousand.
This too was Heaven’s salvation.

The skilled warrior is not martial,
the skilled fighter does not rage,
the skilled victor does not engage,
the skilled leader serves below.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
the strength of using others,
harmonizing with Heaven—
the ultimate of antiquity.

Now further expounding the treasure of *ci*:
Four sentences, four *shàn* (excellences),
three on warfare, one on leadership.

In ancient times, chariot warfare was the norm.
Three armored soldiers rode each chariot—
one arching left, one spearing right,
the driver wielding flag and drum,
all singing of strength and might.
Seventy-two foot soldiers served beneath,
and before battle, they were roused to fury,
urged to rage and contend for victory.

But the compassionate do not prize such strength in warriors,
nor rage in battle,
nor await confrontation to triumph.
No blades are drawn—
the enemy yields on its own.
Though my wisdom surpasses others,
I appear unwise;
though I have ability,
I appear inept.
I place myself below,
using others’ wisdom as my own,
their strength as my own.
Without martial fury, without rage, without confrontation,
I triumph through non-contention,
as Heaven triumphs without contending.

To serve below means
not relying on one’s own wisdom and strength,
but using others’ power to accomplish one’s ends—
as Heaven acts without action yet achieves all.
Thus it is said: *harmonizing with Heaven*.

Only the most ancient sages reached such heights—
hence, the ultimate of antiquity.

There is a saying of warfare:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the responder,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."*
This is called:
*having no march yet marching,*
*having no arm yet warding,*
*having no weapon yet conquering,*
*having no enemy yet subduing.*

Again expounding the treasure of *ci*.
The phrase *"I dare not"* speaks to warfare.
Those who wage war have said these words.

To be the aggressor is to initiate conflict against others.
To be the responder is to meet force only when compelled.
To advance an inch is difficult;
to retreat a foot is easy.
*Rén* (就) means to approach.

Though one may be the aggressor, one is truly a responder;
though a responder, one does not wish to fight,
daring not to advance, preferring to retreat far.
The advancing warrior marshals his ranks and moves forward,
bends his arm to wield his weapon,
and presses onward to confront the enemy.
If he does not march, though he has ranks, it is as if he has none;
if he does not bend his arm, though he has arms, it is as if he has none;
if he does not wield his weapon, though he has weapons, it is as if he has none;
if he does not confront, though enemies stand before him, it is as if they are none.
*○* *Wúxíng* (无行) is pronounced *háng*.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits our treasure.
Thus, when armies clash,
the compassionate prevail.

Marching three armies into perilous battle,
one must tremble with fear,
daring not to underestimate the enemy.
To underestimate the enemy is to court battle lightly,
until killing becomes inevitable and our *ci* is lost—
no greater calamity exists.

Though not yet engaged in battle,
once the heart harbors underestimation,
the seeds of killing and forfeiture are already sown—
hence, *"nearly forfeits our treasure."*

*Kàng* (抗) means to raise.
The *āi* (哀) is the manifestation of compassion.
Su Shi said:
When two armies raise their forces in confrontation,
and I act only when compelled,
then pity for slaughter arises—
and with pity, Heaven and humanity aid in victory.

For the compassionate do not defeat the uncompassionate through battle,
but subdue them without fighting—
this is true victory.

---
*Chapter Fifty-Seven concludes here.*
My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.

The world cannot know, cannot practice.

Laozi teaches people to be soft, weak, humble, and lowly—
his words are very easy to know,
his deeds very easy to perform.
Yet as the age declines and customs degenerate,
no one in the world can recognize the worth of his words,
nor can they practice the softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness.

Words have a *zōng* (宗), deeds have a *jūn* (君).
For only the unknowing fail to recognize me.
The *zōng* is noble among clans and unites a clan,
the *jūn* is noble among states and rules a state.
Softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness
can be the standard for all words, like a clan’s *zōng*;
can be the master of all deeds, like a state’s *jūn*.

Laozi laments that people are foolish and unknowing,
thus they fail to recognize the worth of my words.
Few know me—
and so I am noble.

Thus the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade within.
He both laments and seems to rejoice—
not that he rejoices, but deeply laments.
For those who recognize the worth of my words are few,
and this is why my words are noble.
If all could know my words,
then I would be no different from the common crowd—
no longer noble.

*Pó* (褐) is coarse hemp cloth, worn by the lowly.
People do not recognize the Sage;
they see only his outer garment like *pó*, unworthy of honor,
unaware of the priceless jade within.

*Chapter Fifty-Eight concludes here.*
To know the unknowing—
this is the highest virtue.

To not know what one knows—this is sickness.
To know yet seem not to know—this is the Sage’s wisdom,
plunged in clarity and insight,
yet guarded by simplicity, thus called *supreme*.
To not know yet think one knows—this is the fool’s folly,
deaf and blind, yet boasting of what they hear and see,
thus called *sickness*.

Only by treating sickness as sickness
does one escape sickness.
To treat sickness as sickness is to regard one’s affliction as affliction,
and so to know sickness as sickness.
If one recognizes it as sickness and treats it as such,
then this sickness will no longer exist.
The Sage does not fall ill,
for he treats sickness as sickness,
and thus does not fall ill.

The Sage is born knowing—
though knowing, he seems not to know.
How could there be sickness in knowing what one knows?
His freedom from sickness is natural and effortless,
not achieved by treating sickness as sickness.

The Sage does not rely on innate knowledge,
though he himself has no sickness to treat.
Yet seeing the unvirtuous, he reflects inwardly,
and among the people’s treatable afflictions,
he is vigilant, regarding them as his own sickness,
for he treats others’ sickness as his own.
Thus, from beginning to end, he remains free of sickness.

---
*Chapter Fifty-Nine concludes here.*

When the people do not fear *威* (threat),
the greatest threat has arrived.

*威* is that which should be feared—
matters that shorten life and harm the body.
The greatest threat is death itself.
If people do not fear what should be feared,
they will harm their bodies and shorten their lives,
hurrying toward death—
and so the greatest threat has arrived.

Zhuangzi said:
What people should fear
lies in their daily routines, between meals,
yet they do not take warning.
Do not grow familiar with where you dwell,
do not reject what sustains you.

Do not neglect what is proper—
restrain your words.

*狎* (xiá) means to grow accustomed through familiarity.
*所居* is where the body abides.
*厌* is to loathe and discard.

In daily life, whatever harms the body and shortens life—
if one does not fear it, grows accustomed to it,
and acts carelessly, this is to not fear *威*.
To reject what sustains life is to hasten death—
this is to loathe what sustains you,
and so the greatest threat has arrived.

Only by not growing familiar
does one not reject.
*—Old texts read "not reject" where "not grow familiar" should be.*
The scholar Liu of Luling says:
The correct reading should be "not grow familiar" above.
I follow this.

Only by not growing familiar with where you dwell
and fearing what should be feared
does one not reject what sustains life,
and so the greatest threat does not arrive.

Thus the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,
loves himself without valuing himself excessively,
and so discards the former to embrace the latter.

*自知* is knowing the way to cherish life.
*自见* is displaying one’s knowledge to others.
*自贵* is the later chapter’s *noble life*—
the fault of clinging too desperately to life.

The Sage, though inwardly knowing the way to love himself,
conceals his virtue and follows the luminous Way,
knowing yet seeming not to know,
and does not parade his knowledge for others to see.
Though his love for himself is profound,
he embodies the Dao naturally,
as if life were not something to cling to,
and avoids the error of greedily valuing life.

The former—what he does not possess—
is what he discards.
The latter—what he does possess—
is what he takes.

**Chapter Sixty: The Bold and the Cautious**

The bold in daring bring death,
the bold in restraint bring life.
These two—one brings benefit, one brings harm.

This speaks of those whose strength exceeds others in enforcing law.
*"Daring"* means daring to do evil.
*"Not daring"* means not daring to do evil.

Suppose two men are both bound by law:
The one bold in daring harbors a heart for evil beyond others—
he is one who, relying on finality, transgresses deliberately.
Thus, he must be put to death.
The *Yu Dian* calls this *"the punishment for treachery,"*
the *Zhou Gao* calls it *"not a mistake,"*
for those who act with finality must indeed be killed. #2

The one bold in restraint harbors a heart against evil beyond others—
he is one who, by misfortune or error, transgresses.
Thus, he must be spared.
The *Yu Dian* says *"mistakes and disasters are pardoned,"*
the *Zhou Gao* says *"not finality,"*
for those who act in error must not be killed.

Punishment for deliberate crime, pardon for mistakes—
these are the twofold laws of the Sage-King.
But Laozi’s meaning is otherwise:
he says these two—one brings benefit, one brings harm.
Benefit lies in the bold who restrain and spare life,
harm lies in the bold who dare and kill—
lest they err in execution.
Thus, even the daring should not be killed,
while the restrained must surely live.

Who knows the will of Heaven?
Therefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.

The one who dares to do evil is indeed what Heaven abhors, yet Heaven’s abhorrence is profound and inscrutable—how can one know for certain that he is truly the one Heaven abhors? Though such a person may be killed, the Sage still hesitates, not daring to kill lightly.

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs, does not speak yet responds, does not summon yet comes of its own accord—open and yet ever-conspiring. The heavenly net is vast, wide yet never misses.

The Sage does not kill lightly, yet evil-doers all escape—yet the net of Heaven is unbroken. Heaven’s judgment of evil men is not like man’s forceful contention, yet Heaven’s decree naturally overcomes them. It does not speak like man’s words, yet its response is swift as echo to sound. Its retribution comes not by summoning but spontaneously—great evil meets great retribution, and even with clever schemes, none can escape. Though Heaven acts without intent, open and simple, its retribution is subtle and beyond mortal contrivance.

The net of Heaven is vast, broad as if sparse yet not lax—yet it never misses a single one. Evil men cannot slip through, though the Sage does not kill them, Heaven itself does.

If the people do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death? If you could make the people always fear death, then those who act strangely, I could seize and kill—who would dare? "Strange" means unorthodox. If you make the common people always harbor fear of death, then those who act strangely and wickedly, I could seize and kill them—then all would know to fear, and who would dare to do evil?

Yet even if you kill evil men, those who dare to do evil will not cease—then it is clear the people are ignorant and do not fear death. Though evil men must face punishment and death, they still fear no one above—how can you frighten them with death and yet kill them lightly? There are always those who execute.

If one substitutes for the executioner to kill, it is like substituting for the master carpenter to hew. If one substitutes for the master carpenter to hew, few will avoid injury to their hands. If you do not frighten men with death, can evil-doers be left unkilled? It is said: there are those who execute. Those who execute are Heaven. Only Heaven can kill men, only the master carpenter can hew wood. If men seek to substitute for Heaven in killing, it is like substituting for the carpenter in hewing. Those who substitute in hewing will surely injure their hands—so too, those who substitute in killing will surely harm themselves.

Without human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.

---
**Chapter 61 (in all, five sections):**
The first section speaks of the proper use of punishment, which cannot be fully followed—it reflects excessive pity and leniency.
The second section speaks of Heaven’s inscrutability and the caution against killing lightly.
The third section shows how Heaven can act as the executioner to teach.
The fourth section argues that the people cannot be coerced by fear and thus killing should not be light.
The fifth section warns against men presuming to substitute for Heaven in killing—great indeed is Laozi’s compassion.

The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—thus they hunger. "Food" refers to what the ruler takes from the people. "Tax" refers to what the people give to supply the ruler’s needs. If the ruler takes much from the people, the people will be hungry and poor.

The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act—thus they are difficult to govern. If the ruler acts with schemes and cunning to control the people, the people in turn will deceive the ruler with deceit—thus they are difficult to govern.

Men grow careless of death because they cling too much to life—thus they grow careless of death. Only those who do not cling to life are superior to those who prize it. "Light" means easy. "Clinging to life" means the heart is too set on living. "Superior" means surpassing. "Prizing life" is the same as clinging to life. If the heart is too set on living, if one over-preserves life, one may seek not to die yet instead make death easy.

The Perfect Man does not not love life—he follows its natural course, harbors no scheming heart, as if he does not cling to life. Yet he transcends his body while his body remains, surpassing those who labor their hearts to prize life and instead make death easy.

**Chapter 62:**
Man’s life is soft and weak, yet his death is hard and strong.
Grass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden.
In life, man’s flesh is soft and pliable, his movements flexible and yielding; in death, he grows cold and rigid, stiff and unyielding. Grass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden—thus speaking of man extends to grass and trees.

Therefore, the hard and strong belong to death, the soft and weak belong to life.
From the earlier text, man and grass and trees are soft in life yet hard in death—by this principle of things, one knows that in virtue and conduct, the hard and strong do not attain death, for they are of death’s kind, while the soft and weak preserve life, for they are of life’s kind.

Thus, strong armies do not conquer, strong trees are split.
In warfare, the weak demonstrate deep strategy and skill—the enemy, underestimating them, grows careless, and thus they win. Those who rely on strength are shallow in thought and arrogant—the enemy, fearing them, prepares against them, and thus they do not win.

The art of war begins like a maiden—showing weakness to the enemy by appearing open and vulnerable; later it flees like a hare—the enemy, unable to resist, is overcome. The Qin army passed through Zhou, their chariots leaping three hundred feet high, yet they were defeated at Zhaoyao. The Qi army invaded Jin, their soldiers hurling stones, yet they were defeated at [illegible].

This proves that relying on strength does not bring victory. "Split" means to be grasped by both hands. The weak, swaying branches are the small twigs near the ends, while the strong, unyielding ones are the great trunks near the roots—thus speaking of war extends to trees.

Therefore, the hard and strong are lowly, the soft and weak are exalted. From the earlier text, strong armies are overcome by others—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like those who conquer. Strong trees are the trunks near the roots—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like the small branches.

From this principle of nature, one understands that in human virtue and conduct, those who are firm and strong are proud of themselves and domineer over others, yet they will inevitably stumble and lose their exalted status, descending to a position beneath others. Those who are soft and weak, however, are revered and honored by all, thus attaining a position above others.

**Chapter 63: The Way of Heaven**
Is it not like the drawing of a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised;
The excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.
The first two lines speak of drawing a bow, the latter two of the Way of Heaven.

When a bow is slackened, its upper curve droops downward, its lower curve rises upward. When drawn taut, its upper curve lifts upward, its lower curve presses downward. Thus, the high (upper curve) is pressed down to the low, and the low (lower curve) is raised to the high. Heaven’s diminishing of excess is like pressing down the upper curve to lower it, and its supplementing of deficiency is like raising the lower curve to elevate it. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.

But the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Heaven’s Way takes from the full to benefit the humble, while humanity takes from the few to benefit the many, devours the small to benefit the great, seizes the poor to benefit the rich—this is how it defies the Way of Heaven.

Who then can use their excess to nourish the world?
Only the Daoist.

The Daoist ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven and wealthy with the Four Seas, does not claim ownership of his nobility or riches. He eats coarse food, wears rough garments, lives in humble dwellings, and spares no effort to conserve resources for the people, never wasting. He regulates the fields and teaches cultivation, lightens taxes, ensuring that families are well-provided and people are content. Thus, he uses his own excess to nourish the world.

Therefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it. Does he not wish to display his virtue?
The Sage’s abilities cover the world—this is excess. Yet he does not rely on his abilities as if they were his own, nor does he claim his accomplishments as if they were his own, nor does he wish to show his virtue as superior to others. All these are ways of diminishing his own excess.

**Chapter 64: The Soft and Weak Overcome the Hard and Strong**
Nothing in the world is as soft and weak as water, yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong. This is because there is nothing to replace it.
Though gold and stone are the hardest and strongest, grinding them still requires water. Thus, water is the foremost in attacking the hard and strong, and none can surpass it. Even if one wished to substitute another, there is no alternative.

The soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong—all know this, yet none can practice it.
Water is the most soft and weak, yet it can erode the hardest stone. This is how the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Though all know this, none can act in accordance with softness and weakness—it is deceptive.

Thus, the Sage says:
*"To bear a state’s filth is to be its guardian;
To bear a state’s misfortunes is to be its king."*
Filth refers to impurity.
Misfortune refers to what is unlucky and unvirtuous.
Impurity and misfortune are what people despise and hold in contempt, yet the Sage does not shun them. Even if an entire state heaps such shame upon him, he accepts it without complaint. For he is soft and weak, willingly enduring humiliation to avoid domination like the hard and strong who seek to exalt themselves over others. Yet the spirits are pleased and he can be the guardian of the state, while the people turn to him and he can rule the world.

The hard and strong provoke divine wrath and popular rebellion, losing their state and their world. The soft and weak receive divine favor and popular allegiance, gaining their state and their world.
This is the effect of the soft and weak overcoming the hard and strong.

**Chapter 65: Straight Speech Seems Paradoxical**
Laozi takes "reversal" as the movement of the Dao and the mystery of virtue, so even when speaking straightforwardly, it often seems contrary to the straightforward.

Straightforward yet seeming reversed—like being bright yet appearing dim, advancing yet seeming to retreat, being upright yet seeming crooked, being skillful yet seeming clumsy—all follow this pattern. For what appears dim is the means to brightness, what appears to retreat is the means to advance, what appears crooked is the means to straightness, what appears clumsy is the means to skill, and what appears reversed is the means to the straight.

The following text states: *"To reconcile deep grudges, one must have excess grudges—how then can it be considered good?"*
Reconcile means to pacify.
Grudge refers to resentment toward another.
Deep grudge means the resentment is profound.
Excess grudge means the resentment lingers unresolved within, like when the Master acted for the Duke of Wei—this is akin to aiding.
Good refers to the virtuous person.

When two parties hold grudges, they must be reconciled to resolve them. Two virtuous people naturally have no grudges, so why reconcile? Two wicked people, if they hold grudges, will either exhaust their evil and destroy each other, or one will triumph while the other is defeated, or both will be harmed. An outsider may merely observe in silence.

Only when a virtuous person, through misfortune, holds a grudge against a wicked one does the situation arise. Though the virtuous person is forgiving and has no ill will, the wicked one is vengeful and will surely act against the virtuous. If the wicked one retaliates, the virtuous will suffer.

Thus, those who sincerely wish to aid the virtuous must reconcile the grudge, easing the resentment and releasing the hatred, intending to benefit the virtuous. Yet by blocking the wicked one’s vengeful heart, preventing its fulfillment, the unresolved resentment lingers within. Though it may seem reconciled today, it will erupt violently later. How then can such reconciliation truly benefit the virtuous?

The Sage holds the left contract and does not demand repayment from others. To hold the left contract and not demand repayment is to act without scheming against things.

A *contract* (契) is a wooden tally split in two, each party keeping one half as a pledge of trust. To *demand repayment* (责) means to claim goods or debts from another. The contract has left and right halves: the left is kept by the owner of the goods, while the right is given to the one who comes to claim them. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记》) states that the right contract is used to demand repayment, and the *Book of Rites* (《礼记》) says that those offering land or houses hold the right contract—thus, the left contract is the proof held by the one who receives repayment.

To hold the left contract means one does not demand repayment from others but waits for others to demand from oneself. If someone comes with the right contract to claim, one gives it without calculating whether the person is virtuous or wicked.

Those who reconcile grudges act with intent to aid the virtuous, whereas the Sage acts without scheming, like one who holds the left contract and does not demand repayment—calmly observing things and letting them unfold naturally.

The virtuous manage contracts; the unvirtuous manage *simplicity* (彻). The virtuous act without scheming; the unvirtuous act with scheming. *Simplicity* (彻) means *universal harmony* (通).

In ancient times, the *assistance law* (助法) divided a well-field into nine sections: eight families each received one private section, while one section was public land, farmed collectively by the eight families. Each family’s private yield of a hundred *mu* could feed nine, eight, seven, six, or as few as five, depending on their strength and labor.

The Zhou dynasty replaced this with the *simplicity law* (彻法), fearing the private yields were uneven. Thus, the eight families’ private fields were also farmed collectively, ensuring equal distribution—no more excess or deficiency. Those who hold the left contract allow others to take without scheming, hence it is said the virtuous manage *simplicity*. Law arises from fear of inequality, scheming over fairness, hence it is said the unvirtuous manage it.

Those who reconcile grudges fear the virtuous will suffer, acting with intent to aid them—like the unvirtuous managing *simplicity* for the weakest family, fearing their share will be meager.

The Dao of Heaven favors none; it always aids the virtuous. *With* (与) here means *acts for*. The Sage, without scheming for the virtuous, yet Heaven acts for them, ensuring the wicked cannot act with malice.

Earlier, it was said the Sage does not use punishment, yet Heaven slays the wicked. Here, it is said the Sage does not reconcile grudges, yet Heaven aids the virtuous. The Way of Laozi is *wuwei*—natural and entrusted to Heaven.

Yet Heaven’s destruction of the wicked and aid to the virtuous—how can it compare to human scheming? The wicked must meet calamity; the virtuous must receive blessing. Such is the natural order.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**

In small states with few people,
Let the people have ten- or hundred-fold implements but not use them,
Let the people value death but not flee far away.

*Ten* (什) is ten people; *hundred* (伯) is a hundred. *Ten- or hundred-fold implements* are heavy, large tools, shared by all. *Not use* means not to labor for them, not to covet them—thus, heavy tools have no purpose.

*Value death* means to regard death as a grave matter and cherish life. *Not flee far away* means to be born here and die here, not wandering elsewhere.

Laozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Large states mean many people, difficult to govern; thus, he advocated small states with few people, ensuring the people do not covet the outside and are self-sufficient within.

Though there are boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them;
Though there are armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.

Boats and carriages, armor and weapons—these are not things one person can use alone; they are the implements of *ten* and *hundred*. To have no need to ride them, to have no need to display them, is to not use them at all.

If there is nowhere to go, then boats and carriages are of no use;
If there is nothing to contend over, then armor and weapons are of no use.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.

When the people are pure and affairs are simple, the ancient governance of knotted cords can be restored. Though writing and contracts exist, they too may be unused—it is not merely the implements of *ten* and *hundred* that are set aside.

Let them find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful.
This is to value death and not wander far.
To call the food one eats sweet, the garments one wears fine—self-sufficient and content, cherishing life—this is to value death.
To find this dwelling secure and this land’s customs joyful—this is to not wander far.
Who would lightly abandon their birthplace to wander elsewhere, when they may grow old and die there?

Neighboring states lie in sight, their roosters and dogs heard in one another’s lands—yet let the people live out their lives without venturing beyond.

This is to say the people hold their native soil dear.
Though neighboring states are close enough to see and hear one another’s roosters and dogs, even at such proximity, the people do not travel between them—let alone wander far.

**Chapter 67**
Faithful words are not ornate; ornate words are not faithful.
The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.
Truthful speech requires no embellishment; embellished speech is surely false and artificial.
Those truly skilled do not boast of their eloquence; those who boast of their eloquence are not truly skilled.
Those truly wise do not seek breadth of knowledge; those who seek breadth of knowledge do not truly comprehend its essence.

Thus, this book concludes with such words—its language is harmonious, simple, and unadorned, neither argumentative nor overly broad. It is the speech of true virtue and true wisdom, unadorned and unfeigned.

The Sage does not hoard.
The more one gives to others, the more one possesses;
The more one shares with others, the more one has.
Not hoarding means emptiness and lack of accumulation.
To act for others with what one knows, to speak for others with what one understands—
Empty and without accumulation, thus one’s responses are boundless.
If one accumulates and claims possession, then one’s responses are limited—how could one ever have more and more?

Zhuangzi said:
*"To consider accumulation as insufficient is to have no storehouse, thus there is abundance."*

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;
The Dao of the Sage acts without contending.
Benefiting is the opposite of harming—where there is benefit, there must be harm.
Yet the Dao of Heaven, though beneficial, does not harm, for it benefits by not benefiting—thus there is no harm.
Action is the beginning of contention—where there is action, there must be contention.
Yet the Sage’s Dao, though it acts, does not contend, for it acts by not acting—thus there is no contention.

**Chapter 68**
This concludes the two sections, revealing that all five thousand words adhere to this principle.

The *Laozi*’s text contains many errors. After collating the variations from dozens of editions and verifying their authenticity, the result is as above.

The *Zhuangzi* transmitted by Master Zhuang Junping contains seventy-two chapters, while other editions transmit eighty-one. However, some chapters were incorrectly divided, so it is standardized here as sixty-eight chapters: the upper section with thirty-two chapters (2,366 characters), the lower section with thirty-six chapters (2,926 characters), totaling 5,292 characters.

Prefaced by Wu Cheng of Linchuan. The *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* is completed, Volume Four.
