**Preface to the *Exegetical Commentary on the Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void***

Before the birth of Zhuangzi, the Way of Liezi had already flowed boundless and formless, suffusing the Great Void without trace or sound. Thus, his writings elucidated the profound obscurities of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, dissecting the roots of life and death, stripping away concealments and unraveling entanglements, lancing boils and draining abscesses. His words spoke of spontaneity without self-awareness, of non-action while allowing all things to follow their course. His phrasing ranged freely, like withered leaves and dry husks, riding the wind east and west, drifting and admonishing between heaven and earth without limit.

Later, Zhuangzi frequently cited his words in discourses, and thus the world came to speak of "Lao-Zhuang" rather than "Lao-Lie." This is because Zhuangzi harmonized differences into unity, his meaning threading through all, distinguishing hardness and whiteness while embracing both being and non-being.

In the past, Liezi dwelled in seclusion in Putian for forty years, yet none recognized him; he concealed his form among the common folk, and even the lord of the state knew him not—such was his heavenly obscurity. A man may possess the Way yet receive no praise; how could the Way be trivial? A book may contain principle yet seldom be acknowledged; how could it be coarse? This man, this book—profound and distant, returning with things to their source—how lofty it is!

From my youth, I delighted in reading this work, yet suffered from the lack of phonetic glosses and explanations to resolve my confusions. In later years, while wandering beneath the watery canopy of Siming at Tongbai on Mount Tiantai, I obtained two tattered scrolls, their titles faintly marked as *Exegetical Commentary on Liezi*. The paper and ink were decayed, unfit for leisurely perusal, so I hastily transcribed them. Much was lost to moths and decay, obliterated and fragmented, with four or five parts in ten missing. Yet at the end of the scroll was inscribed: *"Compiled by Yin Jingshun, Vice Magistrate of Dangtu County, Tang; transcribed by Mo Xizi of Mount Heng."* I roughly copied and stored it in my satchel.

Later, on Mount Qian, I found a handwritten copy of *Liezi* by the Tang Daoist Xu Lingfu, along with Lu Chongxuan’s commentary preserved in a private collection. Comparing these with the printed edition from the Directorate of Education during the Jingde era, I collated discrepancies, noting variants and assembling a record of errors and divergences in one scroll, appended to the commentary. Subsequently, I filled lacunae and restored omissions, recovering the original order.

Among the finest explanations by earlier scholars was the identification of *cheng* (程) as a variant name for *biao* (豹), which in ancient script comprises the two characters *tai* (泰) and *bing* (丙). Such erudition and breadth of knowledge! Any oversights or omissions await the emendations and insights of like-minded scholars.

**New Catalogue of *Liezi***

Surname: Lie. Given name: Yukou, or alternatively Yukou.
Preceding Zhuangzi, hence Zhuangzi’s references to him.
At the beginning of the Tianbao era, by imperial decree, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected of the Unfathomable Void, and his work was retitled *Classic of the Unfathomable Void*, its name heading the eight chapters.
This edition was compiled by Liu Xiang, who selected twenty chapters, removed redundancies, and titled it *New Book*.
In the fourth year of the Jingde era of the Great Song, the title was augmented with "Perfect Virtue," becoming *Classic of Perfect Virtue of the Unfathomable Void*.
The collator, Liu Xiang, styled Zizheng, was a descendant of Liu Jiao, Prince Yuan of Chu during the Han.
Thus was this book collated and annotated. May the teachings of its sounds and meanings be revered!

Within the text, the character "与" frequently appears in this form.

Additionally, Han Zhi of Chenliu authored the *Xuan Shi* in eight pian, offering an expanded exegesis of the *Five Thousand Character Text*.

The *Zhigui*: Yan Zun of Han, styled Junping, authored the *Zhigui* in fourteen pian, providing an expanded exegesis of the *Five Thousand Character Text*.

It does not cross the Ji. "*Bù yú Jǐ*" is pronounced *zǐ lǐ*.

"*Mò*" is pronounced *hè*, resembling the fox and fond of sleep, a beast.

If it crosses the Wen, it dies. "*Yú Wèn*" is pronounced *wǔ jīn*. Deng Yuan’s *Commentary on the Water Classic* states: the Ji River originates from Mount Wangwu, forming the *duì* sound. As the Yan River, it flows east through Wen, becoming the Ji River, then enters the Yellow River over ten *li* downstream. Southward, it meanders into the river, forming Rong Marsh, and further flows through Jiyin and nine other commanderies before reaching the sea. *The Rites of Zhou* states: the *qúyù* does not cross the Ji, and the *mò*, if it crosses the Wen, dies—such is the influence of the land’s *qi*. Zheng Xuan notes: the Wen River lies north of the city of Lu, and earlier scholars, following one another, mistakenly took it for the Wen River of Lu. This is a grave error. According to *Records of the Grand Historian*, the Wen shares the same pronunciation as *□*, *wǔ jīn*, referring to the Wen River of Jiang. It is not the Wen pronounced *wèn*. As *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* records: the Great River emerges from Mount Wen. Guo Pu comments: it flows southeast toward Shu Commandery, northeast toward Badong and Jiangxia, and reaches the sea at Guangling. *Han’s Outer Commentary on the Book of Songs* states: of old, the Jiang River issued from Mount Wen; at its source, it was but a shallow stream, sufficient to float a winecup. The *Songs of Chu* also speak of "the clear Jiang of hidden Mount Wen." This is conclusive. Moreover, *Liezi* and *The Rites of Zhou* both affirm that the nature of water and soil differs, and transplantation causes harm. Thus, the four great rivers are cited as examples. Now, the Wen River of Lu spans no more than a few dozen paces, its source extending no farther than two hundred *li*. Even Yang Li crosses it with ease, traversing it in moments. How could the fox or *mò* perish merely by briefly venturing across? *The Explanation of Graphs* states: the *mò* is a kind of fox, all of which thrive in hilly, arid lands. Today, people living by the river say: "The *zhuā* does not ford the Jiang." Clearly, crossing great waters harms their innate nature, leading to their death.

*The Classic of Ancient Bo* states: The rules of *bo* require two players to sit facing each other across a board divided into twelve paths, with the two ends at the center called "the waters." Twelve *mu* pieces are used—six white and six black—along with two fish pieces placed in the waters. The dice are made of *qiong*, a square of one *cun* and three *fen*, five *fen* in length, with pointed ends and drilled indentations on four sides called "eyes" or "teeth." The two players take turns casting the dice to move their *mu* pieces. When a *mu* reaches a position, it is stood upright and called a "valiant *mu*," which then enters the waters to eat the fish—also called "leading the fish." Leading one fish earns two tallies; flipping one fish earns three tallies. If one has already led two fish but fails to win, it is called "being flipped with double fish," and the opponent gains six tallies, achieving a great victory.
