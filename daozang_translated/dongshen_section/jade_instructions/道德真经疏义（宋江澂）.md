**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***

With reverence, I acknowledge the Sacred Sovereign’s enlightenment, whose teachings illuminate the Dao and the True. In moments of leisure and clarity, he selected *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*, elucidating each sentence to bless the world.

As a subject among the assembled scholars, a student of the Imperial Academy, I purified my mind and, with humility, read the Sovereign’s work. I reflect: no text is more useful than the *Dao De Jing*, yet *Laozi’s* Five Thousand Words are the very essence of Dao and virtue. Though concise, they encompass the vast; though varied, they harmonize. They restore the natural order and govern the present age. Their words are simple, yet their meaning profound—only a Sage could articulate them thus.

Since the Zhou Dynasty, countless scholars have expounded upon it, numbering over a hundred schools, yet most are clouded by their own biases, failing to grasp the True Dao. Their interpretations, though well-intentioned to honor the Sage’s teachings, often contradict them. Only those who deeply enter the Dao and attain divine insight can truly comprehend it.

I reverently observe that the Emperor, taking One as the standard for the world, embracing Unity as the model for all, embodies simplicity and sincerity, extending governance to both humanity and Heaven. The subtleties of the Dao reside inherently in virtue, yet must be spoken and believed, guiding scholars to their rightful path.

The Sovereign’s learning is profound and complete, like the *Yi Jing* with its *Xici* (系辞), truly the words of a Sage. Yet the Dao, once spoken, cannot be fully perceived by sight or hearing—its application is boundless. How then can I, with limited senses, describe its ineffable depths with finite words? I dare not presume, knowing my understanding falls short.

I have observed how the Emperor’s predecessors, such as the Tang Emperor, composed refined commentaries, and Du Guangting (杜光庭) further expounded with the *Guangsheng Yi* (广圣义). How much less am I, though long instructed, to dare follow in their footsteps? Thus, I humbly offer this commentary, though I know my words are inadequate.

**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Scroll One**
*By Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy*

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
*The Dao* is the shared path of all people.
*Virtue* is what the heart naturally attains.
*The Dao* endures through all ages without decay,
while *virtue* fulfills one’s nature and remains constant.

When *Laozi* lived in the late Zhou, the Dao declined and virtue waned. Thus, he wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, calling it the *Jing* (经). His words are concise, his meaning profound—scholars must meditate deeply to grasp them.

**Jiang Cheng’s Commentary:**

That all things follow it is called the *Dao*.
The *Dao* pervades all existence, yet is not confined—neither the vastness of Heaven and Earth nor the minutiae of an autumn hair escape its embrace. Even within boundaries, nothing exists without it. How much more so for humanity?

Mencius said: *"The Dao is like a great road."* Yet the character for *Dao* (道) shares its form with *"road"* (道路), for humanity cannot traverse beyond it. Thus, it is clear that the *Dao* is the shared path of all.

That which the *Dao* embodies within us is called *virtue*.
*Virtue* in humanity is complete in life and sufficient in allotment. Before form takes shape, it enables existence; it requires no external cultivation nor reliance on others—it is self-derived. What else could it be?

Yang Zhu said: *"Virtue is what one attains."* The character for *virtue* (德) derives from *"straight heart"* (直心), meaning it is not acquired from others but is self-attained. Thus, *virtue* is what the heart naturally possesses.

Moreover, the *Dao* is boundless while *virtue* is cultivated. Only because the *Dao* is boundless does it remain unchanged through ages, unconstrained by time—ever renewing, never ending. The *Jing* states: *"The Dao is enduring."* This is why it persists through all ages without decay.

Only because *virtue* is cultivated does it expand the four cardinal virtues, transforming myriad forms without alteration, nurturing and fulfilling them without separation. The *Classics* say: *"Virtue is the beginning of nature."* This is why it perpetually resides within one’s nature.

The *Dao* has ascents and descents; *virtue* has flourishing and decline. In eras of order, the *Dao* is exalted and *virtue* thrives, while in times of decay, the *Dao* wanes and *virtue* diminishes. By the late Zhou, the Great Dao had faded, and *virtue* further declined, fragmenting into the myriad doctrines of the Hundred Schools, obscured by conflicting theories—neither comprehensive nor pure. Thus, the arts of the *Dao* became divided across the land.

*Laozi*, pitying that the wondrous *Dao* had no successor and that the people remained unaware, took *emptiness* as his principle and *non-action* as his foundation, aligning with the ultimate patterns of nature. He wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, so that those who read his words might perceive the completeness of Heaven and Earth and the grand essence of antiquity. This is why his work differs from the Hundred Schools and is called the *Jing*.

For the *Jing* has a fixed structure, hence it is called *"constant"*—like the *Jing* (经) of stars, which adorn the heavens unmoving, or the *Jing* (经) of weaving, which guides the loom without alteration. Thus, it is called the *Jing*.

Observe his work: it encompasses all subtleties, vast and complete, yet contains no more than five thousand words. Its language is concise. One year cannot exhaust its transformations; a lifetime cannot fathom its depths. Its meaning is profound.

The scholar who merely knows the words yet fails to grasp their meaning, or who attains the meaning yet clings to the words, has not truly understood. The *Yǔ* (语, "Sayings") states: *"Silent reflection reveals its essence."* Mencius says: *"The gentleman cultivates deeply through the Dao, seeking to attain understanding on his own."* The eternal principles of Dao and virtue cannot be fully captured by mere speech or shallow perception; only through the heart’s intuition and divine comprehension can one transcend the words and their intent, recognizing the unrecognizable and thus drawing from their profound depths. This is the true essence of this book.

Thus, the Sage’s composition begins with the first chapter, expounding the marvels of the Dao to awaken the scholar’s mind, offering the instruction to reflect in silence and cultivate deeply.

**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken**

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

Huizong’s annotation says: *"The Dao is without beginning; it cannot be spoken of. When spoken of, it is not the true Dao."*

Again, it says: *"The Dao cannot be named."* Yet the Dao that can be spoken of and named—like the unfolding of seasons or the rise and fall of affairs—responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, not an unchanging truth. The eternal Dao and eternal Name are self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, they were already fixed and enduring from ancient times. The Lord Fu Xi attained this Dao and sat in the *Shǎoguǎng* (少广, "Minor Expansion"). No one knows its beginning, no one knows its end.

The *Shūyì* (疏义, "Explanatory Notes") say: *"What can be spoken of are the coarse aspects of things."* The utmost subtlety of the Dao is far removed from such things, hence it cannot be spoken of.

When Confucius saw Wen Bo Xue (温伯雪), his gaze struck and the Dao was preserved—this is why. Zhuangzi recorded the words of the Dao’s beginning: *"The Dao cannot be spoken of; when spoken of, it is not the true Dao."* Is this what is meant?

At the dawn of creation, there was *wu* (无, "non-being") and *you* (有, "being"). Non-being had no name; when things formed and their numbers were fixed, then names and perceptions arose. The Dao is not confined by things nor trapped by numbers—when viewed, it cannot be seen. Who could name it? This is what Zhuangzi called *"the great Dao does not affirm itself."*

Again, it says: *"The Dao cannot be named."* Is this what is meant?

Indeed, the principles of the world have what is *ke* (可, "affirmable") yet also what is *buke* (不可, "unaffirmable"). When form takes shape, there is what cannot yet be affirmed, and when the pattern emerges, it is both affirmable and unaffirmable, affirmable yet unaffirmable. Things have no fixed appropriateness, affairs no fixed wrongness; the waxing and waning of all things, the flourishing and decline of seasons—spring and summer first, autumn and winter last—each season’s rise and fall, hidden yet manifest, manifest yet hidden, formed then destroyed, destroyed then formed, what was once true now false, what was once discordant now harmonious—all follow the fittingness of the time. When the Dao that can be spoken of and named responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, it is not the true eternal Dao.

Although names and realities exist, they belong to things; what can be spoken of and perceived grows ever more distant when spoken of. Though the Dao cannot be spoken of, there remains a Dao that is not spoken of; though the Name cannot be named, there remains a Name that is not named. The Dao that is not spoken of is called the *constant Dao*; the Name that is not named is called the *constant Name*.

The meaning of "constant" lies in its enduring completion without change, its permanence through time. The Dao as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *"It stands alone, unaltered."* The Name as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *"From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade."* Yet things that arise must have their origins and roots, whereas the constant Dao and constant Name have no origins or roots. Things arise from Heaven and Earth, but the constant Dao and constant Name precede Heaven and Earth in their birth.

Though *qi* (气) gathers and scatters, this Dao has no departure or arrival; though forms emerge and perish, this Dao has no existence or annihilation. *"Self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already fixed and enduring from ancient times."* Those who attain this Dao ascend to supreme sovereignty, which is why Fu Xi attained it and inherited the *Qi Mu* (气母, "Mother of Qi").

The *Qi Mu* is the origin of *qi*, the primordial source from which all *qi* arises. Attaining it allows one to wander within the *Tai Chu* (太初, "Supreme Beginning"), as the *Jing* says: *"Having known its children, one must then guard its mother."* This is the way to eternal life, which is why the Western Sovereign Mother sits in the *Shǎoguǎng*, her beginning unknown, her end unknown.

For the Dao has no head at its start, no tail at its end. Those who embody the Dao—who could trace its origin? Who could limit its conclusion? The *Jing* says: *"Having obtained its mother, one knows its children."* The Dao is nameless at its beginning, yet it is the mother of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things.

Huizong’s annotation says: *"The Dao is ever nameless, yet Heaven and Earth depend upon it to arise—this is what Zhuangzi called 'generating Heaven and generating Earth.'"*

Before Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Thus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. With Heaven and Earth, all things then arise, so the named is the mother of all things.

The *Shūyì* say: *"The Dao’s utmost subtlety cannot be sought through wisdom nor found through form—though one desires to name it, it cannot be attained."* The Dao’s name is a borrowed designation; calling it the Dao is merely a forced naming. This is the Dao hidden within the nameless.

*"The Dao is ever nameless"*—this is what is meant. The *Yijing* (易) states: *"The Great Polarity (太极) gives rise to the Two Principles (两仪)."* Heaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things, yet formed things arise from the formless. How then do Heaven and Earth arise? It is from the Dao alone, *"the mother of all beneath the heavens."* This is what Zhuangzi called *"generating Heaven and generating Earth."*

The nameless has no reality—it exists in the void of things. When things coalesce in indistinct unity, before Heaven and Earth arise, it is still void. Thus, before Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Though Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, all things depend upon them to arise. The world has a beginning; calling it the mother of the world means Heaven and Earth depend upon the Dao to manifest.

All things draw their origin from the Great Primordium (*Buqian* 乾元), yet though their source is vast, they still rely upon it to flourish. All things draw their life from the Supreme Receptivity (*Kunyuan* 坤元), yet though their foundation is profound, they still depend upon it to manifest. When we trace what sustains the singular thread of the One, what substance is it? It is but the Dao alone. This is why it is said, *"Only after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being."* This is the Dao made manifest in named existence.

The Dao is singular in essence. When gathered, it forms substance; when dispersed, it marks the beginning. From its original source, it remains hidden in the Nameless—this is called the Beginning. From its manifestation, it appears in the Named—this is called the Mother. Though the terms differ, their root is one.

Though Heaven and Earth mark the Beginning, today’s scholars recognize this. If one truly perceives the Dao, then even before Heaven and Earth existed, their origin could be known. This is how the Sage knows Heaven and Earth’s Beginning *after* their existence.

To observe its subtlety, one must remain in the Constant Void;
To grasp its breadth, one must embrace the Constant Manifest.

The *Huizong* commentary states: Zhuangzi said, *"Establish it in the Constant Void."* To erect nothing is the Constant Void. To discard nothing is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void lies in principle—its upper reaches are unfathomable, the essence of all beneath the heavens, hence its subtlety is observed. The Constant Manifest lies in affairs—its lower reaches are boundless, the transformation of all beneath the heavens, hence its breadth is grasped.

The realms of Having and Not-Having intertwine, where subtlety and breadth reside. Great wisdom unites both perspectives, leaving nothing unattainable. In the hazy and indistinct, there are forms and things. Small wisdom clings to one-sidedness, blinded by partiality, abandoning the Manifest for the Void, or the Void for the Manifest, neglecting the root for the branches—thus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: Without motion, there is generation of the Manifest—this is its utility. When the Manifest reaches its limit, it returns to the Void—this is its function. The Manifest does not depart from the Void, so the Void is not truly Void. The Void does not abandon the Manifest, so the Manifest is not truly Manifest. To establish it in the Constant Void is to affirm the Void that is not Void. To establish it in the Constant Manifest is to affirm the Manifest that is not Manifest. Though transformations are boundless, their foundation remains unchanging—this is why it is called Constant.

Zhuangzi expounds Laozi’s teachings: *"Establish it in the Constant Void."* Yet his text begins with this very principle, deeply grasping the logic of Having and Not-Having. Thus, when purifying away all things, even sage wisdom, righteousness, and propriety would be discarded—this is the Constant Void. When establishing all laws, even affairs, forms, and names would be preserved—this is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void in principle has never given rise to things; hidden and difficult to know, even divine vision cannot perceive its form. Hence, its upper reaches are unfathomable, revealing the small yet subtle—entering the divine through its minuteness, thus becoming the essence of all beneath the heavens. The Constant Manifest in affairs encompasses all virtues; evident and easily seen, it is manifest yet concealed. Hence, its lower reaches are not obscured, revealing the great yet broad—emerging from clarity and vastness, thus becoming the transformation of all beneath the heavens.

Confucius composed the *Yijing*. When about to act or move, he spoke of nothing finer than the essence of all beneath the heavens—this is because from the Void to the Manifest, principle dictates so. In the arrangement of trigrams and their transformations, he spoke of nothing broader than the transformation of all beneath the heavens—this is because gathering the Manifest into the Void, affairs dictate so.

The Constant Void and Constant Manifest arise from the same source; the utmost subtlety and transformation stem from the same divine origin. Though their names differ, their principle is one.

Though Having and Not-Having are unified, their utility and application shift—
In the Manifest, they are concealed; in the Void, they are revealed.
Called subtle, called wondrous—merely their dwelling place.

Only great wisdom, viewing near and far, knows that the root of the Manifest is not truly Manifest—
Those who cling to it as Manifest still harbor the Void within.
Knows that the Void is not truly Void—
Those who reject it as Void still contain the Manifest.

In the hazy and indistinct, forms are visible;
In the indistinct and hazy, things coalesce indistinctly.

The obscure interplay of Having and Not-Having—
When observed through the Dao, all is exhausted,
And the whole becomes one, leaving nothing unattainable.

Common folk, bound by small wisdom, are blind to the great principle.
Some, obscured by the Dao’s stillness, discard the Manifest for the Void,
Drowning in seclusion, taking the non-Void as Void;
Some, lost in the Dao’s motion, cling to superficiality,
Neglecting the root for the branches, entangled in forms,
Taking the non-Manifest as Manifest;
Or making nothingness the way, fixated on one aspect—
A hundred schools, each boasting their strengths.
Thus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.

These two—though differing in name, they share the same origin—
Both are called the Mysterious.

The *Huizong* commentary states: The Dao is formless—
Who can grasp its breadth and subtlety?
Things and self share the same root;
Right and wrong arise from the same *qi*—
Thus they are both called the Mysterious.

The deluded of the world seek falsehood for truth,
Moving farther from truth, unaware that
Having and Not-Having are but differing names.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: The true origin is singular and complete,
Without form yet encompassing all—
The form of the formless, exhausting the boundless.
Only breadth and subtlety are indistinct, without division.
Thus the Dao is formless—
Who can grasp its breadth and subtlety?

From the Dao descending, distinctions arise.
The ignorant, clinging to self and objects, give rise to the illusion of self and other.
This is that, and that is this—
Yet from the indistinct emergence of *qi*, *qi* is singular.
Thus, things and self share the same root;
Right and wrong arise from the same *qi*—
Converging all differences into one origin—
Who is truly Having, who truly Not-Having?

Thus, the same is called *Xuan* [玄].
The confused of the world take the *wu* [無] for true and the *you* [有] for delusion,
Gathering delusion to seek truth, moving farther from truth—
Yet they fail to know that *wu* is the subtle *you*, and *you* is the true *wu*.
Names are contrary, yet their essence harmonizes.

*Xuan* again *xuan*—the gateway to all subtleties.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation says: The *Suwen* [素问] states: *Xuan* gives birth to the numinous.
The *Yijing* [易] says: The numinous—
This is the subtle speech that encompasses all things.

To refine subtlety to its utmost is *xuan*.
*Xuan* is the color of Heaven.
What is colored by color is manifest,
Yet the coloring itself is never fully revealed.
*Xuan* again *xuan*—this is what is meant by "coloring."

The subtle principles of *xuan* pervade all things:
Heaven’s movement, Earth’s repose, humanity’s vitality,
The flourishing of all creatures—
All are subtle, all emerging from *xuan*.
Thus it is called the gateway to all subtleties.

Confucius composed the *Yijing*, only reaching the *Shuogua* [说卦] to speak of subtlety,
While Laozi placed this at the beginning of his work.
The sages’ words complement each other as end and beginning.

The *Cushui* [疏义] says:
Wind generates wood, wood generates the liver,
In Heaven it is *xuan*, in humanity it is the Dao.
The Dao generates *yi* [一], thus the Dao descends and emerges,
Emerging to generate wisdom.
*Yi* generates *er* [二], thus *xuan* ascends and enters,
Entering to generate the numinous.

The numinous in its function—
Boundless, formless, pervasive without end,
Light and clear as Heaven, relying on it to move,
Heavy and turbid as Earth, relying on it to rest,
The harmonious *qi* of *Kun* [坤], relying on it to be vital—
Down to all creatures thriving in their roles,
All rely on this to flourish.
Thus, what subtly encompasses all things is none other than the numinous,
And what generates the numinous originates from *xuan*—
Hence it is the gateway to all subtleties.

Truly, when it emerges, it is vast and red;
When it enters, it is small and *xuan*.
Small and subtle—this is *xuan*,
Because it enters and becomes small.

If we speak of *xuan* virtue—
It is virtue entering and becoming small.
If we speak of *xuan* darkness—
It is entering into darkness and becoming small.
Though *xuan* is small, it remains subtle,
Yet it has not yet departed from color—
As the *Yijing* says: "Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow,"
And Zhuangzi says: "The *xuan* sky."
Thus, *xuan* as color has red and black—
Red for *yang*, black for *yin*.
All things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,
Yet *xuan* can be *yin* and can be *yang*—
Then what is confined to *yin* and *yang*?
Can it truly transcend this?
Much less *xuan* itself!

What constitutes *xuan* is *xuan* again *xuan*—
As the *Liezi* [列子] says: "Coloring."

All things emerge yet their gateway is unseen—
It lies here.

Although Confucius composed the *Yijing*, only reaching the *Shuogua* to speak of subtlety,
While Laozi placed this at the beginning of his work—
The *Yijing*, from exhausting principles to fulfilling nature and destiny,
Is a sequence of entering the Dao through speech,
And returning function to essence.
Laozi’s work, with returning to the root and restoring destiny as its priority,
Is a sudden manifestation of the Dao in action,
Showing that the numinous arises from essence in function.
The *Yijing* uses symbols and numbers, Laozi uses *you* and *wu* to demonstrate *xuan*—
Though their words differ, they complement each other as beginning and end.
Though their teachings seem disjointed, their essence is one.

**Chapter Two: All Under Heaven Know**

All under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises;
All know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
The Dao has no differing forms—who is beautiful or ugly?
Nature is inherently unified—who is good or bad?
There is beauty, and ugliness is its opposite,
Thus it is said: All under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises.
There is goodness, and not-goodness is its opposite,
Thus it is said: All know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.

What the world deems beautiful is the numinous and strange,
What it deems ugly is the stinking and rotten.
The numinous and strange transform into the stinking and rotten,
The stinking and rotten transform into the numinous and strange—
Then how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?

What was once right may later be wrong,
What is now discarded may later be used—
Then how can good and not-good be chosen?

The sage embodies the true *wu* while constantly *you*,
Manifests subtle function while constantly *wu*—
Beauty and ugliness, good and not-good,
Are to be simplified yet cannot be grasped—
How then can ugliness and not-goodness burden?

The *Cushui* says:
Under Heaven, there is no second Dao.
From their unity, the names of beauty and ugliness vanish,
One nature without nature—
From their origin, the distinctions of good and evil do not stand.
Yet there is high and low, with the latter as its subordinate,
Thus there is beauty with ugliness as its opposite,
There is left and right, with the latter as its subordinate,
Thus there is good with not-good as its opposite.

To have one without the other is to desire *yin* without *yang*—
How can this be achieved?

The people of the world know one aspect yet not the other,
Taking the numinous and strange as beautiful,
The stinking and rotten as ugly,
Yet beauty and ugliness fill the heart—
This is deemed right, that is deemed wrong,
And good and not-good oppose each other.

Yet they fail to know that Great Transformation is unceasing,
Instantly shifting—
The straight becomes strange, the good becomes ominous,
The stinking and rotten, the numinous and strange—
Alternating, transforming.
Initially, there is no beauty or ugliness,
Principle has no constant right,
Affairs have no constant wrong—
Sometimes right, sometimes wrong,
Gained then lost.
Initially, there is no good or not-good,
Life and death, giving and taking—
Also divided, also successive—
How can one judge them as different?

Only the sage awakens to this and merges into the mysterious,
Exhausts the truth of things while guarding their root,
Commands the transformation of things while guarding their origin—
Though *wuwei*, yet not neglectful of action,
Embodying true *wu* while constantly *you*,
Though engaged in affairs, yet emerging from non-action,
Manifesting subtle function while constantly *wu*.
Thus, extinguishing preferences in unity,
And entrusting right and wrong to the two processes.

The beautiful is beautiful of itself—I do not know it as beautiful;
The ugly is ugly of itself—I do not know it as ugly.
The good, I affirm as good;
The not-good, I also affirm as good.
Strange and wondrous, the Dao flows as one—
Though one might seek to simplify it, it cannot be done.
Then how can evil and not-good weigh me down?

Thus, the arising of having from non-being,
The completion of easy from difficult,
The contrast of long and short,
The tilt of high and low,
The harmony of sound and response,
The succession of before and after.

**Commentary by Emperor Huizong:**
Before the *Taiyi* was differentiated, all phenomena were of one body.
Once the Two Principles emerged, all things became paired opposites.
These six pairs—
Where myriad transformations intersect,
Where myriad thoughts arise,
Where divergent paths begin—
Are the snares by which the world is ensnared and cannot escape.

Non-being generates being, being returns to non-being—
Thus it is said: *having and non-being generate each other.*
There is difficulty in crossing perilous terrain,
Yet one knows the ease of traversing level ground—
Thus it is said: *difficult and easy complete each other.*
Long and short contrast, as with inches and feet.
High and low tilt against each other, as with mountains and marshes.
Sound strikes and echo responds—
Thus it is said: *sound and response harmonize.*
Form moves and shadow follows—
Thus it is said: *before and after succeed each other.*

The movement of yin and yang,
The progression of the four seasons,
The principles of all things—
Instantly formed, then instantly dissolved.
Its difficulty is like *wuwei* governing the world;
Its ease is like *wuwei* aligning with nature.

That which is long by nature cannot be severed,
That which is short by nature cannot be extended.
The sky’s height is not contrived—*the Dao’s own elevation;*
The earth’s depth is not imposed—*the Dao’s own descent.*

**Explanatory Notes:**
Before the *Taiyi*, the One Qi was undifferentiated,
A complete yet formless whole, undivided and indistinct—
Thus all phenomena were of one body.
The *Yijing* speaks of the *Taiji*, from which the Two Principles arise.
The Dao stands between opposites, giving rise to paired dependencies—
Thus all things become paired opposites.

The True Constant disperses into myriad transformations,
Unity divides into myriad thoughts,
Same origins diverge into varied paths—
None escape these six pairs.

Thus, when extended to the southeast, there is non-being generating being;
When contracted to the northwest, being reaches its limit and returns to non-being.
One and non-one cycle like this—*having and non-being generate each other.*

What is first difficult must later become easy;
What is first easy must later become difficult.
To encounter perilous difficulty,
One knows the ease of traversing level ground—
Thus difficulty and ease contrast like this.

Stretch out a finger to measure an inch,
Stretch out a hand to measure a foot—
Without the length of the foot,
One could not perceive the shortness of the inch—
This is *long and short contrasting each other.*
Mountains are steep and lean, marshes are fat and low—
Without the height of the mountains,
One could not perceive the depth of the marshes—
This is *high and low tilting each other.*

Sound strikes without generating sound, yet generates echo—
Thus sound strikes and echo responds—
This is *sound and response harmonizing.*
Form moves without generating form, yet generates shadow—
Thus form moves and shadow follows—
This is *before and after succeeding each other.*

In their principles and their affairs,
Their forms and their patterns,
Their sounds and their numbers—
Divided into yin and yang,
Arranged into the four seasons,
Dispersed into myriad things—
None escape these six pairs.

Instantly formed, they arise from non-being;
Instantly dissolved, they do not endure.
Applied to human affairs, one knows *wuwei* is not easy;
Retreating into obscurity, one knows *wuwei* is not difficult.

Ascending heights does not make one long—
Long is not excess, and innate long cannot be severed;
Descending lows does not make one short—
Short is not deficiency, and innate short cannot be extended.
The sky’s elevation is not contrived—*the Dao’s own nature;*
The earth’s depth is not imposed—*the Dao’s own nature.*

The **Dao** manifests through resonance and rhythm—
Then some are **official pitches**, some are **angle pitches**, following the drum’s movement.

In their ordered sequence and inherent logic,
The four seasons, long and short, each maintain their proper ranks.

All that enters the realm of **opposition and correspondence**—
Though all are the **Dao’s** abode,
They stray far from the **Dao** itself.

Thus the **sage** dwells in **non-action’s** affairs,
Practices **non-speech’s** teaching.

*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: Dwelling in **non-action’s** affairs is what *Zhuangzi* calls "employing the world without contriving." Practicing **non-speech’s** teaching is what the *I Ching* calls "teaching through the **Dao’s** divine course, so the world submits."

To act brings **completion and deficiency**;
To speak brings **rightness and error**.
Yet never free from entanglement—
How could the **sage** stand alone above all things,
Transforming all things while none could burden them?

*Explanatory commentary*: What must be done yet concealed is **affairs**.
**Non-action’s** affairs mean action arises from **non-action**—
This is the so-called "employing the world without contriving."

Indeed, to employ the world is already to engage in **affairs**.
Only rooted in **non-action** does one act without touching **contrivance’s** edge.
Thus **Shun’s** inaction—
His decrees issued, yet all things flourished, attaining this.

**Cultivating the Dao** is what **teaching** means.
**Non-speech’s** teaching is through **personal example**, so people follow—
This is the so-called "teaching through the **Dao’s** divine course, so the world submits."

Indeed, to establish **teaching** is already to engage with things,
But when it springs from **divine Dao**, though **teaching** is given, the intent of speech is never uttered.
Thus **Wang Xi’s** upright stillness, never teaching, never deliberating—
He attained this.

Moreover, **non-action** is genuine,
**Action** is artifice.
If one labors in **affairs** and entangles in **human contrivance**,
How could there be **completion** without **deficiency**?

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak lack wisdom.
The **superior** speaks to the **inferior**, the **inferior** is taught—
Forcing instruction without pause,
One cannot avoid **rightness and error**.

The **sage** dawns and perceives **singularity**,
Embodies the **Dao’s** non-existence,
Responds to things while remaining in **non-being**.
In **affairs**, **non-action** yet **completion**;
In **teaching**, **non-speech** yet hearts delight.
Though myriad things fill the world,
They cannot prick his mind—
How could the **six pairs** burden him?

All things arise yet do not cling,
Are born yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely,
**Completion** achieved yet not claimed.
Only because he does not claim,
Thus he does not depart.

*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: All things arise together,
Responding to stimuli like a mirror reflecting forms—
Beauty and ugliness fully revealed.
Like valleys echoing sounds,
Good and bad all respond—
No refusal exists.
Hence it is said: "Arise yet do not cling."

They form and transform themselves,
Are born and colored by their own nature—
Each reaching their utmost height and grandeur,
Fulfilling their **innate essence**—
Who could possess them?
Hence it is said: "Are born yet do not possess."

Ordering all things yet not **perverse**,
Nurturing across ages yet not **benevolent**,
Covering heaven and earth,
Carving myriad forms—
Yet not **crafty**,
Hence it is said: "Act yet do not rely."

The **Dao’s** course in the four seasons—
When one **completes**, the other **retires**,
Heaven’s **Dao** indeed.
The **sage** embodies it,
Thus his **power** surpasses the world yet seems not of himself—
If he claims it, then he is already bewildered.
Hence it is said: "**Completion** achieved yet not claimed."

To claim brings **departure**—
Ancient and modern alike.
No claiming within himself,
Things cannot alter him.
Fitting to the **coming** is **timely**,
Fitting to the **going** is **orderly**—
What harm or gain could there be?
Hence it is said: "Only because he does not claim,
Thus he does not depart."

*Explanatory commentary*: With a single body facing the **myriad movements**,
With a single mind bearing the **world’s** demands—
Things may take from him,
Yet he remains **unperturbed**;
**Affairs** may press upon him,
Yet he remains **unmoved**.
Like a mirror responding yet not storing,
Like a valley empty yet able to receive—
Beauty and ugliness, good and bad—
No refusal exists.
If so, then his **universal response** and **harmonious fulfillment**
Are indeed abundant.

If he were to **flee** the **myriad** and **pursue** stillness,
Fearful of **excess** and **deficiency**,
Then how would things **open**?
How would **affairs** be **completed**?
How would the world **depend** on him?
This is called: "All things arise yet do not cling."

Self-formed, self-transformed,
Yet **endless generation and transformation**—
They do not **hoard** their **power**.
Self-shaped, self-colored,
Yet **myriad forms and hues**—
They do not **monopolize** their **completion**.
Those with **form** exert themselves through **form**,
Those with **essence** fulfill themselves through **essence**—
If he claims them, then he is already bewildered.
This is called: "Are born yet do not possess."

The **sage** responds to the world with **non-being** alone—
His ordering of all things is not from a **mind** of ordering.
Like **autumn’s** killing yet gentle in its severity,
Thus he kills yet none resent him.
His nurturing across ages is not from a **mind** of nurturing—
Like **spring’s** warmth yet granting **enlightenment** to all,
Thus his **virtue** extends to ages yet he does not **love** humanity.

Heaven covers without exclusion,
I have the **Dao** to cover what it covers;
Earth bears without rejection,
I have the **Dao** to bear what it bears.
Though a **yellow reed’s** stalk is slender,
If given **support and branches**, it thrives;
Though a **caterpillar’s** body is minute,
If given **uplift and wings**, it ascends.
Though not **carved** or **sculpted** by hand,
They rely on **Dao’s** transformation,
Not on **crafty cleverness**—
If **carving** and **sculpting** myriad forms,
Could this be the **crafty cleverness’** domain?

Ordering all things,
Nurturing across ages,
Covering heaven and earth,
Carving myriad forms—
Yet not **perverse**,
Not **benevolent**,
Not **crafty**,
Then it is **non-action** yet **completion**,
Not relying on its **achievement**.
This is called: "Act yet do not rely."

The four seasons differ in **qi**,
Yet their **Dao’s** course knows no halt—
**Steel** emerges, **Fire** withdraws;
**Wood** flourishes, **Water** decays.
They **consume** and **supplement** each other,
**Fill** and **empty** in turn—
Passing yet leaving no trace,
Heaven’s **Dao** has already **completed** its course.

The **sage** follows Heaven as his **tutor**,
So vast that none can name him,
Yet so towering that his **power** is **achieved**.
Though he has no **intent** to establish **power**,
The world **attributes** it to him.

「When he departs from **achievement** and **renown**,
Returns them to the people,
And does not consider them as his own private share—
How could he take them as real and fixed possessions?
This is called: **"Achievement without clinging."**

The **lamp’s** light is set in its **stand**,
Yet the flame before is not the flame behind;
Its brilliance is borrowed from the **mirror**,
Yet the form now is not the form of old.
What is past becomes **ancient**,
What is present becomes **present**—
Before the thought has fully formed,
The so-called "present" has already shifted to become the **ancient**.
To cling to the **having** is to invite the **losing**;
For the **spirit** is bodiless and does not cling—
Only when it takes **form** does it cling to the people.
Thus, the **sage** holds fast to the **spirit**,
Unshaken by **things**,
So within himself there is no clinging,
And **things** cannot alter him.
He does not bind himself to the **future**,
Yet knows when the **future** arrives;
He does not linger on the **past**,
Yet knows when the **past** departs in order.
What need is there for gain or loss?

Hence it is said:
*"Only by not clinging does one not lose."*

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting Virtue**

Not exalting the **virtuous**,
So the people do not contend;
Not treasuring **hard-to-obtain goods**,
So the people do not become thieves.

The **Emperor Xuan** annotated:
*"To exalt the virtuous leads to excessive knowledge,
To the point where the world is thrown into chaos,
And Confucians and Mohists all rise up in contention."*

*"To treasure goods leads to excessive desire,
To the point where thieves operate even at midday,
And people dig holes in broad daylight to steal."*

Not exalting the **virtuous**,
Then the people each settle into their **fate**,
And have nothing to **boast** or **strive** for,
Hence they do not contend.

Not treasuring **goods**,
Then the people each content themselves with their **fate’s** provisions,
And have no **covetous** schemes,
Hence they do not become thieves.

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"To curtail the deeds of the **Record-Keepers** (曾史),
And to gag the mouths of **Yang** and **Mo**,
Then the world’s **virtue** begins to return to **harmony**."*

The *Traveling to the South* chapter states:
*"Do not treasure rare **things**,
Use common **things** with humility,
Then the people will be content."*

The **Explanatory Notes** say:
*"Exalting means distinguishing and favoring.
If the virtuous are exalted, then the foolish and the wise will deceive one another,
The good and the bad will contradict each other—
The people will first be confused and chaotic,
To the point where the world is thrown into chaos,
And Confucians and Mohists all rise up in contention—
This is what is meant by: 'To promote the virtuous leads to the people trampling one another.'"*

*"Treasure means to value and seek.
If goods are treasured, then the hearts of envy and longing arise,
And the yearning for what is lacking spreads—
Seeing **gain**, they forget **form**;
Seeing **profit**, they forget **truth**—
To the point where thieves operate even at midday,
And people dig holes in broad daylight to steal—
This is what is meant by: 'Hard-to-obtain goods cause people to act recklessly.'"*

Only by not exalting the **virtuous**,
Then the **loyal** is truly **loyal** without knowing it,
The **faithful** is truly **faithful** without knowing it—
The people each settle into their **fate**,
Who would dare to **suppress** their own nature for the sake of **boasting**,
Or to **act** improperly to **strut**?
Each halts at their own station and does not contend—
This is enough.

This is what **Zhuangzi** meant when he said:
*"To curtail the deeds of the **Record-Keepers**,
Then the world’s **virtue** begins to return to **harmony**."*

Only by not treasuring **goods**,
Then the people **dig wells** to drink,
**Cultivate fields** to eat—
Each content with their **fate’s** provisions,
Who would dare to **covet** what they do not have,
Or to **scheme** after what they do not possess?
To **extinguish** their **thieving hearts** and not become thieves—
This is enough.

This is what **Zhuangzi** meant when he said:
*"To strike the **jade** and shatter the **pearls**,
Then petty thieves will not arise."*

**Not seeing what is desirable,**
So the heart does not **disturb**.

The **Emperor Xuan** annotated:
*"When people have **desires**,
They follow after **nature’s** provisions to **contend**,
And **seize**, **plunder**, **flatter**, and **deceive**—
There is nothing they will not do."*

**Bo Yi** saw the **desirability** of **right**,
And starved beneath **Chu Yang’s** slopes.
**Dao Hui** saw the **desirability** of **profit**,
And was slain upon **Dong Ling’s** heights.
Their **heat** scorches like **fire**,
Their **cold** chills like **ice**—
Thus their hearts are **agitated** and **proud**,
And cannot be **attuned** to the **Dao**.
To the point where the **sage**,
Does not **pursue** **profit**,
Does not **defy** **harm**,
Knows that **profit** and **harm** share the same **source**;
Does not **glory** in **prominence**,
Does not **shame** **obscurity**,
Sees **obscurity** and **prominence** as one **consistency**.
**Desires** do not **arise**,
Not a **thread** is **perturbed**—
My heart is **serene**,
No **thing** can **shake** it.
**Responding**, it **communicates**;
**Steady**, it **adapts** and **responds**.
**Halted**, there is no **obstruction**,
Not **stuck** to **stillness**;
**Moving**, there is no **chasing**,
Not **drawn** into **action**—
**Overturning** all **directions**,
**Displaying** them before me,
Yet none can **enter** my **dwelling**.
Who could **disturb** me?

**Confucius’s** "not **disturbed** at forty,"
**Mencius’s** "my heart does not **move** at forty,"
They attained this.

The **Explanatory Notes** say:
*"The common people see **things** but do not see the **Dao**,
So all they see is **desire**.
The **sage** sees the **Dao** but does not see **things**,
So all they see is **no desire**.
To see **no desire** means
To **master** what is seen over what is **glimpsed**,
Thus the **spiritual platform** is **held firm**,
And external **disturbances** are **dispelled** and **consumed**.
To see **only desire** means
To **be swayed** by what is **glimpsed** over what is seen,
Thus they **pursue** **things** and **lose their way**,
**Forget** **truth** and **drown** in **falsehood**.
The eyes **feast** on **colors**,
The ears **feast** on **sounds**,
The mouth **feasts** on **flavors**,
The nose **feasts** on **fragrances**—
These are what people **desire**.
The **foolish** and **ordinary** do not know
That **five colors** **disturb** the eyes,
That **five sounds** **disturb** the ears,
That **five flavors** **muddy** the mouth,
That **five scents** **perfume** the nose—
They follow after **nature’s** provisions to **contend**,
And **seize**, **plunder**, **flatter**, and **deceive**—
There is nothing they will not do.
Those **burdened** by **great profit** sacrifice their **bodies** for profit,
Those **burdened** by **high renown** sacrifice their **bodies** for fame.
Like **Bo Yi** and **Dao Hui**,
One dies for **renown**, one dies for **profit**—
Nearly **revealing** the **desirability** of **profit**!

Their **heat** scorches like **fire**,
Their **cold** chills like **ice**—
Unable to **control** it and preserve their **hearts**,
To the point where they are **agitated** and **proud**,
And cannot be **attuned**—
This is like **using** the **Husband of Sui’s** pearl to **lure** a thousand **ren’s** sparrow—
How could it not **disturb**?

The **sage** differs from this:
Does not **pursue** **profit**,
Does not **defy** **harm**,
Knows that **profit** and **harm** share the same **source**;
Does not **glory** in **prominence**,
Does not **shame** **obscurity**,
Sees **obscurity** and **prominence** as one **consistency**.
**Desires** do not **arise**,
Not a **thread** is **perturbed**—
My heart is **serene**,
No **thing** can **shake** it.
**Responding**, it **communicates**;
**Steady**, it **adapts** and **responds**.
**Halted**, there is no **obstruction**,
Not **stuck** to **stillness**;
**Moving**, there is no **chasing**,
Not **drawn** into **action**—
**Overturning** all **directions**,
**Displaying** them before me,
Yet none can **enter** my **dwelling**.
Who could **disturb** me?

**Confucius’s** "not **disturbed**,"
**Mencius’s** "heart does not **move**"—
They attained this.»

Thus the **Daoist Sage’s** governance:
**Empty** the heart, **fill** the belly,
**Weaken** the will, **strengthen** the bones,
Ever keep the people **ignorant**, **desireless**.

Huizong’s annotation:
*"Grain responds because it is empty,
A mirror reflects because it is empty,
A tube receives because it is empty,
Ears hear because they are empty,
Eyes see because they are empty,
The nose smells because it is empty.
If filled within, there is obstruction here.
The Sage, compelled to govern the world,
Views all equally as one,
Nears the close and lifts the distant,
Follows what is natural, lets it unfold—
What need for deliberation?
When **Emperor Yao** raised **Shun** and used **Gun**,
He nearly achieved this.*

An **empty** heart hears all impartially, without favor or aversion;
A **filled** belly suffices in contentment, without grasping or demand—
Why praise the **virtuous**? Why value wealth?

The Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes;
The belly, unselective, contains all.

The will follows where the heart directs;
The bones are the body’s foundation.
A **strong** will may sacrifice itself for fame without rest,
Or chase wealth without satisfaction,
Or boast of deeds, or pride in skill—
The farther from the **Way**, the worse.
**Weak** bones scatter the steps, clash with things,
Are worn down, sink without return.
The Sage’s will is ever **low**,
Yet people exalt it;
Ever **last**,
Yet people honor it first.
Knowing **masculine**, he guards **feminine**;
Knowing **glory**, he embraces **humiliation**—
This is **weakening** the will.
**Uprightness** halts it—
No thing can displace it.
**Firmness** grasps it—
No change can topple it.
Unbroken, like **Master Guangcheng**,
Living twelve hundred years without decay—
This is **strengthening** the bones.

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"In harmony with **non-knowing**, virtue does not depart;
In harmony with **non-desire**, this is called **primordial simplicity**.
**Primordial simplicity**—then the people’s nature is preserved.
The Sage’s governance seeks only that the people retain their nature.
Excessive knowledge harms the **allocation of life’s essence**,
Excessive desire drowns the **flow of life’s vitality**—
Called ‘governance,’ yet what chaos exceeds this?
Thus, ever keep the people **ignorant**, **desireless**."*

**Cushioning the Interpretation** says:
*"A house with no vacancy invites strife between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law;
A heart without **heavenly wandering** invites the six desires to contend—
Thus the ancients valued **emptiness** so greatly.
From the external world, like grain’s response,
A mirror’s reflection, a tube’s reception;
From within, like ears hearing, eyes seeing, noses smelling—
All because of **emptiness**.
**Emptiness** is the opposite of **fullness**;
**Fullness** brings obstruction,
**Emptiness** brings no gap.
Within the myriad things, within the self—
If **fullness** fills the core,
Obstruction arises here,
Because it cannot be without gaps.
The Sage, compelled to govern the world,
With boundless, impartial love,
Views all as one—
Extends this to that,
Nears the close, lifts the distant,
Follows what is natural,
Makes no distinctions,
Lets it unfold naturally—
No taking, no discarding,
Abandons all burdens, merges with **non-being**—
What need for deliberation?
Though **Shun** was wise and cultured,
**Yao** was not unaware—
He waited for **Shun’s** virtue to be recognized before raising him.
Though **Gun** was doomed to exile,
**Yao** was not ignorant—
He also used him provisionally, as the crowd demanded.
The Sage has no fixed will;
He takes the **Way** as his will—
Thus **Shun** could not but be raised,
**Gun** could not but be used.
Why?
**Emptiness** is not **nothingness**,
But the absence of **fullness**.
The heart contains all things,
Yet what it intends is not;
**Fullness** contains nothing,
Yet what it intends is not—
Thus the heart is fundamentally **empty**.
Only when the heart’s essence is exhausted,
And governance reaches its **emptiness**,
Does the Sage say:
‘The good, I approve;
The unvirtuous, I also approve,’
Listening impartially, observing without bias—
Why praise the **virtuous**?
Those who focus inward find sufficiency in the self;
Those who roam outward seek completeness in things.
Seeking completeness in things brings constant fear of lack;
Finding sufficiency in the self raises no envy.
The Sage does not covet wealth or rare goods,
For he finds sufficiency in the self and fills the belly.
When the belly is filled,
He withdraws vision, reverses hearing,
Guards the spirit within—
Thus contentment is stable, without grasping—
Why value wealth?
The will resides in the heart—
Thus the will is where the heart directs.
The form stands on the bones—
Thus the bones are the body’s foundation.
If the will is **strong** and not **weakened**,
It takes **display** as right.
Some sacrifice for fame without rest,
Some pursue wealth without satisfaction,
Some boast of deeds yet achieve nothing,
Some pride themselves yet grow no wiser—
Their distance from the **Way** is great—
Thus the will must be **weakened**.
If the bones are **weak** and not **strengthened**,
Steps scatter, the center has no anchor,
Clashing with things, worn down, sinking without return—
Drifting, lost, knowing not where to turn—
How could they stand firm?
Thus the bones must be **strengthened**.
The Sage’s use of will:
Low to tend himself,
Ever **last**,
Yet people honor him first.
Knowing **masculine**, he guards **feminine**—
No thing can overcome him;
Knowing **glory**, he embraces **humiliation**—
No thing can soil him.
**Weakening** the will:
**Uprightness** halts it—
No thing can displace it;
**Firmness** grasps it—
No change can topple it.
Deep-rooted, unbroken—
Long life, enduring vision—
Unchanging with **Heaven and Earth**,
Like **Master Guangcheng** nurturing his **form**,
Living twelve hundred years without decay—
This is **strengthening** the bones.
Excessive knowledge brings ruin—
Thus the people must be kept **ignorant**."*

「Nurturing the heart finds no better method than **cultivating few desires**—
Thus the Sage makes the people desireless.

In harmony with **ignorance**,
Their **virtue** becomes as thick as that of an infant,
And such **virtue** will not depart.

In harmony with few desires,
They reveal their **innate simplicity** and **embrace natural purity**—
Little private interest, few desires,
This is called **innate simplicity** and **natural purity**.

**Simplicity** means no admixture,
**Purity** means no dissipation—
**Simplicity** and **Purity** restore the people’s true nature.

The Sage’s presence in the world:
When the people recover their true nature, His work is done.

Who would dare to **excessively know** and thus **erode** the portion of life’s **essence**,
Or **multiply desires** and thus **drain** the emotions of life’s **essence**?

Thus the Sage **represses** the knowing ones,
So they dare not act.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
The **eloquent** dare not **flaunt** their words,
The **bold** dare not **exert** their strength,
The **skilled** dare not **boast** of their abilities,
The **wise** dare not **apply** their discernment.

To **fabricate cleverness**,
To **pursue ingenuity**,
To **proliferate laws and decrees**,
And thus **overwhelm** the people—
The Sage **prohibits** all such actions.

When the **Nine Ministers** accomplish their duties,
And the **talented officials** serve in their proper ranks,
Is this not to **utilize knowledge** for **crafty purposes**?
They merely **execute** the ruler’s commands,
And **transmit** them to the people.

Explanatory commentary:
The **eloquent** dare not **flaunt** their words—
They have no occasion to speak.
The **bold** dare not **exert** their strength—
They have no occasion to act.
The **skilled** dare not **boast** of their abilities—
So as not to **exploit** their talents.
The **wise** dare not **apply** their discernment—
So as not to **utilize** their wisdom.

**Discard cleverness**,
**Remove cunning**,
And **reduce punishments**.

All who **fabricate cleverness**,
Who **pursue ingenuity**,
Who **proliferate laws and decrees**,
And thus **overwhelm** the people—
The Sage **prohibits** and **stops** them.
Even if there are those who know,
Who would dare to act?

As in the time of **Shun**,
Where **Gao Yao, Kui, and Ji Ke** and their like
Had the **Nine Ministers** all fulfilling their duties,
And the **talented officials** serving in their proper ranks,
Yet they did not **pursue petty distinctions**,
Nor **exercise sharp discernment**,
Nor **wield wisdom** as a **crafty tool**.

They **heard the music** and **responded**,
They **observed the rituals** and **moved**—
They merely **executed** the ruler’s commands,
And **transmitted** them to the people.

**Acting without action**,
Then there is nothing that cannot be **regulated**.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
The Sage’s governance—
Does He **abandon** the people and **sever** all things,
And suddenly **establish** Himself in a realm of **no affairs**?
No—
**Action** arises from **non-action**.

The **variations** of all things lie in the realm of **form and below**.
The Sage **embodies the Dao**,
And **stands above** all things,
**Unifying** their **completion**,
**Regulating** and thus **governing** them.

Things have their **origins**—
**Follow** them to **observe** their **return**.
Things have their **birth**—
**Assist** them to **fulfill** their **growth**—
How could there be anything **unregulated**?

Thus, **governing above**,
The sun, moon, stars, and constellations **obtain** their **order**;
**Governing below**,
Birds, beasts, grasses, and trees **follow** their **nature**.

Explanatory commentary:
Those who **govern** the world,
If they **unify** in **non-action** and **ignore action**,
Then it is like **gathering clods** and **accumulating dust**—
**Non-action** yet **not in accordance with principle**.

If they **unify** in **action** and **ignore non-action**,
Then it is like **waves surging** and **fire racing**—
**Action** yet **not true**.

Only when **action** does not **depart** from **non-action**,
And **non-action** does not **neglect** action,
With **action arising** from **non-action**,
Then there is **ample room** for governing the world.
How could it be that He **abandons** the people and **severes** all things,
And suddenly **establishes** Himself in a realm of **no affairs**?

Now, the realm **above form** is called **Dao**,
From **Dao** descending,
Nothing **escapes** the realm of **things**—
Thus the **variations** of all things lie in the realm of **form and below**.

Only when one **discerns** that the **nature** of all things is **not** things,
Then there is **no gap** between them and **Dao**.

**Encompassing** all the **multitudes**,
**Unifying** them in **one principle**,
**Standing above** all things,
**Unifying** their **completion**,
**Regulating** and thus **governing** them.

Hence, as the Classic says:
“All things **rise together**—
I **observe** their **return**.”

And as **Yang Zhu** said:
“The ruler **completes** the **transformations** of **Heaven and Earth**.”

Thus, **looking upward** to **Heaven**,
One sees **swelling and contracting** with **constant measure**,
**Hidden** yet **manifest** with **constant degree**—
**Above**, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations **obtain** their **order**.

**Looking downward** to the **Earth**,
One sees the **flying, creeping, and growing**,
Each **obtaining** its **proper place**—
**Below**, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees **follow** their **nature**.

If so,
Then the world is **regulated** without **regulation**.

The Explanatory Commentary on the True Classic of Dao and Virtue, Volume Two begins.*

「The **Daoist scholar** Jiang Cheng’s **Explanatory Commentary**
**Chapter Four: The Supreme Purity of the Dao**

When the Dao is **supreme in purity** yet applied,
It is **never overfull**—
**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:
“The Dao has **sentience** and **trustworthiness**,
Thus it has **application**.
Without **action** and without **form**,
It is **never overfull**.”

The *Classic* states:
“All things bear **yin** and embrace **yang**,
**Supreme qi** brings them into **harmony**.”

The **principles** of all things:
If they **lean toward yang**, they become **excessively strong**,
Or **err through excess**.
If they **lean toward yin**, they become **weak**,
Or **err through deficiency**.

Neither **excess** nor **deficiency**—
This is called **supreme qi**.
**Supreme qi** is **the middle**,
Thus it is called **great harmony**.

The **high** are **checked**,
The **low** are **raised**,
Those with **excess** are **taken from**,
Those with **deficiency** are **given to**—
The Dao’s **application**,
**Nothing** escapes without attaining **its middle**.

**Pouring** from it, **never full**,
**Measuring** from it, **never exhausted**—
The more one **takes** for others, the more one **owns**,
The more one **gives** to others, the more one **possesses**,
The Dao’s **essence**,
Like the **Great Void**, envelops the **six extremes**,
How could it **be overfull**?

The **Explanatory Commentary** states:
“The Dao can **be transmitted** yet cannot **be received**—
Because it can **be transmitted**, there is **sentience** and **trustworthiness**,
Thus there is **application**.
A **single thread’s** subtlety,
If **nurtured** to **flourish**—
Is this not **sentience**?
A **dragonfly’s** minuteness,
If **supported** to **take wing**—
Is this not **sentience**?
**Cold and heat** **await** it to **come and go**,
Yet it **does not force** the **seasons**—
Is this not **trustworthiness**?
All things **await** it to **generate and grow**,
Yet each **follows** its **kind**—
Is this not **trustworthiness**?

Because it cannot **be received**,
It **acts without action** and **forms without form**,
Thus it is **never overfull**.

**Deep** in its **dwelling** yet **serene** and **unshaken**,
**Floating** in its **clarity** yet **tranquil** and **unstirred**—
Is this not **acting without action**?

**Dim** and **silent**, **hidden** and **mysterious**,
**Seized** yet **not obtained**—
Is this not **forming without form**?

The *Classic* states:
“All things bear **yin** and embrace **yang**,
**Supreme qi** brings them into **harmony**.”

**Yin** **halts** and **becomes still**,
All things **bear** it.
**Yang** **melts** and **becomes smooth**,
All things **embrace** it.

If one **follows Heaven** yet lacks **Earth**,
It **leans toward yang** and **errs through excess**.
If one **follows Earth** yet lacks **Heaven**,
It **leans toward yin** and **errs through deficiency**.

There must be **the middle of yin and yang**,
**Excessively strong** yet **not erring through excess**,
**Weak** yet **not erring through deficiency**—
This is **supreme qi**.

The **nature** of **supreme qi**,
**Heaven One** is its **root**,
**Heaven Five** is its **middle**—
Thus **Kun** is **the middle**,
**The middle** **connects above and below**,
This is called **great harmony**,
The Dao’s **ultimate application** lies here.

Thus:
The **high** are **checked** to **reduce their excess**,
The **low** are **raised** to **supplement their deficiency**,
Those with **excess** are **taken from**,
So **great** yet **not excessive**,
Those with **deficiency** are **given to**,
So **small** yet **not meager**.

The Dao’s **application**,
**Nothing** escapes without attaining **its middle**—
Thus it is said: *“When the Dao is supreme in purity yet applied.”*

**Supreme qi** is **not overfull**,
**Application** is **not empty**—
Not **overfull**,
Thus **pouring** from it **never full**;
Not **empty**,
Thus **measuring** from it **never exhausted**.

Only the Dao **cannot be encompassed** by **fullness** or **emptiness**,
Thus it **lends and fulfills**,
Yet its **application** is **unending**—
The more one **takes** for others, the more one **owns**,
The more one **gives** to others, the more one **possesses**.

Like the **Great Void** enveloping the **six extremes**,
With **no boundaries**,
**Immeasurable**,
Could it **be confined** by **vessels**?
How could it **be overfull**?

**Deep**—
It **seems like** the **source of all things**.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:
“Zhuangzi said:
*The **turtle’s** stillness is **depth**,
**Still water’s** stillness is **depth**,
**Flowing water’s** stillness is **depth**.
**Depth** is **empty** and **still**,
**Not mingling** with things—
This is the Dao’s **essence**.
Only because it is **empty**,
Does it **gather** all **substantial** things.
Only because it is **still**,
Does it **embrace** all **movements**—
This is the **root** of all things,
The **foundation** of **transformation**.
Thus it is said: *‘It seems like the source of all things.’*
Yet the Dao **originally has no roots**,
Things **naturally follow** the Dao—
Thus it is only **seeming** like this.”

The **Explanatory Commentary** states:
“Zhuangzi said:
*The Dao is deep in its dwelling.*
**Depth** reflects **flowing water’s** **returning** **wholeness**,
**Stillness** is **profound** and **level**,
**Inner clarity** yet **outer obscurity**,
Though **turtle’s** **stillness** and **flowing water’s** **stillness** differ,
It remains **deep** as itself—
**Probing** it reveals **greater depth**,
**Exhausting** it reveals **greater distance**,
This can be called **emptiness**.
**Waves** are **not evil**,
**Stillness** is **not beautiful**—
This can be called **stillness**.
The Dao’s **essence** resembles this—
Only **emptiness**,
Thus it **suffices** to **encompass** the **world’s** **substantial** things;
Only **stillness**,
Thus it **suffices** to **embrace** the **world’s** **movements**.
**Not becoming** things yet **able to make** things **become**,
The **root** of all things;
**Not transforming** yet **able to make** transformations **fulfill**,
The **foundation** of **transformation**—
Thus it **seems like** the **source of all things**.”

*The Wenzzi* states:
*“The **Empty and Unrestrained**,
The **source of all things**.”*
Its **meaning aligns** with this.

Though the Dao **responds** to things **occasionally**,
It **originally has no roots**—
**Moving** through all things,
Things **naturally follow** it—
Saying *“the source of all things”*
Is only **seeming** like this, yet **not truly**.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:
*“Sharpness** **harms**,
**Agitation** **mixes**—
**Blunting** its **sharpness**, it **does not contend**,
**Relieving** its **agitation**, it **does not disorder**.
**Harmonizing** its **light**—
Zhuangzi’s *“bright yet not dazzling”*—
**Aligning** with its **dust**—
Zhuangzi’s *“committing with things and sharing their waves”*.
**Inner sincerity** **unbroken**,
**Forming schemes** to **achieve brightness**,
Yet those who **abandon** it **avoid** it—
Is this not *“harmonizing its light”*?
**Adorning intelligence** to **startle the foolish**,
**Refining the self** to **illuminate filth**,
**Shining** as if **displayed**,
**Moving** like **sun and moon**—
Is this not *“aligning with its dust”*?

The **Sage** **blunts** its **sharpness**,
Thus **dwelling** among things **does not harm** things—
Things **cannot harm** it.

**Relieving** its **agitation**,
Then **what need** for **scheming**?
**What need** for **intelligence**?
**What need** for **adhesion**?
All things **lack** what could **disturb** its **heart**—
If so, then **no arrogant** **appearance**,
**No haughty** **qi**,
**Harmonized** yet **not yielding**,
**Greatly unified** with things—
To **communicate** the **world’s** **intentions**,
**Nothing** enters without **finding its own fulfillment**.”

The **Explanatory Commentary** states:
“**Sharpness** like **fire’s** **sharpness**,
Cannot **long endure**—
Thus it **harms**.”

*«Agitation* like the **flux of silk**—
A multitude of threads, **not unified**—
Thus it **entangles**.

**Blunting** its **sharpness** means no **distinct angles** stand erect,
**Whole** and **undifferentiated** in its **essence**—
Who could **compete** with it in **movement**?

This is what **Zhuangzi** spoke of as *“rooting in depth”*.

**Relieving** its **agitation** means the **Spiritual Pivot** (*lingtai* 靈台) **remains steadfast**,
**External obstructions** vanish, **perturbations** dissolve—
Who could **disorder** it?

This is what **Zhuangzi** spoke of as *“binding with restraint”*.

**Fire** **unifies** to form **light**,
Yet **harmony** alone **distinguishes** it—
Then it **preserves** itself without **display**,
**Conceals** itself without **action**,
Never **flaunting** its **course** to **please the multitude**.

In **Zhuangzi’s** *“Cutting Adornments”* chapter, it is said:
**“Luminous yet not dazzling.”**
To **speak** of **employing** its **light** without **boasting** of **illumination**,
Only then does it **align with Heaven’s virtue**.

This is called *“harmonizing its light”*.

**Coarse** yet **not wondrous**,
The **source of dust**—
If **uniform** yet **not divergent**,
Then it **shifts** with the **times**,
**Adapts** with the **world**,
Never **clinging to extremes** to **separate itself**.

In **Zhuangzi’s** *“Geng Sang Pu”* chapter, it is said:
**“With things it drifts and turns, yet follows their currents.”**
To **speak** of the **Classics of Vitality** (*Weisheng Jing* 衛生經),
It lies in **yielding** to things in **flexible harmony**,
Not in **rejecting** the world and **defying customs**.

This is called *“aligning with its dust”*.

But if **inner sincerity** is **not dissolved**,
Unable to **forget the heart**,
**Form** and **scheming** coalesce into **light**,
Yet **obscurity** is **not employed**,
The **abandoner** **avoids** it—
Yet it **cannot** **bury itself** among the people—
Is this not *“harmonizing its light”*?

**Adorning intelligence** to **startle the ignorant**,
Yet **not relinquishing** **intelligence**—
**Refining the self** to **reveal filth**,
Yet **not** like the **ignorant**—
**Luminous** as if **displayed**,
**Moving** like **sun and moon**—
Yet it **cannot** **be** like the **obscured**—
Is this not *“aligning with its dust”*?

Now, **the metal** (*fui* 兌) is **sharp**,
Its **utility** lies in **timely application**—
If **transferred** with **sharpness**,
Then there will be **times** of **ruin** and **breakage**—
How could it **avoid injury**?

Only by **blunting** it—
Then **sharpness** becomes **dullness**—
Who could **injure** it?
Thus, **blunting its sharpness**,
The **Sage** **dwells** among things **without harming** things,
Things **cannot harm** it.

**Agitation** is **woven** from **silk**—
Thus it **separates** **filth** and **impurity**,
**Unification** forms **substance**,
**Division** multiplies **threads**—
How could one **not be disturbed**?

Only by **relieving** it—
Then though **agitated**, it is **sealed**,
No **inner or outer** **thousandfold**—
**Thoughts** do not **sprout**,
**Machinations** do not **rise**,
**Covering** the **ten thousand directions**,
**Laying** them out before it—
Yet they **cannot** enter its **unification**.

Thus, **relieving** its **agitation**,
Then **what need** for **scheming**?
**What need** for **intelligence**?
**What need** for **adhesion**?
All things **lack** what could **disturb** its **heart**—
If so, then **no arrogant** **appearance**,
**No haughty** **qi**,
**Harmonized** yet **not yielding**,
**Greatly unified** with things—
To **communicate** the **world’s** **intentions**,
**Nothing** enters without **finding its own fulfillment**.»

**“Deep and still, yet as if existing.”**
**Xizong’s** (*徽宗*) **annotation** says:
**“The heart** like **dead ashes**,
**The body** like **dry wood’s branches**—
In **tranquil composure** (*taiding* 泰定),
**Heaven’s light** shines **self-illuminating**,
**Dull** yet **as if vanished yet existing**,
**Unformed** yet **spiritual**—
Is this not its **Dao/Way**?

The **Explanatory Commentary** states:
**“The heart** is the **confluence** of **spirit** (*shen* 神),
In the **Five Movements** (*wuxing* 五行) it is **fire**.
When it **has heart**,
It is like **fire** **touching** things and **revealing** its **radiance**—
When it **lacks heart**,
It is like **fire** **extinguished**, leaving only **ashes**.

If the **heart** is like **dead ashes**,
Then **no heart** **stirs** within it.

**Grasses and trees** **have life** yet **no awareness**,
Wood **until it decays** (*gao* 槁)
Not only **lacks awareness** but also **lacks life**.
If the **body** is like **dry wood’s branches**,
Then **life is abandoned**, **self is forgotten**—
Thus it is.

In **tranquil composure**,
**Heaven’s light** shines **self-illuminating**—
This is called *“great tranquility holds it, yet follows with radiance”*.
If so, then **neither acting nor ceasing**,
**Awakened** yet **as if vanished yet existing**;
**Neither presence nor absence**,
**Unformed** yet **spiritual**—
**Deep and still**, always **serene** in its **existence**,
**Resembling** yet **not**—
Thus, *“as if existing”*.

*“As if existing”* is **doubt**.
Is it **stuck** in one **bend** of **speech**?
**Deep and still, yet as if existing**—
This is its **Dao/Way**!

**“I do not know whose child it is,”**
**Xizong’s** (*徽宗*) **annotation** says:
**“Symbol** (*xiang* 象) is the **first manifestation** of **things**.
**Heavenly Sovereign** (*di* 帝) is the **spirit’s** **response** to **things**.
**Things** **emerge**, then **symbol** appears—
**Heavenly Sovereign** **manifests**, then **wondrous things** arise.

**Symbol of Heavenly Sovereign** is the **origin** of all **things**,
Yet **Dao/Way** **truly precedes** it.
This is what **Zhuangzi** said:
**“Spirits and Heavenly Sovereigns are spirits of Heavenly Sovereigns,”**
**“Generating Heaven and Earth.”**

**Visible** yet **not seen**,
**Audible** yet **unheard**,
**Seized** yet **not obtained**—
**Existing** yet **emerging** without **revealing** its **gate**,
Who could **know** it?
Thus it is said:
**“I do not know whose child it is.”*

The **Explanatory Commentary** states:
**“Manifestation** is called **symbol**,
Thus **symbol** is the **first manifestation** of **things**.
**Heavenly Sovereign** **manifests** from **Thunder** (*zhen* 震),
Thus **Heavenly Sovereign** is the **spirit’s** **response** to **things**.
**Entering** into **non-generation**,
Thus **no form** can be **sought**;
**Falling** into **generation**,
Thus **symbols** are **visible**.

**Things** **take form**, then **symbol** appears.

All **things** **emerge** from **Heavenly Sovereign**,
Then they **emerge** without **refusal**—
All **things** **enter** into **Heavenly Sovereign**,
Then they **enter** without **obstruction**—
**Heavenly Sovereign** **manifests**, then **wondrous things** arise.

**Symbol** is the **portent** of **form**,
**Heavenly Sovereign** is the **exalted** of **things**—
Thus it is the **origin** of all **things**.
Yet **symbol** and **Heavenly Sovereign**,
Once **emerging** from **Dao/Way**,
**Dao/Way** **truly precedes** them.

This is what **Zhuangzi** said:
**“Spirits and Heavenly Sovereigns are spirits of Heavenly Sovereigns,”**
**“Generating Heaven and Earth.”**

**Heaven** **exists** in **Heaven’s** **manifestation** (*tianchengxiang* 天成象),
**Dao/Way** **generates** it—
**Heavenly Sovereign** **manifests** **wondrous things**,
**Dao/Way** **spiritually animates** them—
Then **all** the **ten thousand things** under **Heaven**,
Who **precedes** **Dao/Way**?

Although **Dao/Way** **has no color**,
Thus **visible** yet **not seen**;
**No sound**,
Thus **audible** yet **unheard**;
**No form**,
Thus **seized** yet **not obtained**.

Though it **exists** yet **emerges**,
Its **emergence** **has no source**, **no periphery**—
**No gate** is **visible**,
Who could **know** it?
Thus it is said:
**“I do not know whose child it is.”**

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**

Heaven and Earth are not virtuous—
they treat the ten thousand things as sacrificial dogs.
The sage is not virtuous—
he treats the people as sacrificial dogs.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**
Virtue arises from harm, harm arises from virtue.
If virtue is taken as benevolence, harm follows inevitably.

Heaven and Earth toward the ten thousand things,
the sage toward the people—
they assist their natural unfolding,
with no heart of love or profit.
Virtue cannot be named thus.

Straw bundled as a dog,
used in sacrifices—
when appropriate, it is employed;
when spent, it is discarded.
How could there be room for the heart
in the self-generation of the ten thousand things,
or in the self-governance of the people?

**Explanatory Commentary:**
To love people and benefit things is called *bian* (perverse).
If the heart is set on loving people,
its love is not comprehensive;
if the heart is set on benefiting things,
its benefit is not thorough.
For even when virtue is taken as benevolence,
the heart cannot be entirely absent.

Moreover, the origin of benevolence
always stems from harm,
and the origin of harm
always arises from benevolence.
Where there is harm, benevolence follows;
where there is benevolence, harm ensues—
this is the natural order.

Heaven and Earth have no heart toward the ten thousand things,
the sage has no heart toward the people.
They follow nature without artificial augmentation,
thus loving all without partiality,
benefiting all without exclusion.
Those who receive the gift do not repay,
those who are nourished do not thank—
benefits extend to all ages.
If not for loving people,
how could virtue be named?

Zhuangzi’s *great virtue* is *not virtue*—
just like the sacrificial dog:
Before its use, it is adorned in a wicker basket,
wrapped in embroidered cloth,
and the ritual officiant, in solemn purity, presents it.
Once used, travelers strike its head and spine,
and the poor take it to cook—
and that is all.

How could there be room for the heart
in the self-generation of the ten thousand things,
or in the self-governance of the people?

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like the *tuqiao*?

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**
The *tuqiao* is empty yet receptive,
receptive yet responsive—
thus its response is boundless.
If filled with substance,
it becomes obstructed at every touch.
In the Dao, this is one-sidedness;
in things, this is distortion.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The *tu* can contain,
the *qiao* can resonate—
both are empty yet receptive,
receptive yet responsive.
How could there be exhaustion in responding to sensation?

Between Heaven and Earth,
one *qi* subtly circulates,
pervading without exclusion,
until the limit of demand is reached—
just like the *tuqiao*.
If one thing fills it,
there is no place without obstruction.
How could Heaven and Earth,
vast as they are,
be confined to one-sidedness,
or stagnant in distortion?

Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever emerging.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**
Empty oneself to roam the world,
and one responds broadly yet precisely—
thus, *empty yet unyielding*.
Pressured into action,
one’s capacity is boundless—
thus, *moving yet ever emerging*.
The sage responds to the Sovereign without the burden of words—
this is it.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The vastness of Heaven and Earth—
the sage models himself upon it,
emptying his essence,
yet fully manifesting in his actions.
Returning action to essence,
he remains motionless yet encompasses all things,
tilting none to his advantage,
thus responding universally—
what could be more appropriate?

Arising from essence, his actions are boundless—
having already given all to others,
how could there be exhaustion?
Emptying himself to roam the world,
he acts only when pressed—
thus, his entire life speaks without error,
and his deeds are without artifice.

In responding to the Sovereign,
there is ample reserve.
This is what Zhuangzi called
the Sovereign’s function,
the sage’s remaining task.

Much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to hold the center.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**
The *qiao* is empty, awaiting *qi*—
when *qi* arrives, it sounds;
when *qi* does not come, it is silent.
The sage’s speech is like this.
The sophists’ constraints—
though their speech is much,
they cannot escape entanglement—
better to hold the center than this.

Cultivate your interior,
close your exterior,
retract your gaze, reverse your hearing—
thus returning to see the heart of Heaven and Earth.
This is called *holding the center*.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
All music arises from emptiness.
The *qiao*, as an instrument,
is the origin of pitch, measure, and weight.
Music’s foundation lies here.
Thus the *Odes* speak of “not overstepping the *qiao*,”
meaning *empty to await qi*—
when *qi* arrives, it sounds;
when *qi* does not come, it is silent.

The sage’s speech, when obtained,
resolves resonance to accord with pitch—
responding only when questioned,
never deviating from this.
Thus Confucius desired silence,
and Mencius considered eloquence a reluctant necessity—
this is why.

Those who cannot forget speech,
rambling on to tens of thousands of words,
filling libraries with five chariots of texts—
these are the sophists’ constraints.
Though much, what use is it?

The holder of the center is otherwise:
reaching the truth of things while guarding their root,
commanding their transformation while guarding their origin,
cautious of the exterior without its manifold disputes,
closed to the interior without its thousandfold errors.

The eyes see nothing—
retracting vision,
vision turns to the obscure;
the ears hear nothing—
reversing hearing,
hearing turns to the soundless.
Returning to self-awareness,
the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes plainly visible.
Guard this without loss—
though one speaks not a word all life,
one has never failed to speak.
Why clamor then?

For the center unites above and below—
this is called the *great root of the world*.
Speech cannot exhaust this—
even if one speaks much to exchange it,
better to hold the center.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén Zhāng*)
The Valley Spirit does not die,

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
What has form must have waxing and waning,
what has measure must have completion and decay—
when form and measure are both complete,
life and death are distinguished,
this is the nature of things.

The Valley Spirit receives all movement yet remains ever empty,
the Mysterious Dao manifests all things yet remains ever still.
Within the eternal truth,
it is one with the Way,
not clinging to form,
not entrapped by measure.
Endlessly generating life,
like the sun and moon,
it ceases not through all ages,
like the Southern Dipper,
it never errs through all ages—
thus it is said, *"The Valley Spirit does not die."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
When waxing reaches its peak, it turns to waning;
when waning reaches its extreme, it turns to waxing—
this is true of all that has form.
When completion comes, decay follows swiftly;
when decay comes, completion follows swiftly—
this is true of all that has measure.
Once it has become a thing,
no form or measure can escape it—
this is why all that is born must also perish.
When one yin descends below,
one yang ascends above—
none who remain within yin and yang
can escape this fate.

Yet the Valley Spirit is different.
It receives without accumulating,
responds to all movement yet remains ever empty—
its yin and yang are unfathomable.
It manifests all things yet remains ever still—
within the eternal truth,
it is one with the Way.
It cannot be sought through form,
nor traced through measure—
for form is finite yet this is boundless,
measure is ending yet this is endless.
It transforms beyond all existence,
endlessly generating life—
this is what is meant by *"never having died."*

Like the sun and moon,
it moves onward and returns without ceasing;
like the Southern Dipper,
it revolves southward and northward without error—
how then could one know its end?
This is called the *Dark Mother*.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
All things receive their mandate from the *Non-Existent*,
yet take form in the *Existent*—
the Valley’s function is without likeness,
the Spirit’s essence is without boundary—
this is the mandate from which all things arise.
The *Dark* is the color of Heaven,
the *Mother* is the type of Earth—
this is the form in which all things are completed.

The Valley Spirit and the Dark Mother
illustrate the eternal Way’s constancy,
and the marvelous workings of creation.

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
Continuous without interruption is called *mandate*—
from what does this mandate arise?
It is the Valley Spirit.
When things are born and their principles are established, this is called *mandate*—
what bestows this form?
It is the Dark Mother.
Empty yet skillful in response,
when viewed, no form is seen—
this is the Valley’s function without likeness.
Round yet ever in motion,
when sought, no trace of its origin is known—
this is the Spirit’s essence without boundary.
Here lies the source of all things’ mandate.

Red and black are the *Dark*—
thus the *Yijing* speaks of "Heaven’s Dark and Earth’s Yellow,"
and the *Dark* is the color of Heaven.
Yang is the *Male*, yin is the *Female*—
thus the *Yijing* speaks of "Kūn’s advantage in the *Female* horse’s correctness,"
and the *Female* is the type of Earth.
Here lies the basis of all things’ form.

The Valley Spirit and the Dark Mother—
different names, yet the same reality.
Speaking of its eternal existence,
it is called the Valley Spirit,
to illustrate the eternal Way’s constancy.
Speaking of its generating life,
it is called the Dark Mother,
to reveal creation’s marvelous workings.
Names are contrary,
yet their essence flows in harmony.

The gate of the Dark Mother—
this is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Zhuangzi said:
All things have a source of life yet no one sees its root,
they have a place of emergence yet no one sees its gate—
only the Sage can see it.
Thus here it is made clear:
The gate of the Dark Mother
is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.
Heaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.
Things and Heaven and Earth—
in origin, there is no before or after.
Yet when the great Way’s order is made clear,
there is Heaven and Earth,
and then there are all things.
But the source from which Heaven and Earth emerge—
it is the Dark Mother.
Who could see the One that gave birth before Heaven and Earth?

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
The birth of things—
its emergence has no origin,
thus no one sees its root.
Its coming has no progression,
thus no one sees its gate.
Only the Sage sees what others do not see,
and perceives the unseen form—
the self-originating, self-rooted,
yet the gate through which all marvels pass.
Knowing it as one sees,
it is directly pointed to its fundamental essence,
and declared: *"The gate of the Dark Mother—
this is called the Root of Heaven and Earth."*
This is what Zhuangzi meant when he said:
All things have a source of life yet no one sees its root,
they have a place of emergence yet no one sees its gate.

Moreover, Heaven opens above,
Earth opens below,
and humans dwell within—
thus Heaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.
Heaven and Earth are born with me,
all things are one with me—
how then could one observe things and Heaven and Earth as prior or subsequent?
There is Heaven and Earth,
and then there are all things—
this is merely the sequence of the Way.

The source from which Heaven and Earth emerge—
it is called the Dark Mother—
then who could see the One that gave birth before Heaven and Earth?

Endless, as if eternally present,
its use requires no effort.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Self-originating, self-rooted,
it has existed since ancient times—
the transmission of fire knows no end.
This is what is meant by *"endless, as if eternally present."*

When things are born, it is Heaven’s work,
leaving the single *qi* to move on its own—
when Earth transforms, it is swift,
entrusting all forms to their own proliferation—
the *Yijing*’s *Qian* is easily understood,
the *Yijing*’s *Kūn* is simple in ability—
not by force, but how could there be effort?

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*Endless*—this means unceasing.
*As if eternally present*—this means not perishing.
The Classic speaks of *"deep and vast, as if there might be a few traces remaining"*—
this is it.
The utmost of the Way,
before Heaven and Earth yet without beginning,
after Heaven and Earth yet without end—
it seems to perish yet remains,
and can be said to have existed since ancient times.
Like the transmission of fire,
it relies on fuel to illuminate,
and when the green is consumed, it returns to the fuel—
though it ends, it never truly ends.
This is what is meant by *"endless, as if eternally present."*

Yet Heaven is merely the accumulation of *qi*—
the beginning from which all things draw their resources.
But Heaven’s creation of things
leaves the single *qi* to move on its own—
it does not exert force to create them.
Earth is merely the accumulation of form—
the basis from which all things draw their growth.
Yet Earth’s transformation of things
entrusts all forms to their own proliferation—
it does not use power to change them.

**Great is the Primordial of Heaven (乾元),**
by its ease we come to know it;
**Profound is the Primordial of Earth (坤元),**
by its simplicity it achieves all.
Its wondrous functions are complete—
no contrivance is needed,
naturally so—
what labor is there?

**Chapter Seven: Heaven’s Longevity and Earth’s Endurance (天长地久)**
Heaven and Earth endure long because
they do not generate themselves—
thus they endure forever.

**Commentary by Emperor Huizong (徽宗注):**
The vault of Heaven arches above,
with the Sun and Moon as its longitudinal threads,
and stars as its latitudinal weaves—
and all things are sheltered beneath it.
The Earth is solid and square below,
forming mountains and valleys,
merging into rivers and lakes—
and all things rest upon it.

All things are sheltered and borne by Heaven and Earth,
yet Heaven and Earth hold no intention toward them—
thus Heaven moves with steadfast certainty,
and Earth remains with unyielding stability—
this is how they endure long.

If Heaven and Earth were to harbor intent toward life,
then Heaven would soon be measured,
its sheltering shallow,
and Earth would soon be fathomed,
its bearing thin.
Thus would they depend on others—
how could they then endure?

**Explanatory Notes (疏义):**
Light and pure is Heaven, round and in motion,
so its form arches above.
Heavy and turbid is Earth, square and at rest,
so its form is solid below.
Heaven’s *qi* ascends—
the Sun and Moon, the stars—
all are accumulations of *qi* in Heaven,
and all beneath the sky are what it shelters.
Earth’s forms settle—
mountains and rivers—
all are accumulations of form in Earth,
and all upon the land are what it bears.

Heaven shelters without partiality,
Earth bears without favor—
Heaven and Earth hold no intent toward all things.
Thus, with effortless ease, their motion never ceases,
and with simple steadfastness, their stance never falters—
this is how Heaven and Earth endure long.

If one were to rely on contrivance,
depend on cleverness,
and carve or chisel mere grains of matter—
this would be to harbor intent toward life.
How could such labor compare to the divine efficacy of Heaven and Earth?
Surely it would be shallow and insufficient in its sheltering and bearing.
Thus would it depend on others—
what choice would it have with things?

Only by not generating itself,
and abiding in the realm of non-generation,
can it endure forever.

Therefore, the Sage places his own self last,
yet his self comes first;
sets his self aside,
yet his self is preserved.

**Commentary by Emperor Huizong (徽宗注):**
Heaven moves above, Earth rests below,
and the Sage dwells between them.
As *San Cai* (三才)—Heaven, Earth, and Sage—
their functions are mutually resonant.
As *San Ji* (三极)—three poles—
their forms stand distinct.
As *San Ling* (三灵)—three spirits—
their divine mystery knows no separation.

Thus, Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all attain the Dao,
and the Sage’s cultivation of his self
is already that of Heaven and Earth.
Hence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth’s non-generation,
then follows with the Sage’s non-possession of his self.

All take precedence—
only the Sage takes last,
saying, *"I receive the filth of the world"*—
this is called placing his self last.
By placing his self last,
he does not contend with things,
and thus none can contend with him—
hence, *"placing his self last, his self comes first."*

On the path, he does not vie for advantage in peril or ease;
in winter and summer, he does not cling to the harmony of yin and yang;
he transcends life and death,
sets aside fortune and calamity—
yet his spirit is never constrained—
this is called setting his self aside, yet his self is preserved.

Thus is the Sage’s cultivation of his self—
how much more so for matters beyond the self?
He encounters without resisting,
passes without clinging,
embracing nature’s essence and nurturing the spirit,
to wander between the world’s affairs.
His form will naturally align,
self and things become one—
born before Heaven and Earth yet not enduring,
longer than ancient times yet not aging—
this is its effect.

**Explanatory Notes (疏义):**
Heaven’s duty is to generate and shelter—
thus it moves above.
Earth’s duty is to form and bear—
thus it rests below.
The Sage’s duty is to teach and transform—
thus he dwells between Heaven and Earth.

Their functions are mutually resonant—
hence called *San Cai*.
Their forms stand distinct—
hence called *San Ji*.
Their spirits are inseparable—
hence called *San Ling*.
Thus, observing Heaven, Earth, and the Sage,
though their paths differ, their Dao is one.

The Sage’s cultivation of his self
need not be sought elsewhere—
it is evident in Heaven and Earth.
Hence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth,
then follows with the Sage.

For not generating itself is to forget generation,
not possessing the self is to forget the self—
forgetting generation, yet enduring;
forgetting the self, yet the self is preserved—
this is how Heaven and Earth are Heaven and Earth,
how the Sage is the Sage.

Since others take precedence,
the Sage alone takes last—
as the Classic says, *"To be first among men,
one must place his self last."*
Rivers and lakes accept filth,
rulers bear the nation’s shame—
thus, *"receiving the world’s filth"*—
the Classic says, *"receiving the nation’s filth,
this is the duty of the sovereign."*
All these are acts of placing his self last—
only by placing his self last
does he embody yielding, weakness, and humility,
and not contend with things.
Only by not contending
does he empty himself to wander in the world—
who could harm him?
Thus, none can contend with him—
this is the way of *"placing his self last, yet his self comes first."*

To walk with haste—
not avoiding peril or ease in rivers and valleys—
this is what others contend for,
yet he does not vie for advantage in peril or ease on the path.
To seek warmth and shun cold—
this is natural harmony of yin and yang,
yet he does not cling to it in winter and summer.
To delight in life and fear death,
to seek fortune and avoid calamity—
this is human nature,
yet he transcends life and death,
sets aside fortune and calamity.

This has no other secret—
knowing that the body is not mine to possess,
while the four limbs and myriad bones will soon become dust and filth,
thus he can be in perfect harmony with all things,
and not cling to his own body.

If so, then he houses the myriad bones as mere forms of ears and eyes,
while his spirit is never burdened or constrained—
what thing could harm him?
This is what is meant by *"transcending his body yet his body remains."*

No one values his own body more than its own worth—
the Sage governs it thus,
how much more so for external matters?
When they come, he does not resist them,
knowing that their arrival cannot be prevented;
when they pass, he does not cling to them,
knowing that their departure cannot be stopped.
He does not burden himself with form,
while his true nature embraces the spirit,
and he wanders among people as their equal,
through the world of the mundane.

Form will naturally align itself,
and things and self become one—
to live long and see far,
and to endure alongside Heaven and Earth,
then to be born before Heaven and Earth,
and not to be aged by longevity,
what could be more difficult?
Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he can fulfill his own true nature.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is called ‘life’ (生),
and the greatest treasure of the Sage is called ‘position’ (位).
The Dao/Way makes them public—
Heaven and Earth embody the Dao/Way,
thus they have no selfishness,
and no selfishness brings enduring longevity.
The Sage embodies the Dao/Way,
thus he has no selfishness,
and no selfishness ensures his eternal existence.
To cultivate oneself for selfish gain—
none have succeeded in fulfilling their selfishness.
The *Commentary* states:
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all forms,
their difference from myriad things lies in their enduring longevity.
The Sage’s distinction from the common folk lies in his eternal existence.
The *Book of Changes* (《易》) says:
‘The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life,
and the greatest treasure of the Sage is called position.
Heaven and Earth thus give birth and endure,
the Sage thus preserves his position and remains eternal,
all because of their lack of selfishness.’

To obstruct the Dao/Way with selfishness—
one cannot attain the Dao/Way.
The Dao/Way makes all things public,
and one can only be without selfishness
by embodying the Dao/Way.
Han Feizi says:
‘To cultivate oneself for selfish gain is selfishness,
to abandon selfishness for the public is virtue.
Since the body does not generate itself,
and one transcends his own body,
how could he cultivate for selfishness?
The means by which he attains enduring longevity and bodily preservation—
this is what is meant by *fulfilling his own true nature*.

Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water
From the section *"The Supreme Good is Like Water"* (上善若水)

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*The Classic of Changes* says: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way; what follows it is virtue.”
Zhuangzi says: “To depart from the Dao/Way for the sake of virtue—once the name of virtue is established, the very body of the Dao/Way is impaired.”

Yet, Heaven’s One generates Water, and though it departs slightly from the Dao/Way, its depths are vast and empty, its stillness clear—this is called the utmost refinement under Heaven. Hence, *the Supreme Good is like Water*.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Yin and yang are the great movements of *qi*.
From the perspective of *qi* before it manifests, it is neither yin nor yang—this is the Dao/Way.
All things bear yin within and embrace yang; from their operation in the myriad things, it is said that they do not depart from yin and yang—this too is the Dao/Way.
*The Classic of Changes* says: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way”—this is merely speaking of things.
Descending from the Dao/Way, what humans desire most is virtue, and so it is said that what follows the Dao/Way is virtue.
Since the Dao/Way is singular, once it is called virtue, it is divided from the Dao/Way.
Their division is their succession, hence Zhuangzi says: “To depart from the Dao/Way for the sake of virtue.”
For once the name of virtue is established, the undivided whole is split, and the body of the Dao/Way is impaired.

Yet, the Nine Categories begin with the Five Phases, and the Five Phases prioritize Water—thus, Heaven’s One generates Water, though it departs slightly from the Dao/Way.
Though it overflows, it does not lose its measure—it is deep and empty.
When clarified, it reveals even the finest hairs; when still, it is luminous.
What under Heaven is more refined than this? And so, *the Supreme Good is like Water*—unlike those who merely know virtue as virtue.

Water is good at benefiting all things without contention,
dwelling where all detest it—
thus it approaches the Dao/Way.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
When it melts, it becomes rain and dew, nourishing all;
when it congeals, it becomes frost and snow, shaping all.
When dispersed, it becomes rivers and streams; when gathered, it forms lakes and marshes.
Deep as springs, vast as seas—it is drawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.
It generates and nourishes all things, yet never exhausts them.
Who benefits all things better than this?

Its beneficence to all things—
in Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;
on Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.
Yet its nature is yielding and weak,
always dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,
not seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—
thus it approaches the Dao/Way.
*Ji* means “near.”

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Heaven’s One generates Water, flowing without end.
In Heaven, when yang-*qi* prevails, it melts into rain and dew,
spreading to nourish all things, thus all are nourished.
When yin-*qi* prevails, it congeals into frost and snow,
engraving to complete all things, thus all treasures are formed.
On Earth, it disperses as rivers and streams,
gathers as lakes and marshes;
its encompassing return to wholeness is the depth of springs—
when measured, its end is unseen—
the vastness of seas—
drawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.
Its generation and nourishment are inexhaustible;
all things rely on it without depletion,
taking as they need, given as they require—
who benefits all things better than this?

Its beneficence to all things—
in Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;
on Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.
Yet its nature is yielding and weak,
always dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,
not seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—
thus it approaches the Dao/Way.
*Ji* is the subtle beginning of movement—
*ji* means “near,” for it is the movement before reaching its destination.
To approach the Dao/Way is to be near the Dao/Way.

**Residing in the good of place,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
It flows through the earth, yet never overflows.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Water is called “moistening the low”—
thus it moves through the earth.
It fills the depressions before advancing—
thus it flows without overflowing.

**The mind is good at depth,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
The deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;
the farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
A thousand *ren* of height is insufficient to fathom its depth—
the deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;
a thousand *li* of breadth is insufficient to contain its vastness—
the farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.

**To act with goodness is to be benevolent,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
It loves all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Wherever frost and dew fall, there is no far or near—
all under Heaven is encompassed by its blessings,
truly loving all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.

**To speak with goodness is to be trustworthy,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
It avoids obstacles to reach the seas,
traverses dangers without losing its course.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
It studies the sea and arrives at the sea—
this is to avoid obstacles to reach the seas.
Though it twists a myriad times, it must return to the east—
this is to traverse dangers without losing its course.

**To govern with goodness is to bring order,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
It cleanses the impure, smooths the perilous,
following the natural course of things, without contrivance—
thus nothing remains ungoverned.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
By its ebb and flow, it attains purity—
thus it cleanses the impure.
Its measure is even and balanced—
thus it smooths the perilous.
If it follows its natural course,
there is no contrivance of the heart.
Thus, though it appears undirected,
nothing remains ungoverned.

**To act with goodness is to be capable,**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
It adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths,
conforms to vessels to become round and square,
its changes are ever-varying yet ever-constant—
who is as capable as this?

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Its flow follows natural paths—
thus it adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths.
It responds as taken—
thus it conforms to vessels to become round and square.
It can be struck to rise above the forehead,
or stirred to fill the mountains—
yet its balance is ever-true,
and the master craftsman takes it as his model.
Its changes are ever-varying,
yet ever-constant in balance—
who is as capable as this?

**To move with goodness is to act in season.***
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
When yang releases it, it becomes mist;
when yin congeals it, it becomes ice.
In the east, it gathers as streams;
in the west, it flows westward—
its movement is unrestrained,
proper only to the seasons.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
When the season is spring, yang-qi rises from below,
and ice melts into water—
yang releases it, making it flow.
When the season is winter, yin-qi reaches its peak,
and water congeals into ice—
yin congeals it, making it solid.
It does not stagnate in one corner,
nor cling to one curve.
In the east, it flows eastward;
in the west, it flows westward—
moving with things, unrestrained,
proper only to the seasons.

Only the non-contending thus has no blame.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
The Sage embodies the Dao to govern himself,
and thus endures eternally.
He embraces all goodness to benefit beings,
dwelling in the non-contending.

Zhuangzi says:
*"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?"*
To act rashly is contrary to Heaven’s will.
To act without effort and yet commit few faults—this is easy;
to act with effort and yet never rest—this is difficult.
If one seeks to benefit beings through action,
then avoiding blame becomes difficult.

The highest goodness benefits beings,
like water’s nature—
though it benefits all without discrimination,
it does not contend with things,
and thus nothing can contend with it—
hence, no blame.

Thus it is said:
*"Under Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,
yet none can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
The Sage responds to the world—
in his self-cultivation, he embodies the Dao within,
thus governing himself with enduring permanence,
equal to Heaven and Earth.
In his actions toward others, he embraces all goodness,
thus benefiting beings.
Dwelling in the non-contending,
his movement is like water’s.

Zhuangzi says:
*"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?"*
To act rashly is contrary to Heaven’s will.
The gentleman, before taking action,
first purifies himself to refine his virtue—
thus, action cannot be rash.
To act without effort and yet commit few faults—this is easy;
to act with effort and yet never rest—this is difficult.
If one makes benefiting beings his purpose,
then he cannot avoid action,
and thus avoiding blame becomes difficult.

Moreover, it is improper to favor the upper over the lower,
or the left over the right—
all these lead to blame.
Only the highest goodness benefits beings,
like water’s nature—
extending and contracting without left or right,
benefiting all without discrimination,
not contending while nothing can contend with it—
in all transformations, ever one,
nothing can overcome it—
hence, no blame.

This aligns with the *Classic*’s saying:
*"Under Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,
yet none can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong."*

**Chapter Nine: "Holding Fullness"**
To hold fullness to the brim
is not as good as stopping in time.
To sharpen to a point
cannot be long preserved.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Fullness overflows;
sharpness dulls—
this is the nature of all things.
Fullness must have its loss;
to not know how to hold back in advance,
to grasp emptiness while governing fullness,
and to indulge in the desire for fullness—
this only increases the risk of ruin.
Thus, it is better to stop in time.

Things’ transformations are boundless,
yet human wisdom is limited.
Preemptive foresight is the flower of the Dao,
the beginning of folly.

To probe things’ nature and yet rush forward—
wisdom will falter in time.
How can it be long preserved?

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Things have fixed measures—
thus, fullness overflows,
and sharpness dulls—
fullness must have its loss;
this is the nature of all things.
If one does not wield the adaptable power of compliance,
hold back in advance,
or grasp the handle of humility to govern fullness—
if one indulges in the transformations of growth and decay,
changing with the times,
and yet drowns in the desire for fullness—
this only increases the risk of ruin.
Thus, to hold fullness to the brim
is not as good as stopping in time.

The *Transmission* says:
*"Those who embody the Dao can hold fullness without tipping."*

Indeed, this is different.
To face myriad movements with one body,
to shoulder ten thousand affairs with one mind—
to exhaust one’s clarity and wisdom in response—
this will inevitably lead to exhaustion.
Though one’s foresight may be keen,
it may still fail to address all circumstances,
for things’ transformations are boundless while human wisdom is limited.

To wear out one’s spirit in reckless speculation—
this is called preemptive foresight.
Preemptive foresight leads to clinging to trifles while forgetting the root,
laboring the mind until it grows dull—
this is called the flower of the Dao,
the beginning of folly.

To use wisdom as a chisel,
probing things’ nature and yet rushing forward—
wisdom will falter in time.
Even if gained, it will be lost—
how can it be long preserved?

The *Transmission* says:
*"Those who embody the Dao rest without exhaustion,
while those who rely on schemes labor without success."*
Is this not so?

Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them.
Riches and honor breed arrogance,
and thus invite their own ruin.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Gold, jade, riches, and honor
are not the essence of life and death—
they are external things one cannot rely upon.
To treasure gold and jade is to be burdened by things.
If burdened by things, how can one avoid loss?
Thus, none can guard them.
Riches and honor breed arrogance,
and thus harm one’s virtue.
If virtue is harmed, how can one avoid ruin?
Thus, one invites blame upon oneself.

The Sage does not cling to the world’s transient gains as his own,
nor does he seek dominion over all as his own display.
How could gold and jade be treasured,
or riches and honor be burdensome?

Thus, in the most prosperous of states,
wealth and honors converge—
its nobility is unmatched,
its riches unparalleled—
yet the Dao remains unchanged.

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
Within the realm of self-cultivation, nothing is untrue;
outside it, nothing is unfalse.
Gold, jade, riches, and honor are external things,
not the essence of life and death.
External things cannot be relied upon—
gain and loss follow in turn.
Thus, they are not things one can possess.

What is treasured within oneself
exists everywhere;
what is treasured in things
is lost as soon as gained.
To treasure gold and jade is to be burdened by things—
when things depart, how can one avoid loss?

Thus, none can truly hold onto it.

Wealth and honor with humility—this is the virtue of the noble.
Arrogance, licentiousness, and boastfulness—these lead to ruin.
Wealth and honor with arrogance harm one’s virtue;
harming virtue is what people reject—how could one avoid misfortune?
Thus, one invites one’s own blame.

The Sage does not cling to the benefits of a single age as his private gain,
but rejoices in shared prosperity;
nor does he seek dominion over all as his own display,
but finds joy in the Way and forgets worldly power.

Is it not the case that precious goods like gold and jade are not true treasures,
that fame and profit are not the heart’s desire,
and that wealth and honor are burdensome?

Thus, all ten thousand things are complete within oneself—
in the most prosperous of states, wealth and resources converge—
yet the riches of Jin and Chu are not what is meant by true wealth.
To govern all things, surpassing all others—
in the most noble of states, rank and honor converge—
yet the nobility of Zhao and Meng is not what is meant by true nobility.
Its nobility is unmatched, its riches unparalleled,
eternal through ages past and present—
thus, the Dao remains unchanged.

When achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled,
one withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.

The *Commentary of Emperor Huizong* says:
When achievement is complete, it decays;
when reputation is fulfilled, it falters.
As the sun reaches its zenith, it declines;
as the moon is full, it wanes—
this is the nature of things.
The Sage perceives how completion and decay follow one another,
recognizes the cycles of fullness and emptiness,
rises above all things with ease,
unburdened by external things,
free from the perils of arrogance and excess—
this is true wisdom.
Who else can match this understanding?
Thus it is said: *When achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.*

The cycles of the four seasons—
when achievement is complete, it departs—
this is the Way of Heaven.
If one knows how to advance but not retreat,
if one knows how to preserve but not perish,
if one knows how to gain but not lose—
how could one avoid regret?

Yi Yin said:
*"I do not dwell on favor and profit at the height of success."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
When achievement reaches its peak, it is destined to decline;
when reputation is perfected, it is destined to falter.
Gazing upward at the heavens,
the sun governs the yang, the moon the yin—
yet even the sun and moon have their eclipses.
How much more so the fleeting fortunes of worldly success and fame?

The Sage comprehends the principles of all things,
knows that completion is swiftly followed by decay,
sees how completion and decay are interdependent,
understands the cycles of fullness and emptiness,
and their inevitable order.
Not clinging to what others possess,
he finds true fulfillment within himself,
unburdened by external things,
unconstrained by them,
modest yet receptive, balanced yet complete,
free from the breath of arrogance and excess,
harmonizing with the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness,
moving with the times.
Viewing wealth and honor as fleeting shadows passing by,
or as gnats before one’s face—
how could they be burdensome?

Who else, if not the knower of Heaven, could attain this?
Thus it is said: *When achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.*

Now, when *Wu* emerges, *Jing* retreats;
when *Jia* flourishes, *Gui* declines—
the cycles of the four seasons—
when achievement is complete, it departs—
this is the Way of Heaven.

If one knows how to advance but not retreat,
endlessly pursuing progress;
if one knows how to preserve but not perish,
clinging to existence without adaptation;
if one knows how to gain but not lose,
fearing loss after acquisition—
how could one avoid regret?

Yi Yin said:
*"I do not dwell on favor and profit at the height of success."*

Indeed, to dwell is to invite departure—
when achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—
thus, by not dwelling, one does not depart.
Those who uphold this principle should reflect deeply upon it.

**Chapter Ten: On the Nourishment of the *Pò* (魄)**

Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*Pò* is the Yin aspect—
it adheres to the body and finds its resting place,
hence the Master Lao spoke of the *Pò* as **nourishment** (營).
*The Hun* (魂) is the Yang aspect—
it rides upon the *qi* and knows no obstruction,
hence the *Yì* (易) spoke of the *Hun* as **wandering** (游).
The Sage governs form with the *Shén* (神),
and controls *Pò* with the *Hun* (魂);
thus, the *Shén* always **nourishes** (載) *Pò* but is never **nourished** by it—
like a chariot’s movement, carrying all things within it,
like the passage of time, where cold and heat succeed one another.
With **heavenly wandering** (天游) in the heart,
the six *Chè* (彻) mutually interpenetrate—
transcending Heaven and Earth,
leaving all things behind,
yet the *Shén* is never constrained—
how much less could it be **obstructed** by *Pò*?

The *Cūnyì* (疏義) states:
*Pò* is born from **color** (色)—
its character is composed of *bái* (白).
*Bái* is the Yin hue.
If it enters without transformation,
knowing no obstruction,
then it adheres to the body and finds its resting place—
hence the Master Lao spoke of the *Pò* as **nourishment**.
**Nourishment** implies a resting place.
*The Hun* (魂) is the domain of *qi*—
its character is composed of *yún* (云).
*Yún* is the Yang *qi*.
If it moves in and out, dispersing and gathering,
while the *Shén* responds to it,
then it rides upon the *qi* and knows no obstruction—
hence the *Yì* spoke of the *Hun* as **wandering**.
**Wandering** implies no obstruction.

The Sage governs form with the *Shén*,
not allowing the *Shén* to be burdened by the form;
and controls *Pò* with the *Hun*,
not allowing the *Hun* to be confined by *Pò*.
Thus, the *Shén* always **nourishes** *Pò* but is never **nourished** by it—
like a chariot’s movement, carrying all things within it,
unspoiled in its core,
like the passage of time, where cold and heat succeed one another,
and all beings ride upon it.

With **heavenly wandering** in the heart,
one rises above the mundane and transcends the dust of the world,
yet fully encompasses the body—
this differs from those who restrict themselves to a narrow dwelling.
The six *Chè* (彻) mutually interpenetrate—
from the *Chè* of the eyes to the *Chè* of wisdom,
filling all without boundary—
this differs from the six *Záo* (凿) that repel one another.
Knowing that Heaven and Earth were born with me yet able to transcend them,
knowing that all things share existence with me yet able to leave them behind,
entering and exiting the six *Hé* (合),
spanning and weaving all directions,
yet the *Shén* is never constrained—
how much less could it be confined by form and **obstructed** by *Pò*?

Can one who **embraces Unity** (抱一) avoid separation?

Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
**Heaven’s Unity** (天一) generates water,
which in things is **Essence** (精).
**Earth’s Two** (地二) generates fire,
which in things is **Spirit** (神).
**Spirit** and **Essence** arise from the Dao,
the form is born from **Essence**,
and if one guards them without loss,
they align with **Spirit**—
then **Essence** and **Spirit** merge without separation.
With **Essence** gathering **Spirit**,
with **Spirit** animating the form,
and with the form preserving **Spirit**,
**Essence** is complete without depletion,
**Spirit** functions without exhaustion,
and the form lives without decay—
like the sun and moon adorning the sky,
like grasses and trees adorning the earth,
they never part.

I have often expounded this:
When a person is born,
**Essence** gathers **Spirit**,
and the bodily form is thus complete.
The fourfold flow spreads and converges,
reaching all extremes—
above it meets Heaven,
below it coils with Earth,
transforming and nurturing all things,
beyond any likeness—
this is called **Emperor-like** (同帝).
Yet the foolish of the world
enslave themselves to things,
lose their nature in worldly affairs,
and in no moment of rest
preserve **Spirit** within.
They chase endless desires,
abandon **Essence** externally,
and the *Hun* follows *Pò*,
while the form burdens **Spirit**—
thus they descend with all things into transformation,
is this not bewilderment?

The Sage is not so.
**Nourishing** *Pò* to harmonize,
**embracing Unity** to guard,
**preserving** **Spirit** to stillness—
then the form will naturally rectify itself.
Its **Spirit** rests in the **Great Mountain** (太山) yet does not change,
dwells in the **Deep Springs** (渊泉) yet is not dampened—
who knows its origin?
Who knows its end?
Hence it is said: *The Sage values **Essence**.*

The *Cūnyì* states:
The Dao generates **Unity** (一),
and **Unity** is water—
hence **Heaven’s Unity** generates water,
which in things is **Essence**.
**Unity** generates **Two** (二),
and **Two** is fire—
hence **Earth’s Two** generates fire,
which in things is **Spirit**.
All things possess *qi*,
and **Spirit** and **Essence** are the primal source of *qi*;
all things possess **numbers** (數),
and **Spirit** and **Essence** precede the manifestation of **numbers**.
Thus, **Spirit** and **Essence** arise from the Dao—
because the **illuminating** (昭昭) is generated from the **obscure** (冥冥).

Heaven and Earth contain **Essence**,
and all things are transformed and born—
the four seasons disperse **Essence** to become all things,
and thus the form is born from **Essence**—
because the **ordered** (有倫) is generated from the **formless** (無形).

If one **embraces Unity** (抱一) without detachment,
guards them without loss,
then **Spirit** is grasped and steadfast,
aligning with **Spirit**—
hence **Essence** and **Spirit** merge without separation,
because the **ultimate Essence** of the world can merge with the **ultimate Spirit** of the world.

With **Essence** gathering **Spirit**,
and **Spirit** not shaken by **Essence**,
then **Essence** is complete without depletion.
With **Spirit** animating the form,
and **Spirit** embraced in stillness,
then **Spirit** functions without exhaustion.
With the form preserving **Spirit**,
and **Spirit** guarding the form,
then the form lives without decay.
**Essence** complete and **Spirit** complete,
**Spirit** complete and the form complete—
like the sun and moon adorning the sky yet enduringly shining,
like grasses and trees adorning the earth yet enduringly standing,
they never part.

Moreover, when a person is born,
**Essence** is the root of the body—
when **Essence** is complete, **Spirit** follows,
thus **Essence** gathers **Spirit** and the bodily form is complete.
**Essence** emerges from the **ultimate Yin** (至阴),
**Spirit** from the **ultimate Yang** (至阳).
The Yin **Essence** is water,
the Yang **Spirit** is fire.
Water and fire originally have no form—
when sought with the **balance scale** (镒) and **fire drill** (燧),
they naturally arise,
and thus it is known that **Spirit** and **Essence** flow fourfold and converge—
reaching all extremes.

The **ultimate Yin** is solemn and still,
the **ultimate Yang** is radiant and vast—
when the two intermingle in harmony,
things are born,
and thus my body and Heaven and Earth share the same root.
Therefore, it is fitting that above it meets Heaven,
below it coils with Earth,
transforming and nurturing all things—
this is called **Emperor-like**.
Yet the great fools of the world,
throughout their lives, remain unenlightened—
heavy on externals, light on internals,
their wills chasing ends, abandoning roots,
enslaving themselves to things,
losing their nature in worldly affairs,
their hearts restless and never still,
unable to even pause for a moment—
no moment of rest to preserve **Spirit** within,
exhausted by endless desires,
they do not know where their **Spirit** returns,
abandon **Essence** externally,
and cannot gather **Essence** to contain the *Hun*—
the *Hun* follows *Pò*,
they cannot govern the form with **Spirit**,
the form burdens **Spirit**—
unable to distinguish themselves from things,
they descend with all things into transformation—
is this not bewilderment?

The Sage does not act thus.
He aligns the *Pò* with **Spirit** to manifest **Way** and resonate with **Virtue**,
embraces the **One** to preserve **Stillness** and thus attune with the **Dao**.

With neither sight nor hearing,
he alone guards **Spirit**—
and by embracing **Spirit** in **Stillness**,
he does not diminish its essence.
Cautiously guarding his form,
his body naturally rectifies itself.

His **Spirit** flows through **Great Void** without alteration,
its vastness unbounded;
dwells in **Deep Source** without dampness,
its subtlety unconfined.

Approach it, and you see no beginning—
who can trace its origin?
Follow it, and you find no end—
who can grasp its conclusion?
All stems from the **One’s** pure penetration.

Thus **Zhuangzi** said:
*"The Sage focuses on **Essence**."*
**Shun’s** admonition to **Yu** declared:
*"Focus only on **Essence**, focus only on the **One**."*
Did he know this truth?

Can you concentrate **Qi** to achieve **Softness**,
like the innocence of an infant?

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"The **Yijing** says: **Qian** [乾], in its **Stillness**, is absolute in focus."*

**Yang Xiong** declared:
*"Harmonious **Softness** suffices to settle all things."*

**Stillness** without distraction is called **focused**,
**Harmony** without excess is called **soft**.
An infant, in repose, knows not what to do,
in motion, knows not where to go,
harbors neither judgment of right and wrong
nor taste for good and evil—
thus his **Qi** is concentrated,
achieving **Softness**.

**Mencius** said:
*"The faltering and rushing—
this is **Qi**,
yet it disrupts the heart."*

If the heart cannot focus **Qi**,
then **Qi** falters and rushes unnaturally,
and the heart grows **arrogant and unchecked**—
unable to be contained.

The Sage empties himself to engage the world,
his heart free from forcing **Qi**—
thus his **Stillness** remains undistracted,
his **Harmony** unexcessive—
what difference lies between him and an infant?
Hence it is said: *"Can you be like an infant?"*

**Mencius** also said:
*"When **Qi** is at its utmost vast and firm,
nourished upright without harm,
it fills the space between Heaven and Earth."*

Yet **Laozi** spoke of concentrating **Qi** to achieve **Softness**—
why so?

Utmost **Firmness** aligns with **Righteousness**,
**Softness** returns to **Nature**—
ancient **Dao/Way** and its techniques
are nowhere absent.

The **Annotations** state:
*"The **Yijing**, in the **Xìcí** [系辞], says:
**Qian** [乾], in its **Stillness**, is absolute in focus.*
*Its focus comes from **Stillness**—
thus **focused** means **Stillness** without clinging.*

*Yang Xiong, in the **Tàixuān** [太玄], says:
**Harmonious Softness** suffices to settle all things.*
*Its **Softness** settles all things through **Harmony**—
thus **soft** means **Harmony** without excess.*

Moreover, in human life within the **Great Transformation** [大化], there are four stages:
In infancy, before thoughts take form,
his repose is not from intent to still—
thus he rests without knowing what to do.
His motion is not from intent to act—
thus he moves without knowing where to go.
Following **Nature** and yielding to **Principle**,
free from contrivance,
he harbors neither judgment of right and wrong
nor taste for good and evil—
thus his **Qi** is **Stillness** without distraction,
capable of **Softness** without excess.

Indeed, **Will** commands **Qi** like a general,
a unified **Will** suffices to move **Qi**.
**Mencius** said:
*"The faltering and rushing—
this is **Qi**,
yet it disrupts the heart."*

Thus, concentrating **Qi** originates from the heart’s **One** and unchanging nature.
If **One** and unchanging,
then all things cannot sway the heart,
and **Qi** naturally concentrates.

If the heart fails to focus **Qi**,
then **Qi** falters and rushes unnaturally,
and the heart grows **arrogant and unchecked**—
unable to be contained.
This is like a strong beam
not bending to avoid death—
how can it remain like an infant?

The Sage empties himself to wander through the world,
and when adversity comes,
he regards it as a **hollow boat** drifting on **floating tiles**,
thus able to preserve **Softness**.
His heart, free from forcing **Qi**,
what difference lies between him and an infant?

**Mencius** said:
*"When **Qi** is at its utmost vast and firm,
nourished upright without harm,
it fills the space between Heaven and Earth."*

Yet **Laozi** spoke of concentrating **Qi** to achieve **Softness**—
why so?

Utmost **Vastness** aligns with the **Dao/Way**,
utmost **Firmness** aligns with **Righteousness**.
**Mencius** spoke of utmost **Firmness**,
emphasizing **action in Righteousness**,
discussing **Qi’s** application.
**Laozi** spoke of **Softness**,
emphasizing **return to Nature**,
discussing **Qi’s** root.

If **Guan Yin** [关尹] takes its **pure Qi** [纯气],
and **Huzi** [壶子] takes its **balanced Qi** [衡气],
their words each hold truth—
thus it is.

The ancient spread of the **Dao/Way**,
nowhere absent—
this is why.

**Purification** and **profound insight**,
can they be without flaw?

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"The Sage uses this to cleanse the heart,
thus purifying all actions without attachment.
He uses this to retreat and hide in **secrecy** [密],
thus gazing into **mysteries** and recognizing **principles** in silence."*

If such is the case,
his **body** remains **pure and simple** without burden,
his errors pass without regret,
his actions align without self-congratulation—
what flaw could there be?

The **Annotations** state:
*"The ancients held that before **things** began to exist was **unattained** [未至],
and only when reaching **before things began to exist** [未始有物]
was it **attained**—
thus **purification** of all actions without attachment.
Using this to cleanse the heart,
who could have even a hair’s breadth of disturbance?
That which has **words** and **nearness** is not **true** [真],
and only when reaching **forgetting words and ceasing contrivance** [忘言息迩]
is it **true**—
thus **profound insight** into **mysteries** and recognizing **principles** in silence.
Using this to retreat and hide in **secrecy**,
who could have **words** to burden him?
If such is the case,
his **body** remains **pure and simple** without burden,
unmixed with anything, undiminished.
His **Spirit** rides the **times** [时] to act,
though errors occur,
in **times** he cannot avoid them—
thus errors pass without regret.
Following **principles** to move,
his alignment is inevitable—
in **principles** he cannot avoid it—
thus actions align without self-congratulation.
What flaw could there be?"

To love the people and govern the realm,
can one be without **action** [为]?

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"With **benevolence** [仁] to love the people,
with **wisdom** [智] to govern the realm,
spreading **teaching** and **refining laws**,
to unify the world with **goodness**—
how difficult is this in terms of **non-action** [无为]!

The Sage’s benefit and nourishment extend to all ages,
not from loving the people.
His **achievements** overshadow the world,
yet he does not claim them—
thus **non-action**,
using the world while having abundance."

The **Annotations** state:
*"Loving people and benefiting things is called **benevolence**,
using **benevolence** to love the people
brings forth a heart of love and benefit.
Right and wrong, near and far is called **wisdom**,
using **wisdom** to govern the realm
brings forth a heart of right and wrong."*

Though teaching and cultivation cannot be abandoned,
and refining laws cannot be halted,
to unify the world through goodness—
all still fall short of **non-action**,
for how difficult it is!

The Sage does not act thus.
Though he acts, he never departs from **non-action**,
and his actions arise from **non-action**—
thus his benefit and nourishment extend to all ages,
yet he does not love the people.
He never intended to love the people,
yet his achievements overshadow the world,
as if they were not his own.
He never intended to govern the realm—
thus **non-action**,
using the world while having abundance.

When the **Heavenly Gate** opens and shuts,
can it be **feminine** [雌]?

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"The Classic says: Know the **masculine** [雄], hold to the **feminine** [雌], and become the **valley** [溪] of the world.
The Sage embodies the transformations of the **Dao**,
expanding and contracting, opening and closing without defying the seasons,
manifesting **softness** and **strength** as needed.
Yet he never leads and always follows,
never overcomes things and always yields to them—
thus the world delights in pushing him forward without tiring,
and he is truly **feminine**."*

The **Annotations** state:
*"The Classic says: Know the **masculine**, hold to the **feminine**, and become the **valley** of the world.
For the **masculine** conquers things with **strength**,
while the **feminine** abides in **softness**.
To know the **masculine** while holding to the **feminine**—
this is to not conquer with **strength** yet still abide in **softness**,
thus becoming the **valley** of the world.
For the **valley** is where water gathers after flowing downward.

The Sage responds to transformations,
moves with **Heaven’s** course,
thus embodying the **Dao’s** transformations.
Rolling and unrolling, opening and closing,
shifting with the times—
thus his rolling and unrolling, opening and closing,
never defies its season.
Knowing **softness**, knowing **strength**,
knowing subtlety, knowing clarity—
all are employed as needed.
Knowing to hold back while appearing first,
never leading yet always following;
knowing to guard **softness** while being strong,
never overcoming yet always yielding—
thus his goodness is never exhausted,
the world delights in pushing him forward without tiring,
and he is truly **feminine**."*

**Illuminated and all-pervading, can one truly be without knowing?**

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"With **cleverness** and **wisdom**, one guards with **stupidity**—
this carries the same meaning."*

The **Annotations** state:
*"True knowing is **non-knowing**,
and **non-knowing** is knowing—
thus one can be without knowing,
yet without **non-knowing**.
Gongzi said: With **cleverness** and **wisdom**, one guards with **stupidity**.
**Cleverness** is for plotting,
**wisdom** is for discernment,
**sageliness** means nothing is beyond reach,
**wisdom** means nothing is unknown—
thus **cleverness** and **wisdom** may be called **illuminated and all-pervading**.
Yet the **Perfect One** penetrates the boundless yet seems dim,
is vast yet seems obscured—
this is guarding with **stupidity**.
What else could it be but **non-knowing**?

In ancient times, **Zhi Yong** observed thieves,
**Wenzi** knew his death was unjust,
**Yanzi** appeared foolish,
and **Confucius** praised him—
thus, **illuminated and all-pervading** yet able to **non-knowing**,
he attained the **Dao** of **holding fullness**."

To **nourish and accumulate** [生之畜之],
to **nourish without possessing**,
to **act without relying**,
to **lengthen without controlling**—
this is called **Mysterious Virtue** [玄德].

**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:
*"The Sage preserves **spirit** and knows transformation,
uniting with the **Dao**—
thus he aligns with the **Divine Bright**,
nurtures all things without limit.
He **nourishes** to fulfill their nature,
**accumulates** to perfect their sustenance.
Without a heart of love and benefit,
thus he **nourishes without possessing**.
Without boastful conduct,
thus he **acts without relying**.
Without artificial craft,
thus he **lengthens without controlling**.
Such is his virtue—deep, distant, and contrary to things—
thus it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.
**Heaven’s** **Dao** ascends to the north,
then intertwines with things.
**Mysterious** is **Heaven’s** hue—
when the Sage embodies **Heaven’s** **Dao** as **virtue**,
nothing short of **Mysterious** suffices to name it."*

The **Annotations** state:
*"The Sage’s **spirit** is wondrous yet unfathomable,
only he preserves it, uniting with the **Divine**.
Transformation follows form and shifts—
only he knows it, uniting with **change**.
The Sage preserves **spirit** and knows transformation,
thus uniting with the **Dao**.

Only by uniting with the **Dao** does he align with **Heaven** and **Earth’s** virtue,
becoming the foundation for all things—
even **Heaven** and **Earth’s** **Divine Bright** suffice to match him,
and all things, though many, suffice to be nurtured by him,
with nothing beyond his capacity.
Thus his **nourishing** fulfills their nature—
this is the **Dao** of all things finding their proper place.
His **accumulating** perfects their sustenance—
this is the **Dao** of all things thriving when properly nourished.
Though he initiates movement,
yet all things self-generate and self-transform,
treating all things as **straw dogs**—
he never harbors a heart of love and benefit—
who could possess this?
Thus he **nourishes without possessing**.

Though he manifests in transformations,
yet the people daily improve without knowing him—
he never engages in boastful conduct—
who could rely on this?
Thus he **acts without relying**.

Though he appears in unification,
yet his governance is self-originating while great measures are not imposed—
he never employs artificial craft—
who could control this?
Thus he **lengthens without controlling**.

The **nourisher** often errs by possessing while able to **not possess**,
the **actor** often errs by relying on completion while able to **not rely**,
the **controller** often errs by carving and refining while able to **not control**—
yet his subtlety and obscurity are beyond measure,
transcending all things—
thus his virtue is profound, distant, and contrary to things.
No virtue is more subtle and profound—
thus it is called **Mysterious Virtue**.

The *Classic of Changes* says: **Heaven is Mysterious, Earth is Yellow.**
Thus **Mysterious** is **Heaven’s** hue.
Spring is the **Azure Heaven**—
**Mysterious** is the **Dao’s** return to winter,
the time of the **Northern Gate’s** distinction.
When the Sage embodies **Heaven’s** **Dao** as **virtue**,
refined and subtle—
**Heaven’s** **Dao** has already unfolded—
nothing short of **Mysterious** suffices to name it."*

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
when the hub is empty, the carriage’s use is complete.
Mold clay into a vessel—
when the vessel is empty, its use is complete.
Carve doors and windows for a dwelling—
when the dwelling is empty, its use is complete.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
The interplay of presence and absence is the ultimate principle—
utility emerges from their interplay.
Presence and absence differ in form:
presence as substance, absence as function—
the operation of yin and yang, the logic of all things.

The carriage’s use lies in motion,
the vessel’s in containment,
the dwelling’s in emptiness.
Mysterious utility arises from the utmost absence,
transformation is concealed in non-attachment—
like a balance without form,
manifesting through things yet unseen.
The Perfect Person’s mind ever resolves this truth.

Explanatory commentary:
Observing the ultimate principle,
one perceives presence yet it is not truly present,
absence yet it is not truly absent.
In the interplay of presence and absence,
all utility arises—
thus presence and absence align,
utility flows—
this is the ultimate principle.

Observing yin and yang, all things:
what is manifest and visible is called presence,
what is obscure and unfathomable is called absence.
Distinguishing presence and absence in their forms—
presence as substance, absence as function—
the operation of yin and yang, the logic of all things.

Thus thirty spokes converge at a hub,
clay is shaped into vessels,
doors and windows are carved for dwellings—
all are manifest in presence,
and utility lies therein.
Yet what enables the carriage to move,
the vessel to contain,
the dwelling to be empty?
Mysterious utility arises from the utmost absence,
yet no trace is seen;
transformation is concealed in non-attachment,
yet no boundary is glimpsed.
Like a balance without form,
manifesting through things yet unseen—
neither forcing nor resisting,
responding yet not hoarding—
neither presence nor absence,
yet adapting to things without harm.
The Perfect Person’s mind ever resolves this truth.

Thus presence is for utility,
absence is for function.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
Presence is solid, absence is void—
solidity possesses form, likeness, sound, color, and substance,
voidness enables motion, measure, response, and fulfillment without end.
Between Heaven and Earth,
the Dao manifests through vessels,
thus absence never abandons presence;
vessels embody the Dao’s mystery,
thus presence inevitably returns to absence.
Wood bends, water moistens,
fire radiates, metal hardens,
earth balances, and grains emerge—
this is presence, yet humanity relies on it for utility.
Heaven’s motion, Earth’s stability,
the seasons’ progression, all things flourishing—
who governs this?
This is absence.
Yet the world fails to perceive its operation,
so its utility is inexhaustible.

Presence and absence generate each other—
Laozi elucidates these three principles.
Explanatory commentary:
Presence entails obstruction, absence is not mere emptiness;
absence entails continuity, yet is not mere void.
Solidity possesses form, likeness, sound, color, and substance—
thus presence is for utility.
Voidness enables motion, measure, response, and fulfillment without end—
thus absence is for function.
The Dao descends into the dual realm:
above form, it does not depart from presence,
yet presence also reveals it—
thus the Dao manifests through vessels,
absence never abandons presence.
Below form, it does not extend beyond absence,
yet presence also conceals it—
thus vessels embody the Dao’s mystery,
presence inevitably returns to absence.

The Five Phases disperse:
water and fire for function,
metal and wood for vessels,
earth and grain for utility.
Wood bends, water moistens,
fire radiates, metal hardens,
earth balances, and grains emerge—
all within Heaven and Earth,
what does not depend on this?
Thus humanity relies on it for utility.

Descending into the realm,
Heaven moves, Earth rests,
the seasons progress, all things thrive—
as if governed by unseen mechanisms,
as if turning yet unable to halt—
who directs this?
It is all Heaven.
Thus the world fails to perceive its operation,
yet absence is true presence,
presence is genuine absence—
presence and absence generate each other,
like a cycle without end.
From the vastness of Heaven and Earth
to the minutiae of autumnal hairs—
nothing escapes this.

Through the carriage’s motion,
the vessel’s containment,
the dwelling’s capacity,
one understands all things under Heaven—
their motion, their containment, their capacity—
by analogy.
Laozi expounds these three principles,
thus one knows ten thousand things from a single example.

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
The eyes encompass two [yin lines],
their seeing is innate—
penetrating to clarity, wisdom arises,
sufficient to resolve all doubts.
The ears contain one [yang line],
their hearing is innate—
penetrating to acuity, strategy arises,
sufficient to communicate all intentions.
Those who perceive the Dao,
above form, gaze with spirit alone,
beyond sound, listen with qi alone—
what need for ears and eyes?
How could colors and sounds obstruct them?

Explanatory commentary:
Two broken lines yield a female,
yin within, yang without—
this is the symbol of the eyes,
thus the eyes encompass two.
Derived from the eight trigrams as fire,
fire’s light projects outward—
thus innate seeing is vision.
Penetrating vision becomes wisdom,
wisdom resolves all doubts—
what five colors could disrupt this clarity?

A whole line yields a male,
yin without, yang within—
this is the symbol of the ears,
thus the ears contain one.
Derived from the eight trigrams as water,
water’s clarity illuminates within—
thus innate hearing is perception.
Penetrating hearing becomes acuity,
acuity devises strategy,
sufficient to communicate all intentions—
what five tones could drown this clarity?

Those who perceive the Dao comprehend this,
and grasp the subtleties of seeing and hearing.
Above form, they gaze with spirit alone—
thus they see what is unseen.
They grasp the subtleties of hearing beyond sound,
beyond voice, they listen with qi alone—
thus they hear what is unsounded.
Seeing nothing unseen, hearing nothing unheard,
their vision and hearing transcend ears and eyes,
yet all they perceive is true—
what sounds or colors could ever obscure them?

Common folk cannot bear what they see,
nor comprehend what they hear.
They harmonize with the unsounded,
enslaved by ears and eyes to external burdens,
delight in brightness yet indulge in color—
who knows the Dao’s true hue?
They delight in acuity yet indulge in sound—
who knows the Dao’s great resonance?

When cleverness fades and wisdom dims,
the deaf are not truly without ears,
the blind are not truly without eyes—
what choice between them?
Yet people blind and deaf themselves—
could sounds and colors make them so?

The five flavors leave the mouth parched,
hunting and chasing drive the heart to madness.
*(Note: The Dao’s utterance is subtle, without taste.)*
The five flavors all share a common craving,
yet rich flavors are truly poisonous—
thus they leave the mouth parched.

Human life is brief, the body small,
yet the heart aligns with the transformations of the cosmos.
The sage’s heart moves and weaves the myriad realms,
stills and balances heaven and earth.

Common folk pursue hunting and chasing,
losing their true nature in the process,
unable to master themselves—
is this not the greatest sorrow?

*(Explanatory commentary:)*
People eat grains and livestock,
deer and elk eat grasses,
minnows and maggots eat snakes,
owls and crows feast on mice—
which knows the Dao’s true flavor?
The true flavor is the Dao’s utterance:
subtle, without taste.

All know the flavors they crave are shared,
yet they do not know the flavor of the Dao exists—
thus they take grains, livestock, and rice as sufficient.
Yet rich flavors are truly poisonous,
though they may nourish the body,
they lose the greater essence.
This is why the five flavors leave the mouth parched.

*(Note: Parched—meaning errant.)*
The mouth parched loses its true flavor.
Moreover, human life is brief and small—
what belongs to humanity is a body not exceeding a few feet,
yet vast is the heart that aligns with the cosmos,
companion to the transformations of nature.

The Sage exhausts the truth of the heart,
moves and weaves the myriad directions—
then flows unrestricted, without question.
In stillness, he weighs heaven and earth—
then illuminates boundlessly, without limit.
Now he governs the six *qi*’s distinctions,
to wander the boundless—
why then engage in hunting and trapping?

The ignorant do not know:
to conquer oneself is strength.
They labor only in chasing and pursuing,
sometimes stumbling in haste to agitate the heart,
yet cannot find themselves—
and thus lose their true heart.
Is this not called great sorrow?

Rare treasures obstruct one’s conduct.
**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Li* nourishes people, but *huò* transforms them—
thus, when *li* and *huò* interact, both are sustained.

The Sage does not prize rare treasures,
does not prize curiosities,
holds common goods in low regard—
wishing people to rest content in their allotted portion,
without coveting.

To prize rare treasures
leads to neglecting the essence of life and death,
yet gluttonously seeking wealth and rank—
what conduct can endure this?
Thus, rare treasures obstruct one’s path.

**Zhonghu’s praise of Tang** says:
*"Do not cultivate wealth and profit."*
**Confucius told Zigong:**
*"You, Shì, did not receive your mandate yet engage in commerce—"*
So great is the obstruction of wealth to conduct.

**Explanatory Notes** say:
The ancient kings encouraged migration,
harmonizing abundance and scarcity,
to enrich and circulate wealth,
so that *li* and *huò* interact and both are sustained.
Indeed, *li* nourishes people,
but when transformed, it becomes *huò*—
thus, when *li* and *huò* interact, both are sustained.

Rare treasures—
clothing that cannot be worn,
food that cannot be eaten—
if these are prized,
then one neglects the essence of life and death,
yet gluttonously seeks wealth and rank,
plundering and deceiving without restraint.
To make people rest in the essence of life and death,
only conduct can guard this—
how difficult!

Thus, the Sage does not prize curiosities,
holds common goods in low regard—
for no other reason
than to make people content in their portion,
without coveting.

Therefore, he discards gold on the rugged peaks,
casts pearls into the Five Lakes’ depths—
not prizing rare treasures,
so that nourishment for self and others is complete,
and none are obstructed in their path.

**Zhonghu’s praise of Tang** says:
*"Do not cultivate wealth and profit."*
—meaning that *li* should not govern the conduct of the noble.

**Confucius told Zigong:**
*"You, Shì, did not receive your mandate yet engage in commerce—"*
—to admonish that *li* is not the conduct of the gentleman.

**Zhuangzi** desired to shatter jade and destroy pearls,
valuing instead those who do not covet wealth—
for this reason.

Thus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
hence, he discards the latter to take the former.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The *guà* of *Kūn* is the belly—
thick and bearing, containing all.
The *guà* of *Lí* are the eyes—
outerly perceiving, brightly discerning.
Thick and bearing, it receives all without discrimination,
collecting and storing—
nothing is left out, nothing is rejected—
thus, it receives without limit.
Outerly perceiving, it cannot help but distinguish—
it sees a hundred paces away,
yet cannot see its own eyelashes—
thus, it has its limits.

The Sage effaces distinctions,
unifies good and evil,
taking the world as measure—
thus, he takes this containing belly,
without partiality or selection,
without taking or discarding,
not governing each matter or scrutinizing each thing.
Hence, he discards those outer-seeing eyes.

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"No thief is greater than virtue with a heart,
and a heart with eyes."*
Thus, the Sage rejects them.

**Explanatory Notes** say:
*Kūn* is thick and bearing, containing all things,
nurturing and transforming with radiance—
taken near to the body, it is the belly,
thick and bearing, containing all.
Outer *yáng*, inner *yīn*—
the two *yáng* make *Lí*, taken near to the body, are the eyes,
outerly perceiving, brightly discerning.

Thick and bearing, it never discriminates—
collecting and storing, nothing is left out, nothing is rejected—
thus, it receives without limit.
Outerly perceiving, it cannot help but distinguish—
it sees a hundred paces away,
yet cannot see its own eyelashes—
thus, it has its limits.

The Sage effaces distinctions,
unifies good and evil,
taking the world as measure—
thus, he takes this containing belly,
without partiality or selection,
without taking or discarding,
not governing each matter or scrutinizing each thing.
Hence, he discards those outer-seeing eyes.

**Zhuangzi** said:
*"No thief is greater than virtue with a heart,
and a heart with eyes."*
Indeed, *dé* opens heaven,
but *zéi* (harm) opens humanity—
a heart with eyes opens humanity and brings harm—
thus, the Sage does not make them eyes.

**Chapter Thirteen: On Honor and Humiliation**
Honor and humiliation are like a startling fright,
great calamities are like a threat to one’s life.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Honor is below, rank is above—
to dwell in honor and take it as pride is humiliation.
To dwell in rank and take it as a burden is no greater calamity.
Those who regard wealth as right cannot refuse office,
those who regard eminence as right cannot refuse fame.
Those who cling to power cannot entrust it to others—
to hold it makes one tremble,
to relinquish it brings sorrow.
This is why honor and humiliation are like a startling fright?

Pain and anguish, ease and contentment—
these gather in the body,
urgent dread and joyful delight—
these drown the heart.
This is why great calamities are like a threat to one’s life?

**Explanatory Notes** say:
Honor is what people prize—
the way of those below.
Rank is what people burden themselves with—
the way of those above.
To dwell in honor and take it as pride is to exhaust its fullness—
exhaust its fullness, and it becomes humiliation.
Or, to dwell in rank and take it as a burden is to be proud of one’s rank—
to be proud of one’s rank is no greater calamity.

Those who regard wealth as right cannot refuse office—
burdened by abundant gain.
Those who regard eminence as right cannot refuse fame—
burdened by high renown.
Those who cling to power cannot entrust it to others—
because power and authority are not uniquely theirs,
the proud then grow sorrowful.
Thus, these three:
to hold them brings trembling—
this is *"having gained it, fearing to lose it"*—
to relinquish them brings sorrow—
this is *"parting with it, finding no joy"*—
thus, honor and humiliation are like a startling fright?

What gathers in the body—
if not pain and anguish from the assault of *yīn* and *yáng*,
then ease and contentment.
What drowns the heart in human affairs—
if not urgent dread from proximity to *yīn*,
then joyful delight from leaning toward *yáng*.
The myriad breaths of one’s life rise and clash—
to dwell in rank and take it as a burden,
its calamities are no different.

「Why does this great *qi* weigh upon one like the body?
What is meant by *"honor and humiliation"*?
Honor is low—
*Huizong*’s annotation says: The dragon, as a creature,
shifts and transforms at will,
unrestrained, impossible to tame.
If it can be covered by the ancient [ritual],
then its spirit is set on domestication—
this is the path of humiliation.

The ancients who excelled in *shi*’s way:
The rank of three *jīng* flags was insufficient to shake their resolve,
the wealth of ten thousand *chóng* measures could not shift their steadfastness.
To dwell in favor yet ponder peril,
to hold fortune yet act as though empty—
then what humiliation could there be?

To covet rank and crave wealth,
to know advancement yet not retreat,
to grasp gain yet not foresee loss—
then one is already debased.
Thus, to receive favor from others
is the way of the lowly.

The *Shūyì* elaborates:
The heavens’ matchless transformations are like the dragon—
united, it forms a body;
scattered, it becomes a pattern.
This is shifting and transforming at will,
unrestrained, impossible to tame.

Unable to see yet unable to contain [its nature],
it has not yet escaped the ancient [ritual]’s cover—
if one strives to domesticate it for harness and riding,
then regret is inevitable.
This is why—
if it can be covered by the ancient [ritual],
then its spirit is set on domestication—
this is the path of humiliation.

The reason honor becomes humiliation
is thus.

Therefore, the ancients who excelled in *shi*’s way:
The rank of three *jīng* flags was insufficient to shake their resolve,
for they knew that what lies within me
is nobler than the rank of three *jīng* flags.
The wealth of ten thousand *chóng* measures could not shift their steadfastness,
for they knew that what lies within me
is richer than ten thousand *chóng* measures.

To master the art of retaining favor,
one dwells in favor yet ponders peril;
to grasp the way of preserving fortune,
one holds fortune yet acts as though empty—
thus, they can endure wealth and rank without losing themselves,
and their blessings and fortunes endure long and steady.
What humiliation could there be?

If one covets rank yet falsifies oneself to gain nobility,
or craves wealth yet indulges in corruption to gain riches,
knowing advancement yet not retreat,
obscuring the logic of growth and decline,
grasping gain yet not foreseeing loss,
ignoring the cycles of fullness and emptiness—
then the nobility of *Zhao Meng*
is but a step toward debasement.

Thus, to receive favor from others
is the way of the lowly.

To gain it is like a startling fright,
to lose it is like a startling fright—
this is *"honor and humiliation are like a startling fright"*.

*Huizong*’s annotation says:
The cap and robes upon one’s person
are not the Dao/Way of life and death.
External things arrive like transient guests—
if they come, they cannot be refused;
thus, the sage does not take delight in gaining them.
If they depart, they cannot be detained—
thus, the sage does not sorrow over losing them.
Yet now, if they depart, one finds no joy,
and if received, one takes pleasure—
so gain and loss burden the heart,
how could one not be startled?

*Liu Xià Huì* served as a magistrate,
thrice dismissed yet refusing to leave,
*Zhèng Kǎo Fù* received three commands,
yet fled along the walls—
how different from this!

The *Shūyì* elaborates:
True nobility lies within oneself—
enough to rival the titles of a kingdom.
Yet the cap and robes upon one’s person
are not the Dao/Way of life and death.
External things cannot be clung to,
and seeking them brings no benefit to what is already gained—
for they arrive like transient guests.
Only time is without end,
so their coming cannot be refused,
and their gain—
what does it add to me?
Thus, the sage does not take delight in gaining them.

Only division is without permanence,
so their departure cannot be detained—
and their loss—
what harm does it bring to me?
Thus, the sage does not sorrow over losing them.
The deluded do not understand the extremes of destitution and abundance,
like the sequence of winter and summer—
if they depart, one finds no joy,
or one may fall into poverty and lowliness.
If received, one takes pleasure,
or one may be bent by wealth and rank.
Gain and loss wage war within the chest,
even the spirit platform is obstructed—
how few escape being startled!

*Liu Xià Huì* served as a magistrate,
thrice dismissed yet refusing to leave,
*Zhèng Kǎo Fù* received three commands,
yet fled along the walls—
could it be that gain and loss burdened their hearts?
What is meant by *"the greatest calamity of nobility is like the body"*?

*Huizong*’s annotation says:
To grasp advantage and power,
to monopolize rewards and punishments,
to wield blessings and threats—
the world fears them like gods and reveres them like emperors.
This is nobility indeed.

Yet the sage does not let nobility weigh upon them,
so they can long endure nobility without exhaustion.
Like a person whose limbs and body fall into ruin,
whose ears and eyes lose their acuity,
who abandons form yet is not bound by it,
who discards wisdom yet does not cling to it—
to merge with the Great Unity,
then there is none who does not find themselves at ease.
The world’s people exchange their nature for things,
so they are burdened by things yet cannot forget their power.
They let form weigh upon the heart,
so they lose the heart yet cannot forget form—
their calamity is great.

The *Shūyì* elaborates:
To dwell in nobility as one’s own,
one cannot escape exhaustion—
only if one does not claim nobility as one’s own
can one truly guard it.
Like a person’s body:
to think it is mine brings constant hindrance;
to know the body is not truly mine,
then one can preserve it.

Now, if one grasps the weight of advantage and power,
holds the authority of rewards and punishments,
and monopolizes the tools of blessings and threats—
the world fears them like gods and reveres them like emperors,
their nobility is unmatched.
Yet only the sage, wielding the void to govern the full,
does not dwell in nobility as their own—
so though they are noble, they suffer no exhaustion.

Like a person’s body:
to contain the hundred bones yet let limbs falter,
to embody ears and eyes yet let wisdom dim,
to abandon form yet not be constrained by it,
to discard wisdom yet not cling to it—
then one attains Great Permeation,
constructing the formless,
and there is none who does not find themselves at ease.
Who could take the body as exhaustion?

The vulgar and shallow cannot exhaust their nature while fixating on power,
so they are burdened by things, exchanging their nature for them;
they cannot exhaust their heart while clinging to form,
so they are weighed down by form, losing their heart.
To exchange one’s nature for things,
to let form weigh upon the heart—
their calamity is great.

The reason I have great calamity
is that I have a body.
When I have no body,
what calamity could I have?

*Huizong*’s annotation says:
Human birth—
the hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera are complete and stored within.
Who could I truly call my own?
To recognize and claim them all
is but delusion.
Those who embody the Dao understand this,
so Confucius said:
*"Morning hearing of the Dao,
evening death would be acceptable."*
Mencius said:
*"Life and death are not two separate things."*
Yan Ziyuan said:
*"Yan [Child] sat and forgot himself."*」

The greatness of life and death is vast indeed,
yet it does not alter one’s self—
how much more so the gains and losses, calamities and blessings, that lie between them?

This has no other cause
than knowing that within one’s form and body dwell the true *Dao/Way* and sovereign.
Thus, the *Zhi Ren* of antiquity
did not let profit weigh upon their form,
nor did their form weigh upon their heart.
They saw all things as inseparable from themselves,
yet could not choose among them—
then their body was not truly theirs.

Above, they played with the *造物者* [Creator],
below, they befriended the external, endless life and death.
Who could truly weary them?
Favored by the world, yet they took it as dishonor;
held in esteem by all, yet they saw it as no burden—
for they knew the external things could not be relied upon,
and this was the natural order.

If one can truly possess without possessing,
then though favored, they would not be shamed,
though esteemed, they would not be weary.
Yi Yin did not dwell on favor and success,
while Yao did not take his position as pleasure—
this is nearly it.

*Huizong*’s annotation says:
The world is a great vessel,
but only the *Dao/Way* can move it;
the world is a divine vessel,
but only the *Dao/Way* can guard it.
The sage embodies the *Dao/Way*,
so when they govern the world, the world finds joy in their benevolence without tiring.
The lesser ones know that to value their body is not to demean themselves in serving things,
as though they could entrust it—
to love their body is not to harm themselves in being constrained by things,
as though they could rely upon it.

Thus it is said:
The true *Dao/Way* is used to govern oneself,
its remnants to govern the state,
and its dregs to govern the world.
The vulgar *junzi* of the world
endanger their body and abandon their life to serve things—
is this not tragic?

The *Shu Yi* says:
Within the six directions and beyond,
there is no end or limit—
the world is a great vessel.
There must be what transcends the vessel
before it can be moved—
what transcends the vessel is the *Dao/Way*.
Established in the unfathomable,
acting without fixed methods—
the world is a divine vessel.
There must be what aligns with the divine
before it can be guarded—
what aligns with the divine is the *Dao/Way*.
The sage embodies this within themselves,
so they govern the world without corrupting their nature,
bear the world’s burdens without altering their *virtue/power*,
and from west to east, from south to north,
none do not submit—
the world finds joy in their benevolence without tiring.

The lesser ones understand that things are not truly things,
yet they do not know how to govern the world.
They know that one limb is heavier than one kingdom,
two arms are heavier than the world,
and the body is heavier than two arms—
to value their body is not to harm themselves,
to love their body is not to demean themselves—
as though they could entrust and rely upon it.

Is it not that they mutilate life and harm their nature,
sacrificing their body—
restlessly enslaved by things,
wearily burdened by things,
not knowing the way to preserve themselves?

This is exactly what Zhuangzi meant by:
The true *Dao/Way* is used to govern oneself,
its remnants to govern the state,
and its dregs to govern the world.

The vulgar *junzi* of the world do not know that the body is the master of life,
so they kill their body to achieve fame,
use many means to destroy their life,
chase after things without returning—
endangering their body and abandoning their life to follow things,
like using the *Su Hou’s pearl* to shoot a thousand *ren*-high sparrow,
losing far more than they gain—
is this not tragic?

**Chapter 14: The Vision That Does Not See Forms**
The vision that does not see forms is called *yi* [level/plain].

*Huizong*’s annotation says:
The eyes are the master of vision,
vision is used to distinguish things—
*yi* is level and without distinction,
not within the reach of vision,
so it is called *yi*.

The *Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is unseen,
yet *qi* is already there.

The *Shu Yi* says:
Heaven gives birth to wood in threes,
which in humans becomes the liver—
the liver opens to the eyes,
so in the five *zang* organs, it governs vision.
Thus the eyes are the master of vision.

The *ming liang* [clear vision] is *li* [separation] in two,
symbolized in the eyes,
and the eyes, regarding colors,
unite only after seeing—
thus vision is used to distinguish things.

Yet when vision can see,
it has not yet separated from colors—
whether high or low,
it can be distinguished.
The wondrous *Dao/Way* is not a color—
green and empty, void and empty,
not the slightest trace or sign—
vision is insufficient to see it.
Its level and boundless nature—
who could distinguish high from low?

The *Liezi* states: *The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is unseen, yet *qi* is already there.

In the beginning of *hunlun* [chaotic unity], *qi* has not yet manifested, its level and boundless nature is known, hence it is called *yi* [evenness].

When hearing does not hear, it is called *xi* [subtle/rare].

The *Huizong* [Emperor Huizong] annotated: The ears govern hearing, and hearing is used to discern things. *Xi* [subtle/rare] implies a faintness with gaps, beyond what hearing can perceive—hence it is called *xi*.

*The great sound, rare and faint, is already there.*

The *Shu Yi* [loose exposition] says:
Heaven one gives birth to water,
in the *zang* [viscera] it becomes the kidneys—
the kidneys open to the ears,
so in the five *zang* organs, it governs hearing,
and thus the ears are the master of hearing.

Water reaching its extreme becomes *kan* [the abyss],
symbolized in the ears,
and the ears, regarding sounds,
distinguish them only after perception—
thus hearing is used to discern things.

Yet when hearing can perceive,
it has not yet separated from sounds—
whether clear or murky,
none can distinguish them.

The wondrous *Dao/Way* has no sound—
still and vast, *leao* [silent and empty],
never the slightest echo or resonance,
hearing is insufficient to perceive it.

The wind ceases, the rustling subsides,
faint and with gaps—
the *jing* [classic] says: *The great sound, rare and faint, is already there.*

It moves without direction,
dwells in the *yaoming* [profoundly obscure],
its faintness is known—
hence it is called *xi*.

When it cannot be grasped, it is called *wei* [minute].

The *Huizong* annotated: *Minute, how minute!*—
reaching the point of formlessness,
who could grasp it?

*The great form is formless, is already there.*

The *Shu Yi* says:
When *qi* transforms, only then does form arise,
and when form arises, it can be perceived.

The essence of the *Dao/Way* is profoundly obscure—
before anything began,
following it, yet unable to grasp it—
this is called *minute, how minute!*
reaching the point of formlessness.

When form exists, it can be grasped,
but the *Dao/Way*’s formlessness—
who could grasp it?

The *jing* [classic] says: *The great form is formless*—
then what form is greater than the *Dao/Way*?

It is only because it is formless,
that its greatness knows no bounds.

These three cannot be defined with precision—
hence they merge into one.

The *Huizong* annotated:
*The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is undifferentiated—
who could distinguish high from low?

*The great sound, rare and faint*—
who could discern clear from murky?

*The great form is formless*—
who could define vast from minute?

The eyes have no use for their brightness,
the ears no application for their sharpness,
the body no exertion for its strength—
here lies the *Dao/Way*'s complete essence.

It cannot be exhausted by inquiry,
nor attained by exploration.

When *qi*, form, and substance are present yet undivided,
thus they merge into one.

Yet once they have become one,
how could it not be called *formless*?

The *Cushui* [commentary] says:
*The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is yet unjudged—
the *Liezi*’s "color-color" never reveals this.
"Color-color" is without color,
how could it distinguish high from low?

*The great sound is faint*—
the *Liezi*’s "sound-sound" never emits this.
"Sound-sound" is without sound,
how could it discern clear from murky?

*The great form is formless*—
the *Liezi*’s "shape-shape" never displays this.
"Shape-shape" is without form,
how could it define vast from minute?

Even if *Lizhu* [legendary seer] were to polish his eyes at noon and gaze,
he would still not perceive its form—
thus the eyes have no use for their brightness.

Even if *Shigang* [master of hearing] were to bow his head all night and strain his ears,
he would still not hear its sound—
thus the ears have no application for their sharpness.

Even if the wisest and most voracious scholars were to search endlessly,
they would never attain it—
thus the body has no exertion for its strength.

From its unseen aspect, it is called *formless*;
from its unheard aspect, it is called *faint*;
from its untouchable aspect, it is called *minute*.

These three share the same essence though different names,
pointing to one reality—
here lies the *Dao/Way*'s complete essence.

It cannot be exhausted by inquiry,
nor attained by exploration—
this is the *Liezi*’s "indistinct and chaotic."

Called "indistinct and chaotic,"
it is because *qi*, form, and substance are present yet undivided,
and they have not yet separated.

Once they have become one,
how could it not be called *formless*?

Its uppermost aspect is not *illuminated*,
its lowermost aspect is not *obscured*.

The *Huizong* annotated:
That which is beyond form—
the inscrutable interplay of *yin* and *yang*,
dark yet not easily lost—
this is called *ultimate mystery*, hence not *illuminated*.
"Illuminated" means "bright," and not *illuminated* means profound and difficult to know.

That which is beneath form—
one *yin*, one *yang*,
distinct yet numbered—
this is called *ultimate Dao/Way*, hence not *obscured*.
"Obscured" means "dark," and not *obscured* means clear and discernible.

The *Yijing* [Classic of Changes] says:
*The mysterious and the bright*—
this depends on the person.

The *Cushui* [commentary] says:
That which is beyond form is called *Dao/Way*,
and the mysterious is indeed its marvel.
Thus the mysterious is inherently beyond form.

*Yin* knows the mysterious exists within *yin*,
yet does not know it also exists within *yang*;
*Yang* knows the mysterious exists within *yang*,
yet does not know it also exists within *yin*.
Hence the mysterious is inscrutable in *yin* and *yang*.

Swift yet not hasty, moving yet not arriving,
lost yet truly present—
this is called the uppermost not *illuminated*.

That which is beneath form is called *instrumentality*,
yet the *Dao/Way* truly resides within it—
thus the *Dao/Way* is also beneath form.

It does not lean toward *yang* alone,
nor is it born solely from *yang*;
it does not cling to *yin* alone,
nor is it formed solely from *yin*.
Hence the *Dao/Way* is one *yin* and one *yang*.

It can be confined, it can be dispersed,
in the void yet manifest—
this is called the lowermost not *obscured*.

For "illuminated" and "illuminated" are as the same,
"illuminated" meaning "bright"—
not *illuminated* means profound and difficult to know.

For "obscured" and "obscured" are as the same,
"obscured" meaning "dark"—
not *obscured* means clear and discernible.

Yet if not the person,
the *Dao/Way* does not act in vain—
thus it is said: *The mysterious and the bright*—
this depends on the person.

Boundless yet nameless,
it returns to *non-existence*.

The *Huizong* annotated:
The *Dao/Way*'s essence—
like the regular succession of day and night,
yet its profound and bright nature is unfathomable.
Could it be captured in appearance, sound, or color?
Hence it returns to *non-existence*.

The *Cushui* [commentary] says:
The *Dao/Way*’s *thread*—
like the measure of things,
ensuring nothing strays from its straightness.
"Boundless" means it does not exceed the limits of regulation and scrutiny.

The *Dao/Way*'s *pattern* is orderly yet not disordered,
like the regular succession of day and night—
one dark, one bright, never failing.
Hence it is called "boundless."

Yet profound and marvelously obscure,
it has no name, no nameable origin,
and its profound and bright nature is unfathomable—
thus it cannot be named.

If so, then it returns to its root,
leaving not even a trace,
not only *non-existence* at the beginning,
but also *non-existence* beyond the beginning of *non-existence*—
how could it be captured in appearance, sound, or color?
This is called returning to *non-existence*.

This is called *the state of the stateless*,
the *form of the formless*—
this is called *dimly discernible*.

The *Huizong* annotated:
*The state of the stateless*,
the *form of the formless*—
dimly discernible, yet within it is substance;
obscure, yet within it are forms.

Like the *Great Void* [Tai Xu] containing all forms,
yet not revealing their outlines.

Like one *nature* [xing], one *spiritual intelligence* [lingzhi],
self-sufficient yet unfathomable in its workings.

Called "having yet not having,"
called "not having yet having"—
like the sun and moon, though distant,
when seeking water in their reflection or fire in their rays,
the water and fire arrive without delay.

Where do the water and fire truly reside?
*The state of the stateless*,
the *form of the formless*—
this is the same.

The *Cushui* [commentary] says:
There is a state, hence it can be seen,
yet the *Dao/Way* is unseen—
also not separate from seeing—
thus it is the *state of the stateless*.

There is a form, hence it can be represented,
yet the *Dao/Way* is formless—
also not separate from form—
thus it is the *form of the formless*.

*The state of the stateless*,
the *form of the formless*—
it suggests "having yet not having,"
dimly discernible yet containing substance,
it suggests "not having yet not having,"
obscure yet containing forms—
like the *Great Void* [Tai Xu],
one void giving rise to all things,
yet never confined,
containing all forms without revealing their outlines.

Like one *nature* [xing] without *nature*,
responding to all things without end,
deep yet unfathomable,
spiritual intelligence self-sufficient,
yet its marvelous workings are unfathomable.

It is having yet not having,
having in reality yet not having;
it is not having yet having,
not having in reality yet having.

As when the sun and moon are distant from people,
yet seeking water in the moon’s reflection
or fire in the sun’s rays with a *square mirror* [fangzhu] or *sunburner* [yangsui],
the water and fire arrive in no time.

「Water and fire, as things,
cannot be confined by the limits of having or not having.
Without form yet possessing form,
without substance yet containing essence—
this too is the case,
hence it is called *dimly discernible* [huánghū].

Approach it and you do not see its beginning,
follow it and you do not see its end.
Emperor *Huizong*’s annotation states:
*"Its beginning lacks a head,
its conclusion lacks a tail;
thus, when one approaches or follows it,
there is something one cannot fully perceive."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* says:
*"The complete body of the Dao
is a harmonious unity, whole and perfect.
When it precedes all things,
who can trace its origin?
When it suddenly appears,
who can grasp its conclusion?
This is what Zhuangzi meant by
its beginning lacking a head,
its conclusion lacking a tail.
Approach or follow it—
how could one ever truly see it?"*

To uphold the Dao of antiquity
and govern the present’s existence—
one who knows the ancient origins
is called *Dao’s fundamental principle* [dàojì].

Emperor *Huizong*’s annotation states:
*"One yin and one yang—this is the Dao."*

Those who follow Heaven’s Dao without Earth’s
may be blinded by its dynamism,
leaning upon its overwhelming yang—
those who follow Earth’s Dao without Heaven’s
may be drowned in its stillness,
halting at withered decay.

The *Moists*, who embrace universal love,
prioritize others while abandoning *rightness* [yì],
reaching a point where they see no extremes.
The *Yangists*, who uphold self-interest,
abandon *benevolence* [rén],
swinging wildly without law, without balance, without deviation—
they are confined by one-sidedness.
Is this the Dao of antiquity?

The Dao of antiquity
cannot be exhaustively defined yet is not nonexistent—
it is *dimly discernible* yet not *non-existent*.
Nothing exists outside its embrace,
thus it is called *dimly discernible* yet not *non-existent*.

To wield it for practical effect,
to examine it for validation—
to respond to all transformations,
to meet all that comes—
its adaptability is sufficient to exhaust all benefits,
its vitality is sufficient to exhaust all spiritual potency,
and in governing the world,
there is nothing it cannot address.
This is the Dao’s enduring constancy,
unchanging from ancient times—
the Dao that has always existed since before Heaven and Earth.

It is the *pivotal axis* [gāngzǎi] that governs all.
All who are bound by things,
without transcending this truth,
cannot stand firm.
The Dao’s enduring constancy knows no change.

Only those who can probe
the origins of all things
and know their beginnings
hold within themselves
the * Dao’s fundamental principles* [lúnjīng].
Thus it is said:
*"This is called Dao’s fundamental principle."* [dàojì]

The *Explanatory Commentary* on the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes:

*"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang,
yet though the Dao is not yin and yang,
it never departs from them.
Those who are ignorant of the Dao
split it into yin and yang alone—
some delight in life and burden the form,
thus blinded by the Dao’s dynamism,
leaning upon its overwhelming yang;
others pursue emptiness and forget the body,
thus drowned in the Dao’s stillness,
halting at withered decay.

The *Moists*, who embrace universal love,
prioritize others while abandoning *rightness* [yì],
reaching a point where they see no extremes—
this is their deviation.

The *Yangists*, who uphold self-interest,
abandon *benevolence* [rén],
swinging wildly without law, without balance, without deviation—
they are confined by one-sidedness.
Is this the Dao of antiquity?

The Dao of antiquity
has neither what is discarded nor what is retained—
it cannot be exhaustively defined yet is not nonexistent,
and nothing exists outside its embrace.
Thus it is called *dimly discernible* yet not *non-existent*.

To wield it for practical effect,
to examine it for validation—
to respond to all transformations,
to meet all that comes—
its adaptability is sufficient to exhaust all benefits,
its vitality is sufficient to exhaust all spiritual potency,
and in governing the world,
there is nothing it cannot address.
This is the Dao of antiquity.

This Dao,
long before the Upper Antiquity,
was not yet old—
before Heaven and Earth existed,
it had always been preserved.
It is the *pivotal axis* [gāngzǎi] that governs all.
All who are bound by things,
without transcending this truth,
cannot stand firm.
The Dao’s enduring constancy knows no change.

Only those who can probe
the origins of all things
and know their beginnings
hold within themselves
the * Dao’s fundamental principles* [lúnjīng].
Thus it is said:
*"This is called Dao’s fundamental principle."* [dàojì]

Chapter Fifteen: The Mastery of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [Shànwéi Shì Zhāng] of Antiquity

The ancient masters of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] were subtle, wondrous, and profound—so deep as to be unrecognizable.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] differed from that of today, and the masters who excelled in it differed from those who did not.
Thus, subtlety [wēi] aligns with the Dao, wondrousness [miào] harmonizes with the *Divine* [shén], profundity [yuān] matches the heavens, and penetration [tōng] reveals the *Sage’s* [shèng] essence. Yet, their depths are so concealed that they cannot be measured.

The *Book of Documents* [Shū] says: *"The Dao’s heart is but subtle."* [dàoxīn wéi wēi]
Thus, subtlety [wēi] is the Dao itself.
The *Book of Changes* [Yì] says: *"The Divine, indeed, is wondrous in all things and is named thus."* [shén yě zhě miào wànwù ér wéi yán]
Thus, wondrousness [miào] is the Divine.
The *Book of Changes* says: *"The heavens are profound, and the earth is vast."* [tiān xuán ér dì huáng]
Thus, profundity [yuān] is the color of the heavens.
The *Commentary* [Zhuàn] says: *"There is no obstruction in all things—this is called the Sage."* [shì wú bù tōng zhī wéi shèng]
Thus, penetration [tōng] is the Sage’s work.
The depths of water can be measured, and the depths of pits can be explored.
Yet the ancient masters of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì], their names and deeds unseen, awaken responses from the heels—so profound that they cannot be measured or explored.
Lü Yu was in Zhengpu for forty years, yet no one recognized him.
Laozi spoke to Confucius: *"A fine merchant hides his wares as if they were none; a Sage of virtue, though full of power, appears as if foolish."*
Is this what he meant?

The *Explanatory Commentary* [Shūyì] states: There was the Upper Antiquity, and the Middle Antiquity; the ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] refers to the Upper Antiquity.
There were the Upper Masters [shàngshì] and the Lower Masters [xiàshì]; the masters who excelled in the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] were of the Upper Master class.
Thus, the ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] differed from that of today, and the masters who excelled in it differed from those who did not.
The masters who excelled in the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] possessed talents reaching the heavens, their aspirations aligned with the Dao and the Divine, their wisdom matched the heavens, and their penetration the Sage’s.
So profound as to be unmeasurable, they were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—deep beyond recognition.
For they were unseen in form, the Dao had no shape, and could not be perceived by the eyes—only known subtly, hence their unity with the Dao.
This is what the *Book of Documents* [Shū] meant by *"The Dao’s heart is but subtle."* [dàoxīn wéi wēi]
The Divine’s wondrousness is without desire—only those who enter wondrousness can know it, for it cannot be sought with fixed expectations.
This is what the *Book of Changes* [Yì] meant by *"The Divine is wondrous in all things."* [shén miào wànwù]
Profoundity [yuān] as the heavens’ hue bears both *qi* [chì] and *essence* [yáng], for it can embrace both yin and yang.
Thus, the heavens’ color is in this, as the *Book of Changes* [Yì] says: *"The heavens are profound, and the earth is vast."* [tiān xuán ér dì huáng]
If one can be profound and vast, then one aligns with the heavens.
Penetration [tōng] means unrestricted passage—nothing can obstruct it.
Thus, the Sage’s work is in this, as the *Commentary* [Zhuàn] says: *"There is no obstruction in all things—this is called the Sage."* [shì wú bù tōng zhī wéi shèng]
If one aligns with the *Great Penetration* [Dàtōng], then one enters the Sage’s domain.
The ancient masters of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì], subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—so deep as to be unrecognizable—are like the heavens and earth.
As the following passage states, they are but named in approximation.
*"Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,
hesitant as if fearing four neighbors."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"Cautious"* [yù] means to plan rest before action.
*"Hesitant"* [yóu] means to consider doubt after completion.
The ancient ones who embodied the Dao took inner cultivation as their duty, not outer penetration as their delight.
They lived in constant fear and reflection, acting only when compelled—like crossing a river in winter, guarding without loss.
As if fearing four neighbors, this is what the *Book of Changes* [Yì] means by *"With this, one purifies and restrains."* [yǐ cǐ zhī jièjiè]

The *Explanatory Commentary* [Shūyì] states:
To plan before an event is called *cautious* [yù], hence *cautious* means to plan rest before action.
To plan after an event is called *hesitant* [yóu], hence *hesitant* means to consider doubt after completion.
The ancient ones who embodied the Dao took inner cultivation as their duty, not outer penetration as their ultimate goal.
They found forgetfulness of things as good, not delight in mastering things.
In constant fear and reflection, they dared not indulge—
before an event’s arrival, they responded only when moved, acted only when pressed, rising only when compelled.
Thus, they planned before events, like crossing a river in winter.

For matters already accomplished, one stands in solemn warning—
vision becomes still, action becomes slow,
planning comes after the deed,
as though fearing one’s neighbors.

For the river is where danger lies,
and crossing in winter is what people dread—
if one crosses in winter, how could it be otherwise?
Neighbors are those who stand close and care for one another,
ensuring mutual protection—
if one fears one’s neighbors, how could one lose oneself?

Yet then, is there anything that can be easily attained?
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"When the gentleman is about to act or move,
he must first purify and refine his virtue/power to manifest its clarity."*

This is what it means.

**Solemn as in reverence,**
Huizong’s annotation:
*The Analects* says: *"Gazing upon him, he appears solemn."*
*The Records* says: *"Solemn, as though in thought."*
Zhuangzi says: *"Things have no inherent Dao—
rectify one’s bearing to awaken them,
so that people’s intentions dissolve."*

The fully virtuous/powerful one—
from afar, he inspires awe;
up close, he does not weary.
Thus his demeanor is upright yet unassuming.

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
When entering and distinguishing among things,
one risks entanglement in limbs and bones,
and the body becomes something to be trodden upon.
When exiting and interacting with things,
one manifests in movement and stillness,
and one’s bearing and posture become observable.
**Solemn as in reverence**—
this is the moment of exiting to interact with things,
when bearing and posture are fit to be observed.
*The Analects’* *"Gazing upon him, he appears solemn,"*
and *The Records’* *"Solemn, as though in thought"*
both convey this meaning.

Zhuangzi says: *"Things have no inherent Dao—
rectify one’s bearing to awaken them,
so that people’s intentions dissolve."*
Indeed, the fully virtuous/powerful one’s appearance is utterly simple and empty,
standing beside others and transforming them—
what more, when seen in gestures and expressions?
Adjusting his garments and dignifying his gaze,
from afar, he inspires awe—
for others, this means no ill intent;
up close, he does not weary—
for himself, this means no exhaustion.
Thus his power to transform others is effortless.
The ancient *True Persons* were upright yet unassuming—
how could they ever slouch and fawn to invite humiliation?

**Dissolving like ice about to thaw,**
Huizong’s annotation:
*"Water congeals to form ice, ice melts back to water—
in essence, they are one."*

Those ensnared by one-sidedness
are like water congealing;
those attuned to the Great Unity
are like ice thawing.
The *Book of Changes* says:
*"Dissolving—separation."*
To abandon things and people without attachment—
this is what it means to dissolve.

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
Water, though clear, freezes into unclean ice;
the spirit, though luminous, solidifies into an opaque form.
Yin congeals to form ice—
just as the spirit manifests as form.
Yang melts to become water—
just as form returns to the spirit.
Water and ice are one in essence.

Those ensnared by one-sidedness
know only to guard the form and not to exhaust the spirit,
thus like water congealing—
born from water yet obstructing its flow.
Those attuned to the Great Unity
know to forget the form and merge with the spirit,
thus like ice thawing—
spreading freely without hindrance.

The *Book of Changes* pairs wind over water as *"Dissolving"* in *Hexagram Variations*,
yet in *Appended Commentary* it says *"Dissolving—separation."*
Thus *"Dissolving"* in meaning
refers to abandoning things and people without attachment.
Only by abandoning things and people
does one dissolve like ice thawing—
who then would have attachments?
Compared to the frozen, rigid ice,
the difference is vast.

*The Great Origin* says: *"Without attachments—this is the Sage."*
**Dissolving like ice about to thaw**—
is this not the way to enter Sagehood?

**Thick as in sincerity, like uncarved wood,**
Huizong’s annotation:
*"Thick" is the utmost of depth.
Nature is originally profound,
like wood before it is shaped into vessels.*

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
The *Book of Changes* speaks of *"thick virtue"*—
virtue as the utmost depth;
*The Records* speaks of *"thick teaching"*—
teaching as the utmost depth.
Thus *"thick"* is the utmost of depth.

Only when people’s lives are profound
does their nature remain profound.
Yet when they shift with circumstances,
the profound becomes shallow.
Only the virtuous scholar
restores the original nature,
does not shift with things,
and thus is like uncarved wood—
uncarved yet encircled with visible grain,
not yet shaped into a vessel,
its depth truly profound.
Compared to hewing it with an axe,
splitting its wholeness,
carving it into sacrificial vessels,
and painting it with green and yellow—
the difference is vast.

**Vast as in emptiness, like a valley,**
Huizong’s annotation:
*"Vast" is the extreme of breadth.
The heart originally has no bounds,
like a valley’s emptiness—
receiving and responding without limit.*

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*The Odes* speaks of *"vast wilderness"*—
referring to land’s utmost breadth;
*The Commentary* speaks of *"vast days"*—
referring to time’s utmost breadth.
Thus *"vast"* is the extreme of breadth.

When the inch of the heart aligns with the boundless void,
the heart originally has no limits.
Without boundaries yet not confined,
its chamber remains ever empty.
Only the virtuous scholar,
at the peak of emptiness,
exhausts the truth of the heart,
like a valley’s ability to receive—
receiving without accumulation,
like a valley’s ability to respond—
responding without attachment.
Its breadth is truly profound.
Compared to the six orifices clashing,
narrowing one’s dwelling,
and obstructing the Dao with solidity—
the difference is vast.

**Undifferentiated as in turbidity.**
Huizong’s annotation:
*"Not carved nor polished to achieve harmony,
not exaggerated to stand out—
undifferentiated, yet complete, like turbidity."*

This differs from those who refine themselves to reveal impurity.

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
The Perfect One’s way in the world
is to blend light with dust,
to rectify angles and round them,
to be greatly modest without resentment,
to act without rigid rules—
never carving nor polishing to achieve harmony.
Not seeking distinction,
they follow the common—
never exaggerating to stand out.
Moving with danger yet yielding,
adapting to things with flexibility,
not erecting rigid corners,
undifferentiated, yet complete.

While others are bright and clear,
I alone appear muddled—
seeming turbid yet not turbid.
This differs from those who refine themselves to reveal impurity.

Who could make turbidity still to let clarity arise gradually?
Who could make stillness move to let life unfold slowly?

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
The Daoist adept moves yet remains still,
ranging freely yet returning to their roots,
established yet able to respond,
boundless yet fulfilling all demands.
Thus, when stillness lets clarity arise gradually, nothing can muddy them;
when movement lets life unfold slowly, nothing can unsettle them.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Come slowly, slowly."*
Slowly means to proceed with ease and self-adjustment.

The Perfect One’s use of mind
is not to prize stillness as an end in itself,
nor to labor over life’s emergence as a feat.
Following its natural course,
they entrust it to unfold naturally,
without haste or coercion—
thus clarity arises gradually.
When stillness lets clarity arise gradually,
ten thousand things cannot perturb their mind—
who could muddy them?
When movement lets life unfold slowly,
ten thousand things cannot ensnare their thoughts—
who could unsettle them?

If stillness implies cessation,
being bound by things, then it is cessation—
how could one respond to things without harm?

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*"Self-soothing, like winter crossing a river,
utterly undifferentiated, as if turbid—
this is how one embodies the Dao in the world.*
Only by embodying the Dao
does one move and remain still at the right times,
unburdened by things—
thus guarding stillness as a vessel.

Responding to things through movement,
one moves yet remains still,
ranging freely yet returning to their roots—
not lost in movement,
so movement does not scatter them—
who could muddy them?
They are established.
Responding and thus communicating,
established yet able to respond,
boundless yet fulfilling all demands—
not clinging to stillness,
so cessation does not obstruct them—
who could unsettle them?

That things cannot muddy them
is because stillness lets clarity arise gradually.
That things cannot unsettle them
is because movement lets life unfold slowly.

Stillness letting clarity arise gradually
is not to prize stillness as an end in itself,
nor to labor over life’s emergence as a feat.
Though overflowing, they do not lose their overflow,
swept along yet ever self-same—
how could ten thousand things perturb their mind?
Movement letting life unfold slowly
is not to labor over life’s emergence as a feat,
nor to force its emergence.
Not confined to one corner,
they emerge in due time to respond—
how could ten thousand things ensnare their thoughts?

Truly, *slowly* means to proceed with ease and self-adjustment,
in accord with the *Classic of Changes*’ *"Come slowly, slowly."*
Each movement and stillness,
following its natural course,
not contrary to principle,
entrusted to unfold naturally,
not contrary to nature—
all proceed with ease and self-adjustment.
Who then has cause for haste or labor?

If stillness implies cessation,
acting yet not ceasing is extreme,
ceasing yet not acting is also extreme.
Acting and ceasing in due measure,
not bound by things—
who could harm them?
For if bound by things, then it is cessation—
how could one respond to things without harm?

Those who preserve the Dao do not seek fullness.
The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*"There is accumulation, so there is insufficiency.
There is no hoarding, so there is abundance."*
The Perfect One has no accumulation—
only emptiness.

To preserve the Dao while claiming all the world’s beauty as one’s own
is already small-minded—
thus they do not seek fullness.
The *Classic* says:
*"Great whiteness seems like shame,
vast virtue seems insufficient."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*"Store grain in a granary—
when the grain is gone, the granary is empty.
Store water in a vessel—
when the water is gone, the vessel is empty.
Grass gathers things—
take from it as you will, yet it remains.
Praises gather things—
yet they sometimes run dry.
Because there is accumulation, there is insufficiency.
The Perfect One, boundless yet fulfilling all demands,
utterly empty yet responding to all reality—
because there is no hoarding, there is abundance.
The Dao flows without accumulation;
its use may not be full—
the Perfect One preserves the Dao without accumulation,
only emptiness.

If one claims all the world’s beauty as one’s own,
it is like monopolizing a ravine to be self-sufficient—
also small-minded.
When autumn waters arrive, the River Spirit rejoices,
yet is laughed at by those of great vision.
The *Classic* says:
*"Great whiteness seems like shame,
vast virtue seems insufficient."*
How could there be the burden of excess?

Only the unfull can renew without ceasing,
can complete without failing.
The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*"There is accumulation, so there is decay.
There is completion, so there is ruin.
New and decay alternate, like the four seasons;
completion and ruin follow, like all things.
From the Dao descending to forms and numbers,
none escape this.
Only the Dao has no form—
empty yet not full—
thus it can decay and renew,
complete and ruin,
transcending forms and numbers,
yet never decaying, never ruined.
Thus it is said:
Only the unfull can renew without ceasing,
can complete without failing.

Wood begins flourishing yet ends withered,
fire first shines yet finally extinguishes—
because there is renewal, decay follows.
The sun reaches its zenith and declines,
the moon is full and then wanes—
because there is completion, ruin follows.
The Daoist adept differs from this.

The *Explanatory Commentary* states:
*"Form brings renewal and decay,
numbers bring completion and ruin.
Spring precedes summer, waxing then waning—
the cycle of the four seasons follows this.
Speech and action alternate, flourishing then declining—
all affairs follow this.
These all fall within the realm of forms and numbers,
so when new, decay follows;
when complete, ruin comes—
none can escape it.
Only the Dao has no form,
unbound by shape—
thus it can renew and decay yet never decay,
unbound by numbers—
thus it can complete and ruin yet never ruin,
because it is empty yet not full.

Now, wood as a thing
flourishes in spring yet falls in winter—
thus it begins flourishing and ends withered.
Fire as a thing,
the more it is used, the brighter it burns,
yet when extinguished, it is gone—
thus it first shines and finally extinguishes.
Rising at dawn, setting at dusk—
though it is the essence of yang,
it cannot escape midday decline."*

The fullness of three and five wanes,
the emptiness of three and five returns—
though the moon is the essence of yin,
it cannot escape the fate of fullness leading to deficiency.

All that is confined to forms and numbers
thus has newness followed by decay,
completion followed by ruin—
this is why it must be so.
The Daoist attains emptiness yet never overflows,
transcending forms and numbers—
thus they can decay and renew yet never truly decay,
can complete and ruin yet never truly ruin,
because they are empty yet never depleted.

To attain emptiness to its utmost,
and to uphold tranquility with resolve—
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: Nothing is more precious than emptiness,
nothing more excellent than tranquility;
emptiness and tranquility are the root of all things.
Empty, they suffice to embrace all substance;
tranquil, they suffice to respond to all movement.
Utmost is where all gather and reach their limit;
resolve is where effort is fully exerted to its end.
To govern emptiness while seeking its limit,
and to uphold tranquility until resolve is achieved—
then though myriad appearances are varied,
my mind remains ever clear,
and though myriad transformations differ,
my mind remains ever still.
This is called *Heaven’s Music*—
only those who embody the Dao can partake in it.

*Explanatory commentary*: When one attains emptiness,
emptiness becomes vast—
vast, they can encompass all without omission,
thus *Liezi* says, "Nothing is more precious than emptiness."
When emptiness is attained,
tranquility follows—
tranquility brings clarity—
clarity allows them to illuminate all without exclusion,
thus *Liezi* says, "Nothing is more excellent than tranquility."
To be without obstruction is emptiness—
and nothing in the world escapes emptiness.
To remain unchanging in singularity is tranquility—
and nothing in the world’s movement departs from tranquility.
This is why *Zhuangzi* speaks of emptiness and tranquility
as the root of all things.
The *Classic* says: "O profound! Like the source of all things"—
it is no different from this.

For all things are hindered by form,
constrained by number—
bound by form, they become a burden of form;
bound by number, they become enslaved by number.
Only those who transcend form and depart from number
can achieve this—
is it not emptiness and tranquility?

Empty, they suffice to embrace all substance;
tranquil, they suffice to respond to all movement—
because they do not hinder form,
nor constrain by number.

Yet to explore the origin of emptiness and tranquility,
though naturally attained,
to achieve their fullness requires diligent governance and steadfastness.
When emptiness is attained to its limit,
and tranquility upheld with resolve—
then stillness and emptiness find their true dwelling.
Limit is like the apex of a house—
where all gather and reach their end.
Resolve is like a horse straining its utmost—
a thousand miles can be traversed,
for it is where effort is fully exerted to its end.

To attain emptiness to its limit
means to purge all external desires,
so not even a flaw is seen—
not only does nothing begin to exist,
but even the *non-beginning* of existence is transcended;
this is attaining emptiness to its limit.

To uphold tranquility with resolve
means to remain ever serenely still,
never disturbed—
not only to depart from movement and attain stillness,
but to be still even amid movement;
this is achieving resolve in tranquility.

When emptiness is attained to its limit without obstruction by substance,
and tranquility upheld with resolve without deviation by movement—
then though myriad appearances are varied,
my mind remains ever clear,
and though myriad transformations differ,
my mind remains ever still.

The myriad things, each with its own nature and artifice,
are called myriad appearances.
The restless threads of change,
unending and irregular,
are called myriad transformations.
Though myriad appearances vary,
the mind remains ever clear—
because emptiness suffices to contain them all.
*Clear* shares the same root as *mind’s clarity*—
the penetration of wisdom.

Though myriad transformations differ,
the mind remains ever still—
because tranquility suffices to respond to them.
*Still* shares the same root as *serene immobility*.

To attain emptiness and uphold tranquility,
fully achieving this,
is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth,
the perfection of Dao and virtue—
this is the *Great Root, Great Source*,
harmonizing with Heaven.
What greater *Heaven’s Music* is there?

Observing *Zhuang Zhou’s* discourse on emptiness and tranquility,
he says, "A single mind steadfast, and the world is ruled,"
and, "A single mind steadfast, and all things submit."
It is only by steadfastness that one can respond—
this is called *ever-clear, ever-still*,
the state of a single mind steadfast.

Only when the mind is steadfast can emptiness and tranquility
be extended to Heaven and Earth,
pervading all things—
how boundless is the joy?

When all things arise together,
I observe their return.
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: The transformations of all things
are at the end of the Dao;
those who embody the Dao dwell above all things.
Their birth springs from a germ—
their end returns to a destination.
When they surge forth along the path of movement,
I observe that the moving must eventually still,
and that the emerging must inevitably return—
thus I perceive the mind of Heaven and Earth,
remaining amidst all things yet not changing with them;
this is called observing their return.

*Explanatory commentary*: When *qi* transforms, form arises;
when form transforms, life emerges—
below the Dao, there is no movement without change.
Thus the transformations of all things
are at the end of the Dao.
The Sage embodies the Dao,
standing above all things,
unifying their principles and governing them—
this is why they dwell above all things.
Moreover, the birth of all things
is constrained by *creation and transformation*,
following sequence and order,
bridging and guiding one another—
emerging from *mechanism* and flowing in form,
then life has its origin in a germ,
entering *mechanism* and returning to essence,
then its end finds its destination.
If one lacks true sovereignty and does not grasp its manifestation,
when all things surge forth together,
they proceed along the path of *Kàn* (restraint),
reaching the vast thoroughfare of *Zhèn* (thunder),
sprouting and emerging,
germinating and becoming clear—
their myriad forms displayed,
rushing toward the path of movement.
The Sage comprehends the principles of all things,
within the midst of emptiness and tranquility,
gradually observing them broadly—
knowing that all things, though active,
originate from *non-action* and grow,
though moving, never depart from stillness,
though emerging, never truly fail to return.
Observing that the moving must eventually still,
and that the emerging must inevitably return—
thus I perceive the mind of Heaven and Earth.
In the *Yì* *Classic’s* *Fù* (Return) hexagram, it says:
"Return—
does it not reveal the mind of Heaven and Earth?"

The *Return* is indeed the moment when the small and subtle distinctions of things first emerge.
When distinctions emerge,
it is the state of utter stillness before any disturbance begins,
and nothing can exceed or evade it.

The Sage has no fixed mind,
but returns to the fundamental Dao of Heaven and Earth.
Though the world seems chaotic, it is sealed within harmony;
though it appears turbulent, it remains at peace.
In interacting with things yet not transforming with them,
it is not that one avoids interaction to attain distinction,
but rather that one distinguishes while interacting.

Thus, when all things arise together,
one observes their *Return*.
Though Laozi speaks of the *Return* as the "arising together,"
it is because there is a cessation of arising.

The principles may differ,
but their path to insightful observation is one and the same.

Things are myriad and varied,
each returning to its root.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"Myriad and varied"* refers to the forms of movement and emergence.
All things emerge from *Zhèn* (Thunder),
meet in *Lǐ* (Fire),
and thus arise together in myriad forms—
their radiant essence unfurling outward.
They delight in *Duì* (Joy),
toil in *Kǎn* (Abyss),
and then discard their brilliance for substance,
returning to their innate nature and dwelling.

*Life* is the root of *nature*,
and *nature* is the root of *fate*.
*Essence* is the mother of *spirit*,
and *spirit* is its child.
When essence is complete, spirit reigns supreme;
when nature is perfected, one attains fate.

The *Cushioned Explanation* says:
*"Things arise like the myriad grasses,*
slowly moving and emerging—
this is the image of myriad forms.
Yet the movement and emergence of things
each follow their own time.
Observing the cycles of the four seasons,
and the subtle transformations of the eight trigrams,
all things emerge with them yet do not refuse,
and all things return with them yet do not linger.
Thus, from spring to summer,
it is Heaven’s emergence and humanity’s reception;
from autumn to winter,
it is humanity’s return and Heaven’s acceptance.

Speaking of their emergence and humanity’s reception,
they arise from *Zhèn* (Thunder),
which governs the east and corresponds to spring—
when all things germinate and move.
They meet in *Lǐ* (Fire),
which governs the south and corresponds to summer—
when all things flourish and bloom,
thus the myriad forms arise together,
and their radiant essence unfurls outward.

Speaking of their return and Heaven’s acceptance,
they delight in *Duì* (Joy),
which governs the west and corresponds to autumn—
when all things reach their withered and gathered state;
they toil in *Kǎn* (Abyss),
which governs the north and corresponds to winter—
when all things return to their roots,
thus discarding brilliance for substance,
and returning to their innate nature and dwelling.

When myriad forms arise together,
it is the spring qi emerging and all grasses sprouting.
When their radiant essence unfurls outward,
then they grow and flourish.
When they discard brilliance for substance,
then autumn arrives and all treasures mature.
When they return to their innate dwelling,
then they vanish into the void of nothingness.

The *Yì Classic* says:
*"Each attains its own nature and fate,*
preserving the Great Harmony."

Those who cast the Great Pivot and congeal form
have already uniformly received nature and fate.
Zhuangzi says:
*"Spirit arises from the Dao,*
and form originates from essence."
Those who scatter and focus essence,
conceiving the vital qi,
have already harmonized spirit and nature.

Yet Heaven bestows upon me this *fate*,
and this *fate* within me is called *nature*.
To follow one’s fate,
one must first perfect one’s nature—
for *fate* is the root of *nature*,
and *nature* is the root of *fate*.

Humanity’s possession of life
begins with essence and follows with spirit.
To preserve one’s essence,
one must gather one’s spirit—
for *essence* is the mother of *spirit*,
and *spirit* is its child.

Only when one knows that nature attains fate,
can one return to the fundamental root,
preserving life without harming nature;
only when one gathers spirit through essence,
can one grasp the mother and know the child,
guarding it without loss.

When it is said that *essence complete, spirit reigns supreme*,
is it not through gathering spirit through essence?
When it is said that *perfecting nature attains fate*,
is it not through knowing nature attains fate?

Zhuangzi expounds on the Dao of pure simplicity,
beginning with the unity of essence and ending with
*"no depletion of spirit"*—
thus the perfection of essence and the supremacy of spirit are clear.

Mencius discusses the path of *exhausting the heart*,
beginning with *"nurturing nature to serve Heaven"*
and ending with *"cultivating the body to establish fate"*—
thus perfecting nature to attain fate is clear.

To grasp this truth,
one need only observe the *Return* as a secondary matter
in comprehending the principles of all things.

Returning to the root is called *stillness*,
and *stillness* is the *Return* to fate.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"Retaining movement to generate things,*
things generated manifest their principles—
this is called *form*.
*Form* preserves spirit,
each having its own measure—
this is called *nature*.
Before *form* emerges, there is division,
yet it arises naturally without pause—
this is called *fate*.
*Fate* spans antiquity to the present and remains constant,
*nature* changes through myriad forms yet does not alter,
and preserving the life of form—
the person who abandons knowledge and clings to the natural—
returns to tranquil repose.
Things cannot sway them."

The *Cushioned Explanation* says:
*"The realm retains movement to generate form,*
displaying true images of appearance and sound,
who does not receive the natural principles of things?
Zhuangzi calls this *form*—
the text speaks of the form of things as such.

The realm transforms to preserve spirit,
with flourishing, resounding, and complete vitality—
all enticed upward, who does not possess their inherent measures?
Zhuangzi calls this *nature*—
the *Book of Odes* says, *'Things have form and measure'*—
as such.

Life brings forth nature,
and nature brings forth form.
Before form emerges,
though there is division,
it arises naturally without pause—
this is what is called *fate*.

Life is called *nature*,
*nature* is received from *fate*,
*fate* endures without limit,
not bound by beginning or end,
nor constrained by time or measure—
it spans antiquity to the present and remains constant.

*Nature* accompanies life,
neither elevated nor diminished by noble or low,
neither increased nor lost by life or death—
it changes through myriad forms yet does not alter.

Only those who preserve the life of form
remain whole without decay,
embracing life without harm,
abandoning knowledge and clinging to the natural,
following Heaven’s principles,
returning to tranquil repose—
then things cannot sway them."

Abandon wisdom and old ways—
as when one is said to know nothing, rely on no cleverness.

Return to stillness and repose—
as when one is said to be motionless and tranquil, steadfast in great constancy.

Only thus does one know that *fate* abides within and does not transform with things.
Like spring turning to summer,
then autumn, then winter—
the active becomes still,
the creative rests,
and one knows where to cease.

Spring speaks of Heaven’s creation of things,
autumn of human completion,
summer of human caution,
winter of Heaven’s return.
From spring to summer,
Heaven’s essence descends to humanity;
from autumn to winter,
humanity returns to Heaven’s way.

Spring and summer precede,
autumn and winter follow—
gathering the scattered into unity,
stripping away the superficial to reveal the substance,
so that all flowing forms
return to their roots, unaware.

When *nature* is refined, it returns to *virtue*,
and *virtue* attains harmony with its origin—
thus it is.

If so, then one embodies *nature* and embraces *spirit*,
examining within to restore *fate*’s constancy—
what more could one desire?

Zhuangzi said:
*"Do nothing to return to simplicity,
embody nature and embrace spirit."*

To do nothing and return to simplicity
is to guard purity and naturalness,
thus one can embody *nature* and embrace *spirit*.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Thickly restore without regret,
examine within."*

To follow *nature* and deepen it
is to need nothing from without,
thus one can examine within.

Only thus does one remain serene and do nothing,
act in accordance with Heaven’s movement—
what hindrance is there to restoring *fate*?

The *Scripture of Mixed Creation* states:
*"Silent and vast,
independent yet unchanging.
Ending with ‘passing’ it calls ‘far’,
‘far’ it calls ‘return.’"*

It is to return to stillness and repose
that one may restore *fate*’s constancy.

Thus it is first said: *"Return to the root,"*
then: *"Restore fate."*

*Fate* restored is constancy.
The Huizong annotation says:
*"Constancy is the opposite of change."*

To restore *fate* is to be unmoved by myriad changes,
uninterrupted and ceaseless,
one with the Dao,
grasping Heaven and Earth,
inheriting the *qi*-mother.

The *Explication* says:
*"Observing the warp and weft of constancy and change,
the warp has a fixed form, hence it is constancy;
the weft intertwines and moves, hence it is change.
Constancy and change are like warp and weft—
thus constancy is the opposite of change."*

Yet what is constant in things is exhausted by constancy,
while what is constant in the Dao is sustained by change.
What is constant in things is worn out by constancy,
what is constant in the Dao endures through change.

Only by restoring *fate* does one return to origin and root,
enduring from antiquity—
neither the wave’s turbulence nor the depths’ stillness is inherently good or bad.
Though traversing countless changes beyond measure,
its true constancy remains unshaken—
this is what is meant by *"myriad changes cannot sway it."*

If so, then its *spirit* is unobstructed—
how could things enter it?
This is called *"no interval."*

It does not shift with time’s passage,
yet never ceases—
this is called *"no rest."*

Without interval or rest,
one with the Dao,
it spans antiquity to the present,
independent and unchanging,
as the Xīwéi lineage grasped Heaven and Earth,
enduring eternally,
as Fuxi inherited the *qi*-mother,
boundless in duration.

Its constancy cannot be surpassed.

To know constancy is clarity.
The Huizong annotation says:
*"Knowing the Dao’s constancy,
unmoved by things,
the six orifices act in harmony,
sufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth,
sufficient to illuminate all things."*

The *Explication* says:
*"Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness.
The Dao’s constancy does not shift with things—
this is achieved through stillness alone.
Only stillness prevents it from rushing with movement.
Amidst the flourishing of all things,
one observes their return;
amongst their teeming forms,
one knows their roots.
Observing return and roots,
its stillness cannot be overturned by anything."*

Thus the six orifices act in harmony,
sufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth,
sufficient to illuminate all things.
The *orifices* are unobstructed by things—
the eye, unclouded by color, sees clearly and is bright;
the ear, unobstructed by sound, hears distinctly and is keen;
the nose, unobstructed by scent, perceives fragrance as *tian*;
the mouth, unobstructed by taste, finds sweetness;
the mind, unobstructed by thought, attains knowledge;
knowledge, unobstructed by things’ principles, attains *virtue*—
this is what is called the *"six orifices acting in harmony."*

From eye to knowledge,
the six act in sequence without obstruction,
through emptiness and unity, through stillness.

Emptiness brings stillness,
stillness brings clarity,
clarity lets *spirit* flow freely in all directions,
reaching extremes without limit.
Ascending to Heaven, descending to Earth,
transforming and nurturing all things—
beyond representation.

Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
they can be observed here;
though myriad things abound,
they can be shaped here.

Stillness is the balance of Heaven and Earth,
the illumination of all things—
only those who know constancy can attain this.

To not know constancy is reckless action—
disaster.

The Huizong annotation says:
*"The sage knows the Dao’s constancy,
so actions align with principle,
always meeting with good fortune.
Those who do not know constancy
follow things’ shifts,
entangled in misfortune,
thus they mistakenly judge good and evil,
contradicting the Dao,
mistakenly generate right and wrong,
diverging from the Dao,
and cannot even preserve their own *fate*—
hence disaster."*

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"To restore is to act without error;
lost, one does not know to restore."*

This is recklessness.

The *Explication* says:
*"When the heart aligns with the Dao,
action is without falsehood;
when the heart departs from the Dao,
movement is without fail.
The sage is the Dao’s fulfillment,
thus knowing its constancy and not shifting with things.
Actions align with principle,
no movement is false,
always meeting with good fortune,
no step is taken without examining omens—
to act with *virtue* and rest the heart is called *rest*,
to do good and receive a hundred blessings."*

「Those who do not know the *constant Dao*,
act without fail—this is recklessness.
The farther one strays from the Dao,
the more one conflicts with its manifestations,
wandering with things and shifting with circumstances,
thus they say, *"to battle with the heart"*—
stumbling into misfortune, hence their reckless judgment of good and evil.

Drawn by personal likes and dislikes,
they fail to recognize that all good and evil arise from a single principle,
thus they contradict the Dao,
mistakenly creating distinctions of right and wrong.
Confused by false praise and blame,
they do not know to transform right and wrong through *twofold forgetting*,
thus they diverge from the Dao.

For the Dao cannot be separated for even a moment.
Once one contradicts it and diverges from it,
they exhaust their form and nature,
ravage *yin* and *yang*,
and cannot even preserve their own *fate*—
no greater calamity exists, hence disaster.

The *Classic of Changes* in its *"Sequence of the Hexagrams"* says:
*"To restore is to act without error."*
This means that when one restores the small and discerns through things,
it is called *without recklessness*.

*Without recklessness* is the mandate of Heaven,
to which all things submit.
Thus its *symbol* states:
*"When thunder rolls beneath the heavens,
things align with *without recklessness*."*
*Without recklessness*, things attain their true nature.

But when one is lost and cannot restore,
they lose their nature and reach its end,
unable to nurture life—
this is recklessness indeed.

**Knowing the constant Dao, one attains *rest*.**
The *Explication* says:
*"He who knows the Dao’s true constancy
sees that all things arise from One.
Thus, when observing the world,
though myriad and conflicting,
all are equally the utmost marvel—
who can distinguish right and wrong, good and evil?

To reject what is wrong and uphold what is right
arises from clinging to fixed views;
to love what is good and hate what is evil
arises from indulging private desires.
The perfected sage abandons the burden of fixed views,
forgets right and wrong,
and transcends private desires,
harmonizing good and evil—
this is no other than knowing the constant Dao.

To know the constant Dao is to empty oneself and wander through the world,
achieving flawlessness.
Right and wrong, good and evil do not dwell in the heart,
thus one can embrace all without exclusion.

The sage’s governance empties the heart—
this is how.

**Embracing all is *public*.**
The *Explication* says:
*"Without a heart of embracing,
one does not solely love one’s own kin,
nor solely cherish one’s own children—
what private desires remain?

To perceive things through their forms
is to indulge private desires;
to merge with the Dao without heart
is to attain universal harmony.
Thus the sage governs the world as a family,
nurtures all people equally,
and without a heart of embracing,
loves without limit,
showers mercy without bounds—
what private desires remain?

Even Heaven and Earth, when viewed,
cover all without partiality,
bear all without discrimination—
all within the realm of the two cannot escape their embrace.
Thus embracing all is *public*—
this is how the sage is seen in Heaven and Earth.

**Being *public* is *royal*.**
The *Explication* says:
*"The Dao’s practice is universal,
what all people share and follow—
this is what the *Records of Rites* cite,
the words of Zhongni,
explaining why the Dao’s practice is universal,
and the world rejoices in its embrace without weariness.

The essence of governance lies in knowing the Dao,
while the sage’s Way serves all hearts.
The sage governs the world through the Dao,
receives the Dao with the heart—
thus people are drawn to emulate and return to them,
their sincerity and service flowing naturally,
enduring forever without ceasing,
as the world willingly embraces it without restraint.

This is what the *Classic of Changes* means by:
*'The people align with what is able.'*

**Royal is Heaven, Heaven is the Dao.**
The *Explication* says:
*"Heaven and Earth establish their positions,
the sage fulfills their abilities—
within the realm, the Four Great Ones,
the king stands at their center.

This is he who unites Heaven, Earth, and people,
standing at the center of all—
the king.

One is not separate from the realm of numbers,
but the origin of all counts;
Great is not separate from form,
but the culmination of all bodies.
Light and clarity reside above,
broadly covering and embracing—
this is One, great above, without exclusion—
Heaven.

Heaven attains it and fulfills its mandate to cover with *qi*,
Earth attains it and fulfills its role to bear with form,
The sage attains it and fulfills teaching and transformation—
this is what all Heaven, Earth, and people follow—
the Dao.

The king is the ultimate of human Dao.
If one exhausts the human Dao,
they align with Heaven—
is this not *exhausting all people aligns with Heaven*?

Zhuangzi says:
*'The king is the Dao of Heaven.'*
Thus, the king is Heaven—
this is clear.

Heaven is the great source of the Dao.
If one takes Heaven as their origin,
they merge with the Dao—
is this not *embodying Heaven aligns with the Dao*?

The *Classic* says:
*'Heaven follows the Dao.'*
Thus, Heaven is the Dao—
this is clear.

The *Book of Poetry*’s *"Great Odes"* speak of
*the silent and odorless* yet call it *"the model and punishment of King Wen"*—
King Wen’s deeds truly aligned with Heaven.
To explore Heaven’s Dao,
one must follow the model and punishment of King Wen alone.

This is *exhausting all people aligns with Heaven*.

Again, it speaks of
*the unknowing and unperceiving* yet calls it *"following the Emperor’s standard"*—
the marvelous Dao’s practice truly aligns with Heaven.
To seek the Dao’s marvel,
one must follow the Emperor’s standard alone.

This is *embodying Heaven aligning with the Dao*.

The Zhou dynasty’s prosperity
came from the sage’s clarity and the people’s reverence,
guarding the same Dao,
sung in the *Book of Songs*—
this is how the Three Dynasties shone,
and kings always attain this.

**The Dao is enduring;**
one who follows it does not perish in life.
The *Explication* says:
*"The Dao endures through ten thousand ages,
all things attaining it flourish—
it encompasses all sages without limit,
spans Heaven and Earth without ceasing—
thus one who follows it does not perish in life.

Perishing is near to disaster,
nearness is close to fortune—
not perishing means no reckless action leads to disaster,
and none but those who know the constant Dao can achieve this."*」

The *Explication* states:
*"Its blessings extend to ten thousand generations,
outlasting the ancient past—
this is the Dao’s enduring nature,
and thus it knows no decay across ages.

What is meant by ‘gathering the past to secure existence’
is that it bends to fulfill without omission,
flows and measures without depletion—
thus all things that attain it flourish.

The Sage embodies the Dao as its ultimate expression,
refining through ten thousand years into perfect unity—
thus it encompasses all sages without end.

Spanning past and future without decay,
it encompasses Heaven and Earth without ceasing.
All things coexist harmoniously without harm—
who could threaten them?
Truly, one who follows it does not perish in life.

Disaster arises from negligence,
and thus is near to calamity—
as the saying goes: *‘Negligence overcomes reverence, and the dike is breached.’*

Fortune comes from vigilance,
and thus is near to blessing—
as the saying goes: *‘Fortune’s warning is its first sign.’*

To avoid disaster means all actions align with principle,
ever meeting with fortune,
and shunning reckless deeds that invite calamity.

None but the keen-witted and sagely wise,
sufficiently attuned to the Dao’s constancy,
can achieve this.

**Chapter Seventeen of the *Taishang* Section**
*The Taishang*—
the lowly know its existence."*

The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"To govern the world with leniency, one attains tranquility with all under Heaven. Without the joy of striving, praise does not reach him; without the toil of exhaustion, fear of regret does not come. Actions occur without effort, yet they are ever natural—thus the lowly know its existence."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"The world has its inherent nature, and that nature has its inherent virtue. To abide within it is to preserve without perishing—this prevents excess; to yield to it is to release without abandoning—this guards against deviation. If one does not exceed its nature nor alter its virtue, then the world will transform of itself, and one attains serenity with all under Heaven. The Sage governs the world through the Dao, ever ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desire—so that even the wise dare not act. Though people may possess knowledge, there is no use for it; how then could there be the joy of striving or the labor of exhaustion? Without the joy of striving, the heart remains undisturbed, and praise does not reach him; without the labor of exhaustion, the heart remains at ease, and fear of slander does not come. Without desire yet self-sufficient, without action yet naturally settled, effortlessly expansive and harmonious—one attains what one attains without doing, for this is the way of forgetting in the Dao. This is what is meant by ‘the lowly know its existence.’ As Mencius said of the ruler’s people: ‘Their virtue shines like the sun and moon.’ Only at this moment is this true.

*"Next comes the state of being praised and honored. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, all under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—thus he is honored. His renown rises like the sun and moon—thus he is praised. This is the governance of the sage-king, where the traces of praise and honor are manifest, yet the Way of Great Unity is lost.

*"Zhuangzi said: ‘Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people rejoiced in him.’ The *Odes* speak of the people of King Wen first gathering at Lingtai. The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"Nothing benefits the people more than benevolence. Shun’s virtue of cherishing life permeated the hearts of the people; in the Zhou, governance was refined and benevolence was applied—this is the benevolence extending to the people. Nothing establishes order better than law. Shun established laws for all under Heaven, which could be passed down to future generations; in the Zhou, all affairs were fully attended to—this is the law enduring for the ages. When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, ruling with such care is like nurturing an infant. All under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—who would not cherish and honor him? When such governance is applied, his fame spreads far and wide, his renown rises like the sun and moon—who would not rejoice and praise him? The rise of the sage-emperor and the completion of the sage-king’s work—his virtue and deeds surpass all under Heaven, beyond concealment. None have not rooted themselves in this, which is why the governance of the sage-king bears the clear traces of praise and honor. Yet if this is so, then the Way of Great Unity is diminished, and there is a question between this and ‘the lowly know its existence.’

*"Indeed, in Great Unity, the people have no knowledge, no desire—how then could there be praise and honor? In ancient times, Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people of Dengxu came in tens of thousands; King Wen’s spiritual virtue made the people joyful, and the *Odes* of Lingtai marked the beginning of their allegiance. The means by which the sage-king’s governance brings praise and honor is this. Yet the Sage does not truly intend the people’s praise and honor. When great virtue and mighty deeds are bestowed upon the world, praise and honor naturally follow, without expectation.

*"Next comes the state of being feared and reviled. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"He governs with laws and unifies with punishments—thus he is feared. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There were lords like the Duke of Chu questioning the weight of the tripod, and ministers like Yang Hu stealing great bows and jade—these are the customs of a declining age, hence he is reviled."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"The Sage governs the world through the Dao, and laws and punishments, rewards and penalties, serve only to assist the Dao in its practice. Laws and punishments clarify the world’s defenses, so the people have something to uphold; rewards and penalties demonstrate the world’s preferences, so the people know what to avoid—all rooted in the Dao. If one relies solely on laws and punishments without the Dao, it may reform outward appearance but cannot transform the heart—thus he is feared, and even reviled.

*"To govern through virtue is already to govern through laws. To govern through laws is to lack virtue. To unify through ritual is already to unify through punishments. To unify through punishments is to lack ritual. To govern through laws and unify through punishments is to be feared because the people’s hearts are scattered. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There are those like the Duke of Chu and Yang Hu who revile, for they do not know the Dao’s governance of the world. If laws are used to govern and punishments to defend, and if legal measures are clear—so that rewards are given without encouragement and punishments without fear—then encouragement and deterrence are naturally aligned with the Dao. This is not the lesser path of deficiency, but the greater path where the Dao still endures. Thus, trust is insufficient, and distrust arises.

*"The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"What binds and separates is not done with glue and lacquer; what restrains and loosens is not done with ropes and cords—this is the utmost trust. When the Shang made oaths, the people began to doubt; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt—this is because trust was insufficient. When the Sage’s governance is such that ‘the lowly know its existence,’ then actions align without the people knowing it as trust. Next comes the state of being feared and reviled, where cunning, deceit, and scheming arise, and distrust follows.

*"The *Classic* says: ‘Within it lies trust.’ Thus, trust comes naturally. As Zhuangzi said: ‘What binds and separates is not done with glue and lacquer; what restrains and loosens is not done with ropes and cords’—this is the utmost trust, obtained naturally."*

*The Classic of Rites* says: **"Great trust requires no binding."**
Thus, trust is naturally sincere in others, needing no coercion or command.

*The Classic of Rites* also states: *"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt."* This is because trust was insufficient, relying on coercion and command.

Indeed, **ultimate trust** arises from what is inherently true—never giving rise to doubt. When trust is insufficient, it loses its essential truth, and thus distrust arises.

In the **highest governance**, the people, in their natural simplicity, are unaware of its presence, yet their actions align without knowing it as trust. In the next stage, when they are feared and scorned, their customs decay, the pure and genuine disperse, and the vulgar and artful emerge—thus, deceit and scheming arise, and distrust follows.

*The Book of Changes* says: **"Without words, yet trusted—this lies in virtue and conduct."**
For when the essence is profound and the heart is in accord, this is called **ultimate trust**. But if one resorts to cunning and deceit, confusing the people with clever arguments and shamelessness, what trust remains? It is because trust was insufficient.

**Ah! How precious are words.**
The **Emperor’s commentary** says: *"When viewed through the Dao, the ruler of the world is upright—how then can words be spoken lightly?"* One must be cautious and never reckless. Thus, when words are spoken, they become the Dao for the world; when conduct is carried out, they transform the world.

The **explanatory notes** say: *"Words are words, but their meaning is not yet fixed."* When viewed through the Dao, the speaker has never truly spoken—only the true ruler exists in stillness, thus the world’s ruler is upright. Words are like waves—how then can they be spoken lightly? One must be cautious and never reckless. Words cannot be spoken lightly—that is what ‘Ah! How precious!’ means. Words must not be spoken lightly—that is what ‘precious words’ means.

The ancients inscribed warnings on golden statues and guarded against blemishes on white jade—thus it is clear that words cannot be spoken lightly. Therefore, the Sage speaks, and the people do not doubt; thus, words become the Dao for the world. When one reveals the truth and acts accordingly, conduct becomes the Dao in itself, transforming the world.

Why is this so? Because when spoken, it resonates with the law; when acted upon, it aligns with the Way—thus, none under the heavens fail to be sincere. When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled, the people say, *"This is natural to us."* The **Emperor’s commentary** says: *"The achievements of the Sage are the remnants of the Emperor’s work."* To make the people relish their food, admire their clothing, find comfort in their customs, and take joy in their livelihoods—these are the remnants sufficient to fulfill the Emperor’s achievements.

Yet they say, *"This is natural to us,"* as if the Emperor’s power had no part in it. This is called **the highest governance**.

The **explanatory notes** say: *"The Emperor’s work is accomplished without action, yet the world’s affairs are fulfilled—only the traces remain, as if naturally so. This is called the Emperor’s achievements, the Sage’s remnants."* When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled, the heavens are at ease, and the people dwell in peace and tranquility. They have no need to exert their cleverness—only to relish their food, admire their clothing, find comfort in their customs, and take joy in their livelihoods.

Food is taken in moderation, hence relished;
Clothing follows proper adornment, hence admired;
Customs are undisturbed, hence comfortable;
Livelihoods sustain life, hence joyous.

All these are the remnants of the Sage’s work, sufficient to fulfill the Emperor’s achievements. Thus, the people say, *"We use it without knowing,"* and claim, *"The Emperor’s power has no part in us."*

In ancient times, when **Emperor Yao** governed the world, there was the song of the broad streets: *"None but the extreme!"*—this was the **highest governance** of that time.

**End of Volume Four of the Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing**
**Beginning of Volume Five of the Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing**

**Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing by Jiang Rong, Student of the Imperial Daoist Academy**

**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao and Virtue/Power in Decline**

When the Great Dao declines, there arises **virtue** and **righteousness**;
The **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *"When the Dao is lost, then virtue emerges; when virtue is lost, then righteousness arises; when righteousness is lost, then propriety follows. Righteousness establishes others, propriety establishes oneself—yet this is ever farther from the Dao."*

**Han Yu** failed to grasp the Sage’s true intent regarding **Dao** and **virtue/power**, instead claiming that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names, while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are mere empty positions. The **Master Lao**’s minor **virtue** and **righteousness** reflect a limited perspective—what **Zhuang Zi** called the *"veiled and ignorant folk."*

The **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *"The fullness of the Dao lies hidden in the undifferentiated chaos, while virtue/power is a division of the Dao, manifesting as the interplay of firmness and yielding. Since the Dao cannot be fully attained, its loss gives rise to virtue/power. Since virtue/power cannot be fully realized, its decline spawns righteousness. Righteousness can be cultivated, and when cultivated, it approaches propriety—thus, when righteousness is lost, propriety emerges, making one ever more distant from the Dao. In its essence, the Dao is singular—just as **Yang Zi** said: *‘When unified, it is whole; when divided, it scatters.’* Han Yu, failing to grasp the Sage’s intent, resorted to subjective distortion, positing that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are empty terms. He labeled the **Master Lao**’s minor **righteousness** as a narrow view, yet he did not realize that the **Seven Virtues** are all contained within **Dao** and **virtue/power**. If **Dao** and **virtue/power** do not decline, why would one need the **Seven Virtues**? Examining the root, even if one rejects **virtue** and **righteousness**, they already operate within the realm of **Dao** and **virtue/power**. Could his heart truly believe that **virtue** and **righteousness** are insufficient for governing the world? His minor **virtue** and **righteousness** are merely a means to elevate them—precisely what **Zhuang Zi** called the *‘veiled and ignorant folk.’*

Later generations, obscured by worldly learning, lacked higher insight. Upon hearing the **Master Lao**’s teachings, they either dismissed them as madness or defamed them as crude and shallow. In the final age, scholars spend their lives in vain, only to become **petty Confucianists**—Han Yu’s critique is well-founded.

When wisdom and insight emerge, there arises **great deceit**;
The **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *"When the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, deceit follows."*

The **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *"In an age of perfect virtue/power, the people act without knowing why, move without knowing where they go. They follow their nature and find contentment; they accept their lot and remain at peace. Ambition and craft are forgotten. What need have the people’s hearts for wisdom and strength? When desire and calculation first arise, external temptations lure them. When wisdom fails, they grow perplexed; when strength fails, they grow sluggish. Losing their natural state, they sink into artificial contrivance—this is when the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, and deceit takes over. The Sage, in governing with forbearance, seeks to restore the people to their natural state, yet does not rule through wisdom and strength alone. Thus, **Lie Zi** says: *‘The Sage relies on the Dao’s transformation, not on wisdom and cleverness.’*

When familial bonds are fractured, there arises **filial piety and kindness**;
When the state is in chaos, there arise **loyal ministers**.

The Emperor Huizong annotated: *"Names arise from insufficiency."*

Zhuangzi said: *"A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord."* This is the peak of the subject’s virtue.

The *Cushui* commentary states: *"A name is the guest of reality. If reality is present, the name follows naturally. Yet names always arise from insufficiency."*

When a gentleman achieves renown, nothing surpasses loyalty and filial piety. Serving one’s parents, he does not choose a place to settle—this is filial piety. If he merely agrees with his parents’ words and approves of their deeds to flatter them, this is not true filial piety. Serving his lord, he does not choose a task to undertake—this is loyalty. If he merely agrees with his lord’s words and approves of his deeds to fawn upon him, this is not true loyalty. Only when he neither flatters his parents nor fawns upon his lord does the heart of loyalty and filial piety reach its fullness—this is the peak of the subject’s virtue.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**

Discard the Sage and abandon wisdom, and the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.

The Emperor Huizong annotated: *"The Dao aligns with nature, unified without mixture. Departing from the Dao to establish virtue is what is called sage-wisdom. When sage-wisdom stands, then the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Shocking the ignorant to reveal the filthy, praising Yao while condemning Jie—then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great. If one discards and abandons it, aligning with the Dao as one body, then each finds peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Its benefit is vast."*

The *Cushui* commentary states: *"At the origin of reception, nature and the Dao are indistinct. After reception, nature and the Dao diverge. Only when indistinct with the Dao is there no distinction—this is the ‘Dao aligning with nature, unified without mixture.’ Only when diverging from the Dao are there boundaries—this is the ‘departing from the Dao to establish virtue, what is called sage-wisdom.’"*

At the origin of nature, the subtle root is complete and whole. Sage and fool alike initially share no distinction. Those who depart from the Dao externally establish their virtue, losing the true and sinking into artifice, lost and never returning. Thus, the ignorant display wisdom, and the name of the Sage arises. When sage-wisdom stands, they cannot follow nature’s spontaneity, and the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Arrogance leads to excess; obscurity plunges into depth; fierceness defies reach; eccentricity stands apart—none are the conduct of simplicity and rectitude. Thus, they adorn wisdom to shock the ignorant, refine themselves to reveal the filthy, praise Yao while condemning Jie, yet they do not know to forget all and transform in the Dao. Then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great—this aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *"Do you delight in the Sage? Then you are like the man who admires a withered tree. Do you delight in wisdom? Then you are like the man who admires a blemish."*

Only when one knows to discard and abandon it, aligning with the Dao as one body, does one follow nature’s spontaneity and bring the world to governance through non-action. Only then does one find peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Truly, when the people return to simplicity and find peace in their nature and life, they align with the age and attain tranquility—can their benefit be calculated? Indeed, this is what is meant by *"its benefit is vast."*

**Discard Benevolence and Abandon Righteousness, and the People Return to Filial Piety and Kindness.**

The Emperor Huizong annotated: *"Filial piety and kindness are innate nature. To hobble for benevolence, to tiptoe for righteousness—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people will return to their nature and restore their origin, not merely loving their own parents, not merely cherishing their own children—what then is filial piety and kindness?"*

The *Cushui* commentary states: *"All conduct stems from filial piety as its root; the three treasures prioritize kindness first. The heart of filial piety and kindness arises from innate nature, not from artificiality or external imposition. As for hobbling for benevolence—conduct is unnatural—and tiptoeing for righteousness—effort is forced—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people’s nature will refine and return to virtue, virtue reaching back to its origin—this is returning to nature and restoring the beginning. If so, then the Great Dao is practiced, and the world is held in common: not merely loving one’s own parents, but extending care to all elders; not merely cherishing one’s own children, but nurturing all youth. Loving one another without knowing it as benevolence, uprightness without knowing it as righteousness—then filial piety and kindness belong to all, scarcely knowing why it is so."*

**Discard Artifice and Abandon Gain, and Thieves and Robbers Will Cease.**

The Emperor Huizong annotated: *"Those who practice cunning artifice have no shame. Those with desires for gain disregard righteousness. These are all of the ‘borrowed’ kind."*

The *Cushui* commentary states: *"Without shame for vice, there is no way to know shame. Without knowing shame, there is no way to practice righteousness. For a person to be human, it is noble to act with shame and to prioritize righteousness when seeing gain. If one understands this, then one will not do what should not be done and will not desire what should not be desired, returning to the path of the gentleman. As for those who practice cunning artifice, their purity is incomplete, and the Dao does not record them—this is having no shame. As for those with desires for gain, they rely on benevolence while stepping on righteousness, counterfeit the true with the false—this is disregarding righteousness. Having no shame and disregarding righteousness, they do what should not be done and desire what should not be desired. Truly, few differ from those who take what is not theirs. This is why they are said to be of the ‘borrowed’ kind."*

These three principles—though insufficient as doctrine—are thus assigned their place.

The Emperor Huizong annotated: *"The ancient kings governed the world through humanity. By the Zhou, refinement grew excessive, and by its decline, ornament overran substance, with ornament in excess while substance was insufficient. The world lost its original simplicity and sank into the habits of private desire. Laozi, in the late Zhou, sought to loosen these flaws and restore them to their root. Thus, he discarded benevolence and righteousness, abandoned ritual and learning—even sage-wisdom was to be rejected."*

Was his heart truly convinced that the Seven Virtues of sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world? The Way of the ancient kings, like the cycle of seasons, returns again. To rely on refinement (*wén*), one must first establish substance (*zhì*), hence their proper place. This is what is meant by "seeing the unadorned and embracing simplicity, reducing private desires and minimizing wants."

**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**
Cold accumulates to become heat—not in a single day. Observing the rhythms of heaven to understand human affairs, we see that the ancient kings governed the world through humanity, progressing from simplicity to fullness, until by the Zhou, refinement grew excessive. At that time, institutions were established for every matter, and intricate regulations were set to guard against excess. Never was refinement more elaborate. Yet when refinement reaches its extreme, it leads to decay—substance is lost. There was too much emphasis on ornament while substance was insufficient, and the world lost its original simplicity, withering into falsehood. It sank into private desires and was obscured by petty wisdom—how could one not address this decay?

Laozi, in the late Zhou, sought to ease these flaws and restore them to their root. His intent lay here. Thus, he discarded the Seven Virtues and returned to the natural state, abandoning ritual and learning to merge in Daoist practice—even sage-wisdom was rejected, no longer held in esteem. He wished the world to value the fundamental over the superficial, to loosen rigid adherence to the past. Was his heart truly convinced that benevolence and sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world?

The Xia emphasized loyalty, the Shang simplicity, and the Zhou refinement—sometimes adapting, sometimes revolutionizing, sometimes diminishing, sometimes adding. The Way of the ancient kings, like the seasons, returns in cycles. Yet when refinement falters, it must be restored by substance, just as summer returns to autumn. To rely on refinement, one must first establish substance—hence their proper place.

**Seeing the Unadorned (*Jiànsù*):**
Emperor Huizong annotated: *"The Analects say: 'Painting begins with the blank canvas.' Before receiving color, the blank canvas is pure and unadorned."*
**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**
Painting begins with the blank canvas, hence the Analects say, *"Painting begins with the blank canvas."* Before receiving color, the blank canvas is white. When color is applied, the original purity is obscured—this is the true nature of things. It is called *sù* because it remains unstained by external influences. To see the unadorned is to be clearly enlightened, without blemish, inwardly complete, and free from deceit—this is purity without admixture. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *"clear and entering the unadorned"* and the idea that *sù* means unmixed.

**Embracing Simplicity (*Bàopǔ*):**
Emperor Huizong annotated: *"The Classic says: 'The undifferentiated (*pǔ*) disperses to become things.' If the undifferentiated is not carved, embracing simplicity means stillness and unity without change."*
Zhuangzi said: *"To align with desirelessness is called simplicity."* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.

**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**
Things derive from simplicity as their root, hence the Classic says, *"The undifferentiated disperses to become things."* If the undifferentiated is not carved, its form remains whole, untouched by artificial refinement. Simplicity is the true nature of things. It is called *pǔ* because it is uncarved, relying only on human artifice. To embrace simplicity is to be sincere and whole, returning to natural spontaneity, tranquil and at ease—this is stillness and unity without change. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *"pure and unbroken simplicity."* Thus, simplicity is the people’s natural state. Restoring this natural state means desirelessness, self-fulfillment, and aligning with Zhuangzi’s *"to align with desirelessness is called simplicity."* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.

**Reducing Private Desires and Minimizing Wants (*Shǎosī-guǎyù*):**
Emperor Huizong annotated: *"Self-seeking is private; nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants."*
Reducing private desires and minimizing wants clarifies the distinction between inner and outer, discerns true from false, preserves virtue whole, and restores true nature—thus the title of sage-wisdom fades.

**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**
To be obscured by self-interest is to lose the greater harmony. Self-seeking is private. To be entangled in desires is to drown in agitation. Nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants. Private desires and wants are external distractions, not inner reflections—they cultivate falsehood, not true nature. Only by reducing private desires and minimizing wants can one distinguish inner from outer, know what to value, discern true from false, preserve virtue uncorrupted, and restore true nature. Thus, in non-action and effortless action, the title of sage-wisdom vanishes—who then governs the world?

**Chapter 20: "Discarding Learning, There Is No Worry" (*Juéxué-wúyōu*):**
Emperor Huizong annotated: *"Learning seeks to exhaust principles. While striving to exhaust principles through learning, how can one avoid worry over right and wrong, success and failure in governance?"*
Learning leads to the Dao. When one attains the Dao, learning is discarded—reducing further, reducing until non-action yet nothing remains undone. One follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy without end, thus free from worry.

**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**
*Li* is like a boundary that can be measured; only through learning can one explore its depths. *Dao* is like a path all share; only by discarding learning can one reach its utmost.

Learning seeks to exhaust principles—this is the beginning of learning, hence the Classic says, *"In learning, there is daily increase."* While striving to exhaust principles through learning, one deliberates over right and wrong within the heart, examines governance through past and present—this is not yet free from the burden of thought. How can one avoid worry? Confucius worried about learning not being practiced—this is it.

Learning leads to the Dao—this is the end of learning, hence the Classic says, *"In the Dao, there is daily reduction."* When one attains the Dao and discards learning, limbs are discarded, senses are abandoned, form and knowledge are set aside, and all affairs vanish. Reducing further, reducing until nothing remains—then in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Thus, motionless yet responsive, one follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy in forgetfulness, joy without end—thus free from worry.

Confucius took delight in coarse rice and water, finding joy therein—this is it.

Master Wenzi said: *"The heart has no discontent."*

Without discontent yet acting without end, this may be called attaining the Dao.

Thus, as the Dao is daily reduced, one finds joy in the Dao here—this is clear.

How far apart are *"unique"* and *"affirmative"*?
How different are *"good"* and *"evil"*?

Huizong annotated:
*"Unique" and "affirmative"* share the same sound;
*"Good"* and *"evil"* stem from one nature.
The petty-wise cling to self, separating them into two.
The enlightened embrace the whole—
their essence is not truly distinct.

The Sage governs the world in ancestral temples and courts.
Speaking to the great officers, he does not speak uniformly thus—
suppressing evil and promoting virtue, fearing it may not be thorough.
What people fear, one cannot fail to fear—this is so.

The *Cushui* explains:
If one merges the Dao with things, then distinctions arise from concealment.
If one divides things by the Dao, then distinctions arise from establishment.
Speaking from human inclination,
*"Unique"* is reverence, *"affirmative"* is arrogance.
Good lies in what is cherished, evil in what is despised—
this is inherently different.

Yet observing principle,
*"Unique"* and *"affirmative"* emerge from one sound,
*"Good"* and *"evil"* merge in one nature—
what then distinguishes them?

The petty-wise, clinging to self, follow their emotions.
Following emotion and self, each plants their own perspective,
arbitrarily drawing boundaries—
this is what is meant by *"separating into two."*

The enlightened embrace principle.
Embracing principle to observe,
they encompass all particulars,
unifying them in supreme subtlety—
this is what is meant by *"essence not truly distinct."*

The Sage merges his heart with the Dao,
seeing no singular thing,
yet toward the world’s good and evil,
he does not remain indifferent—
for he does not wish to differ from the world.

Thus, when he emerges to govern,
in ancestral temples and courts,
he readily distinguishes governance as his task;
speaking to lesser officers, he maintains harmonious discourse;
speaking to greater officers, he shows reverent deference.
Thus, he adapts to emotions through ritual,
and through ritual distinguishes differences—
hence his speech is not uniform.

If so, then evil is suppressed, virtue is exalted,
judging the world’s right and wrong with impartiality,
demonstrating the world’s likes and dislikes—
fearing it may not be thorough,
he takes heed of what people fear,
and cannot fail to fear—
bowing to align with them.

What people fear, one cannot fail to fear.
Huizong annotated:
*"The Dao stirs all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry.*
*Calamity and fortune breathe with the people—this is governance.*
*Those who embody the Dao have no worry;*
*those who engage in affairs have reverence."*

What people fear, yet failing to take warning,
few can avoid exhaustion.
Thus, the virtuous cultivate through awe and reflection.

The *Classic of Poetry* says: *"Fear the might of Heaven."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"Responding in accord is the Dao.*
*The Dao requires no thought or deliberation—*
*it stirs all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry,*
*this is what is meant by ‘motionless yet responsive.’*
*Acting in concealment is governance.*
*Governance involves thought and action—*
*calamity and fortune breathe with the people,*
*this is what is meant by ‘responding to the world’s affairs.’*
*Those who embody the Dao retreat to accompany Heaven,*
*thus they have no worry;*
*those who engage in affairs emerge to interact with people,*
*thus they have reverence.*

What people fear, yet failing to take warning,
few can avoid exhaustion.
Only with solemn vigilance does one achieve reverence,
and with diligent caution does one attain prudence—
then action will surely lead to auspiciousness,
without fear of regret or hesitation.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"The virtuous cultivate through awe and reflection."*
The *Classic of Poetry* says: *"Fear the might of Heaven."*
These are the utmost warnings.

Indeed, cultivating through awe and reflection,
thinking to prevent exhaustion—
like Boyi’s vigilance without worry—
fearing Heaven’s might,
to preserve the world—
like Gaozong’s stern reverence—
observing this, one knows
what people fear cannot fail to be feared—
its principle is clear.

Boundless, its end is without measure.

Huizong annotated:
*"The myriad complexities of worldly affairs,*
*entangled and inexhaustible,*
*without beginning or end—*
*this is what is meant by ‘good and evil not yet settled.’*
*Only the enlightened know they merge as one."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The vastness of the six directions,*
*the multitude of things,*
*endless threads of turmoil,*
*daily pressing forward,*
*entangled and chaotic,*
*too vast to respond to—*
*this is the inexhaustible complexity of worldly affairs.*

*Circulating like a turning wheel,*
*repeating like a saw’s pull,*
*clustered and distant, without trace,*
*this is what is meant by ‘inexhaustible and unfathomable.’*

*‘This is right,’ ‘That is wrong’—*
*each a distinct judgment—*
*this is what is meant by ‘good and evil not yet settled.’*

*Common folk take good as what is approved,*
*evil as what is rejected—*
*thus what they reject is not what they approve,*
*though there are judgments of approval and rejection,*
*all originate from the realm of ‘this’ and ‘that.’*
*How could they know of the vast, mysterious, and unified Dao?*

Only the enlightened release their intellect,
turning their light to illuminate Heaven—
then what things call ‘that,’
does it truly have a fixed nature?
Without fixed nature, then all is ‘that.’

What things call ‘this,’
does it truly have a fixed nature?
Without fixed nature, then all is ‘this.’

If things have no ‘this’ or ‘that,’
then one knows they merge as one—
beauty and ugliness, good and evil,
would be simplified yet cannot be—
why then distinguish them so?

The common crowd rejoices,
as if feasting on the grand sacrifice,
as if ascending the spring platform.

Huizong annotated:
*"All things flourish with yang, congeal with yin.*
*Rejoicing is the outward manifestation of flourishing.*
*The common crowd loses the stillness of nature,*
*pursuing external affairs—*
*like delighting in rich flavors to nourish body and mouth,*
*like gazing upon grandeur to entertain heart and will.*
*Those lost in pleasure drift ever farther from the Dao."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"Yin and yang are the great movements of qi."*

The essence of things lies in their qi—
when yang flourishes, it is vibrant and harmonious,
for yang melts and completes itself;
when yin congeals, it is still and tranquil,
for yin halts and settles.

Sometimes vibrant, sometimes congealed—
it depends on the season and the thing.
Thus, the flourishing is but the outward display of vitality.

The common crowd loses the stillness of nature,
transforming with things,
pursuing external affairs while neglecting inner observation.

They delight in rich flavors to nourish body and mouth,
yet never know the subtlety of simplicity—
not merely feasting on the grand sacrifice.
They gaze upon grandeur to entertain heart and will,
yet never perceive the boundless void—
not merely ascending the spring platform.

Those lost in pleasure are burdened by things,
thus drifting ever farther from the Dao.

If one attains the wondrous observation of singular nature,
then all dharmas are complete—
movement and stillness merge,
true joy is preserved whole,
and what distance remains from the Dao?

I alone fear the unmanifested—
like an infant before its first stirrings.

Huizong annotated:
*"The Classic says: Return to the infant state.*
*Zhuangzi says: If not yet in infancy, then who begins?*
*The infant’s thoughts are yet unformed,
indifference to near and far is equal,
serene and still—
harmony accumulates within,
while brilliance does not yet manifest externally,
thus like an infant before its first stirrings."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"When a person is born, their form and essence are densely transforming.
In infancy, their nature is empty and without knowing—
as the Classic says: *‘Constant virtue does not depart,’*
and then: *‘Return to the infant state.’*
When a child reaches toddlerhood, affection already stirs—
as Zhuangzi says: *‘Born five months, able to speak—
if not yet in infancy, then who begins?’*
Only in infancy, without knowing,
does one reside without purpose,
walk without destination,
thoughts unformed and nothing to ponder,
indifference to near and far, nothing to choose.
Serene and still—
qi is harmonious yet not violent,
nature pure yet undispersed.
Harmony accumulates within while brilliance does not manifest externally—
thus, following nature naturally,
without artificial adornment,
like an infant before its first stirrings.
For *‘fear’* means the heart receives nothing.
When the heart receives nothing,
it is serene and empty of all things,
embracing the One and guarding the True—
what choice between this and the infant before its first stirrings?
The Master Lao established his teaching in the world,
desiring the people to return to the infant state—
thus, in *‘Cultivating qi and attaining softness,’* he says: *‘Can one be like an infant?’*
And in *‘The depth of virtue,’* he says: *‘Compared to the uncarved block.’*
Though his words differ,
his intent is to refine nature and restore virtue—
when virtue reaches its original state, it is One.

*Buying and selling, returning to the origin.*
Huizong annotated:
*"The *Yijing* says: *‘At the proper time, ride the six dragons to govern heaven.’*
*Buying and selling*—
following the season and principle without leaning to one side,
thus appearing to have no destination."

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The transformations of all things are chaotic and uneven.
Only by adapting to change, without attachment,
can one speak of *buying and selling.*
The *Yijing* says: *‘At the proper time, ride the six dragons to govern heaven.’*
The dragon rides the time—
speaking of the *Yi* principle transforming through timely adaptation.
Only by adapting to the time,
following its inherent principle and riding it,
why need one drive?
Thus, *buying and selling* means holding fast without constraint,
following principle without resistance,
naturally aligning with things yet not leaning to one side—
thus appearing to have no destination.
This aligns with *‘All things are threads of the One, none sufficient to return to.’*

The common crowd all have excess.
Huizong annotated:
*"Someone asked: ‘What is the common crowd?’
Answered: ‘Those born to wealth and nobility.’
Those who feast on life and covet gain—
their extravagant hearts prevail,
while frugality fades—
thus, they all have excess.
In the Dao, this is called *‘excess food, superfluous actions.’*"

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The Sage values the Dao above wealth,
while the common crowd values wealth above the Dao.
The Sage asks: *‘Is one practicing the Dao?’*
The common crowd replies: *‘Is one amassing riches?’*
Yang Xiong sought to remedy the times,
thus posing the question: *‘What is the common crowd?’*
and answering: *‘Those born to wealth and nobility.’*
The wealth of Jin and Chu was wealth for gain—
who compares to preserving what is most fitting?
The nobility of Zhao Meng was nobility of rank—
who compares to preserving true nobility?
Only the common crowd sees things yet not the Dao,
demands life to indulge their passions,
covets gain to exhaust their desires—
their extravagant hearts prevail, and the wasteful are many,
while frugality fades, and those who restrain themselves are few—
thus, they all have excess,
yet never know that in the Dao it is called *‘excess food, superfluous actions.’*
For where the Dao resides,
depth is its root,
and restraint its measure.
Extravagant appearance and licentious will—
in eating, it is excess;
in action, it is superfluous—
this is called *‘theft of splendor,’*
not the Dao indeed."

I alone am as if abandoned.
Huizong annotated:
*"Function covers the world,
yet seems not of oneself."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The Sage, through the Dao, lends to the world,
nurtures all things yet does not claim righteousness,
benefits countless ages yet does not claim benevolence,
covers heaven and earth, carves all forms yet does not claim skill—
never has he acknowledged his deeds as his own.
*Zhuangzi’s Inner Chapters* discuss the governance of the enlightened king:
*‘Function covers the world, yet seems not of oneself,’*
saying he *‘plays in the void.’*
For the *‘void’* is the mysterious operation of the Dao—
the Sage, with ultimate emptiness, responds to all things,
thus accomplishing the emperor’s function—
this is truly incidental.
How could he claim it as his own and possess it?
I, a foolish man, am pure—
*pure and simple.*
Huizong annotated:
*"Confucius said: *‘When I spoke with Ran You, all day he did not contradict me—
as if he were simple.’*
*Pure and simple*—
heavenly mechanism does not unfold,
yet silently harmonizes with the Dao—
this is called great wisdom."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The virtuous person’s abundant virtue
appears as simplicity—
is this not Ran You?
Observe his explanation of *‘heart’s fasting’* and the marvel of *‘sitting-forgottenness’*—
the Sage, recognizing his profound insight,
said: *‘When I spoke with Ran You, all day he did not contradict me—
as if he were simple,’*
meaning *‘his appearance was simple.’*"*

The true nature of the single essence,
serene and ever-present,
quiet and effortless yet without the stir of heaven’s mechanism,
empty and tranquil, silently harmonizing with the Dao—
then pure whiteness is fully within,
and morning clarity reveals its singularity.
This is truly great wisdom.

The *Zhuzi* says:
*"He who lacks the dim and hidden intent
has no radiant clarity;
he who lacks the sluggish and dull affairs
has no resplendent achievement."*
Is this what is meant?

Yet I, this foolish man’s heart—
*pure and simple*—
am I truly foolish?
No—it is only that lesser wisdom is discarded
while great wisdom shines forth.

The common man is radiant,
while I alone seem dim;
the common man is keen,
while I alone am muddled.

Huizong annotated:
*"If one conforms to the common flow,
then radiance is taken for clarity—
yet its clarity is small.
Keenness is taken for wisdom—
yet its wisdom is hollow.
To abandon things and people,
standing apart from the world’s habits,
then one appears as if lost yet exists,
as if dull yet sharp—
how could the vulgar world perceive this?"*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"To preserve light without revealing it
is the utmost clarity.
To act without contrivance
is the true wisdom.
The emotions of the common masses,
obscured by shallowness,
adorn themselves with vulgarity and align with it—
thus they take radiance for clarity,
yet their clarity is small,
not the ultimate clarity;
they take keenness for wisdom,
yet their wisdom is hollow,
not the true wisdom.

Those who embody the Dao differ thus:
subtle, mysterious, and profound—
unfathomable.
Abandoning things, they bear no burden;
separating from people, they are not enticed.
Loftily detached from the vulgar,
they awaken as if lost yet exist—
as in *‘serene, as if perhaps existing’*—
they appear dull yet are sharp—
as in *‘the more dull, the more sharp.’*
Their emergence and disappearance,
their uses hidden—
deeply subtle and obscure,
impossible to discern.
How could the vulgar world perceive this?

Mencius said:
*The deeds of the virtuous person
the common people cannot recognize.*

*Damp and vast, like the sea.*

Huizong annotated:
*"Deep and still, nature settled—
the complete body of the Dao."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"Deep in dwelling, pure in clarity—
deep and still, nature settled,
inner preservation, outer undisturbed—
*damp and vast, like the sea*—
this is the complete body of the Dao.
Though the Dao’s essence is unseen,
observe the greatness of the sea’s waters—
neither shifting with time nor advancing with measure,
the ancient principle truly resembles this.

*Swift and unrestrained, as if boundless.*

Huizong annotated:
*"Changing yet not fixed—
the Dao’s practical application."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"Moving yet ever emerging,
its momentum inexhaustible—
changing yet not fixed,
not stagnating in things—
*swift and unrestrained, as if boundless*—
this is the Dao’s practical application.
Though the Dao’s use is unseen,
observe the gusting wind—
it stirs all things yet shows no agitation,
howls through all openings yet measures no sweeping—
its wondrous, formless use truly resembles this.

All people have their purposes,
while I alone am stubborn and crude.

Huizong annotated:
*"Osmanthus is edible, so it is cut down.
Lacquer is useful, so it is stripped.
All know the use of utility,
yet none know the use of non-utility.
All people have their purposes—
this is called the use of utility.
I alone am stubborn and crude—
this is called the use of non-utility.
*The Classic* says:
*The heart not conforming to the patterns of virtue and righteousness is crude.*
Anciently, *‘refined’* was called beautiful,
*‘uncultivated’* was called crude.
Crude means not adorned with wisdom,
uncultivated means not seen as beautiful—
the divine person thus is without talent."

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The way of governing the world
considers non-utility as the utmost use.
Osmanthus is edible, so it is cut down.
Lacquer is useful, so it is stripped—
these are uses of utility,
the breath of the vulgar.
All know how to flaunt their wisdom,
boast their abilities—
this is the use of utility,
yet they do not know how to fragment their virtue—
this is the use of non-utility.
All people have their purposes—
this is the use of utility,
because of their vulgarity.
I alone am stubborn and crude—
this is the use of non-utility,
because of my lack of talent.
*Crude* is the same as *‘dim crude’*—
*crude* means without knowledge.
*Uncultivated* is the same as *‘utterly crude’*—
*uncultivated* means without refinement.
The divine person thus is without talent,
yet this lack of talent is what makes him the greatest talent—
thus the use of non-utility is clearly use.

Zhuangzi in *The Worldly Realm*
first spoke of the crooked plowshaft,
then of the great tree of Shangqiu,
and finally of osmanthus cut because it is edible,
lacquer stripped because it is useful—
clearly showing how the use of non-utility differs from the use of utility.

Yet to wander *The Worldly Realm*
and share in the people’s joys and sorrows—
how could one not know this?

I alone differ from others,
yet seek nourishment from my mother.

Huizong annotated:
*"An infant longs for the colt’s following—
only the Dao’s seeking remains.
The Dao generates, nurtures, grows, and rears—
all things draw from it.
It has the intent of a mother.
Only the Dao’s seeking is this,
so as to differ from those who lose their nature in vulgarity."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"The Dao acts through all things,
lending and completing,
covering and nurturing without limit—
it can be the mother of the world.
All that has life and form—
how could any depart from the Dao?
Yang Xiong’s *Asking About the Dao* says:
*‘An infant longs for the colt’s following,’*
to show that all things seek the Dao’s origin in nature,
not by coercion.
The Dao, from emptiness and stillness,
transforms into the myriad things,
generates them to fulfill their nature,
nurtures them to perfect their growth,
lengthens them to completion,
rears them to fullness—
all things go to draw from it without depletion,
how different from the mother’s embrace?"*

The myriad things arise from the Dao, thus the Dao is the mother and the things are her children. The *Classic* states:
*"There is the mother of all named things."*
And again:
*"The world has its beginning, which becomes the mother of the world."*
Thus, the Dao’s maternal intent is clearly seen.

People of the world not only fail to grasp their mother but cannot even preserve her. They abandon the true for the false, and the Dao grows ever more distant. Hence, the ancients spoke of *"seeking the sea with a spear"* as their only recourse.

But those who seek only the Dao—
how different are they from those who lose their nature in vulgarity?

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue-Power of the Sage’s Container**
The virtue-power of the Sage’s container follows only the Dao.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao. When things arise through it, that is called virtue-power."*
The Dao is ever nameless—how could it be described?
Thus, its virtue-power is made divine.

Virtue-power has a defined form, which all may share,
and through this, the Dao is revealed.
When nature is refined and returns to virtue-power,
virtue-power reaches back to its origin—
thus, it follows only the Dao.

*The Cushui Explanation* says:
*"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang.
Yin and yang together constitute the Dao.
To generate without possession is called the Mysterious Virtue-Power.
When things arise through it, that is called virtue-power.
The Dao is hidden and nameless, without form to be seen—
thus, it cannot be described in words.
Virtue-power has a fixed form, and all that is born is complete within it,
so it is what all may share.

Yet virtue-power encompasses the Dao,
and the Dao is what makes virtue-power manifest.
Thus, the nameless Dao divinizes its virtue-power;
the Dao disperses into virtue-power,
and virtue-power illuminates the Dao’s obscurity.
Thus, when virtue-power is refined and returns to its origin,
it aligns with the initial state—
virtue-power, returning to the nameless origin,
becomes one with the Dao.
This is why it follows only the Dao.

The Dao, as a thing, is but vague and indistinct.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"The Dao’s essence is ultimate emptiness, yet its function is wondrous manifestation—
thus it is a thing, though all things are the Dao.
‘Vague’ refers to the visible forms that may be glimpsed.
‘Indistinct’ refers to the numbers that may be traced.
Yet what is called ‘having’ is but doubt of the ‘none’—
hence, the Dao as a thing."*

*The Cushui Explanation* says:
*"The Dao has essence and function.
Speaking of its essence, it has never been a thing—
this is called ultimate emptiness.
Speaking of its function, it responds without exhaustion—
this is called wondrous manifestation.
Ultimate emptiness reveals itself as wondrous manifestation—
this is why it is a thing.
Wondrous manifestation arises from ultimate emptiness,
so all things are the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is seen in its vagueness and indistinctness.
‘Vague’ has no fixed form—only the mind can conceive it—
thus, it is a visible form that may be glimpsed.
‘Indistinct’ marks the beginning of numbers—
numbers arise from it—
thus, it is a sequence that may be traced.
Vague and indistinct—
sometimes it seems to have form, sometimes not—
this is called ‘having’ while doubting ‘none.’
The Dao as a thing—
is this not its subtle presence?

Vague and indistinct,
yet within them are forms.
Indistinct and vague,
yet within them are things.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"What is seen is called form; what takes shape is called thing.
Within the indistinct and vague, forms and things are complete—
like the Great Void transforming into wind and thunder,
like the Great Block becoming water and fire,
to bring about transformation and move the numinous—
this is the Dao’s marvel."*

*The Cushui Explanation* says:
*"Things arise, and then forms appear—
thus, form is the precursor to auspiciousness, hence ‘seen’ is called form.
The four seasons disperse their essence into things—
thus, things are confined to having shape, hence ‘shape’ is called thing.
Things and forms emerge from the indistinct and vague—
like wind sweeping through the mountains, thunder shaking the heavens,
changing the Great Void;
like water flowing downward, fire blazing upward,
transforming the Great Block.
Thus, they bring about transformation—
insects enter and exit plants, life and death all depend on this to complete.
Thus, they move the numinous—
from shaped beings to the formless, from sentient to the unsentient,
all depend on this to act.
The Dao’s marvel is seen in this.

Mysterious and dark,
yet within them is essence.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"‘Mysterious’ is the utmost depth of seclusion.
‘Dark’ is the hidden source of brightness.
Within the mysterious and dark lies the origin of ultimate yin,
where Heaven’s One manifests, and essence truly arises."*

*The Cushui Explanation* says:
*"Seclusion in a cave is hard to see—thus, ‘mysterious’ is the utmost depth of seclusion.
The sun hides for six days—thus, ‘dark’ is the hidden source of brightness.
Above the Great Brightness lies the origin of ultimate yang,
so within the mysterious and dark lies the origin of ultimate yin.
The origin of ultimate yin, in the five phases, is north.
Heaven’s One generates water in the north, which in humans is essence.
Thus, within the mysterious and dark lies the source of essence.

Its essence is most true,
and within it lies sincerity.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"Essence is the utmost of Heaven’s virtue.
It is upright and without deceit—hence, ‘most true.’
It is singular and unchanging—hence, ‘sincerity.’
Thus, it endures without interruption, and its name does not fade."*

*The Cushui Explanation* says:
*"Essence is what the One generates, and Heaven attains the One to become pure—
thus, essence is the utmost of Heaven’s virtue.
The *Book of Changes* speaks of the seven virtues of *Qian*, and ‘pure’ is one—
thus, essence is Heaven’s virtue, is it not clear?
Attaining the One to be born, the unformed has its portion—
thus, it is singular and unchanging—is this not sincerity?
If so, then all things from beginning to end are thus,
and the essence of the One pervades without interruption—
this is why its name does not fade.

To observe the transformations of the myriad beginnings—
how do I know the myriad beginnings are thus?
Because of this.

*The Huizong Commentary* says:
*"The transformations of the myriad beginnings are ever-passing without halt.
The utmost essence is ever-present without fading.
The Sage values essence, thus able to observe the transformations of the myriad beginnings
and know their reason."*

To remain without thought, yet be serene in stillness,
To act without doing, yet move without motion—
Yet when stirred by response, the Way of all things unfolds,
Then thought arises as the beginning of action,
And the traces of deeds are left behind.
Who but the utmost essence of the world
Could partake in this?

*The Commentary on the Meaning* says:
Divine marvels transform into stench and decay,
Stench and decay transform into divine marvels—
The transformations of the myriad beginnings
Are thus ever-passing without halt.
The One’s essence, harmonized with Heaven’s order,
Is why the utmost truth remains ever-present without fading.
The Sage values essence,
And thus attains the Dao from ancient times to today—
Its name never fading.

In the ebb and flow of waxing and waning,
Ending only to begin anew,
He speaks of the grand principle’s method,
Discourses on the nature of all things—
Thus, he observes the transformations of the myriad beginnings,
Knowing their reason without knowing why.

The Sage, through this, purifies the heart,
Ever without thought, serene in stillness,
Retreating into hidden depths,
Ever without doing, unmoved—
Yet when stirred, the Way of all things unfolds.

Once without thought, yet thought must arise;
Once without doing, yet action must follow.
Thought emerges from non-thought,
Action from non-action—
Thus, grand achievements and abundant deeds leave their mark.
Who but the utmost essence of the world
Could accomplish this?

This chapter first speaks of the virtue of the utmost essence,
And finally speaks of knowing the transformations of the myriad beginnings—
For this very reason.

*[Note: "曲则全" (Quzequan) is a chapter title, meaning "Flexibility Brings Wholeness."*]

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Yielding to things like a serpent’s wave, it preserves its form and life without loss."*

Zhuangzi says: *"The outwardly bent conforms to others as a disciple."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Dulling its radiance yet not obscuring, blending with dust yet not differing—greatly harmonizing with things, it twists with them, fittingly like bending. Then its body leads while the body remains, and it withdraws its body while the body survives. Such bending is how it preserves its form and life without loss."*

Zhuangzi takes *"yielding to things like a serpent’s wave"* as the essential principle of vitality, and says: *"The outwardly bent conforms to others as a disciple."* Only by bending outwardly does one not offend others’ sentiments—is this not *flexibility brings wholeness*?

**Gunzezhi (Crookedness Brings Straightness):**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"When abandoned, one does not grieve; when confined, one does not lament—thus inwardly straight without losing its uprightness."*

The *Yi* says: *"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"When abandoned and left to perish, one should grieve yet does not; when confined and made destitute, one should lament yet does not. This seems like crookedness. Yet straightness without rigidity is how it preserves its straightness. Those who take accusation for straightness only harm their integrity. Such crookedness is what is called *straightening its uprightness*."*

The *Yi* says: *"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth."* Indeed, bending is how it seeks its truth—is this not *crookedness brings straightness*?

**Woxiying (Hollow Brings Fullness):**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Without hoarding, there is abundance."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Hide mountains in marshes, boats in ravines, and they vanish without trace. Hide grain in困, water in vessels, and they are easily exhausted. Only by possessing what is within—able to move without accumulation—can one then use it, and it will overflow with abundance. This is what Zhuangzi means by *without hoarding, there is abundance*."*

Illustrated by the nature of myriad things, *hollow brings fullness*—this is clear.

**Biezixin (Exhaustion Brings Renewal):**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"If winter’s enclosure is not firm, spring’s growth will not flourish."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Only by returning to root can one hope for its teeming. With the season of killing, one can hope for its flourishing. Only by storing in winter—firmly—can spring’s abundance necessarily thrive."* Illustrated by the cycles of the four seasons, *exhaustion brings renewal*—this is clear.

**Shaozeduo (Fewness Brings Gain, Multitude Brings Confusion):**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Dao’s essence is not in complexity; many words and sights are not as good as simplicity. If one takes branches for the essence, one will never comprehend—this is great confusion."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"The Dao is one and only. Thus its essence is not complex. Many words must be held with simplicity; many sights must be held with clarity. Only by having many words and sights yet returning to simplicity can one gain the Dao. If the learned are confined to branches as their essence, their speech will be exhausted, and they cannot avoid entanglement. Those in great confusion will never comprehend—are these not such people?"*

Zhuangzi says: *"The Dao does not desire mixture."* This is the same meaning.

Thus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Its manifestation is not dual, so its creation of things is boundless. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. The Sage embraces Oneness to guard it, unshaken in its essence, so when speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Only the utmost sincerity of the world can exhaust the nature of things. Exhausting the nature of things, one can assist Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation, participating with them. Its manifestation is not dual—this is sincerity. Its creation of things is boundless—this is assisting Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation. Only Oneness can preserve essence; only essence can gather spirit. What is this Oneness? It is sincerity itself. The penetration of Oneness’s essence ensures spirit’s preservation—essence precedes, and spirit follows. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. Embracing Oneness alone, the Sage exhausts this."*

If Oneness remains unchanging, guarding it without loss, then the utmost truth’s essence is internally preserved and not scattered. Thus, spirit and essence flow in all directions—upward reaching, downward curling—transforming and nurturing myriad things, beyond representation. When compelled to speak, speech forms patterns and all under Heaven follow. When compelled to act, action forms virtue and all under Heaven emulate it.

As the *Records* say: *"When speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven—this is the model for all under Heaven."*

**Not seeing oneself, hence clarity:**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Not being obscured by one’s own views, it illuminates without bounds, hence clarity."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"With four eyes and four ears, broadening vision and hearing without obstruction, it can illuminate the farthest reaches and know people’s true sentiments. Not being obscured by one’s own views is how it can illuminate without bounds and be clear."*

**Not insisting on oneself, hence brilliance:**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct, then great deeds and fame shine, and all under Heaven submit—hence brilliance."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Consulting the many, abandoning self to follow others, not using oneself yet praising what is correct—thus achieving resplendent deeds and universal peace. Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct is how one achieves great deeds and fame, making all under Heaven submit and thus shining."*

**Not praising oneself, hence merit:**
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The *Book of Documents* says: *You alone do not boast; none under Heaven will contend with you for merit.*"*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"The Classics say: *Those who praise themselves have no merit.* The *Book of Documents* says: *Having goodness, yet losing it.* Able not to boast of merit, so others do not contend, and its merit does not vanish."*

Yu’s command to Yu the Great said: *"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for merit."* Could this be what is meant?

Not self-aggrandizing, hence enduring.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Classics say: You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for ability."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"The Classics say: Those who boast do not endure. The Classics say: Boast of one’s abilities, and one loses one’s merit. Only by not boasting of one’s abilities does one ensure others do not contend, and the common people align with one’s merit."* Yu’s command to Yu the Great said: *"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for ability."* Could this be what is meant?

He who does not contend, hence none can contend with him.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"All take precedence, yet he alone remains last, saying, ‘I receive the filth of the world.’ If such, he always dwells in the realm of non-contention—who can contend with him?"*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"The multitude values strength over virtue and seeks to surpass others, hence all take precedence. The Sage does not dare to lead the world but follows the Way in humility, thus he alone remains last. Remaining last, he knows white yet embraces black, knows honor yet embraces disgrace—honor and disgrace are seen equally, and he does not burden his heart with self-indulgence. This is called receiving the filth of the world. If so, he presents humility and weakness as his exterior, yet his interior is vast and unspoiled, preserving all things. Dwelling in non-contention, he accumulates countless small victories into great ones. Always in non-contention, who can contend with him? The ancients spoke of ‘yielding to preserve wholeness’—was this not truth? Truly whole, and thus it returns.*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Sage’s actions flow like water, interacting with all yet never diminishing his wholeness. His responses align like a plumb line, following principle yet never losing their straightness. Knowing that emptiness brings fullness, he bears no burden of excess. Knowing that decay brings renewal, he leaves no trace of arrogance. Like nature acting of itself, unaware of its doing, he merely attains yielding. Thus, whole and returning, he can preserve his life, fulfill his years, yet remain unaware of their end. This is called the person of perfect virtue—was this not truth?"*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"Water conforms to the vessel’s shape, round or square—none can contend with it. The Sage’s actions are thus, enabling him to yield to all while preserving his form and life, as said: ‘His actions flow like water, interacting with all, yet never diminishing his wholeness.’ The plumb line is gathered and tied, its nature ever straight. The Sage’s responses are thus, enabling him to follow things’ crookedness while his straightness remains within, as said: ‘His responses align like a plumb line, following principle, yet never losing their straightness.’ Knowing that emptiness brings fullness, he thus attains great fullness like a void, humbly tending himself—what burden of excess? Knowing that decay brings renewal, he harmonizes his brilliance and waits in obscurity, never boasting—what trace of arrogance? All this is not a forced understanding of yielding and crookedness but a natural alignment, as if by instinct, emptying himself to respond, not clashing with things, merely attaining yielding. Thus, whole and returning, he can preserve his life without fear of peril, fulfill his years without fear of early death, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, enduring yet unaware of his end. Such is the person of perfect virtue—was this not truth? Truly whole, and thus it returns.*

**Chapter Twenty-Three: *Hishen Ziran* (Rare Speech, Natural)**
Rare Speech, Natural.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Rare—standing alone above all things, not opposing them, as the *Liezi* speaks of ‘doubtful solitude.’ Discarding knowledge and artifice, following Heaven’s principle, and not laboring externally, hence ‘natural.’"*

The *Cushui* commentary explains: *"The *Dao De Jing* says: *Listening yet not hearing is called rare.* The *De Jing* says: *Great sound is rare in voice.* Rare—broad yet with gaps, not heard by the ear—this is standing alone above all things, not opposing them. The *Liezi* speaks of ‘non-being as doubtful solitude’—non-being can generate life, non-being thus doubts its solitude, none can pair with it—could this be the meaning of ‘rare solitude’? Thus, he discards his sharpness and wisdom, abandons knowledge and artifice, harmonizes with Heaven’s virtue, and follows Heaven’s principle, standing firm in his place, not laboring externally—this is not what others can achieve, hence ‘natural.’ Therefore, gusts of wind do not last a morning, sudden rains do not last a day. Who does this? Heaven and Earth."*

---

Heaven and Earth themselves cannot endure long—how much less can they be matched by humans?

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
When Heaven and Earth create all things, the wind disperses them, allowing all forms to transform naturally, while rain nourishes them, letting all things grow spontaneously. Thus, they neither augment life nor spur completion, yet all things flourish between Heaven and Earth—this is how they endure long.

When gusts become relentless (*piāofēng*) and rains sudden (*zhòuyǔ*), yin and yang suffer discord and conflict. If one forces intervention, harm befalls the things—thus they cannot endure long.

**Exegesis:**
Heaven bestows, Earth generates—all things thrive together. Yet nothing disrupts life more swiftly than wind, nor nourishes it more deeply than water. Thus, the wind stirs and animates all forms, entrusting their transformation so that things may flourish freely; rain moistens and enriches all things, allowing them to grow luxuriant. It acts through natural course, not by augmenting life or aiding growth. Thus, life and transformation unfold in form and color between Heaven and Earth—this is the Way of enduring long.

But when wind grows fierce and swirling (*piāozhuǎn*), and rain gathers violently (*zhòujù*), this is not the harmony of yin and yang but the calamity of discord. To things, it brings augmentation and forced completion, not natural course—thus they suffer harm. How could such endure long?

Therefore, those who follow the Dao:
—Those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao;
—Those aligned with virtue are one with virtue;
—Those aligned with loss are one with loss.

Those aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;
Those aligned with virtue gain virtue;
Those aligned with loss gain loss.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Rarity (*xī*) means no external striving—beyond sound’s silence, awakening solely through innate awareness, merging with the Dao yet not entangled with things. How could virtue be named, or loss be burdened?

Only those unaware of the natural transformation of solitude mistake the Dao as difficult to know, difficult to practice—as if climbing to Heaven, beyond reach. Thus they labor mind and body in pursuit of the Dao, clinging to one-sidedness or obscured by narrowness, and the Dao is rent for all under Heaven.

Those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,
Those aligned with virtue are one with virtue,
Those aligned with loss are one with loss—
yet if they do not attain their own attainment,
then their attainment is itself a kind of loss.

**Exegesis:**
To stand alone above all things, not laboring externally—this is rarity. Able to discard sharpness and wisdom, silently recognizing harmony in soundlessness, alone in hearing the true resonance—thus merging with the Dao, beyond pairing with things.

When the Dao reaches this, there is neither gain nor loss—what virtue can be named, what loss can be burdened? The ignorant cannot dawn upon solitude, thus they do not know the natural transformation of solitude.

The Dao is inherently easy to know, yet none under Heaven knows it—thus it is deemed difficult to know.
The Dao is inherently easy to practice, yet none under Heaven practices it—thus it is deemed difficult to practice.

Some seek the Dao in the distant heights, as if climbing to Heaven and unreachable, unaware that the lower one descends, the more it is attained—unconstrained by heights. Though their minds may fixate, straining their thoughts, or their skills may weary their bodies in pursuing the Dao—what could they attain?

To pursue it thus is to grasp one-sidedness in the Dao, to cling to narrowness in things—the Dao’s wholeness is thus fractured.

Mankind is born with inherent solitude, unchanging in nature, yet if they pursue the Dao, my so-called "standing alone above all things" is now subservient to the Dao. Though they attain virtue or loss in three degrees, it is not their own attainment—only converging in loss.

Faith is insufficient, thus there is doubt.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Faith means no deception. Deception arises from true and false—if one takes the Dao as true and things as false, then faith is insufficient, and doubt arises. The disciples of Hui Shi and Han Fei all strayed far from the Dao because of insufficient faith.

**Exegesis:**
The Classic says: *"The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—this is true trust."* Though all things differ, none are without substance. To regard the untrustworthy as trustworthy is true trust.

Only those who know the Dao does not contradict things, yet do not take the Dao as true knowledge, nor things as false—thus there is nowhere without trust.

But those with insufficient faith arise from delusion, taking the Dao as true and things as false, unaware of the whole, and thus generate distinctions. Hence, those with insufficient faith also have doubt.

Like Hui Shi’s love of paradoxes, Han Fei’s rigid legalism—unaware that true and false merge in unity, and those who separate them stray far from the Dao—all because of insufficient faith.

**End of *Dao Xuē Zhēn Jīng* Exegesis, Volume Five** #1: *"Then then"*—likely a scribal error.
**Volume Six of *Moral Virtue True Classic* Exegesis**
By the Imperial Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: "The Unsteady Cannot Stand"**

The unsteady cannot stand; the overreaching cannot move.
*Huizong*’s Annotation: To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease. How difficult!

If one follows *virtue/power* as their guide, then all who have sufficient grounding will arrive.
The Exegesis says: The unsteady leans but does not stand firm, yet still they cannot doubt that standing is possible. The overreaching strides but does not hasten, yet still they cannot doubt that they can move with ease. To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these are those who cannot rest in tranquility, cannot align with nature, and thus cannot cease. To defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease, how difficult!

Only those who *follow their nature* and find self-sufficiency, who take *virtue/power* as their guide, and do not force or distort things as false—only these will arrive where they have sufficient grounding. Like the childless *Master Shushan* and *Wang Dai*, who lacked feet yet reached everywhere.

Those who see only themselves are not enlightened; those who insist on their own correctness do not shine; those who boast of their own merits have no true accomplishment; those who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.
In the Dao, this is called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous action*.

*Huizong*’s Annotation: Self-perception leads to insufficient wisdom to encompass all things, hence lack of enlightenment. Insisting on one’s own correctness means *virtue/power* is insufficient to harmonize with the multitude, hence lack of brilliance. They possess merit, yet lose it; they boast of their abilities, yet lose their efficacy. Where the Dao resides, it takes *depth* as its root and *simplicity* as its measure. Excessive display and lustful ambition—how could these be the Dao?

Thus, in eating, it is called *excess*; in action, it is called *superfluous*. Both are external adornments, not intrinsic.
Some may detest them, hence the Daoist does not dwell there.

*Huizong*’s Annotation: Luxury beyond nature leads to excess, which is what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. Hence, the Daoist does not dwell there.

The Exegesis says: The Dao of heaven lacks excess and instead fosters humility; the Dao of earth transforms excess into humility; the Dao of humanity abhors excess and cherishes humility. If one indulges in excessive display and lustful ambition, they are luxuriating beyond nature and filling themselves with excess. They should be what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. The Sage does not so. They always present *gentleness, weakness, humility, and modesty* as their outward form. Those who do not know that fullness brings burden and excess strains nature, yet indulge in self-swelling, should be what the Daoist does not dwell in.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: "The Formless Mixture"**

There is a formless mixture that arises before heaven and earth.
*Huizong*’s Annotation: *Qi* and form are complete yet undifferentiated—this is *primordial chaos*. To merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. This is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Heaven and earth also depend on this before they arise, hence it is said to arise before heaven and earth. Yet it is not the ineffable mystery of non-arising, hence it is called *thing*.

The Exegesis says: *Great Beginning* is the origin of *qi*; *Great Purity* is the origin of form. Before these three are differentiated, they are called *primordial chaos*. In the initial state of *primordial chaos*, the *Great Uncarved* has not yet dispersed—this is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Thus, to merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. The *Yijing* has the *Great Polarity*, which gives rise to the *Two Principles*. The *Great Polarity* is the source from which the *Two Principles* emerge, hence heaven and earth depend on it to arise. To enter *non-arising*, then *qi* is undifferentiated and *primordial chaos* is merged in the ineffable profundity. To descend into *arising*, then the light and clear separate from the heavy and turbid, manifesting in forms. Arising—how could this be the ineffable profundity of non-arising? It is called *thing*, and this is its proper designation.

Silent and boundless,
*Huizong*’s Annotation: Silent and boundless means it does not engage in movement, nor does it interact with things. It is pure and complete in itself.

The Exegesis says: Silent and unmoving means the silent has never engaged in movement. *Great Emptiness* is boundless and vast, meaning the boundless has never interacted with things. Not engaging in movement, not interacting with things—then it has no sound, no scent, pure and complete in itself.

Independent yet unchanging,
*Huizong*’s Annotation: Great constancy sustains it, unyielding to transformation—this speaks to the Dao’s essence.

The Exegesis says: From its own root and foundation, ancient and unshaken, nothing can topple it, no change can displace it. This is called *great constancy sustaining it*. If so, then all transformations are boundless, yet the Dao remains ever the same. Is this not the Dao’s essence?

Circulating endlessly without exhaustion,
*Huizong*’s Annotation: It benefits all things in their arising and passing, moving ceaselessly—this speaks to the Dao’s function.

The Exegesis says: When things arise, it arises with them; when things pass, it passes with them. All people rely on it, and wherever it goes, it endures. This is called *benefiting all things in their arising and passing*. If so, then in every arising and passing, yet it is always inexhaustible. Is this not the Dao’s function?

It can be the mother of all under heaven.
*Huizong*’s Annotation: All things depend on it for their arising.

The Exegesis says: That which is born cannot give birth to itself—only that which does not itself arise can give birth to all things. Therefore, all things must rely upon the Dao to arise. The Classic says: *"All things depend upon it to arise, yet it does not decline."* It also says: *"The world has a beginning, and it is called the Mother of the world."* I do not know its name, so I call it *Dao*, and forcefully name it thus.

*Huizong’s Annotation:* Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Names arise from reality, and reality has its measure—thus, naming is but the flourishing. The Dao is ever nameless, so when we name it with the greatest term, it is in contrast to the lesser. Thus, it can be named.

The Dao’s subtlety is small and profound; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest.
*The Exegesis says:* Left Scholar says: Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Things arise with water—water gathers and flourishes, this is flourishing. That which can be gathered into clusters, dispersed into branches, this is measure. Flourishing is the preliminary appearance of measure, before it congeals into form. Measure is the completed flourishing, fixed within a solid body. When things are formed and their measure is set, their abundance or scarcity becomes apparent—this is where names arise. Thus, names arise from reality, and reality has its measure.

Naming and giving it a childlike designation—this is the meaning of naming, so naming is but flourishing. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the Dao generates heaven and earth, so the Dao is ever nameless. The subtlest of subtleties, the most vast of vastness—thus, the great is the contrast to the small. The nameless is the Dao’s subtlety; the Dao’s subtlety is small and profound, hence this. Therefore, naming it as great is the Dao’s centrality; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest, hence this. Thus, it can be named.

When manifest in the utmost transformation, it is great and interacts with all things. When returning to the utmost profundity, it is small and distinguishes itself from all things. Only in its interaction with all things can it be named as great—covering and nurturing all things, viewing them equally with benevolence, encompassing all without distinction. Only in its distinction from all things can it be named as small—action through stillness, creation through repose, returning to its Dao without departing from its nature.

When interacting with all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *"In speaking of the far, it is unconstrained."* When distinguishing itself from all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *"In speaking of the near, it is still and correct."* The Dao’s distance from its root is far—its departure runs without pause, responds without exhaustion. Far, it is unconstrained—is this not the time of its interaction with all things? The Dao’s return to its root is near—it returns to its root in stillness, stillness as returning to its command. Near, it is still and correct—is this not the time of its distinction from all things?

Thus, the Dao is great; heaven is great; earth is great; the Sage-King is great.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* The Dao covers and nurtures heaven and earth. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without omission. The Sage-King occupies the central position between heaven and earth, aligning with them—thus, he too is great.

*The Exegesis says:* The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not lofty; it lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not deep. As Liezi says: *"Beyond heaven and earth, there is no greater heaven and earth."* Thus, the Dao can cover and nurture heaven and earth. The light and pure gather above as heaven—when its expanse is boundless, stars and all things are without exception covered. The heavy and turbid settle below as earth—when its breadth and depth are vast, mountains and seas are without omission borne. The Sage-King embodies this, positioned within, harmonizing the Three Powers with mutual communication, distinguishing the Three Extremes with their own essences. Thus, he can emulate heaven and earth within himself. This is why the four great things within the realm are so.

Yet, though not inherently great, they are ranked as great—still not departing from form. From the Supreme One, divided into four—still not departing from measure. Though having form yet not obstructed by form, though having measure yet not constrained by measure—this is how it is great.

Within the realm, there are four great things, and the Sage-King occupies one of them.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Descending from the Dao, there are square forms—thus, it is called the realm. Stillness is sagely; action is kingly. One who unifies the Three Powers and harmonizes human conduct—this is the utmost.

---

Thus, he shares the same essence as the Dao, the same function as heaven and earth, yet is still called great. *Cushiyi* says: Before the Dao descends, it is unified in the boundless void with no division, hence the earlier reference to the "mixed and complete Dao." Once dispersed, it is confined within square forms and thus visible, hence the current mention of the "realm."

The square form does not depart from the original essence of the Heavenly Dao—this is why it is said to be still and sagely. When it manifests in the rise of the Sage-King, this is why it is said to be active and kingly. Only when one transitions from stillness to action, from sagely virtue to kingly power, can he harmonize the Three Powers and fulfill the ultimate extent of human conduct.

As for the Sage-King’s undertakings and achievements, one who surpasses others in this is the king. One who surpasses others in this is akin to heaven, for the king’s capacity to fulfill human conduct is the same as heaven’s. The *Sutra* states: "The king is heaven." Is this not the Dao’s utmost perfection?

Within the realm, the four great things are thus, and the Sage-King resides in one of them. Now, the Dao is hidden and nameless—only he who dwells with it can comprehend it. Since he shares the same essence as the Dao, and heaven and earth establish their positions, while the Sage-King perfects his abilities, they all share the same function. Thus, the Dao, heaven and earth, and the Sage-King all originate from the same source, unified and harmonized, fulfilling human conduct to become one with heaven, embodying heaven to become one with the Dao—there is no distinction to be observed.

Humans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens, the heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *ziran* [自然].
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Humans refer to the Sage-King. The heavens do not act yet all things transform; the earth does not grow yet all things nurture. The Sage-King acts without effort yet achieves the world’s prosperity—what he follows is the Dao’s *ziran* alone.

The Dao follows *ziran* because it responds to things. *Ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety, but when it emerges to respond to things, the Dao descends to follow it as well.
*Cushiyi* says: Earlier, it was said that the Dao is great, the heavens are great, the earth is great, and the Sage-King is also great. Here, it is said that humans follow the earth—thus, it is known that "humans" refers to the Sage-King.

The heavens act without effort, yet remain clear; they allow all things to flourish naturally, thus not "producing" yet all things transform—this is the divine essence of the heavens. The earth acts without effort, yet remains tranquil; it entrusts all forms to their own growth, thus not "lengthening" yet all things are nurtured—this is the richness of the earth. Above, the Sage-King must act without effort to govern the world; below, he must act with purpose for the world’s benefit. To govern without effort yet achieve the world’s prosperity—this is the greatness of the Sage-King. These three principles are all derived from following the Dao’s *ziran*.

Indeed, humans do not fail to follow the heavens, yet it is said they follow the earth; the earth does not fail to follow the Dao, yet it is said to follow the heavens. This is because when speaking of the Dao, there must be an order. Ultimately, all originate from *ziran*—thus, it concludes with "the Dao follows *ziran*."

Even if discussing things, *ziran* is above them; if not discussing things, *ziran* is below them. From *ziran* arises the other, and from *ziran* comes extinction—*ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety. Yet the Dao follows it, emerging to respond to things, and thus its following is a descent to lower realms.
Zhuangzi said: "To respond in accordance with *ziran*—this is the Dao."
Is this not what is meant?

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Light’s Root, Stillness as the Lord of Agitation**
The heavy serves as the root of the light, stillness as the lord of agitation. Thus, the virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* The heavy does not sway or be stolen away, yet remains steadfast—thus, it serves as the root of the light. The still does not move recklessly, yet maintains control—thus, it lords over agitation.

With stillness and heaviness to sustain oneself, few will lose their way. The virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden—thus, though he treads cautiously, he fears no mishap.

*Cushiyi* says: Yang Xiong said: "Take the four heavy things." Heavy means one does not grow light. The *Sutra* states: "Hold steadfast to stillness." Stillness means one does not falter. Only when one does not grow light can things not displace him, and his center remains unshaken—thus, he is not swayed or stolen away, yet remains steadfast. Only when one does not falter can he not rush forward recklessly, yet respond to all movements—thus, he is not moved recklessly, yet maintains control.

Heaviness with steadfastness is why it serves as the root of the light;
Stillness with control is why it lords over agitation.
To be able to guard oneself with stillness means all movements cannot displace;
To be able to sustain oneself with heaviness means external things cannot overwhelm.
Few will lose their way—this is indeed his nature.

All things in motion have burdens; thus, they are heavy and slow. Without burdens, they are light and swift.
Movement is swift when light, yet it must rely on burdens to sustain itself. Though he treads cautiously, he fears no midway困 [困], hence no mishap.

Though there are grand spectacles, he must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Grand spectacles belong to things; tranquil repose belongs to the self. Only when the self is at ease can one enjoy the things around him.

*Cushiyi* says: Zhuangzi said: "When colors are paired, the five hues are disordered, and intricate patterns scatter the pure and the yellow in dazzling confusion." This is why grand spectacles belong to things. Mencius said: "The four limbs are for ease and repose." This is why tranquil repose belongs to the self. King Wen of Zhou, in his leisure, first ascended to the shore—his body was at ease, and then the pleasures of the terrace and pond appeared in his spirit. Only when the body is at ease can one enjoy things—this is evident here. Thus, though there are grand spectacles, one must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.

How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots govern the world with a light heart?
*Huizong’s Annotation:* The world is a great thing. To have great things is to be solemn, as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.

*Cushiyi* says: To act without effort and commit few faults is easy; to act with purpose yet bear no burdens is difficult. Can one who governs the world easily undertake such deeds? Yu praised Yao, saying, "Only the Emperor finds it difficult," and Tang said of himself, "I tremble with fear and anxiety." All who act with purpose find it difficult because of the burden of not being without effort. Thus, to have great things, one must be solemn as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.

Lightness leads to losing one’s ministers, haste leads to losing one’s subjects.

*Huizong’s Annotation:* If one does not weigh actions solemnly, there will be no authority, hence one loses one’s ministers. If one does not lead but merely harmonizes, one transgresses proper distinctions, hence one loses one’s subjects.

*Cushiyi* says: A dignified bearing naturally commands respect—this is the way of things. Without such weight, there is no authority. The ruler holds supreme dignity while ministers are lowly; only the ruler’s dignity matters, so one must not act lightly.

The ruler initiates, the ministers follow—this is the natural order. If the ruler does not lead yet the ministers harmonize, they overstep their roles. The ruler must act first, so one must not be hasty.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Benevolent Conduct**
Benevolent conduct leaves no trace.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* What is preserved is the Dao, what is manifested is transformation—thus, no trace remains.
*Cushiyi* says: The Dao is formless and boundless, yet it abides in harmony. Thus, what is preserved is the Dao. Transformation arises through the shifting of forms and is subject to traces—thus, what is manifested is transformation. Those who dwell in the Dao preserve without seeking, while those who dwell in traces pass through without guarding their steps. Such conduct should leave no trace behind.

Benevolent words bear no flaws or reproach.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* In harmony with the Dao’s natural flow, unfolding without constraint—thus, no flaws or reproach remain.
Words and deeds are grand in scope: they begin with contemplation and end in transformation. Only the Sage can perfect words and deeds, achieving the marvel of transformation—thus, benevolent conduct leaves no trace to follow, and benevolent words bear no reproach to burden.

*Cushiyi* says: *Tianni* refers to the origin of nature and life. *Manyan* refers to boundless change. If one aligns with the origin of nature and life, and follows with boundless change, then words spoken may endure all day, and words spoken may exhaust the Dao. Such words should bear no reproach.

Moreover, considering the *Yijing*:*
The *xiang* are the most refined patterns of the world—gentlefolk emulate them in speech.
The *yao* are the most dynamic forces of the world—gentlefolk act in accordance with them.

Words and deeds rest with humanity, while transformation belongs to Heaven and Earth.
Words and deeds begin with contemplation and end in transformation—thus, words and deeds are the pivot and mechanism of the gentlefolk.

Only the Sage comprehends the essence of words, making them the foundation of conduct. With such words, one can respond to distant affairs as if at hand, and govern the movement of Heaven and Earth.

The marvel of transformation is complete within oneself. If one acts thus, then conduct leaves no trace—coming and going alone, following only the grand Dao. What trace could there be?

If one speaks thus, then words conform to the law, set forth with divine intent, bearing no stain. What reproach could burden?

Benevolent planning does not rely on calculations.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* To grasp unity is to master all things—what need for numbers? Thus, calculations are unnecessary, yet myriad changes unfold as if counted one by one.

*Cushiyi* says: To know unity is to know all things, for all things in the world arise from unity. To grasp unity is to complete all affairs. Once one has achieved unity, one transcends numbers. To transcend numbers yet generate them is even more wondrous—how much more so to not rely on numbers yet bring them forth? It is fitting that no calculations are needed, for myriad changes, though seemingly countless, unfold as if counted one by two.

Benevolent closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Sealing the path guards the Dao, retreat hides in profound mystery.

*Cushiyi* says: Closing the mouth and sealing the gate, one holds fast to the Dao’s essence—none can alter its truth. *Tunna* guards the Dao thus. Zhuangzi said: "Without seeing or hearing, embracing the Dao in stillness—this is near the mark." The small mound and deep roots, the hidden position and concealed boundaries, yet the world cannot perceive its traces. Retreat hides in profound mystery—Zhuangzi said: "Hidden in the measureless rhythms of the Dao—this is near the mark." If one abides thus, though no bolts or bars are used, who could open it? This is called benevolent closure.

Benevolent binding requires no cords or fetters yet cannot be undone.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* To depend on cords and fetters for binding is to diminish one’s nature. Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them—binding without cords, who could undo it?

*Cushiyi* says: The world has its constants—one’s true nature is the origin, born with life, steadfast and unyielding. Why depend on cords and fetters for binding? To depend on cords and fetters is to harm one’s true nature and scatter one’s purity—thus, it diminishes one’s nature. The benevolent binder does not act thus: they water others’ hearts with perfect harmony, needing no words. They align with the Dao’s essence, causing others’ intentions to dissolve without relying on force. This is Zhuangzi’s meaning: "Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them"—precisely this.

If so, then attachment and separation do not require glue or lacquer, and bonds do not require ropes or knots. Who could undo it?

Thus, the Sage always benevolently rescues people, so none are abandoned.
The Sage always benevolently rescues things, so none are abandoned.

*Huizong’s Annotation:* Benevolence is the continuation of the Dao. To abide in the Dao is to transcend named benevolence. Once benevolence is named, the Dao emerges and the world is transformed. The Sage embodies the Dao to benefit the world—thus, these five benevolences extend to people and things without abandoning any.

Yet the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, allowing them to flourish and for humanity to rejoice in their nature, is not a matter of intention. It is to return to their constant state, following the Dao’s natural flow.

The world has lost the Dao. All under Heaven have abandoned their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, and daily sink into the realm of suffering. Who but the Sage can save them?

*Cushiyi* says: The *Yijing* says: "One yin and one yang—the Dao. To continue it is benevolence." Thus, benevolence is the continuation of the Dao, returning to the origin of the Great Dao. Then, benevolence and evil are merely distinctions that cannot be fully separated—thus, there is no named benevolence.

When benevolence is sung of as a virtue to be celebrated, it is rooted in the Dao, and thus its goodness encompasses all under Heaven—this is how the name of benevolence is established.

From virtuous deeds to perfect harmony, the Sage’s five benevolences extend without abandoning any, for they embody the ability to embody the Dao and thereby save all under Heaven.

The Sage loves and rescues people, letting them rejoice in life, and benefits and rescues things, letting them fulfill their nature—what need is there for deliberate intent? Returning to the One without trace, following the Dao without deviation, conforming to their natural state, riding the rites without obstruction, and letting all things fulfill their roles while the people govern themselves—this is all.

Yet if not for such a person, the Dao cannot act in vain, nor can it flourish in the world. Thus, the people lose their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, becoming confined and chaotic, weary and burdened, daily sinking into the realm of suffering. Without one to nurture and guide them, how can they avoid corrupting their nature or straying from their virtue?

It is not the duty of those who teach and transform to bear the weight of the world with the Dao, to bring forth the Dao and benefit the world, so that the people and things may each find peace in their natural essence—who else could achieve the function of perfect benevolence and salvation?

This is called *clothing in brightness* (袭明).
**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Clothing* means to reveal without display.
Clothing in brightness shines yet does not dazzle.

**Explication:** The dragon, as a creature, can be seen and can hide. *Clothing* means to hide while not yet revealed. Because it hides, when its scales are within, *clothing* carries the meaning of revealing without display—akin to the *clothing* in *"inciting and clothing"* (惕袭) that does not follow sequentially.

Clothing in brightness removes the slippery doubt of dazzling and the scheming brilliance of form, for it does not flaunt its own light. The Sage’s way in the world is to be a boundless source of wisdom, yet outwardly appears dim—this is why it is so.

Thus, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous; the unvirtuous person is the resource of the virtuous.
**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Resource* speaks to its utility—only when there is unvirtue does one recognize the utility of virtue.

**Explication:** All paths of utility can be transformed into wealth or used as bribes, but *resource* refers to secondary utility. Thus, *resource* speaks to utility, showing that when virtue is evident, one must preserve it, and when unvirtue appears, one must reflect upon it. Only then, with the existence of the unvirtuous, does the function and utility of the virtuous become apparent—this is why the unvirtuous serve as the resource of the virtuous.

Confucius said: *"When three men walk together, there is surely one who can be my teacher. I select his good qualities and follow them; I select his bad qualities and change them."* This is the same meaning.

Yet the Sage does not prize his teacher nor cherish his resource.
**Huizong’s Annotation:** When all under Heaven know virtue as virtue, then unvirtue already exists. Virtue and unvirtue are both forgotten—there is no room for deliberate intent, so what is there to prize or cherish? This is how the Sage achieves great harmony with all things.

**Explication:** In discussing the nature of things, virtue and unvirtue are unified. From the perspective of ordinary people, there is virtue, with unvirtue as its opposite. From the Sage’s perspective, both virtue and unvirtue are embraced—his heart is empty, with no preference or rejection. What is there to prize in the teacher of the unvirtuous? What is there to cherish in the resource of the virtuous? They are indistinct, forgotten, and transformed in the Dao.

Knowing that the distinction between virtue and evil arises from delusion, why would one cling to fine distinctions and generate the heart of prizing or cherishing?

Great harmony with all things is seen in the Sage.
Even the wise are utterly confused—this is called *the essential mystery* (要妙).
**Huizong’s Annotation:** The essential mystery of the Dao lies in not perceiving the multitude of virtues, having no use for wisdom. The Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to inquire about. The meaning aligns here.

**Explication:** Virtue is a deviation from the Dao; wisdom arises from the Dao’s manifestation. The essential mystery of the Dao merges virtue and evil into unity, so one does not perceive the multitude of virtues to seek them with wisdom, nor does one have any use for wisdom. Difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure or recognize—this is not the realm of cleverness or daring. This is why they are utterly confused.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor was about to meet the Great Spirit (大魄) at Mount Jutzi (具茨之山), arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng (襄城之野), where the followers of Fangming and Huaji (方明滑稽之徒) led the Seven Sages astray, leaving them utterly lost, with no path to ask. The Great Spirit is a metaphor for the essential mystery of the Dao; the Seven Sages are a metaphor for those not free from using wisdom.

The Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to ask—this demonstrates that the essential mystery of the Dao cannot be known through wisdom. The writings of Zhuang Zhou complement those of Laozi, evident here.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**
Know the heroic, yet hold to the yielding—
Thus you become the valley of all under Heaven.
As the valley of all under Heaven,
Your constant virtue never departs,
Returning to the infant.
**Huizong’s Annotation:** The heroic is the strong overcoming things; the yielding is gentle and still. The Sage’s wisdom knows how to overcome things, yet he himself dwells in gentleness and stillness. All things come to him, drawing from him without depletion—thus he is the valley of all under Heaven.

The valley is low, and flowing water rushes toward it—
This is to hold without force, yet sustain with humility,
So that virtue and nature remain forever united—
This is called *constant virtue*, returning to the infant.
Qi is harmonious yet not violent;
Nature is pure yet undispersed—
This is the infant.
Mencius said: *"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant."*

**Explication:** The heroic is the yang, firm in body and riding upon things, thus able to overcome them with strength. The yielding is the yin, gentle in body and receiving things, thus only gentle and still.

The Sage’s wisdom can awe the world and move the heavens and earth—this is knowing how to overcome things, which is called *knowing the heroic*.

Though firm in strength, he must yet be hidden and abide in gentleness;
Though active in motion, he must yet be profound and abide in stillness—
Thus he is able to preserve the yielding.

Only by abiding in gentleness can he never be severed from things;
Only by abiding in stillness can he suffice to respond to all movement.
When he gives to others as he does to himself, his virtue overflows abundantly,
Never exhausted—
This is how he becomes the valley of all under Heaven.

Moreover, the earth does not fill the east and south,
So all rivers and floods return to it—
Thus the valley, being low, is rightly where flowing water rushes.

The Sage preserves the yielding with gentleness and stillness,
Receiving all things without refusal.

Though the heroic involves firmness and overcoming with strength,
And the yielding involves humility and overcoming with gentleness—
The Sage, when firm, remains submerged and hidden,
Thus he does not employ strength;
When yielding, he establishes his foundation,
Thus he sustains it with humility.

Not employing strength yet sustaining with humility—
This is truly knowing the heroic while preserving the yielding.

Virtue arises from nature, originally never separated—
If one leans solely toward the heroic, harmony is consumed;
If one leans solely toward the yielding, there is nothing to establish.
Only by knowing the heroic while possessing firmness,
And preserving the yielding while completing with gentleness—
Can one achieve the refinement of harmony,
Filling all that is natural,
And thus the Sage’s virtue is complete—
What difference is there between him and the infant?

For the infant’s qi is focused and his will is singular,
Thus he is harmonious yet not violent;
His desires and thoughts are not yet fully formed,
Thus he is pure yet undispersed—
Only when virtue and nature are forever united
Does he return to the infant.

As Mencius said: *"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant."*

Knowing the bright, guarding the dark—
This is the model for all under Heaven.

To be the model for all under Heaven,
His constant virtue never errs,
Returning to the Boundless.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Brightness symbolizes virtue manifesting;
Darkness symbolizes the Way returning.
The Sage reveals his luminous virtue,
Yet silently unites with the Way—
Without flaw, he is the standard for all under Heaven.

His joy is extended without exhaustion,
Thus he is the model for all under Heaven.

He is upright yet not arbitrary,
Trustworthy as the four seasons,
Never deviating—
Such as this, difficult to exhaust, without end,
Never reaching an extreme—
Thus it is said: *constant virtue never errs, returning to the Boundless.*

The *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:
*"Return to its having an extreme."*
Laozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:
*"Return to the Boundless."*

Extreme means *the central way*.
Having an extreme refers to virtue manifesting in deeds,
Where centrality is the utmost.
The Boundless refers to virtue returning to the Way,
Which cannot be attained.

**Explication:**
Brightness is the center of yin, corresponding to the west,
The place where all treasures are completed—
Thus it symbolizes virtue manifesting.
Darkness explores its origin, corresponding to the north,
The time when all things return to their root—
Thus it symbolizes the Way returning.

The Sage emits the radiance of Heaven,
Illuminating the lower lands—
Thus his revealed virtue is the singular nature—
This is knowing the bright.
Retreating and hiding in seclusion,
Not revealing his essence—
Thus his silent unity is rooted in the Way—
This is guarding the dark.

With virtue and the Way fully complete,
Without flaw,
He is the standard for all under Heaven—
His example is followed, and all under Heaven conforms.
Without thought, all submit;
His joy is extended in his time,
His abundant virtue is unforgettable,
Not exhausted by the ages—
Thus he is the model for all under Heaven.

Only by being the model for all under Heaven
Does his uprightness remain unchanging and unshifting,
His timing follow naturally and inevitably.

Upright yet never erring,
He never acts arbitrarily—
Not expecting as he does,
The four seasons’ virtue reaches this—
What deviation could there be?

Such as this, the origin of true essence aligns with Heaven’s order—
Who can fathom its end?
Who can exhaust its limits?

Truly, all transformations have no end—
This is why it is said: *constant virtue never errs.*

Although the *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:
*"Return to its having an extreme,"*
And Laozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:
*"Return to the Boundless,"*
Why is this so?

The *Grand Pivot* was composed by Ji Zi to elucidate the subtleties of the Way,
While the *Dao De Jing* was written by Laozi to reveal the Way’s brilliance.

To elucidate the Way is to take the central harmony as the foundation,
Thus it is said: *having an extreme.*
For virtue manifesting in deeds,
Centrality is the utmost.

To reveal the Way is to take the utmost clarity as the foundation,
Thus it is said: *the Boundless.*
For virtue returning to the Way,
It cannot be attained.

Extreme means *the central way*,
Like the ridgepole of a house, where all beams converge,
Like the celestial pole, where all stars gather.
Whether present or absent,
Each has its proper place.

Knowing the honored, guarding the humble—
This is the valley of all under Heaven.

To be the valley of all under Heaven,
His constant virtue is complete,
Returning to the Uncarved.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Beyond nature and life, there is nothing but things.
Common people regard gain as honored, loss as humble,
Abundance as honored, restraint as humble.
Only the Sage can view honor and humiliation equally,
Without preference or rejection.

Yet he does not aspire to extravagance,
But takes restraint as his measure—
This is emptiness alone,
Thus he is the valley of all under Heaven.

The valley is empty yet able to receive,
Responding without storing—
When virtue reaches this, it is complete and exhaustive,
Nothing more can be added—
Thus it is said: *constant virtue is complete.*

The Uncarved is the whole of the Way;
Returning to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Way.

The solitary and the orphaned do not fill the valley,
Yet kings and dukes consider themselves worthy—
Thus, embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven becomes guest.

**Explication:**
One nature, concentrated and still—
Pure emptiness alone.
Beyond the self, nothing is not false—
Thus all beyond nature’s division is things.

Yet common people rejoice as if startled when they gain,
And grieve as if startled when they lose—
This is regarding gain as honored, loss as humble.

Some indulge in slander through wealth and nobility,
Others perish in poverty and lowliness—
This is regarding abundance as honored, restraint as humble.

The Sage knows that when things come, they cannot be rejected,
so he does not regard gain as honored,
and when they depart, they cannot be stopped,
so he does not deem loss as humiliating.

Honor and shame are seen equally, with no inclination to take or discard—
dwelling within the Uncarved, yet not aspiring to the adorned.
Within, he preserves the undisturbed,
and regards restraint as his standard,
attaining the utmost emptiness of the world,
yet without a single particle of perturbation—
thus he becomes the world’s valley.

Indeed, the valley as a thing
is empty yet capable of receiving,
receives yet does not hoard,
is empty yet capable of responding,
responds yet is never exhausted.

In his own virtue/power,
its emptiness is thus—
so he can respond to the world’s myriad fullness.
Nothing more can be added—
thus it is said: *constant virtue is complete.*

Within emptiness and stillness,
there exists a formless unity—
the essence of the Dao/Way.

Wood as the Uncarved,
before it is shaped into vessels,
its substance remains whole.

The Dao’s whole essence lies here—
if one can return to the Uncarved,
then he understands the Great Origin and Great Root,
and thus fully embodies the Dao/Way.

Though the solitary and orphaned lack the world’s nourishment,
which common people detest,
while kings and dukes esteem their own nobility—
all recognize the Dao/Way’s root in what is honored.

Embracing the Uncarved, one attains the Dao/Way;
those who attain the Dao/Way receive abundant assistance—
thus the world becomes their guest.
Embracing the Uncarved, the world becomes their guest—
as the Classic says: *The Uncarved though small, none under Heaven can subdue it.*
If lords and kings can guard it,
all things will naturally become their guests.

The Uncarved, once shaped, becomes vessels.
**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
That which transcends form is called the Dao/Way;
that which is beneath form is called vessels.
There are forms and names to distinguish,
and divisions to guard—
the Dao/Way is whole,
Heaven and man merge as one;
vessels are shaped,
Heaven and man separate as two.

**Explication:**
That which surpasses the Great Ultimate is the Dao/Way,
so it is called that which transcends form.
That which remains within the square and round is vessels,
so it is called that which is beneath form.
The Dao/Way and vessels
have forms that can be named,
and divisions that can be guarded.
Speaking of the Dao/Way itself,
the Great Changes are yet undivided,
and formless unity exists—
thus it is whole,
Heaven and man merge as one.
Speaking of vessels,
the Great Uncarved has already been shaped,
hidden and revealed are divided—
thus they are shaped,
Heaven and man separate as two.

The Sage applies it,
and thus becomes the ruler.
**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The Dao’s wholeness, the Sage uses to govern himself.
The Dao’s shaping, the Sage uses to govern the world.

There are forms to be named,
and divisions to be guarded—
thus he assigns duties and leads subjects,
and the world is ordered.
This is called the ruler.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*Know the subtle and the manifest,*
*know the yielding and the firm.*
The expectations of ten thousand men,
share the same meaning.

**Explication:**
The Dao’s truth is used to govern oneself—
as it is said: *The Dao’s wholeness, the Sage uses to govern himself.*
The Dao’s practical applications are used to govern the world—
as it is said: *The Dao’s shaping, the Sage uses to govern the world.*

Only by shaping the Dao to govern the world,
does one who lifts and places have divisions and standards to guard;
its forms are visible,
and its names can be spoken.
With forms and names,
its ability can be employed,
and its materials can be entrusted.
With forms to be named,
and divisions to be guarded—
thus duties are assigned and subjects led,
and the world is ordered.

Zhuangzi’s discourse on the great Dao/Way’s sequence
says that when virtue/power is clear,
then divisions and standards follow,
and when divisions and standards are clear,
then forms and names follow—
continuing to *necessarily divide its names,*
*necessarily follow its names*—
this is called the utmost attainment of *Great Peace and order.*
The meaning aligns with this.

The Sage applies it,
and thus becomes the ruler—
this is evident here.

*The Classic of Changes* speaks of knowing the subtle and the manifest,
knowing the yielding and the firm—
its virtue/power is fully complete,
virtue and righteousness both attained,
sufficient to be the expectations of ten thousand men—
is this not the meaning of the ruler?

Thus, the great measures do not cut.
**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
Transforming and adapting,
lies in change—
carving myriad forms,
yet not for craftiness.

**Explication:**
Following form and altering it is called transformation.
Severing form abruptly is called change.
From transformation to change,
this is the Dao’s sequence.
The Sage knows the Dao of transformation and change,
and presages change—
he shapes things yet is not shaped by them,
as *The Classic of Changes* says: *Transforming and adapting, lies in change.*

Though he shapes things,
he does not distinguish them with rigid boundaries—
carving myriad forms,
yet not for craftiness—
this is called *square yet not cutting.*
It is not that the great measures cannot reach this point.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: *The Way of the World’s Mastery***
He who would take the world and act upon it,
I see him as one who cannot help but fail.
**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The world is a great thing.
Having great things,
one cannot be a thing—
being a thing yet not a thing,
thus one can shape things.
Understanding that the shaper of things is not a thing,
and having no desire to take the world,
one can entrust the world to others.

He who would take the world and act upon it,
uses wisdom and relies on strength—
far from attaining it.
Thus the Sage follows Dao/Way’s transformation,
not extolling wisdom and strength—
Qin failed through force,
perhaps this is what is meant.

**Explication:**
All that has appearance, sound, or color,
are things.
What is the distance between things and things?
Though the world is vast,
it can be called a great thing.

Yet without understanding the Dao/Way,
even with great things,
one cannot shape things.
Only when one is unified with the Dao/Way,
and not shaped by things,
can one govern all things,
command the myriad movements,
and shape the world’s things.

Indeed, life is sustained by movement,
none can escape being shaped—
there must be one who is not constrained by things,
yet can shape things.
The shaper of things is the Dao/Way.
If one understands that the Dao/Way is not a thing,
then the universe lies within his grasp,
and he can entrust the world to others—
capable of bearing the world’s responsibility.

「Zhuangzi speaks of the *great thing* (大物), which cannot be a *thing* (物). By *thinging* (物) it and thus concluding it, one may realize that the *thinger* (物物者) is not a *thing* (物). Is this Dao/Way merely for governing the world (治天下)? It is precisely this meaning.

Yet the world’s *great instruments* (大器) are not to be wielded—one cannot govern the world without understanding the Dao/Way. To seize the world and act upon it is to rely on *intelligence* (智) and *strength* (力). To rely on *intelligence* is to invite *constraint* (困), and to rely on *strength* is to invite *exhaustion* (殆). This is far from the Dao/Way.

Thus, the Sage *entrusts* (任) the Dao/Way to transform (化) and does not *exalt* (尚) *intelligence* or *strength*—for the Dao/Way transforms without being constrained by *things*, while *intelligence* and *strength* are themselves constrained by *things*.

Only by not being a *thing* can one *thing* all *things*—this is why the Sage *entrusts* the Dao/Way to transform and does not *exalt* *intelligence* or *strength*.

The *Qin* of *Ying* (嬴秦) merely *exalts* *intelligence* and *strength*—how could this suffice to govern the world? Therefore, the ancients said that *Qin* lost through its *forcefulness* (强). Yang Xiong called *Qin* a *wolf* (狼), and this too is because of this.

The world’s *divine instrument* (神器):
**Huizong’s Annotation (徽宗注):** *Bound by form and number* (制於形数), *constrained by limits* (囿於方体), and *confined within the dual span of heaven and earth* (域於覆载之两问), this is what is called an *instrument* (器).
*Established in the unfathomable* (立乎不测), *acting without fixed boundaries* (行乎无方), those who *wield* it fail, and those who *cling* to it lose. Hence, it is called the *divine instrument*.

**Explication (疏义):** If one calls it the *Six Unities* (六合), then it is *bound by form and number*. If one calls it the *Universe* (宇宙), then it is *constrained by limits*. Though it spans the *dual realms of heaven and earth* (覆载之两间), it is not the *heaven and earth* themselves—thus, though vast, it is still an *instrument*.

Yet to *establish* it in the unfathomable without seeing its *advancement* (进), or to *act* without fixed boundaries yet never *encountering limits* (封), to *wield* it without knowing *non-action* (无为), then one must fail. To *cling* to it without knowing to *follow the times* (趋时), then one must lose. Though it has not departed from being an *instrument*, its *instrumentality* (为器) is indeed divine. Yet it cannot be *wielded*.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** To govern all *things* and command the myriad movements, there must be one who is not an *instrument*—only then can the world be governed. Hence it is said: *"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world."*

**Explication:** *Things* have *form*, then they can be named; they have *division*, then they can be guarded—this is what is called an *instrument*. There must be one who is not an *instrument*, only then can they *operate* their *instruments*.

The one who is not an *instrument* is the one who is not constrained by *things*—only by not being constrained by *things* can myriad *things* though numerous, and movements though diverse, all remain within the bounds of *prevention and guidance* (防范). Though they do not *intend* to govern and command, they naturally govern all *things* and command the myriad movements.

All who understand that the *thinger* (物物者) is not a *thing* (物) can thus achieve *non-action* (无为) yet fulfill the world’s tasks (功). Therefore, though they do not *govern* the world, the world is naturally governed.

The *Classic* says: *"The Dao/Way is ever non-acting yet nothing it does not act upon. If rulers could guard this, all things would naturally transform."* Zhuangzi says: *"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world."*

Those who face south and rule the world, if they *cling to deeds* (事为) and their *traces* (迹), yet do not know to take *non-action* as constant, to *pursue the bounded* (有涯) while abandoning the *boundless* (元涯), then their *intelligence* will be constrained—how could they employ the world and transform all *things*?

Hence Zhuangzi says: *"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat."* Those who *wield* meet with *defeat*.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** One who can *wield* yet cannot *non-act* will have their *intelligence* constrained.

Zhuangzi says: *"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat."*

**Explication:** To *enter* and *distinguish* with *things* is to differ; to *unify* is to practice *non-action*. To *exit* and *interact* with *things* is to *discriminate*—one cannot avoid *action*.

If one cannot avoid *action*, then they will inevitably encounter *opposition* (戾)—how could they avoid *defeat*?

Only by taking *non-action* as the *root* (本) and *action* as the *branches* (末), by *non-acting* yet *acting* without fail, can one *respond to things* with *abundance* (裕) and not *exhaust* their *intelligence*—who could be constrained?

Guangchengzi says: *"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat,"* meaning that by *having no knowledge* (无知), one can *know nothing* (无不知)—what *defeat* is there?

Those who *cling* will *lose*—
**Huizong’s Annotation:** The Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness* (时). To *cling* without transforming is to lose *timeliness*—this is called *contrary to the Dao*.

**Explication:** *Timeliness* cannot be *stopped*, the Dao/Way cannot be *blocked*—*timeliness* shifts without pause, the Dao/Way adapts to change, hence the Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness*.

*Things* have no fixed *appropriateness* (宜)—*appropriateness* lies in *following the times*. If one *clings* without *losing*, if they are *stuck in one narrow view* (泥於一曲), then to *lose* is to *exceed*, and to *follow* is to *fall short*—how could they avoid *loss*?

Only by *transforming with the times* (与时俱化) and *having no fixed action* (无有专为) can one neither *lose timeliness* nor *contrary to the Dao*.

The *Yijing* says: *"The meaning of following the times is vast indeed."*

Hence, *things* either *move* (行) or *follow* (随), *inhale* (嘘) or *exhale* (吹), *strengthen* (强) or *weaken* (赢), *bear fruit* (载) or *wither* (隳).

**Huizong’s Annotation:** The *principles* (理) of myriad *things*: some *move*, some *follow*—like the *eclipse* (往来) of sun and moon. Some *inhale*, some *exhale*—like the *cycles* (相代) of the four seasons. Some *strengthen*, some *weaken*—like the *ascendancy* (王) and *decline* (废) of the five phases. Some *bear fruit*, some *wither*—like the *growth* (开) and *fall* (落) of grasses and trees.

*Serving the times* (役于时) yet *bound by numbers* (制于数), inevitably one cannot escape *burden*—only the Sage can avoid being burdened by *things* and stand alone above all *things*.

*Going alone, coming alone*—this is called *having alone* (独有). The one who *has alone* is called the *most noble* (至贵).

Thus, *operating* the *divine instrument* leaves *abundance*—though *things* vary in their *states*, the Sage’s *heart* remains ever unified.

**Explication:** When it is said to *go*, the moon comes; sun and moon alternate in their *illumination*—never ceasing, like the *principles* of *things* that either *move* or *follow*. Spring comes first, summer follows—seasons cycle without end, like the *principles* of *things* that either *inhale* or *exhale*.

When wood *strengthens*, water *weakens*—when fire *arises*, metal is *bound*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *strengthen* or *weaken*, as in the *ascendancy* and *decline* of the five phases. When grain *dies*, wheat *grows*—when trees *fall*, the *millet* (鞠) *blossoms*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *bear fruit* or *wither*, as in the *growth* and *fall* of grasses and trees.

From *moving* and *following* to *bearing fruit* and *withering*, all are *served by timeliness*—thus they *end with timeliness*, *bound by numbers*—thus they *exhaust with numbers*. This is why they *cycle endlessly* yet cannot escape *burden*.」

The Sage who transcends time and does not end with it,
who departs from numbers and does not exhaust with them—
what burden could there be?

The Sage understands this:
embodying the *Way*’s *non-being*, thus not burdened by *things*,
embodying the *Way*’s *virtue*, thus standing alone above all *things*.

The *Way* within me—*things* cannot pair with it.
Thus, when moving, there is no cause to move,
and so it is *solely moving*.
Thus, when coming, there is no source from which it comes,
and so it is *solely coming*.

Without bestowal, yet ever spontaneous—
this may be called the utmost nobility.

The subtlety of *non-being* lies here—
how could the *doer* fail or the *grasper* lose?

Thus, the Sage wields the *spiritual instrument* with ease.

The Sage’s heart transcends *being* and *non-being*,
unburdened by *things*—
so when *things* shift and intertwine, my *principles* do not alter.
This is why, though *things* vary in form, the heart remains one.

Therefore, the Sage rejects excess, rejects extravagance, rejects excessiveness.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The Sage perceives the transformations of all *things*,
knows that fullness brings manifold burdens,
and so does not augment life,
does not indulge nature,
does not reach extremes,
but plays within the *measure* alone.

If so, how could the *doer* be bound or the *grasper* err?

Thus it is said:
Elaborate rituals and superficial adornments bring no benefit to governance.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*Things* flourish then decay—
thus there is change.
Fullness invites loss—
thus there are burdens.

The Sage knows that *moving* and *following*,
*inhale* and *exhale*,
*strengthen* and *weaken*,
*bear fruit* and *wither*—
these cycles do not cease.
Thus, perceiving the transformations of all *things*,
knowing the burdens of fullness,
the Sage follows their spontaneity without augmentation,
takes *moderation* as standard without excess,
preserves internally and externally without sway,
and does not indulge nature—
this is called *playing within the measure*.

To *play within the measure* is to walk in the *Unnamed*.
The *Unnamed*—this is the *Way*.
To walk in the *Way*—
how could there be the afflictions of excess or extravagance?

Guarding the source of nature,
harmonizing with the *Way* in its turns,
governing the world—
embodying *non-action*,
thus no failure in *non-action*,
aligning with the utmost transformation,
thus no loss in *grasping*—

Those who indulge in elaborate rituals and superficial adornments
are yet burdened by the afflictions of excess and extravagance—
how could they benefit governance?

**End of *Explanations on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Six**
**End of *Explanations on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Seven**

**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* by Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy**
**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**

To assist the sovereign with the Dao is to **not** subdue the world with arms.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the *end* of virtue.
The *end* refers to what ancient sages possessed but did not prioritize.

To assist the sovereign with the Dao is to focus on the *root* alone, hence one does not subdue the world with arms.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Zhuangzi spoke of five *ends* in governance, and the deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the *end* of virtue. The *root* is the cultivation of spirit, heart, and method.

Arms cannot be abandoned, yet the five *ends* were possessed by the ancients.
The virtuous focus on the *root*, thus they did not prioritize them. To assist the sovereign with the Dao is to excel as a virtuous one—how could one drive the people to the brink of death and life, using coercion to subdue the world?

In days past, King Hui of Liang wished to avenge his humiliation by offering a single cup of wine to the dead of Chu. Mencius taught him that the virtuous have no rival—yet this was not by subduing the world with arms. This is the principle of *good returns*.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
This is what Mencius meant by *"return unto yourself."*

**Explanatory Commentary:**
If one acts with goodness, others will respond in kind. If one acts with harm, others will respond likewise. This is the law of *return unto oneself*. If one takes delight in warfare and killing, what manner of retribution will they receive? Hence, *good returns*.

Where the teacher treads, brambles grow.
After great armies, famine follows.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The lower ranks are drained of strength, hence brambles grow.
The ruler defies the natural order, hence there are years of scarcity.
The *Odes* say:
*"To pacify the myriad states,
And reap abundant harvests."*

To pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.
When the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds in kind.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Plowing without recklessness, weeding without destruction—this is the exertion of human effort.
Snow falls abundantly, rain nourishes the roots—this is the favor of Heaven’s timing.
Warfare is not the means to strengthen the land’s power.
To the point of draining the people’s strength, hence brambles grow.
Warfare is not the means to summon harmonious *qi*.
To the point of defying Heaven’s timing, hence there are years of scarcity.

The *Odes* say:
*"To pacify the myriad states,
And reap abundant harvests."*

To pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.
When the people are in harmony, they align with Heaven and Earth in one *qi*—
thus, when the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds.

This is a martial poem, differing from Laozi’s teachings,
to illustrate how the Sage’s intent surpasses the martial ambitions of men.
Thus, the good seek fulfillment alone,
and dare not claim strength through conquest.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
To seek what is right in action, to achieve completion in deeds,
to expend little effort yet see great results—
this is the Dao of the Sage.
To conquer through force is the mark of a cruel virtue,
hence victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Though undertakings differ, all seek what is right.
Though achievements differ, all seek completion.

Yet there are those who labor tirelessly yet see few results—
they do not grasp the root and the essential.

The Sage’s Dao is the foundation of the world,
and the key to governance lies here.
Thus, though effort is little, results are great.

As for displaying martial might and conquering by force,
how can this be deemed a virtuous path?

The ancient kings had ways of constant victory,
yet some turned left and right in retreat,
their campaigns failing without success—
they did not understand the Sage’s Dao.

The Sage’s Dao lies in harmonizing the people,
uniting their hearts and efforts,
so that no task is impossible,
no achievement unfulfilled,
and they stand unchallenged under Heaven—
as Leftist Master said: *"Victory lies in harmony, not in numbers."*

Mencius said: *"Geographical advantage is not as vital as the unity of the people."*
Gou Qing said: *"If the people and officers are not united,
even the likes of Tang and Wu could not triumph."*

Thus, true victory lies in harmony, not in numbers.

When success is achieved, do not boast,
do not claim glory,
do not grow arrogant,
do not act out of compulsion,
and do not force outcomes.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
Among those who act only when compelled,
the Sage’s Dao ensures victory through moderation and righteousness,
without blame—
success is sought, and that is all.

Boasting invites decline,
self-praise yields no merit,
arrogance invites contempt.
These four pitfalls must be avoided
to achieve success without coercion.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The Sage deliberates before acting,
and when success is attained,
it is as if responding to the Mandate of Heaven—
how could this be otherwise?
Much less so in war.

Victory through moderation brings good fortune,
righteousness brings no blame—
like the *Hexagram Nine-Two* of the *Yijing*.
To act in accordance with the natural order,
to move cautiously yet decisively,
to hunt like a skilled archer—
this is *"victory through moderation."*

To be yielding yet upright,
to guide the many with righteousness,
to speak with conviction without blame—
this is *"righteousness without blame."*

Yet the Sage does not wage war recklessly,
nor indulge in unquenchable martial ambition.
When compelled, resistance arises—
but self-boasting brings no growth,
self-praise yields no true merit,
arrogance invites disdain.
How could this be the way of the virtuous victor?

For killing the enemy is but one aspect of success—
if one achieves it without arrogance,
none dare contest their might.
If one achieves it without claiming glory,
none dare dispute their deeds.
If one achieves it without arrogance,
their victory endures unchallenged.
Thus, their achievements stand unrivaled in the world.

**On the decline of strength:**
*"Things flourish and then decay."*

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The cycles of growth and decline are evident in summer’s length and autumn’s withering.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Where there is spring’s nourishment and summer’s growth,
there must be autumn’s austerity and winter’s death—
the Great Transformation moves subtly.
Who can perceive its workings?
*"Things flourish and then decay"*—
this is plain to see.

This is called *"not the Dao."*

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The Dao has no beginning or end,
and does not align with the transformations of things.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Its beginning has no origin—
who can trace its source?
Its end has no conclusion—
who can define its limit?
From antiquity, it has always existed,
yet it transcends all transformations.
Thus, the Dao does not conform to the changes of things.
The Dao and things are fundamentally apart—
hence, *"things flourish and then decay"* is called *"not the Dao."*

*"Not the Dao"* is early decline.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
To exist outside the Dao is to invite the contrast of flourishing and decay.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Bound within the Great Transformation,
rigidity becomes strength,
decay becomes weakness—
all things follow this pattern,
for they exist outside the Dao.
The Dao, enduring from ancient times,
knows no decay or vigor—
how could it follow such cycles?

---
**On martial prowess (Chapter Thirty-One):**
*"Fine weapons are ominous instruments—*
things naturally abhor them,
so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them."*

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
Auspicious events bring omens,
but weapons are instruments of misfortune—
hence, *"ominous."*
Weapons are stored yet used in due measure,
and those who follow the Dao display virtue rather than martial might—
thus, they do not dwell upon them.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
All phenomena arise from some origin,
and auspicious signs precede blessings—
this is the natural order.
When blessings manifest in things, they are called *"omens."*
Thus, the *Yijing* states that auspicious events bring omens.
But weapons are instruments of misfortune—
what auspicious sign could precede them?
Hence, they are *"ominous."*

Still, reckless warfare is akin to sacrilege,
and though the ancient kings did not abandon it,
those who conceal their virtue do not flaunt their might,
and those who wage war without restraint leave no legacy—
thus, they do not display their armies.

As the *Commentaries* say: *"Weapons are stored yet used in due measure"*—
this refers to such conduct.

King Wu stored his arms and discarded his bows,
seeking virtuous governance to restore the Xia—
this was displaying virtue without martial show.

Moreover, martial prowess is a hidden virtue,
concealed like a crown or a wrapped foot—
it is advanced like a footstep, yet unused.
Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.

Hence, the gentleman values the left in peace,
but the right in war.

Weapons are ominous instruments,
not the tools of the gentleman.

**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**
The left embodies *yang*—generative, life-affirming—
the right embodies *yin*—destructive, punitive.
*Yang* is virtue, *yin* is punishment—
the gentleman honors virtue and fears punishment,
thus weapons are *"not the gentleman’s instrument."*

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The Great Dao is vast and unbounded,
yet it has left and right—
thus, the left is *yang*, the right is *yin*.
*Yin* and *yang* are the origins of life and death—
*yang* governs life, *yin* governs death.
Virtue governs life, hence Guanzi says *yang* is virtue,
punishment governs death, hence Guanzi says *yin* is punishment.
When virtue is complete, it ascends—
nothing can diminish it,
thus the gentleman values virtue.
When punishment is to be applied,
music is silenced—
thus the gentleman fears punishment.
Hence, ominous instruments are not the gentleman’s tools.
They are used only when compelled,
with calm resolve as the highest virtue.

Thus, it is not beautiful—
if it were beautiful, one would delight in it,
and delighting in it would mean delighting in killing people.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
To suppress tyranny and quell chaos,
one acts only when forced—
thus, it is unavoidable.
Without the intent to conquer others,
it is said that *tranquility and composure* are supreme.

Without the intent to conquer others,
warfare is not something to delight in,
thus it is not beautiful.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Warfare is an ominous instrument—
even the sage avoids it,
yet when the sage responds to the world
to secure the people,
the tyrannical cannot but be suppressed,
and when chaos arises,
it cannot but be quelled.
When the barbarian armies come to provoke divine retribution,
warfare is mobilized at the proper time—
one cannot but go.
The deployment of the three armies and five weapons
is the lowest extension of virtue.
The sage employs them—
how could this be his original intent?
It is merely because there is no alternative.

Thus, he habitually dwells in the realm of non-contention,
yet does not dare to act first for the world—
how could he take conquest as his heart’s desire?
It is because *tranquility and composure* are held supreme.
Those who delight in killing people
shall never find fulfillment in the world.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
When the ruler cherishes *ren* (benevolence),
the world has no rival.
To secure what is perilous and profit from what is harmful,
to delight in what leads to ruin—
this is where resentment gathers
and where calamity converges.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The benevolent have no rivals,
thus when the ruler cherishes *ren*,
the world has no rival.
If this is not understood,
then when drums clash and soldiers leap into battle,
it is as if one secures what is perilous without fear,
profits from what is harmful without caution,
and delights in what leads to ruin without shame—
how could this not invite resentment
and summon calamity?

How could one know that the ruler’s warfare
is rooted in *ren* and *yi* (righteousness),
executed through punishment and retribution,
used only when necessary,
and abandoned when peace returns—
as a means to ensure enduring stability?

For auspicious matters, the left is honored;
for inauspicious matters, the right is honored.
Thus, the *Pianjiangjun* (Vanguard General) is stationed on the left,
and the *Shangjiangjun* (Commander-in-Chief) on the right.
When occupying a position of dominance,
one observes funeral rites.
When many are slain,
one mourns them with sorrowful weeping.
When victorious in battle,
one observes funeral rites.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The *Yijing* calls warfare *"poison for the world"*—
even if victorious, there will be those afflicted by its effects,
thus those in dominant positions and the victorious
are treated with funeral rites.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
In the *Yijing*’s *"Warfare"* hexagram:
*"With this, you poison the world,
yet the people follow you."*
The ruler’s warfare is meant to shelter the people and gather forces—
though victorious, it is like a physician gathering poisonous medicines to attack illness,
and there will inevitably be those harmed by its effects.
Thus, the *Yijing* calls warfare *"poison for the world,"*
and those in dominant positions and the victorious
are treated with funeral rites.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**

---

The *Dao* is the origin of heaven and earth—how could it be named?
**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The *Dao* is the origin of heaven and earth—how could it be named?

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The unnameable is the origin of heaven and earth.
The *Dao* is that which gives birth to heaven and earth—
thus it cannot be named.
Though *pu* (crude simplicity) is small,
nothing under heaven can subdue it.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
*Pu* (crude simplicity) is used to illustrate the complete *Dao*.
When the *Dao* manifests as form and name, the great prevails over the small.
The complete *Dao* does not depart from its essence—
small yet discerning, as Zhuangzi said:
*"Within it, the True Lord abides."*

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Zhuangzi said:
*"In harmony with desirelessness, this is called *sùpǔ* (unadulterated simplicity)."*
The *Classic* states:
*"When *pu* (crude simplicity) disperses, it becomes *qì* (vessels)."*
*Pu* illustrates the complete *Dao*—
the great lies above, few yet overcoming all things;
the small lies below, many yet overcome by things.
Only when the *Dao* manifests as form and name does it appear thus.
Yet the complete *Dao* itself does not establish any single thing—
it cannot be grasped, thus it is called *wēi* (subtle).
In perfect unity with essence, it returns to the most profound,
and can be named only as *xiǎo* (small).
This *Dao* does not cling to form,
nor is it confined to number.
The True Lord is sufficient to tower above the world—
not like those bound by square forms and burdened by size,
thus nothing under heaven dares to subdue it.

If rulers and kings could uphold it,
all things would naturally submit as guests.
**Huizong’s Annotation:**
When the *Dao* suffices as the master of all things,
all things will naturally submit as guests.

Zhuangzi said:
*"In unadulterated simplicity, the people’s nature is attained."*
To govern all things without reliance on coercion or punishment,
this is the *Dao*’s limit.

**Explanatory Commentary:**
The *Analects* say:
*"Why should not all follow this *Dao*?"*
Zhuangzi said:
*"That which moves among all things is the *Dao*."*
The *Dao* is like the root of all things,
and all things reverence the *Dao*.
If one can uphold the *Dao*,
then all things submit as guests.
Zhuangzi said:
*"In unadulterated simplicity, the people’s nature is attained."*
*Pu* is the complete *Dao*—
to embody the *Dao* is to attain the people’s nature,
and its meaning aligns precisely with this.

In the *Yijing*, it is said:
*"The sages observe the *shén* (mysterious/numenous) *Dao* in setting their teachings,
and all under heaven submit."*
Then, if one can govern all things,
what need is there for coercion or punishment?

Heaven and earth unite,
and sweet dew descends—
no one commands it,
yet all is balanced.
**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The pure and simple *Dao*,
if upheld without loss,
is not merely that all things submit as guests—
it reaches to the heavens above,
and coils around the earth below.
When the upper and lower flow in harmony with heaven and earth,
then the *Dao*’s circulation brings unity,
and all things share its beneficence.
Sweet dew is the *héqi* (harmonious *qi*) of heaven and earth.

The *Commentary* says:
*"The virtue of the emperor and king
reaches to *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity),
descends to *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility),
and embraces all living things—
then sweet dew descends."*

**Explanatory Commentary:**
Pure means no loss of its spirit,
simple means no admixture with other things.
The pure and simple *Dao* guards only the spirit—
if one can uphold it without loss,
then it merges with the spirit,
and the unity of its precision
harmonizes with the natural order of heaven.
How could it merely submit things?
To unite with heaven above,
then the upper merges with the *yuánhuà* (primordial transformation);
to descend with earth below,
then the lower embraces *hòudé* (profound virtue).
Spirit pervades the four directions—
above, it reaches to heaven;
below, it coils around earth.
When it flows in harmony with heaven and earth,
then the two unite in accord,
and sweet dew descends.
Which thing could fail to share in its beneficence?

The *Húguānzǐ* says:
*"The virtue of the emperor and king
reaches to *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity),
descends to *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility),
and embraces all living things—
then sweet dew descends."*

Heaven’s tranquility is *wúwéi* (non-action),
thus it is called *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity).
To reach *Tàiqīng* is to unite with heaven above.
Earth’s tranquility is *wúwéi* (non-action),
thus it is called *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility).
To descend to *Tàiníng* is to coil with earth below.
Only humans are the living souls of all things—
to embrace *wànlíng* (all living things) is to encompass all things,
thus sweet dew descends.

At first, there was no naming—
once naming was established,
one must also know when to stop.
To know when to stop is to avoid peril.
**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The sequence of the Great *Dao*:
five transformations until form and name can be raised.
When form is raised and named,
the *Dao* descends and virtue decays—
the pure is diluted, *pu* (crude simplicity) is dispersed,
and none can halt it.

The benevolent of the world
cast their eyes downward and grieve over the world’s exhaustion,
while the unvirtuous
prioritize life and death’s desires
and glut themselves on wealth and honor.
The sage is not thus.
When naming first arises,
he stands alone, his form unyielding—
how could he follow things in their transformations?
Serene and self-sufficient, dwelling with spirit and clarity—
how could this not suffice as rest?
Rather, he halts it,
and firmly grasps it.
To halt within flow is to move while remaining true—
if so, who could endanger him?

The reason why it is not in peril thus.

Compare the *Dao* in the world
to the streams and valleys uniting with the rivers and seas.

*Xuanzong* annotated: "The world, a single nature.
The *Dao* in the world, harmonizing through nature,
is like the streams and valleys uniting with the rivers and seas—
gathered by water, those alike are nourished,
those of kindred nature respond.
When the sage governs with this,
what need is there for action?
It is merely to follow nature."

*Shuyi* elaborated: "Life differs in form, yet all share one nature.
For all that live, this nature exists—
thus, the world has a single nature.
The *Dao*'s complete essence
does not depart from nature;
the sage attains its purity,
so all who possess nature
are united by it,
just as the rivers and seas
are good at descending
and all streams and torrents flow into them.
Gathered by water,
those alike are nourished,
those of kindred nature respond—
when the sage governs,
resting with hands folded,
the world is in harmony.
What need is there for action?
It is merely to transform the people
by following their nature."

Knowing people is wisdom—*Zhizhe* (Knowing People) Chapter 33.

「Huizong’s annotation states: The *Commentary* says, “Wisdom is like the eye—able to see a hundred paces away, yet unable to see its own eyelashes.” To discern the deceitful or upright in others, as one distinguishes white from black, is the work of wisdom—knowing people is all.

*Shuyi* further expounds: “Gazing upon the minute hairs of a moth in autumn, these are the most subtle of things; even at a distance of a hundred paces, a keen-eyed observer can still perceive them. Yet the eyelashes of a man are close at hand—even if one were to summon the legendary *Zhujia* (離朱, "the far-seeing") to squint and scrutinize them in broad daylight, he would not see them. So too is human wisdom: one can discern others, yet cannot truly know oneself. This is what *Han Fei* records of *Duzi* (杜子, "Master Du")—that wisdom is like the eye, able to see a hundred paces away, yet unable to see its own eyelashes.

*Mengzi* (Mencius) says: The faculty of distinguishing right from wrong is the beginning of wisdom.
*Zuozi* (苟子, "Master Zuo") says: To affirm what is right and deny what is wrong is what we call wisdom. To discern the deceitful or upright in others, as one distinguishes white from black, is to affirm what is right and deny what is wrong. Thus, wisdom as the eye can see what is external yet cannot self-examine—it can only know others.

But self-knowledge is clarity.

Huizong’s annotation states: The *Yijing* (易經, *Classic of Changes*) says, “To recover is to know oneself.” The *Commentary* says: “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.” Wisdom, in knowing others, becomes entangled in interaction—this is called *xinzhou* (心鬥, "mental contention"), or using one’s mind to vie with others. Yet to recover and know oneself is to remain still and return to the root—seeing oneself is all. It is the balance of heaven and earth, the illumination of all things.

*Shuyi* further expounds: To recover the subtle and discern in things, to return to the root and be still—stillness brings clarity, and there is nothing it does not penetrate. Hence, the *Yijing* says, “To recover is to know oneself.” To inwardly gaze is to see without attachment, to see others yet truly see oneself—thus, the *Commentary* says, “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.”

To employ wisdom in discerning the deceitful or upright in others is to uphold what is right and reject what is wrong, to look around and have all things respond—this is to engage in *xinzhou*, using an empty, unified, and tranquil mind to daily judge. The rectification of right and wrong is thus the work of knowing others, no more.

But to recover and know oneself is to inwardly observe the single nature, to remain still and return to the root, to see what others do not see and to perceive the unseen forms—thus attaining what is called *jianjian* (見見, "true seeing"). Is there anything greater than this in heaven and earth? To see is to attain its balance.

The myriad things are vast—is there anything greater than this? **Form** is their illumination.

If such is the case, then what we call *clarity* truly attains completion? Those who excel over others possess *power*, but those who conquer themselves are *strong*.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Sage values virtue/power over force, striving to conquer oneself rather than others."* The wise deceive the foolish, the brave endure the cowardly—this is excelling over others, relying on *power* alone. To conquer one’s own selfishness, maintaining rectitude without injury—this is conquering oneself. When one goes forth, standing alone without fear; when dwelling, retreating from the world without discontent—never venturing forth without triumph, this is the source of *strength*.

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The foolish cannot be trusted with schemes, so the wise employ their discernment to deceive them. The cowardly cannot stand against adversity, so the brave summon their vigor to endure them—this is the valuing of force to triumph over others. To conquer one’s selfishness with a resolute mind, nurturing non-harm and preserving one’s *qi*—this is the valuing of virtue/power to conquer oneself. Only by conquering oneself does one remain unshaken when external things press upon them, unable to destroy one’s true being. Thus, going forth, one stands alone without fear; dwelling, one retreats from the world without discontent. To stand alone yet fear nothing is to be brave in *righteousness*. To retreat from the world yet feel no discontent is to find peace in *fate*. Whether one goes forth or dwells, never venturing without triumph—this is why they are called *ultimately strong*."*

Those who know sufficiency are rich. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"To possess myriad differences is what we call richness."* The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The myriad transformations of existence bear distinct names, yet they do not lose their essence—this is ultimate richness, where the measure of sufficiency resides in one’s self. As Zhuangzi said: 'To possess myriad differences is what we call richness.' Only those who know sufficiency roam within the *boundaries* (of the body), finding sufficiency in themselves. Thus, their head is round, their feet square, and heaven and earth take their place; their chest faces south, their back north, and yin and yang are fully embraced. All things have their limits, yet all are complete—what riches of Jin and Chu could compare? The sufficiency of those who know sufficiency is everlasting, hence the treasures of the realm gather within them."*

Those who act with *strength* possess *will*.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"To persist in self-strengthening is to uphold *will* in the Dao/Way."* The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"To exert oneself in study and inquiry broadens one’s knowledge and sharpens wisdom; to exert oneself in practicing the Dao/Way awakens virtue/power and yields great achievements. Thus, those who strive in action rely on self-strengthening, and self-strengthening is what we call having *will*. The *Daoist Classic on Virtue/Power* says: 'The Superior Sage hears the Dao/Way and moves to act upon it.' Truly, those who uphold *will* in the Dao/Way—hearing the Dao/Way and moving to act—accumulate true strength over time, persisting in self-strengthening without end. Could this be done by those without *will*? Those who do not lose their place endure long; those who conform to time and shift with things can only last temporarily. The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"If one can embody the eternal without change, steadfast in what they guard, they can then let the Dao/Way unfold in action, enduring boundlessly. In the *Book of Changes*, the *Commentary* speaks of the Sage standing firm without shifting direction, and the *Symbol* says: 'The Sage endures long in their Dao/Way.' This is precisely what is meant. If one is confined by time and shifts with things, how could they not lose their place? The aged and the young transform, and one shifts with them—could they truly not lose their place?"*

Those who die yet do not perish are *long-lived*.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Life has its root in growth, death has its return in origin; tracing the beginning and returning to the end, one understands the teachings of death and life."* The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The Sage comprehends the Dao/Way of day and night, knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life. Thus, their form dissolves, yet their spirit does not perish, enduring alongside heaven and earth without known limit—what else could be called *long-lived*? This chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principles, proceeds to knowing sufficiency to fulfill nature, and concludes with not perishing to attain *fate*—thus, creation dwells within us. Who but those without past or future, entering the realm of neither death nor life, could attain this? The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"All things: life emerges from the One, death returns to the One. Life has its root in growth, death has its end in return. To trace the beginning and know the teachings of death—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'Mingled between the coarse and the fine, it transforms and gives rise to *qi*; *qi* transforms and gives rise to form, now again transforming into death.' To return to the end and know the teachings of life—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'How do I know that the dead do not regret their life? Perhaps their joy lies in the firewood’s first sprouting.' Beginning and end oppose the boundless, yet no one knows where they end—how could death and life be fundamentally different? It is merely the One, threading through all. Day and night alternate, dividing into darkness and light, and all things flow in the space between heaven and earth, serving the cycles of day and night. Day and night succeed one another, just as life and death replace each other. Those confined by time and shifting with things are destined to be overtaken by the bounds of day and night. Only the enlightened know that all is One, that death and life are but a single thread. Though they come and go with things, there is what we call 'not coming,' though they move with things, there is what we call 'not moving.' Knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life, their form undergoes myriad changes, dissolving with time, yet their true nature remains serene, their spirit unperishing. Thus, comprehending the Dao/Way of day and night, they know their independence—this is the ultimate One. Heaven endures long, earth persists forever, and together they endure without limit. Their *long-lived* nature knows no bounds."*

This chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principles, proceeds to knowing sufficiency to fulfill nature, and concludes with not perishing to attain *fate*—thus, creation dwells within us.

Thus, exhausting principles reveals no obstruction—hence, knowing others is to exhaust principles;
fulfilling nature leaves no desire—hence, knowing sufficiency is to fulfill nature;
realizing the essence of *fate* governs all things without constraint—hence, death without perishing is to attain *fate*.

The *Yijing* speaks of exhausting principles, fulfilling nature, and attaining *fate*—its sequence aligns with this chapter’s meaning.

When one attains *fate*, the marvels of creation arise from within oneself.
Morning clarity reveals solitude, merging in obscurity with the Dao,
transcending time’s measure, beyond the bounds of past and future,
free from form and body, untouched by life and death’s dominion.

Zhuangzi spoke of neither ancient nor modern, entering the realm of neither death nor life—this is what is meant.

**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**

The Great Dao flows—it may turn left or right.
*Huizong’s Annotation*: Flowing without attachment, it neither loses motion nor stillness, nor exhausts coming and going—left or right, it knows no impossibility.

*Exegesis*: The interplay of yin and yang is the Dao—left is yang, right is yin. Thus, flowing without attachment, it may turn left or right.

*The Taixuan* says: "Without attachment is the sage."
Zhuangzi says: "There is left and right, yet no attachment."

Thus, it does not cling to one side, yet left and right exist.
If so, motion and stillness lie within—like yin and yang’s ebb and flow in filling and emptying, what loss can there be?
Then motion and stillness are unerring.

Coming and going lie within—like the moon’s successive illumination creating day and night, what exhaustion can there be?
Then coming and going are boundless.

Take from the left, and it is left; take from the right, and it is right—
no gate, no side, four-way expansive, yet all reach their source.
How can it be stored and not attained?

All things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse.
Its work done, it does not dwell upon it.

*Huizong’s Annotation*: It gives to those who depart, supplies those who seek—
all things form and transform themselves, wise and strong in their own right,
yet it does not claim their merit.
Like the four seasons: when one departs, another takes its place.
Wood thrives as water wanes—its work done, it departs.
Who would claim it as their own?

*Exegesis*: It gives to those who depart—
as Zhuangzi said, "All things depart, yet it supplies them without depletion."
It supplies those who seek—
as Zhuangzi said, "The utmost void fulfills all seeking."
Since it gives to those who depart and supplies those who seek,
yet remains untangled, life and transformation, wisdom and strength
are all entrusted to their own nature—
why claim their merit?
Like the four seasons: when *wu* emerges, *ding* retreats;
wood flourishes as water declines—
its work done, it departs.
Who would acknowledge it as their own?

It clothes all things yet is not their master—
thus, it is ever without desire, worthy of being called *small*.
All things return to it, yet it knows no master—
worthy of being called *great*.

*Huizong’s Annotation*: The Dao, in its utmost obscurity, is *small* yet distinct from things;
in its utmost transformation, it is *great* yet interacts with things.
Distinct from things, it is ever without desire;
interacting with things, all things return to it.
It covers and reveals all things yet does not display its sovereign power—
thus, it is not their master.
It stirs and guides the multitude yet no one discerns its path—
thus, it knows no master.

The Dao is not *small* or *great*—what is called *small* or *great*
are but its manifestations in things.

*Exegesis*: Its essence penetrates the spirit—*small* in its obscurity,
its radiance shines forth—*great* in its transformation.
Thus, in its utmost obscurity, it is *small* and distinct from things;
in its utmost transformation, it is *great* and interacts with things.
The Heavenly Dao ascends to the north—its time of retreat;
descends to the south—its time of departure.
Southward interaction, northward distinction—
thus, the Dao in its utmost obscurity is *small* and distinct from things,
in its utmost transformation is *great* and interacts with things.
Distinct from things, self and objects are forgotten—
thus, it is ever without desire.
Interacting with things, it yields and adapts—
thus, all things return to it.
It covers and reveals all things yet does not display its sovereign power—
thus, it is not their master (from its inherent nature).
It stirs and guides the multitude yet no one discerns its path—
thus, it knows no master (from its outward manifestation).

Moreover, the Dao covers and carves all things,
yet does not boast of its craft—
thus, in covering all things, it does not display its sovereign power.
Only by not displaying its power does it not claim mastery.
It stirs and guides to exhaust the spirit—
thus, in stirring the multitude, no one discerns its path.
Only by not revealing its traces does it remain unknown as master.

The Dao is neither *small* nor *great*—
what is called *small* or *great* is not its true constancy,
but its manifestations in things.
When it manifests in things, it is no longer the Dao beyond form.
Thus, the sage never claims *greatness*—
only then can they achieve true *greatness*.

*Huizong’s Annotation*: Their deeds cover the world yet seem not their own—
thus, their achievements are vast and abundant.
Mencius said: "To transform the great is to be sage."
To transform the great is to not be burdened by *greatness*—
thus, they achieve true *greatness*.

*Exegesis*: With solid substance and radiance, this is *great*.
*Great* not yet detached from form—
form’s *greatness* cannot transform without flaw.
Only through ceaseless change does it attain the name *sage*,
free from the burden of *greatness*.
Free from the burden of *greatness*, it does not cling to *greatness*—
thus, it achieves true *greatness*.

---
**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**

**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**

Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes.
*Huizong’s Annotation*: The Symbol is like the heavens in its manifestation—
without action, yet moving by fixed rhythms;
without speech, yet revealing through patterns.
The sage governs the world by resting in non-action,
by walking the silent instruction,
and the people turn to them as to parents—
thus it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.

*Exegesis*: The heavens manifest the Symbol,
and the sage follows its lead.
The heavens’ manifestation is smooth yet without stagnation,
circulating endlessly without pause—
its movement is vigorous and unflagging.
What need does it have for action?

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Non-action as its action is the heaven’s way."*
*The Book of Changes* says: *"The heaven’s movement is vigorous."*
This is non-action yet moving by vigor.

The stars revolve, the clouds and rainbows appear and vanish—
its patterns are visible,
yet how does the heaven speak?

*Zhuangzi* says: *"The heaven and earth have great virtue yet do not speak."*
*The Book of Changes* says: *"Gazing upward to observe the heaven’s patterns."*
This is speechless yet revealing through patterns.

The sage’s governance of the world embodies the heaven’s transformations,
grasping the Great Symbol to show the people—
like the heaven’s manifestation,
resting in non-action,
though acting yet never crossing the boundary of non-action;
walking silent instruction,
though teaching yet never uttering the intent of speech.

Thus, the people’s turning to them
is like water flowing downward—
their love is as close as parents,
their attachment unbreakable as glue and lacquer.
Hence it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.

As for the Great Symbol,
it is seen yet cannot be grasped—
the *Classics* say: *"The Great Symbol is formless."*

All come yet none are harmed.
*Huizong’s Annotation*: When yin and yang are harmonious and tranquil,
spirits and gods do not disturb,
all living things are uninjured,
ten thousand things flourish without withering,
and though the people may have knowledge,
they lack use for it—
what harm could there be?

*Exegesis*: The sage regulates heaven and earth through yin and yang,
thus yin and yang are harmonious and tranquil—
as *Liezi* says: *"Yin and yang constantly adjust."*
By the Dao they move all under Heaven,
thus spirits and gods do not disturb—
as *Liezi* says: *"The spirits have no response."*
They fulfill the needs of all living things,
and all living things cling to their homeland—
thus all living things are uninjured—
as *Liezi* says: *"Humans suffer no untimely evil."*
They nurture all ten thousand things,
and all ten thousand things find their proper place—
thus ten thousand things do not wither—
as *Liezi* says: *"Things have no flaws or diseases."*

Wondrous yet forming yin and yang,
profound yet forming spirits and gods,
abundant yet forming all living things,
dispersed yet forming ten thousand things—
none but what is properly placed.
This is called *the utmost unity*,
and thus they perpetually make the people without knowledge or desire.

Though the people may have knowledge,
they lack use for it—
this is the greatest benefit to all under Heaven,
and thus there is no harm.

Stability, peace, and flourishing.
*Huizong’s Annotation*: Stability means no fear of peril or ruin,
peace means no risk of danger or unevenness,
flourishing is when all is thorough and well-governed.

*Exegesis*: Stability is the opposite of danger,
so stability means no fear of peril or ruin—
this is *"all under Heaven is perpetually stable."*
Peace is the opposite of unevenness,
so peace means no risk of danger or unevenness—
this is *"all under Heaven is uniformly level."*
Flourishing is the opposite of stagnation,
flourishing is when blessings extend downward—
thus *The Book of Changes* says: *"Flourishing is thorough and well-governed."*

From stability to peace,
from peace to flourishing—
governance’s effects are thus,
and without holding to the ancient Dao to govern the present,
who could achieve this?

Music and bait—
passing travelers pause.
*Huizong’s Annotation*: Those who delight in sounds and flavors
are burdened by things.
Burdened by things yet unable to free themselves,
things bind them—
thus they pause.

*Exegesis*: Their nature is tied to the Five Sounds,
so the ears crave excessive tones,
and the Five Sounds confuse the ears,
making the ears dull.
Their nature is tied to the Five Flavors,
so the mouth craves extreme tastes,
and the Five Flavors—*mà* [overindulgence]—
make the mouth lose its sharpness.
Thus, those who delight in sounds and flavors
are burdened by things.

Burdened by things,
the inner and outer *wèi* [vital forces] become tangled and convoluted,
and none can untie them.
Yet those who cannot free themselves
do not know to loosen and open their paths—
things bind them.
Even passing travelers, unable to rest,
will pause for them.

The Dao’s speech is bland yet without flavor.
To look upon it is insufficient to see,
to listen to it is insufficient to hear,
to use it is never exhausted.

*Huizong’s Annotation*: What the flavor flavors has been tasted,
yet the flavor itself has never been presented—
thus it is bland yet without flavor.
What the color colors is made clear,
yet the color itself has never been displayed—
thus to look upon it is insufficient to see.
What the sound sounds has been heard,
yet the sound itself has never been emitted—
thus to listen to it is insufficient to hear.
If so, they can endure bitterness and sweetness,
can embrace depth and brightness,
can harmonize with *gōng* [first pitch] and *shāng* [second pitch],
without knowing yet without not knowing,
without ability yet without inability—
thus to use it is never exhausted.

*Exegesis*: The heavens have the Five Phases,
which transform into the Five Flavors,
beginning with bland and ending with sweet—
all are what the flavor flavors.
What the flavor flavors has been tasted,
yet the flavor itself has never been presented—
this is *"the flavor of the world,"*
as *Zhuangzi* says.
The Five Colors are made clear,
whether by probing their origins or examining their substances—
all are what the color colors.
What the color colors is made clear,
yet the color itself has never been displayed—
this is *"the noble is without color,"*
as *The Book of Changes* says.
The Five Sounds are distinguished:
clear and turbid, high and low,
reaching and returning, expansive and tight—
all are what the sound sounds.
What the sound sounds has been heard,
yet the sound itself has never been emitted—
this is *"the great sound is rare,"*
as the *Classics* say.
True speech is not beautiful,
thus the Dao’s speech is bland yet without flavor,
yet can flavor all under Heaven’s flavors.

The Dao is without form yet perfect,
thus when seen it cannot be perceived,
yet it can manifest all under Heaven’s hues.
It has no sound, no scent,
thus when heard it cannot be detected,
yet it can produce all under Heaven’s tones.

To flavor all under Heaven’s tastes,
it can be both sweet and bitter;
to manifest all under Heaven’s colors,
it can be both dark and yellow;
to sound all under Heaven’s tones,
it can be both *gong* and *shang*.

Without taste, unseen, unheard,
it seems as though it knows nothing, can do nothing—
yet it can flavor all flavors,
can sound all sounds,
can manifest all colors.
Its operations are boundless, its uses inexhaustible,
thus it knows all, can do all.

Therefore, *Liezi* argues that form gives rise to sound and taste,
yet concludes: *"without knowing, without ability—*
*yet without not-knowing, without not-ability,"*
thus it is said: *"Its use cannot be exhausted."*

The *Transmission* says:
*"Without sound, the Five Tones resound;
without taste, the Five Flavors emerge;
without color, the Five Colors are complete.*
Is this not what is meant?

Now, the chapter on *"The Desire to Withdraw"*—the thirty-sixth.

To withdraw it, one must first fully extend it;
To weaken it, one must first fully strengthen it;
To set it in motion, one must first fully arouse it;
To take from it, one must first fully give to it.

The *Huizong* annotation states:
*"Yin and Yang illuminate, envelop, and regulate one another;
The Four Seasons succeed, generate, and destroy one another.
This is the principle of all things, the transmission of human order.
In their gathering and dispersing, their flourishing and decline,
their rise and fall, their deficiency and fullness—
often these shifts emerge from the most subtle beginnings,
yet their signs are invisible to most.
Only the sagely few, who delve into the *ji* (微妙之机),
can foresee their auspicious outcomes.
The virtuous nearly approach this understanding."*

When Yang flourishes in summer, Yin arises at *wu* (午);
When Yin congeals in winter, Yang arises at *zi* (子).

King Goujian sought to weaken Wu, yet urged it to attack Qi;
Zhi Bo sought to seize You Yu, yet gifted him a grand carriage.
Thus the Sage, seeing frost and knowing the coming of solid ice,
understands the waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness—
not fixed in their outward forms.
Hence, even the bold cannot weaken, and the wise cannot take.

The *Exegesis* explains:
*"The movement of Yin and Yang—
when one wanes, the other waxes, illuminating and enveloping,
rising and descending, regulating one another—
this is how Yin and Yang envelop, illuminate, and regulate.
The Four Seasons proceed: cold and heat alternate,
generating and destroying in succession—
the King generates, Ren conquers—
this is how the Four Seasons succeed, generate, and destroy.
Thus, all things disperse into myriad forms,
their principles unsaid, their human order transmitted without end.
When gathering reaches its peak, dispersion already stirs—
thus extension and withdrawal arise.
When flourishing peaks, decline follows—
thus weakness and strength emerge.
Whether in sudden anger or collapse, rise or fall,
whether in loss or gain, taking or giving—
these shifts begin before signs appear,
even divine vision cannot perceive their forms.
The *ji* often arises from the most subtle beginnings,
yet its portents remain unseen.
Only the Sage, discerning in the obscure,
acts brightly upon the faintest threads—
by probing deeply and mastering the *ji*,
they attain foresight of auspiciousness.
Though the virtuous may not fully grasp the *ji*,
yet if they act before chaos arises,
ordering before disorder—
they nearly approach this understanding."*

Now, when accumulated Yang brings summer’s heat,
Yang flourishes in summer—
yet *zi* (子) beauty has already waned,
and Yin is about to emerge.
When accumulated Yin brings winter’s cold,
Yin congeals in winter—
yet *wu* (午) beauty has reached its peak,
and Yang is about to arise.
As Yang Xiong said:
*"Yang does not reach its extreme before Yin does not stir,
Yin does not reach its extreme before Yang does not sprout."*
All these shifts—
withdrawal and extension, ruin and rise, alternating transformations—
are the workings of Heaven’s principle.

King Goujian sought to weaken Wu,
yet urged it to attack Qi—
to weaken it, he first strengthened it.
Zhi Bo sought to seize You Yu,
yet gifted him a grand carriage—
to take from him, he first gave to him.
Han Fei also said:
*"The Duke of Jin, intending to attack Yu,
gifted him jade and horses.
Zhi Bo, intending to seize You Yu,
gifted him a grand carriage.
Thus, to take from one, one must first give to them—
this is the intent."*

This is the way of human affairs.

「By examining Heaven’s principle and verifying human affairs,
all things conform to this truth.
This is how the Sage perceives patterns and discerns categories—
when Yin first congeals,
when frost is upon the ground and one knows the coming of solid ice.

Thus, when Heaven’s principle unfolds—
one aspect fading while another emerges,
one being full while another empties—
it does not depend on their outward forms,
but one can observe the essence of their transformations.
Though their signs may not yet appear,
their logic is clear and visible.

If so, then the withdrawal and extension of strength and weakness,
the rise and fall of ruin and prosperity,
of giving and taking, controlling and seizing—
these are self-regulating,
self-operating.
The bold dare not flaunt their vigor,
for their strength cannot weaken others;
the wise dare not deploy their cunning,
for their defenses cannot be taken.

In harmony with the Dao/Way,
Heaven’s course has already unfolded.
Only those who speak of great principles,
discuss the logic of all things,
can align with this.

This is called *subtle clarity* (微明).
Emperor Huizong annotated:
*"Before signs appear, it is subtle (微),
yet its logic is most evident (甚着)."*

Yang Xiong said in *The Taixuan* (《太玄》):
*"When water ebbs into the depths,
when wood decays from its branches,
the virtuous perceive it while the masses know not."*

The *Commentary* explains:
*"When one is in the midst of advancement,
it is manifest and easily seen;
when hidden in its unmanifest state,
it is concealed and difficult to know.
Withdrawal and extension, strength and weakness,
rise and fall, giving and taking,
controlling and seizing—
these mutually consume and flourish,
mutually rely and subdue.
Before their signs appear,
they are profound and obscure,
unseen in their progression,
concealed yet discernible by the subtle."*

From the perspective of inherent logic,
excess leads to decline,
exhaustion gives rise to rebirth,
cycling endlessly without pause.
Though hidden in no outward trace,
their inevitable course is clear and visible.
Thus, before signs appear, it is subtle (微),
yet their logic is most evident (甚着).

Yangzi composed *The Taixuan* (《太玄》), stating:
*"When water ebbs into the depths,
when wood decays from its branches,
the virtuous perceive it while the masses know not."*

The masses seek its description,
the virtuous grasp its logic.
Hence, the virtuous perceive it while the masses know not—
the masses differ from the virtuous in this.

Softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength.

Emperor Huizong annotated:
*"Only the Sage can accumulate many small unconquerables
into a great unconquerable."*

The *Classics* say:
*"Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming hardness and strength."*

In *Zhuangzi’s Outer Chapters* (《庄子·外篇》),
discussing the mutual regard of the Great Snake and the Wind,
it is said:
*"Point at me, and I will overcome you;
press against me, and I will overcome you—
yet in breaking great trees and toppling great houses,
only I can do it."*

The *Commentary* explains:
*"In terms of personal conduct,
hardness and strength suffice to overcome softness and weakness;
in terms of the Dao/Way,
softness and weakness suffice to overcome hardness and strength.
Softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength—
this is the Dao/Way’s logic.
Accumulate softness, and it becomes hardness;
accumulate weakness, and it becomes strength.
To seek hardness, one must guard it with softness;
to seek strength, one must preserve it with weakness.
Is this not the Dao/Way of perpetual victory?
This is what *Zhuangzi* meant when he said:
*'Only the Sage can accumulate many small unconquerables
into a great unconquerable.'*

Moreover, descending from the Dao/Way,
those closest to it are like water—
its nature is fluid and yielding,
making it the world’s ultimate softness,
yet able to overcome the world’s ultimate hardness.
As the *Classics* say:
*'Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming hardness and strength.'*

And so it is with the Wind—
when it enters through the *xun* (巽, southeast) direction,
its use is unparalleled in bending all things.
It too overcomes hardness and strength with softness and weakness.

In *Zhuangzi’s Outer Chapters* (《庄子·外篇》),
it is said of the Snake and the Wind:
*'Point at me, and I will overcome you;
press against me, and I will overcome you—
yet in breaking great trees and toppling great houses,
only I can do it.'*

Pointing at me, pressing against me, overcoming me—
this is the softness and weakness.
Breaking great trees, toppling great houses—
this is the overcoming of hardness and strength.

The *Transmission* (《传》) says:
*"Softness is the Dao/Way’s hardness,
weakness is the Dao/Way’s strength."*

Fish cannot be detached from the depths,
and the state’s sharpest tools
should not be displayed to the people.

Emperor Huizong annotated:
*"The depths are where fish conceal their bodies.
Sharp tools are the ruler’s ultimate authority,
by which all things are governed.
A fish that can swallow a boat,
if stranded and losing its water,
even ants can torment it—
thus it cannot be detached from the depths.
When the ruler shows favor,
subjects exploit its influence;
when the ruler inflicts punishment,
subjects wield its power.
Favor and punishment are the means of governance—
yet even these should not be displayed,
how much less the Dao/Way of governance itself?"*

The Sage wields sharp tools yet does not display them,
not for their strength,
but for the subtle Dao/Way within them.

One can exhaust the seas without gaining fame for wisdom,
command all things without earning credit for valor,
yet never rely on victory over others
to attain the Dao/Way of perpetual triumph.

Yang opens while Yin closes,
transformation endless.
Guiding the ministers,
moving the world—
none can fathom it.
Thus, they are governed without being governed.

Authority lies with the sovereign,
the key with the ruler—
and the world is in order.

The *Commentary* explains:
*"The depths are where water flows back upon itself,
the profound and unfathomable.
Fish hide and escape, submerged in the depths—
thus the depths are where fish conceal their bodies.
Sharp tools are the ruler’s supreme power,
by which all things are controlled.
Hence, authority lies above,
and subjects are governed by the ruler—
sharp tools are the state’s means of control.
Yet fish in water are like people in the Dao/Way:
one cannot for a moment depart from the Dao/Way,
so fish cannot for a moment lose their water.
A fish that can swallow a boat,
if stranded and losing its water,
even ants can torment it—
this is because it was detached from the depths.
Favor and punishment are visible incentives for the world;
when the ruler personally employs them,
the ministers fear his power and submit to his authority.
If favor is not bestowed with precision,
if punishment is not applied with thoroughness—
this is the ruler showing favor,
and the ministers will exploit its influence."*

When punishment of evil is not thorough,
this is the ruler showing punishment,
and the ministers will exploit its power.

Rewards and punishments are the tools of governance,
yet they must not be openly displayed—
how much more so the Dao/Way itself?
One may make people follow it,
but one must never let them comprehend it.

Han Fei also said:
Rewards and punishments are the state’s sharp tools.
When the ruler displays favor,
ministers will diminish it to claim virtue;
when the ruler displays punishment,
ministers will seize it to claim authority.
This is the same principle.

Thus, the state’s sharp tools
must never be openly shown.

The Sage wields these tools without revealing them,
not by brute force,
but by standing in the unfathomable,
acting in the unseen—
there lies a wondrous Dao within,
by which the divine instruments move without constraint,
and great things are achieved without loss.

One can exhaust the realm’s resources without exerting intelligence or strength—
not because intelligence or strength are absent,
but because their application is beyond naming.

One can command the realm’s submission without displaying valor—
not because valor is absent,
but because its deployment escapes the world’s gaze.

Thus, it is not a matter of deliberate conquest,
yet victory is ever secured.
Not fixated on conquering,
one attains the constant Dao of victory.

The expansion and contraction of the Dao’s attainment,
its opening with the Yang and closing with the Yin—
as the *Transmission* says:
*"With the Yin, close together;
with the Yang, open together."*

To know the divine’s workings,
and transform endlessly—
as the *Transmission* says:
*"Manifest in transformation."*

With this, one governs ministers and moves the world,
yet none can fathom it;
one controls others without being controlled—
who else could hold victory so?

This has no other source:
it lies in the ruler above.
Rectify the root, and all things align;
grasp the essential, and all things are governed.

Without deliberate governance,
the world is already governed.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**

*The Dao acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone.*

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Silent and unmoving,
yet responsive—
thus the world is naturally transformed.

**Explanatory Notes:**
The Dao has essence and function—
non-action is its essence,
yet its function is boundless action.

If one seeks the Dao through exclusive non-action,
one drowns in emptiness,
losing the Dao’s essence.
If one seeks the Dao through exclusive action,
one stagnates in form,
losing the Dao’s function.

Only in silent stillness,
non-action without neglecting action,
responding yet remaining in non-action—
only then does the Dao’s utmost subtlety
leave no trace behind.

If lords and kings could uphold this,
all things would transform of their own accord.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Just as water reflects form without effort,
so too the Dao’s contact with the world
requires no contrivance—
yet nothing can escape its shaping.

When lords and kings govern by the Dao,
they enter the realm of non-action,
yet emerge from it to transform all things,
as if by nature’s own doing—
unknown to those transformed,
hence *"self-transformation."*

**Explanatory Notes:**
A clear mirror reveals no dust;
still water reflects even eyebrows.
Water and mirrors respond without storing—
thus the *Transmission* says:
*"Like water reflecting form,
it requires no contrivance,
yet nothing can escape its shaping."*

How is the Dao’s response different?

Those who attain this
become emperors above,
kings below—
thus, if lords and kings uphold the Dao,
all things will transform of their own accord.

Before undertaking deeds or establishing enterprises—
this is the king’s Dao.
Moderating conduct and adhering to measure—
this is the lord’s duty.
Thus, lords and kings
are the pivot upon which all things depend.

If they truly uphold the Dao to govern the times,
their rule over the world and state will be effortless.

The Dao’s true essence governs the self;
its remnants govern the state;
its extensions govern the world.

Only by embodying the Dao’s non-being,
responding to the world’s manifestations,
intending action yet never acting,
intending non-action yet never ceasing—
entering the realm of non-action,
yet emerging from non-action—
thus transforming all things,
all is fulfilled without omission,
all is measured without exhaustion,
from sentient beings to the insentient—
none fail to be moved in perception,
and their transformation is balanced.

Like *qi* flowing through the cosmos,
great transformation moves subtly,
all things arise and proliferate,
as if by nature’s own doing—
unknown to those who act,
this is self-transformation.
What more is there to it?

When transformation stirs to action,
I shall govern it with the nameless Primordial.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Mencius said:
*"Those who wait for King Wen to rise before acting
are merely common folk."*
People follow their ruler—
when transformation stirs to action,
it departs from the Dao to seek goodness,
risks virtue to act,
and strays from nature to follow desire—
this is insufficient to stabilize the world.

Only the Dao, nameless and undifferentiated,
can restrain such stirrings.
Thus, the Sage saves the erring with loyalty.

**Explanatory Notes:**
The Sage always aids others,
never abandoning them—
those transformed by the Dao
all rise anew.

Thus Mencius said:
*"Those who wait for King Wen to rise before acting
are merely common folk."*
The noble’s virtue is like wind,
the commoner’s like grass—
grass bends with the wind,
so people follow their ruler.

The ruler’s transformation of the people
is like molten metal shaped by the caster,
or clay molded by the potter.

The violent and bold become compliant;
the perverse and self-serving become upright;
the arrogant and constrained become harmonized—
yet even this is not without some artificiality.

When transformation stirs to action,
it departs from the Dao to seek goodness—
the Dao’s completeness is impaired;
it risks virtue to act—
the virtue’s essence may falter.

The Dao has neither goodness nor non-goodness;
if one clings to goodness,
it becomes disjointed and severed.

The highest virtue is without virtue,
when virtue is perfected as action,
then it becomes difficult and perilous.

The Dao and virtue are both innate nature (*xìng*),
while goodness and action are the nature’s manifestation in the heart.
To depart from the Dao for goodness,
to risk virtue for action—
this is to abandon nature and follow the heart.

If one seeks to govern the world with the heart,
then heart-to-heart recognition is insufficient to govern the world.

Only the Dao, nameless and undifferentiated,
remains undispersed, thus the Sage abides in stillness.
Nameless and without substance,
it resides in the void of things—
only the Dao gathers the void,
the Great Primordial, nameless.

What is beneath form is called *qì* (instrumental),
the Dao transcends form and is not confined by *qì*,
thus it remains undifferentiated and undispersed.

The nameless Primordial is the complete essence of the Dao—
with this, the Sage abides, and who could suffer from deficiency or excess?

The nameless Primordial also does not desire.

**Emperor Xuanzong’s Annotation:**
The Master’s non-action lies in the slightest inclination of things;
ancient Daoist techniques reside here as well.

Though few can embody the fullness of Heaven and Earth,
the Master thus does not desire—
this is why Laozi dispels confusion and resolves delusion.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*"Clustering blocks, accumulating dust—*
though non-action may appear so,
it is not without principle.
Thus, the Master’s non-action still lies in the slightest inclination of things,
and ancient Daoist techniques reside here as well."

This reflects the debate between the two schools,
raised in inquiry to Master Taigong.

Nonetheless, the Dao is ever in non-action yet nothing remains undone,
Heaven and Earth act through non-action.
The nameless Primordial is like the Master’s non-action—
if one acts without action, few can embody Heaven and Earth’s perfection,
thus the Master does not desire.

Laozi dispels the obscurity of words
and resolves the later ages’ confusion—
is this not his insight?

With non-desire comes stillness,
and the world will naturally align itself.

**Emperor Xuanzong’s Annotation:**
*"Water still becomes level and balanced—
the great artisan takes this as his model."*

With non-desire in stillness,
one does not stray from correctness—
first, one corrects oneself,
thus the world will naturally align itself.

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"The Creative’s Dao is transformation and change,
each rectifying its nature and destiny."*

The Creative’s Dao manifests in transformation and change—
this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.
Each rectifying its nature and destiny—
this is non-desire in stillness,
and the world will naturally align itself.

To govern the world with the Dao,
until each rectifies its nature and destiny—
this is called governance at its utmost.

**Explanatory Notes:**
*"The noble observes great waters necessarily,
for the highest goodness resembles water,
nearly embodying the Dao."*

Water, though shifting in square, round, curve, and straight,
varies without constancy—
yet when still, it is level and balanced;
the great artisan takes this as his model—
*"The unmoved is level,"*
and *"The ruler’s measure must be balanced."*

The Dao’s essence is thus—
ancient worthies took water as their model.
Water still becomes level and balanced—
this is non-desire in stillness,
and the great artisan takes this as his model,
thus the world will naturally align itself.

With non-desire in stillness, it remains one and unchanging,
never straying from correctness.
Never straying from correctness while first correcting oneself—
this is correcting oneself so that things correct themselves,
thus the world will naturally align itself.

As Zhuangzi said:
*"Only the Sage can correct life to correct all lives,
only the Still can still all stillness—*
this is the same intent."

*The Classic of Changes* says:
*"The Creative’s Dao is transformation and change,
each rectifying its nature and destiny."*

Sudden, formless revolution is called *change*;
gradual, form-adapted transformation is called *change*.
The Creative’s Dao appears in transformation and change—
this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.
Preserving the form while safeguarding the spirit,
each has its measure—this is *nature*,
and continuity without interruption—this is *destiny*.
All things rectifying their nature and destiny—
this is non-desire in stillness,
and the world will naturally align itself.

This chapter begins with *"The Dao is ever in non-action yet nothing remains undone,"*
and ends with *"the world will naturally align itself."*
The effects of governance are complete and exhaustive—
nothing further can be added.
This is called governance at its utmost.

**End of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing*, Volume Seven.**

**#1** *"No contesting"*—this sentence likely has a missing passage.
**#2** *"Not straying from correctness"*—*"then"* (*zé*) may be a corruption of *"its"* (*qí*).

**Volume Eight of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing*,**
by Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy.

**Volume Eight of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing* (continued)**

Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Dao has no fixed form; virtue has completion and deficiency. Aligning with the Dao means there is no virtue to be named, while distinguishing from virtue means there is virtue to be discerned."* The *Ren-Yi-Li-Zhi* [仁義禮智], according to their measure, are received, and according to the times, they are applied—this is virtue alone. Those who embody the Dao differ from this, hence they are placed in the lower scriptures.

The *Explanatory Notes* state: *"Adaptability is the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed ways. The Dao beyond form is called the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed forms."* The Dao is present in all things: look upward and it is in the heights, look downward and it is in the depths, strive forward and it is in the front, cast aside and it is in the rear. It has no gate, no side path—its boundless radiance extends in all four directions. This is its formlessness. It can be yielding yet firm, soft yet hard, short yet long, round yet square; precious yet empty. Gazing upon it all day, one cannot see it—this is its formlessness.

If the Dao has no fixed form, how can there be completion and deficiency in virtue? If virtue has a fixed form, how can there not be completion and deficiency in it? Virtue has high and low; only by elevating it can one ascend to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient. Virtue has small and great; only by cultivating it can one progress to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient.

Zhuangzi said: *"When virtue is complete, this is called ‘establishment’*; thus virtue indeed has completion."* Again he said: *"The proper may be deficient*; thus virtue indeed has deficiency."* Viewed from their unity, it aligns with the Dao, with no virtue to be named—Yang Xiong’s *"unity is wholeness"*, Zhuangzi’s *"virtue encompasses the singularity of the Dao"*. Viewed from their distinction, it separates from virtue, with virtue to be discerned—Yang Xiong’s *"separation is dispersion"*, as the scripture says: *"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there is Ren and Yi"* [大道廢有仁義].

Ren is the proper conduct for humanity, applied as fitting; Li is the way to enact it; Zhi is the way to know it. The worthy discern its vastness, the unworthy attend to its minutiae. The benevolent see it and call it *Ren*, the wise see it and call it *Zhi*—each receives according to their measure, and applies it according to the times. This is virtue alone.

But the Dao is otherwise: it universally encompasses all without distinction, flows ceaselessly and fills all without lack, bestows benefits and achieves completion without ever exhausting itself. Who could speak of completion or deficiency in the Dao?

Those who embody the Dao differ from virtue in this way, hence virtue is placed in the lower scriptures.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: "The Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue"**
The upper virtue does not virtue, hence it has virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *"When things are granted life, this is called virtue. If all receive it equally, it is silently in accord with the Dao. When one transgresses, they do not repent; when one is appropriate, they do not feel self-satisfied—this is called ‘not virtue’."* When Confucius did not dwell upon his sainthood yet acted in the manner of the sage, this was his way of having virtue.

The *Explanatory Notes* state: *"Speaking of its origin, life is not virtue unless clarified. Speaking of its completion, life is the radiance of virtue."* All things within the realm of existence have life, and the reason they live is that they obtain the One. What is the One? Virtue nearly arises from it—Zhuangzi’s *"the One from which all things arise, the One yet unformed"*. When things are granted life, this is virtue. If nature is equal and virtue is shared, then all receive it equally. If virtue is in accord with the Dao, then it silently aligns with the Dao.

Only by knowing nature and reflecting upon virtue, when virtue reaches its initial state, does one move according to principle and act according to the times—this is transgression. Not transgressing by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—what is there to repent? When one is appropriate, it is not by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—thus one does not feel self-satisfied. The True Person’s virtue is such; this is called ‘not virtue’.

If otherwise, then reckless and wild behavior, stepping boldly upon the Great Square and moving without restraint, circulating within the central rites—this can be called upper virtue? In the past, Confucius, though endowed by Heaven with the potential for sainthood, when answering Gongxi Hua’s question, said: *"If it were about sainthood and virtue, how could I dare?"* When answering Zigong’s question, he said: *"Sainthood, I cannot achieve; I do not dwell upon my sainthood."* Yet when times were clear, he was clear; when times were demanding, he took responsibility; when times were harmonious, he was harmonious. Gathering the great achievements of the Three Sages, Mencius regarded this as the time of sainthood, and said: *"Since the birth of the people, there has been none like Master Kong."* His virtue is evident.

The lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *"Recognizing and possessing virtue, one is selfish and loses the Dao—what virtue remains?"*

The *Explanatory Notes* state: *"The Dao within me has never had a fixed form. If one claims possession of the Dao, the Dao will abandon you. Thus, recognizing and possessing virtue are all delusions."* Moreover, to cultivate oneself for private gain and to abandon private gain for the public good—this is what the Dao does for the public, yet to claim possession of the Dao is selfish. Only the selfless can achieve their private gain; how could selfishness not lose the Dao?

To desire not to lose virtue yet to lack virtue—what else is this but lower virtue?

**The Upper Virtue Acts Without Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**
Huizong’s annotation states: *"Without thought yet attaining, without effort yet accurate, without movement yet arriving—this is upper virtue."*

The *Explanatory Notes* state: *"One nature has awareness, piercing through the boundless—this is ‘without thought yet attaining’. Employing it without strain, naturally in accord with the Dao—this is ‘without effort yet accurate’. Never exerting force, yet nowhere does it fail to be preserved—this is ‘without movement yet arriving’. If such, then acting is non-acting, and non-acting emerges from acting. The peak of virtue cannot be surpassed—thus it is called upper virtue."*

**The Lower Virtue Acts With Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**
Huizong’s annotation states: *"Without thought, one does not attain; without effort, one is not accurate; without movement, one does not arrive—this is lower virtue."*

**The Virtue of High and Low—Thus the Sage and the Wise Are Distinguished**

Virtue has its high and low—is this not how the sage and the wise are divided?

To transcend the body and abandon wisdom, to attain the Great Unity—
Ren, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are to be simplified, yet cannot be discarded,
and so there is no need for them.
To bend and adjust ritual and music,
to sigh and lament over ren and righteousness,
to soothe the hearts of the people—
this is to gain what others gain,
yet not to possess it oneself,
and so there is need for them.

*The Explanatory Notes* state:
When sincerity illuminates, it is called the Dao.
When illumination returns to sincerity, it is called teaching.
To attain without thought, to hit without effort, to arrive without movement—
this is sincerity illuminating.
To think and thus attain, not to think and thus not attain;
to exert effort and thus hit, not to exert effort and thus miss;
to act and thus arrive, not to act and thus fail—
this is illumination returning to sincerity.
Sincerity illuminating is the work of the sage,
illumination returning to sincerity is the work of the wise.
Thus virtue has its high and low—
is this not how the sage and the wise are divided?

Unburdened by the body, unconstrained by wisdom,
yet transcending the body and abandoning wisdom—
the body cannot obstruct,
wisdom has its own penetration,
and thus one attains the Great Unity.
To forget ren and righteousness,
to forget ritual and music—
ren, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are to be simplified, yet cannot be discarded,
and yet there was never anything to begin with—
this is called *without need for them*—
this is upper virtue.

To make music soft and refined, to make ritual precise and orderly,
yet to bend and adjust ritual and music,
to make ren pliant and righteousness compliant,
to sigh and lament over ren and righteousness—
to use these to soothe the hearts of the people,
sufficient only to unsettle the hearts of the people—
this is to gain what others gain,
yet not to possess it oneself—
this is called *with need for them*—
this is lower virtue.

**Upper Ren Acts Yet Has No Need for Action**
Huizong’s annotation states:
*"The sage is born with it—
seven times he covered the world, yet did not seek personal gain,
and so there is no need for it."*

*The Explanatory Notes* state:
Zhuangzi said: *"Great ren is not ren."*
What is called "not ren" is not without ren—
it is able to ren yet does not use ren as ren.
Thus there is *easy ren* and *utilitarian ren*.
Easy ren follows naturally without need for action,
utilitarian ren uses ren for gain and acts accordingly.
Mencius said: *"The sage is born with it."*
Easy ren is not the same as acting in ren.
Thus ren covers the world without exclusion—
this is called upper ren.
Zhuangzi spoke of the sage resting in what is at ease,
not resting in what is not at ease,
and the *Book of Documents* praised Emperor Yao’s virtue as *"tranquil and tranquil"*—
this is upper ren acting yet having no need for action.

**Upper Righteousness Acts Yet Has Need for Action**
Huizong’s annotation states:
*"To array enemies and measure suitability—this is righteousness,
to establish oneself and govern affairs—how can one avoid action?"*

*The Explanatory Notes* state:
Righteousness in discernment is arraying enemies,
righteousness in adaptation is measuring suitability—
Yang Xiong’s *"arraying enemies and measuring suitability"* refers to this.
Mencius said: *"If a person can fill the space between ‘you’ and ‘I’ with righteousness,
then righteousness cannot be exhausted in its application."*
Thus righteousness certainly establishes oneself.
Yuzi said: *"To respond to change with righteousness,
then righteousness certainly governs affairs."*
Because it establishes oneself, the *Explanation of Characters* says: *"Righteousness is ‘I.’"*
Because it governs affairs, the *Book of Documents* says: *"To govern affairs with righteousness."*
To establish oneself yet not forget oneself,
to govern affairs yet not abandon affairs—
all these involve action,
and is this not upper righteousness acting yet having need for action?

The *Book of Songs* speaks of *"the wildfowl and cranes coming to the ancestral hall"*—
yet follows with *"blessings and prosperity come with them"*—
those who come are welcomed because of their righteousness.

**Upper Ritual Acts Yet Finds No Response**
Huizong’s annotation states:
*"Ritual is for exchanging with others,
for demonstrating to people,
for regulating and adorning ren and righteousness—
its uses are many.
If no one initiates giving and returning,
and giving is exhausted yet no one responds,
then resentment and contention arise,
and disorderly changes emerge.
In the Spring and Autumn period,
a single unanswered word,
a single unreciprocated bow—
two states would fight to the bones over it,
and yet this was still to restrain the lesser disorder.
The sage is thick in ren yet thin in righteousness,
and ritual is merely what is trodden upon, not what is dwelled in.
Thus upper ren aligns with virtue,
upper righteousness has need for action,
upper ritual finds no response."*

*The Explanatory Notes* state:
To distinguish is to use arms,
to exchange is to use the *dou* vessel—
ritual’s use with guests and hosts is when the *dou* is employed—
thus ritual is for exchanging with others.
Ascending and descending, circling and bowing—
ritual’s presence in ceremony is an external performance—
thus ritual is for demonstrating to people.
The way to establish a person is through ren and righteousness—
ren’s substance lies in filial piety,
righteousness’s substance lies in following elders—
ritual’s substance is to regulate and adorn these two—
thus ritual regulates and adorns ren and righteousness.
The *Rites* number three hundred,
the *Analects on Ritual* number three thousand—
from solemn rites to joyous rites,
from rites for heavenly spirits to rites for human ghosts—
its uses are many.
In summary, it is about giving and returning first—
the *Records* say: *"The highest virtue values virtue,
the next values giving and returning."*
Yet ritual values reciprocity—
to give without returning,
to return without giving—
all are unritual.
When giving is exhausted yet no one responds,
then resentment and contention arise—
this is inevitable.
In the Spring and Autumn period,
a single unanswered word,
a single unreciprocated bow—
two states would fight to the bones over it—
this was because action was met with no response.
Thus to restrain the lesser disorder by rolling up one’s sleeves and persisting.
The sage knew this—
what is close yet cannot be too broadly applied is ren,
so virtue cannot be too thick in ren.
What is distant yet cannot be too narrowly occupied is righteousness,
so the Dao cannot be too thin in righteousness.
As for ritual—
to depart and not linger,
to pass and not dwell—
it is merely what is trodden upon, not what is dwelled in.

Thus it is that the proper footwear for advancing—
the ritual of what is trodden upon—
is so because it is lowly yet what all tread upon,
and thus ritual is what is walked upon, not dwelled in.

The *Yijing* takes heaven above and marsh below as "trodden upon,"
and says, "Trodden upon, yet not dwelled in"—
this is why it is so.

The ancient Perfect Ones did not know where ritual would lead,
yet they forgot themselves in the Dao and its arts—
this is because of this.

Thus, supreme virtue aligns with power yet does nothing,
supreme righteousness has something to establish itself upon,
supreme ritual has those who do not respond to it—
yet it cannot escape its burdens.

Therefore, one loses the Dao and then attains virtue,
loses virtue and then attains ren,
loses ren and then attains righteousness,
loses righteousness and then attains ritual.

Ritual, then, is the thinning of loyalty and trust—
and the origin of chaos.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The Dao cannot be attained, so one loses the Dao and then attains virtue.
Virtue cannot be hoarded, so one loses virtue and then attains ren.
Ren can be cultivated, and when cultivated, it approaches righteousness—
so one loses ren and then attains righteousness.
Righteousness can be diminished, and when diminished, it is adorned with ritual—
so one loses righteousness and then attains ritual.

As for ritual, the farther it strays from the Dao, the more it loses.
All things do not flourish simultaneously—
this is yin and yang.
They take from one another—
this is威 (awe) and德 (virtue).
Where substance is thick, appearance is thin—
this is the ritual of father and son.

Thus observed, the more elaborate the ritual,
the more surely substance decays.
When substance decays, deceit follows,
and contention and chaos arise—
hence, ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,
and the origin of chaos.

**Explanation of Meaning:**
The Dao is ever without action, thus without form—
without form, it is not "that."
Hence, it cannot be attained.
Yet the Dao is the revered foundation of virtue—
so one loses the Dao and then attains virtue.
Virtue, once obtained, is within oneself—
within oneself, there is nothing external—
hence, it cannot be hoarded.
Yet virtue encompasses all that can be done as ren—
so one loses virtue and then attains ren.
Virtue is without action, but ren carries the heart of love and benefit—
thus ren can be cultivated.
Yet when cultivated, it approaches righteousness—
so one loses ren and then attains righteousness.
Righteousness, when thick in substance, must be set in proper measure—
thus it can be diminished.
When diminished, it is adorned with ritual—
so one loses righteousness and then attains ritual.

From losing the Dao to ritual,
each descent is lower,
the farther from the Dao,
the more is lost.
For action brings deceit,
non-action brings truth—
thus their difference is so great.

Non-action, then, is the root of all things,
and the reason virtue is supreme—
this is so.

Moreover, the ebb and flow never cease,
kings rise and fall in succession,
things do not flourish simultaneously—
this is yin and yang.
When yang prevails, yin withdraws in listening,
when yin prevails, yang hides in concealment.
What is diminished here must overflow there—
this is awe and virtue.
To govern with virtue, awe is not the priority;
to rule with awe, virtue comes afterward—
this is the natural order, unchangeable.

Thus, the ritual of father and son,
though thin in appearance, is thick in substance—
as Zhuangzi said:
*"Dressing like a market peddler’s feet,
he excuses himself with fright,
his brother with a nurse’s voice,
and with great respect for his elders—*
this is the meaning.

Thus observed, elaborate ritual decays in substance—
like a tree not yet flourishing, its root must already be weak.
When substance decays, deceit follows,
and contention and chaos arise—
how then could it be substantial yet unknown as loyal?
How could it be proper yet unknown as trustworthy?

Given how ritual fosters deceit in this way,
one must abandon the false and take the true,
and extinguish it.

The *Records* say that loyal and trustworthy persons can learn ritual—
this is because it values its root.

**Premature Knowledge** is the flower of the Dao,
and the beginning of folly.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
The Dao descends and manifests,
manifests and gives rise to wisdom.
Wisdom, when used as a chisel,
sharpened and applied,
wears out the spirit and recklessly measures—
this is premature knowledge.
Premature knowledge follows superficiality and forgets the root—
thus it is the flower of the Dao.
The heart labors, and wisdom grows more constrained—
thus it is the beginning of folly.
Though it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.

**Explanation of Meaning:**
Ren, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—
none are outside virtue.
The Dao descends and manifests,
manifests and gives rise to wisdom.
Though wisdom branches from the Dao,
it is still rooted in the Dao.
Yet what Confucius despised in wisdom
was its inability to act without interference—
this is using wisdom as a chisel.
How much more so when probing the nature of things,
sharpening its grasp,
wearing out the spirit in shallow depths,
recklessly measuring—
this is premature knowledge,
the flower of the Dao, not its substance.
Though it may seem plausible, it is not so.
For minor knowledge harms virtue,
lost knowledge harms the Dao—
but premature knowledge,
boasting cleverness and skill,
already follows superficiality and forgets the root,
not knowing to nourish the source of wisdom
while frugally expending it—
though it has not yet reached harming virtue or the Dao,
it is still not the true Dao.

If so, then deceit arises,
the heart labors daily, growing more clumsy,
and wisdom is constrained—
this is the nature of premature knowledge,
and why it is the beginning of folly.
Though it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.

Confucius said:
*"Do not anticipate deceit,
do not recklessly measure the untrustworthy."*
Yet this was the foresight of the virtuous—
how much more so the wise?

Thus, the superior person dwells in substance, not in superficiality,
resides in truth, not in its adornment—
and so abandons the false to take the true.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
What is "there" is what the Dao rejects.
What is "here" is what the Dao upholds.
What the Dao upholds is thick, not thin,
substantial, not superficial—
unless one’s wisdom is sufficient to know oneself,
returning to one’s original nature
without drifting into the habits of things—
who could do this?

The *Yijing* says:
*"Thickly restore, without regret—
self-examination in the center."*
Thick—this is the utmost of substance.
A person born with substance is nature itself.

To restore one’s nature is simply to dwell in substance—
this is how the superior person fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue.

**Exegesis:**
To feign with propriety or contrive with cleverness
are both distant from the Dao, belonging to "there."

The highest virtue acts without action yet lacks nothing,
the highest benevolence acts yet lacks nothing—
both are not far from the Dao, belonging to "here."

What belongs to "there" pursues trifles and forgets the root,
thus the Dao rejects it.
What belongs to "here" returns to substance and fortifies thinness,
strives for truth and abandons adornment,
thus the Dao upholds it.

What the Dao upholds is thick yet not thin,
substantial yet without adornment—
only those who see goodness clearly and wield firm resolve
can know themselves with sufficient wisdom,
refining their nature to return to virtue
without drifting into the habits of things.
Thus they abandon the falsehoods of contrived action
and take the truth of non-action.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Thickly restore, without regret—
self-examination in the center."*
Thick—this is the utmost of substance.
If we speak of *dunren* (thick benevolence),
it means benevolence is the utmost substance.
If we speak of *dunhua* (thick transformation),
it means transformation is the utmost substance.
Only when people are born with substance,
following nature’s shifts,
does one’s birth substance become the nature of Heaven.
If one truly restores this utmost substance,
all actions will lead to auspiciousness—
who would have cause for regret or blame?
This is the foundation of restoration,
explaining *"thickly restore, without regret."*
Unless wisdom suffices to know oneself,
one cannot attain this.
Thus the symbol speaks of self-examination in the center,
while Confucius said: *"Restore to know oneself."*
This is how the superior person fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue—
its foundation lies here.

**On the Chapter "The Ancient Who Obtained Oneness" (Thirty-Ninth):**
The ancient who obtained oneness—
Heaven obtained oneness and became clear,
Earth obtained oneness and became tranquil,
The spirit obtained oneness and became numinous,
The valley obtained oneness and became full,
All things obtained oneness and were born,
The sovereign obtained oneness and became the rectifier of the world—
this is the attainment of oneness.

**Huizong’s Annotation:**
Zhuangzi said: *"To penetrate to oneness is to complete all things."*
Attaining oneness means not being dual,
embracing oneness means not departing,
guarding oneness means not shifting.
To know oneness is to know all things;
not to know oneness is to know nothing.
The ancient who obtained oneness
embodied the utmost precision of the world—
nothing could pair with it.
Thus, firmly established above,
it was pure and unmixed;
precipitously grounded below,
it was still and unchanging.
In the most profound darkness, formless—
this is the spirit, which, obtaining oneness, does not grow dim.
In the utmost emptiness, responsive—
this is the valley, which, obtaining oneness, does not exhaust.
All things transform from essence into form,
thus obtaining oneness to be born.
The sovereign rules alone over the multitude,
thus obtaining oneness to rectify the world.
From Heaven and Earth down to the sovereign,
though high and low differ in station,
dark and bright vary in dispersion—
Heaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,
the sovereign’s rectification of the world
are not sought externally but attained through oneness alone.
Thus it is said: *"This is the attainment of oneness."*

**Exegesis:**
The Dao, obscure in non-being,
is hidden in the unformed oneness;
the Dao, descending into being,
is divided among the myriad differences.
Within the undifferentiated,
the unformed gives rise to the formed—
the Two Principles are thus established,
the myriad things thus dispersed.
In darkness, the spirit;
in brightness, humanity—
all converge in oneness.
What is this oneness?
It is the number of essence.
All things within the realm,
governed by fixed numbers,
do not originate outside this oneness.
The *Great Correlation*’s number is fifty,
its use forty-nine—
one must always leave one empty.
The Nine Categories begin with the Five Phases,
yet the Five Phases must be one—
saying *"water is one"* means
it originates from the beginning of fixed numbers,
and thus one can act through the myriad.
The Six Wings and Four Openings—
its operation is nowhere absent.
Zhuangzi said: *"To penetrate to oneness is to complete all things."*
Is this not that virtue encompasses the Dao’s oneness?
To obtain this oneness and align with it,
to extend it in action—
its use is boundless.
Spirit and essence arise from the Dao,
form originates from essence—
when a person is born,
spirit gathers with essence, the likeness is complete,
and essence remains whole, not borrowed from without.
If oneness flows into artifice,
true essence is swiftly lost.
To associate with others is to obstruct the heart.
If one wishes to preserve one’s form without disturbing one’s essence,
what path leads to this?
It lies in attaining oneness to focus upon it,
embracing oneness to preserve it,
guarding oneness to solidify it—
then form is whole, essence is restored,
and one becomes one with Heaven.
Essence and spirit merge and do not separate.

The *Yijing* speaks of attaining oneness:
*"To attain oneness is to concentrate one’s will—
thus not dual."*
The Classic says: *"To embrace oneness, can one not depart?"*
To embrace oneness is to hold fast without slipping—
thus not departing.
Zhuangzi said: *"I guard my oneness to dwell in harmony."*
To guard oneness is to remain still and focused—
thus not shifting.
To know these three is to obtain oneness.
Yet obtaining it is not difficult;
to know that oneness is difficult.
To know oneness is to know all things—
this is *"the few obtain it."*
Not to know oneness is to pair with it—
all remain within oneness.
Thus the *Qian* (Creative) Dao seems difficult,
firmly established above yet ever easy—
easy, yet pure and unmixed.
The *Yijing* on *Qian* says: *"Strong, healthy, central, pure, precise"—
is this not Heaven obtaining oneness to become clear?*
The *Kun* (Receptive) Dao seems complex,
precipitous yet ever simple—
simple, yet still and unchanging.
The *Yijing* on *Kun* says: *"Utterly still, virtue complete"—
is this not Earth obtaining oneness to become tranquil?
The unfathomable, the unrecognizable—
this is the spirit.
Though the spirit is most profound,
calamity and fortune follow their kinds most clearly—
this is because obtaining oneness does not lead to dimness.

「Not to grasp nor to resist—
the most void yet ever responsive—
this is the *Gu* (Valley).

The *Gu* is utterly void,
yet its vast and subtle echoes answer without distinction—
this is because obtaining oneness brings forth boundless resonance.

Heaven and Earth receive the *Qian* (Creative) essence to become *Yin* and *Yang*,
*Yin* and *Yang* focus the essence to form the four seasons,
the four seasons disperse the essence to create myriad things,
and all things transform essence into form—
this is rooted in the *Gu* alone.
Thus, obtaining oneness brings forth life.

Only the void can respond to the real,
only stillness can govern movement,
only oneness can traverse all things.
Rulers and kings, who alone command the multitude,
embody this principle—
thus, obtaining oneness, they uphold the *Zheng* (Rectification) of the world.

From Heaven and Earth down to rulers and kings,
high and low occupy distinct positions,
dark and bright diverge in their forms—
these are the three *Ji* (Extremes).
Though each has its own established nature,
they share the functions of the three *Cai* (Talents),
yet remain distinct in their operations.

Trace their origins—
why Heaven is clear, why Earth is tranquil,
why rulers and kings uphold the *Zheng* (Rectification) of the world—
could they be separate from oneness?

This oneness,
founded in inherent stability,
harmonized with natural law,
resides within the utmost stillness,
where its essence is most true.
It is achieved through oneness alone—
no external pursuit is needed.
This is the *"Zhi Yi"* (Attaining Oneness),
is it not?

Heaven, without clarity, would fear collapse,
Earth, without tranquility, would fear eruption,
The spirit, without vitality, would fear exhaustion,
The *Gu* (Valley), without fullness, would fear depletion,
All things, without life, would fear annihilation,
Rulers and kings, without *Zheng* (Rectification) and noble virtue, would fear ruin.

The *Huizong* (Emperor Huizong) annotated:
Heaven’s duty is to nurture and cover,
Earth’s duty is to shape and bear.
If Heaven collapses, how can it cover?
If Earth erupts, how can it bear?

The spirit depends on humanity to manifest—
if it falters, there is no display.
The *Gu* (Valley) receives without hoarding—
if it is exhausted, none can respond.

When gathered, essence and *qi* become things—
life arises from obtaining oneness.
When dispersed, wandering spirits become transformations—
annihilation follows the loss of oneness.
Only through *Zheng* (Rectification) can one govern all changes,
constantly attaining oneness,
thus upholding all beings,
transcending and standing alone above all things—
its enduring and prominent influence is evident.

To seek nobility without peril,
this lies in the principle alone.

Hence, nobility roots in humility,
height begins with the lowly.

The *Huizong* annotated:
Humility is what nobility relies upon for stability,
the lowly is what height originates from.

Common folk see only the superficial,
while sages discern the foundation.
Common folk observe only the accomplished,
while sages perceive the subtle beginnings—
thus they always attain oneness.

The *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:
Nobility and humility have fixed roles,
height and low have defined positions—
these are immutable distinctions.

Yet nobility must root in humility,
for humility is what nobility depends upon for stability—
the lowly among the people are the source of its foundation.
Height must begin with the lowly,
for the lowly are what height arises from—
the humble origins of the *Tai* (Altar) and *Lai* (Sacrificial Platform) are the basis for establishing *Taiping* (Great Peace).

Examine the principles of things,
and none defy this pattern—
how much more so in human affairs?

Common folk chase fleeting trends,
yet the farther they stray from the Dao,
the more they see only the superficial.

Sages discern the foundation,
embodying the Dao’s void,
free from arrogance and excess.

Clinging to past traces,
they fail to grasp where true insight lies—
thus they see only the accomplished.

Sages perceive the subtle,
penetrating its essence,
untainted by boastful words—
thus they always attain oneness,
even amid ten thousand changes, remaining unharmed.

The *Shijing* (Classic of Poetry) sings of *Tianbao* (Heaven’s Protection),
meaning rulers know how to humble themselves,
thus completing their governance,
and ministers return praise to their superiors—
this too is nobility rooted in humility,
height founded in the lowly.
This is why the foundation endures without limit.

Examine the end of its composition,
and one sees sages ruling by the Dao,
guiding the times—
preventing fullness from reaching excess and failing,
elevation from peaking and then declining,
completion from crumbling,
and flourishing from decaying,
thus preserving the world’s order.

Therefore, rulers and kings call themselves *"Gu Gua Bu Gu"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)—
is this not their humility as foundation?
Is it not?

The *Huizong* annotated:
*"Gu Gua Bu Gu"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)
are names of humility,
yet rulers and kings use them as titles—
knowing their roots alone.

Thus rulers and kings bear noble virtue without peril—
is this not through this principle?

The *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:
Rulers and kings alone command the multitude,
so their comprehensive governance is universal.
Their virtue nurtures the world,
and their administration is thoroughly benevolent.
Their titles reflect unique distinctions,
yet they use *"Gu Gua Bu Gu"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)—
the names of humility—
to embody their modest, yielding, and self-effacing nature,
not claiming authority for themselves.
Could this be done by those who do not know the foundation?

Duke Zeng said:
*"Cōngmíng shèngzhì"* (Wisdom and sagely insight),
they guard with *"yú"* (foolishness);」

「Their achievements benefit the land,
yet they preserve them with humility.
These are all the Dao of the sage’s modesty—
only rulers and kings know to govern themselves thus,
and so they endure noble virtue for ten thousand generations without losing it.
Is it not true that humility is not the root of evil?

Thus they attain many praises yet no true praise.
The *Huizong* (Emperor Gaozong) notes:
*"If one elevates oneself to overcome others,
if one claims nobility to degrade others,
if one is strong yet does not know to yield with gentleness,
if one is bright yet does not know to temper with darkness—
seeking praise from the world while their governance earns frequent commendation—
then exaggerated praise will gather swiftly,
and baseless slander will follow soon after,
and thus they earn no true praise."*

The *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:
*"Not by others’ lowliness do we raise ourselves,
then will people gladly exalt us;
Not by others’ degradation do we claim our nobility,
then will people honor and revere us.
To elevate oneself to overcome others—
this is artificial pride, what use is there in such elevation?
To claim nobility by degrading others—
this is leveraging power, what use is there in such nobility?
Gentleness overcomes rigidity—
this is the natural order;
rigidity yet unaware of yielding to gentleness—
this is knowing only extension, not knowing retreat.
Brightness without blinding—
this is the Dao’s return;
brightness yet unaware of tempering with darkness—
this is knowing only display, not knowing subtlety.
With this, they boast of the world’s flaws,
though it may suffice to sell their name and earn frequent commendation,
it is merely a violation of the Dao to provoke it.
If so, then unearned praise will gather swiftly,
and baseless slander will follow soon after—
how could they escape Mencius’ scorn?
Seeking praise like this—
then their reputation floats above true merit, what difference does it make?
When the channels are full, their drying can be awaited,
and praise will soon be followed by blame—
how can it endure long?
To call this *no true praise*—
is this not fitting?

They do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,
nor *rugged like stone*.
The *Huizong* notes:
*"Jade is noble, stone is base,
yet both are fixed and unchanging."*

The sage rides the times and follows nature,
unhindered in their course,
with all change yet the heart ever steady—
this is the true attainment of *Oneness*.
Thus they cannot be fixed as noble or base.
Mencius said:
*"What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,
is that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.*
They do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,
nor *rugged like stone*—
only the sage who knows the transformations can reach this,
and this is called *Supreme Virtue*."*

The *Shuyi* say:
*"Virtue has essence and function,
with all change contained within it.
Wondrously observing its essence—
all myriad things can be gathered into Oneness;
broadly observing its function—
with Oneness, all myriad things can be enacted.
Adjusting and responding to it—
no action is unfit,
flowing through the mechanisms of emergence and return,
circulating in the uses of transformation—
this is the true Oneness,
serene and alone in its existence.
How could it be like the *glittering jade* that is noble yet cannot be base,
or the *rugged stone* that is base yet cannot be noble,
bound to a fixed essence,
grasped yet unchanging?
The sage’s movement is like water,
skilled in timing yet never lost,
avoiding obstacles yet never blocked,
adapting to square and round, straight and bent—
responding to change without constancy,
how could there be any hindrance?
The deeper the inquiry, the farther the exploration,
though it encompasses myriad transformations,
it remains ever true to the One—
this is the true attainment of Oneness.
Thus they cannot be fixed as noble or base,
for Oneness knows no nobility or baseness.
Laozi, having clarified the meaning of Oneness,
further warned those who cling to one-sidedness,
lest they be blinded by a single perspective,
unable to encompass all and ignorant of ultimate truth—
rigid like jade and stone,
stuck and unyielding.
Thus he reiterated his teaching.
Mencius said: *‘What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,
is that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.’*
This is exactly his intent.
Thus they do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,
nor *rugged like stone*—
only the sage who is vast and transformative can reach this.
The *Yijing* says: *‘To exhaust the spirit and know the transformations,
this is the height of virtue.’*
The sage’s way of knowing the transformations—
is also through *non-action* and *non-inaction*,
and this is called *Supreme Virtue*."*

**Chapter 40: *Fǎn* (Return) of the *Yijing* (Changes)**
*The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement—
the *weak* is the Dao’s use.
All things under heaven are born of *having*,
and *having* is born of *non-having*.
The *Huizong* notes:
*"The principles of all under heaven—
movement and stillness interdepend,
strength and weakness complement each other.
The myriad things, each returning to their root,
then already past yet return again,
restoring to the utmost stillness.
Yet, when they are stirred and thus connect with all under heaven,
then movement is none other than myself,
and thus it is said: *‘The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement.’*
Gentleness overcomes rigidity,
weakness overcomes strength—
the Dao’s wondrous use lies here.
Zhuangzi said: *‘The accumulation of many small non-victories becomes a great victory,
only the sage can do this,’*
and thus it is said: *‘The *weak* is the Dao’s use.’*
The seasons’ course—
they gather and store in winter,
only to flourish and renew in spring.
Water’s nature is utmost gentleness,
yet in attacking rigidity and strength,
none can surpass it—
is this not what is meant?
Thus *having* and *non-having* generate each other,
like a cycle—
so *non-having* gives rise to movement,
and *having* reaches its limit and returns to *non-having*,
like the *Yin* and *Yang* of the *Yijing*’s *Xī* (The Last) hexagram,
yet they cannot be said to negate each other.
Those who are obscured by *non-action*,
drowned in *partial action*—
how could this be the Dao?"

The *Shuyi* say:
*"Movement arises from stillness established,
and all under heaven’s moving lines return to stillness;
strength arises from weakness accumulated,
and all under heaven’s strong lines must gather from weakness.
Thus movement and stillness interdepend,
strength and weakness complement each other—
this is the natural order.
The myriad things’ birth—
they flow in countless forms,
like the swift and the fleeting,
yet in their end,
they shed their superficiality and return to their true nature,
restoring to their dwelling place.
The myriad things, each returning to their root—
this is the order of nature.
Thus when they are already past,
they trend toward the path of movement’s emergence,
and when they return to their source,
they restore to the realm of utmost stillness.
Being able to settle and respond,
stirred yet naturally connecting with all under heaven,
while movement is none other than myself—
this is how *Return* establishes movement,
and thus it is said: *‘The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement.’*"*

The soft is the Dao’s strength—
thus soft overcomes hard.
The weak is the Dao’s power—
thus weak overcomes strength.
The soft and weak—
this is the Dao’s *wu* (non-being).
Non-being as a function—
thus the Dao’s function lies here.

Yet weakness is the Dao’s root,
and guarding the root means
self-mastery alone.
Thus without defeat,
one attains the Dao of constant victory.
As Zhuangzi said:
*"Accumulating countless small non-victories
becomes great victory."*
Only the Sage can do this—
precisely this is meant.
Thus it is said: *‘The weak is the Dao’s function.’*

The *Yijing* says:
*"Stopped yet yielding, movement never ceases—*
*is this not what is meant?"*

Observe the four seasons:
If winter’s enclosure is not firm,
spring’s growth will not flourish.
Thus one must withdraw and store in winter
before luxuriance blooms in spring.

Observe water’s nature:
It receives filth and grime,
yet abides in softness and weakness,
uncontending—
and none can surpass it in overcoming hardness.
How different is this?

Now, all things generate through form,
yet the formed cannot form
what forms it.
Falling into *you* (being),
the formed is called *wu* (non-being).
Non-being does not abolish being,
thus it manifests in the east and south;
things do not remain in being,
thus they bend toward the west and north in *wu*.
Being and non-being generate each other,
like a cycle—
so with non-being’s movement,
non-being generates being,
and being, reaching its limit,
must return to non-being.
Like east and west,
though their directions differ,
neither can be omitted.

Those drowned in the Dao’s stillness,
like Ji Zhen’s *"doing nothing,"*
or those blinded by the Dao’s movement,
like Jiezi’s *"sometimes acting,"*
are they truly the Dao?

**Chapter 41: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**

The superior person hears the Dao
and diligently practices it.

*Huizong’s Annotation:*
The scholar who aspires to the Dao—
the superior person, through sincere and unceasing effort,
accumulates strength over time.

*Exegesis:*
Tools and vessels are mere instruments;
thus neither the high nor low defy them.
The scholar is one whose talent reaches upward—
what is above form is called the Dao.
If his talent ascends, his aspiration toward the Dao is clear.
The so-called superior person
is one who excels as a scholar
and holds high his resolve.
Thus when he hears the Dao,
his devotion is unwavering,
his faith profound.
Daily he knows what he lacks,
and with unflagging effort, he acts—
beginning as a scholar,
ending as a Sage.
As Master Kong said:
*"True accumulation of strength over time."*
He dwells in ease,
guards with firmness,
studies as if never enough,
and only ceases with death.
Never does he wish to rest midday—
as the *Records* say:
*"The utmost sincerity never ceases."*
Like Yanzi, who heard the Dao
and never grew weary—
is this not *"diligently practicing it"*?

The mediocre person hears the Dao,
as if it exists, as if it does not.

*Huizong’s Annotation:*
The mediocre person harbors doubt,
and doubt divides his resolve.
Thus toward the Dao,
he is sometimes drawn,
sometimes repelled.

*Exegesis:*
Above the common man,
one may speak of the superior.
The mediocre person is not of superior wisdom,
so when he hears the Dao,
his heart is not steadfast.
He sees the Dao with doubt,
thus doubts arise.
His resolve is divided,
his spirit congealed.
The mediocre person cannot be taught the superior,
for his heart is not steadfast
and he harbors doubt.
Doubt obstructs him—
sometimes he clings,
sometimes he drifts.
His resolve is divided,
yet he cannot unite.
Like Zixia, who exited to see
the splendor of the world and took delight,
then entered to hear
the Master’s teaching and found joy—
is this not *"as if it exists, as if it does not"*?

The inferior person hears the Dao
and laughs—
not to laugh is not to grasp the Dao.

*Huizong’s Annotation:*
The inferior person lacks faith to uphold it,
and wisdom to comprehend it,
thus he laughs.
The Dao has no form, color, sound, or taste to grasp—
it is far removed
from what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth desire.
Zhuangzi said:
*"Great sounds do not enter the vulgar ear,
profound words do not dwell in the common heart."*

*Exegesis:*
Music and bait may halt travelers,
but the Dao, when spoken,
is as insipid as non-being.
The inferior person, lacking lofty vision,
aligns with the vulgar.
His convictions are unsteady,
his faith insufficient to guard.
His sight is narrow,
his wisdom inadequate to illuminate.
Thus he scorns the Dao as shameful
and laughs at it.
There is a boundary between them—
his perception is burdened by things,
not the Dao;
this one’s hearing unites with the Dao,
not things.
The Dao is not transmitted through form, color, sound, or taste—
it is far removed
from what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth desire.
The Dao and things are thus unequal,
bounded by this division.
Hence the shallow may laugh at it.
If the Dao were like things,
burdened by traces,
it could be cast to the masses’ desires—
then the Dao would be small.
Thus not to laugh is not to grasp the Dao.

Zhuangzi said:
*"Great sounds do not enter the vulgar ear,
profound words do not dwell in the common heart."*
When sound reaches subtlety,
few know its harmony;
when words reach subtlety,
few understand them.
The Dao, at its subtlest,
is like great sound and profound speech—
thus the scholar laughs at it.
The *Classic* says:
*"Few know me—
thus I am precious."*
The meaning is the same.

Thus the *Jianyan* says:
*"Illuminating the Dao is like darkness—"*

*Huizong’s Annotation:*
If the sun and moon
shine upon the earth,
this is illumination.
Yet their wisdom is vast yet unshown,
their light borrowed yet not dazzling—
thus it seems like darkness.

*Exegesis:*
The *Yijing* says:
*"The sun and moon push each other,
and illumination arises."*
Master Kong said:
*"In Heaven, none are brighter than the sun and moon."*
The sun shines by day,
the moon by night.
When they hang high in the sky
and illuminate the earth below,
this is illumination.
The Dao’s brilliance is easy to see,
yet it is demonstrated without secrecy—
like the sun and moon’s light upon the earth,
this is *"illuminating the Dao."*

The *Classic* further states:
*"Yet the essence of the Way is profound and unfathomable,
the ultimate of the Way is dim and silent.
Wisdom and strategy are not employed—
its boundless virtue emerges without sound,
as if lost yet still present,
borrowing its radiance yet not dazzling—
thus it seems like darkness.*

*The Way is smooth like simplicity—*
*Huizong’s Annotation:*
*"Though their paths differ, their destination is the same;
one principle governs a hundred deliberations."*

*Exegesis:*
*Smooth* means *easy*—easy is without peril.
*Smooth* also means *constant*—constant is without change.
If there is no peril and no change,
then the Way is singular indeed—
as the *Classic* says: *"The Great Way is most easy."*

Though the Way is singular,
yet all things arise from it,
all things move by it—
as if not singular yet truly singular.

For when threads combine in purity,
they become without distinction,
distinction leads to separation and non-unity.

The Way’s application, though split into myriad branches,
its return is the same;
though dispersed in myriad forms,
its essence is singular—
as the *Systematic Discourse* says:
*"Divergent paths yet the same return,
a hundred deliberations yet one principle."*

*Advancing the Way is like retreat—*
*Huizong’s Annotation:*
*"Yan Yuan used retreat as advancement,
Zhuangzi called it 'Sitting in Forgetting.'"*

*Exegesis:*
*To study is to exhaust principle—*
thus it is called *gain*.
*To cultivate the Way is to deplete the self—*
thus it is called *loss*.
To study and gain each day
is to regard advancement as retreat.
To cultivate the Way and lose each day
is to regard retreat as advancement.

The Master Kong praised Yanzi saying:
*"I see his advancement—
I have not yet seen his cessation."*
Thus Yanzi had already advanced in the Way.

Yet at first he forgot benevolence and righteousness,
then he forgot ritual and music,
and finally reached 'Sitting in Forgetting.'
From his own account,
it seemed like retreat—
yet abandoning form and discarding wisdom,
uniting with the Great Permeation,
this retreat was truly advancement.

Thus Yang Xiong said:
*"In ancient times, Yan Yuan used retreat as advancement—
few could match him,
and Zhuangzi praised his 'Sitting in Forgetting.'"*

*The highest virtue is like a valley—*
*Huizong’s Annotation:*
*"Empty yet responsive,
responsive yet inexhaustible,
empty yet receptive,
receptive yet not hoarding."*

*The Classic* says: *"To be the valley of all under Heaven,
constant virtue is sufficient."*

*Exegesis:*
Zhuangzi said: *"Virtue encompasses the Way."*
He also said: *"Virtue encompasses the Way’s singularity."*

The Way is neither in being nor in non-being,
neither being nor non-being—
only emptiness.
Virtue is likewise.

Thus like a valley’s emptiness yet responsiveness,
responsive yet inexhaustible—
as the *Book of Documents* says: *"If virtue is ample, the body is sufficient."*
Like a valley’s emptiness yet receptivity,
receptive yet not hoarding—
as Zhuangzi said: *"Virtue contains nothing it does not embrace."*

*The Classic* says: *"To be the valley of all under Heaven,
constant virtue is sufficient."*
Is this not so?

*The most brilliant is like humiliation—"*

「The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"To purify and remove all obscurity, one sees no flaw—this is the state of great brightness. To dwell where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"The Classic states: ‘Bright and clear, penetrating and insightful.’ Zhuangzi said: ‘With this, one clarifies the heart.’ Thus, great brightness is the Way’s manifestation as flawless. How could one not see any flaw without purifying and removing external attachments, without possessing? How could one not recognize the profound and subtle principles without gazing into the depths and silently knowing them? Only when one is flawless can they stand apart from the common yet not be opposed by it, be an eccentric yet not be excluded by others—like water, dwelling where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation. This is what Zhuangzi recorded of Laozi’s Dao/Way and techniques: ‘Know its brightness, preserve its humiliation.’*

*"Ample virtue appears insufficient—*
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Virtue is all-embracing yet does not consider itself excessive, hence it appears insufficient."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"The highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue; the lowest virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. When virtue reaches the point of embracing all without exclusion, it is indeed broad. Yet if one considers it as having excess, then it is not broad. Only when one does not consider it as having excess, does its embrace of all become truly boundless. Thus, it appears as insufficient.*

*"The Autumn Waters rise in season, yet the River Warden is pleased—*
*The Exegesis* says: *"The River Warden, though pleased, is mocked by those of great insight, for he does not know the vastness of the Eastern Sea, believing all beauty to be within himself. This is how one who lacks virtue is laughed at by the wise."*

*"Established virtue appears as theft—*
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Sage deliberates to act yet does not seek success. Though they act with deliberation, success is inevitable, yet this does not mean they seek it. Thus, their established virtue seems like theft, for they act without intent."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"The Sage’s engagement with the world is without contrivance. Only without contrivance can they act in matters of creation and enterprise, all arising from necessity—what Zhuangzi called ‘not compelled by necessity in affairs.’ Yet even emperors and kings achieve results without deliberate action. Though they deliberate to act, they do not aim for success, yet each action succeeds—this is their established virtue, seemingly like theft, for they act without intent.*

*"The *Analects* say: ‘If one does not abandon the old, the people will not be negligent.’ Negligence leads to superficiality and thinness, yet because they act without intent, it appears as theft.*

*"Pure essence seems like mud—*
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Should one not say: ‘Though polished, it does not gleam’? Though rubbed, it does not dull. Should one not say: ‘Though white, it is not stained’? Though dyed, it is not blackened."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"At first, cinnabar and mineral pigments are vivid, but over time, they fade—fading means change. The True Person’s application of the heart cuts off the root of benevolence yet does not wither it, enriches the source of wisdom yet restrains its expression. In their perception, there is no favoritism; in their hearing, no excess. Their *qi* is full yet without deficiency, finding their own fulfillment without relying on others. Though they distinguish themselves from things, they remain in true clarity while discerning illusion. Though they are stirred, they remain tranquil—this is what is meant by ‘Though polished, it does not gleam.’ Though rubbed, it does not dull.*

*"Immediate purity upon staining—*
*This is what is meant by ‘Though white, it is not blackened.’ Thus, it appears as mud.*

*"The Great Square has no corners—*
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Great Square is the square of the boundless. Though it has form, it does not sever, hence it has no corners."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"Yin perceives the Spirit’s presence in Yin yet not in Yang; Yang perceives the Spirit’s presence in Yang yet not in Yin. Yin and Yang are unfathomable, and the Spirit cannot be sought in any fixed form. Thus, in the realm of supreme clarity, at the origin of utmost Yang, entering the gate of profound obscurity, at the origin of utmost Yin—this is how the Way has form that can be pointed to. Though the Way has form that can be pointed to, it adapts flexibly to all things, leaving no trace of rigid distinction. It responds spontaneously without fixed patterns—this is the square of the boundless, differing from virtue that has corners. Hence, though it has form, it does not sever.*

*"The *Book of Odes* says: ‘Solemn and dignified, the bearing of virtue.’ Thus, virtue’s corners can be known. Zhuangzi said: ‘No gates, no sides—four-way openness, vast and boundless.’ Thus, the Way’s corners cannot be known. The great vessel takes time to mature—*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The great vessel is the vessel of the boundless. It neither adds to life nor aids in growth, hence it matures late."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"Where there is form, there is name; where there is division, there is limitation—this is the vessel. Yet there is a vessel that transcends form and enters awareness, creating shape while existing beyond measure, standing in the unfathomable, moving without trace, uniquely surpassing all images and precedents—this is the vessel of the boundless. The vessel of the boundless is the Way. The Way cannot be advanced abruptly, nor can one take it without following its natural progression. Hence, it matures late.*

*"Yang accumulates into heat, Yin accumulates into cold—*
*This is not achieved in a single day. Could it be that one adds to life to bring about auspiciousness, or plucks the millet to aid its growth? The great sound is rare in voice—*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"It moves without form, yet responds when touched—hence its voice is rare."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"The source of sound is evident, yet the sound itself has never been emitted—this is what is meant by ‘sound is the great sound.’ Though the blind musician Jian was to listen all night with his head bowed and ears straining, he would not hear its voice, hence it is called rare. Rare implies a broad yet questioning resonance, not something heard by the ears—this is what Zhuangzi meant by ‘moving without form.’ Though unheard, its clarity and turbidity, high and low, shouts and sighs, all respond when touched, and the five tones cannot but resound in their proper order—this is sound, and it is indeed great. The Classic says: ‘Listening yet not hearing is called rare.’"*

*The Huainanzi* says: *"There is no sound, yet the Five Tones resound within it. Is this not what is meant by the great sound that is rare in hearing?"*

*The Great Image is formless.*
Huizong’s annotation: *"It rests in the profound and obscure, yet when viewed, it cannot be seen—hence it is formless."*
*The Exegesis* says: *"That which shapes form is real, yet the shaping itself has never taken place—this is what is meant by the shaping that is the Great Image. Even if Li Zhu were to gaze at midday, wiping his eyes and raising his brows in expectation, he would not see its form, hence it is called the Great Image. For what is seen is called an image; yet when there is seeing, to say it is formless is to speak of the form that does not manifest. This is what Zhuangzi meant by dwelling in the profound and obscure. Though unseen, all things that have form arise from it—its role as an image is indeed great. The Classic says: ‘The image of the formless.’*
*The Huainanzi* says: *"There is no form, yet from it all forms arise. Is this not what is meant by the Great Image being formless?"*

*The Dao is hidden and nameless.*
Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.
Huizong’s annotation: *"From the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, all are the Dao. The subtlety of the Dao cannot be sought with intellect nor pursued with form—it is hidden, and yet one cannot make it clear."*

The Sage attains the Dao, thus giving without depletion, responding without exhaustion, and completing all things without claiming possession—merely resting therein. The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly. Thus, with diligent practice, one arrives at the formless and rests in the untransformed. The remaining matters suffice for imperial governance. *The Transmission* says: *"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage."*

*The Exegesis* says: *"The Dao is nowhere without being present, manifesting as essence when in essence, as function when in function—nameless and without substance, yet never separate from named and substantial things. Thus, from the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, though their names differ, all are the Dao. Yet the utmost subtlety of the Dao is profound and obscure—though not separate from named things, it cannot be sought with intellect. The utmost extremity of the Dao is hazy and silent—though not separate from material things, it cannot be pursued with form. It is indeed hidden. Though one may force a name upon it, the original source of the Dao resists naming, for the Dao is hidden and nameless."*

The Sage attains the Dao, using ultimate emptiness to govern all things and ultimate substance to move all things. Thus, the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one responds, the more one is fulfilled. As the foundation for all things and the reliance of transformation, the Sage rescues all without abandoning any, nurtures all without discarding any. When things come with sensation, the Sage aligns with them in natural harmony, yet never neglects; when things depart, the Sage rests with them in tranquility, yet never burdens. Those who dwell elsewhere take for themselves and receive, yet ultimately return to their origin. Those who dwell here achieve without taking, yet fundamentally incur no cost. All things—small or great—are completed in their proper measure, without claiming possession, simply resting therein.

The principles of the world: *"The departing will depart, yet ultimately return; the deceased will die, yet ultimately revive."* The Dao lends to things, ending where it begins, ceasing yet never ending—hence it is called *qiě* (thus). The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly—this lies in diligent practice alone.

If one truly accumulates strength over time, one arrives at the formless and merges with the Dao, resting in the untransformed and enduring through ages eternal. The remaining matters suffice for governing the state and rectifying the world—its surplus is ample for imperial achievements. What is within us is not merely sufficient but abundant.

This section begins with the Superior Person hearing the Dao and practicing diligently, concluding that the Dao lends and completes effortlessly. Thus, from lower learning to higher attainment, those who excel as scholars all follow this path. Even Master Gu said: *"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage."* This is what is meant.

*End of Volume Eight of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*
*Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*

**Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing (continued)**

*Chapter 42: Dao Gives Rise to One*

**Dao gives rise to One.**
Emperor Huizong’s annotation: At the beginning of all things, there is the indeterminate (無), which is nameless; this is where One originates.
The Exegesis states: There is the *Taiyi* (太易) and there is the *Tai’chu* (太初).
The *Taiyi* is the state before *qi* (氣) manifests.
The *Tai’chu* is the first emergence of *qi*.
When it is called the *Tai’chu*, it is because it lies within the realm of the indistinct and formless, when the Dao transforms into *qi*—at that moment, not yet a single thing exists. Vast and empty, it is but indeterminate (無) alone. Thus, before the *Tai’chu*, there was nothing at all—this is the origin of indeterminacy (有無).
As Zhuangzi said, *"indeterminacy"* is what is called *wu* (無), for indeed, there was nothing.
Once it is said to be *wu* (無), then it is *wu’ming* (無名)—nameless.
Moreover, Heaven has no fixed name for things; things arise and their names follow naturally. When their forms are complete and their numbers established, then their abundance or scarcity can be named.
In its state of *wu* (無), not yet a single thing exists, and not yet a single thing, then it is not something that can be sought through appearance, form, sound, or color. Who could name it?
The *Jing* (經) says, *"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,"* and again, *"The Dao is ever nameless."*
Thus, the nameless indeterminacy (有無) is the essence of the Dao. The Dao’s essence is fundamentally indeterminate (無), yet it never neglects the determinate (有). Therefore, when it moves, it does not generate indeterminacy (無) but generates the determinate (有), manifesting its signs. When it shifts from indeterminacy to determinacy, numbers begin to establish themselves. Thus, the origin of One is rooted in the *Tai’chu*—this is the Dao descending and emerging.
If the Dao remains indeterminate (無), then it returns to the undifferentiated (浑沦), when *qi* has not yet appeared, and One cannot be obtained. This is what is meant by *"At the beginning of all things, there is indeterminacy (有無), and indeterminacy is nameless (無名)."* This is where One originates—just as Liezi said, *"The easy transforms and becomes One."*

**One gives rise to Two.**
Emperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven is One, Earth is Two; water emerges, and fire follows; when the essence is complete, the spirit arises.
The Exegesis states: Heaven is noble, Earth is humble; *Yin* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) are thus defined, and so it is that there is Heaven and Earth, establishing differences between the high and low.
*Yin* (乾) is Heaven, its number is odd.
*Kun* (坤) is Earth, its number is paired.
Thus, the *Yijing* (易) refers to Heaven as One and Earth as Two. There is Heaven before there is Earth, and so Earth is Two following Heaven.
Water is deep and empty; it takes form through the solid, and distinction comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Kàn* (坎), which contains One. Hence, One is water.
Fire is restless and swift; it takes form through stillness, and unity comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Lí* (離), which encompasses Two. Hence, Two is fire.
From the Dao descending, water is nearly of the Dao, yet within water there is fire, succeeding in turn; thus, water is One, and fire is Two following it.
Heaven, One, gives rise to water, which in things is the *jing* (精).
Earth, Two, gives rise to fire, which in things is the *shen* (神).
Only the most refined essence in the world can become the most refined spirit in the world; thus, when a person is born, the *jing* (精) gathers the *shen* (神), and the body takes form.
The *jing* (精) is the foundation of the body; when the *jing* is complete, the *shen* reigns supreme. If one guards it and does not lose it, the *shen* and *jing* become one.
Therefore, one who does not depart from the *jing* is called a *shen’ren* (神人)—this is what is meant by *"when the essence is complete, the spirit arises."*

**Two gives rise to Three.**
Emperor Huizong’s annotation: One combines with speech to become Two; Two combines with One to become Three.
The Exegesis states: Numbers begin with One, are established in Two, and completed in Three.
One is odd; alone, it does not generate.
Two is paired; alone, it does not complete.
One odd and One paired, and yet Three arises.
When traced to its source, the Dao’s great origin is singular and without counterpart. Though myriad things exist, they are all of One with me.
Once it is called One, it cannot lack speech, so One is one thing, and speech is another thing—thus, One and speech become Two.
One is odd, Two is paired; odd and paired generate each other, so there is Two when there is Three—thus, Two and One become Three.
From indeterminacy to determinacy, until it reaches Three, it is then gathered to extend toward the infinite—this is the natural progression of numbers, which cannot be altered.

**Three gives rise to the myriad things.**
Emperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven marks One at the North, Earth marks Two at the South, and the human takes form in Three. When the Three Principles are complete, the myriad phenomena are divided.
The myriad things are called "ten thousand" (万) by number; from this point onward, they cannot be counted exhaustively.
The Exegesis states: Once the undifferentiated is divided, the light and pure gather upward to form the *yang* (陽), and its number is odd, so Heaven marks One at the North.
The heavy and turbid descend and congeal to form the *yin* (陰), and its number is paired, so Earth marks Two at the South.
Yet Heaven governs the original *qi*, and Earth governs the original form; there must be one who governs the original awareness.
Heaven’s role is to give birth and cover; Earth’s role is to bear and load; there must be one who takes charge of teaching and transforming.
Thus, Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the human takes form within them.
When the Three Principles are complete, those rooted in Heaven belong to the high and associate upward—Heaven is clear and disperses.
Those rooted in Earth belong to the low and associate downward—Earth is turbid and gathers.
The distinct clustering and separation of kinds, the varied states of flight, movement, plants, and growth—
all arise in their ordered ranks, and the myriad phenomena are divided.
Count all the myriad things in the world, and none do not arise from this; hence, the *Yijing* says, *"Heaven and Earth exist, and then the myriad things are born."*
From Three, the myriad things arise; from this point onward, even the most skilled cannot count them exhaustively.
Yet the myriad things are called "ten thousand" (万) because their multitude is named and spoken of—
how could one enumerate their teeming, tangled confusion? Can it be exhausted?

**The myriad things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*, and the harmonizing *qi* unites them.**
Emperor Huizong’s annotation: *Yin* is still and quiet; the myriad things bear it, hence the Superior Person says, *"Enter and rest."*
*Yang* is fluid and accomplished; the myriad things embrace it, hence the Sage says, *"Face the bright and govern."*
There must be the balance between *yin* and *yang*, and this is the harmonizing *qi*.

Zhuangzi says: *"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave.*
*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, while *resplendent* arises from Earth. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born."

**Exegesis says:** The luminous function of Heaven, manifesting all things, is called *yang*; the obscure, formless, and unfathomable is called *yin*. *Yang* moves and emits, while *yin* remains still and contracts, hence *yin* is still and quiet. *Yang* warms and flourishes, while *yin* congeals and restrains, hence *yang* is fluid and accomplished.

Since *yin* is still and quiet, the myriad things that follow in its wake—all that is born—bear *yin* and face north. Since *yang* is fluid and accomplished, the myriad things that precede it—all that is born—embrace *yang* and turn south.

Because the myriad things bear *yin*, the Superior Person follows the principle of *yin*, hence he retires at dusk to rest, for night is the peak of *yin*—as the *Yijing* says: *"The Superior Person, at the approach of evening, enters to rest in repose."* Because the myriad things embrace *yang*, the Sage faces the bright and governs, for day is the peak of *yang*—as the *Analects* say: *"With reverence and rectitude, he faces south."*

Without *yin* and *yang*, there would be no harmonizing *qi*. The harmonizing *qi* takes Heaven’s One as its root and Heaven’s Five as its pivot. Without the harmonizing *qi*, there would be no supreme harmony—harmony that does not lean toward *yang* nor cling to *yin*, but remains in the balance of *yin* and *yang*.

Zhuangzi says: *"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave."* Indeed, *yang* is bright while *yin* is obscure; *resplendent* ascends to the heights of supreme luminosity, the origin of the utmost *yang*; *yang* gives birth while *yin* destroys—*solemn and grave* enters the gates of profound darkness, the origin of the utmost *yin*.

*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, and Heaven’s *qi* descends; *resplendent* arises from Earth, and Earth’s *qi* ascends. Heaven and Earth intermingle in vaporous transformation, and the myriad things refine into purity. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born.

Yang Xiong also said: *"Heaven and Earth interact, and the myriad things are born."*

What people detest—being solitary, orphaned, and impoverished—is what kings and lords take as their title.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** Things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.

Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness, proceed together without losing harmony—this is the way of the Sage alone. Thus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. When things reach their extreme, they return; when they are full, they diminish—this is how one remains above without peril.

**Exegesis says:** When things ascend to their peak, they descend; hence the high are brought low. When things reach their fullness, they decline; hence the abundant are diminished. Whether refined into *yin* and *yang* or dispersed as affairs and things, none escape this law: things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.

The Sage delves into origins and knows subtleties, thus he consumes when it is time to consume, rests when it is time to rest. He follows the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, preserves the great harmony, and moves with the times without deviation. Hence, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are names of lowly things, he takes them as his title without shame.

For the trends of the world, extremes must necessarily decline, but he guards his attainment without loss, knowing when to return at the peak. Though fullness must inevitably overflow, he holds his abundance without excess, knowing when to diminish at the point of saturation. Thus does he long endure in wealth and nobility, remaining above without peril?

Therefore, things may be diminished to benefit, or benefited to diminish. **Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When trees shed their leaves, their roots are fertilized—thus, diminution brings benefit. When the moon is full, it must be eclipsed—thus, addition brings diminution. Heaven and Earth follow the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness; how much more so for humanity?

Thus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. Though it seems self-diminishing, it is the way to achieve benefit and maintain noble elevation.

What people teach is also what I teach. The overbearing and violent do not meet a good end. I shall make them my teaching father.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** To subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity—this is what people teach. What I teach is different.

The overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention; thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning, hence I shall make them my teaching father.

**Exegesis says:** In terms of affairs, the weak cannot resist the strong, nor can the gentle overcome the rigid—thus, to subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity, is what people teach.

In terms of the *Dao*, rigidity and strength dwell below, while gentleness and weakness dwell above—indeed, the gentle can overcome the rigid. If so, then my teaching is certainly different from that of others.

Though my teaching differs from others’, what others teach is also my principle—only that what others teach pertains to affairs, while my teaching pertains to the *Dao*. Yet in using strength and weakness as lessons, they are one.

For the rigid and strong are doomed to perish, while the overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention—thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning: *"The wicked serve as a resource for the virtuous. When one sees the wicked, one must solemnly reflect upon oneself."*

「Is this not the very principle of my teaching? *Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Gentleness of the World*

The supreme gentleness of the world can conquer the supreme rigidity of the world.

The *Huizong* annotation states: *"The rigid will be destroyed, the sharp will be blunted. Only the Sage can accumulate the small to achieve the great victory."*

The *Shuyi* commentary explains: *"The world has ways of constant victory and constant defeat. The way of constant victory lies in gentleness, while the way of constant defeat lies in rigidity.*

Indeed, the way of constant victory lies in gentleness—this is why the ancient *Dao*’s true and magnanimous masters must embody meekness and humility as their outward expression.

To manifest as meek and humble, they root themselves in depth, having no need for rigidity, for rigidity invites destruction. They adhere to restraint, having no need for sharpness, for sharpness invites blunting. Thus, they do not engage with rigidity or sharpness, so others always take the lead, while they alone take the rear. Others always grasp what is solid, while they alone embrace what is empty. They yield to the overbearing and follow the winding paths of others, conforming to the flow of things like water in waves. In their emptiness and stillness, they never falter—this is what is meant by the supreme gentleness of the world.

When it comes to governing all things and directing myriad movements, responding to the boundless, and drawing upon resources without depletion, turning the heavens and earth yet no one perceives its vigor, subduing the realm yet no one attributes it to force—this is also the supreme gentleness of the world, unstoppable in its conquest.

Zhuang Zhou’s discussion of accumulating small advantages to achieve great victory—only the Sage can do this—truly demonstrates profound insight into this principle.

Observe the wind as it moves through the boundless void: it points at me and I conquer it; it adds to me and I conquer it. When it comes to stirring and swaying all things, none dare resist its command. Water, dwelling in gentleness, flows east when guided eastward, flows west when guided westward. Yet when it attacks rigidity and strength, none can precede it—this too exemplifies the idea of accumulating small to achieve great victory. Who would say the supreme gentleness of the world cannot conquer the supreme rigidity of the world?

There is no entering the boundless void.

The *Huizong* annotation states: *"In the *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters*, it discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the eyes of the *Mu* target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart. The foot’s movement is limited by distance, the eye’s sight by subtlety, but only the spirit is boundless in its reach."*

*"In the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox."*

*"Ding* is the yin aspect of fire and the manifestation of the spirit. Thus, his blade moves with ease, as if playing without effort."*

If so, then to enter the boundless void—is this not the domain of one who exhausts the formless and wanders without trace? Who else could grasp this?

The *Shuyi* commentary explains: *"When things are constrained by form and *qi*, they are always limited by these very things. The *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes are each vulnerable in their own way, yet none can perceive the subtle, hidden movements of the great transformation, which unfolds silently in the depths, without action yet naturally so. They are enslaved by the craft of creation, yet cannot escape their inherent flaws or excesses.*

The *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters* thus discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart—all are constrained by their own limitations.

The foot’s movement is confined by near and far, its strength by reach; the eye’s gaze is limited by fine and coarse, its clarity by scope. But the spirit is profound and formless, its operations boundless—swift yet not hasty, reaching yet not forced. Its uses are wondrous, its transmission without limit, yet it never stagnates in form or body.

The spirit’s boundlessness is but emptiness itself. Through emptiness, it finds utility in both entering and exiting—thus, it is without limit and cannot be contained. Is this not precisely what is meant by having no entry into the boundless void?

In the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox. All things arise through their forms, yet the spirit governs them. The butcher’s task is to harmonize, thus nurturing life.

The earth gives birth to fire, which in humans becomes the spirit. *Ding*, the yin aspect of fire, is the manifestation of the spirit.

When the spirit is employed, the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox is realized. And when one encounters things with the spirit rather than the eye, halting the senses while the spirit acts freely—then the mind illuminates itself, and all *Dao*’s principles are attained. He splits great joints, guides great cavities, yet never falters, his blade moving with effortless grace. The ox is dismembered with ease, its pieces falling apart as if by themselves.

Even the metaphor of the butcher’s blade—though thin and entering gaps—can still meet resistance. But what of one who has no form entering the boundless void? Then, the six orifices and four limbs are fully open, clear and penetrating, with no obstruction or hindrance at all. Only one who exhausts the formless, attains boundlessness, and leaves no trace of the *Dao* could achieve this.

Thus, one understands the benefits of *wuwei*—non-action.

The *Huizong* annotation states: *"The gentleness overcomes rigidity, the void encompasses the having, and the wondrous uses of the *Dao* truly lie here. Abandoning action spares the body’s labor, neglecting life preserves the essence’s integrity—this is why it is beneficial."*

The *Shuyi* commentary explains: *"The *Dao* is ever in non-action yet never fails to act. Non-action is the true, still essence of the *Dao*, unmoving in its nature. Never failing to act is the wondrous operation of the *Dao*, responding to all things without effort.

Only in its non-action yet never failing to act does the *Dao* achieve victory through gentleness, and encompass the having through the void. Its wondrous uses truly lie here.

Gentleness overcoming rigidity—this is what is meant by accumulating in gentleness to achieve rigidity. The void encompassing the having—this is what is meant by non-action generating the void, and the void giving birth to the having.

Its uses are thus wondrous—how could one delight in forced action and labor? The operations of the *Dao* are measured and harmonious, emerging and responding as needed. Though myriad transformations arise, the principle of non-action remains unchanged.

If non-action is embraced, what need is there to abandon action? Why should one labor in vain?」

**生奚足遗？**
Why should life be abandoned?

**弃事则形不劳而全，遗生则精不亏而复。**
To abandon worldly affairs preserves the body unwearied and whole, while to abandon life exhausts the vital essence and leaves it depleted.

**形全精复，与天为一，则其有益孰大於是？**
When the body is whole and the essence restored, one aligns with the Heavenly Way—what greater benefit could there be?

**不言之教，无为之益，天下希及之矣。**
The teaching of non-speech, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain to these.

**徽宗注曰：**
*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*
**不言之教，设之以神；**
The teaching of non-speech is established through the numinous.

**无为之益，不亏其真。**
The benefit of non-action does not diminish its authenticity.

**圣人以此抱朴而天下宾，无为而万物化，故及之者希。**
The Sage embraces simplicity and thus the world comes as guest; through non-action, all things transform—few attain to this.

**疏义曰：**
*Explanatory commentary:*
**言有当愆，孰若不言之教？**
When words falter, what surpasses the teaching of non-speech?

**妙通心术而设之以神，《易》所谓以神道设教，而天下服者，此也。**
To subtly penetrate the mind’s workings and establish it through the numinous—this is what the *Yijing* means by teaching through the Way of the numinous, thereby winning the world’s submission.

**为有成亏，孰若无为之益？**
Action brings completion and loss—what surpasses the benefit of non-action?

**得於自然而不亏其真，庄子所谓无益损乎其真者，此也。**
To gain from spontaneity without diminishing authenticity—this is what Zhuangzi meant by not harming one’s true nature.

**盖天地有大美而不言，则知不言之教固神矣。**
Heaven and Earth possess supreme beauty yet speak not—thus the teaching of non-speech is indeed numinous.

**天地以无为而清宁，则知无为之益固真矣。**
Heaven and Earth achieve tranquility through non-action—thus the benefit of non-action is indeed authentic.

**圣人以天地为宗，故以此抱朴而天下宾，无为而万物化。**
The Sage takes Heaven and Earth as model, thus embracing simplicity and welcoming the world, acting in non-action while all things transform.

**朴者，道之全体，惟道能总摄群有，所谓守小朴而物自宾也。**
Simplicity is the complete essence of the *Dao*; only the *Dao* can encompass all things—this is what is meant by preserving the small simplicity and letting things come as guests.

**无为者，道之自然，惟道能干旋化枢，所谓我无为而民自化也。**
Non-action is the *Dao*’s spontaneity; only the *Dao* can pivot and transform the world—this is what is meant by my non-action while the people spontaneously transform.

**然则不言之教，无为之益，非体无尽道者不能知此。**
Thus, the teaching of non-speech and the benefit of non-action—only those who embody the boundless *Dao* can comprehend these.

**圣人者道之极，故天下希及之。**

*The Sage is the pinnacle of the Dao—few in the world attain to this.*

**名与身章第四十四**

**名与身孰亲？**
Between name and body, which is closer?

**身与货孰多？**
Between body and wealth, which is greater?

**徽宗注曰：**
*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*
**两臂重於天下，则名与身孰亲？**
If two arms weigh heavier than the world, then between name and body, which is closer?

**生者岂特隋珠之重哉，则身与货孰多？**
If life is not merely as precious as the Duke of Sui’s pearl, then between body and wealth, which is greater?

**至愿在我，名非所亲也；**
When ultimate desire resides within, name is not what is cherished.

**至富在我，货非所多也。**
When ultimate abundance resides within, wealth is not what is excessive.

**惟不知亲疏多寡之辨，而残生损性，以身为徇，若伯夷死名于首阳之下，盗跖死利于东陵之上，岂不惑哉。**
Only those who fail to discern closeness, distance, abundance, or scarcity will harm life and diminish nature, sacrificing the body for name—as Bo Yi starved to death for reputation beneath Chief Yang’s slopes, or Zhi the Robber died for gain at Dongling’s heights—how bewildered they are!

**达生之情，而不务生之所无以为，此有道者之所以异乎俗也。**
To understand life’s essence and not pursue what life cannot provide—this is how the Daoist differs from the common.

**疏义曰：**
*Explanatory commentary:*
**务内观者取足於身，诚其身者真乐内融，则一身之中，众美咸具，何往而不自适。**
Those who cultivate inner observation find sufficiency in the body; those who sincerely embody it experience true joy within—thus within one body, all virtues are complete, and where could one not find self-contentment?

**世之昧者，不能定乎内外之分，辨乎真伪之归，乃矜搅外务，见得忘形，汲汲於名，以危其身，殊不知两臂重於天下，身亦重於两臂，名与身孰亲？**
The ignorant of the world cannot distinguish between inner and outer, nor discern true from false—thus they boast of external affairs, seeing gain while forgetting the body, eagerly pursuing name and endangering themselves. How could they know that two arms weigh heavier than the world, and the body heavier than two arms? Between name and body, which is closer?

**孳孳为利，以害其生，殊不知生固重於隋侯之珠，利固轻於千仞之雀，身与货孰多？**
Striving ceaselessly for profit harms life—how could they know that life is heavier than the Duke of Sui’s pearl, and profit lighter than a thousand *ren* sparrow? Between body and wealth, which is greater?

**惟不介意於傥来而以守身为本，然后能自适其性分，以道为重矣。**
Only by not fixating on transient gains and taking body-preservation as foundation can one naturally align with one’s nature and hold the *Dao* as paramount.

**列御寇居郑圃四十年，人无识者，未闻其干於名。**
Lie Yukou dwelled in Zheng’s fields for forty years; no one recognized him, nor did he seek fame.

**颜回乐箪瓢陋巷，人不堪其忧，未闻其累於货。**
Yan Hui took joy in a gourd and bowl in a humble lane; though others could not endure his poverty, he was never burdened by wealth.

**所重者，道而已。**
What they valued was the *Dao* alone.

**是以至愿名誉并焉，至富国财并焉。**
Thus, ultimate desire encompasses both name and reputation, while ultimate abundance encompasses both state and wealth.

**至愿在我，则不急於人知，名非所亲也。**
When ultimate desire resides within, one is not hasty for others’ recognition—name is not what is cherished.

**至富在我，则万物皆备，货非所多也。**
When ultimate abundance resides within, all things are complete—wealth is not what is excessive.

**於此而不能明亲疏多寡之辨，其为智亦疏矣。**
To fail to discern closeness, distance, abundance, or scarcity here—such wisdom is indeed coarse.

**故有见生於可欲，乃残生伤性，以身为徇而忘其真，如伯夷见名之可欲，饿于首阳之下是也，盗跖见利之可欲，暴于束陵之上是也，此皆昧於至理，惑而不能解也。**
Thus, when life is seen as desirable, one harms life and injures nature, sacrificing the body while forgetting its true essence—as Bo Yi, seeing name as desirable, starved beneath Chief Yang’s slopes, or Zhi the Robber, seeing profit as desirable, perished at Shulei’s heights. These are all ignorant of ultimate truth, bewildered and unable to awaken.

**惟达生之情，不务生之所无以为。**
Only by understanding life’s essence and not pursuing what life cannot provide—

**生之所无以为者，非生之所待而生也，此有道者所以能保身全生而异於世俗者欤？**
What life cannot provide is not what sustains life—this is how the Daoist preserves the body and ensures life while differing from the common.

**得与亡孰病？**
Between gain and loss, which is more harmful?

**徽宗注曰：**
*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*
**烈士徇名，食夫徇利，其所得者，名与货，而其亡也，乃无名之朴，不赀之躯，病孰甚焉？**
The heroic sacrifice name, the gluttonous sacrifice profit—what they gain is name and wealth, yet what they lose is nameless simplicity and a body without treasure. Which is more harmful?

**疏义曰：**
*Explanatory commentary:*
**求诸性分之内者，有益於得；**
To seek within one’s nature’s scope benefits gain;

**求诸性分之外者，无益於得。**
To seek beyond one’s nature’s scope benefits gain not.

**有益於得，则其得也裕然而有余；**
When gain is beneficial, its acquisition is abundant and overflowing;

**无益於得，则其得也歉然常不足。**
When gain is unbeneficial, its acquisition is meager and always insufficient.

**夫惟不足，故烈士徇名，则累於名高而不知名公器也，不可多取。**
It is because of insufficiency that the heroic sacrifice name, burdened by high reputation, fail to recognize that name is a public instrument, not to be hoarded.

**黄夫徇利，则累於利厚而不知货恶其弃於地也，不必为己。**
The gluttonous sacrifice profit, burdened by excessive gain, fail to recognize that wealth is detestable when abandoned on the ground, not to be hoarded for oneself.

**盖万物之理相为消长，有得则亡或继之，故诸所病。**
For the principles of all things involve mutual growth and decline—gain is often followed by loss, hence the afflictions.

**然其得之也，是岂真得之哉？**
Yet what they gain—is this truly gain?

**名与货皆傥来之寄耳，寄之其来不可图，其去不可止。**
Name and wealth are but transient lodgings—when they come, one cannot foresee them; when they depart, one cannot stop them.

**而其亡也，乃至於损德塞性，苦身疾作，丧无名之朴而失其至真，忘不赀之躯而舍其至贵，则其病大矣。**
Yet what they lose is to damage virtue and obstruct nature, toil the body and hasten illness, to abandon nameless simplicity and lose its utmost authenticity, to forget the priceless body and forsake its utmost worth—then their affliction is great indeed.

**是故甚爱必大费，多藏必厚亡。**
Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure, and excessive hoarding brings great loss.

「黄夫慕外，则累於利而忘其真；徇物过度，则损德而失其至。 无慕於外，则心固而不费；无累於物，则性全而不失。

**徽宗注曰：无慕於外，则啬而不费。**
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Without coveting the external, one becomes frugal yet unspent.

**无累於物，则守而不失。**
Without being burdened by things, one preserves yet does not lose.

**取予之相权，积散之相代，其至可必，若循环然，岂可长久。**
The interplay of taking and giving, of accumulation and dispersal, is certain in its unfolding—like the cycles of nature, how can it endure long?

**疏义曰：重内而不重外，然后能无慕於外；**
*The Explanatory Commentary:* To value the inner while not the outer—only then can one avoid coveting the external;

**见性而不见物，然后能无累於物。**
To perceive nature while not seeing things—only then can one avoid being burdened by them.

**不生外慕，则无多欲之逐，故啬而不费，非至於甚爱必大费者也。**
Without external craving, there is no pursuit of excessive desires, hence frugality yet no waste—this is not the case where extreme love brings great expenditure.

**不为物累，则无食积之忧，故守而不失，非至於多藏必厚亡者也。**
Without being burdened by things, there is no anxiety from overindulgence, hence preservation yet no loss—this is not the case where excessive hoarding brings great ruin.

**虽然利之在天下，民咸用之，无所不通，有取斯有予，其出入常相权，有积斯有散，其盈虚常相代，乃必至之理。**
Though benefit pervades the world, all people employ it, and it flows everywhere—there is taking, then there is giving; its ebb and flow are ever balanced, its fullness and emptiness ever alternate—this is the inevitable Dao.

**势若循环之不能自已，又乌可恃为长久而认为己有哉？**
Its momentum is like the unceasing cycles of nature—how then can one arrogantly claim it as one’s own enduring possession?

**虽执之使留，且自冥冥中去矣，惜夫世俗莫之悟。**
Though one clings to it to make it stay, it departs from the unseen depths—alas, the common folk do not comprehend this.

**经曰：金玉满堂，莫之能守。**
*The Classic says:* Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them.

**知足不辱，**
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,

**徽宗注曰：处乎不淫之度，何辱之有？**
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* To abide in the measure of non-excess, what disgrace can there be?

**疏义曰：一性之真，万善充足，道之尊，德之贵，莫之爵而常自然。**
*The Explanatory Commentary:* The singular truth of nature suffuses all virtues—its Dao is exalted, its virtue/power noble, yet it requires no titles and remains ever spontaneous.

**不假势物而无所歉，则亦处乎不淫之度而已。**
Without relying on external things, lacking nothing, one simply abides in the measure of non-excess.

**盖不淫之度者，不皦不昧，适与之当而不过也。**
For the measure of non-excess is neither excessive nor deficient—it harmonizes with the appropriate and does not overstep.

**以此安其性命之情，则真君高世，良贵在我。**
By this, one settles the sentiments of life and nature—then the True Sovereign transcends the world, and true nobility resides within oneself.

**所以为义荣者，物无以尚之，又何辱之有哉？**
Thus, what is deemed honorable in virtue is beyond comparison with worldly things—what disgrace can there be?

**知止不殆，**
Knowing cessation brings no peril,

**徽宗注曰：游乎万物之所终始，故无危殆之患。**
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* To wander in the ultimate origins and endings of all things—thus, no peril of danger befalls.

**疏义曰：域於流动之机者，一息不停。**
*The Explanatory Commentary:* Bound within the mechanism of flux, it never ceases for a moment.

**固有默使之者，若有机缄而不得已，其运转而不能自止。**
There is an unseen force that governs it—like hidden springs that cannot be restrained, its motion turns yet cannot be halted.

**虽行之於无止，而不知有真止者。**
Though it moves without end, one does not know of true cessation.

**存势物之徒，不能徐观一性，镒渊静不迁之宗，乃与物为偶，相刃相靡，**
Those who cling to transient things cannot leisurely observe the singular nature—*the Dao of the boundless depths, tranquil and unchanging*—instead, they align with things, clashing and eroding like blades.

**其行尽如驰而莫之能止，且将菁然痕役而不知其所归，岂不危其身耶？**
Their actions rush like galloping steeds, unable to be stopped, yet they labor in vain and do not know their end—does this not peril their very being?

**真人则不然，超然独立乎形器之上，与造物者进，与无终始者为友，**
*The True Person* is otherwise—transcending and standing alone above form and matter, advancing with the Creator, consorting with the Eternal.

**盖将造乎不形而止乎无所化，故能游乎万物之所终始，虚静之中默与道会，**
For they craft the formless and cease at the unchanging—thus, they wander in the ultimate origins and endings of all things, and in emptiness and tranquility, silently converge with the Dao.

**其天守全，其神无却，物无自入而莫之能伤，又何危殆之患哉？**
Their natural defenses are intact, their spirit unobstructed—things cannot intrude of their own accord, nor cause harm—what peril of danger can there be?

**老氏於道常无名亦曰知止所以不殆，盖非通乎物之所造者，不能与此。**
*Master Laozi* speaks of the Dao as ever nameless, yet also calls it knowing cessation so as not to perish—only those who penetrate the mechanisms of things can align with this.

**可以长久。**
Thus, it can endure eternally.

**徽宗注曰：物有聚散，性无古今，世之人以物易性，故好名而徇利，**
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Things gather and disperse, yet nature knows no past or future—the people of the world mistake things for nature, hence they pursue fame and yield to profit,

**名辱而身危。**
Fame brings disgrace, and the body faces peril.

**圣人尽性而足，天下至大也，而不以害其生，故可以长久而与天地并。**
The Sage fulfills nature and finds sufficiency—this is the utmost greatness under heaven—yet does not harm their life, thus they can endure eternally alongside Heaven and Earth.

**疏义曰：即理以观物，则无常之分，有积有做。**
*The Explanatory Commentary:* To perceive things through the Dao of transformation, one sees their impermanent nature—there is accumulation, then there is dispersal.

**即妙以观性，则真常湛专，无古无今。**
To perceive nature through its subtlety, one beholds its eternal truth—unmoved, undivided, without past or future.

**以性逐物则性与物俱驰，以性辨物则物无自而入。**
To chase things with nature is for nature and things to rush together; to discern things through nature is for things to have no power to intrude.

**世之人昧於至理，驰其形性，港之万物，以易所固有，**
The people of the world are blind to ultimate truth—they exhaust their form and nature, ensnared by all things, replacing what they inherently possess,

**於是好名者困於志，徇利者忘其真，**
Thus, those who love fame are ensnared by ambition, and those who yield to profit forget their true essence,

**至於名辱而罔觉，身危而莫顾，交战於利害之域，何可长也。**
To the point where fame brings disgrace yet they remain unaware, their body faces peril yet they do not heed—engaged in battle within the realm of profit and harm, how can they endure long?

**圣人尽性而足，故能贵爱其身，不以害其生，**
The Sage fulfills nature and finds sufficiency, hence they cherish and esteem their body, not harming their life—

**三万岁而一成纯，与天地相为长久。**
Three ten-thousands of years pass in perfect unity, enduring alongside Heaven and Earth.

**大成若缺，其用不弊。**
*Great Completion, though seemingly incomplete*—its application is without exhaustion.

**徽宗注曰：域中有四大，道居一焉。**
*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Within the realm are the Four Great Elements, yet the Dao dwells in unity among them.

**体道之全，故可洛於大。**
To embody the Dao in its entirety—thus, one can dwell in the great.

**无成与亏，是谓大成。**
Without completion or deficiency, this is called *Great Completion*.

**不有其成，故若缺。**
Without its outward completion, it seems incomplete.

**知化合变，而不以故自持，故其用不弊。**
To know the transformations of change yet not cling rigidly to any fixed form—thus, its application is without depletion.

**此孔子所以集大成而为圣之时。**
This is how Confucius gathered *Great Completion* and became Sage.

**疏义曰：道未始有封，强为之名曰大。**
*The Explanatory Commentary:* The Dao has never been confined—yet it is named the "Great" by convention.

**既谓之大，则未离方体，寓於域中，而居四大之一焉。**
Though called "Great," it remains within the square and round, dwelling in the realm as one of the Four Great Elements.

**盖道覆载万物者也，天无不覆，地无不载，**
For the Dao is the one that encompasses and nurtures all things—Heaven covers nothing it does not, Earth bears nothing it does not,

**圣人位乎两间，体道之全以配天地，故皆名於大。**
The Sage stands between Heaven and Earth, embodying the Dao fully to harmonize with them—thus, they are named the "Great."

**则其由是道以出应天下，**
Then, through this Dao, they emerge to respond to the world,

**天造地设，发越显着，以彰制作之妙，其成也可谓大矣。**
Heaven and Earth crafting, their expression surpassing and manifest—thus, their completion can be called *Great*.

**然而道无成亏，乌至而倪小大？**
Yet the Dao knows no completion or deficiency—how can one measure it as small or great?

**世之人徒知圣人以道之绪余土直致天下之大利，**
The people of the world merely know that the Sage employs the remnants of the Dao to directly achieve the world’s greatest benefits,

**成天下之大顺，丰功茂烈，巍乎其成，**
Completing the world’s grand harmony, with abundant achievements and towering accomplishments—majestic in their completion,

**而不知道之妙用，本於精神心术之微。**
Yet they do not perceive the Dao’s subtle applications, rooted in the essence of spirit and the refinement of heart-mind.

**果且有成与亏乎哉？**
Does it truly have completion or deficiency?

**果且无成与亏乎哉？**
Does it truly lack completion and deficiency?

**惟其无成与亏，所以谓之大成。」**
Only because it lacks completion and deficiency is it called *Great Completion*.

The principles of all things reach their peak and then decay—
when deeds are accomplished, they return in cycles;
when names are attained, they incur loss.
Only by not clinging to completion can one achieve it without decay.

Thus, the divine person has no deeds—
not because they lack deeds, but because they do not dwell on them when accomplished;
the Sage has no name—
not because they lack a name, but because they do not rely on it when attained.
By abandoning deeds and names and returning them to the common people,
they are called *as if incomplete*.

*Great Completion* is *as if incomplete*—
not only does it not cling to its own completion,
but it also reveals its understanding of transformation and adaptation,
without rigidly adhering to the old ways.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"Those who know the Dao of transformation—
do they not know the workings of the numinous?"*

The numinous has no fixed form—
without fixed form, it transforms and nurtures to exhaust its changes,
and through change, it harmonizes to exhaust its benefits.
How could it be bound by the old and constant,
unable to adapt to the ebb and flow?

Thus, its use is inexhaustible.

Confucius gathered the essence of *clearing, harmonizing, and fulfilling*—
the very moment of his sagehood—
and this is why he attained it.

To *gather completion* is to strike like metal and resonate like jade—
to strike like metal is to begin with order;
to resonate like jade is to perfect that order.

The three Sages’ established ways—
this is what is meant by *resonating like jade*.
To hold fast to one principle without change
is only to achieve its end.

But when one strikes like metal and resonates like jade,
it is because they understand transformation and adaptation—
thus able to complete both beginning and end.
Hence, it is said: *Great indeed is Confucius.*

*Great fullness is as if empty*—
its use is boundless.

The *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:
*"Filling all without limit, suffusing all existence—
this is great fullness.
Empty to respond to things, void yet applied—
thus its giving never ceases, its use is boundless.
A wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,
and great virtue appears as if simple."*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The true essence of the Dao encompasses the six extremes,
vast yet containing all things without trace.
The subtle applications of the Dao flow through the six voids,
broad yet reaching everywhere without obstruction.
The Sage, attaining the Dao’s completeness,
fills all without limit, covering all things unseen,
suffusing all existence, animating the masses—
yet those who seek it find it inexhaustible,
its fullness so profound it cannot be measured.
Yet if fullness cannot yield to emptiness,
it cannot respond to things.
Only by the Dao’s emptiness meeting all things
can one apply it like a deep spring, flowing as needed.

Thus, filling it does not overflow,
drawing from it does not deplete,
giving it does not exhaust—
the more one gives to others, the more one possesses;
the more one shares, the more one has.
Its use is boundless—
hence, *great fullness is as if empty*.

Though it has accumulation, it is insufficient.
Though it has no hoarding, it overflows.
The perfected one has no accumulation—
only emptiness—
thus those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.

A wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,
great virtue appears as if simple—
this is why Laozi spoke thus to Confucius.

To have as if not having,
to be real as if empty—
this is the scholar’s ultimate endeavor,
just as the wise merchant hides his wealth.

*Great whiteness is as if stained*,
great virtue appears insufficient—
here lies the Sage’s emptiness and the gentleman’s demeanor.

From this, one can infer:
*Great fullness is as if empty*.

*Great straightness is as if bent*—
The *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:
*"Following things’ transformations, yielding and winding,
not forcing one’s will—
thus it appears bent."*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The Sage empties themselves to move through the world,
adapting to every situation—
nowhere does this fail to be straight,
for it follows things’ transformations.
Thus, winding yet unharmed,
curving yet unerring,
yielding to strength, following turns—
never rigidly self-assertive.
Though winding and turning,
its alignment is beyond control—
this is *great straightness*, appearing bent.

It is said, *not forcing one’s will*—
this is the meaning, is it not?

Zhuangzi in *Human World* says:
*'The inwardly straight align with Heaven,
the outwardly curved align with humanity.'*
For the world of humanity is to respond to others.
If inwardly aligned with humanity,
one cannot stand apart—
thus, outwardly curved—
and *great straightness is as if bent* becomes clear.*

*Great skill is as if clumsy*—
The *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:
*"Shaping things’ forms—
round, square, curved, straight—
their artistry unseen,
thus it appears clumsy."*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The Sage’s ultimate emptiness fulfills all demands,
yet their skill is hidden—
like Nature shaping forms without effort.
Thus, round and square yet bound by compass and square,
curved and straight yet never straying from the plumb line—
forms manifest, colors shine,
yet no trace of the true master remains.
Though round, square, curved, or straight,
each exhausts its art—
yet *great skill* is beyond measure.
It is said, *their artistry unseen*—
this is the meaning, is it not?

Zhuangzi in *Great Master* says:
*'Treading Heaven and Earth,
carving all forms—
yet not considered skilled.'*
For the *Great Master* is the source of all things.
Since all things take their source,
they give birth without possession—
thus, not considered skilled—
and *great skill is as if clumsy* becomes clear.*

*Great eloquence is as if inarticulate*—
The *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:
*"Speech without words—
this is called great eloquence.
Hui Shi’s many arguments—
his skill is small indeed."*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"Utmost speech transcends speech,
achieved through forgetting speech—
then one attains speech’s perfection.
The demand is for *eloquence without words*—
is this not the meaning of ultimate speech?

Zhuangzi says:
*'Great eloquence does not utter a single word.'"*

「Indeed, only by not speaking does one achieve *great eloquence*.
The Sage does not take *skill in argument* as true ability;
deeply cultivating the silent understanding,
where ultimate truth is preserved,
one illuminates without words,
requiring no aid from mere vocal sounds—
thus, it seems *as if clumsy*.
Hui Shi’s many arguments
are but the narrow confines of a skilled debater,
branching and convoluted yet failing to grasp the essence—
how could they ever speak of the *extreme*?
His *Dao* is flawed, and his words never harmonize;
he contradicts without purity,
yet claims his eloquence is vast—
his labor is no greater than a gnat’s or a horsefly’s,
so his *eloquence is small indeed*.
Who knows the *eloquence without words*?

*Agitation overcomes cold*,
*tranquility overcomes heat*,
yet *serene stillness* is the true rectitude for all under Heaven.

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"Yang’s movement brings agitation,
thus it overcomes cold.
Yin’s restraint brings tranquility,
thus it overcomes heat.
Both extremes lean toward Yang or Yin,
yet neither aligns with the *Middle*—
one is already ensnared by things,
already embroiled in strife with movement—
how could they ever rectify all under Heaven?
Only by abandoning agitation that overcomes cold,
and tranquility that overcomes heat,
does one remain untainted and clear—
embracing the *Spirit* in stillness,
then all under Heaven will naturally find rectitude.
The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"All things bear Yin yet embrace Yang,
and the *intermingling qi* harmonizes them.
Humans receive the *central qi* of Heaven and Earth,
and inherit the *intermingling qi* of their balance.
When one moves, agitation arises—
it issues from Yang,
and its heat is like blazing fire,
thus it overcomes cold.
When one ceases, stillness arises—
it settles in Yin,
and its cold is like frozen ice,
thus it overcomes heat.
Since both extremes suffer from Yang or Yin’s afflictions,
one clings to Yang in joy,
and to Yin in anger,
yet neither finds satisfaction in the *Middle*—
this is not the *Dao* of *‘moving yet all in accord’*.
If so, one is already ensnared by things,
sinking into the realm of chaotic flux,
already embroiled in strife with movement—
waging war in the paths of gain and loss,
where Yang and Yin become bandits,
and thus cannot rectify all under Heaven.
Only by abandoning agitation that overcomes cold,
and ensuring Yang does not disperse,
and tranquility that overcomes heat,
and ensuring Yin does not grow dense,
can one achieve *serene stillness* as the true rectitude for all under Heaven.
For *untainted clarity* is the utmost of *‘pure and serene’*,
as in *‘how clear it is’*!
To *embrace the Spirit* in stillness
is the utmost of *‘serene stillness’*,
as in *‘motionless and tranquil’*!
If one must be tranquil and clear,
then the *form* is upright and its *shadow* must be straight—
all under Heaven will not *await* rectitude,
yet rectitude will naturally arise.
Laozi, speaking of the *Dao*’s *non-action*, also says:
*‘By not desiring, one attains tranquility,
then all under Heaven will naturally find rectitude.’*
To call this *non-action*,
it is but *‘dull and unadorned’*—
seeking agitation that overcomes cold,
or tranquility that overcomes heat,
there is none indeed.

**Chapter 46: The Way of the World**

When the *Dao/Way* prevails in the world,
warhorses are turned back to manure the fields.

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"Those who govern the world with the *Dao*
let the people each take joy in their occupations,
with no strife—
they merely manure their fields.
The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"When the *Dao* is practiced in the world,
the people do not *corrupt* their nature;
when the world is *nurtured* with the *Dao*,
the people do not *shift* their virtue.
If the people do not *corrupt* their nature,
and do not *shift* their virtue,
then they till the soil and eat,
weave and wear,
hold their infants to their chests and play,
pound their bellies and wander—
each takes joy in their occupation,
with no boasting or coveting of others’ desires.
They but exert themselves in their roots,
toil in the southern fields,
and manure their plots—
even if they possess swift horses that chase the wind or lightning,
they will turn them back and not use them—
only those who know the *Dao* of the world can understand this.

When the *Dao* does not prevail in the world,
warhorses are born in the suburbs.

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"The strong oppress the weak,
the many tyrannize the few—
even borders cannot be upheld."

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"How can humans gather in groups? By *division*.
How can *division* be implemented? By *righteousness*.
*Righteousness* with *division* brings harmony,
and harmony brings unity.
Groups without *division* lead to strife,
and strife brings chaos.
The strong rely on force,
sometimes even oppressing the weak.
The many rely on numbers,
sometimes even tyrannizing the few.
They fight over land,
killing until the fields are filled—
warhorses are born in the suburbs,
and borders cannot be upheld—
this is because they do not know
to govern the world with the *Dao*."

No greater crime exists than *desiring what is forbidden*—
Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"If one does not see what is forbidden to desire,
the heart will not be disordered.
Human desires can reach the point
where they endanger life and virtue to contest them—
this is where crime begins."*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The heart is naturally pure and clear,
yet desires do not sprout without provocation.
Things entice from without,
and emotions give rise to desires.
The *will* is the *qi*’s leader,
and *qi* is the *body*’s fulfillment.
If one uses the *will* to command the *qi*,
and engages with things without restraint,
then the *qi* will grow exhausted,
and the heart will begin to disorder.
Thus, if one does not see what is forbidden to desire,
the heart will not be disordered.
The ignorant masses are unaware of this.
Those burdened by fame will see the *desire for reputation*,
and those burdened by profit will see the *desire for gain*—
struggles of gain and loss wage war in the breast,
reaching the point where they endanger life and virtue to contest them—
greed, corruption, deceit, and falsehood
all arise for selfish ends—
this is how crime begins."*

No greater calamity exists than *not knowing contentment*—
Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"Moderation brings blessing,
excess brings calamity.
Knowing contentment brings no shame—
what calamity could there be?"*

The *Explanatory Notes* say:
*"When Yang is bright and clear, the state of Jin is rich—*this* brings blessing.
When Yin is dark and obscured, the state of Zhou retreats—*this* brings calamity.
Thus, blessing thrives in *‘spreading’*,
while calamity arises in *‘withdrawing’*.
Yet blessing and calamity are neighbors,
and calamity and blessing rely on each other—
so moderation brings blessing,
while excess brings calamity.
The *Classics* say:
*‘No blessing is greater than having no calamity.’*
This is why.
If one does not know contentment
and strives for ever more gain,
then even noble families will have *spirits* lurking in their halls—
what calamity is greater than this?
Only by abiding in the *measure of non-corruption*
does one know contentment without shame—
what calamity could there be?"

No greater fault exists than *desiring to obtain*—
Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"To desire and then obtain
is what people blame."*」

As the valley empties and responds,
it responds yet does not cling.
The one who follows the Dao is not without desire—
desire lies in *not* indulging it.

If one exchanges oneself for things,
sees gain and forgets form,
and cannot let public virtue overcome private desire,
this is what people reject—
what greater fault is there?

Thus, the sufficiency of *knowing sufficiency*
is always sufficient.

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"When people see what is desirable,
they do not know sufficiency.
Not knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain,
and desiring to obtain sparks contention—
calamity and chaos arise,
even to the point where warhorses march at the city’s gates.

Yet if one knows sufficiency
and each abides in their nature’s allotted portion,
applying no cleverness or artifice—
merely using food and drink—
what contention could there be?"*

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Door**

Not leaving the door, one knows the world;
not peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"Though the world is vast, the Sage knows it through wisdom;
though the Way of Heaven is distant, the Sage perceives it with the heart.
Wisdom encompasses all things—
nothing is too far to examine—
so there is no need to leave the door.
The heart, subtle in its divine clarity,
penetrates even the most hidden—
so there is no need to peer through the window.
Zhuangzi said:
‘His swiftness between bowing and raising
reaches twice beyond the four seas.’
This is how the Sage operates secretly and transforms alone."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"Though the multitude of living beings is vast
and worldly affairs are complex,
the world, though great, cannot hide its nature—
this is ‘knowing it through wisdom,’
for one discerns it by principle.
The Way of Heaven is boundless and formless—
yet if one gazes at the formless,
the Way of Heaven, though distant, shares its mystery—
this is ‘seeing it with the heart,’
for one perceives it in its intangibility.
The Dao descends and gives rise to wisdom;
the Dao ascends and gives rise to spirit.
Wisdom and spirit are one—
the Sage’s spirit, boundless in its operation,
enters and exits without limit,
so wisdom and spirit together
can encompass all things—
though distant as the eight extremes,
nothing escapes their grasp.
How could one need to leave the door to know the world?
Zhuangzi said:
‘Great wisdom observes the distant;
near wisdom encompasses all things.’
The Dao-heart is subtle—
grasping it is impossible—
it permeates Heaven and permeates Earth,
so the heart unites with the Dao.
The Dao’s great root precedes Heaven and Earth,
moving yet accumulating nothing—
the heart, empty and gathering the Dao,
thus subtly manifests the divine—
though hidden in the formless,
nothing remains unseen.
How could one need to peer through the window to see the Way of Heaven?
Yang Xiong said:
‘Heaven and Earth are divine yet unfathomable,
yet the heart’s subtlety would fathom them—
this is how it is.’

Though one’s perception is boundless,
wisdom is great;
though one’s insight penetrates the hidden,
the heart is divine.
Wisdom knows nothing unknown,
the heart sees nothing unseen—
both arise from the same source of emptiness and stillness,
vast and penetrating,
so myriad transformations and changes
have no end.
The Six Perfections and Four Openings
are all within them.
Their mysterious operation begins here—
this is why the Sage, as Zhuangzi said,
discusses the human heart’s swiftness between bowing and raising,
reaching twice beyond the four seas—
only through such transformation could this be possible.
Thus the Sage operates secretly and transforms alone.

The *Liezi* says:
‘The skilled transformer’s Dao is subtle yet harmonious in agreement.
Subtle operation reveals the mystery of transformation,
as if a true sovereign moves without trace;
the foundation of solitary transformation
is like motion yet unable to stop itself.
From this, we see:
The Sage does not leave the door to know the world,
nor peer through the window to see the Way of Heaven—
how could this merely be attained through clever reasoning or subtle techniques?
The farther one goes,
the less one knows.’*

Xiuzong’s *Commentary* says:
*"Does this mean one has glimpsed the heart of Heaven and Earth?
Taking from the near—within the body—
all principles are complete.
Seeking in yin and yang, in measurements,
one only drifts farther from the Dao,
knowing less and less."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*The *Yijing* speaks of *‘seeing the emotions of Heaven and Earth’* in *Great Strength*
and *‘seeing the heart of Heaven and Earth’* in *Repetition*.
*Great Strength* is vast yet interacts with things;
*Repetition* is subtle yet distinguishes itself from things.
Only because it distinguishes itself from things
does it, when all things act together,
follow the path of emergence and return.
I observe that movement must return to stillness,
and emergence must return to repetition—
thus, I perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth are too vast to measure in an instant,
but if one makes the heart empty,
merging it with the boundless,
then the heart of Heaven and Earth *is* my heart.
What makes *Repetition* noble
is its stillness, not its movement and emergence."*

「Just by observing this, one realizes that the Dao/Way is near at hand and need not be sought from afar—
it is sufficient to take it from oneself.

Within a single body, all things are fully present;
one who practices inner observation finds everything already complete—
the most profound traces of the universe are all here.

If one can attain emptiness, hold fast to stillness,
and gather them together with the mind,
then the Dao/Way will dwell within you—
why wait to seek it far away?

To seek it through *yin-yang* (阴阳),
the Dao/Way may never leave *yin-yang*,
yet *yin-yang* cannot fully contain it;
to seek it through *measurements and calculations* (度数),
the Dao/Way may be abundant in *measurements and calculations*,
yet *measurements and calculations* cannot exhaust it.

Some may take five years yet fail to grasp it,
others twelve years yet still not attain it—
the farther one strays from the Dao/Way,
the less one truly knows.

The Dao/Way is like a great road,
bright and easily seen—
how difficult can it be to know?
The trouble lies only in not seeking it.

If one turns inward to seek within oneself,
then without form, the mind becomes complete—
one will advance beyond the mere breadth of knowledge,
and what fear is there of knowing too little?

Thus, the Sage does not act yet knows,
does not look yet names,
does not do yet achieves.
Emperor *Huìzōng* (徽宗) commented:
*With my understanding, I know the world—*
this is called *not acting yet knowing* (不行而知).
*With the mind of the Five, I perceive the Dao/Way—*
this is called *not looking yet naming* (不见而名).
If one *does not act yet knows*,
and *does not look yet names*,
then what need is there for action?
The Sage stands firm, and success comes naturally—
this is called *not doing yet achieving* (不为而成).

The *Commentary* says:
*To act and then know—*
the places one’s feet reach are near,
and one cannot perceive what lies far;
*to see and then name—*
what the eyes can grasp is shallow,
and one cannot illuminate what is hidden.
Only by *knowing the world with my understanding*
can one transcend and recognize the distant—
sufficient to penetrate the principles of the world,
even without stepping outside one’s door,
this is called *not acting yet knowing*.
Only by *perceiving the Dao/Way with my mind*
can one gaze deeply into the mysteries—
sufficient to explore the subtleties of the Dao/Way,
even without peering through a window,
this is called *not looking yet naming*.
If one *does not act yet knows*,
and *does not look yet names*,
then the vastness of the world,
the remoteness of the Dao/Way,
have never been a concern—
one follows nature effortlessly, without favor or bias,
discarding knowledge and artifice while aligning with the natural order—
what need is there for action?

By dwelling in *non-action* (无为之事),
the world will naturally achieve its functions,
thus the Sage skillfully employs subtle methods
and alone attains the clarity of the *Zhāokuàng* (昭旷).
This is indeed the Dao/Way of their own.

The world cannot grasp or know it—
perhaps they only see the Sage’s firm success.

Did *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) not say:
*The Emperor-King achieves without action,
and the world is transformed*—
is this not the meaning of *not doing yet achieving*?

*Chapter Forty-Eight: The Daily Progress of Learning*
*Learning is a daily advancement,*」

「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning seeks to attain the Dao/Way*, beginning with the cultivation of the scholar and culminating in the perfection of the Sage. With daily progress, the Dao accumulates within oneself. Confucius spoke to Yan Yuan, saying: *"I see his advancement."*

The *Cushui* (疏义) explains: *The Dao cannot be directly attained, yet there are things said to be attainable—only learning can achieve this.* Indeed, learning encompasses both the *Tian Dao* (天道, Heavenly Dao) and the *Ren Dao* (人道, Human Dao). One cultivates the desired virtues until they reach the ineffable divine, and practices filial piety until it manifests as the Sage’s Heavenly Dao—this is what the *Yǔ* (语) refers to as *"the scholar attains the Dao through learning,"* and what *Mòzǐ* (苟子) means by *"beginning as a scholar, ending as a Sage."* Only when one earnestly pursues learning will they see daily gains and forget their past ignorance, monthly progress and retain their acquired knowledge. Though daily calculations may seem insufficient, yearly reflections will yield abundance, and the Dao will naturally reside within you. This is truly *"daily advancement, the Dao accumulating within oneself."*

Yan’s son knew to emulate the lofty virtue of the *Jian Gao* (坚高), yet forgot the labor of striving upward. When asked about *ren* (仁), he diligently sought to practice it, and upon hearing its merits, he wholeheartedly embraced them without hesitation. Thus, Confucius said of him: *"Daily I see his advancement."* Is this not fitting?

*The Dao/Way is attained through daily diminishment.*
The Emperor Huizong annotates: *To attain the Dao is to abandon one’s physical form, discard sharp intellect, sever from the body and forget worldly affairs—thus it is called "diminishment."*

*Lian Boyu* (连伯玉) reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times. The *Cushui* explains: *If one knows that the body is not truly one’s own possession but merely a borrowed shape from Heaven and Earth, then they will not be burdened by the body and thus abandon physical form.* If one understands that their lifespan is finite while knowledge is boundless, then they will not cling to cleverness and thus discard sharp intellect. By severing from the body, the body cannot hinder; by forgetting worldly knowledge, the mind is unconstrained. Neither internal fluctuations nor external conformity exist—when engaged in affairs, not a single hair’s worth is spared, yet all worldly concerns vanish. Thus, it is called *"diminishment."*

*Zhuāngzǐ* said: *"Lian Boyu reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times."* This means that with each passing year, he underwent transformation until, at sixty, he had transformed sixty times—truly one who forgets the passage of years and aligns with the natural *Hua* (化, transformation) of humanity.

Observing Lian Boyu’s conduct, it is clear that the Master wished to minimize his faults yet could not fully achieve it—thus, *"reaching sixty years and yet transforming sixty times"* is understandable.

*Diminish again, and again diminish,* until one attains *non-action* (无为) yet *achieves all* (无不为).

The Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning exhausts principles and encompasses all things; the Dao fulfills one’s nature and reaches the ineffable.* To diminish again and again is to arrive at *non-being* (未始有). *Non-being* is *non-action*. In stillness, one remains unmoved—this is *non-action*. Yet one responds to all things and naturally harmonizes with the world’s patterns—this is *achieving all*.

*To attain stillness within oneself is the Dao of inner Sagehood; to act and engage with the world is the work of outer Kingship.* Both originate from this principle, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *"Stillness leads to Sagehood, movement leads to Kingship."* This is followed by *non-action* (无为) to achieve *Zhēn* (尊, reverence).

Thus, those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action* (无事). But once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.

The Emperor Huizong annotates: *The world is a great thing. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them; if one is possessed by things yet transcends them, then they can possess all things.* Those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*—this is clear.

*The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced.* Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it. Hence, once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.

The Sage embodies the Dao’s truth to govern themselves. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* (太王直父) avoided harm from the *Dí* (狄) people, did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus established his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān* (岐山).

The *Cushui* explains: *If one is confined by things, there must be something beyond them to govern them. If one is enslaved by instruments, there must be something beyond instruments to command them.* Though the *Liùhé* (六合, the six directions—Heaven, Earth, and the four cardinal points) may seem vast, they are still confined by things. What transcends them is the Dao. Though instruments may seem powerful, they are still enslaved by them. What transcends instruments is the Dao. To embody the Dao is to have no worldly affairs—thus, their use of the world is abundant. This is what *Zhuāngzǐ* meant by *"the world is a great thing; those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them, yet they possess all things."* Hence, it is clear that those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*.

If one does not embody the Dao, they will cling to affairs and thus be insufficient in their use of the world. The *Classics* say: *"The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced. Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it."* This is the case.

The Sage governs themselves with the truth of the Dao. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus avoided the *Dí* (狄) people’s calamity, establishing his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān*.

**Volume Ten of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic**

**Commentary by the Scholar Jiang Cheng on Chapter Forty-Nine: "The Sage Has No Fixed Heart"**

The Sage has no fixed heart, yet takes the hearts of the people as their own.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The heart of the Sage is the luminous reflection of all things.

Empty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—
like a mirror reflecting forms, taking all their beauty and ugliness,
like a valley echoing sounds, embracing all their vastness and minuteness—
how could there be a fixed heart?

The commentary observes all things and knows their nature,
following the people and nothing more.
This is what is meant by "taking the hearts of the people as their own."

Zhuangzi said: The lowly cannot be ignored, for they are the people.

The commentary explains: The heart is empty and unified, still and responsive.
Only emptiness can give rise to substance,
only stillness can embrace movement.
Emptiness and stillness are the root of all things.

The Sage penetrates the truth of all things and upholds their root,
thus encompassing all without discrimination,
and perceiving the four quarters with luminous knowledge.
Zhuangzi speaks of the Sage’s heart as the luminous reflection of all things,
meaning that emptiness allows for reception,
stillness allows for response—
thus, there is no fixed heart.

It is like a mirror:
not inclining nor welcoming,
yet all beauty and ugliness are revealed,
no preference nor selection made.

It is like a valley:
receiving and responding,
all vastness and minuteness arrive,
no rejection nor favor—
how could there be a fixed heart?

Though the *Yì* warns against establishing a heart that does not waver (*wùdài*), and Mencius says that not wavering over one’s possessions is a virtue, the Sage here speaks of no wavering heart—why?

The Dao’s meaning is that wavering arises from clinging to change,
while the Sage’s "no fixed heart" is not the same as the *Yì*’s warning against wavering.
The commentary observes all things and knows their nature,
following the people and nothing more—
thus, their "no fixed heart" is the very means by which they attain true constancy.

Beholding the Way of Heaven,
its seeing and hearing come from the people,
its wisdom and awe come from the people—
for it has no heart of its own.

The Sage has no heart,
only aligning with Heaven—
thus Zhuangzi says: The lowly cannot be ignored, for they are the people.

The virtuous, I treat as virtuous;
the non-virtuous, I also treat as virtuous—
then virtue is complete.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—
then trust is complete.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The virtuous and non-virtuous contradict each other,
the sincere and insincere mock each other—
common people’s emotions naturally create distinctions of good and bad,
truth and falsehood. How could this be virtue?

Virtue as virtue reveals that all actions are without exception virtuous,
so even the non-virtuous are treated as virtuous;
virtue as trust reveals that all emotions are without exception trustworthy,
so even the untrustworthy are treated as trustworthy.
True and false are both forgotten,
right and wrong are unified—
this is the person of complete virtue.

This is how Shun regarded the *Xiàng* (象),
sincerely trusting and rejoicing in it,
not regarding it as false—
thus the Sage does not distinguish between truth and falsehood.

While the Sage is in the world, their words are but clamor,
yet they muddy the hearts of the people.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: When in the world,
the Sage shares in the people’s joys and sorrows,
even if they have no fixed heart,
they cannot fail to take heed.

Thus, in governing themselves,
they are cautious and vigilant,
never at ease or idle.
In governing the world,
they equalize virtue and non-virtue,
unify trust and insincerity,
forgetting praise and blame,
and blending all into one.

The commentary explains: Knowing this and discerning it is how the Sage governs themselves;
awakening to this and merging with it is how the Sage governs others.

Thus, they demand much of themselves with thoroughness,
yet treat others with lightness and restraint.
When in the world,
they are ever watchful,
sharing in the people’s joys and sorrows,
cautious and vigilant in their warnings,
diligent in their prudence—
though they have no fixed heart,
they dare not neglect it.
Thus, even in rest, they are not at rest,
cautious and vigilant, never idle.

When governing the world,
they respond to all things,
merging beauty with ugliness,
committing right and wrong to their proper courses,
equalizing virtue and non-virtue,
unifying trust and insincerity,
embracing all the strange and wondrous—
the Dao flows as one,
and they forget praise and blame,
merging all into simplicity.

The people all focus their ears and eyes upon them,
yet the Sage treats them as children.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: Heaven’s vision comes from the people’s vision,
Heaven’s hearing comes from the people’s hearing—
thus the Sage takes the people as their heart.
The Sage acts, and all things observe them—
thus the people all focus their ears and eyes upon them.
The people rely solely on the Sage’s vision and hearing,
so the Sage is the parent of the people.

With tender care and compassion,
like protecting an infant,
they cover all beneath Heaven with benevolence.

The commentary explains: Though Heaven is high, its oversight is humble;
though Heaven is distant, its scrutiny is near—
for the Way of Heaven has no heart,
only taking all things as its heart.

Thus, the Sage never uses their own eyes,
yet through the people’s vision sees all things—
never uses their own ears,
yet through the people’s hearing hears all things.
Only Heaven is clear and wise,
only the Sage is timely and authoritative,
yet they simply take the people’s heart as their own heart.

Taking the people’s heart as their own heart,
they harbor no private thoughts yet grasp the people’s hearts,
so their actions are manifest—
like the great sun rising in the east,
those with eyes and limbs await its light to complete their tasks.
Who among the people would not focus their ears and eyes upon it?
This is what the *Yijing* says:
*"The Sage acts, and all things observe them."*

The Great Vision is above,
while the lower vision brings forth transformation—
they observe the rites and respond,
they listen to the songs and move accordingly,
so the people rely solely on the Sage’s vision and hearing.

The Sage, as the parent of the people,
treats them with love, fearing only that it may not be sufficient,
and protects them, fearing only that they may be harmed—
nurturing and fostering them,
guarding and sustaining them,
their virtue is profound indeed.

Yet the Sage’s care for the people
is not limited to that of a parent,
so their tender compassion and protective embrace,
like shielding an infant,
cannot be exhausted.

The Sage’s governance and transformation
cover all beneath Heaven—
this is why.

**Chapter Fifty: Life and Death**

Life and death,
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
All things emerge from the *machine* and return to the *machine*.
When Heaven’s *machine* expands, life begins;
when Heaven’s *machine* contracts, death ends.
The living are the initial workings of *Zao-hua*,
the dead are the transformations of *Yin-Yang*.

The commentary explains:
There is no motion without something arising,
nor anything lasting without returning to nothingness—
the interplay of existence and nonexistence
is like a mechanism that cannot act of its own accord.

All distinctions of kind and group,
all variations in movement and stillness,
are thus governed by this principle—
so all things emerge from the *machine* and return to the *machine*.

Moreover, when things arise,
they do so swiftly and with urgency,
without motion that does not alter,
nor time that does not pass.
From nonexistence to existence,
then the *void* transforms into *spirit*,
*spirit* into *qi*,
*qi* into *form*—
Heaven’s *machine* expands, and with it life begins.

From existence back to nonexistence,
then *form* transforms into *qi*,
*qi* into *spirit*,
*spirit* into *void*—
Heaven’s *machine* contracts, and with it death ends.

Yet life is the beginning of death,
and death is the completion of life—
what dies here may yet live there,
for life and death are inconstant,
and none know their measure.
Thus, the living are the initial workings of *Zao-hua*,
and the dead are the transformations of *Yin-Yang*.

The initial workings of *Zao-hua* are called *refined qi forming matter*,
the transformations of *Yin-Yang* are called *wandering souls*.

Those who follow life are thirteen in kind,
those who follow death are thirteen in kind.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Those who follow life and death
are bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return,
and thus cannot escape their fate.

The commentary explains:
When the Great Dao is obscured,
it splits into many paths.
Those who delight in life are burdened by form,
yet they do not realize that the body is not their own—
they are ensnared by the Dao’s motion,
leaning on the force of *Yin-Yang* to become followers of life.

Those who seek stillness forget their bodies,
yet they do not grasp the form of non-form—
they are drowned in the Dao’s tranquility,
halted in decay, and become followers of death.

To follow life and death,
one is already confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return,
and thus cannot escape the bonds of life and death—
both are incomplete aspects of the Dao.

The numbers begin at One,
are established at Two,
and perfected at Three.
Heaven and Earth combine to form Ten,
so Three is the completion of numbers,
and Ten is their fullness.

Those who follow life and death
pursue their own desires,
establishing their own methods,
and using numbers to justify them—
thus, in their Ten, they attain only Three,
for those confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return
cannot fully escape the cycles of *Yin-Yang*.

The people’s lives,
when they stir toward death’s domain, are also thirteen in kind.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
They blame fate while abandoning principle,
forget life while pursuing gain—
when the people’s lives stir toward death’s domain,
what choice is there between life and death?

The commentary explains:
Life is not my own,
so those who blame fate are wrong.
Thus, those who understand the nature of life
do not labor for what life cannot provide—
if one even blames fate while abandoning principle,
there are those who retain their form yet lose their life.

Life is the radiance of virtue,
so those who forget life are also wrong.
Thus, those who honor life
do not burden their bodies with profit—
if one even forgets life while pursuing gain,
there are those with excess yet whose bodies are not nourished.

The common people are deeply confused and foolish,
not enlightened nor discerning—
they stumble blindly forward,
floundering in their vitality,
revering those who cherish life with great depth yet unaware of abandoning it,
forgetting life while harming their nature, yet unaware of preserving it,
seeking alms from the kitchen and begging at the walls—
they stir toward death’s domain,
though their forms may not yet perish, their hearts are already dead.

Zhuangzi called them *Xiao-ren*,
Yangzi called them *Ye-ren*—
these are they.

Though they are called "not dead," what benefit is it?
Then their lives, what choice is there between life and death?

Why so?
Because of their excessive attachment to life.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
Those who follow life delight in life yet burden their forms,
those who follow death seek stillness yet forget their bodies.
When they stir toward death’s domain,
the crippled and the lame are everywhere,
and the prisons and punishments are in sight—
these are all those who do not know
that the body is a great affliction,
that life is limited,
and who err in their excessive reverence for living.

The ancient ones who attained the Dao
did not let wealth and honor harm their bodies,
nor did poverty and lowliness burden them with gain—
they did not rejoice in longevity,
nor lament in early death,
they awoke to solitude and saw the One,
thus they could transcend past and present
and enter the realm of neither life nor death.

The commentary explains:
The Dao is not made clear
because the wise overreach it,
and the unworthy fall short.
Those who follow life and death,
the wise are those who overreach,
and the unworthy are those who fall short—
those who stir toward death’s domain
are the unworthy who fall short.

Those who cling to life are drowned in the delusion of what compels them,
unable to forget the years and lose themselves,
ever rejoicing in life while burdening their forms.

Those who cling to death are blinded by the notion of nothingness,
unable to cherish life while preserving their forms,
ever turning toward emptiness and forgetting the body.

The debates of these two schools
each grasp one side—
examining them to their own liking,
though they do not encompass all,
they are but one-sided scholars,
thus they cannot instill fear in the people.

Those who court death’s domain
are akin to those who fail to nurture life.

For those who suffer internal punishments,
the yin and yang energies harm them;
for those who suffer external punishments,
metal and wood weapons assail them.

Only those who flee external punishments
are the ones who face the gallows in succession,
who fill the prisons in sight,
and who fall into the nets of crime in great numbers—
these are all those who do not know
that the body is a great exhaustion,
that life is limited,
and who cling too deeply to living.

The ancient ones who attained the Dao were different from these:
they knew that things abound while the form does not sustain them,
thus wealth and honor did not harm life through excessive nourishment—
different from those who devour life while defying nature;
they knew that the form does not perish while life fades,
thus poverty and lowliness did not burden the form with gain—
different from those who forget life while pursuing profit.

They knew of that which is neither ever dead nor ever born,
thus they did not rejoice in longevity nor align with those who cling to life;
they knew that what endures in me is unforgotten,
thus they did not lament early death nor align with those who cling to death.

With insight clear and vision penetrating,
they stand alone above all things,
nothing can pair with them—
they exist before Heaven and Earth without beginning,
after Heaven and Earth without end,
spanning antiquity and the present while ever enduring.
How could this be the excessive reverence for life?

As Zhuangzi said:
*"Awakening to solitude and seeing the One,
thus they could transcend past and present
and enter the realm of neither life nor death."*
This is how they attained it.

It is said that those who master nurturing life
walk on land without fear of rhinoceros or tiger,
enter battle without armor or weapons.

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger has no place to strike with its claws,
weapons have no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because they have no place of death.

The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:

Those who master nurturing life preserve their form intact and restore their essence, uniting with the Dao and thus safeguarding their natural defenses. Their spirit is unshaken, their hidden movements unimpeded, their tread upon fire unburning, their passage above all things unperturbed. Thus, they trample upon creatures without breaking, and none can harm them.

The *Yijing* says:
*"To traverse the Dao of day and night,
and enter the mechanisms of life and death—
this is the way of all things."*

To know the teachings of death and life,
and transcend the creations of things—
this is the realm of the Perfect Sage alone.

The *Cishu* explains:
*"To exist in the formless yet know the form’s formlessness—
thus the form remains whole.
To unsettle not the essence yet refine it ever deeper—
thus the essence is restored.*

When form is whole and unharmed,
and essence is restored and unlost,
then they abandon human contrivance
and align with the natural Dao.
How could one know that Heaven is not human,
or human is not Heaven?
Indeed, they unite with the Dao.

Thus, they attain completeness from Heaven,
and their natural defenses remain whole.
Their spirit is unshaken,
their hidden movements unimpeded—
solid things cannot obstruct them,
fire cannot burn them,
their passage above all things is unperturbed—
height cannot endanger them,
and the terrors of death and life do not enter their hearts.
Thus, they trample upon creatures without fear,
and none can harm them.

Therefore, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tiger,
and wild beasts cannot harm them.
They do not wear armor or wield weapons,
and blades have no place to strike them—
this is indeed the realm of no-death."

The *Yijing* says:
*"To traverse the Dao of day and night,
and know the alternating dark and bright.
Day and night succeed one another,
embracing yin and cradling yang,
bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return—
none can escape this.*

Like the owl, bright in night and dim in day,
or the kestrel, bright in day and dim in night—
this is not because day and night differ in nature,
but because they fail to traverse the Dao of day and night
and thus do not know their true essence.

All things that do not grasp the Dao
are thus bound.

Only the Perfect Sage comprehends the principles of all things,
knows the teachings of death and life,
and transcends the creations of things.
Thus, they guide all things without direction,
command all things without response,
participate in ten thousand years as one pure whole—
what weight could death and life possibly hold?"

This is called the realm of no-death—
is it not so?

**Chapter Fifty: "The Dao Gives Birth"**

The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"The Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all things.
All things flourish and grow,
yet all arise from non-action."*

The *Cishu* explains:
The *Yijing* says:
*"Silent and unmoving,
yet responsive and thus harmonizing all under Heaven—
this is the Dao."*

Silent and unmoving—
this is the essence of the Dao,
hence its constant non-action.
Responsive and thus harmonizing—
this is the function of the Dao,
hence its non-action yet all-accomplishing.

Though myriad things arise and flourish,
their origins trace back to the Dao—
this is what is meant by:
*"All things flourish and grow,
yet all arise from non-action."*

As Zhuangzi says:
*"When the two non-actions unite,
all things transform—
is this not so?"*

**The Dao nurtures virtue/power,**
The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"When things attain life through it, this is virtue/power."*

The *Cishu* explains:
*"Life is the radiance of virtue/power.
Before things take form, virtue/power is unseen.
Once life emerges, each attains its due—
thus, when speaking of life, it is called virtue/power,
for virtue/power is what grants it."*

As Zhuangzi says:
*"When things attain life through it, this is virtue/power—
thus, the Dao nurtures virtue/power."*

**The Dao shapes form,**
The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"When movement is restrained and things are born,
and life takes shape with its principles established—
this is form."*

The *Cishu* explains:
*"When yin is still and tranquil,
this is the restraint—yin itself.
When yang moves and emits,
this is the movement—yang itself.
Yang alone cannot generate,
so mere restraint is insufficient to birth things.
Yin alone cannot complete,
so restraint without movement is also insufficient to birth things.
Only when yin and yang combine in restraint and movement
do things take form.
Once life emerges, its principles are complete—
is this not the Dao shaping form?"*

**The Dao completes its essence.**
The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"When form and substance are complete,
their inherent tendencies manifest—
long and short taking shape,
high and low inclining—
this is their natural essence."*

The *Cishu* explains:
*"Bound by things, form and substance are established.
Once form and substance are complete,
their inherent tendencies manifest.
As with the crane’s long neck,
or the duck’s short—
naturally taking shape;
as with Heaven’s natural height,
or Earth’s natural low—
naturally inclining.
Is this not when form and substance are complete,
and their inherent tendencies manifest?"*

Thus, all things do not fail to revere the Dao
and honor virtue/power.

The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:
*"All things first turn to the Dao.
What is completed and elevated is virtue/power.
To revere is to overcome and diminish things,
to honor is to ensure none can degrade them.
Mencius said:
*'What Zhao Meng holds noble,
Zhao Meng can also degrade—
this is not virtue/power.'*"

The *Cishu* explains:
*"The Dao is boundless in its application,
sometimes not filling—
deep as the origin of all things,
thus all things first turn to it as the Dao.
Virtue/power is completed and elevated,
art is completed and lowered.
Thus, what is completed and elevated is virtue/power.
Opposing virtue/power, the Dao is revered,
and virtue/power is honored.
Only reverence can overcome and diminish things—
as Zhuangzi said:
*'Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
they do not depart from within.'*
Opposing things, virtue/power is honored,
and things are degraded—
as Zhuangzi said:
*'The most noble titles and ranks are thus attained.'*

Mencius said:
*'What Zhao Meng holds noble,
Zhao Meng can also degrade—
this is not true nobility,
for it lies in things, not virtue/power.'*

But virtue/power—
this is what each person holds noble within themselves,
unable to degrade.
Thus, it is the noblest under Heaven."

The *Transmission* says:
*"Only those who possess it are truly noble."*

The reverence of the Dao,
the nobility of virtue/power—
none bestow them,
yet they abide eternally natural.

Huizong’s annotation:
*"Things decay with time,
forces topple with time,
but the True Sovereign stands above the age—
true nobility lies within oneself,
not borrowed from things or forces,
yet ever remains as it is."*

Exposition:
Some stir when acted upon,
some cease when restrained—these are *things*.
Some vie in length and shortness,
some tilt in high and low—these are *forces*.
Time and fate are boundless,
yet things and forces are finite.
If confined by things,
how could decay be avoided?
If adorned by forces,
how could toppling be averted?

Only the True Sovereign stands above the age—
no thing can humble him,
true nobility lies within,
not gained through others,
not borrowed from things.
Thus, he knows no decay,
for he does not rely on things,
and knows no toppling,
for he does not rely on forces.
This is why he transcends past and present,
ever remaining as he is.

Thus, the Dao begets and nurtures,
lengthens and matures,
completes and ripens,
nourishes and shelters.

Huizong’s annotation:
*"Speaking separately, there are distinctions between virtue/power and things/forces;
speaking together, all arise from the Dao.
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things.
When all things transform and emerge, the Dao is born with them;
when all things withdraw and store, the Dao completes with them.
It emerges from *Zhen* [Thunder],
is perfected in *Gen* [Mountain],
is nurtured by *Kun* [Earth],
is sheltered by *Qian* [Heaven].
Yang and yin interact,
the Eight Trigrams resonate—
as if bound by an unseen mechanism,
the Dao pervades it all."*

Exposition:
From the Dao’s begetting to forces’ completion—
speaking separately, the four stages differ,
but speaking together, all are encompassed by the Dao.
Thus, though Heaven and Earth are vast,
each has its hidden essence,
yet the Dao generates both Heaven and Earth.
Though people are countless,
each has its hidden essence,
yet humanity is shaped by the Dao—
this is why the Dao is the hidden essence of all things.

When spring’s breath awakens and ten thousand grasses sprout,
this is the transformation of all things—
the Dao, as Heaven’s humanity, emerges with them without hesitation.
When autumn arrives and all treasures mature,
this is the withdrawal of all things—
the Dao, as humanity’s Heaven, enters with them without resistance.

Even as thunder stirs them into *Zhen*,
*Gen* restrains them into completion,
*Kun* conceals them into nurturance,
*Qian* governs them into shelter—
yang and yin interact,
generating the Six Children and completing transformations,
the Eight Trigrams resonate,
cycling sun and moon to produce cold and heat.
All things thus take form,
all flourishing things thus emerge and retreat—
as if bound by an unseen mechanism,
who could command this?
It is the Dao that pervades it all.

The Master Lao treats life, growth, nurturing, maturation, and covering as all returning to the Dao.
This is simply a comprehensive way of speaking.

To generate without possessing,
to act without claiming,
to grow without controlling—
this is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
To generate is to manifest through movement and emergence,
to act is to embody through transformation and change,
to grow is to manifest through unification and singularity—
when the Dao descends into the world,
it resides in **virtue** alone.

Yet to generate without possessing its work,
to act without claiming its ability,
to grow without seeing its meticulous craft—
unless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,
who could comprehend this?

Thus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.
The annotation explains:
Zhuangzi says, *"The luminous arises from the obscure"*—
this implies returning to the hidden to reach the manifest,
so there is the meaning of "manifesting through emergence."

The *Yijing* says, *"Transformation and change are called 'acting'*"*—
acting means to create and never cease,
so there is the meaning of "embodying through change."

The Classic says, *"The Sage employs it to become an official and leader"*—
to lead is to hold noble rank and gain the people’s trust,
so there is the meaning of "manifesting through unification."

These three aspects—
when the Dao descends into the world,
they reside in **virtue** alone.

The one who generates does so without ownership,
the one who transforms does so without attachment—
no desire for gain,
this is called **generating without possessing its work**.

The one who harmonizes all things does so without seeking righteousness,
the one whose benevolence extends to all ages does so without claiming virtue—
no pride or self-aggrandizement,
this is called **acting without claiming its ability**.

The one who covers and sustains Heaven and Earth,
who carves and shapes all forms—
without displaying the skill of their craft,
this is called **growing without seeing its meticulous craft**.

Unless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,
who could comprehend this?

Thus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.
Because the profound is subtle yet small.

---

The world has a **beginning**, which is called the **Mother of the World**.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
The **beginning** without name is Heaven and Earth,
the **Mother** with name is all things—
both the **beginning** and the **Mother** are the Dao.
From the **beginning** of *qi*, it is called **beginning**,
from the **generation** of all things, it is called **Mother**—
to have a **beginning** is to be able to generate.

The annotation explains:
Before Heaven and Earth were born, the Dao was there.
The Dao is always nameless,
so it is called the **beginning** without name.
When the Dao descends into the realm,
Heaven and Earth are the greatest—
only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things arise,
so it is called the **Mother** with name.
The Classic says, *"To know the ancient origins is called 'the Dao’s principle'*"*,
and *"It can serve as the **Mother of the World**'*"*—
thus, the **beginning** and the **Mother** are both names for the Dao.

The **beginning** refers to the **origin of *qi***,
the **generation** of all things is called *Yijing* (change),
and it is called the **Mother of the World**—
this is spoken of from the perspective of generation.
These two arise from the same source but have different names,
both called the Dao—
so the words **beginning** and **Mother** are like fishhooks.

Without a **beginning**, it enters into non-generation;
with a **beginning**, it can generate.
To call it the **Mother of the World** is to say it lies in having a **beginning**.

Once one obtains its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
The Dao can **mother** all things and name them,
so things are its **children**.
Those who understand the Dao also understand all things,
so by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.

The annotation explains:
The Classic says, *"The Dao generates them"*—
thus the Dao can **mother** all things and name them.
All things arise from the Dao,
so the Dao is their **Mother**, and things are its **children**.
Those who do not understand the Dao cannot harmonize all things;
those who understand the Dao can harmonize all things.
If one truly knows the Dao,
then the principles of all things are known without needing recognition—
so by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.
Once one knows its **children**, one again guards its **Mother**,
and thus one’s life is never in peril.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
Excessive knowledge leads to guarding it with restraint,
excessive observation leads to guarding it with precision—
to exhaust the principles of things without being burdened by them,
to reach the Dao’s full extent without losing its subtlety,
then one’s use of emergence and retreat is advantageous,
and one’s coming and going never ends—
one can preserve life, fulfill one’s years,
and avoid danger and peril.

The annotation explains:
The Dao does not desire mixture;
mixture leads to excess,
excess leads to disturbance—
so by understanding unity, all affairs are complete.
Thus, the Dao’s essence is not in complexity;
the more one hears and sees,
the less one can rely on simplicity.

The Classic says, *"Fewer things, the more one gains"*—
Mencius says, *"Returning to the concise is the way of simplicity."*
By this, one exhausts the principles of things—
then one’s broad vision sits in clarity without being burdened by them;
by this, one reaches the Dao’s full extent—
then though things are chaotic and myriad, one does not lose its subtlety.
Thus one can emerge or retreat without disadvantage,
come or go without exhausting the Dao.
To drift in ease, to rest in comfort—
the way of preserving life and fulfilling years is achieved,
and there should be no danger or peril.

Though few in knowledge, one lacks restraint;
few in observation, one lacks precision—
so one must first know its **children**,
then one can guard its **Mother**.

Block the **Treasure of *Yui***,
close its **Gate**,
and one’s life will never be weary.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
*Yui* means delight,
**Gate** means exit—
when things entice from without,
the heart delights within.
Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth—
the spirit and intelligence emerge from them.
Guard your inner self,
close your outer senses—
do not take pleasure in harmonizing things,
and things cannot lure you—
then one delights in Heaven and finds self-satisfaction.
Who would toil endlessly for things?

The **spirit and intelligence** emerge from them—this is so.

Only knowing **harmony**,
one joyfully communicates without losing oneself to *Yui*.
With **inner restraint**,
one repels the myriad directions,
presenting them before yet never entering their embrace;
with **outer closure**,
one remains still and unmoved,
not taking pleasure in harmonizing things,
not seeing what is desirable—
then things cannot lure one.

If so, one finds delight in **Dao** without worry,
self-satisfaction in self-satisfaction—
who would toil endlessly for things?
This is called **eternal stillness**.

Open its *Yui*,
complete its affairs—
then **eternal stillness** is lost forever.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
To foolishly perceive what is pleasing,
to engage with it and thus be drawn—
then one’s life is spent in ceaseless strife,
yet never sees success.

The *Cushui* says:
*Yui* means delight—
when its *Yui* is closed, things cannot lure;
when its *Yui* is opened, one foolishly perceives what is desirable.
If things cannot lure,
one knows to restrain the inner self,
to close the outer senses.
If one foolishly perceives what is desirable,
then one takes pleasure in harmonizing things,
and things gain the power to lure.
If such is the case,
one clashes with things in battle,
one is worn down by them in transformation—
how could one know delight in **Dao** and self-satisfaction,
and not take things as one’s concern?

To toil endlessly like this,
seeking success through deeds,
yet never seeing it—
then one is lost in confusion, unaware of return,
entrapped and unable to retreat,
losing one’s nature greatly—
this is called **eternal stillness** undone.

To see what is small is to be clear,
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
Smallness is the **mystery of the Dao**.
To see the **mystery of the Dao**,
is to know oneself—
thus there is no lack of clarity.

The *Cushui* says:
To return to smallness and discern through things,
then smallness is the **Dao’s return to non-action**.
What is called seeing smallness,
is to see the **mystery of the Dao** alone.
To see the **mystery of the Dao**,
is to know oneself.
Only by knowing oneself,
is there no unknown—
as the *Classic* says:
*"To know oneself is to be clear."*

To guard softness is to be strong,
The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
Softness is the **root of the Dao**.
To guard the **root of the Dao**,
is to conquer oneself—
thus there is no unvanquished.
The *Cushui* says:
The utmost softness conquers the utmost firmness in the world—
thus softness is the **root of the Dao**.
What is called guarding softness,
is to conquer one’s selfish desires.
To conquer one’s selfish desires,
is to conquer oneself.
Only by conquering oneself,
is there no unvanquished—
as the *Classic* says:
*"To conquer oneself is to be strong."*

To employ its **light**,
and return to its **clarity**.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
**Clarity** is the essence of **light**.
**Light** is the function of **clarity**.
When the Sage responds to the world,
from essence arises function—
then radiance spreads as **light**,
and when function is withdrawn to essence—
then wisdom penetrates as **clarity**.
To display **ren** outwardly,
to conceal it in action—
like the sun and moon:
all things are illuminated and clear,
yet never diminished—
this is how one manifests the **virtue of spirit and clarity**.

The *Cushui* says:
**Clarity** and **light**,
different names, same reality—
from essence arises function,
then **clarity** disperses as **light**,
so **light** is the function of **clarity**.
When function is withdrawn to essence,
then **light** returns to **clarity**,
so **clarity** is the essence of **light**.
When the Sage responds to the world,
**clarity** emerges as **light**,
then **light** shines upon the four quarters—
this is called:
*"From essence arises function,
then radiance spreads as **light**."*
When **light** returns to **clarity**,
then its **clarity** ascends—
this is called:
*"Function is withdrawn to essence,
then wisdom penetrates as **clarity**."*
Thus, to employ its **light**,
though **ren** may sometimes be displayed,
to return to its **clarity**,
while **light** is naturally concealed—
like the sun and moon adorned in the sky,
illuminating all things—
the **clarity** of the sun and moon
is never truly diminished.
The *Yijing* speaks of *"manifesting the **virtue of spirit and clarity**"*—
this is why.

Without abandoning the body to misfortune,
this is called **embracing constancy**.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
The transformation of things is without constancy.
Only those who return to **command** abandon things and distance themselves from people,
returning to **clarity** without joining the transformation of things—
thus they embody constancy without harm,
differing from those who scheme with form to create **light**.

The *Cushui* says:
The **spirit** transforms into decay,
decay transforms back into **spirit**—
this is the **transformation of things** without constancy.
But if one returns to **command**, it is not so:
abandoning wisdom and returning to simplicity,
one distances oneself from things and people,
returning to **stillness and clarity** while regaining **clarity**—
enduring through ages yet unchanging,
transcending all forms without alteration—
how could one join the transformation of things?
To know **command** within oneself,
as when spring and summer return to autumn and winter,
embracing nature while preserving life—
this is why one embodies constancy without harm.
Then how different is this
from those who scheme with form to create **light**,
and thus must avoid them like a recluse!

*"Let me stand firm with knowledge of the fifth-thirty-third,*
walking the **Great Dao**,
only **generosity** do I fear.*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:
The **Dao** rejects excess and extravagance—
excess leads to licentiousness in **virtue**,
extravagance leads to wastefulness in nature—
**generosity** is the fault.
**Firmness** is smallness discerning through things.
To stand firm and discern through things,
while inwardly knowing oneself—
then one’s roots are deep and foundation solid,
taking sufficiency in one’s own body—
thus one fears only **generosity**.

The *Cushui* says:
Excess and extravagance,
the **Dao** rejects them—
thus the *Classic* says:
*"The Sage rejects excess and extravagance."*
Excess leads to licentiousness in **virtue**,
not the *"inner preservation while outer senses remain undisturbed."*
Extravagance leads to wastefulness in nature,
not the *"inner simplicity walking the **Dao of the Nameless**."*
Excess and extravagance,
are not the **Dao of frugality and generosity**.
To be small and sidelong is not **firmness**—
**firmness** is not its nature,
but to discern and assist.
This is the meaning of **firmness**—
thus **firmness** is smallness discerning through things.
To stand firm and discern through things,
one does not take pleasure in harmonizing things—
thus one is not lured by things,
while inwardly knowing oneself.
If so,
then one’s nature returns to itself,
one’s form is preserved whole—
deep roots and solid foundation are achieved.
Indeed, **nature** is the root of form,
and form is its foundation.

With deep roots and firm foundations,
one returns to guarding its **Mother**—
*indulging in virtue* and *excessive nature*?
How could this be the **Dao**?

Only the **inner observation** is cultivated,
not the **outer pursuits**—
those who suffice within themselves
have truly attained it.

*"Only giving is feared,"*
for it differs from those who *aspire to temporal gain*.
The **Great Dao** is most level,
yet people prefer shortcuts.

*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"The Dao is level, while shortcuts are swift—
to seek swiftness for near-term success
is only to distance oneself from the Dao."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"If the Dao is like a great highway,
then the Dao is level indeed.
To walk without shortcuts,
then shortcuts are swift indeed.*
*The **I Ching** says: "Dwelling long in the Dao brings harmony to all under heaven,"*
*and the **Book of Poetry** speaks of the Zhou King’s longevity through virtuous governance—*
*yet to seek swiftness for near-term success*
*is only to distance oneself from the Dao.*

The court is *excessively formal*,
the fields are *neglected and overgrown*,
the granaries are *emptied*—
*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"To honor the worthy and employ the capable,
to achieve governance in the court,
yet to neglect diligent farming and accumulating wealth,
to fail in fostering a prosperous people—*
this is to *pursue trifles while abandoning the fundamentals*,
not a **Dao** that can endure."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"To rectify the court is to rectify all officials—*
the court is the *source of governance*.
Once the people are flourishing,
what further need is there?
To say *‘wealth’*,
the prosperity of the people is the *foundation of governance*—*
to achieve the **Dao of governance**,
one must first establish the *foundation of governance*.
Thus, Shun’s commissioning of **Jie** was followed by **Ben’s** instruction to sow seeds,
and Mencius spoke of not *disrupting agricultural seasons* before exhorting filial piety and fraternal duty.
*Farming is the fundamental basis of the state.*
The reason kings can endure long and prosper is because they *root themselves in this **Dao***.
Yet to honor the worthy and employ the capable,
to achieve governance in the court,
yet to neglect diligent farming and accumulating wealth,
to fail in fostering a prosperous people—
this is to *pursue trifles while abandoning the fundamentals*,
not a **Dao** that can endure."*

To *adorn oneself in fine attire*,
to *wear sharp blades at one’s side*,
to *disdain plain food*,
while *abundant wealth* is held as honor—
this is *robber’s display*,
not the **Dao**!

*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"Those within the **inner simplicity** walk the **Dao of the Nameless**,
those outside it *aspire to temporal gain*.
To walk the **Dao of the Nameless**,
one fears only *excessive giving*—
to *aspire to temporal gain*,
one adorns oneself in fine attire,
wears sharp blades at one’s side,
disdains plain food,
and holds abundant wealth as honor,
while insufficiency is shame—
*consumption and extravagance extinguish righteousness*,
*arrogance and indulgence lead to false display*—
how could this be the **Dao**?"*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"Those within the **inner simplicity***
are those who *embody it within themselves*.
*Those outside it*
are those who *pursue it externally*.
*The **Nameless Dao***
is the *subtle essence of the **Dao***.
*Temporal gain*
depends on *external things*.
Those within the **inner simplicity** walk the **Dao of the Nameless**,
thus *suffice within themselves* and fear only *excessive giving*.
Those outside it *aspire to temporal gain*,
thus find pleasure in *harmonizing with things*—
adorn themselves in fine attire,
wear sharp blades at one’s side,
disdain plain food,
and hold abundant wealth as honor,
while insufficiency is shame.
To *adorn oneself in fine attire* and *disdain plain food*,
is to *shame coarse garments and coarse food*—
yet this is not enough to discuss.
To *wear sharp blades at one’s side*,
is to *fail in understanding that tranquility is supreme*.
To hold abundant wealth as honor,
while insufficiency is shame—
this is not *‘I am content whether in poverty or wealth’*,
but *‘I find joy in both abundance and scarcity’*.
If so,
*consumption and extravagance extinguish righteousness*,
*arrogance and indulgence lead to false display*—
how could this be the **Dao**?"

**Chapter 54: The Good at Establishing Do Not Pull Up the Stems**
The good at establishing do not pull up the stems—
*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"Establishing the **Central Dao** unites all above and below,
thus one does not pull up the stems."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"The **Central** is the *great foundation of all under heaven*.
Only by *fully aligning with the **Central Dao***
can one *stand upright in the two realms* (of heaven and earth),
*unbiased and harmonious*,
*penetrating and unifying all above and below*—
this is to *establish the **Central Dao***.
To *establish the **Central Dao***
is to *uphold the **Dao** within oneself*,
thus one does not pull up the stems.

*The **Classic of Documents** says: "Establish the **Central Dao** among the people."*
Only by *employing the **Central Dao** among the people*
can they *never forget it*.
The good at establishing do not pull up the stems—
this is clear.

The good at embracing do not lose their hold—
*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"Embracing **Oneness** to respond to all transformations,
thus one does not lose their hold."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"**Oneness** is the *most subtle essence of all under heaven*.
Only by *conforming to the **Dao** of **Oneness***
can one *vastly transcend all movements*,
*emerge to interact with things*,
*meet all transformations with ease*—
this is to *embrace **Oneness** while never losing their hold*.
To *embrace **Oneness***
is to *never lose it*,
thus one does not lose their hold.

*The **Classic** says: "Can one embrace **Oneness** without departing from it?"*
Only by *embracing **Oneness** and never departing from its **subtle essence***
does the **subtle essence** merge with the **spirit**—
the good at embracing do not lose their hold—
this is clear.

Descendants continue the sacrifices without ceasing—
*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"To establish the **Central Dao** without straying from the **Dao**,
to embrace **Oneness** without departing from its **subtle essence**—*
if so,
how could one’s influence be limited to a single state,
or their virtue confined to one generation?
Their transmission will be *far-reaching indeed*."*

*Explanatory Notes* say:
*"Mencius said: ‘Standing in the **Central Dao**,’
and ‘to establish the **Central Dao** without straying from the **Dao**’
is to *respond to all under heaven with subtle application*.
Zhuangzi said: ‘The **perfect penetration of **Oneness***,’
and ‘to embrace **Oneness** without departing from its **subtle essence***
is to *merge with the **most subtle essence of all under heaven***.
*Subtle application is inexhaustible*,
*permeating all ages without flaw*;
*The **most subtle essence** flows universally*,
*transforming all things without limit*.
If so,
their *virtue reaches the four seas*,
their *benefits extend to future generations*.
Their *application is ever-widening*—
not merely confined to a single state,
but *spread universally across all under heaven*.
Their *duration is everlasting*—
not merely confined to one generation,
but *passing down through all future ages*.
Descendants preserve the sacrifices
through *countless generations*—
their transmission will be *far-reaching indeed*,
how could it not be *trustworthy*?"

To cultivate it in oneself,
its **virtue/power** becomes *true*;
To cultivate it in the family,
its **virtue/power** becomes *excessive*;
To cultivate it in the village,
its **virtue/power** becomes *long-lasting*;
To cultivate it in the state,
its **virtue/power** becomes *abundant*;
To cultivate it in all under heaven,
its **virtue/power** becomes *universal*.

*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"To cultivate it in oneself,
its **virtue/power** becomes *true*—*
this is the **Dao**’s truth in governing oneself.
To cultivate it in the family,
its **virtue/power** becomes *excessive*—*
this is the **Dao**’s remnants in governing others."*

「To cultivate it in the state,
its **virtue/power** becomes *abundant*—*
to cultivate it throughout all under heaven,
its **virtue/power** becomes *universal*—*
this is the **Dao**’s *straightforwardness* (土直) in governing the states and all under heaven.

The farther one’s cultivation extends,
the broader one’s **virtue/power** spreads—
all within oneself is its *true* essence,
while outward manifestations are but its *remnants*.
Hence, *excessive* (余) follows *true*,
*abundant* follows *long-lasting* (长),
and these belong to the **Dao**’s external unfoldings.

*Cushui* (疏义) explains:
*"The noble one’s practice begins by cultivating oneself,
and thus all under heaven is at peace.
First, one cultivates oneself;
last, one cultivates all under heaven.
From inner to outer,
from near to far—
this is the sequence of cultivating **virtue/power**.

To cultivate it in oneself,
its **virtue/power** becomes *true*—*
all things are fully present within me,
turn inward and be sincere,
and there is no greater joy.
*Possession* (具) refers to the utmost sincerity,
thus cultivating oneself yields *true* **virtue/power**,
as said: *the **Dao**’s truth in governing oneself.*

The *Classic of Documents* (《书》) states:
*"The **Dao** accumulates in one’s person."*
Thus, how one governs oneself through the **Dao**’s *truth* is clear.

To cultivate it in the family,
its **virtue/power** becomes *excessive*—*
to cultivate it in the village,
its **virtue/power** becomes *long-lasting*—*
for once **virtue/power** is sufficient within oneself,
ordering the family leaves ample room,
extending it to the village ensures it endures without ceasing—
as said: *the **Dao**’s remnants in governing others.*

Master Zhuang (庄子) said:
*"The **Dao** acts upon all things;
the highest governance of others is through *affairs* (事)."*
Thus, how one governs others through the **Dao**’s *remnants* is clear.

To cultivate it in the state,
its **virtue/power** becomes *abundant*—*
to cultivate it throughout all under heaven,
its **virtue/power** becomes *universal*—*
for once **virtue/power** is shared with others,
applying it to the realm brings fullness and sufficiency,
extending it to all under heaven covers all broadly—
as said: *the **Dao**’s *straightforwardness* in governing states and all under heaven.*

Master Yang (杨子) said:
*"Though all under heaven is vast,
governing it lies in the **Dao**."*
Thus, how one governs states and all under heaven through the **Dao**’s *straightforwardness* is clear.

The farther one’s cultivation extends,
the more **virtue/power**’s resonance endures—
reaching the utmost distance,
as said: *"The near can be extended through this."*

The broader one’s **virtue/power** spreads,
the more *profound virtue* (盛德) is called *new*—*
reaching boundless scope,
as said: *"The extent of **virtue/power**’s reach."*

All within oneself is its *true* essence,
thus *true* lies in the inner,
to receive from Heaven.
Outward manifestations are but its *remnants*,
thus *remnants* lie in the outer,
to propagate afar—
hence, *excessive* follows *true*,
*abundant* follows *long-lasting*,
and these belong to the **Dao**’s external unfoldings.

Indeed, the **Dao** is what all things follow;
**virtue/power** is the **Dao** within oneself—
*excessive*, *long-lasting*, *abundant*, *universal*—
all are the **Dao** manifesting as **virtue/power**,
thus they belong to the **Dao**’s external unfoldings.

Yet the Sage, through the **Dao**,
governs oneself without straying from *truth*—
even when cultivating all under heaven,
only the **Dao**’s *remnants* and *straightforwardness* emerge in response.
The reason it is *true* is that it neither harms nor benefits—
the Sage values *truth* precisely for this.

Thus, one observes oneself through oneself,
one’s family through one’s family,
one’s village through one’s village,
one’s state through one’s state,
and all under heaven through all under heaven.

*Huizong’s Commentary* (徽宗注) says:
*"All things are fully present within me,
turn inward and be sincere,
and there is no greater joy—
thus observing oneself through oneself brings self-governance,
and this applies by analogy."*

All under heaven has its *constant nature* (常然),
and all things arise from it,
all find fulfillment in it—
by extending the *constant nature* of my heart
to all under heaven,
those of like kind respond without losing their *constant nature*.

Thus, one governs all under heaven without actively governing—
for *observation* (观) requires
that the higher observe the lower,
then the lower may observe the higher.
Observing from above to below,
as in the *I Ching*’s *"central rectitude in observing all under heaven"*—
observing from below to above,
as in the *Rites of Zhou*’s *"commanding all the people to observe the governance’s symbols"*—
the observation of higher and lower is thus.

If the higher and lower observe in this way,
then following them becomes effortless.

As the *Records* (《记》) say:
*"First cultivate oneself, then harmonize the family,
harmonize the family, then govern the state,
govern the state, then bring peace to all under heaven—*
this aligns perfectly with the above.

How do I know all under heaven is thus?
Through this.

*Huizong’s Commentary* says:
*"The simple and easy reveal all under heaven’s principles."*

*Cushui* (疏义) explains:
*"The *trigram Qian* (乾) is firm and constant,
its **Dao** seemingly difficult,
yet it shows people the ever-easy.
The *trigram Kun* (坤) is receptive and yielding,
its **Dao** seemingly complex,
yet it shows people the ever-simple.
Qian and Kun reveal the simple and easy to people,
thus the governance’s symbols are observable—
easy to know, simple to follow.
Easy to know without fearing what is hard to know,
simple to follow without fearing what is hard to follow—
then though the talents and principles of all under heaven
are hidden in the utmost traces,
they can be penetrated and understood without remainder,
what need is there to seek elsewhere?
From this perspective,
one sees that the Sage’s practice is the most restrained,
yet its application is the most expansive—
achieved through the simple and easy,
thus it is said: *‘Observe Heaven and Earth, and you will see the Sage.’*
The chapter *"Thick with Virtue"* (含德之厚), the fifty-fifth.*」

**Thick with Virtue** compares to the infant.

The **Huizong Commentary** says: Only when a person’s virtue is profound does their nature not shift with things. Thick with virtue, they do not stray with things, thus their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.

Mencius said: The noble person does not lose the heart of an infant.

The **Exegesis** says: Who among those born with innate nature does not cherish this virtuous excellence? Yet when they interact with others, few can uphold it.

Only when virtue is profound does one speak of its root in nature. If one strays with things, then nature is submerged in artifice.

Only those thick with virtue do not see strange things and stray from them. Not straying with things, their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.

Thus **Liezi** said: In infancy, *qi* is concentrated and will is singular—this is the utmost harmony. Things cannot harm them, and no virtue surpasses them.

*Qi* is empty and awaits things; when concentrated, it is still and unmixed—this aligns with the *Classic*’s “concentrating *qi* to govern softness.”

Will is where the mind directs itself; when singular, it is unified and not divided—this aligns with Confucius’ “as one whose will is singular.”

When *qi* is concentrated and will is singular, constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to infancy—thus Mencius praised the noble person who does not lose the heart of an infant.

Indeed, fulfilling one’s nature is the noble person’s affair. To fulfill one’s nature is to be substantial yet not lose the source of emptiness, to act yet not lose the basis of stillness—this is the infant’s purity without deficiency, truth without artifice. What need for choice?

Thus the great person dwells in profundity, not shallowness. Poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, snatching birds do not strike.

The **Huizong Commentary** says: Those thick with virtue have no place for worry to enter, no room for perverse *qi* to attack—thus nothing can harm them.

**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to engage with the world, who can harm them?

The **Exegesis** says: The world values the infant because they are still and unchanging, pure and unadulterated, free from the fear of misfortune, unburdened by perverse *qi*.

Thick with virtue compares to the infant—thus worry cannot enter, perverse *qi* cannot attack. Worry comes from without, hence “enter.” Perverse *qi* seizes gaps, hence “attack.” If worry cannot enter, their virtue is whole; if perverse *qi* cannot attack, their spirit is unharmed.

If so, calamity does not come, fortune does not arrive—unmoved by things’ gains and harms, thus nothing can harm them. If nothing can harm them, they have nothing to oppose, reaching the utmost emptiness.

**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to wander in the world, who can harm them? Indeed, the utmost emptiness leaves no opening for things—like an empty boat struck by currents, even those with narrow minds do not anger.

If a person attains emptiness to wander among worldly affairs, yielding and conforming like flowing water, who can harm them? This is how the perfected one’s mind works like a mirror—neither grasping nor resisting, responding without storing, thus able to overcome things without harm. This too is emptiness.

Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. They do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—this is the utmost *jing*.

The **Huizong Commentary** says: When virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. When form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit—**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*.

The **Exegesis** says: Life is the radiance of virtue; to preserve virtue is to preserve form—this is “virtue whole, form whole.” The body is the dwelling of the spirit; to preserve form is to preserve spirit—this is “form whole, spirit whole.”

When virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm—because their form is generated without exhaustion, they do not know where to take hold, yet their grip is firm. This differs from laboring the form without rest, leading to exhaustion.

When form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—because their spirit is whole and unharmed, they do not know what to unite with, yet they are aroused. This differs from overusing *jing* without cessation, leading to depletion.

Without the utmost *jing*, who could achieve this? Only the utmost *jing* in the world can merge with the utmost spirit of the world. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit, thus *jing* and spirit merge without separation.

**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*—because the singular *jing* harmonizes with the natural order. If a person harmonizes with the natural order, they are also the natural order itself. This is why the Sage values *jing*.

When **Zhuangzi** discusses nurturing the spirit, his words touch on valuing *jing*—is this not because spirit and *jing* arise from the Dao, and form originates from *jing*? Is there not truth in this?

To cry all day yet the voice does not grow hoarse—this is the utmost harmony.

The **Huizong Commentary** says: Attaining singularity is called *jing*; *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed. Pure *qi* achieves harmony, thus harmony means *qi* is whole and the voice does not grow hoarse.

A person’s life receives *jing* from Heaven’s One to become the source of wisdom, and harmony from Heaven’s Five to become the foundation of trust. When perfected, they can enter the spirit, can restore their vital command.

But those who lose the heart of an infant—*jing* wavers and is not preserved, *qi* erupts and is not pure, they abandon their innate nature, submerging it in myriad things. Is this not tragic?

The **Exegesis** says: All things transform through *jing* and take form; they receive One to live. Concentrating One is called *jing*. Attaining singularity means not being divided—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s “speaking of attaining singularity.”

*Jing* is the utmost rectitude of Heaven’s virtue; preserving *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed—this is “their Heavenly Guard is whole, their spirit has no flaws.”

All things bear yin and embrace yang; obtaining the balance of yin and yang, pure *qi* achieves harmony.

The harmonizing *qi* interflows and achieves balance—this aligns with Zhuangzi’s account of the harmonious *qi* as the essence of humanity.

Balance, when expressed, is always measured and harmonious. When balance is attained, *qi* is whole and the throat does not constrict—this is what is meant by: *"The elder brother cries all day but his throat never constricts; this is the ultimate of harmony."*

Human life begins when *jing* is received from Heaven’s One, becoming the root of wisdom, and when balance is attained from Heaven’s Five, becoming the foundation of sincerity.

Indeed, *jing* is what the One generates; it is received from Heaven’s One as water, corresponding to the North in direction, and thus becomes the root of wisdom. Balance is what *qi* attains; it is received from Heaven’s Five as earth, residing centrally in position, and thus becomes the foundation of sincerity.

When humans are born, they embody the five phases, from Heaven’s One to Heaven’s Five, and the numbers of their formation are complete. If one truly preserves the One and dwells in balance, and further cultivates the self, they may live a thousand two hundred years without ever decaying in form.

When they attain this state, can they not enter the spirit and restore their vital command?

To enter the spirit is to attain the ineffable—this is what is meant by *"the profound essence entering the spirit."*

To restore the vital command is to return to stillness—this is what is meant by *"stillness is called restoring the vital command."*

Yet the world’s people lose their infantile heart because their *jing* wavers and is not preserved, their *qi* erupts and is not pure. How much more could they know of not letting their *jing* waver, preserving it and not losing it, and not letting their *qi* erupt, making it pure and unharmed?

Instead, they abandon their innate nature to harm their life, submerging themselves in myriad things to drown their desires. Their self-abandonment is so extreme—is this not tragic?

**Knowing harmony is constancy.**
Huizong’s annotation: *"The preservation of pure qi, with vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish."*

The **Exegesis** says: *"Balance is the great harmony with all things."*

Guan Yin’s discourse on the Perfect One, who walks above all things without fear, states: *"This is the preservation of pure qi."*

If one can preserve their *qi*, making it pure and unadulterated, then its gentle harmony is evident.

Only when harmony is perfected can one traverse the beginning and end of all things, and communicate with the creation of all things—this is what is meant by *"vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish."*

When vital command is governed within, creation originates from oneself, enduring through all ages and eternally existing.

When form transforms while nature does not perish, one nature remains constant, enduring myriad forms without change, encompassing Heaven and Earth, inheriting the primal *qi*—how could this not be called constancy?

**Knowing constancy is clarity.**
Huizong’s annotation: *"Clarity suffices to perceive the Dao because it knows nature does not perish."*

The **Exegesis** says: *"The *Transmission* says: Inner vision is called clarity."*

Clarity suffices to perceive the Dao—this is beyond the reach of mere sight. Above form, one gazes with spirit alone, still and returning to the origin, awakening to see the singular. Then one knows that nature abides within, eternally fixed since antiquity.

As in the *Yijing*: *"Nurturing nature, nature abides—this is the gateway to Dao and virtue."*

Because nature abides, its abiding is the gateway to Dao and virtue, then Heaven and Earth are born from it—even Heaven and Earth depend on this to be born. How could clarity not suffice to perceive the Dao, knowing that nature does not perish?

**Augmenting life brings omens.**
Huizong’s annotation: *"Omens are the presages of things; the principle of generating life, when augmented, becomes superfluous—fortune and misfortune are yet undetermined."*

The **Exegesis** says: *"Divine omens manifest as signs; knowing how to respond, omens are the presages of things. Fortune and misfortune are already foretold—how could one escape their response?"*

Moreover, the generation of things is complete in its own principle. To augment it only adds excess, like hastening the growth of seedlings—this is to encourage what is already complete. These are all instances of humans aiding Heaven, yet fortune and misfortune remain undetermined.

Only by following nature without augmentation, without letting likes and dislikes internally harm the body, can one attain Heaven’s fullest bestowal.

**The heart directs *qi* as strength.**
Huizong’s annotation: *"When the body aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with *qi*, then *qi* is harmonious and does not erupt. The stumbling and rushing are *qi*—yet the heart truly compels this strength."*

To contend with things in this way is not the path of self-mastery.

The **Exegesis** says: *"The body is the heart’s dwelling."*

When the body aligns with the heart, all actions of the four limbs are rooted in the heart. The heart is the sovereign of *qi*.

When the heart aligns with *qi*, then cultivating the mind in stillness allows *qi* to merge with emptiness. Kang Changzi said: *"If the body aligns with the heart and the heart aligns with *qi*, then in the way of nurturing *qi*, one knows its foundation."*

Only when *qi* is properly nurtured can it be harmonious and not erupt, achieving ultimate softness.

Now, the stumbling and rushing—when walking, they do not conform to Xia Wu’s measured steps, and when moving, they do not conform to the graceful *Shao Hao*—all are the result of erupting *qi*.

If stumbling and rushing persist, even if the leader of *qi* is at fault, it is truly the heart that compels it—this is what is called *"strength."* To contend with things in this way means joy aligns with yang and anger aligns with yin, yet this is not the path of self-mastery. How could people know that harmony and softness suffice to pacify things, making them unable to harm?

**When things flourish, they age—this is called not the Dao.**
Huizong’s annotation: *"The Dao knows no past or future, yet things have flourishing and aging, strength has its time of weakness, and prosperity has its time of decline. They are enslaved by time and governed by fate—how could this be the Dao?"*

The **Exegesis** says: *"There are those who live, and those who give life; there are those with form, and those who shape form. The Dao knows no past or future, so giving life never ends, and shaping form never ceases. This is what Zhuangzi meant by *self-rooted, self-originating, eternally fixed since antiquity.*"*

「When things have phases of flourishing and aging, then there is the *Dao of life and death*—this is what Liezi meant by *the great transformation* where youth is followed by vigor, then old age and decrepitude.

Only in their transformation from youth to vigor, from vigor to old age, do the principles of strength and weakness, rise and decline manifest. Bound by the *造物* [Creator’s] silent decree, they cannot escape—thus strength has its time of weakness, and one must consider softness; prosperity has its time of decline, and one must reflect on repose.

They are enslaved by time as *overflowing and deficient*, constrained by fate as *abundant and scarce*—how could this be the Dao?

The Dao is *not the Dao* from the very beginning. Huizong’s annotation: *"The Dao has never been exhausted, yet the people’s confusion persists, saying it is so since ancient times."*

The **Exegesis** says: *"The *Wuji* [Non-Extreme] contains no *Wuji*, the *Wujin* [Non-Exhaustion] contains no *Wujin*—thus the Dao is never exhausted.

Those who lose their nature in worldly affairs see only things, not the Dao. As form transforms, their minds are equally bewildered, and they never understand it their whole lives. The people’s confusion has indeed been long-standing—how could they know the Dao has endured eternally, without ever perishing, throughout all time?

*Laozi’s True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue—Exegesis, Volume Ten concluded. Volume Eleven begins.*」

The scholar Jiang Cheng of the Imperial Academy expounds:

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**
*"The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know."*

Huizong’s annotation: *"The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. Thus, those who know the Dao remain silent and intuitively grasp it, having no need to speak."*

Yiqié questioned Wangni, yet through four inquiries and four unknowns, his words exhausted themselves, and he grew distant from the Dao.

**Exegesis:**
What can be articulated is but the coarse nature of things.
What can be intuited is the refined essence of things.
The Dao’s supreme refinement is profound and inscrutable—though one might wish to speak of it, words fail to capture it, hence there are no questions.

For there is an entrance to the Dao, one may question it.
But the Dao itself has no entrance—who can question it?
For there are questions, one may respond to them.
But the Dao itself has no questions—who can respond to it?
Thus, those who seek answers to questions about the Dao do not know the Dao.
The sage explains this by saying:
*"The Dao can be received by spirit but not transmitted through speech;
it can be intuitively grasped by the heart but not sought through outward traces."*
So, the ultimate speech transcends speech,
and attains the mystery of silence—
one must remain silent and intuitively grasp it.

If one sees the Dao with the eyes, it remains stored within—
how can it be contained by sound?
What need then for speech?

The *Yijing* speaks of *"silent and it is accomplished"*,
Liezi speaks of *"silent and it is attained"*—
this is the very meaning.

In the past, when Yiqié questioned Wangni,
he first asked of what all things are the same—
Wangni did not know.
Then he asked of knowing what one does not know—
Wangni did not know.
Next he asked of things having no knowledge—
Wangni did not know.
Finally, he asked of knowing not being ignorance and ignorance not being knowing—
Wangni did not know.
Four questions, four unknowns.

Not that he did not know—
rather, knowing was shallow, ignorance profound;
knowing was external, ignorance internal—
his unknown was the true knowing.

But those who cling to words,
entangled in endless speech, cannot escape confusion—
who knows that the Dao cannot be spoken of,
and yet speech is inevitable?

Block its *fuè* [receptive/outward aspect],
close its entrance—

Huizong’s annotation: *"Dull the senses and preserve the spirit; withdraw and hide in secrecy."*

**Exegesis:**
For those whose outward aspect is confused,
one cannot grasp them through excessive speech
to lead them to the inward essence;
for those whose inward aspect is confused,
one cannot entangle them in convoluted speech
to lead them to the outward essence.
Block its *fuè*, then there is no confusion of inward and outward,
and the harmonious joy flows freely without losing its receptivity.

In sleep, the *hun* [ethereal soul] mingles;
in waking, the form opens.
Engaging with others brings discord—
it is called *"fighting with the heart"*—
close its entrance, then there is no peril of heart-fighting.
The well-closed cannot be opened without a key.

This is what Zhuangzi called *"dull the senses and preserve the spirit,"*
and what the *Yijing* called *"withdraw and hide in secrecy."*

For dulling the senses brings clarity to the Dao’s inscrutable depth,
unlured by things, one can thus embrace the spirit in stillness
and merge with it—
this is called *"blocking its fuè."*

Hiding in secrecy returns to the origin of nature,
where nothing enters of its own accord—
one can thus conceal within heaven and merge with heaven—
this is called *"closing its entrance."*

Guangchengzi said:
*"Guard your inward self,
seal your outward self,
dull its sharpness,
unravel its confusion."*

Huizong’s annotation: *"Take depth as root,
take restraint as measure."*

**Exegesis:**
Sharpness is like fire’s form—
it cannot avoid injury,
but if dulled, it will not harm.
Confusion is like tangled threads—
it cannot avoid disorder,
but if unraveled, it will not be disordered.
This is what Zhuangzi called *"take depth as root,
take restraint as measure."*

For depth aligns with the *Yijing*’s *"ultimate depth and probing the subtle"*—
taking depth as root means one does not follow superficial trends,
interacting with things without harming them,
and things cannot harm one—
this is called *"dull its sharpness."*

Restraint aligns with Mencius’ *"guard restraint while applying breadth"*—
taking restraint as measure means one does not drown the heart in excess,
though myriad affairs unfold before one,
yet cannot enter to merge—
this is called *"unravel its confusion."*

Harmonize its radiance,
align with its dust—

Huizong’s annotation: *"Follow things with flexibility,
and conform to their currents."*

**Exegesis:**
Harmonize refers to its non-defiance;
align refers to its non-separation.
Harmonizing its radiance means radiance without dazzle—
not like the formed and polished that produces light.
Aligning with its dust means great unity with things—
not like those who withdraw from the world and differ from customs.
This is Zhuangzi’s *"follow things with flexibility and conform to their currents."*

Only by shifting with the times,
and rising or falling with the world,
flexing and yielding without clashing with things,
never setting oneself apart in rigid distinction,
can one attain this.

This is called *Xuántóng* [Mysterious Unity].

Huizong’s annotation: *"The Dao returns to the utmost profound,
and unites with the utmost singular—
the utmost profound is called Mysterious,
the singular is called Unity.
Mysterious Unity means all things and I,
yet choosing among them is impossible—
how could one secretly entangle oneself in distinctions of near and far,
benefit and harm,
nobility and lowliness?"*

**Exegesis:**
Entering the inscrutable gate,
concealing the Dao without revealing it—
this is returning to the utmost profound.
Merging in the primal chaos,
gathering all into one Dao—
this is uniting with the utmost singular.
Returning to the utmost profound,
it dwells in subtle transformations—
small yet wondrous—
hence the term *Mysterious*.
Uniting with the utmost singular,
it encompasses all distinctions—
different yet unified—
hence the term *Unity*.

Only when the small merges with things,
obtaining their singularity and aligning with it,
does one know that things are inherently without things,
and I am not truly I—
when things and self are both forgotten,
all things and I become one,
and choosing among them is impossible—
how could one secretly entangle oneself in near and far,
benefit and harm,
nobility and lowliness?

For all distinctions are originally non-existent—
one cannot attain to be near,
one cannot attain to be distant,
one cannot attain to benefit,
one cannot attain to harm,
one cannot attain to nobility,
one cannot attain to lowliness—
thus one is noble for all under heaven.

Huizong’s annotation: *"The world’s people attack each other with love and hate,
and thus have attitudes of nearness and distance.
Emotions and pretense influence each other,
and thus distinctions of benefit and harm arise.
Actions vie for advantage,
and thus divisions of nobility and lowliness emerge.
These fluctuate endlessly,
never reaching an end—
how can they suffice to be noble for all under heaven?"*

Those who know the Dao transcend words,
those who transcend words extinguish love and hatred,
forget emotions and pretense,
abandon gain and loss,
and merge in mystery with the One Nature within—
thus their nobility is complete,
and all under heaven is forgotten,
hence they are noble for all under heaven.

**Cui’s Annotation:** The passions of the world
create their own likeness and difference,
their own right and wrong,
their own gain and loss.
When aligned with oneself, one loves it;
when divergent from oneself, one hates it—
love and hatred clash, giving rise to nearness and distance.
To depart from passion is wrong,
to depart from pretense is right—
passion and pretense intertwine, giving rise to perceptions of benefit and harm.
What one possesses is lowly;
what one loses, one mourns—
what one gains at the moment is noble, and one rejoices in it—
gain and loss vie for advantage, creating distinctions of nobility and lowliness.
These distinctions arise and vanish,
shift and alternate,
ebbing and flowing without end—
how far they are from the Dao!
How can they suffice to be noble for all under heaven?

But the Dao is that which all under heaven do not fail to be noble in.
Those who know the Dao understand this,
penetrate the true nature of things,
and preserve their root.
They transcend words and cast off the burden of speech,
love what is not loved,
hate what is not hated—
and thus extinguish love and hatred.
Thus they have no extreme nearness,
no extreme distance—
nearness and distance cannot be attained.
Passion is not true,
pretense is not false—
and thus they forget emotions and pretense.
Thus they do not cling to benefit,
nor resist harm—
benefit and harm cannot be attained.
There is no use in what is used,
what is used is not truly useful—
and thus they depart from gain and loss.
Thus nobility and lowliness are not in them—
nobility and lowliness do not belong to themselves.
Only knowing the One Nature’s truth,
they do not see the world’s pretense—
their nobility is complete,
all under heaven is forgotten,
hence they are noble for all under heaven.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**
To govern with rectitude,
to employ the extraordinary in warfare,
and to take all under heaven with non-action.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Rectitude is the Dao’s constancy,
the extraordinary is the Dao’s variation,
non-action is the Dao’s truth.
The nation is settled by rectitude,
victory in war comes from the extraordinary,
the Dao’s truth is without private interference.
Following things in their natural course,
all under heaven is governed.

**Cui’s Annotation:** Uprightness is rectitude;
rectitude is to abide in the One.
Only by abiding in the One
does one preserve the eternal constancy—
thus rectitude is the Dao’s constancy.
Rectitude again becomes extraordinary;
the extraordinary is to oppose rectitude.
Only by opposing rectitude
does one abandon the old constancy—
thus the extraordinary is the Dao’s variation.
Truth varies with things,
yet never lacks—
truth abides within,
and thus one does not externally engage in affairs—
thus non-action is the Dao’s truth.
What is first in governing the nation?
Only to abide in the One.
The nation is settled by rectitude—
this is what Mencius said: *"One rectitude and the nation is settled."*
To hold victory has its method,
strategic planning is all—
this is what Zhuangzi said: *"Continuous and cautious, unmeasurable and unconquerable."*
Truth is the utmost of sincerity;
only when one is empty of worldly concerns
can truth be preserved—
thus the Dao’s truth is without private interference.
Without private interference,
one does not contrive pretense for others,
and simply follows things in their natural course.
If so, then without deliberate governance,
all under heaven is governed.
The Classic says: *"Thus those who take all under heaven,
always do so with non-action."*

How do I know this is so?
The world abounds in prohibitions,
yet the people grow ever poorer.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** The people are not difficult to gather—
love them and they become close,
benefit them and they come.
But if one governs with what they hate,
they scatter.
Now without hearts of love and benefit,
yet with many prohibitions and strict scrutiny,
the people will scatter to the four quarters—
thus the people grow ever poorer.

**Cui’s Annotation:** To gain all under heaven has its method,
to gain its people is to gain all under heaven.
To gain its people has its method,
to gain their hearts is to gain the people.
For indeed, to love and benefit them
is how one gains their hearts.
To impose what they hate
is to lose their hearts.
This one loves them because I love them—
thus they love me as a parent.
This one benefits them because I benefit them—
thus they carry their children and come to me.
If one oppresses them to satisfy one’s desires,
exploits them to sustain oneself,
and imposes what they hate,
then they will all take each other’s hands and depart.
Thus without hearts of love and benefit,
yet indulging in cruelty to assert one’s power,
with many prohibitions and harsh scrutiny to claim one’s wisdom,
one cannot enrich the people with governance—
the people will scatter to the four quarters,
and the common folk will barely suffice.
This is called *"overflowing above and leaking below"*—
who knows the way of governance being dim and murky,
while its people are pure and simple?

When people abound in clever tools,
the state grows increasingly corrupt.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who have clever devices must have clever schemes,
those who have clever schemes must have clever hearts.
Clever hearts arise, and then purity and simplicity are incomplete—
sometimes deceiving the ruler to oppose the Dao.

**Cui’s Annotation:** If one makes measures and weights to regulate them,
they will also use measures and weights to steal.
If one makes scales and balances to weigh them,
they will also use scales and balances to steal—
thus breaking measures and weights,
the people will not contend.
Yet those who possess clever devices
must have clever schemes,
and those who have clever schemes
must have clever hearts—
this is why the *I Ching* speaks of the "Old Man of Han Yin."
Indeed, the *I Ching* says:
*"The creative (乾) is known by its ease,
the receptive (坤) by its simplicity,
and thus the principles of all under heaven are attained."*
Once clever devices are made,
clever schemes will inevitably take form,
and once clever schemes take form,
clever hearts will inevitably arise.
When clever hearts arise,
what was once empty becomes filled,
what was once unified becomes scattered—
the so-called *"without mixing with anything, pure and unstained"*
may well be diminished—
this is why purity and simplicity are incomplete.
One will see cleverness and deceit clash,
artifice and pretense flourish daily—
sometimes deceiving the ruler to oppose the Dao—
this is why the Sage acts,
yet pardons all under heaven,
to remove this calamity.

When people rely too much on cleverness,
strange things will proliferate.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"If cleverness prevails, people will turn to frivolous pursuits,
and thus strange garments and odd instruments will emerge to disrupt customs."*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"If one man does not plow,
the whole world will suffer from his hunger;
therefore, the ancient sages taught the people
to avoid useless labor that harms productive work,
and to value practical goods over rare ones,
lest frivolous pursuits harm agriculture."*

In the age of supreme virtue,
the people are simple and unadorned,
knowing only the daily necessities of food and drink—
who among them would have the skill for elaborate cleverness?

Indeed, if cleverness prevails,
people will turn to frivolous pursuits,
and thus strange garments and odd instruments will emerge to disrupt customs.

The ancient rulers governed by this principle:
whenever strange garments or odd instruments were sold in the marketplace
or brought into the palace,
there were fixed punishments to uphold the essential
and suppress the frivolous,
so that the people might return
to the honest and steadfast customs of old.

As laws and decrees grow stricter,
thieves and robbers multiply.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"If strictness becomes excessive,
there will inevitably arise hearts that defy it."*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"To observe the deep fish is an ill omen,
to outwit the hidden is to invite calamity;
thus, once laws are established, deceit arises,
and once decrees are issued, trickery flourishes.*
If one merely taxes a few bushels of grain
and multiplies laws to oppress the people,
one will not stop theft—
for theft will persist.
This is what *Zhuangzi* meant when he said:
*'If strictness becomes excessive,
there will inevitably arise hearts that defy it.'*
This is the truth of it.

The people, being simple and unknowing,
if treated gently will submit,
if oppressed will seek vengeance—
unless the ruler governs with benevolence,
who would willingly reform and avoid crime?

Thus, the Sage governs through policy,
aligns through punishment,
and the people escape punishment yet feel no shame.

Hence, the Sage declares:
*"I act without action, and the people transform themselves."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"Heaven governs without action and remains clear,
Earth governs without action and remains tranquil;
when these two—without action—harmonize,
all things naturally transform.
The Sage follows Heaven and Earth alone,
so the people reform without knowing who guides them."*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"Heaven’s movement is without action,
yet its clarity is pure and unadulterated—
it nurtures life and covers all without fail.
Earth’s dwelling is without action,
yet its stillness is unchanging—
it bears form and sustains all without omission.
Pure and unadulterated clarity is evident,
tranquil stillness is evident—
all this comes from attaining the Way of non-action.
Heaven and Earth blend in their non-action,
and all things transform and arise.
Observing Heaven and Earth reveals the Sage—
what need is there for action?
The Sage merely follows Heaven and Earth.*

Thus, the violent and fierce transform into the yielding,
those who bend to private interests transform into the public-spirited,
and all who harbor criminal intent
are led to pursue their own solitary ambition—
the people daily reform,
yet do not know who guides them.

*"I cherish stillness, and the people align themselves."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"The balance’s interaction with form
requires no contrivance of skill,
yet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it—
how much more so does it need hooks, cords, or measuring tools
before things can be made straight?"*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"If the balance is clear, dust and filth cannot cling;
if the water is still, even whiskers and eyebrows are reflected.
The balance and the water achieve this
because they remain singular and unchanging,
steady and responsive in nature.
The *Classic* says:
*'The balance’s interaction with form
requires no contrivance of skill,
yet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it'—*
this speaks of its stillness.
The Sage’s use of the heart
is like this:
he guards stillness with unwavering devotion,
yet does not let movement disrupt his nature—
simply following his natural course,
undisturbed and unruffled.
How much more so does he need hooks, cords, or measuring tools
before things can be made straight?"*

Thus, the Way of governance values clarity and stillness,
and the people naturally align themselves.
The *Classic* states:
*"Clarity and stillness are the rectification for all under heaven."*

*"I act without interference, and the people grow rich."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"The world is originally without interference—
it is only the vulgar who disturb it.
If one does not disturb it,
the people will naturally grow rich."*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"To govern a great nation is like cooking a small fresh fish—
if one overcooks it, the fish spoils;
if one overgoverns the people, they become confused.
The Sage pardons all under heaven,
forgetting distinctions in Dao/Way and skill,
like fish forgetting the rivers and lakes—
then there is no interference,
and life flourishes in order.
Is not the Way of enriching the people
found in this absence of interference?
Yet the world is originally without interference—
it is only the vulgar who disturb it.
Those who later alter the ancient ways
and disrupt the established order to invite disaster
do not understand the Way of enriching the people."*

*"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"If one does not prize the virtuous,
the people will not vie for them;
if one does not value hard-to-obtain goods,
the people will not become thieves—
this aligns with having no desires,
and thus the people’s nature is preserved."*

The *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:
*"To promote the virtuous leads the people to compete;
thus, by not prizing the virtuous,
the people do not vie for them.
Hard-to-obtain goods provoke obstruction;
thus, by not valuing hard-to-obtain goods,
the people do not become thieves.
If one does not prize the virtuous
and does not value goods,
then the people see nothing to desire.
The Sage’s use of the heart
aligns with having no desires—
this is called *substance-simplicity*,
and substance-simplicity preserves the people’s nature.

*Substance-simplicity* is the complete embodiment of the Dao,
before it disperses into things.
If the people return to their simplicity,
they see the Dao and not things,
and what they see surpasses what they merely observe.
If one cannot abandon desires and dispel longings,
one will still be ensnared by things—
one will still be bound by the threads of artificiality,
one will still be enslaved by the schemes of others—
then the people lose their simplicity,
drowning in human artifice—
how could they ever restore the ancient winds of virtue?"

The *Laozi* wrote:
*"Do not see what is desirable,
so that the heart does not become disturbed."*
*"No greater crime than desiring what is desirable."*
*"Fewer private concerns and lesser desires—
for desires harm nature,
and they must be dispelled."*

The *Mencius* said:
*"When it comes to being human,
those with many desires,
even if they have some virtue,
are few indeed."*

Its governance is obscure and profound—
the fifty-eighth chapter—
its governance is obscure and profound...

In governing with leniency, the people know of it,
yet they lack the joy of exultation.

The *Commentary* explains:
"The world has innate *virtue/power* (*德*), and each *virtue/power* has its natural *qi* (*性*).
It cannot be forced—
to force it is to contrive (*伪*),
it cannot be disturbed—
to disturb it brings anxiety.
Only by letting *qi* unfold without excess,
and by granting leniency so that *virtue/power* does not stray,
can one bring the whole world to a realm of tranquil simplicity (*澹汉*).
Then the people will all say, 'He governs us naturally,'
as the *Laozi* described when he said,
'*The people know of it* yet it brings them no exultation.'

When the people know of it,
their *qi* does not grow more vital,
their *virtue/power* does not diminish—
relaxed and harmonious, without exultation,
yet they still hold praise beyond measure.

Did the *Mencius* say:
'*The people of a king are pure and bright* (*皡皡如也*).
Is this not the governance of tranquil simplicity?'

As for the people being sincere (*淳淳*):
The *Huizong* annotation says:
'*Seeing simplicity and embracing naturalness, few private concerns and lesser desires.*'

The *Commentary* explains:
'*Simplicity and naturalness* (*素朴*) are the people’s innate *qi*.
To see and embrace it,
then purity and clarity remain unadulterated,
stillness and unity unchanging,
and they reach the point of *illuminating clarity* (*明白入素*),
where governance is effortless and naturalness restored.

*Private desires* (*私欲*) are the people’s emotions.
To have few private concerns and lesser desires,
then they conquer themselves in victory,
excel in nurturing the heart,
and reach the point of *turning from self for the public* (*背私为公*),
where they no longer see what is desirable.
No greater sincerity than this.

As for governance being *clear and strict* (*察察*),

*Huizong* annotation says:
"To issue simple orders and enforce them strictly—like combing hair after loosening it, or counting grains before cooking—
this is to take petty matters as brilliance (*窃窃然以苛为明*), the very essence of *clear and strict* governance."

The *Commentary* explains:
"The key to governance lies in the *Dao*, which must not be burdensome.
The Sage governs through the *Dao* in the world,
by assuming the utmost *emptiness* (*至虚*) to welcome the myriad forms of reality,
and by embodying the utmost *stillness* (*至静*) to receive the ceaseless movements of life—
thus achieving simplicity yet effectiveness.
They never resort to issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly,
nor take petty matters as brilliance.

Indeed, issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly
exhausts the spirit in trivial affairs,
and wearies the mind in insignificant matters.
To take petty matters as brilliance,
how can this suffice to benefit the world?

Thus, the *Dao* of governance values *clarity and stillness* (*清静*), letting the people regulate themselves.
When the people are *confused and restless* (*缺缺*),

*Huizong* annotation says:
"To elevate the worthy brings strife among the people (*举贤则民相轧*),
to entrust the clever leads to theft among the people (*任知则民相盗*),
thus there is no *full virtue* (*全德*)."

The *Commentary* explains:
"The Sage’s governance always ensures the people have no knowledge nor desires.
To elevate the worthy, the people will vie and compete (*跨跂而相轧*),
unable to settle their *fate’s distinctions* (*性命之分*);
to entrust the clever, the people will covet and plunder (*觊觎而相盗*),
unable to quiet their *fate’s emotions* (*性命之情*).

This is the peril of knowledge and desire (*有知有欲之为患*),
and the reason the people are led astray by external things (*迁於物*).
When led astray by external things,
it is insufficient to enrich the people,
thus there is no *full virtue*.

*Zhuangzi* says:
"*Full virtue* preserves the body (*德全者形全*),
and failing to preserve *full virtue*,
nourishing the body cannot sustain life—
this is what is meant by *the body’s essence being greatly depleted* (*形精大亏*),’
is it not the state of the people being *confused and restless* (*缺缺*)?

*Misfortune* and *fortune* are interdependent (*祸兮福所倚，福兮祸所伏*),
who knows their limits?

*Huizong* annotation says:
"*Illuminating clarity* (*昭昭*) arises from *obscurity* (*冥冥*),
and *order* (*有伦*) emerges from *formlessness* (*无形*).
*Virtue* and *wisdom* guard against *intellect*,
and their essence lies in *sickness and health* (*疢疾*).
In households of *high clarity* (*高明之家*),
spirits survey their halls (*鬼瞰其室*),
for they know time cannot be halted,
ranks cannot be fixed,
and beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined—
thus, the interdependence of *misfortune* and *fortune*,
what constancy can there be?

The *Commentary* explains:
Within *emptiness* and *stillness* (*虚静*),
the Great Transformation subtly shifts (*大化密移*),
from hidden to revealed (*由隐而之显*),
from nonexistence to manifestation (*自无而适有*).
If one lacks the true Sovereign yet fails to discern its signs (*不得其朕*),
then *illuminating clarity* arises from *obscurity*,
and *order* emerges from *formlessness*.

The *spirit* (*精神*) in its manifestation is *illuminating clarity*,
yet the *Dao*’s ultimate truth remains *formless*;
the *essence* (*精*) of things, once fully realized, is *formless*,
but their *order* (*有伦*) in completion reveals *form*.

The principles of *misfortune* and *fortune*
are concealed in the depths of existence,
responding like echoes and shadows (*应若影响*),
or the silent operation of the Transformative Mechanism (*化机*).
Only those who *penetrate* (*达者*) know
that *benefit* can generate *harm* (*利足以生害*),
and *joy* can breed *sorrow* (*乐足以生忧*).
Thus, they can apply *intellect* (*智*) at the outset,
before chaos has taken root (*未奔沈之初*),
and illuminate the path
amidst the faint and fleeting (*忽眇绵*),
so that *spontaneity* (*诞先*) may ascend
to the realm of effortless virtue (*无难之地*).

The *Mencius* warns of *breathing with caution* (*虑息之戒*), saying:
"*Virtue* and *wisdom* shield against *intellect*,
and their essence lies in *sickness and health* (*德慧卫智，存乎疢疾*),"
while *Yang Xiong*’s *Self-Parody* (*解嘲论*) states:
"*High clarity* households are watched by spirits (*高明之家，鬼瞰其室*),"
both penetrating this very truth.

Indeed, *virtue* and *wisdom* shield against *intellect*—
this can be called *clear and sagacious* (*明哲*),
yet they still hold *sickness and health* (*疢疾*) as their core,
for the *gentleman* must anticipate calamities and prepare defenses (*思患而豫防*).

*High clarity* households can be free of worry (*无虞*),
yet they must speak of spirits watching their halls (*鬼瞰其室*),
for spirits bring harm to the overfilled and fortune to the modest (*害盈而福谦*).

Observing this,
one must know that time cannot be halted (*时无止*),
ranks cannot be fixed (*分无常*),
and beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined (*终始无故*),
for this is the path to true understanding.

To know time cannot be halted,
one remains distant yet unconstrained (*遥而不闷*),
gathering without strain (*掇而不跂*);
to know ranks cannot be fixed,
one discerns excess and deficiency (*察乎盈虚*),
and neither gain nor loss can perturb the heart (*得失不足以撄其心*);
to know beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined,
one comprehends the way of *effortless spontaneity* (*坦涂*),
and neither death nor life can burden the heart (*死生不足以累其心*).

When time cannot be halted,
one passes through without lingering;
when ranks cannot be fixed,
one adapts without clinging;
when beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined,
one never finds fault—
thus, *misfortune* and *fortune* are interdependent,
mutually consuming and growing (*相为消长*),
what constancy can there be?

It is said that *fortune* is the beginning of *misfortune*,
and *misfortune* is the stage for *fortune*—
this is because their constancy is ever-changing, never fixed (*无常未始有极*).

What of *right* and *wrong*?
*Huizong* annotation says:
"If those who are *same* as me and you (*我与若*) are *right*,
then *winter* is *right* (*正冬*).
If they are *same* as me and you,
how can they be *right*?
If those who are *different* from me and you are *right*,
then *right* them.
If they are *different* from me and you,
how can they be *right*?
Then who can be the *ultimate right* for the world?"

The *Commentary* explains:
The world’s *right* and *wrong* (*是非*)
are nothing but the *same* and *different* between me and you (*我与若相为同异*).
If those who are *same* as me and you are *right*,
then *right* them.
Yet if they are *same* as me and you,
then both are *right*—
how can they be *right*?

If those who are *different* from me and you are *right*,
then *right* them.
Yet if they are *different* from me and you,
then both are *wrong*—
how can they be *right*?

If neither me nor you can truly know each other,
then who can know the *ultimate right* of the world?

If one cannot discern the *ultimate right*,
then their *body* knows only comfort and ease (*安佚*),
but not the *right* place to be (*正处*);
their *mouth* knows only coarse and fine tastes (*刍豢*),
but not the *right* flavor (*正味*);
their *eyes* know only beautiful colors (*美色*),
but not the *right* hues (*正色*).
This is the failure to attain *right* knowledge (*正知*).

Thus, the path of *right* and *wrong*,
how can I know its true distinctions?

*Right* becomes *strange* (*奇*),
*good* becomes *disastrous* (*祆*).
The people’s confusion (*迷*)
has been long since established.

「Emperor Huizong annotated: The world is but one *qi* in flow. What was *right* today may be *wrong* tomorrow; what was once *united* may later be *disjointed*. The divine and the foul, the fragrant and the putrid, arise in perpetual succession—thus, the *strange* and the *right* intergenerate, the *disastrous* and the *good* transform in cycles, all as the natural unfolding of one *qi*.

The world’s formation has endured long, yet minor confusions invert directions—turning east to west, facing the *Dark Mountain* yet failing to see it; great confusions distort nature—mistaking the nonexistent for the real, abandoning the *Mysterious Pearl* yet never seeking it. The habit of self-interest prevails, blinding them to the *curved* and the *straight*; they fail to grasp the *inverted* and *upright* interplay of calamity and fortune. Moreover, they scrutinize with rigid precision, yet only deepen their bewilderment—unresponsive, unenlightened. How then can the people return to their true essence?

Thus, Laozi composed the *Political Confusion* chapter, intending to guide the people back to simplicity and purity, to return to their true nature.

Hence, the Sage remains *square* yet does not cleave: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Square* means steadfast in discernment, yet the *Great Square* has no corners—still yet fluid, leaving no trace of rigid distinctions. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those bound by *square* forms cling to fixed views, differing from customs; this is the “steadfast in discernment” of which we speak. *Steadfast* here aligns with the *I Ching*’s “interposed” (*jiè*), as in *interposed* between stones. The *Great Square* has no bounds—no south nor north, its vastness dissolving in all directions, sufficient to answer the *unbounded* Way. It is not like those who cling to *square* forms, treating them as mere *vessels*.

The Sage remains *still* yet does not stagnate: This mirrors the *Great Stillness* above, untouched by fluctuations, like water settled in repose. The master carpenter takes its form as law, leaving no path of rigid distinctions—is this not what Confucius called “first stabilizing, then responding”?

The Sage remains *honest* yet does not excess: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Honest* yet excessive breeds arrogance; radiant yet blinding invites ruin. The Sage holds *straightness* within yet bends without, wielding light yet returning to clarity—only the Sage can do so.

The people’s confusion lies in treating *square* as *right*—like the *Child Mo* who clings to the center, or the *Middle Son* who holds to rigid virtue. They know extension yet not contraction, prominence yet not subtlety, and thus lose the Sage’s *Great Harmony*, boasting of superficial customs while neglecting the whole. How can they rectify the world?

What then is the Sage’s method to rectify the world? Simply this.

The Sage remains *clean* yet does not exclude: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Clean* yet excluding leads to harshness; the *Great Honest* is unobstructed, pure yet receptive, without rigid judgment. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those who guard their *cleanliness* with caution often pride themselves in self-purification—this is the “pride in self-purification” of which we speak. *Pride* here aligns with the *Analects*’ “the ancient *pride*” in *clean* conduct. The *Great Honest* is unobstructed, fully content without further demands, serene in self-sufficiency, rejecting the laborious and difficult. It is not like those who cling to *clean* yet fail to trust—rather, it is like the *Analects*’ “victorious yet unharmed.”

The Sage remains *bright* yet does not dazzle.»

「The *Cushioned Explanation* states: If one is rigid in self-righteousness and calls it *straightforwardness*, then *straightforwardness* will inevitably indulge one’s emotions, giving rise to the arrogance of trampling others. Only by abandoning the burdens of extreme rectitude and avoiding the faults of crookedness and strain can one achieve *straightforwardness* without indulgence. When applied to things, it moves flexibly and adaptably, never clashing with the world, and thus the arrogance of trampling others does not arise.

If one takes delight in pleasing the crowd and calls it *brightness*, then *brightness* will inevitably dazzle with outward display, inviting the calamity of boasting. Only by discarding the superficial brilliance of contrived appearances and the ostentatious glare of insincere flattery can one attain *brightness* without dazzle. When its radiance is used to illuminate action, it follows the times and conforms to things, never forcing the heart’s accord, and thus the calamity of boasting does not arise. This is how one remains *straightforward* inwardly yet *flexible* outwardly, wielding its *brightness* while restoring its *clarity*—this is the unique way of the Sage.

Indeed, inward *straightforwardness* is what aligns one with the *Dao* of Heaven. Outward *flexibility* is what harmonizes one with humanity. Only the fully *flexible* and *crooked* can achieve *straightness*—this is the Sage’s virtue. Wielding its *brightness* reveals all *Ren* (benevolence). Restoring its *clarity* conceals the subtleties of application. Only those who follow the manifest yet grasp the hidden, and who discern the pivotal yet remain in the mysterious, can achieve this.

For the Sage alone can harmonize with Heaven, humanity, and the divine *clarity*. Their virtue cannot be matched by others. As for the people’s confusion, it has long been so. Those who cling to *rigid* principles as truth, like **Zǐ Mò** (子莫) who grasped the *Middle*, cannot adapt with expedience and thus discard the hundred for the one. Those who prize *upright* conduct as truth, like **Zhòngzǐ** (仲子) who upheld *purity*, cannot fulfill its broader scope and thus stain themselves while disrupting harmony. To yield is *crookedness*; to advance is *extension*. Knowing *extension* yet not *crookedness*, one is fixed in rigidity and cannot harmonize with the natural flow—how then can one know *crookedness* and *extension* in mutual accord, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “beneficial for use, secure in abiding”?

The *hidden* is the *profound*; the *manifest* is the *displayed*. Knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*, one is trapped in superficiality and cannot inherit its *clarity*—how then can one know the *profound* and the *displayed*, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “discerning the few, this is the divine”?

**Zǐ Mò**’s grasp of the *Middle*, **Zhòngzǐ**’s rigid *purity*, knowing only *extension* yet not *crookedness*, knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*—all these are blinded by private bias, narrow and incomplete. They strain their intentions and boast of their conduct to flaunt the flaws of the age, losing the Sage’s full completeness. They do not see the pure and complete essence of Heaven, Earth, and the ancient worthies—how can they rectify the world?

This is the failure to rectify oneself while presuming to rectify others—clearly, they do not comprehend what is possible. The Sage’s way of rectifying the world is simply this: *rigid* yet not divisive, *upright* yet not rigidly harsh, *straightforward* yet not indulgent, *bright* yet not dazzling.

The Sage embodies the complete beauty of the *Dao*, holding fast to the *One* as the model for the world. By extending this, rectifying the world’s true essence becomes a mere formality. This is how **Great Shun** could rectify all beings, achieving governance through *non-action*.

**Chapter 59: Rectifying Humanity and Serving Heaven**

Rectifying humanity and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses *frugality*.

Emperor Huizong annotated: *Hearing* (聪明) and *intelligence* (智识) are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* (动) and *rest** (静), *thought* (思), and *deliberation* (虑) are human affairs. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest*, moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation*—this is how one rectifies humanity. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* nor fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence*—this is how one serves Heaven. This is called *frugality*.

The *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng* organs (脏), with the *kidneys* (肾) as its domain. Established in the *unyielding field* (不贷之圃), when *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: To know what Heaven does and what humanity does—this is the ultimate. Thus, in attaining the natural, there is no action not of Heaven; in observing expedience, there is no action not of humanity. *Hearing* and *intelligence* arise from the natural and are perfected by Heaven, hence **Han Fei** said: *Hearing* and *intelligence* are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation*, emerge from expedience and are rooted in humanity, hence **Han Fei** said: *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation* are human affairs. To rectify humanity and serve Heaven, one must first prioritize *frugality*—for *action* and *rest* have their constants, the true *principle*. What one thinks and deliberates is the ultimate *Dao*. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest* ensures that *action* occurs only at its proper time. Moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation* leads to a tranquil, ever-serene state. Observing expedience in human affairs—this is *frugality* in its essence.

To abandon *hearing* is to align with the *Great Harmony* (大通). To discard *intelligence* is to follow Heaven’s *principle*. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* allows one to *withdraw sight* and *return hearing* (收视反听). Not fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence* enables one to *revert to simplicity* and *return to purity* (还淳复朴). Attaining the natural in Heaven’s affairs—this too is *frugality*.

Indeed, the *One* of Heaven generates *water* (水), which in humanity is *essence* (精). The *kidneys* are the *zàng* organ that houses *essence*. The *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng*, its origin rooted in the *unyielding field*—hence the *kidneys* are its domain. Yet it does not depart from *essence*, for this is the way of the *Divine Person* (神人). Thus, in rectifying humanity and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses *frugality*.

Established in the *unyielding field*, one fears only excess. When *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, it does not waste itself in virtue. By this means, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained. Only through *frugality* does one achieve early restoration.

Emperor Huizong annotated: Restoration comes late when one awakens from confusion. If one seeks restoration before confusion sets in, *frugality* does not waste itself in human nature—thus, restoration comes early.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: To attain one’s *nature* (性) is to perpetuate life endlessly; to lose one’s *nature* is to fail in perpetuation and reach exhaustion. To return to one’s original *nature* and restore its essence, one must value swift restoration. Restoration after confusion is far removed from the original *nature*—this is the people’s long-standing confusion, the cause of their late awakening.»

「Observe the thunder within the earth—it is *Fù* (復) in the *Hexagram*, yet the first line of nine states: *"No regret, supreme auspiciousness."* But the top line of six becomes ominous. For the first line’s *Fù* is near, while the top line’s *Fù* comes only after confusion has taken hold.

The *Hexagram of Fù* (比) likewise: the first line speaks of *"There is another,"* auspicious; the sixth line declares *"Fù without a head,"* ominous. This is because *Fù* and *Bǐ* (比) prefer to act early.

To practice *frugality* is to not waste one’s *nature* (性), and when *nature* is yet near its source, restoration comes early. Early restoration is called *accumulating virtue* (重积德).

Emperor Huizong annotated: *Fù* (復) is the root of virtue. When one restores through self-awareness, the Dao within us grows daily and ever renews.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Virtue is attainment. Attainment from one’s *nature* is what is meant. To observe *Fù* (復) in the midst of the *common multitude* (芸芸), to *Fù* (復) at the very moment of *adversity* (挠挠), is to never stray from one’s *nature*. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *Fù* (復), the root of virtue.

If one can restore to its root, then *nature* is cultivated and virtue is perfected, and wisdom will never fail to illuminate. Thus, the *Book of Changes* again says: *Fù* (復) with self-awareness. Therefore, when one does not waste one’s *nature* and restores early, virtue grows daily and becomes vast.

The *Classic of Documents* (《书》) says: Virtue is renewed daily, and again renewed daily. *Accumulating virtue* (重积德) means none can overcome it.

Emperor Huizong annotated: To conquer is to prevail. To govern all things and command the myriad movements without any that cannot be overcome—this is virtue alone.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: When virtue is complete within oneself, one does not seek to conquer others but prevails over all. Thus, within oneself it is abundant, and when bestowed upon others, there is still surplus. In its operation and response, it is boundless and universally applicable, its radiance extending to the four quarters and reaching both above and below. Who can know its limits?

Mencius said: Virtue’s teachings overflow abundantly, permeating the four seas. If none can know its limits, one can have a kingdom. Emperor Huizong annotated: When virtue is fully realized and boundless, its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a single kingdom?

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: The true Dao begins with governing oneself; its excess is applied to the state, and its fullness extends to the world. When virtue reaches the stage of *Fù* (復) in its original state, it is boundless and pure. This is what Zhuangzi called *exhausting the whole to achieve unity* (周尽一体). Though the world is vast, it lies within one’s grasp, so its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a small kingdom?

The mother of having a kingdom can endure forever. Emperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and those who possess the Dao will never falter throughout the ages.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: The world has a beginning, and this beginning is the mother of the world. Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things. From formed existence to formlessness, from having a mind to being mindless, all arise from it. Hence, it is called the mother.

The mother of having a kingdom is the possession of the Dao. Those who attain the Dao transcend time, enduring forever without flaw—what is this if not longevity and eternal vision?

Emperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring. *Nature* (性) is the root of form, and form is its foundation. Knowing its offspring and guarding its mother, one will not perish in life. Thus, one can endure forever. A deep root secures its foundation; restoring *nature* preserves form. Aligned with Heaven and Earth, one attains eternal life. Sharing light with the sun and moon, one attains eternal vision. When all things transform while I alone remain, this is called the Dao.

The *Cushioned Explanation* states: There are beings, and there are beings that give rise to all things. The former are things; the latter is the Dao. The text says: *"The named is the mother of all things."* Zhuangzi said: *"All things flourish and grow from non-action."* Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring.

There are forms, and there are forms that give rise to forms. Forms are the physical; forms that give rise to forms are *nature* (性). Zhuangzi said: *"Nature is the essence of life."* Liuzi said: *"Form is the vessel of life."* Thus, *nature* is the root of form, and form is its foundation.

The mother of having a kingdom is the one who knows its offspring and guards its mother. Guarding its mother means uniting with the Dao, enduring through all ages and remaining constant. Thus, one will not perish in life and can endure forever.

Now, take the growth of grasses and trees: deep roots secure their foundations, just as in humans, restoring *nature* preserves form. Only by preserving form can one ensure life’s vitality without exhaustion, like grasses and trees rooted in the earth, enduring without end. Thus, aligned with Heaven and Earth, one attains eternal life, and wisdom never ceases, like the sun and moon sharing their light, one attains eternal vision.

When all things transform while I alone remain, this is to transcend form and not transform with it, to depart from fate and not perish with it—this is called the Dao.

Chapter Sixty of *The Great Learning* (《记》):
To govern a great kingdom, one must act as if cooking a small fish.」

「Huizong’s annotation states: When dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them, success will be rare. When storing great treasures and frequently moving them, many will be damaged. When cooking a small fish and constantly stirring it, it will be ruined. When ruling a great state and frequently altering its laws, confusion will arise. Therefore, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle.

The *Cushui* commentary explains: If a ruler favors strictness, all affairs will be meticulous; if he favors meticulousness, all affairs will become chaotic. Hence, the ruler’s Dao lies in governing with singular focus—if he knows how to govern one thing properly, then all other matters will follow in order. Thus, it is natural that dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them yields little success, and storing great treasures while frequently moving them leads to many damages.

Indeed, the world has its fixed ways: to follow them brings order, to disrupt them brings worry. Only by not disrupting Heaven’s natural course and not opposing the inclinations of things can one establish laws that are firm and unchanging, avoiding the flaw of issuing morning decrees and evening reversals. Then, the world will be well-governed. Just as with cooking fish—if one constantly stirs it, it will spoil—so too, ruling a great state by frequently altering its laws will surely bring confusion.

*The Classic of Transmission* says: If the people trust in their laws, they will be obedient. This is the virtue of ancient sages in lawmaking: their decrees were steadfast as metal and stone, reliable as the four seasons, and never changed.

Therefore, by remaining unadulterated and clear, embracing the Way with tranquility, the people will have no need for governance and will settle naturally. Hence, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle. Who would willingly multiply laws and edicts to burden the masses?

Those who govern the world with the Way, their spirits are not malevolent. Huizong’s annotation states: The sage is the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. When compelled to govern the world, the best course is *wuwei* (non-action). The Way is ever in non-action, yet through non-action, all things are governed. Those who rely on others to act will also find stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune, hence it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.

The *Cushui* commentary explains: The *Book of Poetry* says, *"A hundred spirits obey you."* The *Book of Documents* says, *"Only the primordial sovereign acts as parent and mother to the people."* Zhuangzi says, *"The sage is the pivot upon which all things hinge."* Thus, the sage is indeed the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. Yet, it is easy for me to forget the world, but difficult for the world to forget me. The reason the sage emerges to guide the world is but a dwelling in necessity, a temporary abode.

When compelled to govern the world, what else is there to do but maintain reverence and uprightness? Then, through non-action alone, the people’s lives will be at peace, and they will transform naturally. Thus, none will remain ungoverned. Those who rely on others to act and yet claim to be the Way’s sovereign will find their own support and ease, all settling into stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *"The ancestral spirits come to rest, their fragrance lingering."* Hence, it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.

It is not that their spirits are not malevolent, but that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. It is not that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm the people. When the two do not harm each other, their virtue reciprocally returns.

Huizong’s annotation states: Those who govern the world with the Way do nothing yet everything is naturally so—there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter. This is what is meant by "not harming the people."

In such times, the Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and virtue reciprocally returns. The Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, hence it is said that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—how could there be any harm?

The *Cushui* commentary explains: The Way is ever in non-action yet accomplishes all. If one governs the world with the Way, one follows its inherent nature without imposing artificial disruptions—this is what is meant by *"doing nothing yet everything is naturally so."* Protecting the people as a father, viewing them as a mother, never resorting to arms—thus there is no calamity of war. Punishments are set aside and unused—thus there are no executions. The Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and the bright are without human censure, the hidden without ghostly blame. Then virtue reciprocally returns, for the Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, as the *Book of Poetry* says, *"The Way’s spirit descends in sorrow."* The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *"The people are simple."* How could there be any harm?

Chapter Sixty-One of *The Classic of Transmission*:
Great states are the lower reaches of the rivers...」

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"No one lacks the inclination toward the high, yet those who pursue the high often stumble."* The rivers and seas become the sovereigns of all valleys because they excel in yielding. The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *"A nine-tiered tower begins with piled earth; to ascend high, one must start from below. Knowing that the high depends on the low as its foundation, one avoids stumbling by not elevating without a base."* Merely desiring the high while neglecting the low is to love the high without attaining it—how could one not stumble?

Water does not accumulate without forming depths; rivers and seas become great by receiving all streams. Thus, they reign over all valleys, and waters pay homage to them because they excel in yielding. Then, is it not the case that a state’s greatness lies in its yielding, and its governance follows accordingly?

The meeting place of all under Heaven, the feminine of all under Heaven—
the feminine always overcomes the masculine through stillness,
and stillness is the way of yielding.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"While all others rely on strength to contend, I alone dwell in the realm of gentle stillness and non-contention—who then can overcome me?"* This is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven."*

The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *"From the perspective of things, only the low can support, only the yielding can prevail. This is the inherent principle: those who rely on fierceness and exploit others, thinking to rise above, merely court ruin. The constant way of victory lies in yielding; the constant way of defeat lies in rigidity."*

All under Heaven rely on strength to contend, yet the Sage adopts weakness, humility, and yielding as his standard. Dwelling in stillness and non-contention, he retreats only to lead, withdraws only to endure. Though he does not seek to overcome others, none can overcome him—this is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven."* Indeed, knowing the way to overcome, yet dwelling in yielding stillness, all things must yield to it—because of its stillness.

Thus, when great states yield to small states, they take the small states;
when small states yield to great states, they take the great states.
Hence, sometimes one yields to take, sometimes one yields and takes.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"To gather, one must first disperse; to take, one must first give."*

The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *"There is contraction and expansion, fullness and emptiness—this is not only human affairs but the natural order of Heaven. Only those who perceive these subtle shifts beforehand know that to gather, one must first disperse, understanding that contraction and expansion mutually consume each other; to take, one must first give, knowing that fullness and emptiness follow as beginning and end."*

Thus, great states yield to small states with the affairs of greatness, and small states yield to great states with the affairs of smallness—each attains what it desires. Then, to rise above others, one must speak of yielding, yet the gentleman does not wish to rise above many—precisely for this reason.

Great states seek only to nurture others, small states seek only to serve others—both attain what they desire, hence the great should yield.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Dao of Heaven is yielding yet illuminates all; thus it treads without failing. The Dao of Earth is low yet ascends; thus it sustains Heaven."* Human affairs follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven—hence the great should yield.

The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *"The Dao of Heaven yields yet nourishes all, its light covering without bound. The Dao of Earth is low yet ascends, sustaining the seasons of Heaven."* Practicing the way of humility and openness, even Heaven and Earth do so—how much more so for humanity? Emperor Yao shone with sincere reverence, his virtue reaching to the four quarters; Emperor Shun ascended with gentle humility, his profound virtue heard in Heaven. All this is but following the ways of Heaven and Earth.

The Three Powers occupy distinct positions, yet their ways are one—
thus the Sage does not exalt himself, following Earth,
and so achieves effortless success for all under Heaven.
Earth does not exalt itself, following Heaven,
and so nurtures all things without striving.
Thus, not exalting oneself is the way to achieve greatness—
this is the constant truth.

Hence, the great should yield—is it not so?

*The Commentary on the Dao De Jing* concludes, Volume Eleven.
*The Commentary on the Dao De Jing* begins, Volume Twelve.

**The Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Chapter Sixty-Two: *The Dao as the Hidden Essence of All Things***

The Dao is the hidden essence of all things.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
The hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.
The hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.
The hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.

Heaven, Earth, and humanity each possess their hidden essences, yet all are encompassed by the Dao.

The Dao is difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure, and difficult to recognize—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.

If the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then are not all things the manifest expression of the Dao?

*The Commentary* states:
The Dao’s hidden nature is unfathomably deep—like the innermost chamber of a hall, sealed in profound secrecy, or like the depths of the Qi River, concealed and locked away. All that is perverse and manifest yet enters into concealment possesses its hidden essence. In the *Taiyuan* [section], the Three Models are discussed precisely to speak of their hidden depths.

Heaven’s hidden essence lies in the unseen—its west-north corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram, returning to the utmost stillness, where the vital essence condenses. When the vital essence condenses, the movement of *qi* becomes subtle and concealed; when the sun meets the moon, it is obscured—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.*

Earth’s hidden essence lies in the formless—its Yellow Springs are unfathomably deep, plunged into the utmost darkness, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves. When the spirit-forms conceal themselves, the *yang* energy germinates in secret, hiding its form—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.*

Humanity’s hidden essence lies in the heart and abdomen—thought and deliberation reside within humanity, bending and rising to embrace the four seas, drifting yet weaving through all directions, where the supreme spirit is nurtured. When the supreme spirit is nurtured, it becomes wondrous and boundless, beyond measure—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.*

The Three Powers occupy distinct positions, yet each has its hidden essence. Though Heaven possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Heaven; though Earth possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Earth; though humanity possesses its hidden essence, humanity abides within the Dao. Thus all are encompassed by the Dao—because the Dao cannot be sought through form or number.

The Three Powers have not yet departed from form and number, yet the Dao cannot be sought through form and number. It may be called difficult to exhaust and difficult to fathom, yet it has never been confined; difficult to measure and difficult to recognize, yet its mysteries cannot be glimpsed.

The virtuous lend and yet fulfill—its transformation is subtle and profound. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao is nameless, nourishing all things—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.

If the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then from the nonexistent arises the existent, and all things, though manifest, cannot evade it—are they not the manifest expression of the Dao?

**The Treasure of the Virtuous Person**

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
To practice virtue is to accumulate goodness until nature is perfected, and the divine clarity is naturally attained. The Sage follows this path.

*The Commentary* states:
There are those who treasure material things—jewels and jade, as spoken of in the *Transmissions*.
There are those who treasure the Dao—such as this statement on the treasure of the virtuous person.

The virtuous person does not treasure material things; their treasure lies in the Dao. Thus, from humanity they ascend to Heaven, from virtue they reach sainthood, and without entering they attain self-possession.

For the Dao is the interplay of *yin* and *yang*. What follows it is virtue; what fulfills it is nature. The virtuous person knows that virtue arises from the Dao and is perfected in nature, and thus their unadorned simplicity can be practiced and realized.

When practiced, it becomes boundless in its goodness, and in its realization, it never falters. Able to exhaust their nature, they can assist in the transformation and nourishment of all things, aligning with the divine.

From the accumulation of desired goodness to the fulfillment of perfect beauty—this is the accumulation of virtue into nature.
From the radiance of great progress to the attainment of the ineffable divine—this is the divine clarity naturally attained.

If the Sage’s heart follows this path, then they do not stray from the Dao.

What treasure can surpass this?

**What the Non-Virtuous Preserve**

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
To act contrary to the Dao is to invite harm; to follow its principles is to remain whole. To act without restraint is to invite perversity; to still one’s nature is to remain upright—thus one can preserve the body.

*The Commentary* states:
The Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all things.
If one acts contrary to its all-encompassing nature, there will be no harm.
If one acts without restraint, there will be no perversity.

To act contrary to the Dao without harm—one must abandon cleverness and artifice, follow its principles without deviation, and thus guard their wholeness, so that nothing can harm them. This is called *sincerity made whole and returned to its origin.*

To act without restraint yet remain upright—one must preserve their true nature in emptiness, still their essence without disturbance, and thus attain their uprightness, so that perversity cannot enter. This is called *the four extremes undisturbed, the heart then upright.*

To follow its principles and remain whole, to still one’s nature and remain upright—no matter what the world offers, it cannot exchange their守. Thus they can preserve their body without fear of ruin, and this is as it should be.

The *Yijing* says: *To exhaust principle, to exhaust nature, and thus to attain fate.*
To follow its principles is to exhaust principle;
To exhaust one’s nature is to exhaust nature;
To preserve the body is to attain fate.

What the non-virtuous preserve is no different from this.

Fine words can be sold in the market,
Noble deeds can be bestowed upon others.
What is there to abandon in humanity’s failings?

Emperor Huizong’s annotation:
Words are like waves—deeds are like the loss of substance.
Neither is what the Dao values.

When words are beautiful and pleasing, when deeds are noble and worthy of emulation, they can still be sold in the market, or bestowed upon others, and people will submit to them. How much more so when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence, encompassing all without distinction?

Thus, what is there to abandon in humanity’s failings?

*The Commentary* states:
The heart, when dwelling in emptiness and stillness, is virtuous. When it manifests in speech, it becomes the waves of wind—when it ceases, it becomes substance, and when it appears in action, it becomes the loss of substance.

Words are like waves—deeds are like the loss of substance.
Both are lost in superficiality and are not what the Dao values.

Yet when speech is harmonious and the people are content, then beautiful words that please are still sufficient to—

「Reverence, caution, awe, and propriety—these are the norms for the people. When actions are noble and worthy of emulation, they are still sufficient to bestow upon others, and how much more so when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence?

Only when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence does one nurture and manifest the myriad transformations, encompass all wonders, move like the heavens in their operation—covering all without partiality—and hold like the sea in its capacity—containing all without omission. Though they may appear diverse and conflicting, all converge in the singular principle of the Dao. What then is there to distinguish?

Thus, what is there to abandon in humanity’s imperfections?

*The Classic of Poetry* says:
*"Is this not my great sage?*
*What is there in others that he does not embrace?"*

Therefore, only those who embody the Dao’s hidden essence can truly fulfill the universal principle of inclusivity. Hence, establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers—though they may offer jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy—is not as effective as simply cultivating this Dao to refine oneself. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:
*"The virtue of a gentleman lies in cultivating his own person to achieve peace in the realm. The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers, though they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to summon the worthy and gain their service, fail to prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves. Thus, they forsake themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance. ‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means seeking virtue within oneself alone. Where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace."*

*The Commentary* states:
*"Though the world is vast, governance lies in the Dao; though the four seas are distant, governance lies in the heart. What is the greatest of guardianship? Guardianship of one’s person is greatest. When that which is guarded is most refined, then its application becomes most expansive. The ancients who spoke of governance began with self-discipline, their thoughts reaching far even in proximity. This is achieved through the cultivation of one’s own person. As for governing the realm, it is because the gentleman’s self-cultivation brings peace to the world. Though the Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers are esteemed for their rank, if they govern the people through the Dao, the realm will naturally submit. Even if they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy and gain their service, making them a glory for the state, yet they do not prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves, they cannot maintain true guardianship. Without true guardianship, they abandon themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance.*

*Yangzi said: ‘First govern oneself, then govern others—that is the mark of a great vessel.’*
*‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means prioritizing self-governance.*

*What is called self-governance is not external influence; it is seeking within oneself alone. If one seeks within oneself alone, then the use of others is but an extension of oneself. In ancient times, Emperor Yao achieved clarity and virtue, bringing the common folk to harmony in times of change. King Wen of Zhou was born with sagely wisdom, ascending to the shore of governance and ruling his state with ease. Each attained this through the same means.*

*Though the Dao’s true essence lies in self-cultivation, its subtle extensions govern the state, and its fundamental principles govern the world—yet the key is to understand the Dao. Hence, where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace. The Sage is the parent of the people. When the Sage holds the Dao in reverence above, the people follow it below. If they grasp the Dao with the tenacity of a dog or the steadfastness of an elephant, will not the world turn toward them? Why was this Dao so esteemed in antiquity? Was it not because one seeks and attains it, and even the guilty are absolved? Hence, it is most precious for the world.*

*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*
*‘To seek is to attain—this seeking is within oneself.’*
*Ancient people sought the Dao in the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate, yet did not attain it. This was because they sought externally. Can the malevolent be transformed into the virtuous, and the foolish into the wise? This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent teachings are such, hence its preciousness for the world.*

*The Classic of Changes says:*
*‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao.’*
*The Commentary states:*
*‘The heart is the sovereign of the Dao, so the Dao is never separate from me. The Dao cannot be sought through emotions, so it is never obstructed by external things. Since the Dao is never separate from me, one must seek it within oneself to attain true attainment—because seeking lies within me. Since the Dao is never obstructed by external things, one must seek it through the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate. Seeking it for five years without attaining it, seeking it through yin and yang for twelve years without attaining it—this is because seeking lies externally. Seeking within oneself is beneficial for attainment; seeking externally is not. Thus, those who seek but do not attain do so because the Dao is near, yet they seek it far. But the virtuous seek and attain it by seeking within themselves alone. The Dao within oneself contains all beauties; people only suffer from not seeking it. If one truly aligns the heart with the Dao, then the malevolent can be transformed into the virtuous, virtue cultivated unconsciously, and there will be no fault of misconduct. The foolish can become wise, understanding the principles and awakening to them, without the confusion of divergent paths. This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent salvation of humanity is such, hence it cannot be cheapened—it is most precious for the world. ‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao’ means it is not esteemed by external titles, yet its natural reverence is ever-present.*

**Chapter Sixty-Three: On Non-Action**
*To practice non-action (wuwei), to act without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), to savor without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei).*

*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*
*The Dao’s essence is without fabrication, hence non-action (wuwei); without form, hence without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi); without desire, hence without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei). The Sage responds to things as they are, yet embodies the Dao’s essence of non-fabrication in these three aspects.*

*The Commentary states:*
*The Dao’s subtlety lies in its non-existence; it cannot be sought through physical form. Yet when speaking of its grand completeness, we provisionally call it ‘essence.’ What is called the Dao’s essence is like Zhuangzi’s description of the ancient people’s great framework. Since the Dao’s essence is subtly non-existent, its stillness and motionlessness are non-fabrication (wuzuo). Non-fabrication means non-action (wuwei), and non-action means the utmost action is without fabrication. The formless form is without clinging to form (wuxiang). Without clinging to form means without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), and without clinging to action means no burden of fabrication or action. The tranquil sufficiency is without desire (wuyu). Without desire means without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei), and without attachment to flavor means those who crave flavor have never truly presented themselves."*

「Engaging in affairs and undertaking deeds—though they are accomplished, they are said to be "action," yet their origin lies in *wuwei* [non-action].
The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth each have their functions—though they manifest form, their operations arise from *wushì* [non-affairs].
The taste of the river is universally desired—though it is called "desire," its essence comes from *wuwèi* [non-flavor].
Thus, one sees how the marvelous application of the Dao unfolds.

The Sage embodies the true *wu* [non-being] while perpetually manifesting *you* [being], and manifests the marvelous *yòng* [function] while perpetually returning to *wu* [non-being].
Therefore, in responding to the *you* of things, it is as if the *wu* naturally transforms into *you*.
In embodying the *wu* of the Dao, it reaches the utmost *wu* to fulfill its *you*.
Through these three aspects, the Dao’s essence and function are indeed manifest.

**Great and small, much and little:**
Huizong’s annotation: "Great and small" refers to form, "much and little" to quantity. The measure of things is boundless, beyond enumeration.
If something is great yet not excessive, small yet not deficient, then the distinctions between resentment and gratitude—who can discern them?

The Sage unifies all things in the One *wu*, thus achieving the utmost greatness.
The *Cushui* explains:
From the perspective of things, they appear in diverse forms—whether the void or the great marsh, the minutest hair or a horse’s body—differing in shape and confined by form, varying in number and constrained by quantity.
From the perspective of the Dao, all things are one. Though the Northern Sea is vast, it is unknown whether it is "great yet not excessive"; though the Jīng River’s flow is small, it is unknown whether it is "small yet not deficient." Since the measure of things is boundless, it cannot be enumerated.
Thus, resentment may have its distinctions, but gratitude arises from the heart. Though these two may be instruments of rectification, they are not the Dao of rectification itself.
Acting without expectation of return, the Sage harmonizes with all things—how then can distinctions be seen?

The Sage, through the emptiness of the Dao, receives all the manifold realities of the world, never causing harm to others, never hoarding benevolence and grace. Thus, unifying all things in the One *wu*, gathering all smallness into unity, achieving the utmost greatness—spanning heaven and earth, vast beyond containment.
Therefore, the Emperor and King take heaven and earth as their ancestral model, and this is the pinnacle of the central realm.

**Repaying resentment with virtue:**
Huizong’s annotation: Titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents—then what resentment remains? What is valued is virtue alone.
The *Cushui* explains:
One who embodies complete virtue gains the world’s praise yet remains indifferent, unaffected by the rewards of crowns and honors—thus, titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives.
One who embodies complete virtue faces the world’s censure yet remains unshaken, fearing neither the executioner’s axe nor the blade—thus, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents.
When honor and disgrace arise, they neither benefit nor harm their true nature. Thus, distinctions of right and wrong cannot be divided, and distinctions of greatness and smallness cannot be enumerated. At the utmost division, there is ultimately no division—then what resentment remains?
Only one of supreme virtue can achieve this. Thus, what is truly valued is virtue alone.

For the Yang is virtue, the Yin is resentment. Repaying resentment with virtue means merging into the indistinct, flowing without obstruction—this is called "responding to resentment without resentment," and it is the highest expression of virtue.

**Addressing difficulties in their ease, achieving greatness in the minute:**
The world’s difficult matters must begin in ease, the world’s great affairs must begin in the minute.
Huizong’s annotation:
A thousand-zhang dike collapses from the burrow of an ant;
A hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.
White Gui’s dike-walking seals the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.
The aged man’s fire-watching seals the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.
Worldly affairs always originate in the most trivial matters, and by the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter—thus, the Sage acts early.

The *Cushui* explains:
*The Classic* says, "Do not let it spread," for once it spreads, it is difficult to counter—thus, those who plan far ahead do not neglect what is easy.
*The Scripture* says, "Do it before it exists," for those who know the few must examine what is minute.
A thousand-zhang dike may be called a river’s defense, yet if the ant’s burrow—though small—is not stopped, the trickle will not be dammed, and it will become a river.
A hundred-foot hall may be called a secure dwelling, yet if the crack’s smoke—though faint—is not heeded, the flicker will not be extinguished, and the flames will rage—what then?
White Gui’s dike-walking must seal the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.
The aged man’s fire-watching must seal the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.
Yet the enlightened sage acts brilliantly in the fleeting and subtle, applying wisdom before matters become overwhelming. Each time this is observed, it echoes Han Fei’s teachings.

Thus, it is seen: the world’s affairs always originate in the most trivial matters.
*The Odes* say, "On auspicious days, be cautious of the minute," because affairs arise from the most trivial matters.
By the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter.
*The Changes* say, "In anticipating calamities, take preventive measures," because their end is difficult to counter.
The Sage’s wisdom penetrates to the divine, and thus acts early—knowing this alone. This aligns with the Master’s saying, "Planning ahead in advance is called foresight."

Thus, the Sage never seeks the great directly, and so achieves the utmost greatness.
Huizong’s annotation: "Acting in the small, thus achieving the great."
The *Cushui* explains:
When the earth is but a clod, it becomes a field;
When water is but a ladleful, it becomes a river.
Thus, acting in the small allows one to achieve the great—this is the natural order.
The Sage deliberates in undertaking affairs, ensuring each success, thus bringing about great governance—also by acting in the small.

*The Odes* praise the governance of Wen and Wu, accumulating the *Xiao Ya* to form the *Da Ya*—its beginning was small, its accomplishment great, thus achieving internal and external governance, beginning with diligent concern.

Thus, if one waits until chaos has already taken form before seeking to govern it, is this not too late?

Mencius cited *The Odes: Owl* (《鸱鸮》) to say:
*"Before the heavens darken with rain, mend the thatched doors and windows of the mulberry grove.*
*This is to make known the state’s policies and laws when there is still leisure—*
*seeking to govern before the crisis arises.*
*How could it compare to waiting for the great cold before seeking warm garments?"*

Thus, the Sage takes this poem as the *Dao/Way* of foresight.

Therefore, the affairs of the world—what seems small can be done, and what seems great cannot be undone once neglected.

He who makes light of promises will lack trustworthiness; he who undertakes many things lightly will face many difficulties. Hence, the Sage proceeds with caution, and thus ultimately faces no difficulties.

Huizong’s annotation:
*"Calamity is often hidden in the subtle, erupting when people overlook it.*
*The Sage’s response to the world is always to be vigilant in the subtle and never negligent,*
*so there is never any reckless action,*
*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*
*This is all in accordance with the principle of *wu* (無)—non-doing, non-action."*

The *Cushui* explains:
*"Fire arises from wood; if the disaster is inevitable, then calamity is indeed hidden in the subtle.*
*If one treats it lightly, it is unwise, and thus calamity erupts when people overlook it.*
*Mencius said that blessings and misfortunes are all self-sought—*
*this is to say, do not neglect the subtle.*

*The Sage’s response to the world is to share in the people’s afflictions.*
*His wisdom suffices to comprehend the principles of things,*
*his foresight suffices to perceive omens early,*
*and he deliberates before signs appear,*
*always cautious in the subtle, considering beginnings with the same care as endings,*
*and never overlooking what others neglect.*
*Thus, there is never any reckless action,*
*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*

*The Records* say:
*'Better to have one’s own grudges than to break a promise without cause.'*
*Without reckless promises, words will align with actions.*

*The Commentaries* say:
*'If one deems it easy, difficulty will soon follow.'*
*Without undertaking many things lightly, every action will lead to auspicious outcomes.*

*Thus, navigating the world with this approach—*
*adapting flexibly and appropriately—*
*one will ultimately face no difficulties.*

*Yet this is not because one delights in omniscience,*
*but because one embodies the *wu* of *wuwei*—*
*non-action, non-taste,*
*the *Dao/Way* of nothingness.*

*Where the *Dao/Way* resides, who can pose difficulty?*
*The final stanza of *The Teal and Heron* speaks of no future calamity—*
*this aligns with the same meaning.*

*Chapter Sixty-Four of *The Ease of Holding Firm*:*
*'What is firm is easy to hold,*
*what is yet unmanifest is easy to plan,*
*what is fragile is easy to dissolve,*
*what is subtle is easy to disperse.*
*Act before it exists,*
*govern before it is disordered.*

Huizong’s annotation:
*'Firmness is the opposite of danger,*
*the unmanifest is the opposite of what is already formed,*
*the fragile is the opposite of hardness,*
*the subtle is the opposite of what is manifest.*
*To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*
*to plan before the unmanifest is to prevent its formation.*

*The Sage’s foresight—*
*to dissolve fragility before it hardens,*
*to disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*
*this is the near-miss of the worthy.*

*Chariots racing on steep paths,*
*boats navigating treacherous currents—*
*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*
*Cleverness is applied before the race or the sinking,*
*this is what is meant by*
*'acting before it exists,*
*governing before it is disordered.'*

The *Cushui* explains:
*'Matters hidden in non-existence all follow natural principles;*
*once they manifest, they all follow inevitable mechanisms.*
*The principles are deeply hidden—*
*only the most divine can penetrate them;*
*the mechanisms are subtly triggered—*
*only the most wise can foresee them.*

*'Firmness is the opposite of danger—*
*where there is firmness, there must be danger.*
*The unmanifest is the opposite of what is formed—*
*if unmanifest, its form will vanish,*
*this is the principle of non-existence.*
*The fragile is the opposite of hardness—*
*hardness has already taken its substance.*
*The subtle is the opposite of what is manifest—*
*manifestation has already revealed its beginning,*
*this is the reality of existence.*

*'To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*
*thus one can preserve the state.*
*To plan before the unmanifest is to prevent calamity.*

*The Sage’s foresight—*
*is it not divine?*
*Knowing the subtle and the manifest,*
*acting clearly in the fleeting and obscure,*
*divine insight into the future.*

*To dissolve fragility before it hardens—*
*this is why one must be cautious at the first frost.*
*To disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*
*this is why one must examine the minutest details.*

*The worthy’s near-miss—*
*their wisdom, though not divine,*
*is close to perfection when reflecting,*
*and does not stray when erring,*
*discerning early what the wise later grasp.*

*Indeed, omens are the subtle movements,*
*the precursors of auspiciousness.*
*Seeing the second line of *Yù* (《豫》):*
*'In accordance with principle, one awakens—*
*this is the Sage’s foresight.'*

*The first line of *Fù* (《复》):*
*'Form takes shape, then one awakens—*
*this is the worthy’s near-miss.'*

*Only because they know omens*
*do they not ultimately say, 'This is auspicious.'*
*Only because they nearly miss*
*do they have no regret,*
*and thus how could there be calamities of racing chariots or sinking boats?*

*Indeed, chariots are for ascending steep paths,*
*boats are for crossing difficulties—*
*racing chariots, sinking boats,*
*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*

*Yang Xiong, in response to a question,*
*spoke of applying cleverness before the race or sinking.*

*Thus, to act before it exists,*
*to govern before it is disordered—*
*this brings ultimate safety,*
*surpassing even the most perilous paths or the need for oars.*

*A tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout;*
*a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;*
*a thousand-*li journey begins beneath one’s feet.*

Huizong’s annotation:
*'All formed things—*
*the great must grow from the small,*
*the high must be founded on the low,*
*the distant must begin near.*
*What is simple in its beginning*
*will inevitably become vast in its completion.*

*The Sage, seeing the beginning, contemplates the end,*
*observing the finger, knows the path.*
*Thus, he does not become the first to invite blessings,*
*nor the first to invite calamity.*
*He deliberates before undertaking affairs,*
*ensuring each success.'*

The *Cushui* explains:
*'What is formed arises from what is formless;*
*all that is constrained by form*
*must progress from the subtle to the manifest—*
*thus, the great must grow from the small.*

*To seek the axe’s handle,*
*one must begin with the uncut millimeter;*
*that a tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout is evident."*

If ascending must begin from below,
then the high must indeed be founded on the low.
Lofty mountains rise from the unceasing accumulation of soil—
a nine-tiered terrace begins with the same.
From near to far, then the distant must begin near.
To reach a thousand *li*, one accumulates at every step without pause—
a thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.

These three truths:
Their beginnings are simple,
their origins small,
yet their completion is vast,
their end great—
such is their nature.

All things have a root and branch,
all affairs have an end and a beginning.
The Sage, seeing the beginning, contemplates the end,
thus seeking its ultimate fulfillment;
observing the finger, he knows its path,
thus grasping its destined course.

Contemplating near and far,
in silence aligning with the Way,
he does not become the first to invite blessings—
for blessings do not then come—
nor the first to invite calamity—
for calamities do not then arrive.
He acts in accordance with the time,
moves in harmony with the Way,
deliberates before undertaking affairs,
and ensures each success—
responding only to what is felt.

When the affairs of the world press upon him,
and he might decline them without action,
even the most trivial matters contain what must be done—
yet to do them when they are easy?
He must first deliberate before acting,
lest he act only when it is no longer easy.

Only by not acting when it is easy
do the affairs he undertakes
inevitably achieve completion—
truly, his successes are grand!

To act is to court failure;
to grasp is to court loss.
Thus the Sage does nothing,
and so knows no failure;
he does not grasp,
and so knows no loss.

*The Cushui* explains:
The Sage does not engage in affairs,
and so knows no failure.
He does not cling to fixed ways,
and so knows no loss.
The ignorant, however, set measures and cling to them,
ever drifting farther from the Way—
how could they avoid failure and loss?

The principles of the world
may be followed, not forced;
trusted, not seized.
To act seeking completion
is to ensure failure;
to grasp seeking possession
is to ensure loss.

The Sage embodies the Way’s emptiness,
remaining still and doing nothing—
not engaging in affairs,
thus bearing no responsibility for action,
and so knows no failure.
He adapts without clinging,
not holding fast to old ways—
thus bearing no burden of past actions,
and so knows no loss.

Yet the ignorant do not know
that time never stops,
that circumstances never remain fixed—
they set measures and cling to them,
blinded by one perspective,
unaware of the whole.
How different is this from carving a boat to seek a sword,
or gluing a pillar to tune a zither?
No wonder they drift ever farther from the Way,
unable to embrace change—
how few escape failure and loss!

Thus the common folk,
when nearly complete in their endeavors,
often fail.
*The Cushui* explains:
To halt midway is to never reach the peak;
to abandon halfway is to never find the path.
Though they begin with diligence,
they end in slackness—
this is the nature of the common heart,
and so their affairs often fail just as they near completion.

*The Commentary* says:
*"He who can reach the hill with his feet*
*must follow the path to its end—*
*to halt midway is to reach nothing.*
*Though the road be winding, it leads to all under Heaven—*
*to abandon it halfway is to find no destination."*

Confucius spoke of *"what I do not do for myself,"*
meaning this very truth—
not only for learning,
but for all undertakings.
If their resolve falters in what they guard,
if their strength wears in what they pursue,
beginning with diligence but ending in slackness,
how could their affairs succeed?

At first, they take joy in fleeting moments,
yet soon grow weary of endurance—
the common heart is easily swayed by things.
To begin with vigor and end in neglect
is the way of all the common folk.
Only by stopping not to advance,
abandoning halfway to draw their own limits,
do their affairs often fail just as they near completion.

Mencius sighed for those who act,
comparing them to one who digs a well nine *ren* deep
yet never reaches the spring.
To treat the end as carefully as the beginning
is to know no failure in affairs.

*The Cushui* explains:
*"None begin without end,*
*few complete what they start.*
*To make the end like the beginning,*
*time itself renews—*
*what affair, thus treated, would not succeed?"*

*The Commentary* says:
King Cheng admonished his ministers,
saying, *"Let your ambition be as vast as your resolve,*
*your deeds as broad as your actions."*
This means:
Within, exhaust your heart—this is resolve;
without, exhaust your strength—this is diligence.
*"None begin without end,*
*few complete what they start,"*
for when the heart grows slack
and strength grows weary,
how could one not tire before completion?

Yi Yin said:
*"To make the end like the beginning,*
*time itself renews—*
*thus, with unceasing sincerity,*
*one attends to its ultimate fulfillment.*
*To let time renew itself,*
*one acts without weariness,*
*even in rest, never resting."*

Applying this to affairs,
they must be brought to order before ceasing—
what undertaking, thus treated, would not succeed?
This is what is meant by:
*"To treat the end as carefully as the beginning*
*is to know no failure in affairs."*

*The Classic* says:
*"Only the Sage has both beginning and end."*
Thus the Sage desires not to desire,
values not the hard-to-obtain treasures;
learns not to learn,
restoring what others have overstepped.

*The Cushui* explains:
Those who desire profit
exchange themselves for things,
drowning in worldly pursuits.
Those who pursue learning
drown in endless knowledge,
losing its true path.
How could this lead to *wuwei*?

The Sage does not burden himself with profit,
desiring only not to desire—
nurturing self and others equally,
stopping only when fully nourished,
thus not valuing hard-to-obtain treasures,
not letting others extinguish the Way.

Learning lies in not learning,
merely weaving and brightening the light—
thus restoring what others have overstepped.
When the Way is obscured,
even the worthy err—
how much more the common folk?
To restore their errors and return to nature
is how the absolute learner knows no worry,
only joy.

*The Commentary* says:
Zhuangzi spoke of those who indulge in wealth and honor,
exchanging themselves for things,
thus lost in worldly song.
Liezi warned that scholars perish through endless pursuits,
drowning in knowledge without foundation.

「Is it not sufficient to attain *wuwei*?

The so-called *wuwei* holds nothing dearer than *xu* [emptiness], nothing more skillful than *jing* [stillness], and nothing else.

To exchange oneself for things is to lose oneself in them—
already galloping with the restless, one does not know
that stillness lies in motion itself.

To drown oneself in knowledge is to make the heart
branched and doubtful—
already obstructed by the concrete, one does not know
that diminishing the concrete brings *xu* [emptiness].

Thus, it is not sufficient to attain *wuwei*.

The Sage does not act so.

He does not burden his form with profit,
for his seeking lies within—
what he desires is internal, not external,
and desire arises from *not* desiring.

To share profit brings delight,
to share sustenance brings ease—
not clinging to the gains of one age as private possession,
but ensuring all under heaven are nourished,
which aligns with Zhuangzi’s words:
*"nurturing self and others equally,
stopping only when fully nourished."*

Thus, he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures,
nor let others extinguish the Way—
he simply abandons human contrivance.

What he learns lies in the heart,
not in external pursuit,
and learning is in *not* learning.

Following nature’s inherent course,
practicing until mastery,
he does not augment true virtue with fragmented schemes,
but aims for morning clarity to behold the singular—
this is what the *Shijing* [Book of Songs] calls
*"learning lies in weaving and brightening the light"*—
thus restoring what others have overstepped.

For those who exhaust skill and seek rare treasures,
these are the hard-to-obtain things.
The Sage does not value them,
for he wishes the people not to stray after things—
thus can it be said:
*"I have no desires, yet the people find sufficiency."*

To abandon the root and chase the superficial
is the error of the common folk.
The Sage restores their errors,
not to punish them but to return them to the Way—
thus can it be said:
*"He is always good at saving people,
yet never abandons them."*

For the Way, when obscured,
even the worthy err—
the wise among the worthy still have their *guo* [oversteps],
how much more the common folk?

To restore their errors and return them to nature
is how the heart is cultivated and virtue is restored,
virtue reaches perfection and aligns with its original state,
approaching the vision of the Dao and transcending learning—
abiding in nature’s inherent course,
without fixed purpose yet ever joyful,
this is how the absolute learner knows no worry.

If the son of Yan [Preyan] discards *renyi* [benevolence and righteousness], *gongyue* [rites and music],
yet finds joy in his *danpiao* [coarse meal and gourd], *zhuoru* [wild plants and coarse rice],
is this not akin to the Sage’s joy in forgetting worries?

To aid the natural unfolding of all things,
yet not dare to act.

*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:
*"Heaven is high, earth is low,
all things are dispersed and distinct—
how could one force them?
Their growth and change are nature’s own.
To aid their natural unfolding,
is how their nature is perfected.
To act is to ruin them—
thus the Sage does not dare to act.
This is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,
not on clever schemes."*

*The Commentary* says:
*"Heaven moves above,
not creating yet transforming,
earth rests below,
not growing yet nurturing—
all things flourish between heaven and earth,
like motion or stillness,
sprouting in varied forms—
this is what is meant by
*‘Heaven is high, earth is low,
all things are dispersed and distinct.’*

The Sage praises heaven and earth’s transformation and nurturing,
and all things that follow their Way—
how could one force them?
Their birth, growth, and change in form and color,
their intelligence and capabilities waxing or waning—
these are nature’s own.
To aid their natural unfolding,
is not to promote their growth,
nor to urge their completion,
but to let them be as they are,
entrusting them to their own course—
thus their nature is perfected.

Yet heaven acts without action and remains clear,
earth acts without action and remains tranquil,
all things follow their roles—
each thrives from *wuwei* [non-action],
so what aids their nature
is not by human force or cleverness?

To act is to ruin them,
and even worse, to invite the loss of *zhong* [augmentation].
Thus the Sage does not dare to act.
This is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,
not on clever schemes.

Relying on Dao/Way’s transformation,
he follows things’ natural course without private favor—
not clinging to cleverness,
he discards knowledge and habit,
conforming to heaven’s principles—
thus, without action, all things transform.

As for those who carve *zhu* [bamboo or wood],
three years to make one leaf—
then few are the things with leaves,
how can they speak of Dao/Way’s transformation?

**Chapter 65: Ancient Masters of the Dao**
The ancient masters who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people—
they sought only to bewilder them.

*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:
*"The people can be led by the Way,
but cannot be made to know it—
the ancient masters of the Dao
led them by the Way alone.
To reverse their natural state,
the Way can be carried and followed together—
no need for clever schemes,
thus it is called *bewilderment* [愚, *yu*].

Since the Three Dynasties [Xia, Shang, Zhou],
those who expound *wuwei* [non-action] and *tianran* [natural ease]
do not know how to handle *wuwei*’s affairs,
those who delight in *hentian* [artificial harmony]
do not know how to practice *unspoken teaching* [不言之教],
yet they claim to enlighten the people,
calling it *governance* [治],
but which chaos is greater than this?"*

*The Commentary* says:
*"The Sage’s Way is present in the world,
its benevolence is evident in its adaptability and completion—
thus the people can be led by it.
Its skill and depth are hidden in its application—
thus it cannot be made known.
The *Yijing* [Book of Changes] says:
*‘The common folk say “it works,” yet do not know why.’*
Mencius says:
*‘Many follow it all their lives,
yet do not know its Way.’*

The ancient masters of the Dao
each attained this principle,
yet they said:
*‘I bewilder the people’s hearts—
simple and pure,
the vulgar are clear and bright,
I alone seem muddled.’*
Pushing this to transform the people,
none would fail to follow it.

Obtained through observation and feeling,
reversing their natural state,
and restoring the heart’s original nature—
this is how they bewildered them.

Bewilderment leads to the Way,
the Way can be carried and followed together—
thus there is no need for clever schemes.

For the world has its natural course,
crooked and straight need no plumb line,
round and square need no compass—
adhesion does not require glue,
binding does not require ropes—
forgetting the Way’s artifice,
discarding the heart of cleverness,
this is how one does not lose its natural state.

Unless one is truly skilled in the Dao,
how can one reach this?

Since the Three Dynasties,
those who expound *wuwei* and *tianran*
do not know how to handle *wuwei*’s affairs,
those who delight in *hentian*
do not know how to practice *unspoken teaching*—
yet they claim to enlighten the people,
calling it *governance*,
but which chaos is greater than this?"*

Bending and curving the rites and music,
to rectify the world’s form yet harm it—
this is to await the plumb line and compass before achieving rectitude.

Ah, extolling benevolence and righteousness,
to soothe the world’s heart yet err in pedantry—
this is to rely on cords and glue before achieving firmness.

If such is the case, then the natural course is lost.
To claim enlightenment of the people,
calling it governance—
what greater chaos is there than this?

Zhuangzi said:
*"I have heard of nurturing the world,
but never of governing it."*

For to enlighten and govern the people
is not the way to govern the world.
Only by nurturing them does one see
the people daily incline toward the realm of peace and ease,
living in settled stillness—
why then speak of governing the world?
With such a heart of nurturing,
how could one say there is governance of the world?

The difficulty in governing lies in their excess of cleverness.
Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"When the world is often in great disorder,
the fault lies in their love of knowledge."*

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"If one’s knowledge of bows, crossbows, and arrows is excessive,
then winged and soaring creatures cannot ascend high.
If one’s knowledge of nets and traps is excessive,
then scaled and swimming creatures cannot dive deep.
If one’s knowledge of axes, saws, and tools is excessive,
then those who walk with calloused feet cannot tread in the abyss.
If this is true of things, how much more so for people?
Thus, the more one knows of deceitful schemes,
the more the common folk are bewildered by them."*

Zhuang Zhou, by examining the principles of things to verify human affairs, understands that all things arise from the **Dao/Way**, yet cannot be disturbed by cleverness. Thus, he says that when the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lies in their love of knowledge.

The **sage’s governance** always keeps the people without knowledge or desire, allowing the **Dao/Way’s** empty tranquility to emerge as the natural response for all under heaven—what need is there for cleverness to suffice?

Therefore, those who speak well of governance say:
In discussing the foundation of **Great Peace (太平)**, they declare that **schemes and stratagems are not employed (智谋不用)**.
In speaking of the marvelous transformation of the **Dao/Way (道化)**, they say that it does not rely on **cleverness and skill (不恃智巧)**.
Is this not to say that the essentials of governance lie in **knowing the Dao/Way (知道)** rather than in loving cleverness?

Hence, **governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.
Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"When laws are promulgated, deceit flourishes; when decrees are issued, fraud arises."*

The **Cushui commentary** explains:
Zhuangzi says: **"The wise are instruments of contention (争之器)."**
If cleverness arises from contention, then the people will pursue profit and become **artful in schemes (机巧)**.
What is meant by **"laws are promulgated"** is that without laws, there is nothing adequate to bind them.
If severe prohibitions are established by law, yet there are still those who **defy and transgress (抵冒)**, then the hearts of deceit and malice cannot be unified.
What is meant by **"decrees are issued"** is that without decrees, there is nothing adequate to command them.
When decrees are issued, only obedience follows—yet if there are still those who **pretend compliance (面革)**, then the emotions of deceit and falsehood cannot be stopped.
The **Classics** say: *"The more laws and decrees are multiplied, the more thieves and robbers will appear."*
Thus, deceit and fraud are evident—**governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.
**Not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.
Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"Burn the symbols and shatter the seals, and the people will be simple and unsophisticated.
Abandon the measures and break the balances, and the people will not contend."*

The **Cushui commentary** explains:
Zhuangzi says: **"The Dao/Way is the public standard (为之公)."**
If the **Dao/Way** is made the public standard, then the people will naturally **trust without constraint (不约而自孚)**.
What is meant by **"burn the symbols and shatter the seals"** is not that they are literally burned and broken—rather, by **establishing trust (信信)**, the people become simple and unsophisticated, and symbols and seals are no longer relied upon.
What is meant by **"abandon the measures and break the balances"** is not that they are literally discarded and snapped—rather, by **acting with fairness (平平)**, the people do not contend, and measures and balances are of no use.
The **Classics** say: *"If I love tranquility, the people will naturally be upright.
If I have no desires, the people will naturally be content."*
When the people are upright and content, their simplicity and lack of contention are clear—**not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.
Understanding these two principles is the **model (楷式)**.

Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"Understanding these two principles means knowing how to govern the state.
Knowing how to govern the state, the people will follow and emulate them as the model."*

The **Cushui commentary** explains:
*"The form is correct, then its reflection is correct;
The source is clear, then the stream is clear—
this is the natural correspondence (自然之符)."*
The **sage**, standing above the people and things of the world,
**upright in form and clear in source (端表澄源)**,
governs without action while the world transforms—
it is only a matter of **employing cleverness or not employing cleverness (用智与不用智)****.
Understanding these two principles means knowing that the responsibility of governance lies in **clarity and tranquility (清静)**, with no need for cleverness.

If one does not govern with cleverness,
then those who listen to the **sage’s voice (听唱)** and observe his **rites and conduct (视仪)**,
will derive their **model (效法)** from the **Dao/Way’s** manifestations and responses—
who would not follow and emulate them as the model?

**Model (则)** is like the **standard for making a standard (作则之则)**—
because it has a standard, the people follow the standard.
**Emulation (象)** is like the **pendant for hanging a pendant (垂象之象)**—
because it has an emulation, the people emulate it.
Only because there is a model and emulation,
the people follow and emulate them as the model.

If, for instance, Master Guanzhi posed the question:
*"Why does water round the basin, yet the basin itself is round?
Why does water square the vessel, yet the vessel itself is square?"*
His intent aligns with this.

**Constantly knowing the model (常智楷式)** is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**.
**Mysterious Virtue** is profound, vast, and contrary to things.
Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"Mysterious (玄) is the color of Heaven.
If one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,
then one unites with Heaven’s virtue—
profound beyond measure,
vast beyond limit,
standing alone above all things,
with nothing to pair with."*
Thus, it is said: **"contrary to things (与物反)."**

The **Cushui commentary** explains:
*"The subtle and minute is called Mysterious (玄).
Mysterious is the color of Heaven.
If one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,
then one takes **Embracing Unity (抱一)** as the model for all under Heaven.
If so, then abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,
following Heaven’s principles,
one should naturally unite with Heaven’s virtue—
silent and odorless,
profound beyond measure,
boundless and undivided,
vast beyond limit,
standing alone above all things,
with nothing to pair with—
this is what Master Liezi called **the Doubtful One (疑独)**,
hence it is said: **‘contrary to things.’**
Unless one **enters the Dao/Way (入)** and **discerns things (辨物)**,
who can unite with Heaven’s virtue?
Then one reaches **Great Harmony (大顺)."**

Emperor Xuanzong annotated:
*"Harmony (顺) is Heaven’s principle.
To reach **Great Harmony** means
abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,
following Heaven’s principle alone."*
Zhuangzi says:
*"To unite with Heaven and Earth,
its union is **profound and vast (缗缗)**,
as if **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**—
this is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**,
in accord with **Great Harmony (大顺)."**
Only by being **as if stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**,
can one abandon cleverness.

The **Cushui commentary** explains:
In the *Yijing*’s **"Yù (豫)"** it says:
*"Heaven and Earth move with Harmony (顺动),
so the sun and moon do not pass their bounds,
and the four seasons do not err."*
This is **Harmony as Heaven’s principle**—
from its **nature (体)**, **Qián (乾)** is the most robust,
yet from its **principle (理)**, **Qián (乾)** is easily known—
hence it is said: *"The simple principles of all under Heaven are easily attained (易简天下之理得),"
and this is why **Harmony** is Heaven’s principle.*

To reach **Great Harmony** means
abandoning the cleverness that makes one **artificial (使然)**,
and aligning with the **natural principles (自然之至理)**—
by **not knowing and not recognizing (不识不知)**,
following the **sage’s model (帝之则)** alone.
This is what is meant by:
*"Abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,
following Heaven’s principle."*

Zhuang Zhou wrote in the *"Heaven and Earth (天地)"* chapter,
discussing **nature (性)**, **cultivation (修)**, and **inverted virtue (反德)**—
when **virtue (德)** reaches its peak,
it is in accord with the **initial state (初有)**:
*"To unite with Heaven and Earth,
its union is **profound and vast (缗缗)**,
as if **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**—
this is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**,
in accord with **Great Harmony (大顺)."**
Between Heaven and Earth,
**there is emptiness yet no bending (虚而不屈)**,
**movement yet only expansion (动而愈出)**—
when united, it **communicates with Heaven and Earth (通於天地)**,
and when in accord, it is **only emptiness (同乃虚)****.

**Profound and vast (缗缗)** unite naturally—
not like firewood stacked and burning,
nor from any **known perception or discernment (所知见)**.
This is their union.

「When **stupid and befuddled (若愚)**, the mind becomes **profoundly silent (冥心)** and without knowledge,
when **befuddled (若昏)**, the eyes are **stuck and unmoving (胶目)** and without sight—
without knowledge and without sight,
this is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**.

When **virtue (德)** reaches **Mysterious Virtue (玄)**,
then **nature (性)** and Heaven accord naturally—
without striving or meeting others,
and thus in accord with **Great Harmony (大顺)**.

Only because they are **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**,
can they **abandon discernment (去智)**;
Only because they **abandon discernment (去智)**,
can they **return to virtue (原於德)** and **fulfill the Heavenly (成於天)**.

Zhuangzi, in the opening of the *"Heaven and Earth (天地)"* chapter,
speaks only of **Heavenly Virtue (天德)**,
and its meaning aligns with this.

**Chapter 66: "The King of All Valleys (江海为百谷王)"**
The reason **Jiānghǎi (江海)** can be the **King of All Valleys (百谷王)** is that it **excels in descending (善下)**,
thus able to be the **King of All Valleys (百谷王)**.

The **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:
*"When one undertakes deeds and establishes achievements,
and compares them to the highest (一上比者),
that is the **King (王)**."*

The **King (王)** carries the meaning of **returning and drawing (归往)**—
if a ruler **descends to those below (下下)**,
then the people **return to him (归之)**,
as water flows downward.

The **Cushioned Explanation (疏义)** states:
*"The Sage speaks of **virtue (德)**,
the **King (王)** speaks of **achievements (业)**—
these are the deeds and achievements
that make one a **King (王)**.
The **King (王)** is the **Lord (公)**,
and the **Lord (公)** is Heaven—
this is the comparison to the highest (一上比),
so one becomes a **King (王)**.
The **King (王)** carries the meaning of **returning and drawing (归往)**—
this is the **King of the people (下民之王)**.
The reason the people **turn toward and attach themselves (向往而亲附)** is that he **receives them humbly (容而下之)**,
possessing the **Way of descending to those below (下下之道)**.
Thus, those nearby **sing and rejoice (讴歌而乐)**,
and those far away **exert themselves to approach (竭蹶而趋)**,
like water flowing downward,
abundantly and irresistibly (沛然莫之能御).
The **Scripture (经)** says:
*"The Dao in the world is like the rivers and valleys to Jianghai.
The people’s **returning and drawing (归往)**—
is it not similar?"*
Yet, the Sage’s sequence states *"the ruler descends to those below (君能下下)"*,
and the *"Book of Poetry (诗)"* says *"there is none who does not comply (无不尔哉)"*—
does this not follow the **Way of knowing how to descend (知善下之道)"**?

Thus, the **Sage (圣人)** desires to **elevate others (上人)**,
yet speaks of **descending (言下之)**;
desires to **go before others (先人)**,
yet **follows in body (以其身后之)**.
Thus, the **Sage (圣人)**,
though **in the highest position (处上)**,
does not make others **heavy (人不重)**,
though **in the forefront (处前)**,
does not make others **harmed (人不害)**—
thus the world **rejoices to push him forward (乐推)** and does not **weary (厌)**.

The **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:
*"The *Yijing (易)* in the *Tún (屯)* hexagram’s first line says:
*'With the noble descending to the base, great is the people’s compliance (以贵下贱，大得民也).'*
He who **gains the people (得其民者)**,
**gains their hearts (得其心也)**.
When **in the highest position (处上)** but others do not **heavy (不重)**,
then they **follow him lightly (从之也轻)**.
When **in the forefront (处前)** but others do not **harmed (不害)**,
then many **benefit from him (利之者众)**.
If such, there is no thought that does not **comply (不服)**,
so there is no **wearying (不厌)**.
The *Yijing (易)* says:
*'The people comply with his ability (百姓与能).'*

The **Cushioned Explanation (疏义)** states:
*"The noble **takes the base as its foundation (以贱为本)**,
so the *Yijing (易)* in the *Tún (屯)* hexagram says:
*'With the noble descending to the base, great is the people’s compliance (以贵下贱，大得民也).'*
**Cloud and thunder gather (云雷并作)**,
forming the *Tún (屯)* hexagram—
this is the time when Heaven **created the ten thousand things (天造)** in **primordial chaos (草昧)**.
The **first line (初九)** represents the **governing ruler (经纶之君)**,
who can **cultivate himself through humility (能以谦自牧)**,
forgetting his **nobility (忘其贵)** and descending to those below,
thus becoming what the people **seek (民之所求)**—
so he **greatly gains the people (能大得民)**.
He who **gains the people (得其民者)**,
**gains their hearts (得其心也)**.
He who **gains their hearts (得其心者)**,
is this not beyond what **teachings and exhortations (教诰)** can command?
Because he **speaks of descending (以其言下之)**,
when **in the highest position (处上)** others do not **heavy (不重)**—
they all have **a heart to revere and wear (愿戴之心)**,
and thus **follow him lightly (从之也轻)**,
as Mencius says: *'Those who follow him are like returning to the market (从之者如归市).'*
Because he **descends in body (以其身下之)**,
when **in the forefront (处前)** others do not **harmed (不害)**—
they all have **a sincere desire to attach themselves (乐附之诚)**,
and thus many **benefit from him (利之者众)**,
as Zhuangzi says: *'Many benefit from benevolence and righteousness (利仁义者众).'*
Thus, the people from all four directions
do not fail to **love him as their parents (亲之若父母)**,
**cherish him as orchids and lily (爱之若芝兰)**,
without a thought that does not **comply (无思不服)**,
gained through the heart,
and **rejoicing to push him forward without hesitation (悦乐推而不耿)**.
The *Yijing (易)* says:
*'The people comply with his ability (百姓与能).'*

Indeed, Heaven and Earth **establish their positions (设位)**,
and the **Sage fulfills their abilities (成能)**—
with the **Sage fulfilling their abilities (圣人之成能)**,
the people **comply with him (与之)**,
then **love and praise him (亲誉)** is most fitting,
and there is no time when they **do not grow weary (而斁)**.

Because he **does not contend (不争)**,
the world **cannot contend with him (莫能与之争)**.

The **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:
*"He **practices virtue (行贤)** yet **abandons his own virtuous conduct (去自贤之行)**—
how could one not **love him (不爱哉)**?"

The **Cushioned Explanation (疏义)** states:
*"If one **practices virtue toward others (以贤临人)**,
there has never been one who **gains others (得人者)**.
If one **practices virtue toward others from below (以贤下人)**,
there has never been one who **does not gain others (不得人者)**.
If **practicing virtue toward others from below (以贤下人)** can **gain others (得人)**,
how much more so if one **practices virtue (行贤)** yet **abandons his own virtuous conduct (无自贤之行)**?
It is naturally fitting for him to be **loved by others (为人之所爱)**,
and thus **Yangzi (阳子)** has these words.

Indeed, **practicing virtue yet abandoning his own virtuous conduct (行贤而无自贤之行)**,
then he can **dwell in the realm of non-contention (处乎不争之地)**.
**Going securely without being loved (安往而不爱)**,
then **things cannot contend with him (物不能与之争)**.

The world all says of **Chapter 67**:
*"The world all says my Dao is **great yet seems unorthodox (大似不肖)**—
only because it is **great (大)**,
does it seem **unorthodox (不肖)**.
If it were **orthodox (肖)** for long,
then it would be **petty (细)** indeed."*

The **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:
*"The **orthodox (肖)** clings to things—**small (小)**;
the **clung to by things (为物所肖)** is **great (大)**.
The Dao **envelops and nurtures all things (覆载万物)**—
how **vast (大)** it is!
Thus it seems **unorthodox (不肖)**.
If it were **orthodox (肖)**,
then the Dao would have things outside it—
how could it be **great (大)**?"*

The **Cushioned Explanation (疏义)** states:
*"The **orthodox (肖)** imitates others—**its form is small (其体小)**,
so the **imitator (肖物者)** is **small (小)**.
The **great (大)** is what others **follow (人之所因)**,
so the **followed by things (为物所肖者)** is **great (大)**.
Swiftly did the **seventy disciples (七十子)** imitate **Zhòngní (仲尼)**—
through the **seventy disciples (七十子)** observing **Zhòngní (仲尼)**,
then **small and great (小大)** can certainly be known.
Yet the **Sage’s ability to fulfill the great (圣人所以能成其大)** is because he **obtains the root of the Dao (得道之本宗)**.

The Dao **envelops and nurtures all things (覆载万物)**—
it **takes the Dao as the origin of all things (以道为万物祖)**,
so there are **ten thousand differences (万不同)**,
all arising from it.
Heaven and Earth, though **great (大)**,
and the **autumn hair (秋毫)**, though **small (小)**,
all do not **transcend the Dao’s enveloping and nurturing (不外於覆载之内)**.
*"How vast it is!" (洋洋乎大哉)*—
this speaks of its **all-encompassing embrace (无不该徧)**,
and **broad capacity (广乎能容)**.
Being **clung to by things yet not clinging to things (为物所肖而非肖物)**,
thus it seems **unorthodox (不肖)**.
If it were **orthodox (肖)**,
then the Dao would have things outside it—
how could it be called **great (大)**?
Outside the Dao,
what things are there?
Even if one **forcibly names it (强为之名)**,
it is still not **great (大)**.
If one **speaks of it as unbegun (未始有)** without **opposing terms (对言之)**,
then it is certainly **not to be debated (固不可以议)**.*

I hold three treasures, treasures to be cherished.
Huizong’s annotation: Different from the common world’s perception, yet guarded without loss, these are the treasures I hold.
Exegesis: The Sage differs from the virtuous; viewing the Sage through the eyes of the virtuous still reveals distinctions—how much more so with the vulgar’s perspective? Their divergence is profound indeed.
The so-called three treasures: In the vulgar world, they are obscured by private views, mistakenly deemed small. Yet when viewed through principle, they are what constitutes the great.
To differ from the vulgar’s perception and guard them without loss—then one embraces them well without abandoning them, never for a moment separated. This may truly be called cherishing and holding them.

The Confucian scholar does not treasure gold and jade but holds loyalty and trust as treasures, thus knowing that my three treasures lie within, not without, and must be held to their utmost.

Alas, the vulgar man treasures his treasures yet fails to treasure their essence, making them burdens upon himself. Hence, those who treasure pearls and jade invite calamity upon themselves.

**First: Benevolence.**
Huizong’s annotation: Benevolence loves all things; it is the substance of virtue.
Exegesis: Benevolence takes compassion for all as its heart; virtue takes love for humanity as its foundation. Thus, filial piety begins with a father’s benevolence, and feasting demonstrates benevolent kindness. Ultimately, all stem from love—how could benevolence not be the substance of virtue?
Laozi spoke of Dao and virtue, rejecting virtue yet treasuring this; he did not reject it but sought to clarify virtue’s essence.

**Second: Frugality.**
Huizong’s annotation: Frugality ensures sufficiency; it is the moderation of ritual.
Exegesis: Frugality is the common virtue; ritual values appropriate use. Thus, frugality without ritual leads to universal scarcity, while frugality with ritual is fitting. Ultimately, all honor sufficiency—how could frugality not be the moderation of ritual?
Confucius said, *"Rather be frugal than extravagant"*—he did not mean miserliness but sought to clarify ritual’s moderation.

**Third: Not daring to lead the world.**
Huizong’s annotation: To lead is to seek victory over others, to value strength over virtue.
Exegesis: There is a constant way of victory called softness, and a constant way of defeat called rigidity.
Softness does not seek victory over others; it manifests as yielding, weakness, and humility, yet none can contend with it.
Rigidity seeks victory over others; though it strives to excel, how can it always excel?
If one can be rigid yet not soft, leading to seek victory over others, then one values strength over virtue.
Strength is the beginning of contention; valuing strength means favoring bravery, and things will oppose it—like Zhuangzi’s *"using cleverness to contend with strength."*
Humility is the handle of virtue; valuing virtue means softness and compliance, and none can demean it—like the *Yijing*’s *"Heaven, Earth, humanity, and spirits all take from humility."*
Then, those who seek victory over others value strength over virtue—how can they compare to those who do not seek victory, valuing virtue over strength?
To not value strength is to know not to dare lead the world, to humble oneself and advance in virtue. Thus, restrained in bearing, it becomes the corner of virtue.

Benevolence, therefore, brings courage.
Huizong’s annotation: King Wen viewed the people as wounded; his anger settled the world’s people.
Exegesis: The virtuous must be courageous; thus, those who love others abhor harm to them.
The virtuous must have authority; thus, constant virtue suffices to establish martial affairs.
King Wen cherished the common people, benefiting widows and orphans. Mencius called his care for the people like tending to wounds—truly benevolent.
When his wrath flared, he disciplined his troops and achieved martial triumphs, conquering the exalted. His anger settled the world’s people—his courage was unmatched.
Thus, benevolence brings courage; this is evident.

Frugality, therefore, brings breadth.
Huizong’s annotation: Store in winter, and abundance will flourish in spring.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot always indulge in excess; how much more so for humanity?
Exegesis: The *Yijing* says: *"Kān is concealment and withdrawal."*
Kān corresponds to the north in direction and winter in season, where all things retreat—thus, concealment is spoken of in winter.
It also says: *"Zhèn is flourishing and abundance."*
Zhèn corresponds to the east in direction and spring in season, where all things emerge—thus, abundance is spoken of in spring.
Only by concealing in winter does abundance come in spring. The movement of qi and the principles of all things have their own times of waxing and waning, their own measures of fullness and contraction. Heaven and Earth provide for all without ever indulging, transform into all things without ever wasting—thus even they cannot always indulge in excess. It is because they do not indulge in excess that they achieve such breadth. Examined in human affairs, it is also that frugality brings breadth.

Not daring to lead the world, therefore, completes the vessel and makes it long-lasting.
Huizong’s annotation: The Dao does not contend yet triumphs—this is Heaven’s way. The Dao’s exaltation makes it the longest-lasting vessel.
Exegesis: Heaven is the parent of all things, transforming and nurturing, silently revolving in the boundless void. All things move and act through its mechanisms; those that emerge, it aids without hesitation; those that return to their roots, it guides without obstruction. It follows things’ natural course, aligning with their inherent principles.
Yet those confined by the numbers of birth and death all receive their mandates here, unable to escape its keys—thus, the Dao does not contend yet triumphs.
The Dao’s exaltation is first among all things, and none can demean it; hence, it is the longest-lasting vessel.

「Laozi states: *The sage employs the Way of the feminine*—when used, it becomes the foundation for leadership.
Huizong’s annotation: The sage comprehends the Dao’s boundless nature, dwelling in the world as though in a realm of non-contention, and none dare contend with him. The Great Dao already flows—how could it not be that which the world follows first, thus attaining the status of the longest-lasting vessel?

Now, abandoning the Way of the feminine yet clinging to the masculine, abandoning frugality yet seeking extravagance, abandoning humility yet aspiring to preeminence—this is the path of death.

Huizong’s annotation: The world’s people know that courage suffices to overcome others, yet do not know that compassion alone can foster true courage. They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, yet do not know that restraint alone can sustain true abundance. They know that leadership is esteemed, yet do not know that yielding precedence is the essential key. Thus, they are but the followers of brute strength, and their way is one of death.

Exegesis: The Three Treasures are the true essence of nature, not contrivances of human artifice. Only when one forgets both self and object can they truly treasure and uphold them. The world’s people, however, chase after superficial truths while abandoning the genuine, blinded to ultimate principles. They oppose objects with their own ego, clashing at every turn, knowing only that courage suffices to overcome others, boasting in strength, yet unaware that compassion alone can forge invincibility—*as the scriptures say: "The seven virtues make one unstoppable."* They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, indulging in ostentation, yet fail to grasp that restraint alone can ensure true abundance—*as the sages say: "Use it without exhausting it."* They know that leadership is esteemed, striving to excel in ability, yet do not understand that yielding precedence is the true path—*as the scriptures say: "He who yields precedence is first among men."* These are but the followers of rigidity and force; their way is one of death. Hence it is said: *The obstinate die the death of the strong.*

In ancient times, Zhuangzi spoke of the *Perfect Person* (博大真人) and said: *"He is always expansive toward things, never diminished by others—thus, compassion is known."* *"He moves with ease yet never wastes—taking moderation as his standard—thus, frugality is known."* *"While others take precedence, he alone takes last—thus, he does not dare to lead the world first."* If Laozi were such a man, he could truly be said to embody these teachings, not only manifesting them in words but also demonstrating them in deed. Yet the world’s people pick up these fragments and call them *rigidity and strength*, risking their own lives without reflection. Truly, they are the *blinded and deluded masses.*

Compassion, when wielded like a shield, becomes invincible. When held as a fortress, it becomes unshakable.

Huizong’s annotation: The virtuous man is unstoppable in the world—thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle. The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings—dying for him without hesitation. Thus, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.

Exegesis: Mencius said: *"When a ruler loves virtue, the world has no rival."* That is, the virtuous man is unstoppable in the world, for the people’s affection lies in virtue. The virtuous man, without rival, can thus awaken great benefit and align with the great harmony. The people’s return to virtue is like water flowing downward—inevitable. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, achieving total victory. The *Book of Documents* says: *"The people have no constant grievance, only grievance when virtue is absent."* Xunzi said: *"The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings."* Therefore, when the people’s loyalty is rooted in virtue, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.

In ancient times, King Tang of Shang conquered through kindness and virtue, and thus his courageous deeds were celebrated, none daring to refuse his offerings. This was the virtuous man’s unstoppable way in the world. King Tai of Zhou had boundless virtue, so the people of Qin followed him as though returning to their marketplace. This was the people’s love for their ruler. Those above, with virtue and benevolence, are unstoppable; those below, with sincere and willing hearts, love their ruler. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, unshakable in defense.

Compassion as a treasure—how could its value be slight? Heaven, when it would save and protect, does so with compassion.

Huizong’s annotation: Those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor. Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment. Thus, Heaven saves and protects through compassion alone—this is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures.

Exegesis: Those who exhaust their hearts know their nature. Those who know their nature know Heaven. Virtue is rooted in the inherent nature of all beings, a mandate from Heaven. Only by embodying virtue can one fulfill their nature; only by fulfilling their nature can one align with Heaven. Thus, those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor—*as the scriptures say: "Nurture the good, bless the benevolent, bestow a hundred blessings upon those who do good."* Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment—*as the scriptures say: "Overturn the wicked, punish the licentious, bring a hundred calamities upon those who do evil."* Therefore, those who follow the Dao are good, and those who lead with goodness are virtuous. Heaven’s Way is impartial, always rewarding the good. It saves them to make them secure, protects them to make them steadfast—all because of their goodness in compassion. This is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures, and also why virtue is the overarching name for all goodness, the consummation of humanity’s path. None can surpass the love of virtue.

*The Great Learning of the True Classic (道德真经疏义) concludes Volume XII, begins Volume XIII.*

The *Great Learning of the True Classic* (《道德真经疏义》), Volume XIII, Chapter LXVIII: **"The Virtuous Scholar Does Not Rely on Force"**

The virtuous scholar does not rely on force.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Force is the lower path; the scholar’s virtue lies in cultivating *ren* and *yi* alone.
Confucius said: *"I have not studied military affairs."*

*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The maneuvers of the three armies and five weapons are but the lesser applications of virtue. What is lesser was practiced by the ancients, yet not their priority—thus, force is the lower path. The scholar’s aspiration lies in the Dao, so cultivating noble intent is paramount.
*The Records* say: *"The scholar’s first concern is intent."*
Zhuangzi said: *"The worthy scholar values intent."*
All speak of the scholar’s purpose being to uphold lofty and enlightened intent, not to labor over the lesser applications of virtue. What intent should be cherished? Simply *ren* and *yi*.

To dwell in *ren* is to find a secure abode, fostering a heart that cannot bear to harm others. Thus, to kill the innocent is not *ren*.
To follow *yi*’s straight path means taking only what is just. Thus, to take what is not yours is not *yi*.
The virtuous scholar does not rely on force, nor does he delight in killing to harm *ren*, nor in taking to harm *yi*.
Confucius’ teachings also say: *"I have not studied military affairs."*

Thus, if the scholar’s intent is in the Dao, how can he neglect the root—*ren* and *yi*—and act otherwise? This is why Zhongyou could be brave yet cowardly, earning reproach at the Sage’s gate.

The skilled warrior does not rage.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* The highest strategy is to subdue through planning, yet rage truly overcomes deliberation.
*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The威 of virtue is perfected in tranquility and strength. The Sage’s martial prowess shines without haste, yet its effects arrive without movement; divine martial might does not kill, its influence is unfathomable yet profound. By calculating strategy, victory is secured at ten thousand *li*—even the wisest cannot devise such schemes. Though military doctrine values the highest strategy of subduing through planning, it achieves victory without battle. Why then resort to clashing arms and indulge in rage?

The Five Phases’ principle holds that wood overcomes earth, and among the Seven Emotions, rage overcomes thought. What is meant by *"rage truly overcomes thought"* is that it stems not from true virtue, but is driven by external influences. Yet the highest strategy of subduing through planning requires no rage at all.

King Wen’s display of righteous fury was but human rage in response to human rage. To match the people’s rage with rage is to share their breath, differing only in that it is not private fury. What is called *"emitting rage without raging"* is rage arising from non-rage. Only by understanding this can one speak of the skilled warrior not raging.

The one who best conquers enemies does not contend.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Contention is contrary to virtue. To fight for land fills the fields with the dead; to fight for cities fills the cities with the dead—victory and defeat remain undetermined.
*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Arms are laid down yet mobilized in due time. The virtuous one displays virtue, not force, aligning with the people’s hearts and following their desires—thus, contention is contrary to virtue. To contend is to crave battle and delight in slaughter: fighting for land fills the fields with the dead, yet external threats remain unchecked; fighting for cities fills the cities with the dead, yet internal strife persists. If so, cycles of expansion and contraction ensue, with victory and defeat still uncertain.

Only the virtuous scholar does not rely on force to perfect his martial virtue, thus embracing *ren* without fail and revering *yi* without hesitation—this is to campaign with *ren* and *yi*.
Only the skilled warrior does not rage to fulfill his rage, thus acting with purpose and achieving merit—this is to wield威 without raging.
Only the one who best conquers enemies does not contend to suppress contention, thus winning in battle and holding firm in defense—this is to conquer without contention.

By this, the realm is preserved, achievements secured, the people at ease, and the masses harmonized. The seven virtues of martial prowess lie here. These three principles all stem from virtue. Since they stem from virtue, their perfection is evident—thus, they are called *shàn* (virtuous).

This is the constant virtue underlying martial affairs—what makes *constant martial virtue* beautiful?

The skilled user of men is beneath them.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Though wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, the Sage does not deliberate alone—thus, the wise are employed for counsel. Though ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—thus, the capable are employed for service. Though eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—thus, the eloquent are employed as messengers.

*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Those who embody the Dao act without action yet are honored; those who handle affairs act with action yet are burdened. The Sage must act without action to govern the world—this is embodying the Dao. The subjects must act with action to serve the world—this is handling affairs. Only by embodying the Dao does one assign responsibility to those who handle affairs. Only by acting without action does one employ those who act with action.

Thus, the Sage’s wisdom, though vast as heaven and earth, does not deliberate alone—this is to say wisdom permeates the divine, yet he employs others’ wisdom, so the wise are his counselors, as the saying goes: *"The utmost wisdom does not plot."*
Though ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—this is to say he employs others’ abilities, so the capable serve as his agents, as the saying goes: *"Great skill appears as clumsiness."*
Though eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—this is to say he employs others’ eloquence, so the eloquent serve as his messengers, as the saying goes: *"Great eloquence does not speak."*

Thus, by not self-using, others willingly serve him. This is called the virtue of non-contention.
*Huizong’s Annotation:* Virtue transcends reputation; knowledge arises from contention. Those whose talents are whole yet whose virtue is unseen have never been heard to initiate—only to harmonize with others.

The *Shuyi* says:

When nurturing harmony, one preserves internally without dissipation—why seek reputation?
The wise cultivate tranquility, and harmony arises naturally from one’s nature—why engage in contention?
If virtue transcends reputation, others will also vie for it through reputation.
If wisdom arises from contention, others will also contend with me in wisdom.
Only those whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unseen—
who dwell in the harmony of virtue’s transformation of things,
seeing what is singular without perceiving what is lost—
then bear no burden of reputation or contention.

What is meant by *talents whole*?
Not disrupting harmony, yet bringing spring to all things.
What is meant by *virtue unseen*?
Not losing one’s nature, yet returning to the original virtue.

Standing alone in the realm of non-contention,
never leading but always following others,
as if riding the harmony of others without initiating—
this is surely one whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unseen.
Thus, the Master said: *"Never heard to initiate—only to harmonize with others."*
If not the virtue of non-contention, what else could this be?
This is called *employing others’ strength*.

「Huizong’s commentary states: The *clever* exhaust their sight and hearing, the *capable* exhaust their planning and abilities, yet those who hold positions know nothing.

The *Explanations of Meaning* say: Those entrusted with the tasks of ears and eyes must surely possess *cleverness* to exhaust their sight and hearing. For those who discern through vision, clarity comes first; those who perceive through hearing, *cleverness* is prized. Only by letting the near reveal their clarity and the distant reveal their *cleverness* can one fully grasp the myriad circumstances of all things.

Those entrusted with the tasks of the heart and strength must surely possess *capable* wisdom to exhaust their planning and abilities. For those skilled in planning, their wisdom is unobstructed; those skilled in strength, their vigor is unflagging. Only by internally wielding their wisdom and externally diligently applying their strength can one fully achieve the results of their undertakings.

The Sage surveys widely and listens inclusively, entrusts the *clever* and employs the *capable*—this is merely an excess of affairs. What enables them to utilize the world without self-assertion is their embodiment of the Dao’s *non-action* (wuwei). The *Classic* says:

*"Cleverness and wisdom, guard them with simplicity;
Bravery and strength to pacify the world, guard them with caution."*

What is meant by *"those who hold positions know nothing"*? Does it not declare this truth? This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ultimate of antiquity.

Huizong’s commentary states: *Non-action* (wuwei) for action is what is called *Heaven*. Without contention yet employing others, one can thus *harmonize with Heaven*. To *harmonize with Heaven* is to reach the utmost; nothing can be added beyond this, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*. *Ultimate* means *utmost*. The *house ridgepole* is the *utmost* of wood.

The *Explanations of Meaning* say: Heaven acts through *non-action* (wuwei) to maintain its clarity, and all things flourish, each following their natural growth from *non-action*. Thus, *non-action* for action is what is called *Heaven*.

The Sage engages in *non-action* (wuwei), thus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*. Without contention yet employing others, it is as though the boundless void nurtures life—creation and transformation occur subtly, and the Sage merely entrusts the Six Qi (六氣) to their own unfolding. Hence, one can *harmonize with Heaven*. Those who record rituals say:

*"High and bright, harmonizing with Heaven,
must be followed by *non-action* (wuwei) to complete,
thus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*."*

To align with Heaven’s *virtue/power* is to ascend with the Creator of all things and transcend all existence—this is called *harmonizing with Heaven*. If so, then one has reached the *utmost*, beyond which nothing can be added, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*. For *ultimate* speaks of the *utmost*—if like the *Great Ultimate* (太极), then its *utmost* is in *height*; if like the *Boundless Ultimate* (无极), then its *utmost* is in *distance*. The *house ridgepole* merely signifies the *utmost* of wood.

In the art of war, there is a saying: *"I dare not be the host but only the guest."*

「Thus, the *Huizong* commentary states: Those who *respond* are the *host* (主), those who *stimulate* are the *guest* (客). Only when pressed does one act, only when compelled does one rise—this is called *responsive warfare* (应兵). *Responsive warfare* is the *guest*’s way.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: The martial virtue of the sage does not rely on brute strength to turn the heavens and earth, yet the world cannot perceive its vigor; nor does it exhaust the wisdom of the gods, yet no one can fathom its depths. For those who command generals and lead armies like teachers, sharing the people’s sufferings—when *stimulated*, they *respond*, yet they dare not assert dominance. Only because they do not seek to overpower others, they are the *host* when *stimulated*, and the *guest* when *responding*. Pressed before they move, their actions are timely—this is the meaning of *"arms are laid aside but act when the moment comes."* Compelled before they rise, their rise is decisive yet unavoidable—this is the meaning of *"only when unavoidable do they act, and tranquility is the highest virtue."*

If so, then the first principle is to be *unconquerable*—waiting for the enemy’s conquerable moment to *respond* as *responsive warfare*, the *guest*’s way. As the *guest*, one displays the *prolonged weakness* (绵绵之弱), aligning with Sunzi’s saying: *"The skilled victor stands in unconquerable ground."* One does not dare advance an inch but retreats a foot.

The *Huizong* commentary states: Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: Facing arrows and spears, confronting blades and barbs—by means of arms, it is harsh; by nature, it is perilous. How could one willingly engage in such warfare? The general’s purpose is only to curb violence, lay down arms, pacify the people, and harmonize the multitudes. The essence of command lies in self-preservation in warfare, and in halting the blades in martial virtue. It is never the intent to revel in killing. Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy. Difficult to advance speaks to having something to defend—not cowardice in advancing, but knowing that defense alone ensures steadfastness. Easy to retreat speaks to having something to heed—not recklessness in retreating, but avoiding profit and courting danger. In the *Great Marshal’s* (《大司马》) teachings on battle formations, during hunting exercises, one is trained in sitting, rising, advancing, and retreating, with rhythms of swiftness, slowness, density, and sparseness. Sometimes, when the drum signals advance, one strikes the *bracelet* (镯) to regulate it; when the drum signals retreat, one sounds the *gong* (铙) to halt it. How much more so when facing the enemy—should one not carefully weigh the timing of advance and retreat?

The *Art of War* states: *"Unmoving as a mountain, taking its steadfastness and stillness."* It also says: *"Its swiftness like the wind, taking its speed and agility."* Only by understanding this can one grasp the profound meaning behind *"not daring to advance an inch but retreating a foot"*—this is the true essence.

This is called *"action without action"* (行无行).

The *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rely on martial force but acts without trace.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: Martial force is inferior to the *Dao/Way*; it is the lowest form of *virtue/power*. The warrior’s aspiration lies in the *Dao/Way* and is rooted in *virtue/power*, hence the skilled warrior does not rely on martial force. Moreover, even the grand armies of three divisions and five kinds of troops depend on the *spirit* and *movement* of the general’s will—so subtle as to be formless. How could martial force be visibly displayed? It is fitting that one acts without trace, that martial resolve lies in the will rather than in the deeds, and that its subtlety cannot be observed from the sidelines. There should be no need for the *phoenix* to parade in splendid towers or the *steed* to stand idle in the imperial stables, should there?

*"Defend without limbs"* (攘无臂).

The *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rage.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent must have courage, yet though they do not rage, their *威* (awe) remains. The *Odes* say: *"Like thunder, like fury."* Though described as fury, it arises from non-fury—this is the meaning of *"the skilled warrior does not rage."*

*"Unmatched without rival"* (仍无敌).

The *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled victor over enemies does not contend.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent have no rivals, yet though they do not contend, they prevail. The *Odes* say: *"None dare contend in their season."* Only because they do not contend, others cease their contention—this is the meaning of *"the skilled victor over enemies does not contend."*

*"Hold without arms"* (执无兵).

The *Huizong* commentary states: One relies on others’ strength, hence there is no need to wield arms.

The *Explanatory Notes* say: The priority of arms is to attach to the people; the *Dao/Way* of warfare is to harmonize with them. Thus, the skilled in attaching to the people are the skilled in warfare. Benevolent rulers above and below, a hundred generals with one heart, three armies united in strength—like children serving their parents and brothers, like limbs protecting the head. When prolonged, it is like the long blade of *Mo Ye* (莫耶), and those who grasp it are severed; when sharp, it is like the keen edge of *Mo Ye*, and those who face it are routed. All this depends on the strength of others—what need is there to wield arms?

Mencius said: *"One who commands awe over the world does not rely on the sharpness of arms, but gains the *Dao/Way* and receives much assistance."* The utmost of receiving assistance means the world submits to it; there are some conflicts one does not engage in, yet when one does, victory is certain—this is the meaning of *"relying on others’ strength."* To form the *arc* and *arrow* to command awe over the world is not to say one does not rely on the sharpness of arms. It is to say that *root* triumphs over *branch*—the emphasis lies in the strength of others, not in the sharpness of arms. This is the meaning of *"no need to wield arms."*」

Mencius said: *"He who does not delight in killing can unite the world. Then it is known that those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world—this aligns with the words of Laozi without prior agreement.*

Thus, when armies clash in confrontation, the compassionate will prevail. The *Huizong* commentary states: *"The Sage’s use of arms is to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked. Divine and martial, yet refraining from killing, the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel. Thus, *ren* (virtue/power of benevolence) permeates the world without fail, and *yi* (virtue/power of righteousness) commands reverence, making this the way of constant victory."*

The *Shuyi* (explanatory notes) say: *"The Sage rules the world, nurturing the people as a father. Heaven covers, Earth sustains, the seas embrace and spring nurtures—how could the Sage allow these people to perish in suffering without restraining their violence? Therefore, when forced to use arms to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked, the tyrant has no place to stand.*

Who but the wise and enlightened, divine and martial yet refraining from killing, could match this? Indeed, the divine and martial who refrain from killing do not subjugate all things through sheer force—this is how they win hearts and minds, drawing them with *virtue/power* and treasuring compassion as their jewel. Yet, what is this *virtue/power*? It is merely *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness).*

Thus, when *ren* (benevolence) permeates the world without fail, it is because the Sage abhors harming others—this is the meaning of *ren* (benevolence) embracing all. When *yi* (righteousness) commands reverence, it is because the Sage upholds order and abhors chaos—this is the meaning of *virtue/power* and awe inspiring fear. But if it is said that the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel and that *ren* (benevolence) embraces all, while *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, how is this possible?

It is because when *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) are practiced, both awe and love are achieved—compassion allows for courage. This aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *‘Naturally benevolent and compassionate, yet never forgetting to use benevolence as a gift and righteousness as principle.’* If *ren* (benevolence) embraces all and *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, then the people will willingly submit, their hearts content and their minds sincerely obedient. The next level of victory is truly insignificant—this is the way of constant victory, is it not?

In ancient times, King Tang of Shang ruled with *‘not competing, not contending’* to spread his governance, thus exhausting the work of *ren* (benevolence). He wielded *‘not startling, not moving’* to display his courage, thus exhausting the work of *yi* (righteousness). Both *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) fully realized, he could act without constraint and yet gather the fruits of victory—who would dare resist? Is this not the way of constant victory rooted in *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness)?

My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice."

The world cannot know it, cannot practice it.

Huizong’s annotation: The Dao shines brightly and is easy to see, hence when it is expressed in words, it is very easy to know; it is essential and easy to uphold, hence when it manifests in deeds, it is very easy to practice.

Mencius said: "The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?"

Thus, the Dao has no difficulty, and the world has no one who cannot grasp it. Yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they do not reflect and seek within themselves.

The *Cushui* commentary: The Dao is lofty and beautiful, shining brightly and easily seen, hence when expressed in words, it is as clear as the sun and stars, making it very easy to know. The Dao is unified and penetrates all things, essential and easy to uphold, hence when seen in deeds, it is precise as a level and plumb line, making it very easy to practice.

If we clarify this through the teachings of the Six Classics, the Dao becomes even more evident and easy to grasp. For instance:
- The *Book of Poetry* teaches *wēnróu dūnhòu* (gentle, kind, and thickly virtuous),
- The *Book of Documents* teaches *shūtōng zhīyuǎn* (open and far-reaching),
- And so on, extending to *guǎngbó yìliáng* (broad and easy to be good), *jiéjìng jīngwēi* (pure and refined), *gōngjiǎn zhuāngqīn* (reverent, frugal, and dignified), and the use of metaphor and analogy—all are manifestations of the Dao in words. By examining its expressions to seek its meaning, knowing it is not difficult.

The *Book of Poetry* guides the will,
The *Book of Documents* guides action,
And so on—guiding conduct, guiding harmony, guiding yin and yang, guiding names and distinctions—all are manifestations of the Dao in deeds. By examining its deeds to understand its principles, practicing it is not difficult.

Truly, Mencius’ words are profound: "The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?" The Dao is the path all people share, like a great road. Traveling in and out, coming and going, none can stray beyond it. The world has no one who cannot grasp it, yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they walk in darkness, or wander into narrow paths, or turn back at cliffs, or abandon the way halfway. All this stems from their lack of reflection. The reason they cannot grasp it is that they do not reflect and seek within themselves.

If they knew that everyone holds something precious within themselves, and could reflect and seek within, then the Dao would be near—there is no need to seek it far away, and the Dao would dwell within them.

Laozi’s teaching must say, *"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice."* Truly, he wished that all in the world and future generations would know to seek within themselves, to delve deeply into the Dao.

Words have their root, deeds have their master.

Huizong’s annotation: Words are boundless, yet principle is their foundation. Deeds are countless, yet the Dao is their sovereign.

The *Cushui* commentary: The expression of the heart’s voice arises spontaneously, without limit, and cannot be measured by clever calculations—this is why words are boundless. Yet they are expressed through metaphors and analogies, all of which are words, and though principle cannot be exhausted by these metaphors, it is never outside them. Thus, words have principle as their foundation.

The affairs of life are vast and endless, rushing by without measure—this is why deeds are boundless. Yet they are governed by standards and measures, all of which are deeds, and though the Dao cannot be sought in these standards, it is never separate from them. Thus, deeds have the Dao as their sovereign.

Zhuangzi said: *"When two households debate, which side’s argument is more biased in principle?"* If one’s words must return to ultimate principle, then it is clear that words have principle as their foundation. Yet principle is called the foundation because it aligns with the saying *"follow its root."*

Again, he said: *"To unite with the One is to complete all things."* If deeds encompass the Dao and advance to it, then it is clear that deeds have the Dao as their sovereign. Yet the Dao is also called the master because it aligns with the saying *"the key lies in the master."*

Principle can be followed but not defied—if one seeks it in accordance with principle, they will find it. When principle flows naturally, then words align with it, and though it can be followed, it cannot be lost. Only by following the Dao in action can one truly embody it, making the heart harmonize with the Dao. Then deeds align with the Dao, words align with principle, and deeds align with the Dao—holding this as verification and standard, there is no action that cannot succeed. The world has no difficulty.

To say it is easy to know and easy to practice—how could it not be true?

It is only the ignorant who do not know me.

Huizong’s annotation: The petty scholar’s knowledge does not transcend documents—though they claim knowledge, they truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?

The *Cushui* commentary: With a mind emptied and still, one can observe both near and far, delve into mysteries, uncover the hidden, and reach the profound—then wisdom is great indeed. The petty scholar’s wisdom is blinded by self-interest, and what they know does not extend beyond documents. Their spirit is wasted in shallow pursuits. Though they claim wisdom, it does not extend beyond the four seas—knowing the minutiae of hair and fur while ignorant of great peace, they claim knowledge yet truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?

Without the Dao, one cannot truly know—because their knowledge cannot reach it.

Zhuangzi said: *"To know the Dao is easy."* Only through profound insight and discernment, by treating ignorance as true knowledge, can one truly know. The petty and selfish in wisdom are not free from burdens, and to seek true knowledge is indeed arduous.

Few understand me, hence I am precious.

Huizong’s annotation: Those with lofty conduct in the world are condemned by the crowd, and those with unique wisdom are startled by the people. Thus, there are those who are noble precisely because they are few.

The *Cushui* commentary: To stand out and excel is lofty conduct in the world. Those with lofty conduct are rarely recognized by the common crowd, hence they are condemned by the masses, for the masses judge only by their own biased likes and dislikes. To preserve the spirit and seek the ultimate is wisdom beyond the petty—those with such wisdom are rarely understood by the narrow-minded, hence they are startled by the people, for the people are deeply mired in ignorance and delusion.

The censure of others arises from their difference, and the scorn of the people stems from their arrogance—like the cuckoo mocking the progress of the *Nanqi* stream, or the well-frog belittling the joys of the Eastern Sea. How often one sees their lack of measure!

To seek the reason for this, they are obscured by one-sided views, and their limited clarity is insufficient to attain true knowledge.

The *Transmission* says: There is nothing in the world more esteemed than the **Dao**. The **Dao** is esteemed above all because it cannot be known by knowing.

If shallow perception and meager understanding were sufficient to grasp the **Dao**, then what would make the **Dao** so precious?

Only because few understand me, am I precious.

The *Records* speak of those who are noble because they are few—truly, this lies in the fact that few understand me, hence I am esteemed by the world.

Thus, the Sage wears coarse robes while harboring precious jade.

**Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is hidden within Heaven, yet does not peddle himself in the marketplace.

**Cushui commentary:** The subtle essence of the **Dao** is never openly displayed, and the origin of things from the **Dao** is never known. The Sage is the ultimate of the **Dao**, merging with Heaven in emptiness—his concealment is profound.

From the perspective of his completeness within Heaven, he follows the natural order of Heaven, rests in its equilibrium, and moves without progress as Heaven’s play, acts without strife as Heaven’s mechanism. Observing Heaven without interference, rejoicing in Heaven without sorrow—these are all harmonizing with Heaven through Heaven, employing wondrous yet effortless use, surpassing mere goodness. To exert force and conceal it is to be hidden within Heaven.

Now, to hide a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may be called secure, yet there are times when it is lost. To hide gold in mountains or pearls in the depths may be called secret, yet there are times when it is lost. This is because what is hidden is in things, not in the **Dao**.

The Sage returns to the origin of nature, uniting with Heaven as one—how different this is! How could he take pleasure in worldly affairs, selling himself like a merchant?

The pretense of virtuous conduct is akin to selling jade as stone. The self-promotion of skill is like hawking techniques for gold. Not selling himself in the marketplace, the brightest virtue appears as humiliation, and great virtue seems as foolishness—this is to show that it has never emerged from his lineage.

To show that it has never emerged from his lineage, it is fitting that even the later generations cannot compare.

To know what is unknown is exalted.

**Huizong’s annotation:** The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent. Knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep. To say "I do not know" is true knowing—the ultimate of the **Dao**, hence it is exalted.

**Cushui commentary:** To emerge and interact with things is to reach no limit; to retreat and discern within is to reach a limit. The **Dao** attains its ultimate when it retreats to discern within things.

To retreat and discern within things is beyond what can be known by knowing—how much more so when it is dim and obscure, merging in the undifferentiated chaos, the spirit of spirits, yet able to refine itself? How much more so when it is hazy and silent, hidden beyond speech and intent, where things cannot be measured, yet all consider it the extreme?

Who would say that knowing can seek its ultimate?

Broadly, Guangchengzi said: "The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent"—this is because the **Dao** is not something that knowing can know.

When Taiqing asked about the boundless, he said, *"I do not know."* When asked about non-action, he said, *"I know."* The **Dao** uses these two statements—how does one determine which is correct and which is false?

This is because one has not yet understood that *not-knowing* is knowing, and knowing is *not-knowing*. This is why there are distinctions of depth and shallowness, interior and exterior. Thus, it is said: knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep.

Only knowing what is unknown is true knowing.

If so, then transcending form and emerging beyond the realm of being and non-being, standing aloof without associating with things—one can intuitively grasp it in silence.

What in the world is more exalted than this? Hence it is said: *To know what is unknown is exalted.*

To not know what is known is a sickness.

**Huizong’s annotation:** To not know the essence of the supreme **Dao** while knowing the coarse aspects of things, to not know the extreme of the **Dao** while knowing the trivial ends of things—already enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they say they tread the path of sorrow and calamity. Hence, it is a sickness.

**Cushui commentary:** Clarity arises from emptiness, awareness from stillness. The realm of Taiqing is initially free of any obstruction. Once false perceptions arise, the empty and still mind is suddenly immersed in things, and what is known is coarse while the supreme essence remains unknown, what is known is trivial while the supreme extreme remains unknown—these are all cases of those who do not know what is known.

Already enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they daily sink into the domain of sorrow and exhaustion. What sickness is greater? How could those who seek detachment prescribe remedies to rid them of the eight flaws and four afflictions, so they may naturally attain the tranquil realm of Taiqing?

Only by recognizing sickness as sickness can one truly be free from sickness.

**Huizong’s annotation:** To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness. To know one’s own confusion is not great confusion. Great confusion lasts a lifetime without resolution, and great foolishness lasts a lifetime without enlightenment.

**Cushui commentary:** Foolishness is ignorance without wisdom; confusion is doubt without clarity—both are ailments of nature. These ailments align with Confucius’ statement that the people have three afflictions.

Only by knowing this and discerning it can one resolve the obscurations and dispel the confusions. Zhuangzi said: *To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness; to know one’s own confusion is not great confusion*—this is why.

Indeed, to know one’s foolishness, to know one’s confusion—this is the sick speaking of their sickness. Not great foolishness, not great confusion—this is the sick recognizing their sickness, yet still not sick.

「If one fails to recognize their own foolishness yet still insists on applying it, or if they harbor two doubts and thus fall into confusion, then they shall remain a lifetime without enlightenment or resolution.

This is like the man from Nanrong and Yue, who knew their ailments yet could not endure the potent medicine of the Dao/Way—thus they wished only to hear the *Sutras of Longevity* (衛生之經).

Yet if one treats the disease that afflicts them, then they shall not be afflicted by it themselves. The Sage’s freedom from disease lies in their treating the disease—hence, they are not afflicted.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is naturally pure (素逝) and shuns worldly involvement (耻通於事), yet they establish the fundamental principles (立本) and comprehend divine unity (通於神)—this is true knowledge. Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so they are not afflicted.

**Cushui commentary:** *Naturally pure* (素) means untainted by the mundane; *pure and unconstrained* (逝) means they do not fail to traverse all things. Only by being naturally pure and unconstrained can one shun worldly involvement (不蕲通於事), yet all worldly matters become transparent to them (事無不通). This is because they have established the fundamental principles of the Dao/Way (立之本原), and so their wisdom unites with the divine (知通於神).

For the fundamental principles (本原) are the essence of the Dao/Way. Only by first establishing the great Dao/Way can one merge with the divine—then, with broad vision and seated contemplation, they perceive all things without obstruction, possessing true knowledge. Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so who could possibly weary their hearts?

Zhuangzi said that the man who is naturally pure and unconstrained, yet shuns worldly involvement, and who establishes the fundamental principles while comprehending divine unity, is a man of *Kingly Virtue/Power* (王德之人)—this is why.

**Chapter Seventy-Two of *The People Do Not Fear the Great Menace* (民不畏威):**
When the people do not fear the great menace, then the great menace has indeed arrived.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The petty man regards minor vices as harmless and does not abandon them; thus, the vices accumulate and cannot be concealed. The *Yijing* (《易》) states: *Bearing a burden and losing one’s ears—disaster.* (荷校灭耳，凶)

**Cushui commentary:** Good deeds that do not accumulate are insufficient to establish one’s reputation; evil deeds that do not accumulate are insufficient to destroy one’s life. Yet the people are born with thick ignorance (民生厚), and their inclinations shift with external influences (因物有迁). They abandon truth for illusion (舍真逐妄), delight in superficial ornamentation (外悦纷华), and engage in conflict over paths of gain and loss (交战於利害之涂) while remaining oblivious to fear. They regard minor good deeds as useless and do not perform them, and minor vices as harmless and do not abandon them. Thus, their evils accumulate beyond concealment (恶积而不可揜), and their crimes grow vast beyond absolution (罪大而不可解).

This is what Zhuangzi meant by *those who suffer external punishments at night* (宵人之罹外刑), and what the *Yijing* meant by *bearing a burden and losing one’s ears—disaster.* (荷校灭耳，凶)

Does not their pursuit of gain and avoidance of loss reveal that they do not fear the great menace? (迹其所为得，非不畏其威致然耶？)

Do not narrow their dwellings,」

「Do not narrow their dwelling,」
---

**Huizong’s annotation:** Dwelling is the abode of one’s nature; human nature is boundless and cannot be confined, yet those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way because they restrict their dwelling.

If expanded and filled, it will overflow to fill Heaven and Earth, embrace the six extremes, and nothing will be able to contain it. Mencius said: *Dwell in the broadest dwelling of the world.* The *cushui* commentary states: In the boundless expanse of the Great Peace, it fills Heaven and Earth without limit to its boundaries, circulates through the six voids without end to its traces, so that the abode of one’s nature is vast and cannot be confined—its grandeur is boundless.

Those in the world who are ignorant, confined by their own narrowness, see only things and not the Dao/Way. They dig through walls and plant weeds, and their dwelling begins to narrow—because those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way.

If one seeks its vastness and fluidity to restore the nature’s original state, there must be those who act with resolve to open the way. Then obstacles will be overcome, blockages will be cleared, and if expanded and filled, it will rise to the heights and spread to the depths, covering all beneath Heaven and embracing the six extremes. Its dwelling will be the broadest, yet never will it be confined or petty.

This is what Mencius meant by *dwelling in the broadest dwelling of the world*—it is also because they do not narrow their dwelling.

Zhuangzi said: *The fenced enclosures of the Bowei, the orchards of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of the Yu, and the halls of Tang and Wu.* Truly, the Dao/Way descends ever lower, and thus their dwelling becomes ever narrower.

**Do not weary of what they produce.**
Huizong’s annotation: Production is the gathering of *qi*; human life aligns with the transformations of all things, yet those who weary of their production say: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.* The reversals of this fate mean that the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them. Those who preserve the Great Harmony and avoid untimely death do so because they do not weary of what they produce.

The *cushui* commentary states: Human life is a mingling of coarse and refined, changing to form *qi*, *qi* changing to form shape, shape changing to form life—so life is but a fleeting gathering of *qi*. All who receive the *qi* of yin and yang to form their shape: at night, they rest with yin; within, they interweave with things. By day, they move with yang; without, they engage with things. Human life is inherently aligned with the Dao/Way of day and night and the transformations of all things.

Thus, when interweaving with things, all thoughts cease and turn inward; when engaging with things, all threads arise and respond fluidly. If one does not know how to preserve life to defend oneself, but instead exhausts oneself in myriad ways, it is as Mencius said: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.*

The reversals of fate are not uniform; even if the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them, their failure to preserve a good heart is rare indeed. Only those who guard pure *qi*, nourishing it with uprightness and without harm, will find that the Great Harmony of Heaven and Earth is enough to preserve them—keeping them from scattering, keeping them from departing.

Thus can they preserve life and fulfill their years, never meeting untimely death. Is it not because they do not weary of what they produce that this is achieved?

It is only because they do not weary that they do not weary. Huizong’s annotation: Misfortune and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions.

The *cushui* commentary states: Honor and disgrace arrive as reflections of one’s *virtue/power*. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—only human actions summon them. Thus, the rewards for good and evil, calamity and blessing, follow their kind. There is none who does not reap what they themselves have sown.

Then, if the refined *qi* of the Five Phases is attuned, and the spirit is prepared to receive all things, those endowed with nature’s original *virtue/power* who seek to avoid wearied production must truly not weary of their own life.

In ancient times, a farmer who tended crops recklessly plowed too deeply and hoed too harshly, and thus his crops suffered accordingly. But when he plowed deeply and harrowed carefully, his crops flourished and grew. Who would say that cultivating the body and refining the heart is not like the farmer’s lesson?

Those who cultivate life well should understand this. Hence, the Sage knows themselves but does not display themselves, cherishes themselves but does not exalt themselves—so they abandon that and take this.

Huizong’s annotation: The Sage has clarity in self-knowledge, yet does not parade their abilities; they have benevolence in self-cherishing, yet do not lord over others. Such beings act in the world without harming it, and the world cannot harm them.

They delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven and have no sorrow—what is there to fear in the threats of anger?

The Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking are now clear.

The *cushui* commentary states: Self-knowledge is clarity; the Sage has clarity in self-knowledge. Though their insight extends without limit, how could they parade themselves to boast of their abilities? Only by not parading themselves to boast of their abilities does one attain the height of wisdom. Those who parade themselves do not understand.

Self-cherishing is the utmost of benevolence; the Sage cherishes themselves with benevolence. Though they widely bestow and aid all, how could they exalt themselves to belittle others? Only by not exalting themselves over others does one attain the height of love. Those who exalt themselves are, in truth, belittled by others.

With this, they govern the multitude and thus can settle the world in peace, stability, and great harmony. Acting in the world without harming it, the world cannot harm them.

It is fitting that they delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven to preserve the world, yet fear no threats of anger.

The Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking—how could they be outside of self-knowledge without display and self-cherishing without exaltation?

---
**Boldly daring but not daring is death; boldly daring but not daring is life.**
Huizong’s annotation: The rigid and strong are doomed to destruction. The yielding and weak are preserved in life. Those who boldly dare are capable only of daring. Capable of daring yet unable to retreat is not true virtue—it is merely enough to destroy their body. Hence, Zilu loved daring, and Confucius said he was unfit for any purpose.

Those who boldly dare yet do not dare know how to hold back. To hold back is the Dao/Way of acting first.

Liezi said: *"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness."*

**Exegesis:** The rigid perishes; the sharp is blunted. The strong and unyielding are doomed to destruction. Softness overcomes hardness; weakness overcomes strength. Thus, the soft and weak are preserved in life.

Yet the world’s people know only to dare boldly, advancing resolutely without regard—never realizing that supreme softness can traverse the world’s greatest hardness. This is the Dao/Way’s true function: enduring and ever-present.

Zilu, though he wandered at the Sage’s gate, did not grasp the Dao/Way’s use. He could not restrain his reckless strength—daring yet unable to retreat—so where could he find true worth? It was enough only to destroy his body.

But those who know to embrace the雄 (heroic) while guarding the雌 (receptive) are not incapable of daring. Rather, they dwell in softness and stillness, yielding with things like a serpent’s coils, returning to the innocence of an infant. This is the daring of *not daring*—and thus, life.

Thus did Guangchengzi abide in harmony, refining his body for a thousand two hundred years without decay—precisely because he dared not dare.

The *Transmission* says: *"To act last is to act first."* To dare not dare is to know the Dao/Way of holding back. To hold back is to act first.

Only those who know the eternal Dao/Way of victory in softness can be spoken to thus. Hence, Liezi said: *"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness."*

These two paths—daring and not daring—bring either benefit or harm.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Where there is rectitude, there is deviation. Where there is obstruction, there is suitability.

**Exegesis:** What humans call "arriving at the Dao" is inversion; what the Dao calls "arriving at humans" is inversion. Those who dare boldly may seem to gain, but Heaven truly harms them. Those who dare not dare may seem to suffer, but Heaven truly benefits them.

For the principles of the world, where there is rectitude, there is deviation; where there is obstruction, there is suitability. They alternate and transform, waxing and waning naturally. Knowing these two paths makes the logic of benefit and harm clearly manifest.

What does Heaven abhor? Who knows its reason?

**Huizong’s Annotation:** The strange in humans aligns with the companion in Heaven. What benefits humans, Heaven abhors—who can know this?

**Exegesis:** Humans have long been overcome by Heaven. Those blinded by human ways, thinking to conquer Heaven, act recklessly in ignorance. How could birds, strange to humans, align with Heaven?

Thus, Heaven’s petty ones are humanity’s virtuous; Heaven’s virtuous are humanity’s petty—this is the natural order. Hence, even the Sage finds it difficult.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.

**Exegesis:** To follow is auspicious; to defy is ominous. Thus, those who follow endure; those who defy perish. To know human actions, one must know Heaven’s actions.

Zhuangzi said: *"To act in accordance with it—is that difficult? Those who find it easy, Heaven does not favor."*

The Sage aligns with Heaven, harmonizing with the divine to assist in transformation and nurturing. Though seemingly without difficulty, even the Sage does not dare to alter much—what of those beneath?

The Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend yet achieves victory.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** When things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. When things return, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction—this is called *not contending*.

To fill and empty, to wax and wane—Heaven participates with all things, yet all things receive their mandate from it. This is called *not contending yet achieving victory*.

**Exegesis:** Heaven’s movement knows no accumulation, and thus all things are completed. Only through movement without accumulation can it govern all things, transforming from non-being to being. The sun warms and nourishes all, so when things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. The yin consolidates, and all things are perfected, so when things return to their roots, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction.

As sovereign and regulator, it oversees myriad transformations, standing independently in the realm of non-contention. It sees the ebb and flow—one full, one empty—simply following the natural course of *qi*.

Moreover, though myriad things exist, none escape its pivot. Thus, all receive their mandate here, and what surpasses this as the Dao/Way of victory?

It speaks not, yet responds perfectly.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** What does Heaven say? It changes with thunder and wind, demonstrating with calamity and blessing—no deviation, only resonant response.

**Exegesis:** The thunder and wind stir all things. Heaven’s blessings reward the virtuous; its punishments befall the licentious. Heaven’s vastness cannot be rushed—its transformations are subtle, operating silently in the boundless void, embodying supreme beauty without speech.

Its means of change: perhaps the thunder stirs, the wind disperses—always in accordance with the season. Its means of instruction: perhaps it blesses the virtuous, punishes the licentious—always in accordance with their kind.

Yet its responses are swift, with no deviation—like shadows following form, echoes following sound. It never favors its responses. What does Heaven say?

It does not summon, yet they come.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who receive their mandate can summon them. The chaos of myriad things is governed by Heaven’s decree—who can summon them? It simply follows the unceasing flow of *qi*.

**Exegesis:** The *Qian* (Creative) is sovereign, the first to emerge among all things; it is father, the origin of all. Ministers receive their mandate from the sovereign; children obey their father—thus, those who issue the mandate can summon them.

Only by issuing the mandate can one govern all things, commanding all movement.

「All living things, in their myriad confusion, exist within an incalculable expanse—none can be summoned by any means. Unable to summon, yet they come; unable to compel, yet they arrive. Endlessly circulating without pause, they move through the boundless void, their transformations subtle and imperceptible, their **Dao/Way** unceasing, as **qi** flows naturally of its own accord, knowing not whence it springs yet simply is. Tranquil yet shrewd in counsel.

**Huizong’s Annotation:** Virtue and power are always easy to discern, yet perilous to grasp. Tranquility is ease; shrewd counsel is knowing peril. The **Qian** (Creative) accumulates three **yang** to form its substance—this is called **ultimate health**. Though perilous, if virtue and power remain easy, even the **yin**’s dangers cannot ensnare them. Does the *I Ching* not speak in *The Upper Appendices* of **Qian** knowing through ease, and in the *Qian* hexagram’s ninth line, of discerning the emergence of a single **yin**—then using it to bring about auspiciousness? Is this not the meaning of tranquil yet shrewd in counsel?

The **Heavenly Net** is vast and sweeping, though its mesh is wide yet never misses. **Huizong’s Annotation:** Though dense, it has gaps—this is human action. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue brings blessings; accumulated vice brings calamities—each responds in kind, thus nothing is ever lost. Yet those who strive only to win, who speak only to be answered, are human. Heaven does not strive yet wins effortlessly, does not speak yet responds perfectly—when summoned, it comes. Only the foolish fail to grasp Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.

Heaven does not summon yet they come; tranquil yet shrewd in counsel—only the **sage** can embody this. Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm, aligning with Heaven’s **virtue/power** and differing from those who dare boldly. **Exegesis:** Heaven follows **principle** (*li*); humans follow **emotion** (*qing*). Following emotion means favoring personal views—though meticulous, they lack comprehensive insight, hence the gaps. Following principle means upholding universal harmony—though sparse, they cannot be evaded, hence no gaps. Thus, though dense with gaps, this is human action. Accumulated virtue must bring blessings; accumulated vice must bring calamities—each befalls its kind, never failing. Is the **Heavenly Net** then deliberate in this? Its judgments on misfortune and fortune arise from inherent causes, all self-inflicted.

The world’s people are blinded by partiality, ignorant of great **principle** (*li*), chasing trifles while forgetting the root—each path they tread brings new woes. Yet they fail to see that the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is clear and evident, always favoring the virtuous, while the wicked have no place to hide from its scrutiny. Moreover, to know Heaven’s actions and human actions is supreme. Striving only to win, speaking only to be answered, summoning only to bring about—these are all human. When humans cannot align with Heaven, they are but petty and self-serving. If you rid people of this petty wisdom, they will return to **principle**—how could Heaven’s **Dao/Way** be unaligned with humanity? How could humanity be unaligned with Heaven? Only the **sage** can embody this: turning countless petty defeats into grand victory, like Heaven’s effortless triumph; practicing the **Dao/Way** of silent teaching, like Heaven’s perfect response without words; acting in accordance with **principle** yet moving naturally, coming without being summoned, like Heaven’s spontaneous arrival; serene and unassuming, their spirit like divination—tranquil yet shrewd in counsel. If the **sage** does not act, misfortune and fortune do not arise—who then brings disaster? Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm. This passage begins with those who dare boldly—human—and ends with the **Heavenly Net**’s vast yet flawless judgment—divine. The **sage**’s alignment with Heaven’s **virtue/power** is fundamentally distinct from the bold daring of common folk. This is why the passage begins and ends as it does—to illuminate all under Heaven and for posterity. Scholars should ponder this deeply.

**The People’s Common Disregard for Death (Chapter 74)**
The people do not commonly fear the **sword and saw** (execution’s tools), nor death itself—how can you frighten them with death?

**Huizong’s Annotation:** The people have natural hearts, finding life joyous. If they lack this natural heart, why should they fear death? The **sword and saw** restrain them; the **measuring line and weights** (law’s strictures) kill them; the **mallet and chisel** (punitive tools) strike them—this is called frightening them with death. The people will only resist and never reform.

**Exegesis:** From birth, the people are not inherently distinct—**Heaven** bestows upon them a pure spirit, a simple nature. They are the most refined of all creatures, the noblest of Heaven and Earth. Who does not delight in life and abhor death? Water, unobstructed yet easily swayed by external things, lacks constancy of heart. If they lack this natural heart, they will flout laws and evade prohibitions, doing whatever they please—until they fall into crime, whereupon punishment follows. Thus, these are people who do not fear death yet are frightened by it.

Only when the **sage** cultivates the virtue of cherishing life deeply in the hearts of the people will they know to rejoice in their own lives, naturally moving toward goodness and away from crime—thus avoiding conflict with officials and rendering punishments obsolete. Yet there are those restrained by the **sword and saw**, killed by the **measuring line and weights**, struck by the **mallet and chisel**, who resist yet never reform—are these not the same? If you make the people constantly fear death, and those who act strangely, I shall seize and execute them—who would dare? **Huizong’s Annotation:** All under Heaven take joy in life yet weigh heavily the crime of breaking laws. Only then will strange words be punished, eccentric deeds prohibited—if your crimes against governance are indeed grave.

**Exegesis:** Once the people delight in life, nothing they desire is greater than life itself, nor do they abhor anything more than death—while breaking laws is the heaviest crime. Thus, the people each safeguard their natural inclinations toward life and death: words must have substance, so strange utterances cease, knowing they will be punished; actions must conform to **principle**, so eccentric deeds are rare, knowing they are forbidden. If you seize and execute them, the state will have enduring laws—seeking those who resist, I know none would dare. Indeed, if your crimes against governance are grave, this is precisely the intent.»

「If there is a fixed official to execute, let the fixed official execute. But if a substitute official executes, this is like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.

**Huizong’s annotation:** The ruler must act without personal interference while the people act in accordance with the ruler’s will—this is an unchanging **Dao/Way**. If a substitute official executes, or a substitute carpenter wields the axe, this means the ruler and the people share the same **virtue/power**, reversing the **Dao/Way** and speaking contrary to it. How could such a ruler govern others if he himself is governed? King Wen of Zhou did not meddle in the myriad words, myriad legal cases, or myriad precautions, but only sought the proper officials to shepherd the people—this is why he succeeded.

**Exegesis:** The ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the ministers handle affairs. Those who follow the **Dao/Way** act without interference and are honored, thus they serve the ruler’s will. Those who handle affairs act with purpose and bear burdens, thus they serve the **Dao/Way** for the people. The distinction between ruler and minister is an unchanging **Dao/Way**. Only when each has fixed responsibilities that cannot be altered does the legal official execute, the carpenter wield the axe, and the ruler merely maintain his own decorum and face south. Those who engage in affairs of governance never cross the boundary to inquire further—if the ministers act, the ruler must also act, then it is the substitute official executing, the substitute carpenter wielding the axe, and the ruler and ministers sharing the same **virtue/power**. How could such a ruler govern others? Thus, when speaking contrary to the **Dao/Way** and meeting it with falsehoods, he is one who others govern. The **sage’s** governance is without interference yet the world’s affairs are accomplished—this is the essential key to attaining governance. To know the **Dao/Way** is to act without interference, to have no affairs of one’s own, and yet the world serves its purpose.

Therefore, King Wen could settle the worthy and appoint them, ensuring they had no meddling in myriad words, myriad legal cases, or myriad precautions, but only in securing proper officials to shepherd the people did he see urgency—then it is clear that he had no substitutes to fear. Indeed, a substitute carpenter wielding the axe would rarely fail to harm his hands. **Huizong’s annotation:** If a substitute takes on new tasks without exemption from injury, how much more so when substituting for execution? This is why the ancients valued the **Dao/Way** of non-interference. Non-interference means the ministers bear full responsibility.

「The *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* states:

*"To grasp the great **symbol/principle** (大象, *dàxiàng*), the world follows; when it follows without harm, there is peace and ease. The **Dao/Way** of the Sage in governing the world lies in attending to affairs of **non-interference** (無為, *wúwéi*), and practicing instruction without words. Thus, the Sage could place the world in a state of peace and ease, and how could there be any harm from a substitute’s axe?

In *The Answer to the King* of *Zhuangzi*, it is said: *'The **Dao/Way** of non-interference means full responsibility for affairs.'* This is the **Dao/Way** of non-interference where those entrusted with duties bear full responsibility.

It is fitting that at the end of the chapter, it states: *'The **Perfect One’s** (至人, *zhìrén*) use of the heart is like a mirror—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without hoarding. Thus, the **Perfect One** can overcome things without harming oneself.'*

**Chapter 75 of the *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* (卷十三結):**
*"The people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes of their superiors—this is why they starve."*

**Huizong’s Annotation:** *"When taxes are heavy, fields and crops are prone to neglect, and the people lack sufficient food."*

The *Commentary* states:
*"Mencius said: 'Transform their fields, reduce their taxes, and the people can be made rich; feed them according to season, use them with propriety, and wealth will be inexhaustible.' The Sage’s governance of the world ensures that the people can hold food to their chins and play, drum their bellies and stroll, saying that they enjoy sustenance and that the people are well-fed throughout the year. This is not merely achieved by lightening the taxes to nourish the people, but also by guiding them to abandon trivial pursuits and return to the fundamental **Dao/Way** (本, *běn*).

Indeed, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in benevolent governance, and governance exists to enrich the people. In ancient times, those who understood this would survey the twelve regions of soil to discern their suitability, then teach the people the appropriate cultivation methods for each. They would assign land responsibilities, establish tribute systems, and reward those who succeeded in their tasks with the honor of *鄙師* (lowly teacher), while punishing those who failed with the blame of *載師* (burdened teacher). Thus, the people would all exert themselves in their fields, take joy in their work, and strive for success—so the common folk would not suffer from hunger.

At that time, they relished their food, admired their attire, unaware of the **Imperial Dao/Way’s** (帝力, *dìlì*) influence upon them. How could there be any calamity of neglected fields and insufficient food?

The people are difficult to govern because their superiors meddle in affairs—this is why they are difficult to govern."*

**Huizong’s Annotation:** *"When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud proliferate, and the people lose their simplicity."*

The *Commentary* states:
*"The Sage relies on the **Dao/Way** in the world and governs through affairs. Though responding to the myriad things, the Sage remains rooted in the **Dao/Way’s** essence of non-interference. Even in the application of rewards and punishments, the Sage does not depart from the fundamental principle of *渊虚* (profound emptiness, *yuānxū*). Loving tranquility, the people naturally align; without burdensome affairs, the people naturally thrive; without desires, the people naturally remain simple. This is so because the Sage depends on **Dao/Way** transformation rather than clever schemes. Relying on **Dao/Way** transformation means governance is not burdensome; not depending on clever schemes means deceit and fraud cease, and the people return to their simplicity.

The *Classic* says: *'When governance is obscure and gentle, its people are pure and honest; when governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'* When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud arise, and the people lose their simplicity—this is the meaning of *'governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'*

People’s disregard for death arises from the depth of their attachment to life—this is why they lightly view death."*

**Huizong’s Annotation:** *"When life is cherished too deeply, the pursuit of gain becomes fervent, leading to reckless and licentious behavior, with no bounds."*

The *Commentary* states:
*"Life is what I desire, but there are things I desire more than life—this is why I would not obtain it at any cost. Death is what I abhor, but there are things I abhor more than death—this is why some misfortunes I would not avoid.

The people of the world do not understand this: they cling to what is weighty and discard what is light, thus excessively valuing life while neglecting righteousness. Those who would gain any advantage at all cost do so without restraint.

Because of their deep attachment to life, the people’s pursuit of gain is relentless—contending for fish, they are willing to get wet; chasing beasts, they are willing to run. To the point of losing their natural balance, they indulge in reckless and licentious behavior, doing whatever they please. Even when facing perilous risks, they regard death lightly. Though life is cherished too deeply, this very attachment leads to its destruction.

Only those who do not make life their primary concern are wiser than those who overly value it."*

**Huizong’s Annotation:** *"Zhuangzi said: 'Those who comprehend the essence of life do not labor for what life cannot provide.'*
*Those who do not make life their primary concern do not labor for what life cannot provide*—this is abandoning affairs while relinquishing life.

Abandoning affairs means the body is not taxed; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted. When the body remains whole and the essence is restored, one aligns with the **Dao/Way** and becomes one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it.

Extending the principles that benefit my own life to the people, we see lightened taxes, simplified punishments, households with sufficient provisions, and people well-clothed. Yet the people do not transgress, and this is the ultimate achievement of the **Imperial Dao/Way** (帝王, *dìwáng*)."*

The *Commentary* states:
*"The **Dao/Way** is fundamentally empty of things; your body is also empty. Even in the matters that concern your very existence, nothing is more vital than life—yet life is not truly yours to possess, for it is the **Heavenly Harmony** (天地之委和, *tiāndì zhī wěihé*) entrusted to you. Only by not claiming life as your own can you preserve it entirely. Thus, those who comprehend the essence of life—how could they labor for what life cannot provide?

Alas, the people of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to sustain life, yet nourishing the body ultimately fails to preserve life. They do not realize that without burdens, one remains balanced and upright; when balanced and upright, corrupt **qi** cannot assail, and **Heavenly Harmony** will naturally arrive, blending with their own vitality. Thus, they attain a renewed life.

Without burdens, one does not make life their primary concern; not making life their primary concern means they do not labor for what life cannot provide. This allows one to abandon affairs while relinquishing life.

Abandoning affairs means the body is not taxed yet remains whole; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted yet restored. When the body is whole and the essence is restored, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) returns to its original state, and one aligns with the **Dao/Way**, becoming one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it."*

The **Sage** examines the means by which we nurture our life, and when applied to the people of the world, they bring about abundant governance and thriving populace. Light taxes and levies are seen, and clear laws bring the people into submission. Harsh punishments are avoided, yet families are well-provided and people are content—those above have what they need, those below have what they nurture—so the people naturally incline toward the realm of **virtue/power** (仁寿, *rénshòu*). Needles and saws are not employed, axes and chisels are not used, clothing and headgear are simply adorned, and garments are distinguished—yet the people do not transgress.

Thus, nobles and commoners fulfill their roles, and the **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) of the wise and the unworthy aligns with their nature. The Sage achieves the **Dao/Way** of great peace, and its brilliance matches the winds of the ancient times.

Examining its source, one understands the principle of **non-action** (无为, *wúwéi*). The means by which we nurture our life is merely to apply it to the people.

Thus, the people have enough food and do not starve, return to simplicity and are not difficult to govern, and value life without regarding death lightly—this is the ultimate achievement of the **Emperor-King** (帝王, *dìwáng*), is it not?

**Human life spans seventy-six years.**
Human beings are born soft and weak, yet in death they become hard and strong.
Grasses and trees are born soft and brittle, yet in death they become withered and decayed.

Thus, those who are hard and strong are the followers of death, while those who are soft and weak are the followers of life.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** All things bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony. The yang’s **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in its ability to generate life, while the yin’s function is to bring about austerity and destruction.

When the yin’s austerity prevails, the harmony of blending is lost.
Hence, it is said: the hard and strong are the followers of death, while the soft and weak are the followers of life.

**Explanatory notes:** *Lǐzǐ* states: The transformations of yin and yang are called life and death.

All things flourish within Heaven and Earth, adorned by the strange pairings of yin and yang, confined by motion and stillness. None fail to bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony.

Speaking of life and death, the yang **qi** is ever effusive, generating life as its **virtue/power** (德, *dé*), and all things thereby unfold and thrive—so the soft become hard, the weak become strong. The yin **qi** is ever congealed, bringing about austerity and destruction, and all things thereby wither and decay—so the hard are ruined, the sharp are blunted. As the **qi** subtly shifts, reaching the point of austerity and destruction, the harmony of blending is lost and returns to the utmost stillness.

Those who serve the yin and yang in the world know that life and death alternate, yet they do not grasp the constant **Dao/Way** of victory: softness (柔, *róu*), nor the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat: hardness (刚, *gāng*). Thus, they abandon the principle of life and move toward the realm of death.

For the **Dao/Way** is the interplay of one yin and one yang; all things follow it.

In terms of **affairs** (计事, *jìshì*), hardness and strength suffice to overcome softness and weakness. Yet in terms of the **Dao/Way**, softness and weakness suffice to overcome hardness and strength—this is why hardness and strength are the followers of death, while softness and weakness are the followers of life.

Hence, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When opposing armies clash, the pitiful will triumph.

**Explanatory notes:** The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is but the end of **virtue/power** (德, *dé*).

The **Sage** mobilizes **spirit-qi** (精神, *jīngshén*), moves the **heart-methods** (动心术, *dòngxīnshù*), and focuses on the **root** (本, *běn*), from which the **branches** (末, *mò*) follow. Thus, Heaven’s awe is manifest, and the **spirit-martial** (神武, *shénwǔ*) does not resort to killing. This is seen in the **Sage**’s benevolence extending across the world, and righteousness inspiring awe throughout the world. Such an approach is indeed sufficient to uphold the **root** (大定功, *dàdìnggōng*) of great peace, to settle the people and harmonize the multitude, and to attain the constant **Dao/Way** of victory. How could one ever prioritize the strength of armies?

Therefore, those who assist the **Sovereign** (人主, *rénzhǔ*) with the **Dao/Way** do not rely on making armies strong throughout the world.

Yet when opposing armies clash, the pitiful triumph—this is because they hold victory well.

When wood is strong, it is split.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The sturdy branches of *gōngbǎ* (拱把) mulberry and *zǐ* (梓) trees—people all know to cultivate them, yet when they become strong, they are cut down and split.

**Explanatory notes:** The *Shijing* says: *"The chairs are made of mulberry and zǐ wood."*

Indeed, mulberry and zǐ wood are gentle and refined materials, fit for ceremonial and musical use. When they first grow, they are but small branches, and people, if they wish to cultivate them, all know to nurture them because of their softness and weakness.

Yet when they rest day and night and are nourished by rain and dew, and can serve as the beams of halls or as tools and implements, then they are cut down and split—because of their hardness and strength.

Looking at plants, even they are felled first when strong, so how can one doubt that hardness and strength are the followers of death?

Thus, hardness and strength occupy the lower position, while softness and weakness occupy the higher.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The victory of softness over hardness, and of weakness over strength, is the **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of the **Master Lao**.

*Zhuāngzǐ* says: *"To display meekness and weakness, and to practice humility and submission."*

**Explanatory notes:** Softness is the **Dao/Way**’s hardness, so the constant **Dao/Way** of victory lies in softness. Weakness is the **Dao/Way**’s strength, so the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat lies in hardness.

For softness accumulates into hardness, and the accumulation occurs first.
Weakness accumulates into strength, and the formation occurs later.

The first is above, the latter is below. Hardness and strength are naturally above, while softness and weakness are naturally below.

Observing this in Heaven and Earth, Heaven accumulates **qi** (气, *qì*), fulfilling its role in generating life and occupying the upper position—its accumulation is not hardness and strength. Earth accumulates masses (块, *kuài*), fulfilling its role in bearing form and occupying the lower position—its accumulation is not softness and weakness.

Observing this in the principles of things, water’s nature is to follow: if directed east, it flows east; if directed west, it flows west. Yet in attacking hardness and strength, it cannot overcome them. Wind, when it points at me, overcomes me; when it blows against me, it also overcomes me. Yet it alone can break down great trees—this is because it accumulates the unyielding force of countless small victories into a great victory.

Thus, the victor is above, and the vanquished are below.

The **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of **Master Lao** are often found in this principle: hardness leads to ruin, sharpness leads to blunting. Hence, one knows to be male yet preserve the female, to be bright yet embrace the dark. While others always take the lead, the Sage alone takes the rear, never leading yet always following others. This can be called attaining the constant **Dao/Way** of victory.

Observing his writings, the discussions on softness overcoming hardness are numerous: some say "preserve softness," others say "attain softness," yet again, "do not dare to seize strength." Furthermore, "the overbearing will not attain their death," and in this passage, the principle of strength and weakness is elaborately expounded.

Zhuangzi said that to display meekness and humility as a facade is not the Dao/Way of dwelling below. Once, Confucius, when questioned by Zilu, spoke of strength and said, *"Be broad and gentle in teaching, but do not answer the unrighteous strength of the southern lands."* Could this too be the Dao/Way of preserving softness?

Who says that Master Lao’s teachings and Confucius’ Dao do not align?

**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Dao/Way of Heaven**

The Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?

The high are lowered, the low are raised; the overabundant are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation: The Dao/Way knows no gain or loss, but things have fullness and emptiness. It is poured into yet never overflows, measured yet never exhausted—this is what the Sage preserves.

When descending into things, Heaven and Earth fill and empty with the times, waxing and waning. How much more so for humanity?

The Dao/Way of Heaven attains perfection in balance, thus lowering the high so they do not exceed, raising the low so they do not fall short. Those who are about to come are advanced, those who have succeeded are withdrawn. The four seasons run their course, each in its proper order.

The *Cushui* commentary: The Dao/Way in the world is vast, encompassing all boundaries, yet subtle, penetrating to the core. Its use fills the six voids, yet when abandoned, none know its whereabouts—what gain or loss is there? When descending from the Dao/Way, it is confined by things, bound by *qi*, and transformed by *qi*’s fluctuations; it adheres to numbers and is governed by them. One fullness, one emptiness—none can escape this.

Only the Dao/Way transcends *qi* and numbers, becoming the mystery of all things. Thus, those with *qi* and numbers all draw from it without depletion. Hence, it is poured into yet never overflows; though added to, it does not increase. It is measured yet never exhausted; though diminished, it is not diminished further. The more it gives to others, the more one retains; the more it bestows, the more one possesses. This is what the Sage preserves—what humanity cannot abandon.

Moreover, within the realm, vast as Heaven and Earth are, when the Dipper shifts south, all things flourish; when it shifts north, all things wither. It wanes as it wanes, flourishes as it flourishes—sometimes waning, sometimes flourishing, moving with the times. Even the Dipper’s single star in the void cannot escape *qi* and numbers.

Thus, Heaven and Earth fill and empty, waxing and waning with the times. How much more so for humanity? Therefore, rise and decline succeed one another, completion and ruin follow in turn—this is the unalterable principle of nature.

Only the Dao/Way of Heaven follows reason and balance, thus nothing exists that does not attain the mean. If mountains are steep and barren while marshes grow fat, if waters recede from depths while trees wither their branches, if those who gnaw with teeth lose their horns, if those who flap with wings lose their feet—

The high fear their arrogance and are lowered to bend and conform, not exceeding to the point of excess. The low fear their meanness and are raised to stand and reach, not falling short. Those who are about to rise are advanced, those who have succeeded withdraw, like the four seasons: spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow. They shift without lingering, each in its proper order, all tending toward the mean.

Observe the Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?

The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation: Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time.

The *Cushui* commentary: The *Yijing* says: *"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and supplements humility."* Those who are full are diminished—this is diminishing the excessive. Those who are humble are supplemented—this is supplementing the deficient. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to balance through transformation.

The *Shujing* says: *"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time."* Could this be what is meant?

But the Dao/Way of humanity is not so. It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation: Human hearts push down the low and elevate the high, oppressing the solitary and fearing the eminent.

The *Cushui* commentary: What arises naturally is the Dao/Way of Heaven. What is forced is the Dao/Way of humanity. The two are vastly distant.

Since the Dao/Way of humanity is burdened by artificiality, human hearts are ever precarious, never at ease. The low are pushed further down, the high are raised further up, chasing after things in deference and subservience, lacking steadfast principle. Thus, they oppress the solitary and fear the eminent.

The solitary are pitiful—if they are oppressed, none encourage them to cultivate virtue and do good. Who will take their side? The eminent are contemptible—if they are feared, none punish them for deceit and wickedness. Who will restrain them? This is merely diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—how could they know the natural Dao/Way of Heaven?

Who among humanity can diminish the excessive and serve the deficient in the world? Only the Dao/Way.

Emperor Huizong’s annotation: It does not oppress the solitary, yet the impoverished receive from it. It does not fear the eminent, yet the wealthy are diminished by it. Only those with the Dao/Way can do this.

The *Cushui* commentary: The solitary are rejected and oppressed by the many. If one loves virtue, even if they are solitary and honored, they will be advanced and not oppressed—this is the impoverished receiving from it. The eminent are emulated and feared by the many. If one does not love virtue, even if they are eminent and high, they will be punished and diminished—this is the wealthy being taken from. Truly, this is the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way acts impartially, neither favoring one nor neglecting another. It universally responds, fittingly addressing all, balancing the unbalanced to attain balance. The Sage embodies this to govern the world—who would suffer from partiality and deceit?

Thus, to diminish the excessive and serve the deficient is not to align with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Who can achieve this?

Zhuangzi said: *"The Master is the Dao/Way of Heaven."* Therefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, accomplishes without claiming it—does this not mean they do not desire to be seen as virtuous?

Emperor Huizong’s annotation: They do not rely on their actions, so they have no pride in self-praise.

The Sage does not dwell on their accomplishments, hence they have no pride of self-satisfaction. While others adorn their intelligence, they alone appear as if foolish; while others seek victory, they alone yield and preserve themselves—all to avoid being seen as virtuous. Thus, they are always without loss, attaining the Dao/Way of Heaven.

**Exegesis says:** Within the utmost emptiness, transformation gives rise to all things. The Sage embodies this utmost emptiness to fulfill all desires—how could they rely on their actions?

They harmonize all things without claiming righteousness, bestow benefits upon all ages without claiming benevolence—who would have pride in self-praise? The birds called *zhì* (至) and *qù* (去) do this—how could they dwell on their accomplishments?

Though their achievements cover the world, they seem not to be their own; they abandon merit and fame, returning them to the people—who would have pride of self-satisfaction? This is what is meant by the "spirit-person without merit."

Abandoning cleverness and artifice, they follow the natural principles of Heaven. The virtuous person’s excellence is such that their appearance seems foolish—this is what is meant by *"while others adorn their intelligence, they alone appear as if foolish."*

They conform and adapt with things, blending like waves, accumulating countless small defeats into great victory—this is what is meant by *"while others seek victory, they alone yield and preserve themselves."* All this is because they do not desire to be seen as virtuous.

Did the Master of the Five Chariots (列御寇) reject the gift of five jars of wine because of this principle?

Because they do not desire to be seen as virtuous, they remain humble and gain benefit while always remaining without loss—this is how they attain the Dao/Way of Heaven.

Compared to those who adorn their intelligence, startle the foolish, refine their conduct, and reveal their purity—brightly shining like the sun and moon in their actions—who cannot avoid blame, the difference is vast.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak Conquer the World**

Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water, yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the firm and strong—this is because nothing can replace it.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The *Yijing* uses a well to symbolize nature, saying it does not change. Laozi says water is nearly the Dao/Way, because nothing can replace it.

If something could replace it, it would submit to others and lose itself—how could it conquer things? Only when nothing can replace it does it remain constant amid ten thousand changes, and nothing can conquer it.

**Exegesis says:** Water flows from the earth, passing through everywhere without obstruction; when dug, it becomes a well. The Dao/Way exists throughout the world, and when obtained, it becomes nature—thus, the *Yijing* uses a well to symbolize nature.

A well, when maintained, is never exhausted; though cities change, the well remains unchanged—this is because nature is constant, unaffected by nobility or lowliness, wisdom or foolishness. Though events vary without constancy, their essence does not change, just as a well does.

Heaven generates water from the One, and it is not far from the Dao/Way. It benefits all things, and all things receive its blessings and grace, yet it always remains in a state of softness, weakness, and non-contention. Among all things in the world, nothing can replace it—thus Laozi says water is nearly the Dao/Way, because nothing can replace it.

If things could replace it, then it would submit to others and lose its own nature—how could it attain the constant Dao/Way and conquer things? Only when nothing can replace it does it adapt to the terrain, becoming crooked or straight, and to the vessel, becoming square or round. Though it undergoes countless variations, it remains ever constant—truly, nothing can conquer it.

That the soft conquers the hard, the weak conquers the strong—this is known by all under Heaven, yet none can practice it.

**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** Though they know it, benevolence cannot guard it.

**Exegesis says:** Intelligence is used to exhaust principles; benevolence is used to fulfill nature. The affairs of the world are not difficult to understand, but difficult to practice. If intelligence is sufficient to exhaust principles but benevolence is insufficient to fulfill nature, then they weary of what they uphold and lack sincere perseverance—how could they practice it?

The soft conquering the hard, the weak conquering the strong—common people may have sufficient intelligence to know it, but they often fail because they do not firmly cultivate it. Though they know it, benevolence cannot guard it; even if they attain it, they will lose it—what benefit would this have?

The Classic says: *"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice, yet none under Heaven can know them, none can practice them."* This is in agreement.

The Sage thus speaks: *"To bear a state’s defilements is called the sovereign of the ancestral altars; to bear a state’s misfortunes is called the king of all under Heaven."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease; a ruler contains defilements, embodying the Dao’s emptiness, and thus what he receives is ever broader, becoming the refuge of all things, while his governance extends ever farther."*

The Classic says: *"To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven."*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"Water begins as a single ladle, yet accumulates to form rivers; thus the Yangtze and Yellow River gather waters to become vast. Earth begins as a single clod, yet accumulates to form fields; thus hills and mountains rise from lowly heaps to become lofty. When good deeds accumulate to form virtue, the divine clarity is naturally attained; the Sage’s heart flows accordingly, and so the great person harmonizes all to become the public good. What the *Classic of Transmission* says—‘Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease, a ruler contains defilements’—is precisely this.

Though a ruler’s undertakings may bring prosperity, his ascent to kingship is marked by the burden of what others flee. Hence, a king’s virtue lies in his capacity to receive. To be the king of all under Heaven, one must hold fullness without excess, preserve completion without loss—this is why one must bear the state’s misfortunes. This aligns with the Classic’s saying: *‘What people detest are solitude, widowhood, and barrenness, yet the king and duke take them as their calling.’*

To bear a state’s defilements and its misfortunes alike is to view honor and humiliation as one, without the heart of clinging or rejecting. In essence, it is only emptiness that can receive—hence the *Dao De Jing* says: *‘To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven.’* This is the ultimate rectitude.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Words are not confined to one meaning; what seems contrary to things is in harmony with the Dao—this is called the ultimate rectitude of all under Heaven."*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"How can the Dao exist without words, or words exist without the Dao? One and words are two; two and one become three. From this point onward, even the most cunning cannot grasp it—thus words are not confined to one meaning. Yet, when the ultimate words are spoken, the common words prevail, giving rise to debates like ‘Firm and White’ [over differing interpretations], where people are bewildered and do not know where to turn. Then all under Heaven begins to see ‘rectitude’ as contrary to things.

Only those who understand the resolution of words—though they seem contrary to things, yet harmonize with the Dao—can speak all day and exhaust the Dao. What could be more ultimate than this rectitude? This is what Zhuangzi meant when he said, *‘Parables are the true words.’*"

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**

*"To harmonize great grievances"* must leave lingering resentment—how then can it be called ‘good’?

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"Those who seek revenge do not break the spear; even those with vengeful hearts do not resent the windblown tile. Thus there is no lingering resentment."*

*"To love people is the root of harming them. To lay down arms is the root of creating them—how then can it be called ‘good’?"*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"The spear has no intent to harm, so those who seek revenge do not break it. The windblown tile has no intent to harm, so those with resentful hearts do not resent it. If one is always a judge or executioner, then people’s encounters with them are like the spear or the windblown tile—hence, all under Heaven is balanced, and there is no lingering resentment.

Moreover, benevolence loves people, so it hates those who harm them. Righteousness follows principle, so it hates those who disrupt order. If one uses cleverness to win favor, this is benevolence—yet it is the root of harming people. If one prohibits attacks and puts weapons to rest, this is laying down arms—yet it is the root of creating them. How then can harmonizing great grievances be truly good?

Thus the Sage holds only the left contract, and does not demand accountability from people."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"The Sage follows great transformation without obstruction, receiving and rejoicing in it—hence no demand for accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him. Contracts have left and right, distinguishing giving and taking. To hold the left contract is to give alone."*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"The Sage empties himself to traverse the world; though myriad appearances are diverse, his heart remains ever clear. Though myriad transformations differ, his heart remains ever still, responding naturally to all under Heaven’s ways. He simply follows this moment, and in emptiness and tranquility, there is nothing to obstruct or muddy. This is what Zhuangzi said: *‘To follow great transformation without obstruction.’*

Thus he can float in response, intoxicated by the flow, never rejecting people or severing things, yet suddenly standing in the realm of no affairs. To act without action, to govern without governance, to treat things without harming them—while things cannot harm him—is why he holds only the left contract and does not demand accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him.

In ancient times, governance was achieved by knotted cords; later sages replaced them with written contracts. Officials used them for administration, and the people used them for clarity. Yet contracts have left and right: the left for giving, the right for taking. To hold only the left contract is to engage in nothing but giving. Though he gives without demanding accountability from people, things come naturally, without needing to be coerced or trusted.

Thus there is one with virtue who oversees the contracts."*

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"To distribute with virtue is called sage."*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"Virtue in people is shared universally; it cannot be monopolized. The Sage adjusts and responds to it, his virtue extending broadly. Since his heart is naturally shared with all, he simply returns to distributing it—then people’s alignment with the contracts is naturally effortless."*

「Zhuangzi records Guanzi’s words as saying: *"To distribute virtue among the people is called sage."* This is precisely what was meant.

Moreover, Master Kong also said: *"The noble person purifies his words and aligns with the universal—then there is harmony; he refines his speech and conforms with the natural—then there is response."* His intent is the same.

But one without virtue cannot oversee the contracts.

The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"He who finds pleasure in universal harmony is not a Sage."*

One without virtue does not find his own fulfillment, yet he seeks the fulfillment of others. While he strives to make all things harmonize, he harbors both conciliatory and resentful emotions. This is the root of obstruction—what is called *蔽* [obstructed/blinded].

Zhuangzi says: *"Those who lose themselves in things are called the obstructed and blinded people."*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"The measure of things is boundless, yet he exhausts himself in seeking their harmony. His wisdom is strained, his spirit cannot keep pace—how could he not be constrained? The Sage transcends fixed knowledge and precedent, follows the natural Dao of Heaven, and aligns with the spontaneous flow of things without private favor. He responds only when moved, always out of necessity, not delight. How could he take pleasure in forcing harmony upon all?

Those who are blind to this cannot establish deep roots through virtue nor set firm boundaries with moderation. They chase after things and forget their own path, failing to find their own fulfillment yet seeking that of others. They labor endlessly, striving only for universal harmony, while harboring both conciliatory and resentful emotions—this is the very essence of obstruction, the *蔽蒙* [blinded and deluded]. Thus, when Zhuangzi says, *'He who finds pleasure in universal harmony is not a Sage,'* is he not correct?

For obstruction means he cannot see clearly, and delusion means he lacks understanding. Burdened by things and hindered, who could truly diminish substance for harmony or attain emptiness for clarity?

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites—it always aligns with the good. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *"If one is good, then Heaven aids him—what favoritism is there?"*

The *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *"Heaven follows natural principles—what is near or distant? Heaven has no partiality—what does it give or take? Though it does not relax in giving or taking, its response is based on things, and it aids only the good."*

For the wisdom of Heaven originates from the wisdom of the people. The good follow their own path, and the people follow them—thus it is fitting that Heaven always aids the good.

The *Book of Documents* says: *"Do good and Heaven will bestow a hundred blessings."* It also says: *"The August Heaven has no favorites—it aids only those with virtue."*

For when accumulated goodness forms virtue, Heaven has reason to aid them. This passage speaks of holding the left contract and ultimately aligning with the Dao of Heaven, to show how the Sage’s Way harmonizes with Heaven’s.

This is why the poem in *Dongzhuo* [洞酌] says, *'The August Heaven favors those with virtue and nourishes those who follow the Way.'*

From the *Small States, Few People* chapter, verse eighty:

*"Small states, few people..."*

Huizong’s annotation states: *"When lands are vast and populations numerous, governance cannot keep pace with demands, wisdom cannot discern all matters, and virtue declines while punishments arise—thus the chaos of later ages begins here."* Laozi, at the end of the Zhou, weary of its disorder, sought the original Dao and embedded this intent in his text, aiming to counter the excesses of ornate culture and restore simplicity. Hence, he spoke of *"small states, few people."*

Indeed, in the age of supreme virtue—from Róngchéng to Shénnóng, with twelve sovereigns renowned for perfect governance—this was their very essence.

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"Under Heaven’s vast expanse, all is the king’s land; within its borders, all are the king’s subjects."* Yet why, despite such boundless territory, does Laozi advocate for small states and sparse populations? For when lands expand and people multiply, cunning and deceit flourish, tasks proliferate beyond governance, and wisdom, clouded by artifice, fails to discern truth. Moral decay and licentiousness ensue, offenses multiply, and transgressions defy prohibition—thus the root of later disorder.

Laozi, pitying the decay of contemporary customs, traced the origins of virtue and illuminated profound truths. Through his text, he sought to dismantle the superficial and restore the pure simplicity of antiquity, consolidating scattered elements into unity and stripping away ornamentation to reveal substance. Thus, he spoke of *"small states, few people."*

From Róngchéng, Dàtíng, to Fúxī, and Shénnóng—twelve sovereigns celebrated for perfect governance—also governed by ensuring the people lacked knowledge and desire. In harmony with ignorance, their virtue remained untainted; in harmony with desirelessness, they embodied pristine simplicity. Such was the age of perfect order.

Laozi’s teachings aimed to return the people to this primordial state, hence his emphasis on this principle. He sought to render the people’s abundant tools useless:

Huizong’s annotation: *"Unity without factionalism, free from the burdens of crowds."*

The *Cushui* commentary elaborates:
*"The people possess innate nature—weaving cloth for garments, tilling fields for sustenance—this is called shared virtue. Since their virtue aligns, they need no external comparisons, and self-sustenance suffices. This is unity without factionalism."*

Unity lies in shared nature, while factionalism arises from unnecessary comparisons. When united yet uncompared, they dissolve into the boundless, and the people, until death, do not interact. Even with abundant tools, they find no use for them—how much less the burden of crowds?

Thus, the Sage detests crowds, for crowds breed factionalism. Shun, though thrice relocating to Chengdu, settled at Deng’s ruins with ten thousand households, yet his joy in governance knew no end. When crowds gathered, he welcomed them—Shun could not refuse. Yet such responses were but responses to dust and dross, the remnants of imperial affairs. To wield the world yet remain detached, achieving effortless governance—who but the most divine could do so?

He made death precious, so the people did not flee.

Huizong’s annotation: *"Life brings them joy, death offers burial—thus the people do not lightly abandon their land."*

Confucius said: *"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so."* Is this not the meaning of fleeing?

The *Cushui* commentary explains:
*"The people’s greatest concern is to live and die without regret. If life brings joy—honoring parents and nurturing offspring with provision—if death offers burial—garments, coffins, and grave goods are assured—then where is the delight in life or the sorrow in death? How could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?"*

In Zhou’s heyday, the six provisions sustained the people, ensuring the poor were relieved, and the six customs secured them, guaranteeing ancestral burial. Five clans aided in mutual assistance, four neighborhoods shared funeral rites. Plowing together in fields, dwelling in shared quarters, laboring in common enterprises, defending against shared harms—thus the people did not lightly abandon their land. How much more so in a virtuous realm, where the people are simple and unspoiled, private desires few, and cravings scarce! With no paths through mountains, no bridges across marshes, how could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?

Yet gathering them posed no difficulty: love them, and they grow close; benefit them, and they assemble. Govern through what they hate, and they disperse. The reason ancient peoples valued life and did not flee was that their rulers upheld the Way, loving and benefiting them.

Confucius said: *"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so."* Thus, if the people do not flee, it is because the Way is upheld. Though chariots and arms exist, they serve no purpose.

Huizong’s annotation states: *"Mountains without paths or tunnels, marshes without boats or bridges—this is akin to the people having no knowledge, yet their virtue remains unbroken. Without traces of perilous obstacles, even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon; without signs of warfare, even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy."*

The *Shu yi* commentary explains: *"Beyond natural inclinations, there is nothing but material things. When these things become one’s companions, then external pursuits become one’s primary concern. Cravings and calculations multiply, and the people wander and flee without end. If one seeks to draw them far away, then mountains must be carved with paths and tunnels to make passage possible; if one seeks to traverse difficulties, then marshes must be bridged with boats and ferries to be navigated. Even if one wishes to rest and leave no trace, it cannot be achieved. Only in an age of supreme virtue do the people return to their original nature: mountains lack paths or tunnels, marshes lack boats or bridges, yet they do not travel between one another. Their ignorance is like that of infants—dwelling without knowing what to do, moving without knowing where to go. Simple and tranquil, they leave no record of perilous obstacles, so even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon. Forgetting distinctions and judgments, they know no signs of warfare, so even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy. Thus, each finds contentment in their natural endowments alone.*

*If one were to restore the use of knotted cords for governance, Huizong’s annotation says: *"It is merely a record of essentials, requiring no written contracts."* The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *"The governance of the world must have some means to preserve and transmit enduring clarity for future generations. Thus, in the upper antiquity, knotted cords were used to rule, while later sages replaced them with written contracts, saying that words alone cannot fully record all matters, so they are verified by written texts; deeds alone cannot fully establish trust, so they are supplemented by seals. But when governance reaches its peak of effortless action, when the people are pure and affairs are simple, then bonds need not be enforced with glue or ropes. People act in accordance without needing to be bound by rules—even if knotted cords were used to record essentials, it would suffice to win the trust of the world. Why then require the meticulous detail of written contracts and seals to prevent deceit among the people? Thus, restoring the use of knotted cords is to return the people to the age of primordial simplicity.*

*They find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their customs settled, and their occupations joyful. Huizong’s annotation explains: *"They till the fields to eat, weave to clothe themselves, carry food in their mouths while playing, and drum their bellies in leisure—these are the people’s natural capacities. They are content with their portion, so their food is sweet; they reject ornamentation, so their clothing is fine; they are undisturbed, so their customs are settled; they preserve life, so their occupations are joyful."*

*The *Shu yi* commentary further clarifies: *"When the people return to their original nature, they abandon superficiality and focus on the essentials, spurning useless labor and valuing only practical matters. Their livelihood depends solely on farming and sericulture. Thus, when they till the fields to eat, the grain is unified under cultivation; when they weave to clothe themselves, the silk is unified under spinning. They rise with the sun and rest with the setting of it, with no need for cleverness or skill—only daily sustenance matters, so they carry food in their mouths while playing. Harm and benefit do not unsettle them; they simply adapt to their own ease, so they drum their bellies in leisure. The people’s essential tasks are fulfilled here, and beyond these four matters—sweet food, fine clothing, settled customs, and joyful occupation—there are no further concerns. Sweet food lies in moderation, not in aversion to eating; fine clothing lies in simplicity, not in adornment. Settled customs come from non-interference, free from reckless action. Joyful occupation lies in self-sufficiency, without covetous desires. Without the people returning to their original nature, how could this state be attained?*

*Even neighboring nations gaze upon one another, and the sounds of chickens and dogs intermingle, yet the people live to old age and death without ever visiting one another. Huizong’s annotation says: *"Their dwellings are close, their voices heard, yet they do not travel between one another. At that time, there were no cravings or desires, no artificial actions—only constant spontaneity. This is what is called supreme virtue."*

*The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *"Their dwellings are close, yet their paths are not marked by interaction. Their voices are heard, yet their places are distant in spirit. It is fitting that they protect and aid one another, share resources and welcome guests. But even when they reach a state of serene forgetfulness, living to old age and death without ever traveling between one another, it is because they do not know the distinctions that govern interaction—thus, there is no interaction at all. Though mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges, it is so. When their nature returns to simplicity and desire vanishes, their hearts forget material things and seek nothing—only constant spontaneity. What else could this be but supreme virtue?"*

*Laozi, in the chapter on ‘The Supreme Ultimate,’ says: *"The people say of me that I am effortless."* Indeed, having already spoken of the governance of the Supreme Ultimate as effortless, it is clear that in an age of supreme virtue, the people act without artificial means yet remain constantly spontaneous. There is no doubt of this.

*The chapter on ‘Faithful Words Are Not Beautiful’ (81):*
*"Faithful words are not beautiful,*

「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"When the Dao emerges in speech, it is bland to the point of tastelessness, yet it does not shame even the hundred sages nor decay through the ten thousand ages."*

*The Commentary explains: *"The Dao is not mere words; without words, its profundity cannot be revealed. Words are not the Dao; without the Dao, their foundation cannot be established. When the Dao manifests in words, it is bland yet without taste, rooted in principle and meaning—far beyond the sweetness of coarse grains and the beauty of rich delicacies. It can be practiced to verify truth and examined to resolve doubts. When combined, it aligns like matching seals; when upright, it is easy to follow. Thus, it does not shame even the hundred sages. When firm as metal and stone, it is essential yet easy to uphold. Thus, it endures through the ten thousand ages without flaw. If so, then faithful words grounded in the Dao—what need is there for them to be beautiful? Beautiful words lack faithfulness."*

*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"‘Proper speech’ is ornate; those who indulge in elaborate rhetoric use mere embellishments as their core, thus lacking faithfulness."*

*The Commentary explains: *"Ornate speech lacks substance; what lacks substance is merely empty. Thus, ornate speech is empty, while profound speech is real. Indulging in elaborate rhetoric leads to words that fail to convey truth, using mere embellishments as their core, thus failing to grasp the essence. If such is the case, then the farther one strays from the Dao. Though the end may still be called ‘speech’ and the Dao may be exhausted, it is enough to please those who seek beauty in sound—yet where is the substance to demonstrate faithfulness? Thus, it lacks faithfulness."*

*"The good do not argue,*
*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"Speech should emphasize essence and principle."*

*The Commentary explains: *"When one attains completeness, it is called ‘essence’; when all essences converge, it is called ‘principle.’ Speech that upholds essence and principle as its standard achieves the fullness of the Dao and contributes to ultimate truth. When such speech is established, it is always appropriate. Though it does not rely on elaborate argumentation, its profound meaning is fully preserved—enough to satisfy what people desire to hear. This is what is meant by ‘the good do not argue.’ Formerly, Confucius examined the Twelve Classics and said: ‘The essence lies in the Seven Meanings.’ Mencius, who followed Confucius, when pressed for words, said: ‘Do I truly enjoy argumentation?’ His words were: ‘I study extensively and explain in detail, only to return to concise speech.’ Yet Yang Xiong said: ‘The essence of speech is conciseness.’ Is this not the meaning of ‘the good do not argue’? Argumentation is not good."*

*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"Excessive elaboration leads to many digressions, straying from the Dao’s ultimate correctness."*

*The Commentary explains: *"Excessive speech exhausts itself; it is better to uphold the middle. Indeed, the labor of argumentation is like that of a mosquito—far from the Dao’s ultimate correctness. As for Gongsun Long’s sophistry and Hui Shi’s manifold schemes, it is merely the toil of a mosquito. This is why argumentation is not good."*

*"The wise are not learned,*
*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"To grasp the subtleties of the Dao, one must return to its simplicity."*

*The Commentary explains: *"The Dao’s simplicity does not complicate; those who know its subtleties understand it in a single word, preserving it in direct perception. A little suffices—why seek learning? The Classic says: ‘What is learned yet unnamed is called subtlety.’ Exploring subtlety reveals its formless, hidden nature. Only when one returns to simplicity and speaks to the extreme can this be known. Zhuangzi says: ‘Knowledge of it is shallow; ignorance of its depth is profound.’ The learned do not know. The Emperor Huizong annotates: ‘What is heard and seen is less valuable than simplicity.’ Zhuangzi says: ‘Learning is not necessary for knowledge; argumentation is not necessary for wisdom.’ The Commentary explains: ‘When studying the Dao, one must daily diminish. The Dao’s formless realm is perceived only by the spirit, its soundless expanse only by the qi. Vision and hearing do not depend on the ears and eyes—why value the multitude of what is heard and seen? The good progressors of the Dao say: ‘Uphold simplicity’ and ‘speak concisely.’ Indeed, ‘it is better to uphold simplicity.’ Laozi, in response to Confucius’ inquiry about the ultimate Dao, also said: ‘The learned do not know; the argumentative are not wise.’ Thus, the subtleties of knowing the Dao are not attained through mere learning and observation—this is clear."*

*"The Sage has no accumulation,*
*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"There is accumulation; thus, it is insufficient. There is no hoarding; thus, there is abundance."*

*Zhuangzi says: *"The Dao of the Sage flows without accumulation."*

*Confucius says: *"I thus daily depart."*

*The Commentary explains: *"The Dao’s ultimate emptiness has never contained anything. Things are boundless, all confined within the Dao. The Dao is obscure in its nothingness, thus empty yet responsive; things are stagnant in their existence, yet how much do they differ? Like grass in its growth, it is taken as if it would never end, yet when gathered, it is sometimes exhausted. This is accumulation—thus, it is insufficient. But emptiness without accumulation is different. Like a mirror reflecting forms, all beauty and ugliness are revealed; like a valley echoing sounds, all goodness and evil are answered. This is why there is no hoarding, yet there is abundance. The Sage embodies the Dao’s ultimate emptiness, flowing without accumulation. Six senses and four limbs—there is nothing the Sage is not present in. Responding in time, it is merely the remnants of the Dao, never obstructing reality. Thus, the Sage can manifest in transformation and stand alone in heaven. Zhuangzi, in his discussion of the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of the Emperor, and the Dao of the Sage, all said: ‘It flows without accumulation.’ This is the case. Confucius attained this Dao, reaching boundless freedom and leaving no trace. It was not merely received and preserved—his form did not change until its end. Thus, he said: ‘I thus daily depart.’ Though he has departed, how could he be lost in mere emptiness and stillness, preventing students from entering his gate? He simply does not cling to traces of existence, offering them instead to forget in nothingness. Though he forgets the past ‘I,’ there is an ‘I’ that does not forget. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he becomes ever more plentiful."*

*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *"The good are generous and complete, yet never exhausted. All things borrow from them without depletion."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Dao reaches the utmost non-being, yet fulfills all things’ demands. It is poured into without overflowing, drawn from without exhaustion, and suffices all things without ever being depleted. All things flourishing between Heaven and Earth, their growth and formation—all draw from it without depletion, for it moves yet never accumulates.

The Sage attains the Dao, yet never hoards it for himself. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he ever more plentiful. Responding to the myriad needs from the foundation of emptiness and stillness, his embrace is boundless and all-encompassing, taking as needed and always sufficient—how could it not be amply abundant?

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.

*The Emperor Huizong annotates:* *"Only the *Qian* [Creative] can benefit all under Heaven with its beauty. Though it does not speak of what it benefits, all things are truly benefited, and there is never any harm."*

The *Explanatory Commentary* states: *Qian* is the Dao of Heaven. Great indeed is the primal *Qian*! All things draw their origin from it. Its transformative mechanism subtly shifts within the boundless void—it opens and gives birth, extends and circulates, and through this, all things are formed. All precious treasures flourish in the grand assembly of *Heng* [Abundance] and *Jia* [Auspiciousness], none but the beauty of benefiting all under Heaven.

The *Odes* sing of abundant harvests, saying: *"Much millet, much glutinous rice."* For millet thrives in high, dry, and cold places, while glutinous rice favors low, moist, and hot conditions. Speaking of them as "much" reveals Heaven’s beneficence knows no limits—though it does not name what it benefits, the benefit is inherent.

Zhuangzi said: *"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty, yet do not speak of their beneficence."* How then could there be any harm?

The Sage’s Dao acts yet does not contend.

*The Emperor Huizong annotates:*
*"It follows without opposing; its motion is like water.
It responds without hoarding; its stillness is like a mirror.
It harmonizes without leading; its response is like an echo.
Though it acts, its action arises from non-action—it embodies Heaven itself. What contention could there be?"*

This virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.

The *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Sage applies the Dao to all under Heaven, nurturing things according to their nature, aiding their spontaneous unfolding. Thus, it follows without opposing, its motion like water—what is called *"timely action."* Supplying all demands, it effortlessly transforms from non-being to being; responding without hoarding, its stillness is like a *yín* [balance scale]—what is called *"steadfast stillness."* Attending to things’ responses, gentle and still in itself, it harmonizes without initiating—its response is like an echo—what is called *"preserving the feminine."* These three aspects, within oneself without attachment, let things manifest naturally. It is neither non-action nor action, but non-action that encompasses all action.

Though establishing myriad laws, its action stems from non-action. Abandoning cleverness and fixed ways, it follows Heaven’s natural order.

The Dao of Heaven is a single *qi* in motion, all things flourishing in abundance. It acts without effort yet remains ever clear, conquers without contention. The Sage embodies Heaven to govern the world, playing with the Creator—its Dao is subtle yet vast, in motion weaving the myriad realms, in stillness mirroring Heaven and Earth. Universally responsive yet never at odds, thus it acts without contending. This virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.

Laozi, in concluding the *Classic of Virtue*, speaks of aligning with the Dao, for the Dao in others is called *dao*, while the Dao within is called *de*. Virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao; only when virtue advances beyond the Dao can one speak of its utmost expression. When Dao and virtue reach this state, is not the intent of the *Classic* profound?

I have often reflected: Though the Dao is unspeakable and hidden, it is not as clear as when spoken. Laozi, pitying the excess of rhetoric in his time, sought to restore the purity of Heaven and Earth and the essence of antiquity. To return to the primal simplicity, he composed ninety-nine chapters, elucidating the intent of Dao and virtue to awaken all under Heaven and future generations. He spoke only when necessary, hence in the final passage, he explains his purpose in writing the *Classic*: *"Faithful words are not ornate; eloquent speakers are not virtuous,"* urging students to delve beyond the words to grasp their mystery, transcending speech itself.

Like Zhuangzi’s *Book* concluding with the *Heaven Down*, it delves deeply into the origin of the Great Dao, forcefully rejecting the obfuscations of a hundred schools. He himself claimed his writing was "erratic and absurd," loosening the traces of his composition.

Examining the *Zhuzi*, none surpass Zhuangzi in wisdom to comprehend Laozi. Their works complement each other—how could it be merely a matter of verbal artistry?

Tracing his critique of the Six Classics, they reduce to the *Odes’* aspirations, the *Documents’* deeds, the *Rites’* practices, the *Music’* harmony, and the *Changes’* yin-yang, along with the *Spring and Autumn’*s distinctions of rank—hardly confined to pedantic commentary. Thus, the truly wise are not merely erudite.

Yet when discussing the varied excellences of myriad arts—from Mozi downward to Huishi’s multifarious schemes—his *Five Cartloads* of writings are contradictory and inconsistent, ever more distant from the Dao. This reveals that extensive knowledge without insight is blind.

Speaking of the Sage’s non-accumulation through emptiness, it is clear that giving to others increases his abundance, sharing with others multiplies his plenty.

Observing the Sage nurture all things and harmonize the world, he must take Heaven as his standard, demonstrating the Dao’s beneficence without harm.

Observing the establishment of the ever-present non-being, it must be expressed through gentle, weak, humble, and lowly conduct, revealing the Sage’s Dao acts without contending.

Though Laozi and Zhuangzi’s words differ, their Dao resonates without explicit agreement. Examining their concluding intent, this is the true grasp. Respectfully submitted.

*The Explanatory Commentary on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes here, Volume Fourteen.
