# 南华真经章句音义

**Preface to the *Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi* (Exegetical Notes and Phonetic Glosses on the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*)**
By Bixuzi

The Grand Historian states: Zhuangzi once served as the warden of Meng’s Lacquer Garden and composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters. The *Han Shu: Yiwen Zhi* records fifty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi*. The *Sui Shu: Jingji Zhi* notes Xiang Xiu’s commentary in twenty fascicles, Guo Xiang’s in thirty-three fascicles, and further that Liang Qian compiled the *Nanhua Lun* in twenty-five fascicles. Tao Hongjing’s preface to the *Zhen’gao* states: Zhuangzi received esoteric teachings from Master Changsang and composed the seven *Inner Chapters*, each titled with three characters—modeled after the revolving jade rings of the celestial sphere and the radiant brilliance of the Three Luminaries. Thus, when Hongjing composed the *Zhen’gao*, he arranged it into seven sections, likewise using three-character headings. His writings evidently followed this tradition.

During the Tianbao era of the Tang, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work should retain its former title, *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*, from which we know the significance of *Nanhua* has endured since antiquity. From my youth, I have delighted in reciting this scripture. When not occupied with worldly affairs, I would unroll the scroll and read—such is the vocation of Daoists, who seek longevity and enduring vision, forgetting both praise and blame while trusting in the Dao. How can this be compared to those who rely on external conditions?

Now, I have compiled exegetical notes, dividing the text into seven fascicles. This involves parsing chapters and distinguishing sentences, tracing the intricate branches of its discourse. The seven *Inner Chapters*—*Free and Easy Wandering*, *On the Equality of Things*, *The Secret of Caring for Life*, *The Human World*, *Signs of Full Virtue*, *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, and *Fit for Emperors and Kings*—are the very ones named by the Lacquer Garden master. The remaining chapters take their titles from the first two or three characters of each, comprising fifteen *Outer Chapters* and eleven *Miscellaneous Chapters*. Some claim the *Outer* and *Miscellaneous Chapters* were edited by Guo Xiang. However, Tao Hongjing states that Zhuangzi authored the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters* without mentioning the *Miscellaneous*. Examining earlier commentaries, I find them often cursory and difficult to verify. Here, I have selected twenty-six chapters, using two-character headings for those that form complete sections—*Webbed Toes*, *Horses’ Hooves*, *Opening Trunks*, *Engraving Intent*, *Mending Nature*, *Discourse on Swords*, and *The Old Fisherman*—to pair with the *Inner Chapters* as the *Outer Chapters*. The remaining nineteen—*Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *In the Realm of*, *Heaven and Earth*, *The Way of Heaven*, *The Revolution of Heaven*, *Autumn Floods*, *Perfect Happiness*, *Mastering Life*, *The Mountain Tree*, *Master Tian*, *Knowledge Wanders North*, *Gengsang Chu*, *Xu Wugui*, *Zeyang*, *External Things*, *Parables*, *Lie Yukou*, and *The World*—alternate like odd and even numbers, their titles drawn from figures or events, their principles aligning with the numerology of yin and yang, their meanings resonating with the subtleties of speech and silence. Thus, they are called the *Miscellaneous Chapters*.

Within these thirty-three chapters, I have divided the text into 250 sections, assigning titles based on their themes, designating them as *Zhangju* (Exegetical Notes). Beneath each section, I provide phonetic glosses, exegetical explanations, and clarifications of allusions, labeling them as *Zhangyi* (Sectional Meanings). Upon completion, I tallied the characters in the main text, totaling 65,923—four-tenths fewer than Sima Qian’s record. I further collated the *Baowen Tonglu* from the Central Taiyi Palace, which contained several versions of the *Zhuangzi*, along with hand-copied manuscripts from my satchel. Comparing these with the 1004 edition printed by the Directorate of Education, I found 349 discrepancies. Additionally, I consulted other commentaries to address lacunae and errors in one fascicle, resolving doubts and including three chapters by Gongsun Long for reference.

Alas! Later scholars are unfortunate not to witness the complete bamboo slips of the Lacquer Garden or grasp the grand purport of its chapters—its profound insights have gradually been fragmented by various schools.

Composed on the Lantern Festival of the Jiazi year of the Yuanfeng era.

**Nanhua Zhenjing Zhangju Yinyi, Fascicle One**

Zhuangzi’s surname was Zhuang, his given name Zhou, and he was also styled Zixiu. A native of Mengcheng in Song, he lived contemporaneously with King Hui of Liang and King Wei of Qi. He once served as the Keeper of the Lacquer Garden. His teacher was Gongsun Long, from whom he received esoteric teachings. He composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, which he titled *Nanhua*. His scholarship was rooted in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he also studied under the Chu master Juan Yuan. Later, he secluded himself on Mount Baodu, where he ingested the Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir, ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and was appointed as a Compiling Gentleman in the Pavilion of the Supreme Ultimate. On the fourth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the Minister of the Court Pei Guangting requested the canonization of the Four Masters. On the twentieth day of the second month in the first year of the Tianbao era, an imperial edict decreed that Zhuangzi’s work retain its original title, *Nanhua Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Nanhua*); Wenzi’s work be titled *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Pervading Mystery*); Liezi’s work be titled *Chongxu Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Soaring Emptiness*); and Gengsangzi’s work be retitled *Dongling Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of Penetrating Spirit*). The title *Nanhua* signifies the radiance of separation, the flourishing essence that reveals the subtleties of the Dao.

**Inner Chapters: "Free and Easy Wandering" (1)**
The seven titles of the Inner Chapters were bestowed by the Lacquer Garden. Only when one is free of self can merit and fame dissolve, and only then may one speak of "free and easy wandering." The *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter is placed first because, though it strides beyond the mundane, it still harbors pride and boasting, and thus is followed by *The Equality of Things*. "Equality" means forgetting things to achieve self-equality; those who have not yet attained equality still engage in debates of self and other. When self and other revolve in cycles, entering the emptiness within the cycle brings equality. Those who equalize through emptiness have yet to recognize the master of life and death, so this is followed by *The Secret of Caring for Life*. The "master" is the true lord of spirit and bone. The body is like firewood, and the master is like fire. One who preserves fire relies on firewood, but when the firewood is exhausted, the fire dies. Only the adept in nurturing remains unaware of its end. Yet there are those who shine alone and cannot join the multitude, so this is followed by *The World of Men*. One who dwells in filth without contamination excels in harmonizing light and dust, and by harmonizing with dust, one attains virtue, hence the next chapter, *The Sign of Fullness of Virtue*. When virtue takes form, things are forgotten. Only those who remain obscure preserve their talents in full, and with talents complete, one may become a teacher, hence *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. The true teacher is none other than the perfected person. How could the perfected person possess a heart-mind? Without a heart-mind, one may assist in the transformations of creation, hence *Responding to Emperors and Kings*. Emperors and kings are the source of the great Dao, the masters of teaching and transformation, occupying one of the Four Greatnesses and presiding as the most honored over the myriad things. Vast and profound, their appearance cannot be fathomed by physiognomists. The chapters from *Webbed Toes* onward lack distinct thematic significance and are arranged to elaborate and amplify the subtleties of the seven Inner Chapters.

**Annotations on "Free and Easy Wandering"**
*Beiming* (Northern Darkness) is also written as *溟* (*míng*), pronounced like *觅经* (*mì jīng*). Xi Kang states it signifies "boundless and vast."

When the *Kun* grows large, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.

*Peng* (鵬) was originally written as *朋* (*péng*), implying the meaning of "companionship," hence its sound does not differ from other birds. It signifies "a flock of companions." When the *Peng* takes flight, it spans thousands of *li* without measure.

*Nanming* (Southern Darkness) refers to the Southern Sea, analogous to *Beiming* (Northern Darkness).

*Cháo jūn* (朝菌) is pronounced *qí yǔn* (其陨切). Sima [Biao] says it is "dog's ear fungus," growing on dung in overcast weather and perishing at sunrise. Also called *bái jí* (白及), it knows neither the beginning nor the end of a month. Cui [Yun] says it is a dung-born fungus, sprouting at dawn and dying by dusk—those that appear at dusk do not live to see the next dawn, and those that appear at dawn do not live to see dusk. Zhi Dun says it is the morning glory, blooming at dawn and withering by dusk. Pan Ni says it is the "platform of ten thousand trees." The *Wen* text calls it a "suddenly sprouting fungus." *Huì* (晦) means "darkness," and *shuò* (朔) means "dawn."

*Huì* (蟪) is pronounced *huì* (惠). *Gū* (蛄) is pronounced *gū* (姑). Sima [Biao] says *huì gū* (蟪蛄) is the winter cicada, also called *dì liáo* (蝭蟧). Those born in spring die in summer, and those born in summer die in autumn. Cui [Yun] calls it *diāo liáo* (蛁蟧). Some say it is the mountain cicada—those that sing in spring do not live to autumn, and those that sing in autumn do not live to winter. The *Chu Ci* calls it the "cold cicada," while others say it is the summer cicada, born in wheat stalks (also called *mài jié* [麦节]), living from summer to autumn. Thus, it knows neither spring nor autumn.

*Míng líng* (冥灵) was originally written as *míng* (榠). Li [Yi] says it is the name of a tree growing in Jiangnan, where the sprouting of leaves marks spring and their falling marks autumn. This tree counts two thousand years as one year. *Dà chūn* (大椿) is pronounced *chǒu lún* (丑伦切). Li [Yi] says it grows in Jiangnan, while others say it grows in the north. This tree counts thirty-two thousand years as one year. "This is a great span of years"—this line was originally missing in the *Chengben*.

Peng Zu, as recorded by Cheng [Gong], was surnamed *Jiān* (籛) and named *Kēng* (铿), a distant descendant of Emperor Ku. Skilled in nurturing life and regulating the cauldron, he presented pheasant soup to Yao. Yao, recognizing his mastery of flavors and thus his ability to cultivate life, believed one who could nurture life could also nurture others, and enfeoffed him at Pengcheng. His Way was worthy of being ancestral, hence the name Peng Zu. He lived through the Xia and Shang dynasties into the Zhou, reaching eight hundred years of age.

*Tè wén* (特闻) in Cui’s version reads *dài wén* (待闻). *Jí biàn xiāo yáo* (极变逍遥):

The *Tang Shi Ji* states that in the system of posthumous names, "Tang" means "to eliminate cruelty and remove tyranny." A descendant of Emperor Ku and scion of Xie, [Tang] was surnamed *Zi* (子) and named *Tiān Yǐ* (天乙). Possessing sagely virtue, he banished Jie to Nanchao.

*Jí* (棘) was a worthy of the Tang era, a man of vast knowledge. *Qióng fà* (穷发): Cui [Yun] says it is the barren northern land without vegetation, where mountains take grass and trees as their "hair."

Sima [Biao] says they are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. *Zhī biàn* is pronounced *píng miǎn* (平免切). *Biàn* means "to transform."

He was the son of Emperor Ku, surnamed Yī Qí (伊祁), styled Fàngxūn (放勋), and possessed sagely virtue. At fifteen, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Tang; at twenty-one, he ascended the imperial throne and established his capital at Pingyang. After seventy years of rule, he found Shun, and after twenty more years, he retired. Shun then administered the Son of Heaven’s governance, recommending Yao to Heaven. Yao abdicated for a total of twenty-eight years. He lived to one hundred and eighteen, ruled for ninety-eight years, and upon his death was buried in Yangcheng. In the *Book of Songs*, he is associated with the state of Tang.

Cheng says the *yǎn-shǔ* is the size of an ox, with a reddish-black color like a river deer, its ears resembling three overlapping shells, a white-tipped tail, and a habit of entering rivers to drink. The *Jīnlóuzǐ* states that in the borders of Jìnníng County, large rats appear, resembling oxen, which the locals call *yǎn-shǔ*. When disaster is imminent, these rats emerge from the mountains to roam the fields, shedding their fur, which transforms entirely into small rats, consuming all five grains.

The *páo-rén* is pronounced *bāo jiāo* (鲍交切), referring to the kitchen steward. The *Rites of Zhou* includes the office of *páo-rén*.

A worthy recluse of Chǔ, he lived contemporaneously with Confucius but feigned madness and refused office, often tilling the land himself. The King of Chǔ sent an envoy with a hundred *yì* of gold and two teams of four horses to summon him, but he did not respond. Thereupon, he carried his wife on his back and wandered among mountains and seas, their end unknown.

He was the sixth-generation descendant of Emperor Zhuān Xū. His father was called Gǔ Sǒu, and his mother, Wò Dēng, conceived him after perceiving a great rainbow. He was born at Yáo Xū and thus took the surname Yáo. Born by the Guǐ River, he was also called the Guǐ clan. His eyes bore double pupils, so he was styled Chóng Huá. His filial piety and benevolence were renowned in his village. Yáo, hearing of his virtue, wed him to his two daughters and enfeoffed him at Yú. At twenty, his filial piety was widely known; at thirty, he oversaw all government affairs; at fifty, he acted as regent for the Son of Heaven; at fifty-eight, Yáo passed away; and at sixty-one, he succeeded Yáo as emperor. His capital was at Pú Jī—some say Píng Yáng, others Pān Pān (now in Shàng Gǔ).

The Yellow Emperor is the sagely ancestor and celestial honored one of our dynasty.

In secular records, it is said of Us that We spoke at birth and later attained the Dao to ascend to heaven."

*Tīng chì* is pronounced *dìng qiè*. *Yíng* is pronounced *yú jiǒng qiè*. To acknowledge the Dao as wondrous and eternal is like perceiving jade’s hue by listening with the ear.

*Shíyè* refers to the rooster’s ability to mark the hours of the night. *Jiàn* is pronounced *tú dàn qiè*. *Xiāo* is pronounced *yú jiāo qiè*.

The *Máo Shī Cǎo Mù Shū* states: "It is large or small like a turtledove, green in color, and its flesh is most savory—well suited for roasting." The *Běn Cǎo Shí Yí* by Chén Cángqì notes: "The *xiāo* was prized by the ancients for its roasted meat, which was surely rich and fine. It is also called *xiāo*, *xiū*, or by the people of Wú as *□hún*—an ill-omened bird of harsh cry." Jiǎ Yí writes: "The *péng* resembles the *xiāo*, though they are in fact the same creature." Another name is *yú hú*, an inauspicious bird.

*Zhī xī* is pronounced *xī*, meaning "what." *Shěn* means "to discern what sound." *Bó* is pronounced *bó* or *bó* (as in *bó zàng*, "meager burial," or *bó guāng*, "dim light"). *Yī* means "clothing." *Xié* is pronounced *dié*.

Silent and self-serving—such is the manner of private gain, like a thief’s hoarding for himself. *Diào* is read as written: to mourn the living is *yàn*; to mourn the dead, *diào*. *Guǐ* is pronounced *jiǔ wěi*; its gloss reads *xiè*. This refers to encounters at dawn or dusk. The master of the Dao, viewing ten thousand generations as but a dawn or dusk, mirrors the *Shíyíjì* of Wáng Zǐnián: "The fusang tree withers once in ten thousand years—mortals see it as fleeting as dawn or dusk." Such is its kind.

To equalize the same and the different—*nán àn* is pronounced *àn*, meaning obscure and unclear, as Lǐ explains. *Wū néng* is pronounced *wū* (identical below). *Tiān ní* has two pronunciations, *cuī* and *ní*—the natural division. "Is *this* different from *not-this*? Then there is no dispute." (From the ancient southern repository; the old text reads "also no dispute.") "If it is truly *so*, is *so* different from *not-so*? Then there is no dispute." (From the ancient southern repository; the old text omits the character *yǐ*.) The clamor of voices debating right and wrong is but transformation itself.

*Màn* is pronounced *wàn*. *Yǎn* is pronounced *yǐ zhàn*. The text states: "the manner of ceaseless flow." Sīmǎ explains: "the manner of boundlessness." *Wǎn* means to expand or to halt; to lack limit or end, to exhaust. Cuī writes *jìng* (boundary). To equalize by following—*wǎng liǎng*: Guō explains it as "the faint yin beyond the shadow." Xiàng says: "the shadow’s shadow."

The text means: unlike the *shé fù* or *tiáo yì*, which depend on external conditions, my solitary transformation arises from the natural—what does it depend upon?

To equalize through transformation—*hú dié* is pronounced *tú xié* (butterfly). *Jiá dié* is the same. *Xǔ xǔ* is pronounced *kuàng fǔ*; the text states: "the manner of attuning to one’s nature."

To attain the principle of life—*páo dīng* is pronounced *bái jiāo*. *Páo* refers to the kitchen; *dīng* is his name. Chéng explains: "a servant in charge of the kitchen."

The minister engages with the spirit—*xiàng* here means to meet in darkness and align with the principle, hence "spiritual encounter." Not with the eyes does he see, but through the Dao’s lingering illumination. The senses halt at their posts—this is the method. The method lies in knowing when to stop, yet the principle cannot be paused, thus in a single morning he unravels the nine oxen. Yet the spirit desires to traverse the empty hollows, having forgotten itself.

*Pī* is pronounced *bèi jié* or *pū mí*—it means to strike. *Dà què* is pronounced *qù nì*—it refers to the spaces where joints intersect. *Dà kuǎn* is pronounced *kǔ guǎn*—it means hollow. *Kěn* is pronounced *kǔ děng*—it denotes where flesh adheres to bone.

To sheathe the blade is not to treat it roughly. *Yí xíng lěi fù*: Wén Xuān—Sīmǎ explains he was surnamed Gōngwén, named Xuān, a man of Sòng. *Yòushī* is an official title, a man of Sòng. *Wū hū* is pronounced *wū*.

"Jiè" is pronounced *jiè*. Cuī’s edition writes it as *wù*, or alternatively as *yuè*—amputation of the foot. Guō explains *jiè* as partial amputation.

He stood nine *chǐ* tall, with a stride of five *bǎ* and ten, fine brows and a square mouth, double pillars and three hollows, a sun on his forehead and a moon in his eyes—possessing the marks of a great sage. He dwelt on the south side of Mount Qí, where the Earl of the West summoned him to be Archivist. In the time of King Kāng, he served as the Historian Beneath the Pillar; in the time of King Zhāo, he crossed west through the Hánguān Pass, having lived in Zhōu for over two hundred years.

Stones were smelted into copper, which was green in hue and could sever grass and trees. All swords made from it were sharp, and the soil itself was refined and pure. On the mountain lived a beast the size of a hare, its fur golden, feeding on the cinnabar beneath the earth. It burrowed deep into the ground for its den and also consumed copper and iron. Its gallbladder and kidneys were like iron, and the female was white as silver. In the past, the armory of that kingdom had all its weapons and iron implements eaten away, yet the seals remained intact. The king ordered the armory’s den to be searched, and a pair of hares—one white, one yellow—were hunted. When killed and opened, their bellies contained iron gallbladders and kidneys. Only then was it known that the weapons’ iron had been devoured by the hares. The king summoned his swordsmiths and ordered them to forge the gallbladders and kidneys into swords. One male, one female: the male was named *Gàn Jiāng*, the female *Mò Yé*. These swords could cut jade and cleave rhinoceros hide; the king treasured them deeply.

*Beginning of the Fifth Scroll of the* Nan Hua Zhen Jing Zhang Ju Yin Yi
*Composed by Bi Xu Zi*

**Outer Chapters: "Pian Mu" Eight**
**Nurturing the True Nature and Life**

*Pián mǔ* – Pronounced *bù tián*. To pair; to join.

*Xuán yóu* – Pronounced *yóu*. The *Shuo Wen* says it means "a growth."
*Liè yú wǔ zàng* – Pronounced *cái làng*. The same below. The text says: "The liver corresponds to wood and benevolence; the lungs to metal and righteousness; the heart to fire and propriety; the kidneys to water and wisdom; the spleen to earth and trust."
All beings endowed with consciousness, all creatures born into life, possess the nature of benevolence and righteousness. Whether little or much, this is naturally determined. Though Yan [Hui] and Confucius differ by but a fraction, the latter can never be matched—how much less those who differ further still? Now, those whose nature is rich in benevolence and righteousness inevitably become self-important and lose their nature; those whose nature is deficient in them strive after them and forfeit their authenticity. Racing along the path of self-importance and striving, drifting amid the realm of right and wrong, they vie in boasting and emulation—can this be the true Way of virtue and power?
If people abide in their nature, the feelings of "much" and "little" become one; if things keep to their proper place, the principles of benevolence and righteousness naturally align. When each office is filled according to its capacity, the world will know no disorder.
*Yín pì* – Pronounced *pǐ yì*. The same below.
*Yú rén yì zhī xíng* – Pronounced *xià mèng*. Cui [Yun] says: "Though supernumerary toes and growths are not the true nature of the body, they arise from form and cannot be removed. Though the dispositions of the five viscera are not the true Way of virtue and power, they are arrayed in nature and cannot be governed."
Now, to establish the teachings of benevolence and righteousness in order to govern the dispositions of the five viscera is like cutting off supernumerary toes and growths. It injures the principle of nature and only exacerbates the affliction.
*Ér duō fāng yú cōng míng zhī yòng* – The old text reads: "Yet they multiply methods in the use of intelligence." Zhang Junfang removed the character *fāng*, making it resemble the phrase below, "excessive in intelligence."
To pair intelligence with supernumerary toes is to be deficient, for compared to the number of the five fingers, it is called "lacking." To pair intelligence is to be excessive, for it doubles other natures and is called "redundant."

Sima explains this as bending the neck against the yoke to charge forward. Another interpretation says *zhì màn* means to swerve aside. *Guǐ* (诡), pronounced *jiǔ bǐ*, refers to the bit in a horse’s mouth. *Guǐ xián* (诡衔) means to spit out the bit. *Qiè pèi* (窃辔) means to gnaw the reins.

*Tián Chéngzǐ* (田成子)—the *Records of the Grand Historian* says he was a minister of Qi, also known as Tian Chang. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Tian Chang assassinated Duke Jian and seized the lands from Anping east to Langye as his own fief. From Jing Zhong, who was enfeoffed in Qi, to King Wei, who became the lord of Qi, this spans twelve generations. *Hé cháng bù fǎ shèng zhì zāi* (曷尝不法圣智哉)—originally "Why did they not model themselves on the sages?" *Shàn rén bù dé shèng rén zhī dào bù lì, Zhí bù dé shèng rén zhī dào bù xíng* (善人不得圣人之道不立，跖不得圣人之道不行)—Good people cannot stand without the Way of the sage, and Zhi cannot act without the Way of the sage. Thus, the sage’s benefit to the world is slight. *Shèng rén shēng ér dà dào qǐ* (圣人生而大盗起)—When sages arise, great thieves appear. *Péi jī shèng rén, shèng rén yǐ sǐ, shèng rén bù sǐ, suī zhòng shèng rén shì nǎi shèng rén zhī guò yě* (培击圣人，圣人已死，圣人不死，虽重圣人是乃圣人之过也)—Strike down the sage, and once the sage is dead, even if sages multiply, this is the fault of the sages. Those sages are the sharpest tools of the world—from here upward, the eleven sages.

*Lóng Féng zhǎn* (龙逢斩)—beheaded by Jie. *Bǐ Gān pōu* (比干剖), pronounced *pǔ kǒu*—Bi Gan said, "As a minister, one cannot but remonstrate even unto death." He forcefully admonished Zhou, who flew into a rage: "I have heard the sage’s heart has seven apertures." He then split open Bi Gan to examine his heart. *Cháng* (苌), pronounced *zhí liáng*. *Hóng chǐ* (弘胣), pronounced *chì zhǐ*.

Chǐ means "to rend." Cháng Hóng was a worthy minister of King Ling of Zhou, a grandee of King Jing, and was killed by the people of Zhou in the sixth month of the third year of Duke Ai of Lu. It is also said that Liu Kang slandered him before the king, saying, "Cháng Hóng sent a letter to Shu Xiang, saying, 'Raise the Jin troops to attack Zhou, and Jin will kill the Liu clan.'" King Ling then had Cháng Hóng flayed and killed in Shu. It is also said that he was dismembered by a sword or that his intestines were ripped out—this is called *chǐ*.

Zǐxū, pronounced *mí róng chí*. He was torn apart and rotted in the river; the explanation is found in the "Great and Venerable Master" chapter.

Gù Zhí, pronounced *zhí shí*. Zhī’s hoard, pronounced *cáng cái làng*.

The wine of Lu was weak, and Hán Dān (pronounced *hán dān*), the capital of Zhao, was besieged. When King Xuan of Chu summoned the feudal lords to court, Duke Gong of Lu arrived late and offered thin wine. King Xuan was enraged and wished to humiliate him. Duke Gong refused to accept the reproach, saying, "I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, elder among the feudal lords, and perform the rites and music of the Son of Heaven. My merit is recorded in the house of Zhou. Though I have already erred in presenting the wine, to now reproach me for its thinness is excessive." He then departed without taking leave. King Xuan, furious, dispatched troops with Qi to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu’s rescue. Since Chu was occupied with Lu, Liang was able to besiege Hán Dān. This shows how matters arise from one another—it is also a case of resonance.

King Xuan’s name was Xióng Liángfū, son of King Dao. Duke Gong’s name was Fèn, son of King Mu.

It is also said that at a gathering of the feudal lords, both Lu and Zhao presented wine to the King of Chu. The wine of Lu was thin, while that of Zhao was rich. The Chu official in charge of wine sought wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. The official, enraged, exchanged Zhao’s rich wine for Lu’s thin wine and presented it to the King of Chu, claiming that Zhao’s wine was weak. For this reason, Hán Dān was besieged.

Pǒu, pronounced *pǔ kǒu*. Strike, pronounced *gǔ lì*.

To shatter sagely wisdom is what "abolish sagely wisdom and discard cleverness" means. *Fàngshě* is pronounced *pǒu*.

What thieves and bandits covet are gold and treasures, hence "do not prize goods hard to obtain."

Once sagely wisdom is dead, great thieves do not arise—daily renewal in the clouds’ work is ever new. The new is life, the old is death, thus "the sage is already dead."

Riding the uprightness of Heaven and Earth, steering the ceaseless transformations of the ever-new, attaining reality while diminishing its name, returning to the true while forgetting its theft—then great thievery ceases.

If sagely wisdom does not die, great thievery does not end. As the saying goes, "the sage does not die," meaning one clings to the old without daily renewal, is bound by names without creating reality.

If great thievery does not cease, is this not fitting?

*Yōu yōu zhī bìng*: *Lüshi Chunqiu* cites this passage; Gao You’s commentary states *yōu* means "hidden." The *Book of Songs* says, "As if harboring hidden sorrow, my heart is not at ease"—meaning he had no leisure to attend to governing the world.

*Dèng*: pronounced *bǐn*. A place name.

The Di people—*Xiǎnyǔn*. He did not allow what nourishes to harm what is nourished. The land is what nourishes people; now, contending over it leads to killing—this is allowing the land to harm people. People are nourished by the land, thus he did not allow the land to harm them.

*Yīn zhàng*: pronounced *zhíliàng*. *Cè*: pronounced *chūgé*. Connected in sequence—*xiānglián* read as written, meaning to follow in unbroken succession. The old pronunciation is *lìzhǎn*; some write it as *tà*, both meaning to carry and transport goods.

Mount Qi: pronounced *qíyí*. The mountain lies northwest of Meiyang in Fufeng; to its south lies Zhou Plain, where the state’s name was first changed to Zhou.

He did not allow nourishment to injure the body—he did not permit profit to burden his form. Wang [Yi] states: "Wealth and honor provide nourishment, yet one must not allow ignorance of nourishment to injure the body; poverty and hardship bring no profit, yet one must not allow the pursuit of profit to burden the form."

**Detesting Calamity**

The *Lüshi Chunqiu* cites this passage; Gao You’s commentary states: "Earth" refers to tiles and pebbles; "refuse" refers to thistles and thorns. The earthen drum and thistle drumsticks are the music of the Lord of Qi. The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: "To pacify superiors and govern the people, nothing is better than ritual; to transform customs and alter habits, nothing is better than music." Thus, these can govern the world.

Be sure to examine the means by which one attains kingship—through the sagely person’s authenticity in maintaining the self. The remainder is for governing the state, thus every movement and action must be examined therein.

The "means by which one attains" refers to the direction in which virtue extends; the "means by which one acts" refers to how one treats others. If actions are taken here, examination is not necessary.

The Pearl of Marquis Sui: The state of Sui lay near the Han River, where genuine pearls were produced. The Marquis of Sui once saw a wounded snake and applied medicine to heal it. Later, the snake returned bearing a luminous pearl, a full inch in diameter, pure white, whose radiance illuminated a room at night—this was its repayment to the Marquis.

In adulthood, he once served as an officer under the Ji family, ensuring fair measurements. He also served as an officer in charge of livestock, which flourished under his care, and thus became Minister of Works. Later, he left Lu, was rebuffed in Qi, expelled from Song and Wei, and beset with hardship between Chen and Cai. Thereupon he returned to Lu, where he was once again treated well. Duke Ding appointed Confucius as governor of Zhongdu. Within a year, all the states followed his example. From Zhongdu, he became Minister of Works, then Minister of Justice, and then acted as regent. When the people of Qi heard of this, they grew fearful, saying: "If Confucius holds power, Lu will surely become hegemonic." Thereupon they selected female musicians and sent them to the Lord of Lu. The Lord of Lu accepted them and neglected state affairs. Confucius then departed and went to Wei—this was his second exile from Lu.

Erasing his traces in Wei—meaning to sever all ties. *The Records of the Grand Historian* states: Duke Ling of Wei was aged and negligent in governance, showing no regard for Confucius. Confucius sighed and said: "If someone were to employ me, in a single month I would set things in order, and in three years, I would achieve success." Yet in the end, he was not employed.

Felling the tree in Song—*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: When Confucius was in Song, he practiced rituals with his disciples beneath a great tree. Huan Tui, the Minister of War of Song, sought to kill Confucius. Confucius departed, and later Huan Kui, resenting the place where Confucius had sat, had the tree cut down.

During King Li of Zhou’s calamity, when the Son of Heaven’s line was severed, the feudal lords all requested that he be made emperor. Gong Bo refused and declined the royal throne. After fourteen years of great drought, when houses burned, divination was performed at Taiyang, and the oracle declared that King Li was the baleful influence. Then the Duke of Shao enthroned King Xuan. Gong Bo returned to his clan and roamed carefree, content at the summit of Gong Mountain. Gong is a mountain, now located west of Gong County in Henan.

**"To Smear My Body"**
Fearing that wealth and nobility would defile my person. Cheng [Xuanying] explains: "If I were to coexist with Zhou, I would fear the corruption of my conduct." Another says: In the *Yielding the Throne* chapter, many passages emphasize the value of life, yet Wù Guāng and two or three others cast themselves into the water—why? The answer: The rise of Zhuangzi’s writings lies in returning to the root; the means of returning to the root begins with relinquishing glory. Thus, the *Yielding the Throne* chapter establishes a lofty standard of defiance toward the world, its purport being to refuse submission in order to refine custom, not to indulge the self in preserving life. The occasional passages that value life are merely expressions of the intent to abandon glory. Deeply weary of the toils of worldly affairs, they saw them as corrupting. Those of a lesser resolve, though clad in coarse cloth and sipping porridge, merely preserved their bodies. Those who fully embodied the Way stood far above the vulgar, transcending worldly bonds. They would sooner cast themselves into limpid waters than bow to the burdens of the age.

This was recorded in the old collection of pronunciations; it is copied here for its meaning, though it may not be entirely apt.

**Miscellaneous Chapters: "Robber Zhi" (Sixteen: "Following Nature")**

Confucius and Liuxia Ji were friends. Liuxia Hui—surname Zhan, given name Huo, style Jiqin. Some say his style was Ziqin. He dwelt beneath the willows and extended virtue and kindness. Some say *Hui* was his posthumous title. Others say *Liuxia* was the name of his fief. According to the *Zuo Tradition*, Zhan Qin lived during the reign of Duke Xi of Lu, over eighty years before Confucius’ birth. If he lived until Zilu’s death, he would have been one hundred fifty or sixty years old—impossible to have been Confucius’ friend. Thus, this is a parable.

*Zhi* (跖): *shi* rhyme. Li Qi’s commentary to the *Book of Han* states that Zhi was a great robber of Qin. Master Huang says that Zhi was the younger brother of Ji, named Yong, a great robber. The people of Qin called robbers *zhi*, hence he was commonly known as Robber Zhi.

Confucius gradually guided Zilu with ritual, and later Zilu donned scholar’s robes, offered his allegiance, and became a disciple. Zilu served as a grandee of Wei. When he heard that Kuai Kui, steward of Kong Kui’s fief, had conspired with Kong Kui to stage a rebellion and install him as Duke Zhuang, Zilu, who was outside, rushed in to confront Kuai Kui. Kuai Kui and Kong Kui ascended a tower, and Zilu sought to burn it down. Kuai Kui, in fear, sent Shi Qi and Hu Yan to attack Zilu, striking and severing his cap’s tassel. Zilu said, “A gentleman dies with his cap intact,” and so tied his tassel before perishing. One version states his body was minced into pickled meat.
His end: *zi xu* rhyme.

His end: *zhu zhuang ju* rhyme. *Zhu* means pickled meat.

Expelled twice from Lu and his traces erased in Wei—already explained in the "Abdication and Kingship" chapter.

Destitute in Qi: The *Records of the Historian* states that when Confucius journeyed to Qi, he became a retainer in the household of Gao Zhaozhi, hoping to gain an audience with Duke Jing. He discoursed on music with the Grand Master of Qi, heard the *Shao* melody, and studied it for three months, forgetting the taste of meat. The people of Qi praised him. Later, Duke Jing received Confucius with reverence, treating him with a rank between the Ji and Meng clans. In Lu, there were three ministers: the Ji clan held the highest office, while the Meng clan, though of lower rank, wielded no power—meaning the Duke treated him between these two. When Qi’s grandees sought to harm Confucius, he learned of it. Duke Jing said, “I am old and cannot employ you.” Confucius then departed—this is what is meant by “destitute in Qi.”

Besieged in Chen and Cai—already explained in the "Abdication and Kingship" chapter.

Yao was not filial and did not cede the realm to Dan Zhu. Shun was not filial—some say he fled from his blind father; others, that he married without informing him. Yu was lamed by his labors in regulating the waters. Tang exiled his lord, banishing Jie to Mingtiao. King Wu attacked Zhou and slew him at Muye. King Wen was imprisoned in Youli. The *Records of the Historian* states that when Zhou minced the Nine Lords, Lord Chang of the West sighed in secret. Chong Houhu learned of it and reported it to Zhou. In the twentieth year of Zhou’s reign, he imprisoned Lord Chang in Youli. Youli was the name of a prison in Heyang, in Tangyin.

And *qiang* rhymes with *zhang*.

Bao Jiao: Han Ying states that Bao Jiao was a recluse of the Zhou era. His clothes were tattered, his skin exposed, and he carried a basket as he gathered vegetables. He encountered Zigong on the road, who asked, “Sir, how have you come to this?” Bao Jiao replied, “Those who abandon virtue and teaching in the world are many—why should I alone not reach this state? I have heard that one who acts without being known by the age commits reckless deeds, and one who strives without being known by superiors destroys integrity. To persist in reckless deeds and destroyed integrity, yet not desist, is to be deluded by profit.” Zigong said, “I have heard that one who does not belong to the age does not partake of its benefits, and one who defiles his lord does not tread his land. Now you defile your lord yet tread his land, do not belong to the age yet gather its vegetables—whose are these?” Bao Jiao said, “Alas! I have heard that the worthy advance with weight and retreat lightly, while the incorruptible are quick to shame and slow to death.” Thereupon, he cast aside his vegetables and stood erect, withering away by the Luo River. A gentleman hearing of this said, “How unyielding was that incorruptible man! A mountain too sharp will not rise high; waters too narrow will not run deep. One who acts singularly lacks profound virtue; one whose ambitions rival heaven and earth brings misfortune upon himself. Bao Jiao may be called inauspicious. His measure of depth and shallowness led him only to this.” Some say he stood embracing a tree and withered away.

His end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.

Shentu Di: Han Ying states that Shentu Di was a man of the Shang era. Finding the age unworthy, he resolved to cast himself into the river. Cui Jia heard of it and stopped him, saying, “I have heard that the sagely and benevolent, in their place between heaven and earth, are the parents of the people. Now, for the sake of wetting your feet, you would not save a drowning man—is this permissible?” Shentu Di said, “Not so. In ancient times, Jie slew Guan Longfeng, Zhou slew Prince Bigan, and the realm was lost. Wu slew Wu Zixu, Chen slew Xie Zhi, and their states were destroyed. Thus, the ruin of states and the destruction of families were not for lack of sagacity and wisdom, but because they were not heeded.” Thereupon, he strapped a stone to himself and sank into the river. A gentleman hearing of this said, “As for incorruptibility, benevolence, and wisdom—I have yet to see them.”

Jie Zitui: The *Records of the Historian* states that Jie Zitui was a man of Jin. When Duke Wen returned to his state and rewarded his followers, the reclusive Jie Zitui was not among them. He neither spoke of his deeds nor received any emolument. Zitui said, “Lord Xian had nine sons, and only the Duke remains. Hui and Huai had no kin, and all within and without abandoned them. Heaven did not wish to end Jin, so it must have a lord. Who but the Duke should preside over Jin’s sacrifices? Heaven opened the way for him—yet these men claim it as their own doing. Is this not deceit? To steal another’s wealth is called theft—how much worse to covet Heaven’s merit and claim it as one’s own strength? Below, they conceal their crimes; above, they reward their treachery. When superiors and inferiors deceive one another, it is difficult to dwell among them.” His mother said, “Why not seek reward as well? If you die, whom will you blame?” Zitui said, “To imitate their faults would be a greater crime. Moreover, I have spoken resentful words and will not eat their emoluments.” His mother said, “At least let them know—what then?” He replied, “Words are the ornament of the person. If I wish to hide, why adorn myself? To adorn oneself is to seek recognition.” His mother said, “Can you truly do this? Then I will hide with you, and we shall not be seen again until death.” Jie Zitui’s followers pitied him and hung a letter on the palace gate, which read: “The dragon seeks to ascend to heaven, and five serpents aid it. The dragon has risen into the clouds, and four of them have found their place. One serpent alone resents that it has no station.” Duke Wen went out, saw the letter, and said, “This is Jie Zitui.” He was then preoccupied with the royal house and had not considered his merit. He sent men to summon Zitui, but he had fled. Learning that he had entered the mountains of Mianshang, Duke Wen encircled the mountains and enfeoffed them as Jie Zitui’s fields, naming them Jieshan, to record his error and honor the virtuous. Another account states that Duke Wen entreated him, but he would not emerge. When the Duke could not find him, he resolved to burn the mountain to force him out. When the mountain was set ablaze, Zitui would not emerge and was burned to death.

His end: *shi* rhymes with *si*.

Wei Sheng: A man of Lu. Some write his name as Weisheng.

Dismembered dog: *zhe* rhymes with *ke*. To display a corpse is called *zhe*. The *Feng and Hui Records* of the *Records of the Historian* state that Duke De of Qin first instituted the summer sacrifice, dismembering dogs at the four gates of the capital to ward off pestilence.

The beggar’s *qi* may also be written as *zou*.

*Li-ming* appears in Zhang Junfang’s edition; the old text has *li*.

Zixu drowned in the river: The *Annals of Wu and Yue* state that when Zixu remonstrated, the King of Wu would not heed him. He stamped the ground and wept, saying: “Alas! How grievous—this silence shall be our undoing. Loyal ministers are silenced, while flatterers stand at the ruler’s side. Governance and instruction lie in ruins; sycophancy knows no bounds. Perverse doctrines and false words twist right into wrong. Loyalty is abandoned and attacked; thus Wu shall be destroyed. Its ancestral temples razed, its altars forsaken, its cities turned to ruins, its halls overgrown with brambles.” The King of Wu flew into a rage and bestowed upon him the *Shulou* sword, commanding him to take his own life. Zixu thereupon fell upon his sword and died. The King of Wu then took Zixu’s corpse, placed it in a *chiyi* vessel, and cast it into the river.

Bigan was disemboweled: The *Records of the Historian* state that King Zhou’s debauchery and disorder knew no end. Viscount Weizi remonstrated repeatedly, but the king would not listen, so he plotted with the Grand Tutor and Junior Tutor and departed. Bigan said: “As a minister, if one does not remonstrate even unto death, how can the common people be without blame?” He then spoke forthrightly to admonish King Zhou. Enraged, the king said: “I have heard that the heart of a sage has seven apertures—is this true?” Thereupon he slew Prince Bigan and cut open his chest to examine his heart.

Regicide: *shi* rhymes with *zhi*.
Cheng explains: Initially, when Confucius heard that Tian Chengzi had assassinated Duke Jian, he bathed and went to court, informing Duke Ai: "Chen Huan has murdered his lord; I request that you punish him." This was to humble and subordinate himself to the lowly. Later, he accepted Tian Chengzi’s gifts and received his tribute—this was a contradiction between words and deeds.

Perverse: *bei* as in *zhan*.
Also rebellious: *bo* as in *fu*. To oppose.

Emperor Yao executed his eldest son—Cui Yun states this refers to Yao’s execution of his eldest son, *Kao Jianming*.
Cheng explains: He did not grant the throne to Dan Zhu, calling this an execution in the name of righteousness.
*Lüshi Chunqiu* states: Yao had ten sons; Shun had nine sons.
Shun exiled his younger half-brother—*liu* means banishment.
*Mencius* says: Shun enfeoffed Xiang at Youbi, yet while he himself was Son of Heaven, his brother remained a commoner. Could this be called familial love?

King Ji was the rightful heir—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Gu Gong had an eldest son, Tai Bo, and a second son, Yu Zhong. Tai Jiang bore a youngest son, Ji Li, who married Tai Ren, both virtuous women. They gave birth to Chang, who bore signs of sageliness. Gu Gong said: "Our line is destined to flourish—surely it will be through Chang." The eldest sons, Tai Bo and Yu Zhong, knowing Gu Gong wished to establish Ji Li as heir to pass the throne to Chang, fled together to the Jing Man. After Gu Gong’s death, Ji Li ascended, becoming Gong Ji—thus was King Ji the rightful heir.

King Wu overthrew Zhou and enfeoffed his younger brother, the Duke of Zhou, at Qufu, calling it Lu; his brother Shu Xian at Guan; and his brother Shu Du at Cai. When King Wu died, the crown prince Song succeeded, becoming King Cheng. As King Cheng was young, the Duke of Zhou assumed regency and governed the state. Guan Shu and Cai Shu suspected the Duke of Zhou of rebellion. The Duke of Zhou, bearing King Cheng’s mandate, executed Guan Shu and exiled Cai Shu—thus was this the Duke of Zhou’s execution of his elder brother.

Confucian fabrications—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: When Confucius left Chen and passed through Pu, he encountered Gongshu Shi’s rebellion in Pu, and the people of Pu detained Confucius. Among his disciples was Gongliang Ru, who followed Confucius with five private chariots. Tall and virtuous, possessed of great strength, he said: "Formerly, I followed the Master and encountered danger at Kuang; now we face it again here. This is fate. Having twice suffered hardship with the Master, I would rather die fighting swiftly." The people of Pu, alarmed, said to Confucius: "If you do not proceed to Wei, we will release you and swear an oath." They sent Confucius out the eastern gate, and he then went to Wei. Zigong said: "Can one break an oath?" Confucius replied: "It was a coerced oath—spirits do not heed it. Moreover, you were merely feigning compliance for the sake of appearances." *Wei* is pronounced *yu wei*; below, "for profit" is the same.

*Jian* in some editions is written as *jian* (to reflect).
I once saw in Zhang Junfang’s edition the character *ri* (sun) written as *ren* (person), pronounced *shi*.
*Song* is read as written, or Xu pronounces it *yao*.
*Song* means to debate or expound.
Wu Zixu gouged out his eyes—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Wu Zixu remonstrated, but the King of Wu did not listen and bestowed upon him the *Shu Lou* sword to die. As he was about to die, he said: "Gouge out my eyes and place them on Wu’s eastern gate to witness Yue’s destruction of Wu."
The upright Gong—*Analects* states: There was an upright Gong whose father stole a sheep, and the son testified against him.
Wei Sheng (Baozi) was explained earlier.
Shen Sheng did not defend himself—*Records of the Grand Historian* states: Crown Prince Shen Sheng of Jin was slandered by Lady Li, who secretly had someone speak ill of him and placed poison in the sacrificial meat. Weeping, he said: "How could the crown prince bear such cruelty? To plot against his own father—how much more so others? Moreover, the lord is old, a man of twilight years. Could I not wait and yet seek to usurp him?" Hearing this, he fled to Xincheng. The enraged Duke Xian executed his tutor, Du Yuan Yi. Someone told the crown prince: "The one who prepared the poison was Lady Li. Why not defend yourself and clarify the truth?" The crown prince said: "Our lord is old; without Lady Li, he cannot rest or eat in peace. To argue would only anger him further." Another said: "You could flee to another state." The crown prince replied: "Bearing such an evil name and leaving—who would take me in? I will kill myself." Shen Sheng took his own life in Xincheng.
Confucius did not see his mother; Kuang Zhang did not see his father—The text states: Confucius traveled extensively on diplomatic missions but did not see his mother after her death. Kuang Zhang: The people of Qi remonstrated with his father, who drove him away, and he never saw his father again.
*Suo zhuan* is pronounced *zhuan*. To dwell in peace.

The text reads *Wu Zu* in one version as *Wu Zhi*. *Le yi* is pronounced *luò*; the same applies below.

Thus, when one upholds the correct Way without forgetfulness—forgetfulness may also be written as delusion—it means that ruler and minister need only follow the true path without wavering, and so they do not employ wealth and nobility. Those who deviate do so because their wisdom and strength are insufficient, and thus they do not resort to deception.

The recluses who cut themselves off from the world and surpass their age say: "The human heart is easily swayed. Yet if one is born alongside the worthy, one may already consider oneself above others—how much more so if one personally attains wealth and nobility?"

*Can* is pronounced *qī*; *dan* is pronounced *hé*; *zhi* is pronounced *kǒng*; *qiong* in *qiong mei* means "to exhaust"; *jiu* in *jiu shi* means "to complete." *Xia ren* is pronounced *xié*.

Desire is pronounced *wù*; contention is pronounced *zhēng*. Huang’s commentary states that this refers to Tang and Wu. According to the *Book of Shang*: "When Ge Bo failed to perform sacrifices, Tang first attacked him. Later, when he campaigned eastward, the Western Yi complained; when he campaigned southward, the Northern Di complained, all saying, 'Why does our lord come so late?' Was this not contention on all four fronts?" *Yao ming* is pronounced *yāo*.

Here follows the translation:

Thus, one who values their person over the wealth of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their person over the world may be entrusted with the world. These two phrases differ slightly from the currently transmitted *Dao De Jing*, yet align with Wang Bi’s version. It is suspected that during the Kaiyuan era’s collation of the classic, alterations were made based on another text. Here, the version from the *Qi Yuan* is taken as definitive.

To dwell like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon—this is the image of spirit. Without speech, reverence arises. The dragon’s manifestation is drawn from its transformative ascent. Profoundly silent, like still water. The thunder’s voice is heard throughout the world. *Cóng róng*: a state of ease. *Chuī*: pronounced *chǎng shuì*. *Lèi*: pronounced *liè wěi*. Guo [Xiang] says it resembles dust motes moving of their own accord.

The sage empties the heart-mind. *Cuī Qú*: ancient worthies. *Lǎo Dān*: pronounced *tǔ lán*. "Take care, sir, not to disturb the human heart." The *Lü Shi Chun Qiu* states: "That which gives life is Heaven; that which nurtures and completes is man. To nourish what Heaven has begotten without disturbing it—this is the role of the Son of Heaven." The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve Heaven’s wholeness as their purpose. Gao You’s commentary says: "*Yīng* means to offend; *gù* means affair."

*Pái*: pronounced *pí jiē*. *Nào*: pronounced *chāng lüè*. *Lián guì*: pronounced *jū wèi*, meaning "to injure" or "to benefit." *Zhuó*: pronounced *dīng jué*. *Xuán*: a state of lofty and distant vastness. *Fèn*: pronounced *fěn jiān*, meaning "to collapse." *Jiāo fèn*: the unbridled gallop of a proud steed—an unstoppable force. It also refers to defying ritual and law, like a horse running wild.

The Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disturb the human heart. In high antiquity, people dwelled in nests and caves, lacked fire for cooking grains, and suffered from many illnesses due to their diet. The Yellow Emperor then introduced robes and skirts, constructed houses, invented pestles and mortars, and promoted plowing and weeding, allowing the people to enjoy the comforts of clothing, food, and shelter—all through the sagely governance of the Yellow Emperor. People benefited from this and called it *ren* (benevolence). When Chiyou disrupted order and cruelly harmed the people, the Yellow Emperor punished and executed him—again, an act of sagely governance. People found this fitting and called it *yi* (righteousness). Yet benevolence and righteousness arise naturally, their origins long preceding this. Later generations, unaware of this, merely saw their traces and claimed that benevolence and righteousness began with the Yellow Emperor.

*Bā*: pronounced *pàn mò*, meaning "white flesh." *Jìng*: pronounced *xíng dìng*, meaning "shin." Without hair—this describes how Yao and Shun followed the Yellow Emperor’s traces, exhausting their hearts and bodies, their thighs emaciated without white flesh, their shins bare of fine hair. *Huān*: pronounced *huān*. *Dōu*: pronounced *dīng hóu*.

Huan Dou was the son of Emperor Hongshi, known as Hundun. He hailed from the southern foothills of Mount Chong. In the sixtieth year of his reign, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong. The San Miao were the descendants of Jinyunshi, known as Taotie. The Three Peaks (pronounced *wēi*) were mountains in the western frontier, now under Tianshui. In the sixty-sixth year of his reign, Yao exiled the San Miao to the Three Peaks. Gong Gong was the son of Shaohao, known as Qiongqi. He came from the northern frontier of Youdu in Youzhou. In the sixty-fourth year of his reign, Yao banished Gong Gong to Youdu.

One variant includes an additional twenty-four characters here: "The mutual arising of being and non-being is extreme. Zeng and Shi, Jie and Zhi—whether they possess being or non-being, how could they not collide with one another?"

*Qīng jìng mín zhèng* (清静民正): The Yellow Emperor has already explained this in the *Qi Wu* chapter. Guangchengzi was an ancient Daoist master. Kongtong is a mountain name, said to be where the Northern Dipper culminates; another account places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liangguo. The character *zhī* (之) in "of the mountain" follows Zhang Junfang’s edition, while older versions read *shàng* (上). *Zhì* (质): refers to coarse and shallow physical form. Clouds and qi do not wait to gather before raining—Sima states that *zú* (族) means "to assemble"; rain before gathering implies scant moisture. Plants and trees do not wait to yellow before falling—Sima states that *luò* (落) means "to die," indicating an excess of killing energy. *Jiǎn jiǎn* (翦翦): Sima states this describes a glib appearance; another says it means "flattering."

At one thousand two hundred years—Li Chunfeng states that heaven has no master and things grow thin—this span of one thousand two hundred years is called the "Ten Great Measures," the first being the minor reckoning of yin and yang. Four nines make thirty-six, totaling three hundred sixty; four eights make thirty-two, totaling three hundred twenty; four sevens make twenty-eight, totaling two hundred eighty; four sixes make twenty-four, totaling two hundred forty; together these sum to one thousand two hundred.

Inferior to the many arts: *Qǐ* (绮): pronounced *qǐ*. The multitude surpasses me in knowledge and skill; the many arts of others far exceed my own. How can one not become self-ensnared? *Cǐlǎn* (此揽): pronounced *lǎn*, same as *lǎn* (揽). This passage, "taking hold of another’s state," follows the Jiangnan ancient manuscript; the old text was incomplete.

Regarding the "sea crow"—Sima [Qian] notes in the *Guoyu*: it is called *àijū* (爱居). When it alighted outside the eastern gate of Lu for three days, Zang Wenzhong ordered the people to offer sacrifice to it—not to the Lord of Lu. Yet it was worshipped in the Lu temple, hence the text refers to the "Lord of Lu," and the *Ode* speaks of the *yuān jū* (爰居). Another name is *zá xiàn* (杂县). It stands eight *chi* tall, its form resembling the *fènghuáng* (凤皇), and its cry sounds like *yà* (讶).

When it obtains water, it becomes *jì* (继), pronounced *jì*. Sima [Qian]’s edition reads *jì* (继), explaining: though the myriad things bear signs, only with the qi of water and earth do they succeed one another in generation. The *Shuōwén* defines *jì* (继) as continuation. Another saying: the reversal of *là* (腊) is *jué* (绝). The present text reads *xùn* (), which is the reversal of *là* (腊).

At the juncture of water and earth, it becomes *lóng* (龙), pronounced *hù wā*.

*Pín* (蠙): pronounced *bù tián*.

*Zhī yī* (之衣): Sima [Qian] explains: the roots of things lie at the water-earth juncture, spreading through the water; when viewed from above, they are unseen, but when scooped, they may be obtained—like silk floss submerged in water. The people of Chu call it the *wā pín* (鼃蠙) garment.

Cheng [Xuanying] says: green moss spreads in the water like silk floss; commonly called the frog’s garment.

It grows on mounds, *líng tún* (陵屯), pronounced *tú mén*. A hill or mound.

Then it becomes *líng xì* (陵舄), pronounced *xī*. Sima [Qian] says: things form through water, yet land-borne life arises on mounds, transforming into plantain. Its name is changed to *líng xì*. Another name is *zé xì* (泽舄), altering with dryness and moisture. Yet none know its origin—things transform without fixed form. When humans die, some may turn into grasses or trees; the essence of grasses and trees may become human.

*Líng xì* that obtains *yù qī* (郁栖) becomes *wū zú* (乌足). Li [Yun] says: *yù qī* is manure and soil; when mound crows dwell in manure and soil, they transform into *wū zú* grass. Sima [Qian] says: *yù qī* is an insect’s name, *wū zú* a grass’s name, growing by water. When *yù qī* resides among mound crows, it transforms into *wū zú*.

The root of *wū zú* becomes *qí cáo* (蛴螬), pronounced *qí cáo*, an insect’s name. Its leaves become *hú dié* (胡蝶), pronounced *dié*. Sima [Qian] says: the butterfly. Grass transforms into insects, insects into grass—without beginning or end.

*Hú dié xū yě* (胡蝶胥也): *xū* means mutual arising. Things mutually generate one another.

Transforming into an insect born beneath the stove, Sima [Qian] says: it arises from warmth and *qi*. Its form resembles a cast-off skin, pronounced *tuō tā*. That is, shedding its skin. Sima [Qian] pronounces it *yuè*, saying: newly emerged, its skin is smooth and fine. Its name is *qú duō* (鸲掇), pronounced *qú duō*. *Qú duō* is an insect’s name.

*Qú rǎng* (鸲攘) after a thousand days becomes a crow; its name is *gān* (乾), pronounced *gān*. The foam of *yú gǔ gān* (余骨乾)—*yú gǔ*’s foam, pronounced *mò*—Li [Yun] says: the juice in its mouth—becomes the *sī mí* (斯弥) insect. *Sī mí* becomes *shí xī* (食酰), pronounced *xī*. Sima [Qian] says: the midge that swarms over bitter wine.

*Shí xī* arises from *yí lù* (颐辂), *yí lù* pronounced *yí lù*, an insect’s name. It arises from *huáng xuàn* (黄軦), pronounced *kuàng*, an insect’s name. *Huáng xuàn* arises from *jiǔ yóu* (九猷), pronounced *yóu*. Li [Yun] says: *jiǔ* means long-lasting; *yóu* is an insect’s name. *Jiǔ yóu* arises from *mào ruì* (瞀芮), pronounced *mào ruì*. Small insects, fond of flying in chaotic swarms. Also a grass’s name.

*Mào ruì* arises from *fǔ quán* (腐蠸), pronounced *fǔ quán*, an insect’s name. The *Ěryǎ* says: another name is *shǒu guā* (守瓜); also called the yellow beetle in melons. Another says: the firefly. Another says: the mole rat.

*Fǔ quán* arises from *yáng xī* (羊奚), *yáng xī* pronounced *bǐ zhì*. The two characters above in red ink follow Zhang Junfang’s edition; previously omitted. It arises from *bù shī* (不), pronounced *xī yǐn*. Long bamboo gives rise to *qīng níng* (青宁). Sima [Qian] says: *yáng xī* is a grass’s name, its root resembling turnip; when it joins with long bamboo, they form a being—all arising from unlike kinds. *Qīng níng* is an insect’s name.

*Qīng níng* gives rise to *chéng* (程). Jia [Kui] says: *chéng* is called *bào* (豹) in the Central States, *mò* (貊) by the Yue people—another name for the leopard. *Chéng* gives rise to the horse; the horse gives rise to humans. The *Shǐjì*’s *Chronological Tables* say: in the twenty-first year of Duke Xiao of Qin, a horse gave birth to a human—all transformations of a single *qi*, adapting without limit.

Seen in the Jiangnan Ancient Repository edition; the old edition has *qì*. *Lǐ* states: to strike. *Lǚ Làn* quotes *Zhuāngzǐ*: "Those who shoot with earthen pellets soar; those who shoot with hooked pellets contend; those who shoot with golden pellets perish. The pellets are the same, yet some perish—this is because they must have something externally valued. When something is externally valued, it leaks, for internally it is hollowed out." *Fúzǐ* states: "King Xia sent Yi to shoot at a target the size of a square *cùn* and a bullseye the size of a *cùn* in diameter; he never missed a shot. The king said, 'Well done! If you hit the target again, I shall reward you with ten thousand gold; if you miss, I shall strip you of ten cities.'

If it ascends but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; if it descends but does not ascend, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. Lǐ states: when *yáng* scatters, *yīn* congeals—hence anger; when *yīn* rises and *yáng* lies hidden—hence forgetfulness.

Bǎi Lǐ Xī fled Qín and went to Wǎn, where a border guard of Chǔ seized him. Hearing of Bǎi Lǐ Xī’s worthiness, Duke Mù wished to ransom him heavily, but feared the Chǔ people would not consent. He then dispatched an envoy to Chǔ, saying: "My dowry attendant Bǎi Lǐ Xī is there; I request to ransom him with five black ram skins." The Chǔ people thus permitted it. At that time, Bǎi Lǐ Xī was already over seventy. Duke Mù released him from captivity and consulted him on state affairs. Bǎi Lǐ Xī declined, saying: "I am a minister of a ruined state; how am I worthy of such inquiry?" Duke Mù replied: "The lord of Yú did not employ you, hence his downfall—this was not your fault." After three days of persistent questioning, Duke Mù was greatly pleased and entrusted him with governance, styling him the Five Ram Skins Grandee. Bǎi Lǐ Xī demurred, saying: "I am not the equal of my friend Jiǎn Shū. Truly, though the world does not know him, I once wandered destitute in Qí and begged for food from a chariot driver. Jiǎn Shū took me in, and I then wished to serve Lord Wú Zhī of Qí. Jiǎn Shū dissuaded me, and I thus escaped the calamity of Qí. I then went to Zhōu, where Prince Tuí of Zhōu favored cattle. I offered my skills in cattle-rearing to gain his favor. When Prince Tuí wished to employ me, Jiǎn Shū again dissuaded me, and I departed, thereby avoiding execution. Later, when serving the lord of Yú, Jiǎn Shū once more dissuaded me. I knew the lord of Yú would not heed me, yet I remained for private gain of rank and emolument. Twice I followed his counsel and escaped disaster. Thus I know his worth." Duke Mù then sent envoys with generous gifts to invite Jiǎn Shū, appointing him as senior grandee.

*Xǐ zhuó*—pronounced *wén jué*.

*Yù yù*—the *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: water pent up becomes foul, wood pent up becomes worm-eaten, grass pent up becomes withered.

*Jīn jīn*—the text states: unclean. Cheng states: still leaking.

Still there is malice—Li states: malicious thoughts not yet exhausted.

Xiang pronounces it *huò*, meaning abundance, or in general. *Ér zhuō*—pronounced *zé jué*. Cheng states: *zhuō* means to grasp. *Nèi jiàn*—pronounced *qí niǎn*, meaning difficulty. Xu writes *jiàn*, pronounced *qí yǎn*, meaning to close or shut. *Kě miù*—pronounced *mò hóu*.

Sima states: in Chu dialect, extreme weeping without sound is called *gā*, or a voice broken from strain. *Wò*—Li states: to clench the hand is called *wò*. *Bù nǐ*—pronounced *wǔ lǐ*.

When the cosmos is at peace, the heart is greatly serene. When one perceives others as things, one perceives things as such—Zhang Junfang’s edition notes this was formerly missing. *Bài*—pronounced *mài*. *Yǐ huá*—pronounced *gǔ*. The *Língtái* and *Língfǔ* both refer to the heart. The true ruler dwells within, called the *fǔ*; the true master roams above, called the *tái*. Not seeing one’s own sincerity when acting means failing to reflect inwardly and rushing outward. *Měi fā ér bù dàng*—pronounced *dī làng*. The *Er Ya* states: *měi* means "though," indicating that though there is movement, it does not strike true. *Quàn nèi*—pronounced *quàn*, meaning a contract. What is internal belongs to oneself; what is external belongs to others. The inner contract bears no name; the outer contract is but merchant’s boasting. The *Shuowen* states: *quàn* means a contract. A contract is a written agreement split with a knife beside the text, hence called a contract. Guo Zhongshu’s *Pèishāng* notes: *quàn* with a slanted knife or slanted force refers to the labor contract’s *quàn*. Another meaning: to halt. *Kuí*—pronounced *juàn*.

Though delusion repeatedly arises is to lose delusory perception. Liu Deyi’s edition had a former lacuna here.

People see their *qǐ*—still pronounced *kuí rán kǔ huí*. *Kuírán*: an unmoving appearance. Another meaning: "secure," "master," signifying that the multitude, having seen their *qǐ* seeking what lies beyond, yet remain self-assured—how deeply shameful.

Things proceed in *qiě qiě* fashion—*gǒuqiě*, meaning careless. With hearts careless, they have no leisure to shelter themselves; how then could they shelter others?
How could they—pronounced *yān néng yú qián*.

*Mò cǎn*—pronounced *qī kǎn*. The *Guang Ya* states: "pain."
*Mòyé*—pronounced *mò yē*, name of a fine sword.

*Qí fēn*—pronounced *fú wèn*. Same below.

Thus, to depart and not return is for the true to drift away without homecoming. To see its ghost is for the yin *qi* to come and lodge.
To depart and obtain this is to obtain death; the lost are as one with the obtained, hence called "obtaining death."

To perish yet have substance—one of the ghosts. The *Guang Ya* states: *miè* means "to annihilate," "to exhaust." Though the light of heaven is extinguished, though there remains true nature, it is no different from those things of darkness.
The *Zhen’gao* calls them "pure numina," "ghosts of good clarity."

To exit without root, to enter without aperture—pronounced *kǔ diào*. Creation has no root; the great void has no aperture.

To have life—*yǎn*, pronounced *yú chéng*.
Sima states: *wū diàn*.
*Yǎn* means "blemish"; those with blemishes wish to cast them off.
*Cast off*—pronounced *pī*. To disperse.
Thus it is said: *yí shì* arises from the gathering of *yǎn*, and death comes from its dispersal.
*Là*—pronounced *lì hé*.
Refers to the *pí*—pronounced *pí*; Sima states: "the cow’s omasum."
*Hǎi*—pronounced *gǔ lái*. The big toe.

*Zhī lěi*—pronounced *liè wěi*.

Duke Mu of Qin *lóng*ed Bai Li Xi with sheepskin: Bai Li Xi fled Qin for Zhou, where a border guard from Chu captured him. Duke Mu ransomed him from Chu with five sheepskins. Another account says Bai Li Xi favored robes of five-colored skins, so the duke *lóng*ed him through what he loved. Already explained in the *Tián Zǐ Fāng* chapter.
*Wàng xíng tóng tiān*—to forget form and unite with Heaven.

"Jiè"—pronounced *jiè*; Guo states: "amputation."
*Guǎng Yǎ* states: "solitary."
*Chǐ huà*—pronounced *chì zhǐ*.
To split; implements for adorning appearance.
Now lacking feet, thus no longer cherished.
Another account says *chǐ* means "to separate."
Cui states: "*Chǐ huà*—unrestrained by rules and measures."
*Fū fù*—pronounced *fú*.
The text states *fù*—to warm repeatedly.
*Zhū*—pronounced *xí*; the text states: "to indulge."
*Bù kuì*—pronounced *kuì*.
*Guǎng Yǎ* states: "to bestow."
Yet one who forgets others in repeated warmth—this is what "to warm repeatedly" means.
That is, to indulge.
When a person indulges in habit, even in small matters they reach extremes. Now, one who warms and indulges another in what they have already obtained, yet does not return to weave and bestow it—this is the height of folly, failing to gain what others cherish.
Lacking the sentiment of mutual care, thus called "forgetting others."
*Wǔ*—pronounced *wǔ*.

Sunshu Ao held the *jué*-cup. According to the *Zuo Zhuan*, Sunshu Ao was the prime minister of King Zhuang of Chu. Confucius had not yet been born, and in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, Confucius passed away. Later, when the Duke of Bai caused chaos, Yi Liao had never served in Chu. The *Zuo Zhuan* of the twelfth year of Duke Xuan also records that Chu had Xiong Yi Liao, who was a contemporary of Sunshu Ao, far removed from Confucius—this is likely a figurative reference. Cheng [Xuanying] says the *jué* is also a wine vessel, holding one *sheng*.

In this context, the phrase "words of the ancients" refers to the invocations spoken by the ancients during gatherings and alliances, at the time of libation sacrifices. *Nòng wán*: *wán* means "pearl." *Nòng wán* refers to the skill of juggling pearls. Yi Liao regarded the affairs of the world as if turning pearls in his palm, finding amusement in this alone. The *Master of Ghost Valley* has a method for turning pearls, akin to the boundless ferocity of beasts. The infinite wisdom of the sage is like the ceaseless turning of pearls, resembling the inexhaustible might of beasts—thus Yi Liao demonstrated his skill in juggling pearls.

*Liǎng jiā zhī nàn*
Pronounced *nǎi dàn*. *Jiě* pronounced *xiè*. Sima [Biao] says Yi Liao was a brave warrior of Chu, skilled in juggling pearls. When Bai Gong Sheng of Chu was about to cause chaos, he killed the prime minister Zixi and Ziqi. They said, "In the south of the market, there is Xiong Yi Liao. If we obtain him, he can match five hundred men." They went to inform him, but he refused. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved, continuing to juggle pearls as before, saying, "I will not betray you." Bai Gong then killed Zixi. Ziqi sighed over the conflict between the two families, while Yi Liao remained uninvolved in their troubles.

The text says: Bai Gong Sheng and the grandee Zixi raised armies to fight each other. The two families’ grandees said, "Yi Liao is a reclusive scholar; one man is worth five hundred." They both sent envoys to summon him. Yi Liao lay at ease, resting his head high, receiving the envoys of the two grandees. He juggled pearls with both hands without pause, then lay back down without rising. When they pressed him with a sword, he remained unmoved. The envoys of the two grandees returned and fully explained Yi Liao’s intent. The two grandees said, "His high pillow and reclining show us his non-action; his unmoving response to the sword shows that military force is not to be relied upon. The two hands represent the two families; the pearls are round objects of non-action. Juggling them without cease means both will reach exhaustion. This makes clear that if the two families continue their conflict, they will surely perish." The two grandees disbanded their troops and returned, no longer resorting to arms.

*Gān qǐn bǐng yǔ*
*Qǐn* read as written; it means covering the face with a fan. Sima [Biao]’s edition reads *dèng*, glossed as *hé* (or *chì*, "wings"), the implement held by dancers in the *yú* sacrifice. Cui’s edition reads *yì* ("wings").

The people of Ying laid down their weapons. Sima [Biao] says this means Sunshu Ao wished to sleep peacefully and rest in tranquility, cultivating his virtue in the ancestral temple while repelling enemies a thousand *li* away. The state of Ying laid down its weapons, having no need for attack or conquest.

*Huì*
Pronounced *xū huì*. *Sān chǐ*: *chǐ* means "long." Sima [Biao] says *huì* means "breath." Yi Liao juggled pearls amid mounting difficulties; Sunshu Ao removed obstacles to repel enemies. I, too, wish to sigh over my *sān chǐ*. *Sān chǐ* refers to a dagger. Cheng [Xuanying] says *huì* means "mouth." If one’s words are fitting, then silence is no different from having a mouth three *chǐ* long. Thus, I wish for this.

*Bǐ zhī wèi*
*Bǐ* refers to Yi Liao and Sunshu Ao. One says *bǐ* refers to peaceful repose.

Though governing the present, one should follow the Way of the ancients. From ancient times to the present, one’s name is not erased.

*Wài xián*
*Xù xù*: Li [Yi] says it means the appearance of practicing benevolence. Wang [Bi] says it means the appearance of compassion, encouragement, and diligence. *Qí rén yǔ rén xiāng shí*: *yǔ* pronounced *yú*. It means they will rush toward benevolence and righteousness, no longer tending to agriculture, and when hungry, will consume one another.

*Suǒ wù*
Pronounced *wū lù*, referring to their conduct.

Moreover, let us suppose that the implements of the greedy among birds and beasts—Shi Ma says: the greedy among birds and beasts kill without limit; those greedy for benevolence and righteousness harm without end. Thus, let us suppose that benevolence and righteousness serve as the implements of the greedy among birds and beasts.

"In the case of ants, abandoning wisdom; in the case of fish, gaining strategy; in the case of sheep, abandoning intent": ants die in water, fish live in water, and sheep sicken in water. Another version says: the true person has no stench, thus does not attract ants—this is ants abandoning wisdom. To dwell together in the great Dao of mutual forgetfulness, possessing no virtue of clinging or delay—this is the fish’s strategy. Sheep, having no stench, do not attract ants—this is sheep abandoning intent.

*Self-concealment*
Waiting for others with the heavens; as seen in Zhang Junfang’s edition, formerly written as *zhī*.

When forms naturally burden one another, the world can burden things, and things can burden people—thus Minister Zhong could not avoid [his fate].

**Those who rely on the source and proceed**

**Shí-qí-yǒu-zhǐ**
When it comes to rest—what then?
Wang [Guo] states: *Anxious over wisdom* refers to those who act with intention, fretting that their bodily wisdom falls short. They do not know that employing wisdom must lead to loss, and having lost, they then worry over the lack of wisdom. As for their congratulatory deeds—flawed and unavailing—thus their roots of sorrow and trouble intertwine without a moment’s pause, hence *constantly lacks even brief respite*. When it comes to rest, unable to relinquish wisdom and abandon anxiety—what is there if not sorrow?

Wáng states: "One who forgets the self naturally has no counterpart in the world, and thus external things require no attention."

If one clings to something, it is unlikely to attain subtlety at any time.

Now, examining the constancy of external things, they refer to good and evil, loyalty and filial piety.

Self and things stand in opposition; the self is internal, things external. Because good and evil, loyalty and filial piety cannot preserve life in full, it is said: "In doing good, do not seek fame; in doing evil, do not incur punishment."

Wang says petty words are poisonous, yet no one speaks of it. *Who would be close and loving?*: Since no one speaks of it, this is the extreme of lacking closeness and love. *Fàn ruò* (泛若): pronounced *fāng jiàn* (芳剑切). *Zì fá* (自伐): to boast of oneself.

Gentle and unhurried—*Huǎn* (缓) is his name; a Confucian scholar of the state of Zheng, named Huan. At that time, the Confucian and Mohist schools were both flourishing, and Huan wished for his younger brother Di to study Mohism, hoping to receive the benefits of being a Mohist.

Another interpretation says *lù shēnyín* (露呻吟), meaning reading aloud. *Qiú shì zhī dì* (裘氏之地): a place name; Cui says *Qiú* refers to Confucian robes, hence the name. The *dì qí* (地祇) spent three years before Huan transformed into a Confucian—*qiào* (翹), pronounced *yí*. The *Shuōwén* says *dì qí* is that which brings forth the myriad things, meaning that after a thousand days of study, his Confucian learning was complete.

Some write it as *yín* (垠), pronounced *làng*. *Zhǒng* (冢) means grave. *Hé cháng shì qí liáng* (阖尝视其良): In the ancient southern Jiāngnán edition, the old text reads *Hé hú cháng shì qí liáng* (阖胡尝视其良).

*Xiāng zuó* (相捽), pronounced *cái gǔ*. It speaks of the man who digs a well, claiming the merit of creating the spring for himself, while those who drink from it do not know the spring’s natural origin. This is a metaphor for Huan not recognizing Di’s innate Mohist nature and resenting him.

Alas! The old pronunciation of *fū* is *hàowàn*. Guo Xiang’s commentary, in discussing its fundamental principles, may truly be said to have grasped the essence of Zhuangzi’s thought.

Guo, in his lifetime, lamented the sophistry of the wealthy and refined; I, too, have lately witnessed the vain discourse of the privileged and idle. This is what is meant by "different eras, same customs"—what more can be said?

Some ask: Zhuangzi and Huizi shared the bond of the Hao River’s bridge and modeled themselves after the master craftsman of Ying, yet why is it said that his works fill five carts while his words miss the mark? Could it be that their bond was like that of the craftsman of Ying, where even Xiang’s adze, when laid to rest, was met with criticism? Such words are truly excessive.

I reply: If one wishes to rescue the workshops of established teachings and illuminate their words with divine clarity, how can one fail to refine their expression and exhaust their analogies? Zhuangzi struck the resonant note of mystery across his seven chapters, arranging these writings for all generations. His profound words traverse the path of the arcane, and his endeavors unfold in the order of eloquent discourse. Though he discoursed on the primal and prized disputation, his teachings were never empty rhetoric. Yet his text is easy to peruse, while its deeper meaning is difficult to fathom. Those who approach it without full comprehension may harbor suspicions of overreaching its principles, and thus the flaws of such misapprehensions must be dispelled. This is why I have broadly addressed Huizi’s views on disputation.
