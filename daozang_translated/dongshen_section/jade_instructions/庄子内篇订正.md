**Free and Easy Wandering**

In the northern darkness there is a fish, and its name is *Kun*.
The greatness of *Kun*—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?
It transforms into a bird, and its name is *Peng*.
The back of *Peng*—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?
When it rises in fury and takes flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky.
This bird, when the seas shift, will journey to the southern darkness.
The southern darkness is the Celestial Pond.

The *Qi Xie* is a record of marvels.
Its words say: When *Peng* journeys to the southern darkness,
it strikes the water for three thousand *li*,
beats against the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand *li*,
and departs on the six-month breath.

The wild horses, the dust motes—all living things blow upon one another with their breaths.
Is the deep blue of heaven its true color?
Or is it so distant that it has no limit?
When *Peng* looks down, it is just like this.

Moreover, when water does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the hall, and a mustard seed becomes a boat for it; place the cup there, and it sticks fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel large. When wind does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only when the wind lies beneath at ninety thousand *li* can it then be borne aloft. Only when one rides the back of the azure sky without obstruction can one then set one’s course for the south.

The cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: “We burst forth and fly, darting between the elm and the sandalwood; sometimes we do not reach them and simply land on the ground. Why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?” One who travels to the nearby wilderness returns after a day’s provisions, with a belly still full. One who journeys a hundred *li* must grind grain the night before. One who travels a thousand *li* must gather three months’ provisions. What do these two creatures know?

Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the alternation of dusk and dawn; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived things. South of the land of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years make a spring, and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the *Dazhuang* tree, for which eight thousand years made a spring, and eight thousand years an autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—how sad that the multitude compares itself to him!

Tang’s inquiry of Ji is thus: In the farthest northern reaches, beyond the lands of sparse vegetation, there is a dark sea—the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, several thousand *li* in breadth, though none know its length; its name is *Kun*. There is a bird there, its name *Peng*, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It beats against the whirlwind, ascending ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and qi, bearing the azure sky, then setting its course for the south, bound for the southern darkness.

The minnow scoffs: “Where is it going? I leap and soar, rising no more than a few *ren* before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight! Where is it going?” This is the distinction between great and small.

Thus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue pleases one lord, or whose merit wins one state—when they regard themselves, it is just like this. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Moreover, though the whole world should praise him, he would not be encouraged; though the whole world should condemn him, he would not be disheartened. He has settled the division between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. In his relation to the world, he is not hasty.

Though this may be so, there remains that which has not yet been established. Liezi could ride the wind and travel, moving with chilling grace, yet after fifteen days he would return. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not hasty. Though he thus avoided walking, he still depended on something. As for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, who harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he depend upon? Therefore it is said: the Perfect One is without self, the Spirit Man is without achievement, the Sage is without fame.

**Chapter One**
When Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: “The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet still you irrigate—is it not laborious for its moisture to suffice? You stand and the world is ordered, yet I remain in your place—how lacking I feel in myself. I beg to yield the world to you.”
Xu You replied: “You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Yet I would still take your place—would I do so for fame? Fame is but the guest of reality. Would I become a guest?”

The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Return and rest, my lord. What use have I for the world? Though the cook neglects his kitchen, the priest would not step beyond the altar to take his place.

**Chapter Two**
Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: “I heard words from Jie Yu—grand yet without measure, sweeping yet never returning. I was startled and terrified by his speech, as if the Milky Way stretched endlessly, vast and distant, far from human sensibilities.”
Lian Shu said: “What did he say?”
Jian Wu replied: “On the distant Mount Guye dwells a spirit-man. His skin is like ice and snow, his bearing as graceful as a maiden. He eats no grain, but drinks the wind and sips the dew. He rides the clouds and qi, harnesses flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. His spirit is so concentrated that it keeps things free from blight, and the harvests ripen. Yet I find this wild and hard to believe.”
Lian Shu said: “Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the splendor of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. His words are like yours in this moment. That man, that power—he would unify the myriad things into one. The world clamors for order, but who would exhaust himself taking the world as his task? That man—nothing harms him. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, he does not drown; though drought melts metal and stone and scorches the mountains, he does not burn. From his dust and chaff, one could mold even a Yao or Shun—who would trouble himself with worldly affairs? The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought peace to the realm, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Guye north of the Fen River, he returned empty, having lost his grasp on the world.”

**Chapter Three**
Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: “The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its strength was not enough to lift itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was so vast it had no place to fit. Was it not hollow and large? Yet I deemed it useless and smashed it.”
Zhuangzi said: “You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the formula. The family gathered and deliberated: ‘For generations, we have washed silk and earned no more than a few coins. Now, in a single morning, we could sell this skill for a hundred gold pieces—let us give it to him.’ The traveler obtained it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead the troops. In winter, they fought on the water, and he utterly defeated Yue, winning lands and a fief. The same salve that prevented chapped hands—one man used it to gain a fief, while another remained washing silk. The difference lay in how it was used. Now, with your five-*dan* gourd, why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too large to hold anything—your mind is still as tangled as mugwort.”

**Chapter Four**
Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi: “I have a great tree, called a *rong*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, unfit for the carpenter’s line; its branches are twisted and bent, unfit for the compass and square. It stands by the road, yet no craftsman glances at it. Now, your words are grand but useless—just as the crowd rejects them.”
Zhuangzi said: “Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? It crouches low to lie in wait, then leaps east and west, heedless of high or low, only to be caught in a trap or snare. Now consider the yak—its size is like a cloud hanging from the sky. It is great indeed, yet it cannot catch a mouse. You have a great tree and worry it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothingness, the vast wilds, where you may wander carefree at its side, or lie at ease beneath its shade? No axe will fell it, and nothing will harm it. If it has no use, how can it come to grief?”

Nan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest and sat, gazing upward to exhale, his breath coming in gasps as though he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked: “What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who now leans on the armrest is not the same as the one who did so before.”

Ziqi said: “Yan, is it not well that you ask this? Today I have lost myself—do you understand? You have heard the *lai* of man but not the *lai* of earth; you have heard the *lai* of earth but not the *lai* of heaven.”

Ziyou said: “I venture to ask the method.”

Ziqi said: “The great clod breathes forth *qi*, and its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its ceaseless murmur? The towering peaks of mountains and forests, the hollows of great trees a hundred spans around—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some beams, some rings, some mortars, some pools, some puddles. Some rush forth, some wail, some scold, some inhale, some shriek, some howl, some moan, some bite. The first sings *yu*, and the followers sing *yu*. A gentle breeze elicits a faint harmony; a whirlwind, a great harmony. When the fierce gale subsides, all the hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen their trembling and quivering?”

Ziyou said: “The *lai* of earth is simply the harmony of the myriad hollows; the *lai* of man is the harmony of bamboo pipes. I venture to ask about the *lai* of heaven.”

Ziqi said: “The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own nature. All take of themselves—who then stirs them to anger?”

---

Great knowledge is broad and unhurried; petty knowledge is narrow and restless. Grand words blaze forth; petty words chatter on. In sleep, their spirits intertwine; awake, their forms stir. They engage in constant strife, battling daily with their hearts. Some are slow, some cunning, some secretive. Small fears leave them trembling; great fears leave them dazed. Their words fly forth like arrows from a crossbow, ever ready to judge right and wrong. They cling like those bound by oaths, ever guarding their victories. They wither like autumn and winter, their days dwindling away. They drown in their own doings, never to return. They grow weary like a sealed vessel, aging and stagnant. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, care and lament, fickleness and ease, exuberance and languor—like music from the void, like mushrooms born of steam. Day and night they replace one another before us, yet none know whence they sprout. Enough, enough! Morning and evening, this is how they come to be. Without that, there is no self; without the self, nothing is grasped. This is near indeed, yet we know not what moves it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It acts and is trusted, yet its form is unseen. It has reality but no form.”

**Right, Chapter One**

The hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—all are complete within me, yet with whom should I feel closest? Do you delight in all of them equally? Or do some hold a private claim? Are they all like servants and concubines? If so, are these servants and concubines incapable of governing one another? Do they take turns as lord and subject? Or is there a true lord residing within? Whether one seeks to know its nature or not, does it diminish or harm the truth?

Once receiving this completed form, it does not perish until its end. It grinds and wears against things, its course racing like a galloping steed, yet nothing can halt it—is this not sorrowful? A lifetime of toil without seeing success, wearily laboring without knowing where it leads—can this not be pitied? People call it "not dying," but what does it avail? The body transforms, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?

Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone in my confusion, or are there others who are not? If one follows the sincerity of the heart and takes it as teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must one possess knowledge of succession to have a heart that chooses for itself? Even fools share in this. To form judgments before the heart is fully formed—this is like setting out for Yue today and arriving yesterday. Thus, to assert that something *is* is to assert that something *is not*. To insist that something *is not* is still to assert that something *is*. Even if one were as spiritually attuned as Yu the Great, one could not know—what then can I do?

Words are not like the wind’s breath. Speakers have their say, yet what they speak remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do words differ from the chirping of fledglings, or is there a distinction? Or is there no distinction?

Where does the Dao conceal itself to produce truth and falsehood? Where do words conceal themselves to produce right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where do words remain that they become untenable? The Dao is obscured by partial attainment; words are obscured by florid ornament. Thus arise the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. To affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, nothing surpasses clarity.

Things are not inherently "that," nor are they inherently "this." From "that," one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: "That" emerges from "this," and "this" likewise depends on "that." This is the theory of the mutual arising of "that" and "this." Yet even as "this" arises, "that" dies; as "that" dies, "this" arises. Even as "this" is affirmed, "that" is denied; as "that" is denied, "this" is affirmed. Therefore, the sage does not proceed by such distinctions but illuminates all by the light of Heaven—this too is a reliance on "this."

"This" is also "that," and "that" is also "this." "That" has its own right and wrong, and "this" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a distinction between "that" and "this"? Or is there no distinction?

Does "that" and "this" truly exist? Or do they truly not exist? Where "that" and "this" find no counterpart, there lies the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot finds the center of the ring, it responds to the boundless. "This" too is boundless, and "not-this" too is boundless. Thus it is said: nothing surpasses clarity.

To illustrate the non-finger-ness of a finger by means of a finger is not as good as illustrating the non-finger-ness of a finger by means of a non-finger. To illustrate the non-horse-ness of a horse by means of a horse is not as good as illustrating the non-horse-ness of a horse by means of a non-horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.

What can be affirmed, affirm; what cannot be affirmed, enter into it—yet this is to invite collapse and ruin, disintegration and downfall. When the heart emerges in harmony, it becomes sound and name, omen and calamity. If he becomes an infant, join him in infancy; if he becomes boundless as a field, join him in boundlessness; if he becomes without limit, join him in limitlessness. Penetrate this, and enter into flawlessness.

Do you not know the mantis? Enraged, it thrusts its arms to block the chariot wheel, unaware of its incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious. To accumulate praise and beauty and then offend is perilous indeed.

Do you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of provoking their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of provoking their tearing rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding the heart of their anger. Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, tigers fawn upon those who feed them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill act in opposition.

Those who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and clamshells to collect their urine. Yet when flies and gnats alight upon them and they are struck untimely, the horse may bite through the bit, break its bridle, and smash its head and chest. Though the intention is care, the love brings loss—can one not be cautious?

In the third chapter, when Carpenter Shi reached Qi and arrived at Qu Yuan, he saw a community shrine tree. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk measured a hundred spans, and its height towered above the mountain by ten *ren* before branches appeared. A dozen or so of its side growths could be made into boats. Spectators gathered like a marketplace. The master carpenter did not glance at it but continued on his way without pause.

The disciple, eager to examine it, ran to catch up with Carpenter Shi and said: "Since I took up the axe and followed you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent as this. Yet you would not deign to look at it and walked on without pause—why?"

Carpenter Shi replied: "Enough! Say no more. It is but a worthless tree. If made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin or outer casket, it would rot swiftly; if made into vessels, they would break quickly; if used for doors or gates, it would ooze sap; if used for pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use whatsoever, and thus it has attained such longevity."

Upon returning home, Carpenter Shi dreamed that the tree of the community shrine appeared to him and said: "To what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'fine timber'? Consider the hawthorn, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees: when their fruits ripen, they are stripped and humiliated. Their great branches break, their small branches are torn—this is because their abilities bring suffering to their lives. Thus they do not fulfill their natural span but perish midway, self-destructing through their collision with the common world. All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time. Nearly dead, I have at last attained it—this is my great usefulness. Had I been of use, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how could you judge me thus? And you, a nearly dead worthless man, what could you know of a worthless tree?"

Carpenter Shi awoke and pondered his dream. His disciple then said:

"To seek usefulness through uselessness—then why serve as the sacred tree?"

"Hush. Say no more. It merely lodges there, enduring the scorn of those who know it not. Were it not the sacred tree, would it have grown so vast? Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common—yet you compare it by human standards. Is this not far off?"

**Chapter Four**

Nanbo Zicai wandered in Shangqiu and saw a great tree unlike any other. A thousand chariots could shelter beneath it, its canopy shading all within its rustling leaves.

Ziqi said: "What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary qualities."

Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters. Looking down at its massive roots, he saw they were split and useless for coffins or outer caskets. Licking its leaves, he found they blistered the mouth. Smelling them, he was struck with a madness that lasted three days without cease.

Zilai said: "This is truly a worthless tree—yet it has grown so vast! Ah! The spirit-like person takes this as worthlessness."

**Chapter Five**

In the state of Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those trees whose trunks were slender enough to encircle with one’s arms were felled by those seeking wood for monkey perches; those three or four spans in girth were felled by those seeking timber for grand and ornate halls; those seven or eight spans in girth were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking beams and pillars. Thus, none lived out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes. Such is the calamity of usefulness.

Now, the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, or the man with hemorrhoids—none may be offered to the river. The shamans and priests all know this, for these are deemed inauspicious. Yet to the spirit-like person, these are precisely what make for great auspiciousness.

There was one called Zhili Shu, whose chin nestled into his navel, whose shoulders towered above his crown, whose topknot pointed to the heavens, whose five organs were inverted above, whose thighs framed his ribs. Mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; sifting chaff and winnowing grain, he earned enough to feed ten. When the ruler conscripted soldiers, Zhili waved his arms among them; when the ruler launched great labor projects, Zhili, citing his chronic ailment, was exempted from service. When the ruler distributed grain to the infirm, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Ah! Though his body was broken, the Way moved through him and was fulfilled—things called it so, and so it was.

How does this come to be? It is so because it is so. How does this not come to be? It is not so because it is not so. Things inherently have their "so-ness," things inherently have their "rightness." There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not right. Thus, whether it be a bamboo mat or a pillar, a leper or Xi Shi, the perverse and the uncanny, the twisted and the monstrous—all are united in the Dao as one.

Their division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. Yet for all things, there is neither completion nor destruction, for they return to unity in the Dao. Only the enlightened understand this unity, and so they do not employ it but rest in the ordinary. The ordinary is function; function is penetration; penetration is attainment. Attaining this, one is near the mark.

Following this, ceasing to act while unaware of why it is so—this is the Dao. To exhaust one’s spirit in striving for unity while failing to recognize their sameness—this is called "morning three." What is "morning three"? It is said: A monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, "Three in the morning and four at dusk." The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, "Then four in the morning and three at dusk." The monkeys were all pleased. Yet the substance remained unchanged, and their joy and anger were put to use—this too follows the same principle.

Thus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong, resting in the balance of heaven, which is called "walking two paths." The ancients, in their knowledge, attained a certain limit. Where did they attain it?

One holds that things have never yet begun to exist—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. Next, one holds that things exist, yet boundaries have never yet arisen. Next, one holds that boundaries exist, yet right and wrong have never yet appeared. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. The diminishment of the Dao is the formation of partiality. Can there truly be formation and diminishment? Can there truly be neither formation nor diminishment? Where there is formation and diminishment, there is Master Zhao’s zither-playing. Where there is neither formation nor diminishment, there is Master Zhao’s not playing the zither. Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Music Master Kuang’s wielding of the baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the catalpa tree—these three men’s knowledge nearly reached its fullest, and so their deeds are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of it, they differed from others; because they were fond of it, they sought to illuminate it. What they sought to illuminate was not what could be illuminated, and so they ended in the obscurity of "hard and white." And their sons, in turn, spent their lives weaving the threads of their fathers’ arts, yet achieved nothing. Could this be called achievement? Even so, it is also achievement.

Could this, then, not be called achievement? Yet things and I have no achievement.

Thus, the dazzling confusion of the slippery doubt—this is what the sage contemplates. To act without employing it and lodge it in the commonplace: this is called "illuminating through obscurity."

Now, suppose there were a saying here—would it be of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, if they are taken together as a kind, then they differ in no way from that. Even so, let me try to speak of it.

There is a beginning; there is a time before that beginning; there is a time before the time before that beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is a time before that non-being; there is a time before the time before that non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly being or truly non-being.

Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking. Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu died prematurely. Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.

Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it "one," can there be no speech? The one and speech make two; two and the one make three. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoner cannot arrive at a number—how much less can the ordinary person? Thus, from non-being to being, we reach three—how much more so from being to being? Let there be no going toward anything; follow this and be done.

The Dao has never had boundaries, and speech has never had constancy. Yet because of this, there arises contention. Let me speak of this contention: there is left, there is right; there are hierarchies, there are principles; there are divisions, there are distinctions; there is competition, there is strife—these are called the eight virtues.

Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discourse; within the six directions, the sage discourses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the records of former kings’ aspirations—the sage debates but does not argue.

Thus, division implies what is undivided; distinction implies what is undistinguished. One asks: why? The sage holds it within, while the multitude debates it to display to one another. Therefore, it is said: distinction implies what is unseen.

The great Dao is not named; great disputation speaks not; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage does not harm. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when speech is disputatious, it does not reach; when benevolence is constant, it does not succeed; when integrity is pure, it is not trusted; when courage is harmful, it does not succeed. These five, when rounded, nearly approach squareness.

Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know—this is perfection. Who knows the disputation of no speech, the Dao of no Dao? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it and it is never full; draw from it and it never runs dry, yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light.

Therefore, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: "I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I sit facing south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?"

Shun replied: "Those three rulers remain among the brambles and weeds. How could you feel at ease? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and all things were illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun?"

**Chapter Two**
Nie Que asked Wang Ni: "Do you know what all things agree upon as right?"
Wang Ni said: "How would I know?"
"Do you know what you do not know?"
"How would I know?"
"Then do things have no knowledge?"
"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Now, let me ask you this: If people sleep in dampness, their waists ache and they become half-paralyzed—is that so for the loach? If they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—is that so for the monkey? Of these three, which knows the proper dwelling? People eat the flesh of livestock; deer eat grass; centipedes relish snakes; owls and crows feast on mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys mate with monkeys; deer consort with deer; loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji are considered beauties by men, yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when deer see them, they flee swiftly. Of these four, which knows the true beauty of the world? From my perspective, the distinctions of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I know their distinctions?"
Nie Que said: "If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfect Man also not know benefit and harm?"
Wang Ni said: "The Perfect Man is divine. Though great marshes burn, he is not hot; though rivers and lakes freeze, he is not cold; though thunder splits mountains and winds shake the sea, he is not startled. One like this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Life and death do not alter him—how much less the distinctions of benefit and harm?"

**Chapter Three**
Qu Quezi asked Changwuzi: "I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not seek joy, does not follow the Way; speaks as if silent, is silent as if speaking, and roams beyond the dust of the world. The Master dismissed this as reckless words, but I consider it the practice of the wondrous Way. What do you think?"
Changwuzi said: "These are words that even the Yellow Emperor found perplexing—how could Confucius understand them? Moreover, you are too hasty in your calculations, like seeing an egg and demanding a rooster at dawn, or seeing a slingshot and craving roast owl. Let me speak to you recklessly—why not listen recklessly? He roams alongside the sun and moon, embraces the cosmos, joins their union, and sets aside their confusion, treating all as equal. The multitude toil ceaselessly; the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into one pure whole. All things are thus, mutually enfolding one another. How do I know that delight in life is not delusion? How do I know that aversion to death is not like a youth who has lost his way and does not know his return? Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar; yet once she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former clinging to life? Those who dream of drinking wake to weep; those who dream of weeping wake to hunt. While dreaming, they do not know they dream; within the dream, they may even interpret it. Only after waking do they know it was a dream. And only after a great awakening do they know this was all a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, arrogantly claiming to know—lords, herdsmen, how rigid! Confucius and you are both dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called ‘uncanny paradoxes.’ Even if a great sage were to appear ten thousand generations hence to explain them, it would be like encountering him morning and night.

"Suppose you and I debate: if you defeat me, and I do not defeat you, does that mean you are truly right and I am truly wrong? If I defeat you, and you do not defeat me, am I truly right and you truly wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are we both right or both wrong? You and I cannot know, and others are likewise shrouded in darkness. Whom shall we ask to decide? If we ask someone who agrees with you, since they already agree, how can they decide? If we ask someone who agrees with me, since they already agree, how can they decide? If we ask someone who differs from both of us, since they differ, how can they decide? If we ask someone who agrees with both of us, since they agree, how can they decide? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know—must we wait for another?

"What is meant by harmonizing with the Heavenly Pivot? It is to say: ‘Is it so? Is it not so? If it is truly so, then its difference from not-so need not be debated. If it is truly so, then its difference from not-so need not be debated.’ The mutual dependence of affirmations and negations is like their non-dependence. Harmonize them with the Heavenly Pivot, follow them with boundless transformation, and thus live out your years. Forget years, forget righteousness, be stirred by the boundless, and so lodge in the boundless."

The Shadow of a Shadow asked the Shadow: "Earlier you were walking, now you are still. Earlier you were sitting, now you are standing. Why are you so without constancy?"
The Shadow said: "Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How do I know why it is so? How do I know why it is not so?"

Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly—fluttering and joyous, a true butterfly, delighting in the fulfillment of his intent, unaware of Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou. Yet he did not know: was it Zhou dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.

**Chapter Four: The Nurturing of Life**

Our lives are bounded, but knowledge is boundless. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous. Those who persist in such pursuit court peril alone.

In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing ill, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the Heavenly Pivot as your guiding principle, and you may preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.

Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot pressed, his knee braced—each movement released a crisp *hua* sound, each stroke of the blade a resonant *huo*. Every motion aligned with the rhythm, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin* and the cadence of *Jingshou*.

Lord Wenhui exclaimed: "Ah! How excellent! Has skill truly reached such heights?"

Cook Ding laid down his blade and replied: "Your servant’s devotion lies in the Dao, which transcends mere skill. When I first began to carve oxen, all I saw was the ox entire. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I follow the Heavenly Principle, cleaving great gaps, guiding through great hollows, proceeding along its inherent patterns. I have never touched a ligament or tendon, much less a major bone. A good cook changes his blade yearly, for he cuts; an ordinary cook changes his monthly, for he hacks. My blade has endured nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge remains as if newly whetted. For where the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness—when what has no thickness enters where there is space, how vast the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my blade remains as if newly whetted. Yet whenever I encounter a complex joint, I perceive the difficulty, grow wary, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and wield the knife with utmost care—until, with a sudden *die* sound, the ox falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. Then I stand, blade in hand, look around in satisfaction, wipe the blade clean, and put it away."

Lord Wenhui said: "Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life."

**Chapter One ends here.**

Gongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and was startled, asking: "What manner of man is this? Why is he one-legged? Was this given by Heaven, or by man?"
"It was Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus; man’s form merely reflects it. This is how we know it was Heaven, not man."
A marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may soar, it would not fare well.

**Chapter Two ends here.**

When Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him, crying three times before leaving. A disciple asked: "Was he not your master’s friend?" "Yes," he replied. "Then is such a brief mourning proper?" "Yes. At first, I thought him an ordinary man, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I found elders weeping for him as if for their own sons, and youths weeping as if for their own mothers. Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak without intending words, to weep without intending tears. This is fleeing from Heaven and betraying one’s nature, forgetting what one has received—what the ancients called ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ When he came, it was his time; when he departed, he followed the natural course. At peace with the time and in harmony with the course, sorrow could not enter. The ancients called this ‘the Great Release.’ A finger pointing at what is sought will wear out, but the flame is passed on—who knows when it will end?"

**Chapter Three ends here.**

**Human World**

Yan Hui sought an audience with Confucius, asking to depart. "Where to?" asked Confucius. "To Wei," he replied. "What will you do there?" "I have heard that the lord of Wei is young in years but firm in conduct. He rules his state lightly yet does not see his own faults; he treats the lives of his people as if they were nothing. The dead are measured by the land as if it were a marsh burned dry, and the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, Master: ‘Leave a well-governed state, go to a disordered one—where there are many illnesses, a physician’s gate is busy.’ I wish to ponder what I have heard and seek a principle, hoping perhaps to bring some relief to that state."

Confucius said: "Alas! You will likely go only to be punished. The Way does not tolerate杂乱;杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to anxiety, and anxiety to ruin. The perfected of old first established themselves before establishing others. If what is established in yourself is not secure, how can you attend to the conduct of a violent man? Moreover, do you know where virtue’s dissipation comes from, and from what knowledge arises? Virtue dissipates into fame, knowledge arises from contention. Fame is a tool for mutual conflict; knowledge is an instrument of strife. Both are ill-omened tools, not things to be fully enacted.

Furthermore, though your virtue may be deep and your trust solid, you have not yet grasped the people’s *qi*; though your fame may be known and free of contention, you have not yet reached their hearts. To forcefully present the language of benevolence and righteousness, the carpenter’s line and ink, before a violent man is to make him resent what he would otherwise admire—this is called ‘bringing calamity upon oneself.’ One who brings calamity will surely reap retaliation. Are you not likely to become a target for others?

Moreover, if you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, why seek to be different? If you remain silent, the lords and princes will surely exploit your presence to vie for advantage. Your eyes will be dazzled, your expression will grow placid, your words will become calculated, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will be molded by it. This is like quenching fire with fire, or flooding water with water—it is called ‘increasing the excess.’ Following such a beginning without end, if you persist in offering earnest words without trust, you will surely die before that violent man.

In the past, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves to serve the people below, yet their conduct clashed with their superiors. Thus, their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. They were lovers of fame. In ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xufang, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands of the dead, and they themselves were executed. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end—they were all seekers of fame and substance. Have you not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sage cannot overcome—how much less can you? Nevertheless, if you must have a way, come and tell me what you have in mind."

Yan Hui said: "If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded, will that suffice?" "No," said Confucius. "How could it?"

He who takes yang as his fullness, his brilliance overflowing, his colors ever-shifting—this is what the common man never resists. Following the impulses of others to seek harmony with their hearts, he is called one whose daily-accumulating virtue never ripens—how much less can great virtue? Clinging rigidly without transformation, outwardly conforming while inwardly unexamined—how could this ever suffice?

Yet if I am inwardly straight but outwardly bent, achieving while aligning above: To be inwardly straight is to follow Heaven as one’s companion. Following Heaven, one knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Would one then seek praise for one’s words, or hope others deem them good or bad? Such a one is called a childlike innocent—this is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion.

To be outwardly bent is to follow others as one’s companion. Kneeling with hands clasped, bowing in submission—these are the rites of a minister. If all men do this, how dare I not? Doing what others do, one incurs no blame—this is what it means to follow others as one’s companion.

To achieve while aligning above is to follow the ancients as one’s companion. Though one’s words may instruct, they are but borrowed truth; what the ancients possessed is not mine. Such a one, though forthright, is not faulted—this is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companion.

Would this suffice?
Confucius said: "No. How could it? Too many rules and laws, yet no penetration. Though firmly held, it remains blameless—but this is all. How can it reach transformation? It is still to follow one’s own mind."

Yan Hui said: "I have no further way forward. May I ask the method?"
Confucius said: "Fast. I will tell you. To act while possessing—is this easy? Those who find it easy are not favored by Highest Heaven."

Yan Hui said: "My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Might this be considered fasting?"

Confucius replied: "This is the fast of sacrificial rites, not the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui asked: "May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?"

Confucius said: "Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Hearing stops at the ears, the mind stops at signs. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao abides in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."

Yan Hui said: "Before I received your instruction, I was truly myself. Having received it, I am as though I have never been myself. May this be called emptiness?"

Confucius said: "You have attained it. Let me tell you: If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by fame, respond when it enters, and cease when it does not—without gate, without artifice, dwelling in a single abode and lodging in inevitability—then you are close indeed. To leave no trace is easy; to walk without touching the ground is difficult. To be employed by man is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. You have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. You have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Look upon that emptiness—an empty chamber generates brightness, and auspiciousness comes to rest there. If it does not come to rest, this is called sitting while galloping. If you follow the ears and eyes to communicate inwardly while the mind’s knowledge remains external, even spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so men! This is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Shun and Yu, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jie—how much more so those who are scattered and fragmented!"

Yan Hui said: "I have made progress."

Confucius asked: "What do you mean?"

Yan Hui replied: "I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness."

Confucius said: "Good, but not yet sufficient."

Another day, they met again.

Yan Hui said: "I have made further progress."

Confucius asked: "What do you mean?"

Yan Hui replied: "I have forgotten rites and music."

Confucius said: "Good, but not yet sufficient."

Another day, they met again.

Yan Hui said: "I have made progress."

Confucius asked: "What do you mean?"

Yan Hui replied: "I sit in forgetfulness."

Confucius started and said: "What is sitting in forgetfulness?"

Yan Hui said: "I cast off my limbs and body, dismiss my hearing and sight, leave my form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare. This is called sitting in forgetfulness."

Confucius said: "To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. And have you truly become worthy? I would follow after you."

Chapter One.

Lord Zigao of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying: "The king’s charge to me, Zhu Liang, is most weighty. The reception of envoys in Qi is likely to be respectful yet unhurried. Even a common man cannot be swayed lightly—how much less a feudal lord! I tremble at the thought. You once told me: ‘In all matters, great or small, few are not brought to completion through apprehension. If the matter fails, one must face the calamity of human judgment; if it succeeds, one must endure the affliction of yin and yang. Only those of virtue can ensure that, whether it succeeds or fails, no harm befalls them.’ I eat coarse food without complaint and tend the stove without craving coolness. Yet now, upon receiving my morning orders, I drink ice by evening—surely my inner heat is to blame. I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already suffer the affliction of yin and yang. If the matter fails, I must face the calamity of human judgment. These are two perils. As a minister, I am unworthy of such a task. Pray, instruct me further."

Confucius said: "Under heaven, there are two great precepts: the first is fate, the second is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place in heaven or earth where he may escape it. These are called the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, to find peace without choosing the place is the height of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, to find peace without choosing the task is the fullness of loyalty. In mastering one’s own heart, to return to joy and not alter it before one’s eyes, to know what cannot be helped and accept it as fate—this is the perfection of virtue. As a minister and son, one is fundamentally bound by what cannot be avoided. Proceeding with the truth of the matter and forgetting oneself—how could one have leisure to delight in life or fear death? You may go forth.

Let me also share what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be cultivated through intimacy; in distant relations, loyalty must be conveyed through words. Words must often be transmitted. Yet transmitting words that please or anger both sides is the most difficult task under heaven. Where both are pleased, there will be much exaggerated praise; where both are angered, there will be much exaggerated blame. All exaggeration is falsehood; falsehood erodes trust, and where trust is lacking, the transmitter incurs misfortune. Thus, the standard teaching says: Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit exaggerated words—then you will be nearly whole.

Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but often end in secrecy; when excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but often end in disorder; when excess prevails, there is much reckless revelry. All things are thus: they begin in sincerity but often end in vulgarity. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion is inevitably grand. Words are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily imperiled. Thus, anger arises without cause, and artful speech leans toward partiality. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their breath falters, and in that moment, a vicious heart arises. When scrutiny becomes excessive, an unworthy heart responds unknowingly. If one does not know why this is so, who can foresee the outcome? Thus, the standard teaching says: Do not alter orders, do not urge completion. Excessive change is harmful. Altering orders and urging completion endanger the matter. Success built over time endures; failure, once formed, cannot be amended—can one not be cautious?

Moreover, to ride the world’s currents and roam the heart, to entrust oneself to necessity and nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for contrivance or repayment? It is best to deliver the charge faithfully. This is the difficulty."

Yan He was about to instruct the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei when he questioned Qu Boyu, saying: "There is a man here whose virtue is as harsh as Heaven’s execution. If I deal with him without method, it endangers our state; if I deal with him with method, it endangers myself. His knowledge is just enough to perceive others’ faults but not to understand why they err. In such a case, what should I do?"

Qu Boyu replied: "An excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious, and rectify yourself. In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in heart, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet even these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission, nor harmony projection. If in form you submit, you risk collapse, destruction, ruin, or downfall. If in heart you project harmony, you risk becoming a voice, a reputation, an omen, or a scourge. If he acts like an infant, respond as an infant; if he abandons boundaries, abandon boundaries with him; if he knows no limits, match his boundlessness. Master this, and you enter flawlessness.

Do you not know the mantis? Enraged, it raises its arms to block a chariot wheel, unaware of its incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious. To accumulate praise and beauty while provoking him is perilously close.

Do you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed it living prey, lest its killing fury be aroused; nor whole prey, lest its tearing fury be provoked. They time its hunger and satiety, understanding its angry heart. Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, the tiger fawns on its keeper—this is compliance. Thus, those it kills are those who resist.

Those who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and conch shells for their urine. Yet when a mosquito or horsefly alights and they swat it untimely, the horse may bite through the bit, break its bridle, or smash its chest. Love may reach a point where it loses what it cherishes—can one not be cautious?"

In the third chapter, Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi and reached Qu Yuan, where he saw a community altar tree. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk measured a hundred spans, and its height towered ten *ren* above the mountain before branching. A dozen of its side growths could serve as boats. Onlookers thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not glance at it and continued on his way without pause.

The disciple, eager to examine it, ran to catch up with Carpenter Shi and said: "Since I took up the axe and followed you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent as this. Yet you would not deign to look at it, walking on without pause—why?"

"Enough," he replied. "Say no more. It is a useless tree. Were one to make a boat of it, it would sink; a coffin or outer coffin, it would rot swiftly; vessels, they would break at once; doors or windows, it would ooze sap; pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use—precisely why it has lived so long."

Carpenter Shi returned home, and in a dream the altar tree of Qu appeared to him, saying: "To what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'fine timber'? Look at the hawthorn, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees: when their fruit ripens, they are stripped and humiliated. Their great branches break, their small branches are torn—all because their usefulness makes their lives bitter. Thus they do not live out their natural span but perish halfway, struck down by the world’s demands. All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time. Nearly dead, I have only now attained it—this is my great usefulness. Had I been of use, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how could one thing judge another? And you, a nearly dead man of no consequence—what could you know of a useless tree?"

Carpenter Shi awoke and pondered his dream. His disciple asked:

"To seek the useless—then what is it to the sacred tree?
Silent.
As if speechless.
It merely lodges there, enduring the scorn of those who know it not.
Had it not been for the sacred tree, would it have nearly reached ten thousand?
Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude—yet to explain it by righteousness, is that not far off?

**Chapter Four**
Nanbo Zicai roamed the hills of Shang, where he saw a great tree unlike any other. A thousand chariots could shelter beneath its shade, and its rustling leaves seemed to sing. Ziqi said: "What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber."
Looking up at its slender branches, they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; gazing down at its massive roots, they were split and useless for coffins or outer caskets. Chewing its leaves, the mouth festered and bled; inhaling its scent, one fell into a frenzy, waking only after three days.
Zilai said: "Truly, this is a tree of no use—yet it has grown so vast! Ah! The spirit-like person takes this as non-utility."

**Chapter Five**

In the state of Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry flourished. Those trees whose trunks measured but a hand’s span were felled for monkey perches; those of three or four arm-spans, for the beams of grand mansions; those of seven or eight arm-spans, for the sideboards of wealthy merchants. Thus they never lived out their natural years but perished midway beneath the axe. Such is the calamity of usefulness.

Hence, an ox with a white forehead, a pig with an upturned snout, or a man with hemorrhoids—none may cross the river. The shamans and priests know this well, for they deem such things inauspicious. Yet to the spirit-like person, these are precisely what make for great auspiciousness.

**Chapter Six**

There was one named Zhili Shu, whose chin nestled in his navel, shoulders towered above his crown, topknot pointed to the sky, the five organs sat atop his frame, and his thighbones served as ribs. Mending needles and washing clothes earned him enough to feed himself; sifting chaff and winnowing grain sufficed to feed ten. When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili waved his arms among the ranks; when great labor was demanded, Zhili, citing his chronic ailment, was excused from service. Yet when the state distributed grain to the infirm, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. If one so deformed in body could still nourish himself and live out his natural years, how much more might one whose virtue is likewise deformed?

Confucius traveled to Chu, where the madman Jie Yu wandered past his gate, singing:
*"Phoenix! Phoenix!
How virtue has declined!
The future cannot be awaited,
The past cannot be retrieved.
When the world possesses the Way,
The sage achieves;
When the world lacks the Way,
The sage survives.
In this present age,
One barely escapes punishment.
Fortune lighter than a feather—
None know how to bear it;
Disaster heavier than the earth—
None know how to avoid it.
Enough! Enough!
Approach others with virtue.
Dangerous! Dangerous!
Marking the ground to follow.
Wandering, wandering—
Let nothing harm my path.
My path winds and bends—
Let nothing harm my feet."*

The mountain tree invites its own felling;
The lamp’s oil hastens its own burning.
Cinnamon is edible—thus it is cut down;
Lacquer is useful—thus it is slashed.
All know the usefulness of the useful,
Yet none know the usefulness of the useless.

**Virtue That Completes the Form**

In Lu there was a man without feet named Wang Tai. Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius.

Chang Ji asked Confucius, “Wang Tai is a man without feet, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discussing. The empty go to him, the full return. Is there truly a teaching without words, a formless shaping of the heart? What manner of man is he?”

Confucius said, “This man is a sage. I am merely one who lags behind and has yet to visit him. I would take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit it to Lu? I would lead all under heaven to follow him.”

Chang Ji said, “He is a man without feet, yet he surpasses you, Master. If so, how does he employ his heart so singularly?”

Confucius said, “Life and death are great indeed, yet they cannot alter him. Though heaven and earth collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things, guiding the transformations of beings while guarding their root.”

Chang Ji said, “What does this mean?”

Confucius said, “Viewed from their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from their sameness, the ten thousand things are all one. One who is thus does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the heart in the harmony of virtue. He sees what is one in things and does not lose it; he sees the loss of his foot as the shedding of earth.”

Chang Ji said, “He cultivates himself, using his knowledge to attain his heart, and his heart to attain the constant heart. Why do things flock to him most of all?”

Confucius said, “Men do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water—only stillness can still the many. Those who receive their mandate from earth, like the pine and cypress alone, remain verdant through winter and summer. Those who receive their mandate from heaven, like Shun alone, are upright. Fortunate is one who can make life upright and thereby make all lives upright. The proof of preserving the beginning is the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior strides into the nine armies. One who seeks fame and can bind himself is still thus—how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the ten thousand things, lodges in the six limbs, takes the ears and eyes as mere images, unifies the knowledge of knowledge, and whose heart has never died? He will choose a day to ascend on high, and men will follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?”

**Chapter One**

Shentu Jia, a man without feet, studied under Bo Hun Wu Ren alongside Zichan of Zheng.

Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay.” The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay. Now I am about to go out—can you stay? Or is this not so? Moreover, you see the one in power and do not avoid him. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?”

Shentu Jia said, “In the Master’s gate, is there truly one in power like this? Are you pleased with your own power and look down on others? I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; when it settles, it is no longer bright. To dwell long with the worthy is to be without fault. Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?”

Zichan said, “You are already thus, yet you still vie with Yao in goodness. By your virtue, are you not sufficient to reflect upon yourself?”

Shentu Jia said, “Those who justify their faults, claiming they should not have lost what they lost, are many. Those who do not justify their faults, claiming they should not have kept what they kept, are few. To know there is nothing to be done and to accept it as fate—only one with virtue can do this. I wander within Yi’s bow’s range. The center is the center of the target, yet to not hit the center is fate. Men bark at my incomplete feet as if I were whole, and I bristle with anger. But when I reach the Master’s place, I return composed. Do I not know the Master washes me with goodness? I have followed you, Master, for nineteen years and have never known I was a man without feet. Now you follow me within the form, yet seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?”

Zichan, startled, changed his expression and said, “You need not speak further.”

---

**Chapter Two**

In Lu there was a man without toes named Shushan Wuzhi. He came to see Confucius on his heels.

Confucius said, “You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?”

Wuzhi said, “I only did not know my duty and lightly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because what is worthy of my foot still remains, and I strive to preserve it. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be thus?”

Confucius said, “I am but a man of a hill—how crude! Why not enter and let me expound what I have heard?”

Wuzhi departed. Confucius said, “Disciples, exert yourselves! Wuzhi is a man without toes, yet he strives to learn to remedy his past misdeeds—how much more should one of complete virtue!”

Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, “Is Confucius not yet a perfected man? Why does he so assiduously take you as his teacher?”

He flaunts such bizarre and fantastical renown, yet does he not know that the perfected man sees these as his own shackles?

Lao Dan said, “Why not simply lead him to regard life and death as a single thread, the permissible and the impermissible as one continuum, and thus free him from his bonds? Would that be possible?”

Wuzhi replied, “Heaven has punished him—how could it be undone?”

**Chapter Three**

Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. When men dwell with him, they grow so attached they cannot bear to leave. When women see him, they plead with their parents, saying, ‘Better to be this man’s concubine than another’s wife’—and this has happened more than ten times. He never initiates speech, only ever harmonizing with others. He holds no lordly rank to deliver men from death, nor amasses wealth to fill their bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startles all under heaven, yet he harmonizes without leading, and his wisdom does not extend beyond his immediate sphere. Yet before him, male and female alike gather—there must be something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. When he dwelt with me, in less than a month I took interest in his character; before a year had passed, I trusted him completely. As the state had no steward, I offered him the governance. He responded with hesitation, as if reluctant, and when he did speak, it was as though he declined. I felt ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state. Before long, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had lost something, as though no one remained to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is he?”

Confucius said, “I once traveled to Chu and happened to see a young pig nursing from its dead mother. After a moment, the piglets shrank back in fear, all abandoning her and fleeing. They no longer saw her as their own, nor recognized her as one of their kind. What they had loved was their mother, not her form, but that which gave her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials are not adorned with military trappings; when a man’s feet are severed, no one cherishes his shoes. In both cases, the root is gone.”

The attendants of the Son of Heaven do not pare their nails nor pierce their ears; those who take wives remain outside the court and are no longer employed in service. If one whose form is whole may yet be deemed fit for display, how much more so the man of perfect virtue!

Now, Ai Taituo spoke not a word yet was trusted, had no merit yet was cherished, was offered a state yet feared only that he might refuse—this must be a man of complete talent whose virtue remains unmanifest.

Duke Ai said, “What is meant by *complete talent*?”
Confucius replied, “Life and death, survival and ruin, failure and success, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Therefore, they must not be allowed to disturb harmony or enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Let them flow smoothly without losing joy; let the days pass without discord, ever bringing spring to all things—this is to meet them with a heart that gives life to the seasons. This is what is called *complete talent*.”

“What is meant by *virtue unmanifest*?”
“Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It may serve as a model, for inwardly it preserves itself while outwardly it remains undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. When virtue is unmanifest, nothing can depart from it.”

Another day, Duke Ai told Minzi, “At first, I faced south as lord of the world, wielding the people’s guiding principles and fearing their deaths—I thought myself supremely enlightened. Now, having heard the words of a perfected man, I fear I lack true substance, that I have recklessly spent myself and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue.”

Chapter Four

The hunchbacked, limbless man without lips spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, and the duke was delighted with him, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed too slender. The man with a great goiter spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, and the duke was delighted with him, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed too slender. Thus, when virtue excels, form is forgotten. If men do not forget what ought to be forgotten but forget what ought not to be forgotten, this is called *true forgetting*.

Therefore, the sage wanders freely, and knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—why employ knowledge? He does not carve—why employ glue? He suffers no loss—why employ virtue? He does not trade—why employ commerce? These four are the fasting of the heavens. The fasting of the heavens is the sustenance of heaven. Having received sustenance from heaven, why employ man?

Chapter Five

One may have the form of a man yet lack the passions of a man. Having the form of a man, he mingles with others; lacking the passions of a man, right and wrong do not cling to him. Insignificant and small, he belongs to mankind; vast and great, he completes his heaven alone.

Huizi said to Zhuangzi, “Can a man truly be without passion?”
Zhuangzi replied, “Yes.”
Huizi said, “If a man has no passion, how can he be called a man?”
Zhuangzi said, “The Dao gives him his appearance, heaven gives him his form—how can he not be called a man?”
Huizi said, “If he is called a man, how can he be without passion?”
Zhuangzi said, “This is not what I mean by passion. What I call passion is when a man does not allow likes and dislikes to inwardly harm his person, but constantly follows nature without augmenting life.”
Huizi said, “If he does not augment life, how does he preserve his person?”
Zhuangzi said, “The Dao gives him his appearance, heaven gives him his form—he does not allow likes and dislikes to inwardly harm his person. Now, you exhaust your spirit outwardly, weary your essence, lean against a tree and chant, rest your head on a withered catalpa and doze. Heaven chose your form, yet you prattle on about ‘hard’ and ‘white.’”

Chapter Six: *The Great and Venerable Teacher*

Those who know what Heaven does and what man does have reached the utmost. To know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven; to know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without perishing midway—this is the fullness of knowledge.

Yet there is a peril. For knowledge must await something before it is fitting, and what it awaits is never certain. How can we know that what I call Heaven is not man? That what I call man is not Heaven? Only when there is a true man is there true knowledge.

What is a true man? The true men of old did not oppose the few, did not presume upon success, did not scheme. Such men, though they erred, felt no regret; though they succeeded, felt no self-satisfaction. Such men, when they climbed heights, did not tremble; when they entered water, did not get wet; when they entered fire, did not feel heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao in this way.

The true men of old slept without dreaming, woke without care; ate without relishing, breathed deeply. The true man breathes from his heels; the common man breathes from his throat. Those who are bent and submissive croak their words as if retching. The deeper one’s desires, the shallower one’s Heavenly mechanism.

The true men of old did not rejoice in life, did not hate death. They emerged without delight, entered without resistance—lightly they came, calmly they went. They did not forget their beginning, did not seek their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is what is meant by not using the mind to cast aside the Dao, not using man to aid Heaven. This is what is called the true man.

Such men had minds at ease, countenances serene, brows relaxed. Cold as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flowed with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet without limit. Thus, when the sage employs arms, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not do it out of love for men.

Therefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who relies on Heaven’s timing is not worthy; one who does not comprehend advantage and harm is no gentleman; one who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar; one who loses himself yet is not true is no servant of men. Men like Hu Buxie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of men’s service, followers of others’ paths, not seekers of their own fulfillment.

The true men of old had a bearing of righteousness yet were not partisan; seemed insufficient yet did not defer. They were substantial in form yet not rigid, expansive in emptiness yet not ostentatious. Cheerful as if pleased, solemn as if compelled. Their demeanor invited trust, their virtue brought stillness. Stern as if worldly, alert as if beyond control. Connected as if fond of leisure, joyful as if forgetting words.

They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, virtue as their guide. Taking punishment as their body, they were lenient in execution. Taking ritual as their wings, they moved through the world. Taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when compelled. Taking virtue as their guide, they spoke as if arriving at the hills with those who have feet—yet men truly believed them to be diligent in conduct.

Thus, their liking was one, their disliking was one; their oneness was one, their not-oneness was one. Their oneness joined them to Heaven as companions. Their not-oneness did not contend with man—this is what is called the true man.

When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.

The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, rests me with death. Thus, to make my life good is to make my death good. Life and death are fate, as constant as night and day—this is Heaven. What man cannot partake in is the nature of things.

He who takes Heaven as his father yet still loves his body—how much more should he love what transcends it? He who takes a lord as superior to himself yet still dies for his body—how much more should he die for what is true?

Hiding a boat in a ravine, hiding a mountain in a marsh—this seems secure. Yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware do not know. Hiding the small and large appropriately still leaves room for displacement. But to hide the world within the world is to find no place of delay—this is the great constancy of things.

Even one who cherishes his human form should rejoice in it. How much more should one rejoice in the myriad transformations of this form, which have no end? Can the joy of it be measured? Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot return yet all endure.

To be good at early death, good at old age, good at beginning, good at ending—men still emulate this. How much more should they emulate what binds the ten thousand things and awaits the one transformation?

The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-so—before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already firmly established. It spiritually animates ghosts and spirits, gives birth to Heaven and Earth. It is before the Supreme Polarity yet not high; below the Six Directions yet not deep. It preceded Heaven and Earth yet is not ancient; it is older than the oldest yet not aged.

Xiwei obtained it and thereby lifted Heaven and Earth. Fuxi obtained it and thereby embraced the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and has never faltered since ancient times. The sun and moon obtained it and have never ceased since ancient times. Kanpi obtained it and thereby embraced Kunlun. Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu obtained it and thereby dwelled on the great mountains. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens.

Zhuanxu obtained it and thereby dwelled in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang obtained it and stood at the Northern Culmen. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in the Lesser Expanse—none knew her beginning, none knew her end. Pengzu obtained it, reaching upward to the age of Yu and downward to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue obtained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, encompassing all under Heaven, riding the Eastern Rope and mounting the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to rank among the arrayed stars.

**Chapter One**
Nanbo Zikui asked of Nü’ou: “Your years are advanced, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this?”
He replied: “I have heard the Dao.”
Nanbo Zikui said: “Can the Dao be learned?”
He replied: “No. How could it be? You are not the right person. Now, Pulian Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I still guarded it and instructed him: after three days, he could put the world outside himself. Having put the world outside, I guarded it further, and after seven days, he could put things outside himself. Having put things outside, I guarded it further, and after nine days, he could put life outside himself. Having put life outside, he could then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing off, welcomes nothing, destroys nothing, completes nothing. Its name is *yingning* (serene disturbance). *Yingning*—it is that which is completed only after disturbance.”
Nanbo Zikui said: “From whom did you alone hear this?”
He replied: “I heard it from the son of Fu Mo. The son of Fu Mo heard it from the grandson of Luo Song. The grandson of Luo Song heard it from Zhan Ming. Zhan Ming heard it from Nie Xu. Nie Xu heard it from Xu Yi. Xu Yi heard it from Wu Ou. Wu Ou heard it from Xuan Ming. Xuan Ming heard it from Can Liao. Can Liao heard it from Yi Shi.”

**Chapter Two**
Zi Si, Zi Yu, Zi Li, and Zi Lai spoke among themselves: “Who can take nonbeing as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tail? Who knows that death and life, existence and nonexistence, are of one body? We would befriend him.”
The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in accord, and so became friends.

Soon after, Zi Yu fell ill. Zi Si went to inquire of him.
He said: “How wondrous! The Creator is about to make me thus crooked and bent.”

The crooked hump rose from his back, five tubes protruding above, his chin sinking to his navel, his shoulders towering above his crown, the growth at his nape pointing to the sky—his yin and yang qi disordered. Yet his heart remained unperturbed, and he strolled to the well to gaze at his reflection.

He said: “Alas! The Creator is about to make me thus crooked and bent.”

Zi Si said: “Do you resent it?”

He replied: “No, why should I resent it? If by degrees my left arm were transformed into a cock, I would use it to seek the dawn; if by degrees my right arm were transformed into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt an owl for roasting; if by degrees my buttocks were transformed into wheels, and my spirit into a horse, I would ride them—why ever change mounts?

Moreover, to gain is a matter of timing; to lose is a matter of compliance. Abiding in timely accord and dwelling in compliance, neither joy nor sorrow can enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release.’ Yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. Furthermore, things have never triumphed over Heaven for long—why should I resent it?”

Soon after, Zi Lai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around weeping. Zi Li went to inquire of him and shouted: “Away! Begone! Do not disturb his transformation.”

Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: “How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you?”

“Shall it make you into a rat’s liver? Or the arm of an insect?”

Zi Lai replied: “To a child, father and mother may bid east or west, and the child obeys without question. Yet the workings of yin and yang upon a person are no less than father and mother. If they draw near to my death and I refuse to heed them, I would be obstinate—what fault would lie with them? The Great Clod bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. Thus to treat my life well is to treat my death well.

Now, if a great smelter were casting metal, and the molten metal leapt up crying, ‘I must become a Moye sword!’ the smelter would surely deem it ill-omened metal. Likewise, if one who has assumed human form were to say, ‘I am human! I am human!’ the Creator would surely deem it an ill-omened person. Now, if we regard Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smelter, where could we go and not be acceptable?”

Then he fell into a deep sleep and awoke refreshed.

**Chapter Three**

Zi Sanghu, Meng Zifan, and Zi Qinzhang became friends and said to one another: “Who can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, roaming without bound, forgetting life and having no end?”

The three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in perfect accord. Thus they became friends.

After some time, Zi Sanghu died, his body yet unburied. When Confucius heard of this, he sent Zigong to assist with the funeral rites. One of the friends strummed a zither, another plucked a lute, and together they sang in harmony: *"Alas, Sanghu! Alas, Sanghu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain here, still clinging to human form."*

Zigong hurried forward and said, *"May I ask—is it proper to sing before the dead?"* The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, *"What does he know of the meaning of ritual?"*

Zigong returned and reported to Confucius: *"What manner of men are they? They cultivate conduct without regard for outward form, sing before the dead without change of countenance—there is no name for them. What manner of men are they?"*

Confucius said, *"They wander beyond the bounds of the world, while I wander within them. Beyond and within do not meet, and yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow of me! They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is but an excrescence, a hanging tumor; death is but the bursting of the tumor, the draining of the abscess. How could such men know where life and death, before and after, truly lie? Borrowing from different things, they lodge in the same body; forgetting liver and gall, they abandon ears and eyes. They cycle through beginnings and ends, unaware of origin or end. Vast and unbound, they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they trouble themselves with the rituals of the vulgar world, seeking only to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?"*

Zigong said, *"Then what path do you follow, Master?"*

Confucius replied, *"I am one whom Heaven has punished. Yet even so, I share this with you."*

Zigong asked, *"May I inquire as to the method?"*

Confucius said, *"Fish are made for water, as humans are made for the Dao. Those made for water dig ponds to sustain themselves; those made for the Dao find tranquility without effort. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, just as humans forget one another in the safeguarding of the Dao."*

Zigong said, *"May I ask about the *qi*-person?"*

Confucius replied, *"The *qi*-person is one who is odd among men but aligned with Heaven. Thus it is said: What is a petty man to Heaven is a noble man to men; what is a noble man to men is a petty man to Heaven."*

---

Yan Hui asked Confucius, *"Mengsun Cai’s mother died. He wept without tears, his heart untroubled, and showed no grief in mourning. Lacking these three, he was still praised throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning rites. How can one gain such a reputation without substance?"* Yan Hui found this strange.

Confucius said, *"Mengsun Cai has exhausted the limits of understanding—he has advanced beyond knowledge. He could not simplify further, for he had already simplified all he could. He does not know why he lives or why he dies, does not know what comes first or what follows. If he is transformed into another thing, he awaits the transformation he does not yet know. Even now, as he is about to change, how could he know he will not change? Even now, as he is not changing, how could he know he has not already changed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened. Moreover, he may be startled by his form but his heart remains unharmed; his dwelling may change, but his essence does not die. Mengsun Cai is simply awake—when others weep, he weeps, for that is his nature. And yet, we speak of ‘my’ ears and ‘my’ understanding—how can we be certain what we call ‘mine’ is truly ours? You may dream of becoming a bird and soaring to the heavens, or a fish and diving into the depths. But who can say whether the speaker now is awake or still dreaming? When one reaches perfect harmony, laughter does not follow; when one offers a jest, applause does not come. Accepting fate and departing from change, one enters the vast oneness of Heaven."*

Yi Zhi sought an audience with Xu You. Xu You said:

Yi Zhi sought an audience with Xu You. Xu You asked:
“Why did Yao endow you with such things?”

Yi Zhi replied: “Yao told me, ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’”

Xu You said: “Then why have you come to court? Since Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong, how will you wander the path of carefree ease, unconstrained freedom, and ceaseless transformation?”

Yi Zhi said: “Even so, I wish to wander within its bounds.”

Xu You said: “Not so. The blind cannot partake in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor can the deaf appreciate the spectacle of blue and yellow hues. How could they?”

Yi Zhi said: “Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—all within the forge and hammer’s reach. How can we be certain the Creator will not heal my brand and mend my mutilation, allowing me to attain completion and follow you, Master?”

Xu You said: “Alas, it cannot be known. Let me speak to you of the great outline: My Master! My Master! He orders the myriad things yet claims no righteousness, bestows blessings upon ten thousand generations yet claims no benevolence, predates high antiquity yet claims no age, encompasses heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms yet claims no skill. This is the realm in which one wanders.”

---Chapter Six---

Ziyu and Zisang were friends. When continuous rain fell for ten days, Ziyu said: “Zisang must be in dire straits.” Wrapping rice, he went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping—plucking the zither, Zisang cried: “Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!” His voice could not bear the strain, yet he hastened to recite his verse.

Ziyu entered and asked: “Why do you sing this poem in such a way?”

Zisang replied: “I pondered who brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers without partiality, earth bears without partiality—would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this, yet I cannot find him. And yet, to reach this extremity—it is fate, is it not?”

---Chapter Seven---

"Responding to Emperors"

Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Pu Yi Zi.

Pu Yi Zi said: “Only now do you understand? The Lord of Yu did not match the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed his benevolence to entice men—he gained men, yet never transcended the realm of the unenlightened. The Lord of Tai lay at ease, awoke unhurried. At times he took himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he never entered the realm of the unenlightened.”

---Chapter One---

Jian Wu met the madman Jie Yu.

Jie Yu asked: “What did Zhong Shi of Noon tell you?”
Jian Wu replied: “He instructed me that a ruler must issue laws, models, principles, and measures from his own person—who would dare disobey and fail to be transformed?”

Jie Yu said: “This is deceptive virtue. To govern the world thus is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He simply rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring his actions align with his true capacity. The cormorant flies high to evade the fowler’s snare, the field mouse burrows deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the digger’s harm—yet you deem these creatures lacking in knowledge?”

Chapter Three

Tian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered the Nameless Man and asked: “I beg to inquire how to govern the world.”

The Nameless Man said: “Begone! You are a vulgar man—why ask questions so ill-timed? I am about to become human with the Creator of Things. When weary, I ride the boundless bird beyond the six directions, roaming the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the vast wilds. How could your questions about governing the world disturb my heart?”

He asked again.

The Nameless Man said: “Let your mind wander in stillness, merge your qi with emptiness, follow things as they are without imposing private concerns—thus the world is governed.”

Chapter Four

Yang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said: “Suppose there is a man swift, strong, and resolute, with keen perception and clear understanding, who studies the Dao tirelessly. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”

Lao Dan replied: “To the sage, such a man is like a petty clerk bound by skills, exhausting his body and straining his mind. Moreover, the tiger and leopard’s patterned hides invite hunters, the monkey’s agility and the hound’s tracking prowess bring them to the leash. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”

Yang Ziju, startled, said: “May I ask how an enlightened king governs?”

Lao Dan said: “The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. He remains nameless, allowing things to rejoice of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and roams where there is nothing.”

Chapter Five

In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew men’s deaths and lives, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, predicting them by year, month, and day as if by spirit. The people of Zheng, upon seeing him, all fled in haste.

Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning home, he told Huzi: “I once thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.”

Huzi said: “I have shown you only its outward form, not its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? You present the Dao to the world in opposition, so you are seen through. Come with him tomorrow, and let me show myself to him.”

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Huzi. Before standing firmly, Ji Xian lost himself and fled.

Huzi said: “Pursue him.”

Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzi: “He has vanished, he is lost—I could not reach him.”

Huzi said: “Just now I showed him something not yet emerged from my source. I met him with emptiness and compliance, so he knew not who or what I was. He took me for drifting grass, for flowing waves—hence his flight.”

Thereafter, Liezi considered himself as one who had never begun to learn. For three years he did not go out, cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he would feed people, and took no special interest in affairs. He cast off carving and returned to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn block. Amidst confusion, he remained sealed off, thus ending his days.

---

Do not be a vessel for fame, do not be a repository for schemes, do not take on tasks as your responsibility, do not be a master of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace; exhaust what you receive from Heaven without showing attainment.

Liezi said to Huzi: “At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now there is something even greater.”

Huzi said: “I have shown you only its pattern, not its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? You oppose the world with the Dao, so you are seen through. Bring him again tomorrow, and let me show myself to him.”

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. It will not be ten days. I saw something strange—like damp ashes.”

Liezi entered and wept, his tears soaking his lapels, as he told Huzi.

Huzi said: “Just now I showed him the pattern of earth, sprouting yet neither stirring nor upright. He likely saw my blocked virtue’s mechanism. Bring him again tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to meet Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Fortunate that your master met me! He is restored—fully alive. I see his blocked power.”

Liezi entered and told Huzi.

Huzi said: “Just now I showed him Heaven and Earth, where names and realities do not enter, and the mechanism arises from the heels. He likely saw my virtuous mechanism. Bring him again tomorrow.”

The next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to meet Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Your master is unsettled—I can read nothing from him. Try to settle him, and I will observe him again.”

Liezi entered and told Huzi.

Huzi remained empty as before.

The perfected one’s use of the mind is like a mirror: it does not send forth nor welcome, responds yet does not store—thus it can master things without harm.

Chapter Six

The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying: “All men have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.
