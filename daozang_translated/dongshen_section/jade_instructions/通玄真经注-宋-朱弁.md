**The Origin of the Dao**

That which arises from mutual dependence has an origin; that which is mutually attested has a return. The Great Dao has no origin; the utmost principle has no return.

Yet when we trace it, the origin of the Dao lies within the realm of phenomena. But to restore the nature of things and trace their origin—how distant is this!

Laozi said:
*"Only after life does one grow white-haired; old age precedes the beginning of things."*

There is a thing, unformed yet complete,
The meaning of the Dao is this: its principle is rooted in spontaneity, its essence in emptiness and quiescence. Unlike phenomena, how can words be applied to it? Yet when we speak of "a thing," it is to clarify that which is beyond things. "Unformed" means it harmonizes the pure and turbid; "complete" means it omits not even the finest particle.

Born before Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth take darkness and yellow as their colors, square and round as their forms—how could the Dao arise after such shapes and hues? It is formless yet manifest, profound and obscure,
Apprehended by reason, not by sight.
Silent and desolate, it emits no sound;
It responds without echo, is heard without voice.

I forcefully name it the Dao.
When both form and sound are absent, names and words cannot reach it. If we wish to convey its meaning, what choice have we but to force a name? The sages’ reason for calling it the Dao is that its meaning encompasses all without exception.

The Dao is lofty beyond limit, deep beyond measure.
Gazing up, it grows ever higher; bending down, it grows ever deeper. Thus, that which has a limit is not truly lofty; that which can be measured is not truly deep. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, embracing the formless;
It encompasses the Two Modes, giving rise to the myriad things without leaving a trace.

Its source flows forth, empty yet never full.
Flowing from the profound, it does not sever its origin; abiding in emptiness, it does not overflow into things.

Though turbid, when stilled, it gradually clarifies.
To be one with things is called turbidity. Yet if we take its unstained essence and gradually harmonize it, its original clarity returns. "Gradually" means to contain principle with ease and composure.

Its application is inexhaustible.
It adapts to use like fire.

Unbound by dawn or dusk, enduring through ten thousand ages and a thousand autumns, from now unto all that follows.
Though its outward form fits within a single grasp, its true essence bears no trace of even the finest particle.

Contracted, yet able to expand—this lies in utmost simplicity; engage with it, and its reach becomes vast.
Obscure, yet able to illuminate—though shrouded in stillness and silence, it reveals the clarity of responsive brilliance.
Supple, yet able to harden—not contending with things is called suppleness; enduring without defeat is called hardness.

It contains yin and emits yang: concealing its function is yin, manifesting its transformation is yang.
Thus it reveals the three luminaries. Through the sun, moon, and stars it is observed, enabling each to shine in its proper place.
Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it; beasts run by it, birds fly by it; the unicorn swims by it, the phoenix soars by it; the celestial bodies course by it.
All abide in the Dao of spontaneity.

The fitting of height and depth, the momentum of flight and movement, the refinement of swimming and soaring, the patterns of warp and weft—these arise without anticipation, arrive without assembly, form their course without appointed overseers.
All things receive it and find their proper place, equally partaking in generation and completion. Thus is it called the Great Dao.

By non-being it grasps being: that which has form is ever subject to decay; yet through formless decay it establishes the existence of the empty body.
By lowliness it attains eminence: that which holds rank is ever subject to demotion; yet through rankless lowliness it achieves undemoted eminence.
By retreat it takes the lead: that which contends is ever subject to withdrawal; yet through non-contending retreat it secures invincible precedence.

Of old, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao, standing at the center.
The Three Sovereigns—Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Sovereigns—embodied the rulers who realized the Dao, perfect in pure harmony. Without governance, they transformed spontaneously; their virtue matched Heaven and Earth, guiding all things as one continuous thread. Thus were they able to lodge at the central pivot, applying its function while roaming freely without straying.

Spirit and transformation prevailed, pacifying the four directions.
Riding the principle of change and roaming through spirit, the people of the four directions each settled into their nature.
Thus, Heaven moves while Earth abides: the yang nature is firm and dynamic, the yin nature is yielding and inert.
Yet the wheel turns without ceasing, water flows without halt, accompanying things from beginning to end. Wind stirs, clouds condense, thunder roars, rain descends—all respond without end.

When virtue harmonizes with spontaneity and governance flows in perfect accord, Heaven and Earth suffer no loss; the principle of cyclical motion remains unobstructed. Wind and rain do not deviate; the rhythms of dryness and moisture are balanced. The five phases do not clash; the six qi naturally harmonize.
Thus the sage moves with the spirit of Heaven, abides with the stillness of Earth; his commands are like wind and thunder, his beneficence like clouds and rain. Though the myriad things generate and transform without limit, he holds to the One and practices non-action, advancing alongside them.

Carved and polished, they return to unhewn simplicity—restoring the nature of the ten thousand things.
Acting through non-action, it accords with the Dao: allowing things to act on their own, there is nothing it does not accomplish.
Thus things flourish in their nature while I remain ever inactive—thereby aligning with the Dao.

Speaking through non-action, it communicates through virtue: virtue is the function of the Dao; speech is the outward expression of humans.
Speech without intent penetrates things; things flourish in their proper order and preserve their peace. Thus, though one speaks all day, one never departs from virtue.

Serene and joyful, without self-importance, one attains harmony: through absence of self-importance, one merges with the Great Harmony.
Though the myriad things differ, each finds its ease in life: the ten thousand things vary, yet each suits its nature.
It harmonizes yin and yang—the Two Modes unite in harmony.
It regulates the four seasons—timing does not exceed its proper measure.
It balances the five phases—they do not encroach upon one another.

Its moisture nourishes grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone—its virtuous influence spreads widely, penetrating even the hardest substances.
Birds and beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; eggs do not spoil, animal fetuses do not miscarry—all fulfill the qi of generation and completion.
Fathers know no grief of lost sons, elder brothers no sorrow of weeping for younger brothers; no child is orphaned, no person dies young.
No woman is widowed.

When paired in proper kind, the rainbow and mirage vanish—such is the harmony of qi. Thieves and bandits do not arise, for none know the fleeting gains of ill-gotten profit. This is the fruition of embodying virtue. How perfect was the virtue of the Three Sovereigns! They ensured yin and yang never strayed, all beings followed their nature, and all befriended the Dao, becoming one with transformation—beyond naming.

Some say: In the distant antiquity of great antiquity, the primal wind remained pure and unadulterated. The people lived simply, their tools uncarved and unpolished. Thus the five phases did not clash, the four seasons each kept their office, qi was concentrated and naturally softened, and all lived out their full span. Was this not the result of sagely rulers and virtuous governance, where people were transformed by their influence—could it be that the Three Sovereigns’ lack of virtue brought this about?

Let us consider: The world is the body; the ruler is the heart. When the heart is disordered, the body falls ill; when the ruler is tranquil, the state is at peace. To achieve order and preserve life, merit finds its proper place.

Yet the Three Sovereigns arose in an age of pristine simplicity, a time entrusted to them, a path of self-governance. Had they not followed the Way of governance, forcing outcomes rather than letting things unfold naturally, temptations would have gradually arisen, and the natures of things would have been lost. The order of today is the subtle work of that primal achievement—its merit lies in non-action, its virtue unproclaimed. This is governance through non-governance, order that is not order.

The Way of Heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them; it transforms and completes yet does not dominate. Without intent, it gives life, and life arises of itself—thus it does not possess. Without intent, it transforms, and the myriad things complete themselves—thus it does not dominate. All things depend on it for life, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it for death, yet none can resent it. Where no love or aversion intervenes, how could merit or resentment find a place?

It gathers and stores without growing richer, distributes and bestows without increasing poverty. Winter’s yin consolidates, spring’s yang disperses, yet the qi of generation and destruction never wanes or overflows. Vague and indistinct, it defies representation—emerging from being and non-being, flowing through transformation, not to be grasped by any single form.

Elusive and fleeting, its function never exhausted—its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds to change without shape—its response leaves no trace. Penetrating and unobstructed, it never moves in vain—it acts only after being stirred. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, rises and falls with yin and yang, taking form in accord with all things.

Laozi said: The "great man" is so called for his self-attainment. Serene and free from thought, tranquil and free from care, nothing in the world can sway his essence. He takes heaven as his canopy, earth as his chariot, merging with the all-covering and all-bearing. The four seasons are his horses, yin and yang his charioteers—thus he rides them. He travels where there are no paths, yet all is vast and open. He roams without weariness, his spirit beyond exhaustion. He emerges where there are no gates, proceeding without fixed course.

Taking heaven as his canopy, there is nothing it does not cover; taking earth as his chariot, there is nothing it does not bear. The four seasons as his horses—there is nothing they do not drive. The work of generation and transformation ever operates thus. Yin and yang as his charioteers—there is nothing they do not prepare. The principle of growth and decline is thereby complete.

Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, his four limbs unmoving, his spirit roams without disturbance, his nature follows its course without fatigue. His clarity and insight remain undiminished, illuminating all under heaven—grasping the essence of the Dao, he observes the boundless realm.

Yet when desires arise, the myriad things surge in confusion, never attaining the mean. The six directions are open and all-pervading—knowing that form and nature meet, yet cannot be exhausted in one direction, only the spirit’s roaming can illuminate all under heaven. Grasping the essence of the Dao, is this not what is meant?

Proceeding without end, it is indeed fitting. Thus, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and extend it. Affairs are vast and cannot be compelled by force—only by following the natural tendency can one move in harmony with them. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be fathomed; one must hold fast to the essential and return to it. The changes of things are boundless and cannot be exhausted by wisdom—only by grasping the unchanging essence can one meet the root of transformation.

Therefore, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. Nature is the root; form and tendency are the branches. He hones his spirit, stills his knowledge and perceptions, clarifies and brightens his essence, and lets his nature flow freely. He does not indulge his heart in pleasing sights nor become entangled in external things.

Thus, he is indifferent and non-active, yet nothing is left undone. When nature is one with things, all fulfill their "doing." He does not govern, yet nothing is left ungoverned. Abandoning his own wisdom, he aligns with the self-governance of the myriad things.

What is called "non-action" does not precede the actions of things—since it does not precede them, it is clear that it is not inaction, but rather acting in accordance with them. What is called "non-governance" does not alter the natural—since it does not alter the natural, it is not the absence of governance, but rather governing in accordance with it. "Nothing is left ungoverned" follows from the mutual accord of things. When self and things are in harmony, this is the meaning of mutual accord.

Laozi said: He who grasps the Dao to govern the people responds to affairs as they arise and follows things as they move. He governs by following affairs and responds by following movement. The transformations of the myriad things—there is none to which he does not respond. The changes of the hundred affairs—there is none with which he does not coincide. Only with a mind free of intent can he fulfill them all.

Thus, the Dao is empty and nonexistent, level and easy, clear and still, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the form of the Dao. Its traces become form; its principle is the root of its body.

Emptiness and nonexistence are the dwelling of the Dao—unobstructed, it can gather all. Levelness and ease are the plainness of the Dao—following the Dao, it is without ornament. Clarity and stillness are the mirror of the Dao—bright and upright, it can illuminate. Softness and weakness are the function of the Dao—embodying compliance, it pervades all. Reversion is the constancy of the Dao—returning emotion to nature, it attains constancy. Softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is its strength—soft, it cannot be broken; weak, it cannot be overcome. Purity and unadorned simplicity are the trunk of the Dao—this is its essence.

Emptiness means nothing is carried within; levelness means the heart is unburdened. Not being laden with desires is the utmost emptiness; having no preferences or aversions is the utmost levelness. Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness—change pertains to movement. Unmixed with things is the utmost purity—mixture prevents it. Without sorrow or joy is the utmost virtue. The man of utmost virtue delights in heaven, thus he does not sorrow. Equalizing things, he has no joy.

The governance of the utmost man abandons his keen hearing and sharp sight—where there is sight he does not see, where there is hearing he does not hear. Merely exhausting the function of ears and eyes is not yet sufficient. Thus, opening and connecting the seven apertures does not limit their use to one movement. Never being enslaved, he attains the utmost in governing the body.

He eliminates ornamentation—how much less would he value external adornment beyond plainness and simplicity? He relies on the Dao and discards wisdom—resting in the open and level Dao, he abandons the wisdom of contrivance. He emerges with the people from the public—unlike them, he has no private interests. He simplifies what he holds—dwelling in essentials. He reduces what he seeks—indifferent to desires. He removes allurements and longings—he does not entice the people with cleverness nor admire the achievements of sages. He casts aside desires and discards thoughts.

Simplifying what he holds brings clarity—dwelling in essentials, he is discerning. Reducing what he seeks brings attainment—not seeking, he constantly attains. Thus, with the center controlling the external, the hundred affairs are not neglected—when the center attains it, the external can be shepherded. When spirit is whole and nature complete, he exhausts the principles of nurturing form and guiding things.

Attainment within the center brings peace to the five viscera, leveling thoughts—qi flows without disorder, nature remains unperturbed. Sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes keen. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—where is the Dao not present? How could it be distant from me? Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Deluded, they seek it outwardly; finding it within themselves, they return.

Laozi said: The sage forgets about governing others and focuses on governing himself. Governing others through governance is merely using affairs to resolve affairs, yet affairs never cease. It is better to cultivate one’s nature within to attain spontaneity, so that all under heaven will be so of themselves.

Each rectifies their nature and life-destiny—thus it is said: "I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves." Value lies not in power and rank, but in self-attainment; when the self is attained, all under heaven attains me. Once self-attainment is reached, there is nothing under heaven that is not attained. Allowing each to govern themselves, the myriad things attain what I have attained. Inner and outer merge in profound unity, and all under heaven fully attains—does this not exalt and illuminate the value of self-attainment above the value of power and rank?

Delight lies not in wealth and nobility, but in harmony. Wealth and nobility bring only care and toil—what joy can they offer? Only those who harmonize and attain themselves wander the path of constant joy.

To know the greatness of the self and make the world small—this is to approach the Dao. The greatness of the self lies in self-attainment; to make the world small is to forget about governing others—thus one draws near to the Dao.

Thus it is said: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness steadfastly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return." All things, teeming and abundant, return to their root in emptiness and stillness. Therefore, one whose nature is empty and penetrating may model the ultimate Dao of heaven; one whose body is tranquil and composed may align with the profound virtue of earth.

The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form. Though clay is molded into vessels, starting from something to reach completion, form and number are not without cause—thus the traces of beginning and end are clearly observable. Yet with the great smelting of the Dao, the furnace of yin and yang, the origin of creation is unseen, yet generation never ceases; the limit of its function is unfathomable, yet transformation never halts—thus the forms of beginning and end cannot be recovered.

Still and unmoving, it pervades all in profound obscurity—this obscurity is like yin and yang. Movement brings rest, but stillness knows no limit; only in its quiescence is it the master of generation and transformation. Vast and boundless, it cannot be deemed external; minute and infinitesimal, it cannot be deemed internal—neither great nor small can contain it within or without. It has no walled dwelling, nor can the six directions encompass it. Yet it gives rise to the general name of being and non-being. Though it leaves no trace of coming or going, it lodges the function of being and non-being.

The Perfected Person embodies it through emptiness, simplicity, clarity, purity, softness, weakness, and unadulterated plainness—unmixed with things. By embodying it, they possess these five virtues. The ultimate virtue is the Dao of all under heaven—thus they are called the Perfected Person. Humans are one of the three powers. When their nature attains pure harmony to unite with all under heaven, they are the Perfected Person.

The Perfected Person makes the self great and the world small, values governing the self and disdains governing others—this principle has been stated above. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to disorder their emotions—thus preserving their authenticity. They conceal their name and identity, not seeking to display their traces. When the Dao is present, they remain hidden; the highest virtue forgets virtue, thus it is not seen. When the Dao is absent, they appear—unable to forget virtue, they manifest themselves.

They practice non-action, engage in non-affairs, and externally shepherd all things. Those whose spirit is whole and emotions and nature are complete fully grasp the principles of nurturing form and guiding things. Attainment within the center brings peace to the five viscera, leveling thoughts—qi flows without disorder, nature remains unperturbed. Sinews and bones are strong, ears and eyes keen. The great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the self—where is the Dao not present? How could it be distant from me? Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Deluded, they seek it outwardly; finding it within themselves, they return.

Vast and boundless, it cannot be deemed external; minute and infinitesimal, it cannot be deemed internal—neither great nor small can contain it within or without. It has no walled dwelling, nor can the six directions encompass it. Yet it gives rise to the general name of being and non-being.

Though it leaves no trace of origin or destination, it lodges within the function of being and non-being. The Perfected Person embodies this—thus embracing emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, purity and clarity, softness and weakness, simplicity and unadorned plainness—never mingling with things. By virtue of this embodiment, they possess the five virtues of power.

The supreme virtue is the Way of all under heaven, hence they are called the Perfected Person. Humanity is one of the Three Powers. When one’s nature attains pure harmony to unite with all under heaven, this is the Perfected Person. The Perfected Person deems the self great and all under heaven small, values the governance of the self and disdains the governance of others—this principle has already been set forth above. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, for the sage forgets the governance of others and attends only to self-governance. They do not let desires disorder their emotions, thus preserving their authenticity.

They conceal their name and surname, not wishing to display their traces. When the Way is present, they remain hidden; the highest virtue forgets virtue, hence it is unseen. When the Way is absent, they appear, for they have not yet forgotten virtue and thus reveal themselves.

They act without action, engage in affairs without affairs. Laozi said: "Affairs arise in response to change and movement; when things change, I move, and only then do affairs arise. Change is born of the times, of the moment when generation reaches its limit. Those who know the times act without fixed conduct, for they respond to change."

Thus, the Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way, for the Way is named by its capacity to encompass the ten thousand things, hence it is not confined to one Way. The name that can be named is not the constant name, for names are named by their capacity to designate things, hence they are not confined to one name.

Writing arises from words, for writing records words. Words emerge from knowledge, for knowledge establishes words and records them in writing. Yet those who know do not know—this is not the constant Way. They merely constrain their knowledge to establish words, yet fail to respond to change, hence they are not constant in one Way. The name that can be named is not the repository of books, for books merely record the words of what is known; yet the names that designate things are not constant in one name, hence they cannot be contained in books.

Much learning leads to frequent exhaustion; it is better to guard the center. Those who cling to books of established words will repeatedly reach dead ends. Only by embracing and guarding harmony can one remain constantly unobstructed.

Abandoning learning brings no sorrow, for worldly learning teaches through classics and rituals, instructs with propriety and righteousness, aiming to adorn the exterior to distinguish the worthy from the foolish, and to lure them toward grand conduct—thus losing their nature. The sage establishes teachings to preserve nature, hence abandoning them brings no sorrow.

Rejecting sageliness and discarding wisdom benefits the people a hundredfold, for sageliness is the origin of legal systems, and wisdom the beginning of schemes and plans. Since they initiate traces that disorder things and harm the source of life and nature, abandoning them brings a hundredfold benefit.

Humans are born tranquil—this is the nature of heaven. The Way of heaven is tranquil, hence it generates; nature comes from heaven, hence it is tranquil. Movement follows stimulation—this harms one’s nature. When stimulated, one moves, and this harms the nature. Things arrive and one responds—this is the movement of knowledge. Things are of many kinds, and knowledge arises to distinguish them. When knowledge encounters things, likes and dislikes arise. As likes and dislikes take form, knowledge is drawn outward; knowledge, in distinguishing things, generates desires of attraction and aversion, while things, in stimulating knowledge, form appearances of beauty and ugliness. Once these take root within, one loses what is external.

Unable to return to the self, the principle of heaven is extinguished. This principle is one’s nature. Therefore, the sage does not exchange heaven for humanity, does not replace heavenly nature with human desire. Externally, they transform with things, yet internally, they do not lose their essence—essence being akin to nature. Thus, those who penetrate the Way return to purity and tranquility, while those who exhaustively pursue things ultimately attain non-action. Returning to nature, one communicates with the Way; through non-action, one can exhaustively comprehend things.

They nurture wisdom with serenity, for stillness is self-reflection. They contain spirit with indifference, for emptiness ensures the spirit’s correctness. They enter through no gate—this principle has already been set forth above.

Those who follow heaven wander with the Way, for yielding to nature, the spirit roams with transformation, never departing from the Way. Those who follow others associate with the vulgar, for conforming to human affairs and engaging with things through emotion is merely mingling with the common world.

Thus, the sage does not allow humanity to disturb heaven, does not let desires disorder emotions—this preserves their simplicity. They do not scheme yet are fitting, for without prior planning, they naturally align with affairs. They do not speak yet are trusted, for their responses never miss the mark, hence they are trusted without words. They do not deliberate yet attain, for an empty mind penetrates within, hence they achieve order without deliberation. They do not act yet accomplish, for abiding in uprightness and tranquility, they accomplish all without action.

Thus, when they dwell above, people do not feel burdened; when they stand before others, the multitude is not harmed. Covering all with the Way, the myriad kinds find peace—hence they are not burdensome. Guiding with virtue, all natures are harmonized—hence they are not harmed. All under heaven turn to them, and the devious fear them, for they turn to their virtue and fear their impartiality.

Since they do not contend with the ten thousand things, none dare contend with them. They subdue the ten thousand things with softness, overcoming with the Way—who can compare in virtue? Laozi said: "When people follow desires, they lose their nature, and their movements are never upright. In governing the self, this brings defilement, for desires in the self weary the body and stain conduct. In governing the state, this brings chaos, for desires in the state weary the people and disorder governance."

Thus, those who have not heard the Way have no means to return to their nature, for the Way reveals nature, and nature returns from desire. Those who are not attuned to things cannot attain purity and tranquility, for attaining principle brings understanding, and non-disturbance brings stillness.

Tracing human nature to its origin, it is without inner defilement, for it is received from heaven. Yet prolonged immersion in things leads to change, and change leads to forgetting the root, thus merging with that nature—"that" meaning the other. When one engages with things, desires arise.

The nature of water desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it; the nature of humans desires equilibrium, yet cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self, abandoning the objects of craving and desire to return to the pure and tranquil self.

Thus the sage does not allow the self to be enslaved by things. Abiding in the wondrous, how can things burden him? How could he accept servitude? He does not let desire disrupt harmony, so his joy is not exuberant—tranquil contentment brings no elation. His sorrow is not mournful—what lament is there in well-ordered governance?

Therefore, though exalted he is not imperiled, though secure he does not topple. Forgetting rank to share the people’s lot, he does not endanger his eminence. Forgetting rank to share their hardships, he does not overturn his stability. Thus, when good counsel and expedient plans are heard, even the foolish delight in them; when the sage’s virtue and lofty conduct are praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. Many delight in such words, yet few employ them; many admire such deeds, yet few practice them. The reason lies in being shackled by things and bound by custom.

In life, all desire to discern the myriad forms, to stand solitary and noble, to heed teachings of goodness, and to bask in the light of certain strategies. Even the coarse and ignorant—do they lack such aspirations? Yet daily they drift with things, long immersed in custom. Before righteousness prevails, how can it reach them?

Thus it is said: "Practice non-action, and the people transform themselves." Follow their actions and act accordingly, and though I do nothing, the people transform themselves. "I take no action, and the people enrich themselves"—without the disturbance of taxes and levies, the people naturally prosper. "I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves"—without contrived laws and teachings to lure them, the people attain the integrity of their nature. "I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity"—without the disruption of passions and cravings, the people preserve the uncarved purity of their nature.

Clarity and stillness are the perfection of power; the highest virtue is without virtue, ever clear and still. Gentleness and weakness are the function of the Way, for they can subdue the rigid and violent—this is the Way’s efficacy. Emptiness, tranquility, and contentment are the ancestors of the myriad things, for things arise from nothingness and are nurtured by harmony.

When these three are practiced, they merge into formlessness. Though named as three, in essence they are one; yet this one is not a singularity—it may be called formless. Formlessness is the designation of the one, for it lodges the formless within unity. The one, without fixation, harmonizes with all under heaven. Without fixation, it permeates form, yet cannot fully unite with the myriad kinds.

Virtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.

From formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge. Thus being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness. The body of the Way is emptiness, yet it gives birth to all forms, sounds, flavors, and colors—none exist without it.

The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are beyond hearing—when gong and zhi form patterns, the ear is confounded. The number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting—when sweet and sour harmonize, the palate is refreshed. The number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond viewing—when dark and yellow intermingle, the eye is dazzled.

When gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the sovereign of sound. When sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined—sweetness is the master of flavor. When white is established, the five colors are complete—white is the root of color. When the one is established, the myriad things are born—the one is the designation of nothingness.

The multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the one; the greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the one, one can encompass the root of the myriad names. Thus, when the one is established as the standard, the myriad things are born.

The principle of the one extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the one pervades heaven and earth. There is no distance it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is simple and thick like uncarved wood—complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid like muddied water—mingling with things and sharing their dust.

Though turbid, it gradually clarifies; though empty, it gradually fills. Vast and tranquil like great waters, drifting like floating clouds, it seems not to exist yet exists, seems to vanish yet remains. Its form is without substance, its traces gone yet its response present.

Laozi said: "The sum of the myriad things all passes through one aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from one gate"—none do not proceed from it. Thus the sage follows a single standard, unwavering in principle, unchanging in constancy. He follows the tracks of heaven’s Way, not altering his nature with the vicissitudes of affairs. He takes the plumb line as his model, the marking cord as his guide; the crooked conforms to the straight, the straight to the constant.

Since the nature of things is manifold, without abandoning the guiding principles of the Way, he can preserve their integrity in all its curvature. Joy and anger are the Way’s excesses—immoderation is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of power—failure to attain self-mastery. Fondness and aversion are the heart’s transgressions—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life.

Great anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. Virtue is ceaselessly bestowed—the one, clothing things to perfect power. Since things are inexhaustible, virtue knows no end. Its use is not toilsome, without labor or rest. It is seen yet unseen—no form is visible. It is heard yet unheard—no sound is audible.

From formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five notes resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five hues emerge. Thus being arises from non-being, substance from emptiness.

The essence of the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, yet from it arise all forms, substances, sounds, and colors. The numbers of tones do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes are inexhaustible to the ear; when gong and zhi combine into patterns, they confuse the ear. The numbers of flavors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tastes are inexhaustible to the palate; when sweet and sour harmonize, they delight the mouth. The numbers of colors do not exceed five, yet the variations of the five hues are inexhaustible to the eye; when dark and yellow intermingle, they dazzle the sight.

In sound, when gong is established, the five notes take shape—gong is the ruler of tones. In flavor, when sweet is established, the five tastes are determined—sweet is the master of flavors. In color, when white is established, the five colors are completed—white is the root of hues. In the Dao, when the One is established, the myriad things are born. The One is called "nothingness." The multitude or paucity of numbers all arise from the One. The greatness or smallness of things all originate from nothingness. Tracing back to nothingness, one may grasp the forms of all under heaven. Abiding in the One, one can encompass the root of all names. Thus, when the One is established as a term, the myriad things are born.

The principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the discernment of the One pervades heaven and earth. There is nowhere it does not reach, no height or depth it does not illuminate. In its wholeness, it is honest and simple as uncarved wood, complete and undecorated. In its dispersion, it is vast and turbid, mingling with things and sharing their dust. Though turbid, it gradually clears; though empty, it gradually fills—this meaning has been shown above. Vast as great waters, drifting like floating clouds, deep and boundless without shore, coming and going without attachment. As if absent yet present, as if perished yet existing—its form is without substance, its traces vanish yet its responses remain.

Laozi said: "The sum of the myriad things all passes through a single aperture—the Dao is the gateway of generation and transformation. The roots of all affairs emerge from a single gate—none do not proceed from it." Thus, the sage follows a single track, not altering what is constant, not changing what is eternal, adhering to the path of heaven’s course without losing constancy amid changing affairs. Setting standards by the plumb line, bending follows the straight, straightness follows the constant. As the natures of things are manifold, without abandoning the Dao’s guiding principles, one can preserve their natures through flexibility.

Joy and anger are the heart of the Dao—excess in them is not upright. Sorrow and grief are the loss of virtue—one cannot attain self-mastery. Likes and dislikes are the transgressions of the heart—errors of attachment. Cravings and desires are the burdens of life—excesses in nurturing life. Great anger shatters yin; great joy topples yang—yin governs solemnity and decay, yang governs harmony and delight. When these are expressed as joy and anger, they lack restraint. When the spirit is profoundly penetrating, it unites with the original true substance. The Dao is inherently possessed by humans, free from even the slightest desire—is this not the perfection of truth? Holding the mysterious virtue in the heart, transformation swiftly flows through the spirit. The transformation of non-action leaves no traces of virtue, hence it is called "mysterious." The true person has no mind, yet things follow—thus their transformation is not swift yet seems to rush.

Therefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is vast and boundless. The teaching that cannot be voiced spreads its transformation widely. Issuing commands and decrees to shift customs and mores depends solely on the conduct of the heart. The origin of commands lies in the transformation of virtue. Thus, when mysterious virtue clothes things, there is no need for teaching or decrees, yet customs naturally shift. From this, we know that the mysterious Dao resides in the heart without intention, yet acts.

The myriad things have their origins, yet only the root is known; all affairs have their sources, yet only the gate is guarded. Stillness can know the root of things; compliance can guard the source of affairs. Thus, one can exhaust the inexhaustible and reach the limitless—for only in clarity and emptiness can one exhaust and reach them. Illuminating things without dazzlement, responding to echoes without cessation—emptiness and stillness can reflect and respond.

Laozi said: "Those who attain the Dao have weak aspirations yet accomplish strong deeds—their wills, compliant and weak, achieve success through strength. Their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting—unburdened within, their responses are without error." The so-called ultimate weakness is gentle, soft, tranquil, and still. The Dao takes non-change as its aspiration, not the utmost of self-strength. Thus, it is as soft as down, clinging to the body without rising. Concealed in not daring, acting in inability—between action and concealment, there is non-action and no trace. Serene and inactive, movement does not miss its time—action lies in response, so what is lost?

Thus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation, the small embraces the great—all mean that dwelling in humble weakness and smallness completes the greatness of virtue and power. Being centered controls the external—when the heart attains, things attain. Acting with softness yet strength, power is invincible, and no enemy can overcome it. Responding to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm it. Without calculation, it follows the times to respond, so the times do not fail it, and things do not harm it.

Those who desire hardness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulating softness becomes hardness; accumulating weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or demise—this is the principle and tendency. Hardness conquers what is inferior to itself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is blocked. Softness conquers what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable. Thus, what it conquers surpasses its equal. Moreover, what hardness conquers is inferior to itself. Now, what softness conquers is its equal—thus, the victory of softness is great, and how can the power of hardness compare?

Therefore, when armies are strong, they perish; when wood is hard, it breaks; when leather is stiff, it splits. Teeth are firmer than the tongue yet perish first. Thus, softness and weakness are the stems of life, while hardness and strength are the companions of death.

Qi finds harmony in softness and weakness, while form suffers illness in hardness and strength—how much more so in the human Dao, where likes and dislikes reveal what is beneficial and harmful. To initiate is the path to exhaustion, while to follow is the source of success. Directing affairs often leads to failure; adapting to things brings constant success.

One who holds to the Dao to meet change—whether first or last—controls the other. Why? Because they do not lose the means to control others, nor can others control them. Holding to the Dao in its fullness to respond to shifting circumstances allows one to correct oneself through adaptation.

Thus, abiding in stillness and perceiving change enables the first to control the last. Observing change and returning to stillness enables the last to control the first. In both, control lies within oneself, no longer swayed by the vulgar. The so-called "later" aligns with the numerical order and accords with the moment. Following the inevitable pattern and seizing the opportune time for action is the subtlety of holding back.

The vicissitudes of time allow no pause—change is the transformation of the hour. Principle admits no interruption; there is no gap between them. To act first is to overreach; to act later is to fall short. To control before things change is to miss the moment. To control after they change is to confront a fait accompli.

The sun revolves and the moon completes its cycle—time does not linger for man. Thus, the sage does not prize jade disks a foot wide but values an inch of shadow, for time is hard to gain and easy to lose. Only the sage seizes the opportune moment. Therefore, the sage acts in accord with the times and achieves success by relying on available resources. Affairs can thus be fully accomplished, and merit can be steadily established.

Abiding in the Dao of stillness and restraining the feminine principle—guarding the Dao of emptiness and quiet enables discernment of the moment; restraining the feminine and yielding principle enables adaptation to things. Responding to change through compliance, always following and never leading, soft and weak in stillness, composed and settled in tranquility—dwelling in constant virtue with ease. Thus, great merit overcomes all obstacles, and none can contend with it.

Possessing yet appearing empty, things naturally submit. Laozi said: "A mind that harbors schemes and devices within is not pure and unadulterated." To act in response to movement is inexhaustible in application. Emptying oneself of all else, one returns to simplicity. Relying on cunning and skill only disturbs stillness and introduces impurity.

One whose spiritual power is not complete within cannot embrace what is distant. Only with spiritual wholeness can one reach the ultimate transformation; only with complete virtue can one restore things. The beauty of returning to the distant lies entirely within oneself.

When the mind is free of harmful intent, one may grasp the tail of a starving tiger—how much more so with men? Alike yet not identical, avoidance lies in resolve. Now, utterly desireless, one takes the Creator as form. Even the fiercest and most resolute, without provocation, cannot harm.

Thus, those who embody the Dao are at ease yet never exhausted; those who rely on calculations labor without success. *Calculations here refer to manipulative techniques.*

To govern through harsh laws and punishments is not the work of true kingship. Relying on harsh laws to refine punishments only proves that spiritual power is incomplete and insufficient to transform the world. Frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to guide a chariot to distant lands. Excessive reliance on the whip reveals a loss of natural control, rendering one unable to endure the long journey.

Excessive likes and dislikes invite misfortune to follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but were based on existing conditions. They adapted to the times, adding or subtracting to implement teachings—not creating laws to flaunt their ability. Their prohibitions and punishments were not self-imposed but were upheld. They maintained prohibitions to instill fear in the people, not to display their authority.

Thus, adaptation leads to greatness, while contrivance leads to pettiness. Steadfastness ensures stability, while forced action leads to failure. Those who rely on ears and eyes to listen and see exhaust their minds without clarity. Those who govern through cunning and planning wear themselves out without success.

When a ruler illuminates the four directions and comprehends the four corners, perfect governance is achieved with ease. Relying on the talent of a single person is insufficient for good governance—for even one person’s ability cannot manage a three-acre homestead. Strength and wisdom extend no further.

Following the natural patterns of the Dao and aligning with the inherent nature of heaven and earth, even the six directions cannot be made equal. Moreover, harmonizing with the essence of things and their inherent principles is the inevitable course. Thus, though the world be vast, without exhausting wisdom or strength, the myriad transformations naturally attain balance.

He who trusts his ears will falter in hearing; he who trusts his eyes will be dazzled by sight. Praise and blame mislead the ear, while dazzling colors seduce the eye. Ritual propriety is insufficient to manifest love, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Those who scrutinize ritual merely refine its forms; the heart that seeks to love may yet fail to achieve it. Only by extending sincerity throughout the world can one evoke a response.

Thus, in warfare, nothing is more perilous than the will sharpened like a sword—such resolve disrupts harmony and poisons the art of war. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet the war drum is but a trifle. When joy and anger assail one another, the enemy is at its most severe. The so-called great enemy leaves corpses uncounted, its unchecked commands harming the people. The middle enemy lurks in the mountains, seizing advantage from hidden strongholds. The petty enemy hides among the people, engaging in stealth and theft.

Thus it is said: when the people abound in cunning, strange artifices proliferate. Excessive cleverness breeds skill, and skill breeds pride in ability. Carving and adorning the unadorned, they deceive the world with falsity. The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arise. Seeking to halt theft by cutting off profit, even with a profusion of strict laws, only leads to theft of the laws themselves, increasing the number of offenders. Abandon one path and take another, and heavenly calamity will not arise. Forsake the laws of cunning and cleverness, embrace the uncarved simplicity of non-action, and the reproaches of heaven will cease.

Thus, to govern the state with cleverness is to plunder it; relying solely on one’s own wisdom is to harm the people. To govern the state without cleverness is to bestow virtue upon it. Governing by following the natural course, all things attain their true nature.

The formless is vast, the formed is small; spiritual transformation is boundless and thus great, while the myriad things have limits and thus are small. The formless is many, the formed is few; the unfathomable is many, the visible is few. The formless is strong, the formed is weak; it masters things and thus is strong, while things are mastered and thus are weak. The formless is real, the formed is hollow; the enduring is real, the transient is hollow.

The formed brings things to completion, the formless initiates them. Completion produces vessels, initiation produces the uncarved. The formed has sound, the formless has none. When scattered into vessels, names arise. Returning to the Dao, names cannot be found. The formed arises from the formless, thus the formless is the origin of the formed.

Breadth and thickness bear names, and what bears a name is esteemed and valued. Frugality and thinness are nameless, and the nameless is base and light. Breadth and thickness are the world’s fine reputation. Frugality and thinness are the Daoist’s pure virtue. What the world values is elevated by its name; what I relinquish is entrusted to its reality. The sage holds to the Dao in humility and frugality, making these the foundation of breadth and thickness. Embracing virtue without wavering, he returns to the root of merit and fame.

The following lines are of the same import: abundance and wealth bear names, and what bears a name is honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity are nameless, and the nameless is lowly and despised. The male and potent bear names, and what bears a name is manifest and illustrious. The female and yielding are nameless, and the nameless is subtle and restrained. Surplus bears a name, and what bears a name is exalted and wise. Deficiency is nameless, and the nameless is content with lowliness. Merit bears a name, lack of merit is nameless.

Breadth, thickness, abundance, and wealth are the fruits of having. Frugality, thinness, poverty, and scarcity are the fruits of not having. Names arise from visible traces; where traces are faint, names do not reach. Thus the world esteems merit as fine, while the Dao values the nameless as virtue. The named arises from the nameless; the nameless is the mother of the named. Dwelling in the namelessness of frugality and scarcity, one attains the fullness of honor and nobility.

The Way of heaven is such that being and non-being give rise to one another, and difficulty and ease complete one another. Form and nature arise from the interplay of being and non-being; the principles of affairs arise from the interplay of difficulty and ease. Not knowing how this is so is called the Way of heaven. Therefore, the sage holds to the Dao in emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery, thereby perfecting virtue. To hold to the nameless Dao is to achieve great virtue.

Thus, with the Dao comes virtue, with virtue comes merit, with merit comes fame, and with fame one returns to the Dao. Forgetting the fame of saving the world, one reverts to the non-action of the Dao. With enduring merit and fame, one remains free from blame throughout life. The merit of no-merit endures; the fame of forgotten fame—what blame could there be?

Kings and dukes possess merit and fame, while the orphaned and widowed have none. Thus the sage calls himself orphaned and widowed, returning to his root. All great achievements and illustrious reputations arise from humility. Therefore, the orphaned and widowed are the titles of kings and dukes, for humility is their foundation.

Achieving merit without claiming it, one uses merit for benefit and the nameless for application. The merit of aiding the world borrows the lives of the multitude for benefit; the nameless Dao entrusts its application to the great. In ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. They were utterly unadorned. Their appearance did not depart from their true nature; form and spirit were united. Words did not outstrip deeds; speech and action were one. Their gait was unadorned, free of affectation. Their speech was plain, unembellished. Their clothes provided warmth without ornament, serving only to ward off the cold. Their weapons were blunt and edgeless, for they knew not the art of cunning harm.

They walked with carefree abandon, their gaze unfocused and wandering. They drank from wells and ate from the fields they tilled, seeking nothing beyond their immediate needs. They neither gave nor sought, each content with sufficiency. High and low did not vie with one another, long and short did not compare. They harbored no thoughts of right or wrong.

The winds align with customs, and so one may follow them—when customs are uniform, they may be followed. Affairs match abilities, and so they are easily done—when undertakings suit one’s capacity, they are easily accomplished. To pride oneself on deceit to delude the world, or to act with obstinacy to mislead the multitude—these the sage does not take as the people’s customs.

For if a ruler exalts false appearances to disorder governance and teaching, or persists in perverse conduct to confuse the masses, then customs will diverge and fail to unify, and affairs will not align with ability. Thus, the sage does not employ such means as the foundation of governance.

**Essay on Refined Sincerity**

Refinement begins with investigating the subtlest truths; sincerity is the perfection of simplicity and utmost clarity. When these two names are fulfilled, one may move all things and penetrate the Dao.

Laozi said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth, the sun and moon shine, the stars and constellations gleam, yin and yang harmonize—not through any deliberate action. This is the response of utmost refinement, yet one knows not how it comes to be, as though a true master were present.

Align with the Dao, and things are naturally so. All things possess their own inherent Dao; if one can accord with them without transgression, then things attain their nature and govern themselves. Yin and yang, the four seasons—they do not generate the myriad things. Rain and dew fall in their time—not to nurture grasses and trees. Heaven’s constant virtue and things’ regular growth arise without knowledge of their source; each simply grows of itself.

When spirit connects and yin-yang harmonizes, the myriad things are born. When spirits interact, mechanisms respond; when qi converges, forms arise. To fathom their origin, refined sincerity may be discerned.

The Dao conceals essence within, for the sake of ending frivolous song. It lodges spirit in the heart, for the sake of shedding encumbrances. Serene and tranquil, it delights and unites within the breast, harmonious yet without attachment. Vast and formless, silent and soundless.

Those who embody the Dao enact transformations without trace and teachings without words. Offices and courts seem devoid of affairs; courts and halls seem devoid of people. Each governs itself, so there are no affairs; non-action prevails, so there are no people. No recluses, no idle folk—when governance accords with the Dao, where would they hide or stray? No forced labor, no unjust punishments—with non-action and impartiality, how could there be grievances or toil?

The world looks up to the ruler’s virtue, emulating the sovereign’s intent. When the sage presides above, all under heaven submit to his purity and stillness, mirroring his desireless aim. Distant lands and alien customs, none fail to come through repeated translation—not because he visits each household or meets each person, but because virtue, through compliance, transforms all, near and far.

Extend one’s sincere heart to the world, and that is all. When the heart is sincere, things respond. If a ruler extends sincerity, nothing fails to answer. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent are policies, but what enables their execution is refined sincerity. When trustworthiness and integrity are firmly established, policies will be carried out; when rewards and punishments are impartial, the people know encouragement.

Though commands may be clear, they cannot act alone; they must await refined sincerity. Therefore, to unite the Dao and bestow it upon the people yet fail to be followed is because refined sincerity is not all-encompassing. That which is refined must be excellent; that which is sincere must respond.

Laozi said: Heaven sets the sun and moon, arrays the stars and constellations, unfolds the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. The three luminaries and four qi never depend on one another; observing their spontaneity, each transforms alone. The sun dries things by day, the night lets them rest, the wind desiccates them, rain and dew moisten them.

In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow—things receive life and grow of themselves, without any nourisher. In destroying things, none see how they perish, yet the myriad things die—things observe their own transformations, without any destroyer. This is called spirit and illumination. That which cannot be fathomed in its origin is called spirit; that which inevitably changes is called illumination.

Thus, the sage models himself on this. When fortune arises, one does not see its cause, yet fortune arises—the world’s blessings lie in the sage’s Dao being practiced. When virtue aligns with the times, how can there be traces? When misfortune is removed, one does not see its source, yet misfortune is removed—preserving the fortune of the Dao’s practice, there may be adversity, but when sagely governance nurtures order, nothing can be perceived.

Scrutiny finds no origin of removal or rise; investigation confirms the reality of fortune and misfortune. Daily reckoning falls short; yearly reckoning yields surplus. Measuring progress day by day, it seems insufficient; yet in the end, affairs are completed, as virtue is perfected over time. Silent and soundless—only subtle resonance remains.

A single word that profoundly moves all under heaven—this is called utmost sincerity, by which the heart of heaven is stirred to transform. Without intent, it yet elicits response. Sincerity takes form within qi, moving heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, rivers do not overflow, and seas remain calm without surging waves. When sincerity reaches luminous clarity, such correspondences arise.

To defy heaven and ravage the world is to invite the sun and moon’s obscuration, the five planets’ errant paths, the four seasons’ disorder—this is called qi exceeding its proper measure. Day darkens while night shines, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, winter thunders and summer frosts—when qi steams upward in excess, such portents occur. Heaven and humanity share a means of mutual resonance; disasters and auspices arise from what is thus evoked.

Thus, when a state declines toward ruin, celestial patterns shift, the age falls into chaos, and rainbows appear—all things are interconnected, and essence-qi presses closely upon one another. The entanglement of forms, the encroachment of qi—all are signs of lost alignment. Therefore, the workings of spirit and illumination cannot be achieved through cunning or force, nor can they be attained by sheer effort. Only through perfect sincerity and utmost truth may governance be established.

Thus, the great person harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth, luminosity with the sun and moon, numinous power with ghosts and spirits, and trustworthiness with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, they harbor no private intent; holding the qi of earth, they follow tranquility as their nature. Grasping the central void and embracing harmony, they wield the central void to settle all affairs and contain harmony to govern the myriad beings. Without leaving the hall, their virtue and beneficence extend to the four seas.

The transformation of customs and the people’s shift toward goodness arise as if naturally—this is the power of spiritual transformation. Governance lies within oneself; without spiritual transformation, who else could be entrusted with it?

Laozi said: "For the human Way, to preserve one’s nature and safeguard authenticity, never harming the self—this is the constant Dao of humanity. When pressed by urgency or adversity, essence penetrates heaven." The supreme mystery’s mirror is impartial and luminous. Utmost sincerity moves it, and there is nothing it does not respond to—thus in conflict or distress, none fail to be resolved through sincerity. Though not yet fully aligned with spontaneity, this is still a momentary attainment. As for those who never depart from their root—what could they not accomplish? To take essence and sincerity as one’s root is to leave nothing unachieved.

Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overborne. One who equalizes life and death cannot be threatened by death. How much more so for those who govern heaven and earth, embrace the myriad beings, reverse creation, and contain utmost harmony—have they ever truly died? Knowing that death and life occupy the same domain, one does not lightly fear; how much less so for those who embody the Dao, encompassing heaven and earth, merging with transformation and harmony, becoming one with the Creator—could they not attain undying longevity?

Essence and sincerity take form within, and their resonance reaches the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When essence and sincerity are inwardly manifest and outwardly align with human hearts, this arises from the deepest sincerity, far beyond what words can convey. When the sage occupies the throne, dwelling in the Dao without speech, their beneficence extends to the myriad people—thus the teaching without words is vast indeed.

When the center is empty, things follow; when the body is upright, the people emulate. Is not the transformation of daily life equally vast? When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery appear in heaven, and the resonance of spirit and qi grows faint. The ruler embodies the Way of governance and transformation, while the minister carries it to completion—gains and losses are shared, fortunes and misfortunes move as one. Yet if discordant hearts breed cunning, causing perverse qi to rise and steam upward, then the Way of spiritual transformation will find no resonance. This is what is meant by "the eloquence of silence" and "the Dao that cannot be spoken."

The former refers to the teaching without words, the latter to the Dao beyond speech. To summon the distant, let there be non-action; for those nearby, let there be no affairs. When governance and instruction multiply, taxes and labor grow burdensome—then those close at hand cannot attend to their tasks, and those far away cannot hold their duties in mind. Thus the Way of heaven is non-action, responding without call; the sage is without affairs, drawing near without seeking.

Only the night-walker may possess it—silently employing it in accord with yin, its virtue nears the Dao most closely. Thus the turning back of galloping steeds to manure the fields: the reckless rush of desires is likewise called "galloping steeds"; manure, then, can fatten and nourish the sprouting shoots. Therefore the enlightened ruler outwardly turns back the gallop of warhorses to enrich the fields and gardens, and inwardly removes the rushing torrent of desires to cultivate virtue and the Dao. When no chariot tracks reach beyond distant lands, this is called "sitting still while racing, sinking while afloat." With hands folded and seated in governance, transformation spreads to far-off lands—silently acting without trace is to dwell on land yet sink as if submerged.

The Way of heaven approaches without partiality, departs without partiality; without favor or bias, it does not involve itself in coming or going. The capable have abundance, the clumsy fall short; those who follow it gain advantage, those who oppose it meet misfortune. Those who accord with the principles of nature act with surplus benefit; those who rely on the surface of cunning and calculation find themselves powerless and doomed. Thus those who govern by wisdom struggle to maintain the state; only those who align with the Great Harmony and hold to natural response can truly possess it. When the heart of heaven’s Way accords with the seasons and principles, this is called the Great Harmony.

If the ruler severs cleverness and artifice to align with harmony, and holds to impartiality in responding to things, then he may be entrusted with safeguarding the world. Laozi said: The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and tanned leather—distance makes them seem near, nearness makes them seem distant; examined, they cannot be grasped; scrutinized, they do not deceive. The Dao and virtue lodge their use in being and non-being; rawhide and leather manifest their sound in emptiness and solidity. They respond when moved, yet when sought, they have no fixed form. Truly, they are beyond the measure of the heart and mind—how much more beyond the reach of ears and eyes?

Thus the sage is like a mirror: neither leading nor welcoming, responding yet not storing, leaving the myriad things unharmed. Impartial, he entrusts things to their own nature, and transformation comes to meet him. By following and responding to them, he remains unharmed. What he gains is thus what he loses—if he clings to what he has gained in his breast, he loses its wondrous use. What he loses is thus what he gains—only in utter emptiness can reflection occur.

Therefore, one who penetrates the Great Harmony is darkly serene as if steeped in pure wine, sweetly drifting within it, as if never having left its source—this is called the Great Permeation. The sweet intoxication of rich wine still preserves the portion of perfect peace and rest; in profound accord with inner and outer, it harmonizes with the unity of heaven and earth. If one releases the heart into the realm of self-attained origin, roams the spirit in the boundless expanse, though traces mingle with things, what hindrance remains? This is the feigned disuse that accomplishes its use. The world deems emotion and cleverness as disuse, yet here, this feigned disuse pairs with the uses of a thousand transformations.

Laozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world harmonized the movements of the sun and moon, regulated the qi of yin and yang, ordered the measures of the four seasons, corrected the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguished male and female, and clarified superior and inferior—these were the creations of ritual and law. In the age of the Yellow Emperor, the people had lost their true simplicity, and artifice and deceit arose; cunning and force came to the fore. Thus he looked up to observe and bent down to examine, governing through change and non-action. Though this truly benefited his time, none foresaw the troubles of ten thousand generations.

He ensured the strong did not overpower the weak, the many did not oppress the few; the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons ripened without famine. The hundred officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors harmonized without blame; laws and commands were clear and not obscured, aides were just and not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries, roads left no lost items, markets had no fraudulent pricing—thus the achievements of his governance were manifest. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars did not stray from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards, and qilin roamed the outskirts—such were the responses of virtue in action.

When Fuxi ruled the world, he rested his head on a square pillow and slept on a straight mat, emulating autumn’s harvest and winter’s storage. The dark sage’s actions did not transgress heaven’s net, so his bedding was square and straight. Autumn’s things reach maturity, winter’s things lie hidden—this is returning to the root. Thus the sage followed the reaping of these two seasons, restraining and completing filial piety, embodying the virtue of returning to the root. Bearing the square earth, embracing the round heaven, the Dao encompasses heaven and earth.

The yin and yang they embrace. Where there is obstruction and blockage, the apertures and principles regulate it. When virtue harmonizes with the Great Harmony, qi governs itself. Those who oppose qi and violate things, harming the people through excessive accumulation—cut them off. Once heaven and earth are at peace, disasters vanish of themselves.

At that time, the people were like unknowing children, unaware of east or west, walking unsteadily, seeing dimly, yet content in their simplicity, not knowing whence they came—this has already been seen in the *Dao Yuan* chapter. Floating and drifting, they knew not their origin; without nurture, they knew not their destination. Not yet cherishing their kin, they took things as their root. Since things were but temporary lodgings, their root had nowhere to go. Those who floated without nurture were all unbound and unmoored.

In that age, birds and beasts, insects and snakes—none failed to sheathe their claws and fangs, conceal their stings and poisons, for they knew not how to prey upon one another. Their merit measured up to heaven and earth. The merit of non-action was thus comparable to heaven and earth.

Yet the Yellow Emperor humbled himself beneath the Great Ancestor, though his deeds went unproclaimed, his name unheralded. Not proclaiming his deeds, his deeds were already proclaimed; not heralding his name, his name was already heralded. When the Yellow Emperor vanquished Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, though he removed a scourge, he returned to the Great Ancestor, and his traces of reverence and deference were already manifest for posterity. "Humbled," here, denotes a modest and unassuming demeanor.

He concealed the Way of the True Man, following the inherent order of heaven and earth—heaven’s exaltation, earth’s humility, spring’s generation, autumn’s harvest—these are the natural principles. Yet the Yellow Emperor modeled himself on this exaltation and humility to establish robes and garments, measured the seasons to carry out punishments and campaigns, thereby illuminating the Way of the True Man while obscuring the virtue of the sage, daily renewing himself in the world. Why? Because when the Dao and virtue ascend, cunning and knowledge naturally fade away. If one’s virtue aligns with heaven, then the artifices of wisdom and skill become discarded things.

Laozi said: "If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand. If the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form." Only when the self is tranquil can it be upright—such is the principle of right and wrong.

Thus, only with the True Man does true knowledge arise—casting aside the deluded knowledge of the world to perceive true knowledge. If what one holds is not clear, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance? To employ the deluded knowledge of the world to clarify true knowledge is difficult indeed.

What is called true knowledge is knowledge without right or wrong. How then can the world’s knowledge of right and wrong be true knowledge? It is not true knowledge.

Accumulating wisdom and valuing wealth, making the people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is benevolence. Frugality leads to valuing wealth; abundant grace leads to accumulating kindness. Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, ordering lord and subject, rectifying high and low, clarifying near and far, preserving those in peril, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the childless—this is righteousness. All these are裁断 to fit what is appropriate.

Closing the nine apertures, concealing the will and intent, discarding cleverness and intelligence, returning to non-discernment—such is the principle of fully preserving life and safeguarding one’s nature. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—vague and unknowing, beyond fame and profit, adapting to circumstances, neither gain nor loss able to burden one—this is the bearing of one who inhales yin and exhales yang, merging with the ten thousand things in profound unity. Following the great constancy of yin and yang, harmonizing with the nature of things—this is virtue.

Thus, the Dao disperses and becomes virtue; virtue overflows and becomes benevolence and righteousness. "Overflows" means to lose. Benevolence and righteousness are established, and the Dao and virtue are abandoned. For to depart from true simplicity and cause things to attain the Dao’s dispersion into virtue is the meaning of this.

Therefore, when emerging from the natural, one attains the position of the Supreme. When virtue is about to be established, the traces upon which it depends become manifest. Once manifest, to preserve them without overflow is impossible. Thus, excess arises from benevolence and righteousness.

To govern things through benevolence and righteousness is to hang the teachings of allurement and admiration prominently in the world, while the virtue of attaining the natural Dao suffers no loss. Is this not a deficiency?

Laozi said: "When the spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue drifts, conduct becomes false." The spirit serves to reflect things, virtue to perfect conduct. Thus, when the spirit is scattered and fleeting, words lose their substance; when virtue flows and drifts, conduct loses its truth.

When the utmost essence is lost within, yet words and deeds are observed without, this is inevitably to be enslaved by things. Once scattered and drifting, the inner self lacks sincerity, and one observes external things, uttering words and forming deeds. In this way, one is enslaved by things and cannot preserve oneself.

He also said: "When there is no sincerity within, yet words and deeds occupy the realm of observation, this deludes and deceives the people, causing them to follow unprincipled governance and imitate expedient laws. The worthy, through excessive caution, withdraw from the world; the foolish, through daily practice, make it their nature. Thus, those in positions of power are not steadfast and are enslaved by things."

When essence is exhausted and consumed while conduct knows no limit, what one holds is unstable, and one is led astray by the winds of worldly custom. "Consumed" means depleted. Enslaved by things, there comes a time of exhaustion. Yet when all standards are enacted, how can there be a limit? Responding to every kind of conduct with incomplete essence, with an inherently unstable foundation, how can one avoid being led astray by custom?

Thus, the sage inwardly cultivates the arts of the Dao and does not outwardly adorn himself with benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine apertures and four limbs, he wanders in the harmony of spirit—this is the sage’s wandering. One who embodies the Dao to perfect the mind’s expansion will find the merits of benevolence and righteousness naturally manifest without. One who preserves essence and encounters with spirit will find the proper order of the body naturally at peace within. Yet if a single thing is obstructed, it cannot be called wandering. Now, with both inner and outer in accord, is this not the sage’s wandering?

Laozi said: "As for the True Man’s wandering, it moves in the utmost emptiness, unaware of any obstruction."

Wandering the mind in the great void, unaware of what exists.
Racing beyond the bounds, unaware of what burdens.
Moving through no gate, unaware of whence it comes.
Listening to the soundless, gazing at the formless—
only in stillness, only in silence lies the true wandering.
Unrestrained by the world, unbound by custom.
One bound by things is no longer wandering.

Thus, what the sage employs to move all under heaven
does not exceed the True Man’s way—
saving the age, transforming the people,
are but traces of deliberate action.
Returning to virtue, shifting toward goodness,
is this not movement?
Yet those who embody truth do not go so far as this.

What the worthy employ to correct世俗
the sage does not observe:
lofty conduct, pure integrity,
emotions and nature as outward adornment,
leading above and entangling below—
is this not affectation?
Thus, the sage of great transformation does not even glance at such things.

One constrained by世俗
must have the form bound and the spirit dissipated,
and so cannot escape burden.
Form bound: restrained by ritual and law.
Spirit dissipated: scattered by cunning and care.
Dissipated without end, the spirit will be lost.
Bound without end, the essence will be exhausted.
Both exhausted and lost—
is this not a burden upon life’s great root?

If I can be bound and constrained,
my fate must lie in what is external.
This is indeed so.
If I am surely bound by ritual and law,
then the portion of Heaven’s mandate is wholly subject to external things.

Laozi said:
When the ruler’s thoughts
do not race within his breast,
nor his wisdom extend beyond the four quarters,
his spirit tranquil and self-transforming,
his knowledge then prevents the people’s deceit.
Embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity,
sweet rain falls in season,
the five grains flourish,
spring’s birth, summer’s growth,
autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—
monthly inspections, seasonal reviews,
year’s end tribute presented.
When the ruler’s sincerity moves Heaven
and his benevolence nurtures those below,
Heaven responds, the people comply,
the hundred officials do not neglect their duties,
the nine provinces yearly offer their local tribute.
Nurturing the people with impartiality,
non-action achieves this.

The stern yet insincere cannot awe without severity;
laws concise yet not onerous,
transform like the divine.
When laws are lenient and punishments mild,
prisons stand empty.
The realm shares one custom,
none harbor deceitful hearts.
When governance accords with the people’s nature
and rests in their customary livelihoods,
how could wickedness arise?
This is the grace of the sage.
The sage’s governance of the people
is fully encompassed herein.

When the ruler’s desires are boundless,
his ministers grow greedy for merit and refuse deference.
The ruler’s cravings know no limit,
and his ministers usurp his fame and achievements.
When the people are impoverished and distressed,
strife and contention arise.
Taxes multiply in form,
and the people grow impoverished and distressed.
Oppressed and hard-pressed,
they inevitably contend.
Labor is spent in vain,
crafting useless implements.
Cunning and deceit sprout,
thieves and bandits flourish.
Cunning and deceit arise
because the ruler covets profit.
When the pursuit of gain knows no end,
one cannot but steal to satisfy desire.
Ruler and subject grow mutually resentful,
and decrees go unheeded.

When water is turbid, fish gasp;
when governance is harsh, the people rebel.
Muddy waters cloud the stream,
and fish cannot swim in ease,
so they pant and gasp to seek respite.
When governance is vexatious and severe,
the people no longer rest in their livelihoods,
and they drift into disorder to survive.

When the ruler’s desires are many,
his subjects grow cunning.
They devise deceit to serve his cravings.
When the ruler is restless,
his subjects grow unsettled.
When the ruler’s demands are many,
his subjects contend with one another.
To address the branches without curing the root
is no different from digging a channel to stop water
or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.

To govern without virtue and power,
relying instead on punishments and laws,
is a method that only increases chaos.
Thus the sage governs with few affairs yet brings order,
seeks little yet provides abundance.
Simplicity is easily followed,
so order is achieved.
Seeking little ensures constant sufficiency,
so all are provided for.

Without action, there is benevolence—
tranquility preserves wholeness.
Without speech, there is trust—
accord elicits natural response.
Without seeking, there is attainment—
sufficiency precludes contention.
Without effort, there is accomplishment—
trusting others brings fulfillment.

Embracing the natural,
preserving utmost authenticity,
holding to the Dao and extending sincerity,
the realm follows as echo answers sound,
as shadow mirrors form.
What is cultivated is the root.
Cultivate the self, and the people are upright;
inward sincerity elicits outward response.

Laozi said:
When spirit scatters outward
and wisdom and thought churn within,
one cannot govern the body.
Humans live by form and qi.
Form stores essence,
qi settles spirit.
If one is enslaved by things,
this harms the spirit,
exhausting wisdom and thought while the form declines.
The principles of life are thus inevitably disrupted.
When spirit is employed afar,
what is neglected is near.
When spirit strays far,
the near—one’s form—is neglected.

Thus one who does not step beyond the door knows the world,
one who does not peer through the window knows the Dao of Heaven—
this speaks of one whose spirit is whole.
By listening with qi,
the sentiments of the myriad things may be known.
By observing with spirit,
the principles of the myriad transformations may be verified.
Within the three realms,
sincerity resonates and connects—
how could one rely on doors and windows for observation?

The farther one ventures,
the less one knows.
Restless activity without cease
further loses true knowledge.
This speaks of sincerity arising within,
spirit and qi moving throughout the world.

Laozi said:
The winter sun’s warmth,
the summer sun’s coolness—
the myriad things turn to them
yet none compel their swift return.
This is the natural resonance of utmost essence,
coming unbidden, departing without farewell.
Winter’s warmth and summer’s coolness
are the nature to which things return.
Though the four seasons swiftly change,
this remains constant—
the fullness of the Dao of mutual resonance.

In profound obscurity,
unaware of what is done,
yet success is achieved.
If one could grasp its workings,
it would not be profound obscurity—
this speaks of the daily renewal of yin and yang’s unfathomable workings.

To rely on sight for illumination,
on speech for command,
governance becomes difficult.
Gaoyao was mute yet served as grand judge,
and the realm knew no cruel punishments—
was speech truly necessary?
Shikuang was blind yet served as grand minister,
and Jin suffered no misrule—
was sight truly necessary?
This is not relying on sight for illumination.
Commands without speech,
perception without sight—
this is how the sage serves as teacher.

Extending sincerity elicits unbidden response;
trusting ability brings clarity without scrutiny.
This is how the sage governs the realm,
founding his teaching herein.

The people’s transformation by their superiors
does not follow their words,
but their conduct.
Conduct is the outward sign of sincerity,
so the people submit to transformation from above.
Words are the flower of reality,
so they are not yet trusted below.

Thus when the ruler favors valor,
though he does not incite strife,
the state suffers many calamities,
and gradually banditry and murder arise.
When the ruler favors beauty,
though he does not encourage licentious talk,
the state suffers many disorders,
and over time debauchery and excess follow.
The transformation of those below by those above
follows this principle.

Thus the sage’s sincerity is refined within,
its distinctions clear.

The inner radiance is thus called "distinction."
When likes and dislikes are manifest externally,
words issue forth to match the emotions,
and decrees are proclaimed to clarify intent.

Therefore, punishments are insufficient to alter customs,
and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy—
without inner refinement of sincerity,
laws and commands cannot prevail externally.

Only spiritual transformation is esteemed,
esteemed for its traceless transformation.
When essence reaches its utmost, it becomes spirit;
its movement is like the spring’s generation
and the autumn’s withering.
The resonance of essence
leaves no thing unaligned.
Without virtue, there is no resentment—
like the ceaseless flow of the two qi.

Thus the noble person resembles an archer:
a hairsbreadth’s deviation here
becomes a span’s error there.
A single arrow’s misalignment by a hairsbreadth
results in a span’s miss at the target.
If even the finest thread or mustard seed presents such difficulty in precision,
how much farther does its resonance reach?
Therefore, those who govern must be cautious in what they evoke.

Laozi said: "When laws are displayed and rewards established,
yet customs remain unchanged,
it is because sincerity is not embraced."
When the ruler extends sincerity outward,
all things trust and transgress not.
Relying on cunning for governance,
the people deceive and seek mere escape.
Though laws are hung to forbid violence
and rewards set to encourage goodness,
they cannot transform shallow customs and thin morals.

Thus, hearing a sound reveals its prevailing wind;
emotion stirs, and voice arises.
When patterns form, goodness becomes evident.
Yet by listening to sound, one takes its tone;
by examining tone, one perceives intent.
Intent bears resentment or harmony,
and the state’s prevailing customs are thereby known.

Observe its music to know its customs.
Music’s essence harmonizes the people and guides governance;
its notes are pure, gathering all things in order.
Yet it is moved by order or chaos,
and suited to the climate’s disposition—
thus the local customs may be discerned.
See its customs to know its transformation.
What the common people esteem
arises directly from the ruler’s influence.

Those who embrace truth and offer sincerity
move heaven and earth,
their spirit transcending all bounds.
With commands issued and prohibitions enforced,
embracing utmost truth and offering unfeigned sincerity,
heaven and earth respond to their resonance—
how much more so do people?
Thus they transform even beyond the eight directions,
wherever the heart’s decree reaches.

When sincerity penetrates the Dao and conveys its intent,
though not a word is spoken,
the myriad people, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits
all undergo transformation with it.
If sincerity can fully penetrate this Dao,
even the hidden and the alien—
who could fail to resonate with it?

Thus the highest governance is spiritual transformation,
while below, the worthy are rewarded and the violent punished.
To align with things without trace—
this is the pinnacle of transformation.
When the people cannot bear to deceive,
this is the attainment of governance.
To rely solely on punishments and rewards—
this is the lowest form of rule.

Laozi said: "The Great Dao is non-action,
embodying stillness and tranquility.
Non-action means non-existence,
and its embodiment is formless.
Non-existence does not abide,
having no fixed place or direction.
Not abiding means dwelling in formlessness,
omnipresent.
Formless means unmoving,
empty and thus uncreated.
Unmoving means wordless,
its principle transcending names and traces.
Wordless means silent and formless—
with names and traces absent,
how could echoes or shadows remain?
Silent and formless,
it cannot be seen or heard.
Eyes and ears
are limited to forms and sounds.
This is called the subtle and wondrous,
its essence hidden and refined,
its function profoundly mysterious.
This is called the utmost spirit,
for it bestows life and completion without leaving a trace—
such is the perfection of spirit.

It endures ceaselessly, as if present—
this is called the root of heaven and earth.
The Dao’s body is empty and still,
generating and transforming without bound,
enduring without end—
thus it is the foundation of the great cosmos.

The Dao is formless and soundless,
so the sage forcibly gives it form,
using a single phrase as its name.
The Dao originally has no substance—
how could sound be established?
Yet the sage forcibly adopts the shape of a path
to designate the nameless body.
One phrase unifies the myriad images,
one thread penetrates nature and destiny.
Though a single phrase surpasses all speech,
it encompasses form and sound,
and all under heaven follow its course.

The Dao of heaven and earth
takes the small as its foundation,
the many as beginning with the few.
Heaven and earth, vast as they are,
take the minute as their root.
The myriad images, boundless as they are,
begin with the One.
The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard,
the myriad things as his resources.
His merit and virtue are supreme,
his power and renown most exalted.
The Supreme Heaven sends forth the sage to oversee all beings,
using heaven and earth to establish the ranks of honor and lowliness,
and borrowing the myriad things to complete the resources of nobility and baseness—
thus he attains utmost virtue.

The sage’s achievements rescue the world,
his illustrious name and majestic power
command reverence across the seas.
The beauty of these two virtues
matches heaven and earth.
Taking heaven and earth as his standard
and the myriad things as his resources,
he fulfills these two great virtues of nobility and vastness—
thus he may be compared to the two primal forces.

Yet in relation to heaven,
there is no place where virtue is not established—
and to call this position "virtue" is fitting.
Therefore, one must not deviate
from the Great Dao as the mother of all under heaven.

Having matched virtue’s position to heaven and earth,
and equaled its function to creation,
how could one fail to uphold the Dao’s law,
abiding in non-action,
so that all under heaven use it daily without awareness?

Laozi said: "Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent
is called generating benefit and initiating action;
removing harm is called achieving merit.
Merit and fame arise from action."
Relieving the poor and rescuing the distressed
inevitably incur the floating reputation of benevolence
and the minor profit of righteous aid.
If the world were free of disasters,
even the sage would have no place to apply his virtue—
were all under heaven to attain their due,
where would the sage’s virtue find expression?
If superiors and inferiors were harmonious,
even the worthy would have no place to establish their merit—
were ruler and minister, father and son each to fulfill their roles,
where would the worthy’s merit find realization?

Thus the governance of the perfected person
embraces virtue and holds to the Dao,
extending sincerity with boundless wisdom,
restraining speech without utterance—
and all under heaven, not knowing its value, honor his silence.

To leave traces of established virtue
is not to embrace virtue."

To follow the Dao in one’s course is not to embrace the Dao.
Only when one reaches its ultimate state is one called a perfected person—
for this is simply to extend sincerity from within,
letting things right themselves of their own accord.
Though his discernment knows no bounds,
he rests in wordless mystery,
dwelling in stillness like a corpse within his humble chamber,
while the hundred clans transform themselves.
How could the mediocre masses of the world value his wordless Way?

Thus, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;
the name that can be named is not the constant name."
The Dao that can be made into an object is not the constant Dao of spontaneity;
the name that can be assigned is not the constant name of quiescent essence.
Therefore, the perfected person does not abide in such things.
Inscribed on bamboo and silk,
engraved on metal and stone,
transmitted to others—
all these are but its coarse manifestations.
Merits and fame recorded on bamboo and silk,
laws and canons carved into metal and stone,
are all traces of achievement,
not the Dao of non-action.
Weighed and debated, they are indeed coarse.

The Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings
pursued different affairs with the same heart,
took different paths to the same end.
Their hearts shared the same aim of bringing order,
though their policies and transformations differed.
Scholars of later ages,
not grasping the unity embodied in the Dao
or the essentials that virtue gathers,
take the traces of past deeds,
kneel and sit to expound them—
teaching their traces alone fails to encompass all things,
merely revering their leftover words.
Even with broad learning and much knowledge,
they cannot avoid disorder.
Those who hear much of rites and righteousness
are apt to confuse their times,
for these are not the essentials of good governance.

Laozi said:
"The essence of the heart can spiritually transform,
but cannot be spoken of.
The function of essence leaves no trace,
yet things are transformed—
beyond the reach of names and words."
The sage governs all under heaven without leaving his seat,
his influence surpassing the cries of an owl or the shouts of a herald.
Relying on the power of pure sincerity,
his transformation is like an echo.
Thus, the world is rightly ordered.

Words that are alike may be trusted,
but trust lies before the words.
When one among many speakers is uniquely trusted,
it is because his sincerity and trustworthiness were already manifest.
Commands that are alike may be carried out,
but sincerity lies beyond the command.
When one among many issuances is uniquely obeyed,
it is because his sincerity aligns with the command,
and the people all follow.
When the sage is above,
the people are transformed as if by a spirit—
his feelings precede them.
Since his trust lies before his words
and his sincerity beyond his commands,
his transformation is swift as a spirit.

When the ruler acts above but the people do not respond below,
it is because their feelings and commands diverge.
"Feeling" is akin to sincerity.
A three-month-old infant knows nothing of benefit or harm,
yet its loving mother cherishes it all the more—
this is feeling.
How could the infant understand the advantages of closeness or distance?
Yet the deeper the mother’s love,
the clearer the principle of mutual resonance.
Thus, when the hundred clans are without knowledge,
the sage remains without name,
and all respond in harmony.

The function of words brings small change;
the transformation of verbal teaching cannot alter customs.
The function of wordlessness brings great change;
the resonance of pure sincerity transforms all under heaven.
To trust a gentleman’s words
and be loyal to his intentions—
through trust and sincerity,
none fail to follow his words.
With sincerity reaching utmost clarity,
none fail to align with his intentions.
Loyalty and trust take form within,
stirring responses without—
this is the transformation of the worthy and the sage.
The inner manifestation of the Dao
elicits its external effects.
The worthy are called *junzi*,
the sages are called *shengren*—
this shared phrasing means:
the sage embraces the *junzi*’s abilities,
while the *junzi* unfolds the sage’s transformation.

Laozi said:
"When a son dies for his father,
or a minister for his lord,
it is not to seek fame through death—
the heart’s devotion is hidden within,
and they do not shirk from peril."
How could ministers and sons
angle for the reputation of loyalty and filial piety
to face their lord’s or father’s peril?
Yet when gratitude and righteousness stir within,
they naturally forget life and follow duty.

The *junzi*’s sorrow for the world
is not a deliberate act—
it arises from within,
and one must examine his conduct.
The *junzi* cherishes benevolence,
grieving for the age—
not arbitrarily upholding it,
but letting it emerge from within.
Yet if he does not observe the customs of the time
and teach accordingly,
he will fail in governance.

The sage walking at night feels no shame before his shadow—
thus the *junzi* is cautious in solitude.
The sage is without partiality,
the *junzi* holds office.
Though dwelling in darkness,
he never trembles in fear,
nor betrays things—
how could he feel shame before his shadow?

To abandon what is near and seek what is distant is obstruction.
To forsake self-attainment for distant goals—
how can this lead to success?
Thus, when the sage is above,
the people delight in his governance;
when below,
they long for his intentions,
his heart never forgetting the desire to benefit others.
The sage has no private attachments,
yet takes the salvation of all as his aim—
to save without limit is called "aspiration."
Yet this is not the aspiration of deliberate intent.

Thus, when he occupies his position,
the hundred clans all find peace in his virtue and teaching,
admiring his sincerity and purity.
Laozi said:
"A brave warrior’s cry,
and the three armies all retreat—
this is the power of his sincerity."
Bravery is *qi*;
*qi* arises from sincerity,
and the hearts of the three armies are swayed.
Without the *qi* of righteous bravery
and the stirring of shared feeling,
even facing the enemy with weapons in hand,
one could not protect a single life.

When a call goes unanswered,
or an intention is not carried—
there must be a lack of harmony within.
"Within" refers to the meeting point of inner and outer resonance.
If I call and they do not respond,
if I intend and they do not carry it out,
it is because our pure sincerity has not connected.

To govern all under heaven without leaving one’s seat
is to seek it within oneself.
When the heart is sincere, things respond;
when the form is upright, things align.
Thus, where words and teachings do not reach,
the influence of one’s bearing does.
Where the influence of bearing does not reach,
the resonance of pure sincerity must.
The stirrings of the heart take form,
completing the inner so the outer transforms itself.
When essence and form reach their utmost,
one can connect through form,
but cannot rely on it for illumination.

The form refers to bearing, the essence to emotion. The Way of these two transformations may be connected through kindred forms, yet cannot be suspended and expected to manifest on its own. If this is so, then there is something awaited within—how can essence remain pure or form be upright? There has never been one whose form was upright yet failed to move and transform things.

Laozi said: Words have their root, affairs have their foundation. Words have the root of established teachings, affairs have the foundation of creation. Lose their root and foundation, and though one’s skills be many, it is better to speak little. Once root and foundation are lost, proliferation becomes harm, and one cannot even preserve stillness. Those who harm the many are like Yu the craftsman cutting off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced. The skill of Ban and Fei is contrived—when there is action, fame is established but fingers are severed. The skill of creation is non-action, thus its use is fulfilled and its body remains whole.

Thus, the craftsman knows how to close, yet by closing at the right time does not know closure—hence he must block it before opening. Following transformation, succeeding with the times, relying on knowledge and skill will inevitably lead to ruin.

Laozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths yet reach the same end; affairs differ in what they follow, but transformation shares the same destination. Their survival or ruin, stability or collapse, all stem from an unwavering intent to benefit others. Amid these four differences, they do not forget the forgetting of benefiting others.

Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in transmission yet all bring joy; the laments of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Sorrow and joy reside within—no foreign custom can alter them. Song is the sign of joy, weeping the effect of sorrow. Essence within responds without, thus wherever one is, it moves others. Song and weeping are the proof of gain and loss.

The Way of governance and transformation: when life is followed, all rejoice; when nature is suppressed, all grieve. The cause of the myriad things’ resentment or harmony lies entirely in what the ruler above moves. The sage’s heart never forgets its desire to benefit others—how far-reaching is the reach of his grace! Thus, Hua and Yi are all transformed.

Laozi said: When people practice non-action, governance is achieved; when nature is still, peace is attained. Those who act harm the governance of non-action, adding knowledge to affairs and thus injuring the original nature. Those who would practice non-action cannot be without action. Where there is intent to preserve, there is action. Those who cannot be without action cannot truly act. Having lost their own still nature, how can they govern things?

People are wordless and spirit is present—spirit is the essence of vitality. Only in emptiness and quiescence is its full function realized. When there are words, they injure the spirit of wordlessness, for words analyze things and principles, binding them and thus causing harm. To bear wordlessness is to injure the spirit of spirit. Preserving wordlessness in the heart is the heart’s inability to be empty. With this obstruction, the spirit is inevitably harmed.

Wenzi said: Names can be forcibly established, achievements can be forcibly accomplished. Formerly, Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Way alone was absent in himself. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit became clear and bright, his difficulties and distresses smoothed and resolved. Through diligent effort, he went ten days without eating, yet felt as if feasting on a grand sacrifice—tasting the Way and being sated with virtue. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured for generations, his wisdom and strategy encompassed heaven and earth, his discernment reached the finest detail. His praises in the language of Hua continue unceasing to this day—this is what is meant by names being forcibly established. The full account is in the *Kangcangzi*.

Thus, the farmer who does not strive will not fill his granary; the official who does not exert himself will not refine his sincerity; the general and minister who do not strive will not accomplish great deeds; the king and marquis who are indolent will leave no name after death. The profound purport of this chapter takes essence and sincerity as its root. Wenzi feared that世 people would merely wish to preserve sincerity while forgetting strenuous study, hence he set forth these examples to illustrate sincerity.

The perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hiding beneath the earth—his traces unseen. Acting in accord with the times, establishing merit through available means, advancing and retreating without difficulty, he is unobstructed in all things. Adapting to temporal change, harmonizing with the principles of things.

The perfected person’s essence and sincerity take inner form, his virtue flows to the four quarters. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices yet does not forget; seeing harm in the world, he is startled as if having suffered a loss. His nature and principle are profoundly united, thus he has neither gain nor loss. His form follows things, hence his sorrow and joy are as they are.

One who grieves the people’s grief is grieved by the people; one who rejoices in the people’s joy is rejoiced by the people. With my sameness to things, things do not differ from me. Thus, to rejoice with all under heaven and grieve with all under heaven—yet fail to become king—has never been.

Only one who is without intent and merges with all under heaven can be the pen for all under heaven. The perfected person’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. Moved by inner sincerity, thus its beginning cannot be seen; cutting off its old traces, thus its end cannot be attained.

Abiding in an unshakable position, taking tranquility and stillness as foundation. Accumulating in an inexhaustible storehouse, taking profound virtue as root. Bearing in an unfailing treasury, taking self-sufficiency as resource. Issuing commands like the source of flowing water, benefiting things while ever following. Employing the people in offices of non-contention, governing with emptiness and softness. Opening the gate that must be attained, proceeding from ease and thus not losing. Not doing what cannot be accomplished, not altering the materials of things to act. Not seeking what cannot be obtained, not aspiring to what lies beyond one’s lot. Not dwelling where one cannot remain long, departing from arrogance and excess. Not acting in ways that cannot be repeated, leaving behind attachment to complexity.

The great person enacts a government that brings joy—none do not follow his commands. When commands follow the times, they proceed from small to great; when commands run counter, even good becomes harm, success becomes failure. The great person’s governance is simple—none do not rejoice and be transformed. Principle naturally flourishes, while the governance of vexatious severity is the opposite of what is fitting.

The so-called "great person" is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—within, as strong as Heaven and Earth; without, as bright as the sun and moon. Heaven and Earth cover and bear all without exception; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person displays virtue to the people, neither altering what is constant nor changing what is regular, so that all under Heaven obey his commands as grass follows the wind.

By embracing the Dao and establishing virtue, virtue may be displayed; by following the times and aligning with nature, commands may be enacted. If governance errs in spring, Jupiter waxes and wanes, not abiding in its regular course. If governance errs in summer, Mars moves in retrogression. If governance errs in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its rising and setting irregular. If governance errs in winter, Mercury fails to manifest in its proper region. When governance in all four seasons goes awry, Saturn sways and trembles, the sun and moon show portents, the five planets rebel in disorder, and comets emerge. Only those who cultivate virtue avoid such omens.

When spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish—heavenly timing and human affairs align, thus the qi of harmony and life prevails, and the five grains grow lush. When summer governance is not lost, rain falls in its season. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper and thrive—grains and fruits ripen, and the people naturally abound. When winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being—for winter’s yin is tranquil and still, and governance that follows it brings serenity.

*End of Scroll Two of the* Tongxuan Zhenjing
*Scroll Three of the* Tongxuan Zhenjing

Judge of the Court of Judicial Review, Probationary Officer of the Supreme Court of Law, and Magistrate of Jinyun County in Kuozhou, Zhu Jingzhengyi’s Annotations on the *Nine Guardings*

The *guarding* lies in unifying the will, while the *nine* encompasses the utmost in numerical perfection. Thus, nothing lies beyond its domain, and no affair fails to reach completion. This section, from *Guarding Simplicity* to *Guarding Emptiness*, comprises ten chapters. Each bears the word *guarding* in its title, save one, which conceals it. The number nine is embedded within the text, and though we now speak of the *Nine Guardings*, this refers to the application of the principle of nine.

Laozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, all was dark and indistinct, merged as one—undifferentiated primordial qi. Silent and limpid, the heavy and turbid settled to become earth, while the pure and subtle rose to form heaven. When utmost clarity prevailed, the distinction of light and heavy naturally arose. From this arose the four seasons, and from division emerged yin and yang. Qi, stagnant or restless, gave birth to yin and yang; cycles, with their beginnings and ends, produced the four seasons. Refined qi became humans, while coarse qi became creatures. Thus, humans earned the name of the most numinous, while creatures fell among the multitude. Hardness and softness complement each other, and the myriad things are born. Hardness is the nature of yang; softness, the substance of yin. When these two qi interact and converge, life is sustained.

The spirit originates from heaven, endowed with lightness and clarity to flow freely. The bones and flesh take root in earth, endowed with weight and turbidity to remain grounded. When the spirit enters its gate, the bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? For life and transformation are the constant principles of heaven. In birth, one suddenly becomes form and spirit; in transformation, one silently returns to the root. Coming is not what we esteem, nor is going within our control—so on what basis can the notion of "I" stand? The gate is the path of return and transformation.

Thus, the sage models himself on heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom or swayed by others. He dares not cling to the "I," but instead aligns with nature’s spontaneity. He takes heaven as father and earth as mother, revering the ultimate of spirit and form, and emulating the virtue of their encompassing embrace. Yin and yang serve as the warp, the four seasons as the weft. Without holding to these as the guiding principles, one cannot harmonize with the great order.

Heaven is tranquil and clear; earth is settled and serene. All things that oppose them perish, while those that follow them live. If even heaven and earth rely on stillness to perfect their virtue, how can the creatures they generate seek survival through restlessness? Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. When the spirit is settled and stable, it rests in heaven’s stillness and silence. When the great Dao embodies its essence, it dwells in the heart’s emptiness and nothingness.

The spirit is what we receive from heaven; the bones and flesh, what we inherit from earth. This is what it means to honor the spirit to preserve the form. Thus it is said: The Dao gives birth to the One. The Dao does not generate, nor does the One stand alone. Yet when we observe the state before existence began, we forcibly name it the Dao. When numbers were still merged, we call it the One. The One gives birth to the Two. It splits to become the two qi of yin and yang. The Two gives birth to the Three. Yang, clear, rises to form heaven; yin, congealed, descends to become earth. The two qi harmonize in the center to create humans. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Once the Three Powers are established, the ten thousand transformations can arise, and the myriad kinds renew themselves daily.

The myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their fronts, harmonizing through the balancing qi. Turning away from yin and facing yang is the natural course of life. The balancing of qi is the root of vitality.

Laozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth to be born, taking in qi to transform and give rise to this form and spirit. In the first month, the essence congeals, its appearance like grease. In the second month, the vessels form, as blood and qi channel into pathways. In the third month, the embryo takes shape, though its interior remains unhardened. In the fourth month, the fetus appears, with faint outlines of features. In the fifth month, the sinews develop—halfway through the ten-month gestation. The sinews, firm yet flexible, lie between hardness and softness, so they form at this time.

As essence and blood transform to become bones and flesh, the bones harden and the flesh thickens, obstructing the flow of vital qi. Thus, the flesh conceals the vessels, and the bones connect the sinews, allowing the vital qi to circulate and link the limbs and joints. In the sixth month, the bones form as the essence solidifies. In the seventh month, the fetus is complete, with the five viscera fully developed internally and the nine orifices formed externally. In the eighth month, it moves its limbs. In the ninth month, it becomes restless, as movement reaches its peak. In the tenth month, it is born, its form and bones fully developed, the five viscera now manifest. Inner and outer are each properly aligned.

The liver governs the eyes, the kidneys the ears, the spleen the tongue, the lungs the nose, and the gallbladder the mouth. These assignments may differ from other accounts. Though the five viscera and seven orifices have their designated functions, they are interconnected and responsive in all ways. Thus, the heart is not mentioned here, for as the most numinous of the viscera, its external orifice transcends singular governance.

The outer is the surface; the inner, the core. The four limbs and nine orifices are the surface; the five viscera and six bowels, the core. The head is round to model heaven; the feet are square to resemble earth. Heaven is round and earth square, so their upper and lower parts each follow their kind.

Heaven has four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty-six days. The nine divisions are the nine celestial gates. Humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints—all modeled on what is above. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. Wind disperses, rain bestows—these correspond to taking and giving. Cold governs killing, heat governs harmony—these correspond to joy and anger.

The gallbladder manifests as clouds, symbolizing courage and awe. The lungs manifest as qi, symbolizing purity and brightness. The spleen manifests as wind, symbolizing movement. The kidneys manifest as rain, symbolizing yin’s moisture. The liver manifests as thunder, symbolizing wrathful shaking. Humans and heaven and earth are mutually resonant, with the heart as their master.

The heart governs perception and transformation, akin to the fundamental mechanism of the Ninefold Dao. The remaining viscera and bowels all have their correspondences, and thus the resonance between heaven and humanity is complete. Yet the heart, fundamentally master of the tongue’s single orifice, remains unencumbered by external encasement, free from entanglement—hence its lordship over all.

The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. The eyes mirror the sun, the ears mirror the moon; qi mirrors wind, blood mirrors rain. When the sun and moon deviate from their courses, they suffer obscuration and loss of light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, they bring ruin and calamity. If the sun and moon stray from their proper degrees, they reach conjunction and eclipse; if wind and rain come at the wrong time, the five grains are destroyed. Applied to the body, the consequences are self-evident.

When the five planets stray from their paths, the provinces and states suffer their misfortune. Each of the five planets governs its own celestial region. Heavenly timing and human affairs interact and give rise to phenomena. Thus, when the feudal lords of a state or the governors of a province commit a single moral lapse, the signs appear above, and the realm below suffers the disaster. From this, we know that humanity and heaven-and-earth are mutually resonant.

The ears and eyes are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When qi rebels, wind becomes violent; when blood stagnates, rain lingers. When the ears and eyes lack moderation, the sun and moon stray from their degrees. Such is the nature of things.

The Way of heaven and earth is vast and boundless, yet even it tempers its radiance, cherishing its numinous brightness. How then can human ears and eyes endure endless seeing and hearing without rest, or the spirit gallop without fatigue? Heaven and earth are broad and immeasurable, their limits unfathomable. The sun and moon shine ceaselessly, yet even they suffer the losses of eclipse, moderating their full brilliance. Cold and heat follow their constant cycles, preserving their numinous brightness. How much less can one, confined by the limits of human measure, use them without restraint?

Thus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external. One who excels at guarding the internal is not led astray by externals. Blood and qi are humanity’s splendor—its very countenance. The five viscera are humanity’s essence: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores intention and wisdom, the kidneys store essence and will. All are inwardly stored as essence, outwardly expressed as spirit.

When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires diminish. All manifestations of joy and anger in the countenance, all shifts between courage and timidity in the breath—these are signs of blood and qi straying outward. In this way, loss and gain become self-evident. If blood does not rebel within, the muscles and bones are replete; if qi does not wander without, emotions and desires are few. When the qi of the viscera is insufficient, partial cravings arise to harmonize and regulate—how then can desires persist? When desires diminish, the ears and eyes become clear, and hearing and vision grow keen. Desires arise primarily through the ears and eyes; thus, when they are few, clarity arises naturally. Clarity brings unconfused hearing and unswayed vision—this is called illumination.

When the five viscera remain aligned with the heart without separation, qi and intention prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. The five viscera each have their manifestations, their spirits and qi distinct, yet the heart is the master of the hundred spirits and five viscera. If it can keep them aligned, unheard and unresponsive, then the spirit is whole and qi is focused. Yet if the gallbladder’s courage or the spleen’s arrogance act in rebellion, unrestrained by the heart, how can rectitude be achieved? With hearing that misses nothing, vision that sees all, and the power to accomplish everything—the heart’s full potential is realized in its use.

Calamities find no entry, and pathogenic qi cannot invade. Pathogenic qi assails the center only when there is no master; calamities arise externally when the mechanism is obscured. Thus, when qi is upright, evil cannot invade; when the spirit is whole, fortune arrives manifestly. Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who perceive broadly know narrowly. Only by calming the heart can one govern, and the five viscera reveal themselves—then one knows the world.

The orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; through them, clarity is communicated, and by them, ingress and egress occur. Qi and intention are the messengers and signs of the five viscera. When intention and qi serve as messengers, the five viscera can be observed. Thus, when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sound and color, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, responding as if to an official summons. When blood and qi surge without cease, the spirit gallops unrestrained, and the spirit is burdened by the form.

Though fortune and misfortune arrive like mountains, they cannot be discerned. In stillness, one perceives the subtle; in chaos, one is deluded by the manifest. The sage cherishes and does not transgress—cherishing the form and spirit, not overstepping into sound and color. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, unenticed by external allure, then intention and qi do not lose their clarity and stillness, desires are few, and the five viscera are at peace. When the spirit guards the form within and does not stray, one can observe the external events of past ages and the internal affairs of future matters, and the gates of fortune and misfortune become as nothing. If one truly embodies the virtues described above, then the profound mirror is without obstruction—and how much more so when fortune and misfortune have already taken shape, nothing will escape notice.

By distinguishing categories and naming their relations, by illuminating numbers and their mutual generation, affairs become observable. By cultivating one’s nature to align with the root, by exhausting the spirit to fathom the distant, the past can be traced. The external is the track of what has come before; the internal is the omen of what is to come. The past leaves tracks; by following them, one arrives. What comes from without has not yet taken shape; by attending to its omens, one discerns the internal. Thus, the alternation of mechanisms and their cycles can be known—how then can the gates of fortune and misfortune be worthy of mention?

The farther one extends outward, the less one knows—this speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent. When externally indulgent, it is swept away by others and cannot reflect upon itself. Thus, the five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, rendering them unhearing.

「Hearing mixed sounds brings confusion; the five flavors disorder the palate, causing the mouth to lose its natural sensitivity and thus its true taste. The pursuit of dwelling and avoidance of movement unsettle the heart, leading to erratic conduct—when the mind is disturbed, there is no steadfast purpose. Therefore, indulgence in desires makes one’s *qi* stray, and attachment to likes and dislikes exhausts one’s spirit. Those who do not swiftly abandon them will see their *qi* wasted daily, and how long can such a life endure?

It is because people cannot complete their natural lifespan that they nurture their lives excessively. All follow their cravings and attachments, over-nourishing themselves and thereby harming their vitality. Only those who do not cling to life as their own can attain longevity. Forgetting joy brings contentment; abandoning life preserves the body. The Dao of heaven and earth flows and unites, all things converge into one—*yin* and *yang* *qi* intermingle, thus maintaining harmony. All things spring from a single origin; to know that origin is to know all things. Unable to grasp the One, one knows nothing. Without adhering to the fundamental Dao, all encounters lead to bewilderment.

I dwell within the world as one of its myriad things, yet things remain distinct from me. Born together between heaven and earth, my body is but one among the ten thousand. How can things truly "affect" other things? Only those who share the same essence do not harm each other through opposition. Desire cannot be served, for life arises naturally and cannot be forced. Death cannot be avoided, for time wills it and cannot be defied. To revere the lowly is not to be humble, nor to despise the noble to be virtuous—it is simply following nature’s way. To rest in one’s inherent nature is true ease; to not strain beyond one’s limits is supreme joy. To follow nature’s course without forcing it is to embrace its fullness. What else could be called the ultimate in ease?

To uphold the virtues of tranquility and contentment, to embrace stillness and thus complete one’s days. Adhering to these four virtues, one rides the transformations of nature to their end. Without partiality or favoritism, this is the Dao’s perfection. Clinging to virtue and nurturing harmony, one aligns with heaven’s will. To embrace the virtue of stillness and harmonize with the *qi* of life, thus conforming to nature’s flow.

To dwell at the boundary of the Dao, to neighbor with virtue—those who traverse emptiness in response are at the Dao’s utmost. To govern with harmony is to be surrounded by virtue. To not initiate fortune nor provoke misfortune: fortune is not fortune unless one finds ease in it; misfortune is not misfortune unless one is agitated by it. Those who remain tranquil in misfortune will find their fortune distinct from others; those who cannot find ease in fortune will see it turn to misfortune. The essence of fortune and misfortune lies not in wealth or poverty, but in agitation or stillness.

Moreover, the principle of the beginning is rooted in action: evil arises from reckless movement, and peril lurks in the timing of one’s actions. Thus, the sage acts without forcing, faces neither misfortune nor fortune, and moves effortlessly forward and backward. Though fortune and misfortune may appear externally, the sage remains undisturbed by their ebb and flow, unaffected by life and death. To follow nature’s transformations without resistance is to be ever constant—this is the sage’s unchanging state, beyond birth and death. Hence, it is called *至神* (ultimate subtlety of the spirit).

The spirit seeks without failing, accomplishes without hindrance. Its application knows no limits. To guard emptiness—wandering through all things yet not being bound by them—is to transcend self and object. Laozi says: *"The sage who lightens the world’s burdens is spirit without encumbrance."* When the spirit is vast and balanced, it bears no weight upon the soul’s essence, and thus effortlessly detaches from worldly honors.

To refine all things—when the heart is undisturbed by external objects—is to not be confused. To perceive the great as the autumn hair and the small as the mighty mountain, to dwell equally in vast or narrow realms, abandoning distinctions of size or insignificance, how could one be confused?

To equalize life and death—when the mind is unshaken—is to not fear. For awareness ends with dreams, and dreams with waking. Life and death move and rest, each in its own time, and to align with this way is to safeguard what one fears.

To harmonize with transformation—when one knows that all things share the same essence—is to not be dazzled by heaven’s logic. The ultimate sage stands as an unyielding pillar, traversing paths without obstruction. Virtue is the master that never falters, the Dao ever flows and remains open. Drawing from an inexhaustible source, learning from an unending teacher, the sage fulfills all needs without ever wearying the spirit, or losing the body’s essence. Without action that does not succeed, without response that does not align, bending and extending, rising and falling—embracing fate without confusion, and thus effortlessly navigating fortune and misfortune, while harm and benefit cannot truly disturb.」

To entrust oneself to Heaven’s command, to adapt with the times—when fortune and misfortune come, they cannot truly become inner turmoil.

To act with righteousness (*yì*) is to be constrained by virtue (*rén*), yet not coerced by force.
Those who receive their mandate great of heart, though they tread upon white blades, remain steadfast in their principles.
Show them virtue, and they cannot be forced to act otherwise.
They can be corrected by righteousness, yet not swayed by profit.
Righteousness lies in what is inherently beneficial.
A noble (*junzi*) dies for righteousness, not to be detained by wealth or honor—
as with the likes of Boyi and Shuqi.

To act with righteousness is not to fear death—
as with the case of the Qi minister Chen Buzhan.

How much more so for those of *wuwei*?
To uphold a single principle may yet lead to ruin—
yet with boundless *wuwei*, why burden oneself with form?
The practitioner of *wuwei* bears no encumbrance;
the unburdened one regards the world as a shadow pillar—
a pillar that stands without obstruction.

The ultimate sage does not proclaim himself to the world,
yet all things stand naturally in their place.
Without encumbrance in adaptation, all under heaven flows open and clear.

Observing the conduct of the ultimate sage,
delving deep into the intent of virtue and Dao,
examining the customs of the world—
only then can one truly grasp and elucidate.

To take the world as no burden is the foundation of learning.
All who study seek only to restore their true nature.
To never take the world as burden is what learning cannot yet reach.
If one seeks a child by beating a drum, it proves the child has already gone—
seeking cannot catch what has already passed.

To preserve the natural state,
to abandon what one does—
then the Dao becomes effortlessly smooth.

The Master Laozi said:

To revere power and hoard wealth—these are what people covet.
Yet when compared to the body, they are base.
For the body, what is noble is to preserve its clarity and ease, ensuring tranquility.

The common crowd knows only to elevate themselves through power and enrich themselves with wealth,
yet they fail to recognize that those who dwell in such things
do not fully possess the completeness of ease and tranquility.
Thus, they devalue what they revere while fortifying their foundation.

Therefore, the sage eats only to fill the void and nourish the *qi*,
wears only to cover the form and ward off cold.
When desires are met, the belly is content, the body is at ease—
yet beyond this, it becomes a source of harm to life and essence.
Thus, the sage rejects it.

Not coveting gain, not hoarding excess—
naturally attaining what is right, not what is greedily sought.
Things accumulate by their own nature, not by excessive hoarding.

With clear eyes that do not gaze, still ears that do not listen,
not dominated by sounds and colors, naturally serene and quiet.
With a closed mouth that does not speak, a mind that does not deliberate—
not rashly asserting words, responding only when pressed.
Not preemptively scheming, deciding only when confronted.

Abandoning cleverness, returning to the primordial simplicity—
not fixating on what lies before the ears and eyes,
but aligning with the origin of form and substance.
Resting the spirit, discarding contrivance—
contrivance being artifice—
rest means remaining undistracted externally,
discarding means remaining unperturbed internally.

Without preference or aversion, this is called Great Harmony.
Even application to things makes it harmonious.

To remove filth and burdens, nothing surpasses never departing from the origin.
What need is there for failure?

If one abides here, grasping the essence of the Dao,
then the heart’s impurities are naturally purged,
the heart’s burdens naturally removed,
and peace prevails.

Thus, those who understand the harmony of nurturing life
cannot be swayed by profit.
Profit lies in harmony and goodness—this the nurturer knows.
To cling to profit is to court death’s gain.

Those who harmonize inner and outer cannot be lured by power.
Power is alignment.
If I follow the natural Dao to serve others,
then others’ inherent nature is already within me,
and alignment is achieved—what external power could lure?

The greatest "outside" is boundless, the most noble "inside" is supreme.
To move in and out without obstruction,
to merge mystically with all things—
this is the boundless "outside" and the supreme "inside."

Noble and vast, it cannot be partial—only the Dao suffices.
To know the great and noble, where can one fail?

To guard simplicity is to uphold the natural principle of self-trust,
and thus simplicity is attained.

Laozi said:
The ancients who cultivated the Dao
regulated emotions and nature,
governed the mind and refined technique.

If desires do not exceed proper measure,
then the fullness of nature’s vitality is preserved.
If joy and anger are not reckless,
then the mind’s chaos is rectified.

Nurture with harmony, govern with moderation—
harmony to sustain life, moderation to fulfill desires.
To rejoice in the Dao and forget poverty,
to embrace virtue and forget destitution.

The Dao conquers, so one takes responsibility;
virtue suffices, so one attains richness.
Nature has what it does not desire—
without desire, nothing is lacking.
The self-sufficient always obtain.

The heart has what it does not delight in—
without delight, nothing is forced.
Not delighting in any circumstance,
one can thus become the joy of all under heaven.

What harms nature is not burdened upon virtue.
Desire that does not benefit nature—
virtue is achieved only through stillness.
What harms life is not allowed to disrupt harmony.
Stillness benefits life; harmony arises from desire’s regulation.

To let the body roam freely while observing measure
can serve as a model for all under heaven.
For the greatest virtue is never excessive—
even unrestrained freedom can become a model of sorrow.

To eat according to hunger, clothe according to need,
dwell comfortably, act in accord with nature—
this is the sage’s adherence to simplicity.

To relinquish the world yet not possess it,
to entrust all things yet not exploit them—
how could poverty, wealth, nobility, or lowliness
cause one to lose their true nature and life?

Things have their own essence;
it is unknown whether they fully preserve themselves.
If so, one may be said to embody the Dao.

**Guarding Clarity**
Clarity without obstruction can reflect the delusions of desire.

Laozi said:
What humans receive from Heaven—
the ears and eyes drawn to sounds and colors,
the mouth and nose to fragrances and foul odors,
the skin to cold and warmth—
their nature is the same.

Some die, some live;
some become noble, some become base—
the means of regulation differ.

Life’s essence is uniform in its six adaptations.
If externally one does not overindulge,
and internally one does not violate harmony,
then one’s lifespan is determined by Heaven,
and one’s conduct returns to its natural course.

If sounds and colors disrupt the will,
and extremes of cold and heat assail the body,
then one naturally becomes a companion of death,
a follower of delusion.
Is this not Heaven’s gift turned into human loss,
where regulation fails to suit?

The spirit is the depths of wisdom—
with profound stillness, wisdom’s use is inexhaustible.
Clarity of spirit brings clarity of mind—
if not obscured by things, all actions become discerning.

Wisdom is the reflection of the heart—
where the heart reaches, wisdom follows to unravel it.
Public wisdom mirrors an even heart.
The heart can command, wisdom can strategize;
when empty and responsive, the heart’s rectitude is revealed.

No one mirrors themselves in flowing water,
but in still water—
because it is clear and tranquil.
Not receiving externally makes it clear,
not being disturbed internally makes it still.
Its reflective power is naturally luminous.

Thus, with spirit clear and intent even,
one can discern the nature of all things.
To perceive their nature is the work of a still heart.

Moreover, excessive action leaves omissions,
labor and agitation leave no reflection.
Clear and even as water,
things naturally reveal themselves.

Thus, action arises from what is not forced—
to exhaust with labor is to use without purpose.
To stillness comes clarity as a mirror—
to use without using.

The mirror’s clarity is not sullied by dust—
the spirit’s clarity is not misled by desires.
A clear spirit brings clear wisdom;
clear wisdom does not stray from natural virtue,
and thus there are no burdens.

When the heart reaches its limit,
the spirit is naturally present within.
The heart is direct, the spirit is subtle in its function.

The mind moves where intent directs,
and stills where intent rests.
How could one not be serene and settled?

Returning to emptiness,
dryness and agitation dissolve.
Emptiness is the dwelling of the spirit—
returning to it, one hollows the heart and entrusts it to the spirit,
forgets desires, and attains discernment.

Thus, yin and yang, water and fire,
no longer drag or alter one’s self.
This is the play of the Sage.

The spirit plays with transformation.
Therefore, to govern the world,
one must first grasp the nature of life and fate.

Within the realm of life,
only nature (*xìng*) and fate (*mìng*) exist.
What all share in preserving,
yet differ in kind—
this cannot be reached without the spirit,
nor governed without the great harmony.

To abide in truth,
adjust the form, and find ease—
then ease is without excess;
to follow nature and proceed—
then all actions are genuine.

Yet great names and great masters arise from here.
Laozi said:
*"The so-called Sage adjusts their emotions alone.
They eat to fill their belly,
clothe themselves to suit their form,
moderate themselves—
and thus the hearts of greed and filth have no opportunity to arise.
What one cannot avoid in life is food and clothing.
Measuring the body, filling the belly—
the rest are superfluous things.
But if internally and externally there is no defilement,
they are called Sages.
Thus, those who can possess the world
must not covet the world.
The Sage does not use the world to indulge their desires,
but forgets the world.
Therefore, those who can govern it
are entrusted with its name.

Those who seek great fame and reputation
do not adorn themselves with deceit—
yet petty actions are all deceitful.
If one truly grasps the nature of life and fate,
then benevolence and righteousness follow naturally.
Those who understand life and fate
see their reputation spontaneously manifest as benevolent and righteous deeds.

When the spirit is unobstructed,
the heart carries nothing,
communing freely and effortlessly—
serene, without concern—
internally unburdened, they are empty and open.
Worldly gains cannot entice them—
no greed.
Sounds and colors cannot seduce them—
no attachment.
Persuasive speech cannot deceive them—
no confusion.
The wise cannot manipulate them—
no deception.
The bold cannot frighten them—
no fear.
This is the Way of the True Person,
the purest essence.

Life begets life and does not die,
transformation transforms and does not cease.
The Dao ever endures,
transforming all things—
thus, aligning with Heaven is unseen,
harmonizing with the Way is unfathomable.
Those who do not grasp this Dao,
though their wisdom encompasses Heaven and Earth,
their brilliance rivals the sun and moon,
their eloquence dissolves like gold and stone—
still, they cannot govern the world.
As *Zhuangzi* says:
*"Huizi’s arguments, though intricate, can be unraveled."*
Yet such talents profit nothing in ruling the world.

If one follows Heaven in obscurity,
harmonizes with things in mystery,
then the mechanisms of transformation can be verified,
and the principles of life and fate understood.
Only then, whether at home or in the realm,
does one never fail to act appropriately.

If one relies on clever schemes,
sharp perception,
eloquent persuasion, or moral influence—
these are but partial achievements,
not the complete path to governance.
Thus, the Sage does not abandon their foundation.
They guard the origin of life and transformation,
not relying on sharp perception for governance—
and so the world naturally aligns,
the people say, *"This is effortless."*

To guard stillness—
the Sage finds ease here,
as the root of life and the foundation of virtue.
Laozi said:
*"Serene, tranquil, and undisturbed—
this is how one nourishes life.
Fulfilling one’s natural span,
only then can it be called nourishment.
Harmonious, joyful, and empty—
this is how one establishes virtue.
Receiving things in emptiness,
meeting affairs with harmony—
virtue resides here and is complete.
Externally undisturbed within,
nature finds its proper place—
sounds and colors become discarded things,
nature remains whole.
Internally unmoved and harmonious,
virtue finds its rightful place—
not burdened by affection,
unimpaired in dealing with others—
thus virtue finds its rest in its place.
Nourishing life to sustain the world,
embracing virtue to complete one’s years—
this is to truly embody the Dao."*

When nature is not yet complete,
it is dragged by desires—
and thus cannot govern the world.
When virtue is about to fail,
it is weighed down by things—
and thus cannot complete one’s lifespan.
Yet externally, things assail,
injuring the center and altering nature—
even if one wishes to avoid distress,
how could it be possible?

Thus, serene stillness preserves life,
only then can one venture into action,
harmony and joy then secure the end.
Those who embody the Dao are such.

If so, then blood and vessels flow without obstruction,
the five viscera hold no stagnant *qi*—
form harmonious, nature still—
what ailments could afflict them?

When blood and vessels stagnate,
it is due to insufficient nourishment.
When the five viscera accumulate *qi*,
it stems from excessive joy and anger.
Fortune and misfortune cannot sway them,
praise cannot soil them—
those who disrupt nature and harmony,
who seek fame and fortune,
are those who harm life.
Without their age, who could save them?

This is the Sage’s discourse with the Dao.

The Way of serene stillness is the Sage’s path,
in accord with governance, opposed to chaos—
thus, without a wise ruler,
the self-preserving Way cannot be upheld.

Even if one has talent but lacks the right time,
one’s very life cannot escape peril—
how much less so without the Way!

This is the Sage’s exhortation toward the Way.

Moreover, those with the capacity for office,
yet unfit for the shifting demands of power,
cannot escape the troubles of an age.
How much less so those who do not uphold stillness
and tread upon perilous thresholds!

He who scrutinizes the tip of an autumn hair
cannot hear the thunder of the heavens;
he who attunes to the sound of jade and stone
cannot perceive the form of Tai Mountain—
thus, small things fixated upon,
great things are forgotten.

One indulgence in sensual pleasures,
and the distant reaches of true nature are lost.

Now, all things converge upon us,
plucking our vitality,
consuming our essence—
like springs and wells exhausted.
The allure of sound and color,
from every side, cannot be fully resisted—
thus, even Heaven’s own essence is drained.

Though one might wish to abstain,
how could it be possible?

For these are ever before the ears and eyes.

The water in a basin, if made clear,
takes a day to reveal the brows and lashes;
if muddied, even a moment’s disturbance
makes roundness and squareness invisible.

The mirror of a tranquil mind exists only for those who attain stillness.
Thus, when one is ensnared by desires,
even calamities as vast as mountains
remain unseen.

Human spirit is hard to purify but easily clouded—
like water in a basin.

To uphold the Dao beyond the Dao,
one must model Heaven.
The Dao of modeling Heaven
has no end to what it models,
yet aligns with the Great Harmony.

Laozi said:
*The Supreme Sage models Heaven,*
*The sages of antiquity modeled the patterns of Heaven’s Way,*
*Teaching nothing yet transforming all,*
*Abandoning cleverness yet achieving success.*
*Virtue renews daily,*
*Thus no name can be given to it,*
*Mysterious function leaves no trace—*
*Hence, the power of the Sovereign is unknown.*

The next rank are the superior worthies,
who uphold the Dao of virtue as supreme.
Below them are the appointed ministers—
the path of peril and ruin,
for it is the way of relying solely on one’s own strength.

The superior worthy is the root of delusion,
for the superior worthy brings contention,
and contention is the origin of chaos.

To model Heaven is the Way to govern Heaven and Earth.
To follow the Dao of Nature,
then the Two Principles harmonize in governance.

Emptiness and stillness are the essence—
Heaven’s substance.
Empty and receptive to all,
still and sustaining all,
holding back the tumult of myriad things.

Knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness,
one can complete the beginning and end.
Never suppressing things,
yet letting them reach their own extremes—
like the seasons passing without end.

Thus, the Sage governs through stillness,
and governs through movement as chaos.
Stillness restores each to its true nature and life.

It is said:
*Do not disturb, do not entangle,*
*And all things will naturally clarify.*
*Do not alarm, do not terrify,*
*And all things will naturally order themselves—*
*Such is the Way of Heaven.*

*"Entangle"* means excessive schemes,
*"Terrify"* means imposing harsh decrees.

To uphold weakness,
to dwell in the position where none can rival you—
thus, the Way of great victory is fulfilled.

Laozi says:

When the Son of Heaven, the public lords, and the marquises treat the realm and the world as their own home, and all things as their livestock, harboring the vastness of the world, possessing the abundance of myriad things, then their *qi* becomes dissipated and their wills grow arrogant. This is what is meant by: *"Nobility without arrogance"*—yet arrogance will inevitably arise.

The great will invade the small—such as when Jin annihilated You, or Chu attacked Xing. The small will act haughty and domineer—such as Cao Gong and Wei Xian. Their hearts are extravagant and broad, like a sudden wind or violent rain, unable to endure long.

The *qi* of strength and might—even Heaven and Earth cannot sustain it long, let alone a king who indulges in excess and usurpation. Therefore, the Sage governs with the Dao to restrain them. What else but the Way of emptiness and softness could bring stability?

Holding to One and doing nothing, diminishing the clashing *qi*, balancing the extremes—
Seeing the small and guarding the soft, withdrawing without possession;
Seeing the small yet achieving the great, guarding the soft yet controlling the hard.

Modeling oneself after the rivers and seas—
The rivers and seas do not strive, yet their merit and name naturally manifest.
Those who dwell in lowliness are honored by the multitude;
Their bodies accept counsel, and things accord with them—
Thus, without seeking, their name is fulfilled;
Without contending, their deeds are accomplished.

Not forcing, they achieve kingship.
Those who rely on virtue are at peace; those who rely on force rebel.

As the mother of the world, they preserve their spirit undying—
For the mother is the essence of softness.
The Sage follows this to preserve the spirit.

Self-preservation ensures nobility—
To desire noble status, one must first love one’s body.
Thus, by conquering oneself with the Dao, one’s life may be long preserved.
If the body is preserved, how could nobility perish?

With the power of ten thousand chariots, treating all things as instruments for merit and name—
Merit and name, great or small, are established according to one’s station.
With authority so heavy, one cannot treat oneself lightly.
As *Zhuangzi* says: *"To treat one’s body lightly is to lose one’s state."*

To treat oneself lightly is to fail in merit and name.
There has never been a case where the body is not at ease yet the state is well-governed.

The Dao achieves the great through the small, the many through the few—
The resources of the great are but a single hair’s breadth.
The essence of the many is but a single hairpin’s length.

Thus, the Sage governs the world with the Dao:
The subtle and mysterious are seen as small,
The frugal and diminished are seen as few—
Seeing small, one achieves the great;
Seeing few, one achieves perfection.

The Dao achieves greatness through subtlety and mystery,
Virtue achieves beauty through diminishment and lack.

The Way of Heaven lowers the high and raises the low,
Diminishes the surplus and nourishes the deficient—
Like drawing a bow, where balance is key.
The rivers and seas occupy the world’s deficient places,
Thus all under Heaven return to them and honor them.

Therefore, the Sage maintains humility, modesty, stillness, and yielding—
This is to appear lowly,
To have an empty heart with nothing—
This is to appear deficient.
Following the example of the rivers and seas.

To appear lowly is to attain the high;
To appear deficient is to attract the virtuous.
The heart’s constant humility brings virtue’s ever-greater height;
The body’s constant retreat brings action’s ever-greater progress.

The proud cannot stand, the extravagant cannot endure.
The forceful perish, the overfull are destroyed.
Sudden winds and torrential rains do not last a day;
A shallow valley cannot fill in an instant.
The valley is narrow and confined—
If filled in an instant, it will overflow.
Sudden winds and torrential rains embody forceful *qi*,
Thus they cannot endure and are extinguished.
The shallow valley occupies forceful ground,
Thus it cannot avoid being seized.
Seize their return, honor their virtue.

Therefore, the Sage embraces the feminine and the yielding,
Abandons arrogance and excess,
Dares not act with forceful *qi*,
Following the warnings of Heaven and Earth.

Embracing the feminine, they establish the masculine;
Not daring to be extravagant, they endure long.
Only those who embrace the feminine
Can possess the virtue of standing firm.

Laozi says: *"The Way of Heaven reaches its extreme and reverses,
Fills and then diminishes—*
Like the sun and moon.
At noon, the sun declines;
When the moon is full, it wanes.

Thus, the Sage diminishes daily,
Daring not to be self-satisfied with clashing *qi*,
Advancing daily with the feminine,
Their merit and virtue never decay—
This is the Way of Heaven.

Advancing daily with the feminine means
Pushing softness to govern things.

The Way of Heaven diminishes the full and benefits the humble;
The Sage follows this law.
Thus, perfect virtue renews itself daily without replacement.

Human nature universally desires the high and rejects the low,
Desires gain and rejects loss,
Desires profit and rejects illness,
Desires honor and rejects disgrace,
Desires nobility and rejects lowliness—
All people act this way, yet cannot achieve it.
To grasp it tightly is to fail to obtain it.

Things naturally change and transform;
Their inherent patterns and forces are balanced.
If one waits for completion, success will come.
If one waits for completion, one will fail to obtain it.

Suppose those who hold such positions
Had already determined their proper measure—
Could they, through partial desires and rigid adherence, truly attain it?

Therefore, the Sage follows Heaven:
Achieving without action, obtaining without grasping,
Riding the natural course, thus succeeding with the times,
Gaining with things.

Aligning with people’s emotions yet differing in method,
They endure long.
Aligning in their desired ends,
Differing in their chosen paths,
Reversing their private loves and aversions,
Thus forming the virtue of enduring long.

Hence, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had warning vessels,
Called *yòuzhī*—
When empty, they stand upright;
When full, they overturn.
The details are recorded in *Zhōu Yǔ*.

Things flourish then decline,
The sun reaches its zenith and moves,
The moon is full then wanes,
Joy reaches its peak and sorrow follows.

Therefore, the keen and wise guard with stupidity,
The most discerning have no followers,
Hiding brilliance and blending with the multitude.
The well-read and eloquent guard with frugality,
Boasting of ability brings disgrace,
Holding back without loss.

The martial and courageous guard with caution,
Lightly treating enemies leads to defeat,
Cautiousness preserves victory.

The wealthy and expansive guard with restraint,
Arrogance and excess bring daily peril,
Humility and diminishment bring daily blessings.

Virtue bestowed upon the world is guarded with yielding,
Self-praise leads to ruin,
Promoting others ensures completeness—
These five virtues are how the ancient kings governed the world.

To hold the world is to reach the utmost.
If one clings to extreme desires while holding an extreme position,
Collapse will follow.
Without these five virtues, how could one guard it?

Those who follow this Dao
Do not desire fullness,

The essence lies in harmony within constancy—
Like the disciplined warrior’s tools.

Only by not being full
Does one endure without renewal.
Through humility and emptiness, decay occurs,
Yet this decay nurtures the renewal of virtue and power.

Laozi said:
*The Sage closes with the yin and opens with the yang—*
This is called the Great Harmony.

To reach the point of no delight
Is to attain the state of no discontent.
Neither approval nor disapproval,
Then constancy is achieved.

Without delight, there is eternal delight.
Without delight, the utmost delight is attained.
Where delight resides, sorrow follows—
Only those who forget their delight
Need no prompting to reach its peak.

Thus, inner delight transcends the external,
Not relying on external delight to fill the inner.
Inner delight transcends—
I am unrestrained beyond things;
Delight within—
Things conform to me,
And thus, even in loss, there is gain.

To possess self-delight is to possess self-will,
To be nobly above all things,
Unseen yet sovereign—
This is true nobility.

The reason for this is:
To govern the world by becoming its essential core,
Not in others, but in oneself,
Not in people, but in the body.
When the body is attained, all things are complete.

Those who attain themselves
Bring harmony to heaven, earth, and all things.
Thus, those who master the arts of the heart
Transcend external desires and aversions,
Abandoning all as discarded things.

Therefore, there is no joy, no anger,
No delight, no suffering—
All things merge in the Mysterious Unity,
Neither affirmation nor negation.
Judgment arises from love and hatred;
When the heart is empty, things naturally merge in the Mysterious Unity.
Thus, one does not know how to abandon,
And all distinctions are exhausted.

Therefore, the scholar has fixed principles,
The sage has unchanging conduct—
Though not forgetting their essence,
They attain self-contentment and self-Dao.

They do not rely on power to be honored,
Nor on wealth to be rich,
Nor on strength to prevail.
They do not covet goods or power,
Nor crave fame or status,
Nor take nobility as security,
Nor lowliness as peril.
If one’s place is fixed,
What need is there for external support?

Form, spirit, qi, and will
Each reside in their proper place.
The four coexist,
And the path of harmony
Thus avoids contradiction.

Even the scholar’s and sage’s moral integrity
Can be thus—
How much more so for the Sage of complete virtue?

The body is the dwelling of life,
Residing in the form.
Qi is the origin of life,
Rooted in essence.
The spirit is the governor of life,
By governance in the spirit.
If one loses its place,
The three are harmed.
If one loses the proper nourishment of its place,
All are harmed together.

Thus, those who take the spirit as master
Find the form benefiting accordingly—
Governed so as not to transgress,
Hence its benefit.
Those who take the form as governor
Harm the spirit.
Indulging in excess, overfeeding,
Harms the spirit.
The greedy, gluttonous, and desirous
Are blinded by power and wealth,
Tempted by fame and status—
Though their intelligence surpasses others,
Their spirit weakens with time,
Lost in excess without return.
The body becomes rigid, the center blocked—
No passage remains.

Rigidity of the form is closure,
Lack of harmonious qi is obstruction.
Thus, there are times of blindness and forgetfulness,
Self-loss.

External allure and internal depletion
Over time lead to obscurity.
Going forth without knowing the way back,
They suffer the affliction of blindness and forgetfulness.

Spirit and will—
When still, they grow daily stronger;
When agitated, they weaken daily, aging.
A full spirit encompasses all things—
This is due to stillness.
A constrained form falters—
This is due to movement.
How can one neglect the rhythms of flourishing and decline?

Thus, the Sage nurtures the spirit,
Harmonizes and weakens the qi,
Balances and levels the form,
And floats with the Dao.
Though things come and go,
All conform to the Dao.

Thus, the transformations of all things
Are without exception,
And all affairs
Are without resistance.
In harmony with what is transformed,
In accord with what changes.

To guard simplicity—
Not adding desire to the nature of life,
Yet encompassing the roots of transformation—
This is called simplicity.

Laozi said:
*The True Person*
Is one whose nature aligns with the Dao—
Not acting of oneself,
Yet in accord with the transformations of the world.

Thus, having yet appearing as nonexistent,
Substantial yet appearing as empty—
Though all things are real,
The true nature knows no abode.

Cultivating the inner without governing the outer—
There has never been one who governs the inner yet desires the outer.

Clarifying the Great Primordial,
Without action, returning to simplicity—
For without action, simplicity is achieved,
Then the virtuous in truth
Move and rest within the realm of emptiness and whiteness.

Embodying the origin, embracing the spirit,
Roaming the roots of heaven and earth—
Embodying the essence of primordial qi,
Embracing the spirit of transformation,
Residing before all things.

Vague and unassuming beyond dust and filth,
Adrift in the business of nothingness,
Separate from defilement,
Taking non-action as constancy.

Mechanical cleverness is not borne in mind,
Examined for flaws, unchanging with things—
*Examined* is also *abandoned*.
Not borne in mind, what flaws remain?
Then, as things move of themselves,
Why follow along?

Consider this:
Things are but a moment’s dwelling.
What was not is not now—
Logic prevents transformation.
Yet those who judge the world,
Who fixate on doctrine,
Still uphold their forms,
No longer following folly.
How much more so for those whose nature aligns with the Dao,
Drawn along effortlessly?

Seeing the transformations of things,
Yet guarding their origin—
This is called not conforming to things.

The heart and intention are focused inward,
Communing with the One through penetration—
Qi unified, unadulterated,
Penetrating yet unchanging.

Dwelling without knowing action,
Moving without knowing direction—
Without action, without cause.
Not learning yet knowing,
Not seeing yet perceiving—
In harmony with things, yet self-revealing.
Without doing, yet accomplished,
Without governing, yet discerning.
Following the world yet self-fulfilled,
Conforming to kinds yet self-distinguished.

Responding yet not compelled,
Acting yet not forced,
Moving only when unavoidable—

The Way/Dao is never first to begin.
Like light’s radiance, like shadow’s reflection,
A body of purity—clear yet illuminating,
Empty yet responsive.

Following the Dao as its measure,
Yet awaiting the natural unfolding—
To follow is to await;
This is but metaphorical speech.

Vast and empty within,
Clear and still without,
This is its true essence.

Taking myriad births as one transformation,
Countless differences as one origin—
To dwell in the origin is to align with it.

Qi refined yet unused,
Spirit potent yet not employed—
Unused yet aligned, this is called supreme refinement.
Unmoving yet penetrating, this is called supreme spirit.

Standing within the primordial Great Unity,
Firm in the center of supreme refinement—
Sleeping without dreams,
No fancies in mind.

Knowledge does not stir,
It does not precede things;
Movement is formless—
The traces of mysterious response are unseen.

Stillness is without substance,
Not resting upon something to establish stillness.
Existing yet as if nonexistent,
Living yet as if dead—
Not clinging to life or death,
Yet not without the marvelous use of spirit.

Entering and exiting without obstruction,
No hindrance to gold or stone.
Commanding ghosts and gods—
This is but the merging of spirit with emptiness.

Thus, the spirit can ascend to the Dao’s realm:
With virtue/power above, one may attain the supreme Dao?

To let the spirit flow freely,
Yet not stray from its source—
This is called recovering the essence of one’s nature.

Day and night without pause,
In harmony with things like spring’s breath,
Qi meeting all things without gap or breath.
This is the merging of times and life within the heart.

The heart does not generate itself;
It merges with times and thus generates.
Hence, form may fade while spirit never transforms—
Form aligns with things, so it transforms;
Spirit aligns with the Dao, so it endures.

With unchanging essence responding to change,
Endless transformations without cessation—
Fire and water’s functions cannot self-regulate,
Their kind is transformed yet cannot transform things;
The untransformed alone can transform.

With an unchanging essence transforming boundless things,
Thus it cannot be exhausted.

Transformation returns to the formless—
Things born each return to their root.
The untransformed arises with heaven and earth—
The Dao precedes the forms,
So the ever-arising never dies,
Its arising is death itself;
The transformer never transforms,
Its transformation is the thing itself.

The meaning has already been revealed above.
This is the true person’s play,
The pure Dao’s essence.

**End of Scroll Three of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Scripture of Unified Mysterious Truth)**
**Begin Scroll Four of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* (Scripture of Unified Mysterious Truth)**

**符言篇**

*符* is *contract*—*speech* is *principle*.
Thus, through speech’s subtle contract with principle,
One awakens to the Dao’s mystery beyond words—
This is the true accord.

Laozi says:
The Dao is supremely high, without surpassing;
Supremely deep, without descending.
Above, it transcends the highest;
Below, it descends to the lowest.
Thus it can be high and deep,
Ascend and descend.

Level as the plumb-line, straight as the square,
Not because the balance makes it level—
Everywhere it is even.
Not because the square makes it straight—
Everywhere it is true.

Round as the compass, square as the set-square,
Yet not round by being round—no roundness,
Not square by being square—no squareness.
It enfolds heaven and earth yet has no surface or depth,
Its vastness knows no outside, its subtlety no inside.
Piercing like a hollow dome, yet unimpeded,
Great circle without bounds, great passage without obstruction.

Thus those who embody the Dao:
Neither angry nor joyful,
Their sitting free of care, their sleep without dreams,
They name things as they see them, respond as events arise.
This was explained earlier.

Laozi says:
Those who crave fame as a corpse must create affairs,
And affairs, once born, abandon the public for the private.
Those who seek fame as lords must have affairs,
And affairs, once born, breed discord—
Thus one must abandon fame and return to the public.

To double the Dao and burden oneself,
To court praise and do good,
To establish a name and be deemed virtuous—
*Double* means *betray*.
Betraying the Dao to seek praise is not true goodness.
Chasing convention to gain a name is not true virtue.

Governance that defies principle brings many reproaches,
Actions that defy the times yield no merit.
To follow principle is to act with few concerns yet achieve great deeds;
To defy the times is to labor much yet see little fruit.
Falsely scheming for advantage—
When success fails to justify the effort,
When failure brings ruin—
Those who seek praise and immediate effect,
Who curry favor with the times—
Their unfinished works bring ruin upon themselves.

Laozi says:
Do not be a corpse for fame,
Do not be a treasury for schemes,
Do not be a burden for affairs,
Do not be a master of cleverness.
Hide in the formless, act without weariness,
Do not precede fortune, do not initiate calamity.
Move without being the master—then no form;
No form, then no fortune to welcome or ward off.
Respond as it is sung—then no weariness;
No weariness, then no future calamity.

Begin in the formless, act only when unavoidable.
To seek fortune first is to invite calamity;
To seek profit first is to court harm.
To govern before signs appear is to ensure fortune;
To cut off extraordinary gain is to avoid harm.

Thus those who act without doing—
If they lose their tranquility, they are in peril;
Those who govern without doing—
If they lose their order, they bring chaos.
To lose tranquility means to abandon inner peace for outer seeking—
Then rigidity ensues.
To lose order means to forsake self to govern others—
Then confusion follows.

Thus one should not be polished like jade,
Nor rigid like stone.
For jade and stone, once divided, spawn contention.
The finer the carving, the sharper the blade;
The finer the horn, the deadlier the strike.
Sweet springs run dry, straight trees are felled.
Things of beauty invite harm,
Men who court fame invite disaster.
Flowery words bring later regret—
First to flatter with eloquence,
Then to invite ruin upon oneself.
Stone may wound the mountain that hides it—
Mountains that do not conceal treasure are soon stripped bare,
Men who do not guard their words soon invite calamity.
The peril of silence lies in speech itself.

Earlier, the common folk suffered calamity
Because of their reckless debates on state laws and rites.

Moreover, the virtuous are warned thrice to hold their tongues,
While the petty chatter—
How could they avoid disaster?

Laozi says:
To act in accord with the times,
Move by following—
The unknowing turn fortune to calamity.
To follow the times,
Move by acting—
The unknowing lose fortune through it.

The sage’s governance:
Knowing beforehand life and death,
Measuring gains and losses,
Thus opening and closing doors with precision,
Unshaken by honor or disgrace,
Only then does one attain enduring safety and preserve the self.

As for the ignorant,
They often enjoy fortune then wield power,
Thus when fortune peaks, calamity arises.
It is not that fortune and calamity oppose each other—
Rather, their use is misaligned.

Heaven as a canopy, earth as a pivot—
Those who wield the Dao skillfully
Are never exhausted.
Earth as pivot, heaven as canopy—
Those who wield the Dao skillfully
Are never harmed.
To employ the five phases is to know their victories—
Metal and fire attack each other,
And declining kings rise in succession.

What heaven covers is never unsuited—
The Dao’s embrace is all-encompassing.

「Thus, the knowing of the unknown is virtue; the knowing of the known is a flaw.
The knowing of the unknowing is beneficial, the knowing of the strong knowing is flawed.
Laozi says: Mountains produce gold, stones produce jade—
Yet they destroy each other in return;
Wood breeds insects that devour it,
Humans create affairs that betray them.
When fame is sought, the Dao is lost;
When schemes arise, harm is born.

Those who delight in matters never fail to be entangled,
Those who vie for profit never fail to be exhausted.
There is no crossing water without wetting one’s feet,
No passing through dust without staining one’s body.
Skilled swimmers drown, skilled riders fall—
Each meets ruin through their own pursuits.

Boast of one’s abilities and lose one’s merit,
Exploit one’s talents and lose one’s life.
Success lies in timing, not in strife,
Governance lies in the Dao, not in the sage.
Timing brings success without forced contention,
The Dao thrives in self-respect—why seek the sage’s praise?

Earth rests low yet does not contend for height,
So it remains secure without peril.
Water flows downward yet does not vie for speed,
So it departs without delay.
What the Dao values, what virtue esteems,
Is height without contention, speed without haste.

Thus, the sage holds nothing and loses nothing,
Acts without contrivance and meets no defeat.
The Dao is formless, elusive—
To grasp it is to lose it.
It is not a physical body,
Difficult to carve or shape—
Yet to force it is to invite ruin.

Laozi says: One word cannot be exhausted,
Two words make the world follow,
Three words command the feudal lords,
Four words sway the world.
Fidelity brings exhaustion’s end,
Virtue makes the world submit,
Promoting worthy virtue—
The feudal lords rise in power,
Loving the few while cherishing the many—
The world unites in harmony.
He who masters all four words
Ascends to emperorship,
He who gains but one
Descends to conquest or aid.

Laozi says: Humans have three deaths,
Not by fate alone.
Excess in eating and drinking
Diminishes the body—
Illness claims it;
Unchecked joy in gain
Pursues it endlessly—
Punishment claims it;
With few opposing many,
With weak defying the strong—
War claims it.
Thus, life and death depend on oneself,
Calamity and fortune have no fixed gate.
They do not descend from heaven,
But arise from human competition.

Laozi says: The greater the giving, the fairer the return,
The greater the grudge, the deeper the ruin.
Sparse giving yet high expectations,
Nurturing resentment yet hoping for no harm—
Such things do not exist.
Observe how one proceeds,
And one knows how they will return.
High merit brings rich reward,
Deep grudge invites great retribution.
Follow their weight—
Leave behind both debt and grace.

Laozi says: Trace the heavenly command,
Refine the heart’s art,
Balance likes and dislikes,
Align with nature’s flow—
And the Dao’s governance is complete.
Trace the heavenly command,
And one is undisturbed by fortune’s shift.
Refine the heart’s art,
And one does not err in joy or wrath.
Balance likes and dislikes,
And one does not greedily grasp the vain.
Align with nature’s flow,
And one’s desires do not exceed their bounds.
Undisturbed by fortune’s shift,
And one’s actions follow the natural order.
No erring in joy or wrath,
And one’s rewards and punishments are impartial.
Not greedily grasping the vain,
And one’s desires do not harm one’s nature.
Desires not exceeding their bounds,
And one knows how to nurture life with contentment.

These four principles,
Seek not from others, nor borrow from men,
But return within oneself to find.
Understanding these four,
One may call it great harmony.
Not relying on others,
Only self-refinement suffices.

Laozi says: Do not seek the blame of others,
Nor hate those who blame you.
Avoid deceitful actions,
And why would others blame you?
Hold within you compassion and forgiveness,
And you will have no cause to reproach others.
Cultivate the virtue of good reputation,
And do not seek others’ praise for yourself.
Refine your own virtue,
And do not seek others’ praise.
If you cannot prevent calamity from coming,
Trust in your own non-invitation of it.
If you cannot ensure fortune will arrive,
Trust in your own non-rejection of it.
If you cannot guard against unforeseen calamity,
Trust in fate’s unerring course.
If you cannot demand that certain fortune will come,
Receive what comes as it should.
When calamity arrives, it is not your own creation—
So even in ruin, why lament?
When fortune comes, it is not your own doing—
So even in gain, why rely?

Thus, dwell in ease and find joy in the heart,
Govern without contrivance.
Serene, content, and at leisure—
This is all.

Laozi says: The Daoist guards what they already possess,
And does not seek what they have not obtained.
Seeking what they have not obtained,
They lose what they already possess;
Clinging to what they possess,
They gain what they truly desire.
What they already possess is the spirit of their body,
What they lack are myriad external skills.
Now, abandoning the spirit of their body,
They pray for skills they have not yet attained.
The unattained may come,
But the spirit they once held is already forgotten.
Not safeguarding the path to one gain,
It is hard to regret the loss of two.
Thus, the perfect one guards their root,
And does not chase after superficial ends;
They value what is within,
And do not control what is without.

If governance is not yet firmly established in avoiding chaos,
Then those who strive for governance will surely perish.
If conduct cannot yet escape blame,
Then those who rush for fame will surely falter.
Root firm, the state is at peace,
Actions aligned, no shame is incurred.

Thus, no fortune is greater than avoiding calamity,
No profit is greater than not losing.
Fortune without calamity—
Fortune is indeed great.
Profit without loss—
Profit is indeed vast.

Thus, things may bring gain through loss,
Or loss through gain.
Only without calamity or fortune,
Is there no loss or gain.

The Dao cannot be coerced for profit,
Yet it can bring tranquility and avoid harm.
The Daoist cannot be lured by profit,
For without profit, there is no harm.
Thus, the spirit finds peace,
And the Dao comes naturally.
Thus, one who does not taste calamity will not taste fortune,
One who does not commit wrong will not earn merit.
Without calamity or fortune,
Without wrong or merit—
This is called great harmony.

The Dao says: Vague and obscure,
Following heaven’s majesty,
Harmonizing with heaven’s *qi*,
Without thought or planning,
The Dao says: The Dao is sovereign,
Vague and obscure—
The Dao’s depths are unfathomable, unseen.»

The present merely follows Heaven’s Way with emptiness,
For the body with non-action,
For the mind with no deliberation, thus complete—
Without labor, things accumulate naturally.

What comes is not welcomed,
What departs is not detained—
Let it be as it finds itself.
Though people move east, west, south, or north,
They stand alone at the center,
Their bodies respond to things yet endless,
The Dao abides within yet moves alone.

Thus, amid crookedness, they do not lose their straightness,
Their fullness lies in their bending.
Flowing with the world yet never straying from their domain,
The vital *qi* circulates and the true essence remains.

They do not seek virtue,
Nor shun ugliness—
They follow Heaven’s Dao,
Not initiating, not clinging to self,
They follow Heaven’s principle,
Not premeditating, not neglecting the moment,
They align with Heaven’s timing—
Not seeking gain, not rejecting fortune,
They conform to Heaven’s natural order.

Heaven has no mind,
Yet speaks not and all things arise;
Humans act without contrivance,
Yet plan not and all affairs succeed.
Within, no strange fortune,
Without, no strange calamity—
Thus, calamity and fortune do not arise,
And who would be a thief to others?

All who have fortune also have calamity,
Now that calamity and fortune are merged in obscurity,
Who would harm others?
Thus, supreme virtue:
Words align with the Way,
Actions align with fortune,
Hearts unite above and below,
No divergent paths—
Those with partial views advance or retreat in error,
Yet open the Way to virtue,
And the people turn toward it.

Partial views are insufficient to transform customs,
Yet the right Way can guide the people.
Laozi says:
To do good is to exhort,
To do evil is to observe—
Exhorting breeds blame,
Observing breeds affliction.
Exhortation is encouragement,
Observation is scrutiny.
When humans do good,
They should daily encourage themselves.
When there are evils,
They see their own faults and correct them,
Thus turning toward the right—
This is not encouraging others to do good.
If one takes themselves as good,
And scrutinizes others’ evils to blame them,
Then affliction arises.
Thus, exhorting to do good is itself not good.
Hence, the Way cannot be advanced to seek fame,
Nor can it be retreated to cultivate the self.

Thus, the Sage does not act to seek fame,
Nor does they use knowledge to seek praise—
Governance follows nature,
They contribute nothing of their own.
Advancing without embellishing wisdom to seek fame,
Retreating to cultivate the self to govern themselves,
Pushing through naturally—
How could they exhaust others’ praise?

The doer has what may not be completed,
The seeker has what may not be obtained—
Humans have limits, yet the Dao is unobstructed.
Humans seek yet do not obtain,
The Dao acts not yet encompasses all.
Wisdom without action,
Like lack of wisdom, yields equal results—
Ability without exertion,
Like lack of ability, yields equal merit.
Wisdom as if without wisdom,
Ability as if without ability—
The Way is realized while human talents fade.

When *virtue/power* fills within,
Human talents fade externally—
Thus, they have as if they lack,
And reality as if it were void.
Humans and the Dao cannot both be clear,
Humans who love fame cannot use the Dao,
The Dao surpassing humans, fame ceases—
Fame flourishes with humans, yet perishes with them.

The Dao must be unified,
Affairs cannot be fully dual.
Laozi says:
To make the faithful divide wealth,
Not knowing their fixed share yet probing the tally—
Why so?
The scheming mind of the faithful,
Is not as good as the mindless.
To make the virtuous guard wealth,
Is not as good as sealing the doors and keeping it whole—
For the desiring mind of the virtuous,
Is not as good as the desireless.
Probing the tally ends doubt with the mindless,
The virtuous see suspicion in the desiring.
Humans highlight their flaws, then harbor resentment,
Yet mirrors reveal their ugliness and they take pride in it.
The wise point out faults to prompt change,
The foolish adorn themselves and claim virtue.
Humans can receive things without appropriating them,
Thus free from burdens.
Prioritize others, then yourself—
A lifetime without fault.

Laozi says:
All who deal with others,
Either use treasures to corrupt,
Or humble words to ensnare—
Corruption is single, yet desires are insatiable.
The noble do not hoard treasures,
But use gifts and attire with humility and respect—
If others can act in accordance with one principle,
Long-term, they will not grow weary.
Humble bearing avoids reproach,
Persuasion without binding oaths—
Yet alliances and pacts,
Made with fixed terms yet broken before their time,
Are the way of the petty.
The noble’s exchange,
Requires no oaths or agreements—
A single word suffices,
A lifetime unaltered.

Thus, the noble do not externally adorn *virtue/power* and righteousness,
Nor internally cultivate false Daoist arts—
Internally, they hold true sincerity,
Externally, they display no hollow pretense.
They govern affairs within their domain,
Expand their territory’s breadth,
Strengthen their people’s loyalty unto death,
Fortify their cities and walls—
Hearts united above and below,
They defend the state together.
Thus, those who seek fame do not boast of meritless deeds,
Those who seek profit do not attack what is hard to obtain—
This is the Way that must be preserved whole,
The principle that must be advantageous.
Sharing profit with the people,
They gladly die for them.
Uniting hearts with the people,
They guard the state together.
Seekers of fame do not greedily overreach,
Seekers of profit do not arbitrarily divide—
This is the Way that must be preserved whole,
Thus the state is jointly defended,
And borders are firmly secured.

Laozi says:
The Sage does not conquer their own mind,
The common people do not conquer their own desires.
The mind conquers, the Way is whole,
Desires conquer, the body is in peril.
The noble act with upright *qi*,
The petty act with corrupt *qi*—
Internally, it suits their nature,
Externally, it aligns with righteousness—
They move according to principle,
And do not clash with things—
This is the harmony of one *qi*.
Indulging in flavors,
Excess in sounds and colors,
Outbursts of joy and anger,
Without regard for future consequences—
This is corrupt *qi*.
Corrupt and upright injure each other,
Desires and nature harm each other—
They cannot coexist,
One arises, the other declines—
Thus, the Sage diminishes desires and follows nature.

The eyes love colors,
The ears love sounds,
The nose loves fragrances,
The mouth loves flavors—
Alluring them together,
They never stray from desires for profit and harm.
Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth,
Ignoring what they truly desire,
All are controlled by the mind—
Each finds its place—
From this, it is clear that desires cannot be conquered.

The six senses’ desires,
Are all governed by one mind.
*Qi* upright within,
Then desires do not harm nature.
The mind weakened externally,
Then falsehood deceives the true self.

Thus, one knows that weakening and uprightness lie within,
And gain or loss depend on the mind.

「Yet when the heart itself remains upright,
Why should the myriad things weigh upon it?

Laozi says:
*"Those who govern the body and nurture their nature*
*restrict their sleep and dwellings,*
*moderate their food and drink,*
*harmonize their joys and angers,*
*adapt to movement and stillness,*
*find fulfillment within themselves,*
*and speak without external seeking.*
*Thus, perverse qi finds no entry,*
*but adornment of the exterior harms the interior,*
*and bolstering one’s emotions damages one’s spirit.*
*Those who see its form are blinded to its truth.*

*He who forgets his virtue for even a moment,*
*will surely constrain his nature.*
*Laozi says: "A virtuous person cannot forget his virtue,*
*for even a moment’s departure*
*will bring suffering and humiliation."*

*He who forgets his beauty within a hundred paces,*
*will surely burden his form.*

*"To support the body and command the nature,*
*one must properly moderate consumption*
*and preserve harmony,*
*so that inner qi may remain balanced*
*and the spirit may be preserved.*

*The gentleman guards the subtle—*
*not in distant things,*
*but even within ten steps,*
*he considers the peril of decaying logs;*
*in the blink of an eye,*
*an unintended misstep may occur.*
*How can one afford such negligence?*

*Thus, those whose feathers and wings are splendid*
*risk harm to their bones and flesh,*
*and those whose branches and leaves flourish*
*endanger their roots and stems.*
*None in the world can possess both beauties.*

*The jade phoenix is harmed by its very colors,*
*and the spring blossom is broken by its very fragrance.*
*Things may have dual beauties,*
*but affairs cannot be fully reconciled—*
*such is not found.

Laozi says:
*"Heaven has brightness,*
*yet does not worry over the people’s darkness,*
*Earth has wealth,*
*yet does not worry over the people’s poverty.*
*The Dao of Heaven,*
*illuminates the vast and the obscure,*
*penetrating even the deepest depths.*
*The Earth’s abundance,*
*permeates all things,*
*extending boundless aid to all."*

*One who embodies the utmost virtue and the Dao*
*stands firm as a mountain,*
*unmoved—*
*the acting take him as their model,*
*he remains true to himself,*
*sufficient unto all things,*
*yet does not accept gifts from others,*
*nor do those who use him claim his virtue,*
*thus he remains stable and enduring,*
*Heaven and Earth cannot surpass him,*
*thus he suffers no loss,*
*no virtue is claimed,*
*thus no resentment arises.*

*The supreme person*
*is unaffected by external influence,*
*cannot be toppled by desires and harm,*
*stands alone like a mountain,*
*unshaken—*
*with his constant sufficiency,*
*he does not accept gifts or favors,*
*and when he takes what is his,*
*he does not apologize.*

*Thus, if one gives to him, it cannot be retained,*
*and if one takes from him, there is no grievance,*
*so he is able to endure forever.*

*Those skilled in anger invite many resentments,*
*those skilled in giving invite taking.*
*Only by following Heaven and Earth’s natural spontaneity*
*can one master the principles of life.*

*Beyond the realm of joy and anger,*
*forgetting the emotions of giving and taking,*
*letting things unfold naturally,*
*one preserves the fullness of Heaven’s Dao.*

*Thus, praise appears, and blame follows,*
*kindness appears, and cruelty follows,*
*benefit becomes harm,*
*and fortune becomes disaster—*
*if one does not seek benefit,*
*then there is no harm,*
*if one does not seek fortune,*
*then there is no disaster.*
*Preserve the body whole as one’s constant,*
*for wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.*

*Praise is what others admire and covet.*
*Yet if one does not wish to display it,*
*display invites both blame and resentment.*
*It is not that one must utterly abandon virtue,*
*but rather that without arrogance or self-aggrandizement,*
*one naturally avoids both misfortune and fortune,*
*and virtue and the Dao remain intact.*
*Preserve the body whole as one’s constant,*
*for wealth and honor are but transient lodgings.*

Laozi says:
*"The Sage wears no strange or ostentatious garments,*
*nor performs eccentric or bizarre actions.*
*His attire is simple, his conduct unadorned,*
*his garments do not startle the masses,*
*his actions do not deviate from the common way.*
*He is open yet not showy,*
*humble yet not intimidated,*
*honored yet not ostentatious,*
*obscure yet not confined,*
*unique yet not contrary.*
*Open and humble are his fate,*
*thus he is neither showy nor intimidated.*
*Honored and obscure are the times,*
*thus he is neither flaunted nor humiliated.*
*Though he differs from others,*
*what is there to find strange in that?*
*His use is universal,*
*yet cannot be named—*
*this is called the Great Harmony.*

*When there is no use,*
*there is no obstruction—*
*this is the Great Harmony.*

Laozi says:
*"The Dao is to be true to oneself*
*and await one’s fate.*
*When time arrives,*
*one cannot force it forward,*
*when time departs,*
*one cannot chase it backward.*
*Thus the Sage does not advance to seek,*
*nor retreat to yield.*

*Upright in body, awaiting fate,*
*following the Dao in truth,*
*not leading nor following—*
*within three years, time arrives,*
*and I go with it;*
*within three years, time departs,*
*and I remain behind.*
*No going, no coming,*
*balanced in its place.*

*This speaks of the excess of hastening forward*
*and the deficiency of lagging behind—*
*only by meeting time can one have no past,*
*and by following it can one have no future,*
*standing independent within,*
*and finding peace in one’s place.*

*The Dao of Heaven favors none,*
*it bestows only upon virtue.*
*When fortune comes,*
*it is not what one sought,*
*so one does not claim its merit.*
*When disaster arrives,*
*it is not what one created,*
*so one does not regret one’s actions.*
*This has already been explained.*

*Let the heart be serene,*
*and do not burden one’s virtue,*
*for then neither praise nor blame can soil it,*
*nor can honor or humiliation disturb it.*
*Dogs bark, yet it does not startle—*
*self-trusting in one’s nature,*
*truly without transgression.*
*Self-illuminating, without fault,*
*thus no fear nor dread.*

*Thus, those who understand the Dao are not confused,*
*and those who know fate are not anxious.*
*To know the Dao and know fate,*
*what anxiety or fear remains?*

*When the sovereign dies,*
*his remains are buried in the wild,*
*yet his spirit is enshrined in the Hall of Light—*
*the spirit is nobler than the form.*
*It is said that ancient sovereigns*
*returned their remains to the wild,*
*neither sealed nor planted,*
*to show the people that all must end;*
*enshrining the spirit in the Hall of Light,*
*without flattery nor excess,*
*to show the people that reverence must be known.*

*Thus, when the spirit governs the form,*
*it prospers,*
*but when the form overpowers the spirit,*
*it falters.*
*Though wisdom and insight are employed,*
*they must ultimately return to the spirit—*
*this is called the Great Harmony.*

*Rely on the spirit to preserve the form,*
*indulge desire and the spirit will fade,*
*yet none but the enlightened*
*can guard it thus.*

Laozi says:
*"The ancients who preserved themselves*
*rejoiced in virtue and forgot disgrace,*
*thus their names did not sway their resolve,*
*rejoiced in the Dao and forgot poverty,*
*thus benefit did not sway their hearts.*
*Hence they could be humble and yet joyful,*
*quiet and yet unperturbed.*

*Virtue and the Dao complete the body,*
*poverty and disgrace bring no shame,*
*the heart and resolve remain unbroken,*
*names and benefits cause no confusion.*
*Thus they could find joy in humility,*
*and remain tranquil in stillness.*

*With few concerns, they gathered their years,*
*yet they worried over the world’s disorder,*
*as one might worry over the drying of the Yellow River,*
*weeping to increase its flow.*
*Thus, they did not worry over the world’s disorder,*
*but rejoiced in the harmony of their own lives—*
*such can speak of the Dao.*

*It is folly to teach others*
*not to fear the end of their years,*
*yet to fear the world’s disorder,*
*as if one could add but a few drops of tears*
*to swell the vast river’s current—*
*useless indeed.»

「Only those who forget the governance of others and focus on governing themselves can truly speak of the Dao.

Laozi said: *"People have three grievances: those with high rank are envied by others, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with abundant wealth are resented by the people."* Yet, if one can be humble despite high rank, generous despite great wealth, they preserve their innate good fortune. For when rank grows ever higher, their intentions become ever lower; when office expands ever greater, their heart grows ever smaller; when wealth thickens ever more, their giving becomes ever broader. Cultivating these three virtues, resentment will not arise.

Thus, nobility finds its foundation in humility, and height finds its base in lowliness. If these two are not cultivated, calamity will fall upon oneself.

Laozi said: *"Speech is the means by which one conveys themselves to others, and hearing is the means by which others convey themselves to one."* Expressing one’s own sentiments to reach others’ hearts, and grasping others’ intentions to align with one’s own. If one is both deaf and blind, the Dao cannot pass through them. Therefore, those afflicted with deafness and blindness—whether of body or of mind—cannot know the way of harmony. The eyes that fail to see the great mountains, the ears that do not hear the thunderous peals, are the deafness and blindness of the flesh. But those who mistake a mirror for a deer or a horse, whose wisdom is clouded by beans and grains, are the deafness and blindness of the mind. If one cannot discern even ordinary matters, how much less can they grasp the great Dao? Those who do not know what to convey are of the kind afflicted with deafness and blindness.

The Dao is the ultimate principle: all things with form arise from it, yet it remains their closest kin—nourished by the Dao, they take form. Those who eat of the grains and breathe the *qi* live long, yet the Dao is their true sovereign—granting life without form. All who learn wisdom draw from it, yet the Dao is their ultimate teacher—bestowing knowledge without instruction. The Dao is their parent, their lord, and their master.

People generally harm what is useful by clinging to what is useless. They labor at vain pursuits, injuring the emotions that have bounds. Thus, knowledge that is not broadened leaves one perpetually wanting. The noble one often reflects that their understanding is yet insufficient, and they strive daily to better themselves. If one spends their days on games of chance yet seeks the Dao, their insights will be profound. But if one shifts the labor of games of chance to focus solely on *virtue* and the Dao, they may attain even greater depths.

Asking and not asking differ as much as deafness and blindness separate one from others. Those who neither hear nor ask are truly the deaf and blind of the world.

Laozi said: *"Human nature must submit to virtue, not to force. One can be governed by virtue, not by coercion."* Virtue comes or does not come from without. Virtue given to others does not await their return. Therefore, the sage who wishes to be honored by others first honors others; who wishes to be revered by others first reveres others; who wishes to overcome others first overcomes themselves. The lowly one who humbles others first humbles themselves. Thus, nobility and humility, reverence and lowliness—all are governed by the Dao.

The ancient sage-kings spoke to others in humility, yet they led by example. Even if all under heaven joyfully followed them without tiring, and revered them without wearying, it was because their virtue was abundant and their *qi* aligned with the Dao. Hence, they knew that giving is taking, and following is leading—thus approaching the Dao itself.

To honor others is not to honor their persons, but to take honor; to lead others is not to lead their persons, but to take precedence. This is the *qi* aligning with the Dao, and virtue returning to oneself. Thus, they are followed without weariness, and revered without burden.

Laozi said: *"Those with little virtue yet much favor are scorned; those with inferior talent yet high position are in peril; those with no great deeds yet abundant wealth are despised."* Thus, things may sometimes bring gain yet cause loss, or loss yet bring gain. Talent hidden without proper display invites scorn and danger, and such must inevitably follow loss and gain in turn—this is the verification of fate.

The common folk all know what is profitable as profit, yet they do not know that what is harmful can be profit, and what is profitable can be harm. The common folk know profit as profit, yet they do not know that profit can be harm. The sage knows that profit is harm, and that what is not harm is true profit.

Thus, the twice-cut tree will surely wound its roots, and the hoarding family will surely face ruin. Great profit often turns to harm—that is the Way of Heaven. The tree that is felled twice will be wounded at its roots, and the family that buries treasure will face calamity upon itself. These are things gained not by intention—first profit, then harm—that is the Way of Heaven.

Laozi said: *"The petty man acts daily for mere gain, the noble man acts daily for righteousness."* Those who do good are not seeking fame, yet fame follows them; fame does not align with profit, yet profit returns to them. Their aims are the same, but their ends differ. The petty man acts for gain, and profit brings them harm. The noble one follows the Dao, not seeking profit, yet fame comes to them. Thus, they receive the same profit yet face different harms.

Therefore, beneficial action is inevitably followed by loss. Speech that lacks constancy brings no lasting truth, and those who gain without constancy are petty men. They do not uphold their virtue steadfastly, and may later suffer shame for it. To excel in one matter and master one skill is mediocrity. Their vision is not comprehensive, and they are confined to one domain. To cover all and possess all, to employ all abilities and talents—that is the sage. Silent of deceit, free of sorrow, they entrust virtue to the worthy and employ ability to the capable.

Laozi said: *"Life is borrowed, death is returned. Thus, in times of order, one protects righteousness with their life; in times of chaos, one protects their life with righteousness. On the day of death, the way is fulfilled. In times of order, one safeguards their life with righteousness; in times of chaos, one sacrifices their life for righteousness."* Therefore, the noble one benefits others, and even death does not bring regret.

Thus, they regard death as returning home—no different from the years of life. Therefore, the noble one is cautious only in their singular use of this life.

To act in accordance with the Dao is to move without deviating from the right path. Hence, life is received from Heaven, and fate is met with time. One may have talent yet not encounter the age, which is Heaven’s doing. To seek it has a method, and to attain it lies in fate. To meet the time is fortune; to not meet Heaven is misfortune. When they gain, they do not rejoice; when they lose, they do not resent.

「The noble one may act in virtue without necessarily receiving blessings, nor avoid wickedness to escape misfortune. To do good does not always bring fortune, nor does abstaining from evil always prevent calamity—yet they never abandon righteousness to seek blessings. Why? Because their nature cannot be reckless, and their heart remains undivided.

Thus, the noble one advances when the time is right, attaining blessings through virtue—what greater fortune could there be? When the time is not ripe, they retreat, yielding with propriety—what greater misfortune could there be? Therefore, though they dwell in poverty and low estate, they still regret nothing, for they hold what is truly precious.

To advance is not to rejoice in fortune, for virtue is their gain. To fail is not to feel shame, for what cause is there to repent? Their devotion lies in the Dao and righteousness—how could they suffer from mere poverty?

Laozi said: *"One has the qi of compliance and resistance, which arises from the heart. When the heart is orderly, the qi flows in compliance; when the heart is disordered, the qi resists. The heart’s order or chaos lies in virtue/power (德). To gain the Dao is to order the heart; to lose the Dao is to disorder the heart. An ordered heart brings mutual yielding; a disordered heart brings mutual contention. Yielding is virtue/power; contention breeds thievery. Virtue/power brings compliant qi; thievery spawns resistant qi. To unify the heart is to comply and remain upright; to split the qi is to resist and become perverse. Uprightness elevates the Dao; perversity invites harm.

When the Dao endures, the spirit is clear, and clarity brings harmony. When thievery arises, the qi becomes turbid, and turbidity brings contention and chaos. Once turbid and chaotic, destruction comes without delay.

Compliant qi leads one to self-sacrifice for others; resistant qi leads one to harm others for self. The two qi can be governed by the Dao. What cannot be resolved by deeds can be regulated by the Dao. Heaven’s Dao is like the echo that answers sound—virtue accumulated brings blessings, and misdeeds accumulated bring resentment. If humans act in accordance, Heaven can discern it; good and evil intentions are revealed as clearly as reflections in water.

Corruption arises from flourishing corruption; filial piety wanes when children and wives are neglected. Troubles stem from easing worries too soon; illness worsens when desires are unchecked. Thus, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, lest affairs fail.

Corruption fails due to deviation from proper law; filial piety declines when hidden in private matters. Though worries may temporarily ease, one must still fear their recurrence; though illness may briefly abate, restraint of desires remains essential. Therefore, to be as cautious at the end as at the beginning ensures no failure in affairs.

Laozi said: *"To lift the crooked and make it straight—how could one not gain? To lift the straight and make it crooked, do not comply, lest you share their filth yet differ in your mud."* To know others is difficult; to judge them must be clear. Now, if one lifts the crooked as if it were straight and takes the foolish for the wise, how could they share filth while differing in mud?

Laozi said: *"The sage and the fool share death and life. The sage’s sharing of death and life lies in their understanding of distinctions; the fool’s lies in their ignorance of gain and harm. The sage unifies death and life, neither favoring nor harming either, so they transcend death and life. The fool separates death and life, fixated on gain and loss, thus falling into death and life.

The Dao originates from Heaven, things are produced by Earth, and harmony resides in humans. Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang are unbalanced, winds and rains come untimely, and the people suffer from sickness and famine when the ruler is not harmonious.

The Dao is rooted in Heaven, things are born from Earth, and harmony lies in humans. Humans are Heaven’s essence and Earth’s spirit. Therefore, to rule as a sovereign, one must harmonize the qi, settle all things, and then winds and rains will not err, and calamities will not arise.

Laozi said: *"To command a hundred thousand soldiers is not as valuable as to hear a single fitting word; to possess the Lord of Hui’s pearl is not as precious as to know the reason for its acquisition; to hold the Heirloom Jade is not as prized as to know the proper use of it. A single beneficial word outweighs a hundred thousand soldiers; a single fitting action surpasses the Heirloom Jade and Lord of Hui’s pearl. Though the world be vast, those who delight in warfare perish; though a nation be secure, those who forget war are in danger. Therefore, small states with few people, though they possess myriad implements, do not use them. Great states do no better than to cultivate virtue/power; small states do no better than to serve their people—then conquest and warfare do not arise, and all ranks dwell in peace.

Laozi said: *"Those who can become hegemons or kings must be victors; yet they do not oppose without the Dao. Those who can defeat enemies must possess virtue/power; yet without virtue/power, they cannot prevail. Those who can use others’ strength must win their hearts—employing the wise to gain the people’s loyalty. Those who win others’ hearts must also attain self-mastery; self-mastery comes from yielding to those stronger than oneself, yet overcoming those equal or weaker. The victory of yielding surpasses the strength of those equal or weaker—this cannot be measured by ordinary means. Thus, only the sage can use the many’s inability to achieve great victory by preserving humility and yielding.

Only by preserving humility and yielding can one overcome what the many cannot. Thus, they achieve their great victory.

*End of Volume Four*
*End of Volume Five of the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* [通玄真经]*」

「The *Master of Literature* from the Song dynasty, **Zhu Bian**, who held the posts of **Chief Clerk of the Grand Court of Justice** and **Magistrate of Jinyun County, Kuizhou**, now annotates the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* chapter.

The **Dao/Way** is the inherent principle that pervades all things; **virtue/power** is the comprehensive name for all that is acquired. Moreover, the *Wenzzi* [《文子》] has a total of twelve distinct chapters, yet only the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* is repeated—why is this so?

The **Dao/Way of virtue/power** is the same as the **Dao/Way that can be applied to things**; the virtue/power that arises from what can be spoken of is also the virtue/power that can be relied upon. But this is not the **Ultimate Dao/Way** or the **Mystic Virtue/Power**. Therefore, the first chapter is titled *Dao/Way’s Origin* [《道原》], and the latter *Supreme Virtue/Power* [《上德》]. The former refers to the **root of the Dao/Way**, while the latter denotes the **peak of virtue/power**—this chapter serves as the bridge between the two.

The essence of **Dao/Way and virtue/power** lies in returning to their natural origins. In the human world, to practice the **Dao/Way**, establish virtue/power, cultivate one’s self, and refine one’s reputation—while living with purpose and dying without decay—there is none like this chapter.

The *Wenzzi* inquires about the **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** transcends learning; the ultimate principle cannot be questioned. What is queried here is the **Dao/Way of analogical reasoning**.

Laozi said: *"If one does not master learning and inquiry, one cannot deeply grasp the Dao/Way."* Those who study seek to restore their innate nature. By indulging in inquiry, one becomes receptive to answers; by cultivating learning, one reaches the state of *wu xue* [无学, "beyond learning"]. If one does not master this, how can they fathom the profound essence?

For those who listen, the aim is to attain **enlightened wisdom**—the wisdom of the **sage-philosopher**. To cultivate **conduct**—the practice of **benevolence and righteousness**. To achieve **merit and reputation**—the merit of a **worthy minister**. If one does not refine their learning, they will not understand; if they do not delve deeply, they will not grasp. Refined learning leads to clarity; deep inquiry leads to comprehension. Thus, the **superior scholar** listens with **spirit**, the **middle scholar** with **mind**, and the **inferior scholar** with **ear**.

The **superior scholar** comprehends the **Dao/Way** to attain **enlightened wisdom**; the **middle scholar** appreciates the **Dao/Way** to cultivate **conduct**; the **inferior scholar** wanders in the **Dao/Way** to gain **reputation**. Listening with the **ear** means learning is superficial; listening with the **mind** means learning penetrates to the muscles; listening with the **spirit** means learning reaches the marrow. Shallow and deep are relative.

Thus, if one does not listen deeply, their understanding will not be clear; if their understanding is unclear, they cannot exhaust its precision; if they cannot exhaust its precision, their actions will not be sincere. If one does not listen deeply, they lack present clarity—this is the unexcelled state.

He who does not comprehend within yet acts sincerely without has never been heard of. The principle of listening is to maintain a **vacant and tranquil mind**, diminish one’s **qi** without excess, meaning to **subdue one’s passions to align with the Dao/Way**. To have **no thought, no deliberation**, to **avoid random sight**, and to **avoid indiscriminate hearing**—to restrain both inner and outer faculties and uphold its intent.

To focus and accumulate with precision, to merge one’s inner intentions fully—once obtained, one must **steadfastly preserve** it and **sustain it enduringly**. To concentrate on what is gained, to have **no divided or wandering thoughts**, then the **nature of clarity** will naturally encompass all principles, exhausting their subtleties. Things cannot alter it; it will always be in harmony with the times.

The **Dao/Way** is the **origin of all things**, giving rise to what has **beginning** and **form**. It begins with **softness and weakness**, yet culminates in **firmness and strength**. It begins as the **Mother of the Dao/Way**, all **qi** being soft and weak; it manifests in **substance and quality**, where nature becomes firm and strong. It begins with **fewness and brevity**, yet becomes **abundance and length**.

Thus, **eternal generation** is not few, making it **abundant**; **sustaining life** is not brief, making it **enduring**. A hundred-foot tree begins as a sapling; a thousand-step terrace starts with its foundation. This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven**.

The **sage** follows it. The **Dao/Way** encompasses the small to make it great; Heaven pairs the lowly to make them high. Observing its **beginning** and its **completion**, one can **revere the subtle origin**. Therefore, the **sage** follows it.

The **humble** lowers themselves to **gain elevation**; they **honor the lowly** to **attain reverence**. The **retiring** step back to **lead ahead**; they **avoid conflict** to **secure precedence**. The **frugal** embrace **smallness** to **achieve breadth**; their **modest use** leads to **abundance**. The **self-restrained** desire **less** to **attain greatness**; their **cultivation of virtue/power** makes them **vast**.

This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven** fulfilled. The **Dao/Way of Heaven** diminishes excess and benefits humility; the **sage** conforms to it, naturally achieving **universal benefit**.

The **Dao/Way** is the **precedent of virtue/power**; from the **substance of the Dao/Way**, virtue/power is realized. It is the **root of greatness**, the **origin of the Two Polarities** [《两仪》]. It is the **gateway to fortune**, the **means of tranquility**. All things await it to **generate**, await it to **complete**, await it to **rest**.

They all rely on **nothingness** for this. The **Dao/Way** is **non-action** and **formless**; it does not precede things or leave traces in phenomena. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When **achievement and conduct** are established, it becomes **neighboring with Heaven**.

He who practices the **Dao/Way** can **act without doing** yet **accomplish all things**—this meaning has already appeared in the *Dao/Way’s Origin* chapter. Few know its precision; its precision is most true, and within it lies **faith**. It responds to **sensations** and arrives naturally—is this not **faith**?

When the **Son of Heaven** [天子] possesses the **Dao/Way**, the **world submits**, and his **reign endures**. The **Dao/Way** is to **adapt to one’s station** and **harmonize accordingly**. Thus, **Emperor Yao** and **Emperor Shun** [尧舜] had it, and their **supreme virtue/power** could be praised. **King Tang** and **King Wu** [汤武] had it, and their **divine achievements** were immortal.

This is the **Dao/Way that can be spoken of**—is it not so? When the **feudal lords** [诸侯] possess the **Dao/Way**, their **people live in harmony**, and they **do not lose their states**. In ancient times, the **feudal lords** had their **states**.

When the **scholar-officials and commoners** [士庶] possess the **Dao/Way**, they **preserve their lives** and **protect their kin**. The **strong and mighty** with the **Dao/Way** **conquer without war**; the **type of Jin and Chu** [晋楚], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, became **hegemons**—not through **outmaneuvering enemies** to **achieve victory**.

The **weak and small** with the **Dao/Way** **gain without contention**; the **type of Cao and Wei** [曹卫], who possessed the **Dao/Way**, found **allies**—not through **taking the lead** to **secure their position**.

When undertaking **actions** with the **Dao/Way**, **achievement is realized**, and **fortune is attained**. Those who **conform to the times** will see their **achievements**; those who **cultivate what is upright** will receive their **fortune**.

Between **ruler and minister**, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **loyalty and benevolence**—」

The ruler shows benevolence, the minister displays loyalty. Between father and son, the **Dao/Way** manifests as **filial piety and parental kindness**—the father is kind, the son is filial.

For the common folk, the **Dao/Way** means mutual love, without transgressing proper order, and harmony arises naturally. Thus, the **Dao/Way** brings harmony; its absence brings harshness.

When each upholds their **nature and vital essence (xìngmìng)**, even differing customs can be harmonized. If one oversteps their proper station, even kin will turn cruel. How then can families or states without the **Dao/Way** avoid ruin?

From this, it is clear that the **Dao/Way** is universally applicable—whether in small or great matters, it is always fitting.

The **Dao/Way** brings small virtue and small blessings to those who practice it slightly, great virtue and great blessings to those who practice it greatly, and universal submission when practiced fully. Submission leads to affection. Adapt to circumstances and draw from it without exhaustion.

Those who fully embody the **Dao/Way** will have all under Heaven willingly submit to them. Thus, the **Son of Heaven (Emperor)** is what all under Heaven naturally turn toward, while the **King** is what all under Heaven willingly follow. Though "turn toward" and "follow" may seem similar, they differ in essence—one is the natural alignment of **nature and vital essence**, the other is compelled necessity. Examining their principles, their superiority or inferiority becomes clear.

Without natural alignment or willing submission, one cannot be called an **Emperor** or **King**. To hold a position without virtue is unfit.

Thus, **Emperors and Kings** cannot succeed without the people, nor can they endure if they lose the **Dao/Way**. Having relied on the masses to establish their rule, they must then depend solely on themselves—how can this be sustained?

Those who abandon the **Dao/Way** indulge in extravagance, arrogance, and insolence. They flaunt their excesses, cling to rigid strength, provoke enmity, and lead armies. They take the blame while others reap the credit—this is the state of one who has strayed from the **Dao/Way**.

When the common folk act thus, they bring ruin upon themselves—even to execution. When the great act thus, their families and states perish, and nobles lose their domains, while ministers lose their households. The harm may begin with themselves but extends to their descendants.

Thus, no crime is greater than abandoning the **Dao/Way**, and no resentment is deeper than lacking virtue—this is the **Way of Heaven**.

Those without the **Dao/Way** defy Heaven; those without virtue oppress all things. Logic dictates that crime and resentment stem from this.

**Laozi** said: *"The practitioner of the **Dao/Way** makes even the boldest hesitate to strike, and the most skilled fail to hit their mark. They can restrain hostile **qi**, skillfully respond to circumstances, and master the subtle arts of the **Dao/Way**."*

Even if one does not strike or hit, if they still suffer humiliation—though unharmed, they are attacked with insults—this is already evident. It is better to make even the boldest dare not strike, the most skilled dare not hit. Through humility and gentleness in self-preservation, boldness cannot overstep. Without provoking conflict, even the cunning cannot prevail.

If they do not dare, it is not that they lack intent, but that they cannot make others lack intent. It is better to make others naturally lack such intent.

If one abandons eccentric displays and strange conduct, embracing boundless naturalness and blending with others like waves, then who under Heaven would harbor ill intentions toward them?

If others lack such intent, it is because they have no desire for gain or harm. It is not that one can make others’ hearts turn toward themselves, but rather that all under Heaven—men and women alike—willingly embrace them with affection and benefit.

The ultimate function of the **Dao/Way** is to make all under Heaven willingly submit, and all things find their benefit. Thus, even if external threats are repelled, this is still insufficient.

True mastery lies in blending with the masses, mingling with the common folk, making oneself the source of their love and benefit, and standing in the realm of **nature and vital essence**—without personal ambition, yet naturally transforming into the wondrous. This is the pinnacle of the **Dao/Way**.

Such a one needs no title to rule, no office to lead—all under Heaven, from insects upward, naturally seek what benefits them. Thus, without position or authority, they can govern all under Heaven.

Boldness in daring leads to killing; boldness in restraint leads to life. Boldness in striking and piercing kills in the heart; boldness in gentleness and weakness preserves all things through the **Dao/Way**.

**Wénzǐ** asked about **virtue (dé)**, and **Laozi** replied: *"Nurture and nourish, guide and grow—comprehensively benefiting without partiality, aligning with Heaven and Earth. This is called **virtue**."*

Human life inherently interacts with things externally and engages with affairs internally—harmony with the outside world is unavoidable. Only by internally abandoning love and hatred, and externally transcending gain and loss, can one govern all things without suppression, and transform the myriad realms without obstruction. Without this **Dao/Way**, comprehensive benefit is unattainable.

To act violently is to lose the inherent harmony of **virtue**—how can one align with **virtue** in a single act?

What is **rén (仁, benevolence)**?
*"For the ruler, not to boast of achievements; for the subjects, not to shame their flaws—this is not yet complete. Toward the great, not boastful; toward the small, not stingy. Universally loving without partiality, enduring without decay—this is **rén**."*

Only the most refined **nature** can sustain this without decay. Thus, the wise and sagely find it difficult to rank as the foremost of the Five Teachings.

What is **yì (义, righteousness)**?
*"For the ruler, to assist the weak; for the subjects, to uphold principle. In prosperity, not to overstep; in adversity, not to abandon resolve. Aligning with the **Dao/Way** and principle, without private deviation or perversion—this is **yì**."*

**Principle** is correctness. **Unity** is constancy. To make correctness and constancy the standard, without allowing private deviation, is the only way to endure.

What is **lǐ (礼, ritual/propriety)**?
*"For the ruler, to be reverent and dignified; for the subjects, to be humble and respectful. Retreating, yielding, and maintaining gentleness—being the feminine complement to Heaven under Heaven. Standing firm in what one does not dare, establishing what one cannot—this is **lǐ**."*

This is not merely bowing and ascending in rank. It is inner harmony and outer decorum.

Thus, cultivating **virtue** makes the subjects obey; cultivating **rén** makes the subjects not contend; cultivating **yì** makes the subjects fair; cultivating **lǐ** makes the subjects respectful. When all four are cultivated, the state is stable.

**Life** is the **Dao/Way**; **growth** is **virtue**; **love** is **rén**; **correctness** is **yì**; **respect** is **lǐ**.

「If one does not nurture and provide, one cannot fulfill the growth of all.
If one lacks kindness and love, one cannot achieve completion.
If one does not uphold correctness and rectify, one cannot endure long.
If one does not show respect and honor, one cannot attain nobility and worth.

Thus, **virtue** is what the people hold dear—
when **virtue** can secure them, none under Heaven do not cherish their safety.
**Rén** is what the people cherish—
all things and emotions naturally gravitate toward its benevolent love.
**Correctness (Yì)** is what the people fear—
when there is no private gain, none do not fear what is upright.
**Ritual/Propriety (Lǐ)** is what the people revere—
when dignity and order are observed, none do not respect and honor it.

These four are the harmonious principles of civilization,
the means by which the **Sage** governs all things.
If one does not align with the proper order of civilization,
then myriad emotions arise chaotically,
and governance becomes impossible.

A **gentleman** without **virtue** invites resentment from his subjects—
for suppressing their nature, resentment arises.
Without **rén**, contention arises among the subjects—
for lacking benevolent care, they contend.
Without **correctness**, brutality arises among the subjects—
for overstepping their proper boundaries, they become violent.
Without **ritual/propriety**, disorder arises among the subjects—
for losing the proper sequence of conduct, they rebel.

When these four principles are not established,
it is called having no **Dao/Way**.
Not perishing is rare indeed.

**Laozi** said:
In the age of **ultimate virtue (至德)**, merchants find profit in trade,
farmers take joy in the fields,
great officials fulfill their duties with ease,
scholars cultivate their **Dao/Way**,
and common people delight in their occupations.

Thus, winds and rains do not destroy or break,
plants and trees do not wither and die—
**virtue** extends to all things,
so **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** harmonize,
and all living beings fulfill their natural growth.

The **Yellow River** gave rise to the *Tuguan* (河图),
the **Lu River** to the *Shushu* (洛书).
But as the age declined,
taxes and levies became excessive,
slaughters and punishments knew no end,
and those who offered counsel were killed—
the **Sage** and the worthy were slain.
Thus, mountains crumbled and rivers dried up,
creatures moved restlessly without cease,
the wilds lacked even a hundred stalks of grain.
Poisonous vapors seeped into the people,
and resentment festered below—
when **qi** rebels against **Heaven** and defies the natural order,
disasters and famines emerge.

Thus, when the age is well-ordered, even the foolish cannot act alone in disorder,
and when the age is chaotic, even the wise cannot govern alone.
The efficacy of the **Sage** and the worthy cannot override the **Dao/Way** of the times.

Therefore, the **Sage** maintains harmony, pleasure, and tranquility—
this is **life**.
They never grow anxious or restless to the detriment of their natural **virtue/power**.

When one’s **aspirations (志)** align with **Dao/Way** and action,
this is **fate (命)**.
Because they understand **fate**, they find peace in both adversity and prosperity.
Thus, **life** encounters **fate**, and only then can one act,
**fate** meets with the right **time (时)**, and only then can one discern its meaning.
When **fate** aligns with **Dao/Way** and proper action,
and the **time** is favorable,
then success is achieved.

There must be the right age,
before there can be the right person.
If the **time** lacks a **clear-minded ruler (明王)**,
then the **Sage** and the worthy have no place to stand.

Thus, the *Chapter on the Nine Guardians (九守篇)* states:
Without the right age, who could succeed?

**Wénzǐ** asked about **Sage**ly wisdom,
and **Laozi** replied:
To hear and know is **Sage**ly;
to see and know is wise.
The **Sage** knows through the **heart (心)**,
the wise know through the **eyes (目)**.

Thus, the **Sage** always observes where misfortune and blessing originate,
and chooses their **Dao/Way** accordingly—
by selecting the **Dao/Way** of tranquility and guarding it,
they avoid becoming the cause of calamity.

The wise always perceive misfortune and blessing in their formed states,
and choose their actions accordingly—
by selecting the **Dao/Way** of uprightness and caution and cultivating it,
they can preemptively block the seeds of disorder.

The **Sage** understands the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** and its auspicious and inauspicious signs,
and thus knows where misfortune and blessing originate—
the **Sage** knows that **lack (不足)** brings auspiciousness,
while **excess (有余)** brings inauspiciousness,
for these are the sources of misfortune and blessing.

Thus, to guard tranquility is not to act first—
the **Sage** does not initiate disturbance.
The wise perceive the signs of misfortune and blessing in advance,
and thus know the gates through which they arise.
The wise are not confused by their initial growth,
and so they avoid sudden and irreversible calamity.

To hear before it arises is **Sage**ly,
to see before it forms is wise,
and to have neither hearing nor seeing is foolish.

**Laozi** said:
If a ruler loves knowledge,
they will trust the **time** and rely on themselves,
abandoning **fixed principles (数)** in favor of thought alone.
This means trusting the age that confounds them,
using it as their own understanding;
discarding the inevitable **fixed principles**,
and employing only what thought can grasp.

Knowledge is vast, yet wisdom is shallow—
to govern the vast with shallow wisdom is impossible.
Relying solely on one’s knowledge,
one will often fail in what is certain.

The **Dao/Way** of things has many proper courses,
but wisdom has limits—
thus, one cannot govern all,
and many failures ensue.
Loving knowledge is the **Dao/Way** of exhausting one’s arts,
loving courage is the **Dao/Way** of peril and ruin.
The **Dao/Way** that exhausts one’s arts
is the **Dao/Way** that leads to ruin.

To love giving is to have no fixed boundaries—
because they love giving, they lack constancy.
If the ruler’s boundaries are not fixed,
then the subjects’ expectations know no end—
when the ruler bestows gifts without measure,
the subjects hope endlessly in vain.
If taxes and levies are excessive,
then the ruler becomes the enemy of the people,
and heavy burdens invert the **Dao/Way** of joy in distribution,
thus resentment begins as enmity.

To take little and give much—
this is impossible in practice.
A tax of one-tenth (十一而税)
would still fail to meet the unending demands of the state.

Thus, to love giving is the **Dao/Way** that invites resentment.
To distribute wealth unevenly among the people
causes resentment among the officials,
and to impose heavy taxes on the people
causes resentment among the soldiers.
From this, it is clear:
When wealth is insufficient to fulfill its duties,
the **Dao/Way** and principles can be illuminated by reflection.

**Wénzǐ** asked:
How did the ancient **rulers** govern the world with the **Dao/Way**?

**Laozi** replied:
Hold to **Oneness (一)**, do nothing—
follow the transformations of **Heaven** and **Earth**.

To hold to **Oneness** means to hold to nothing.
To do nothing means to dare not act.
If one remains thus unassumingly,
then they follow the natural disposition of things and govern accordingly,
and what could be more fitting than to align with **Heaven** and **Earth**,
sharing in their transformations?

The world is a great instrument—
it cannot be seized, nor can it be forced.
To seize is to lose it,
to force is to ruin it.
To be able to manage one thing well,
one must fail in managing myriad things.
To hold to one disposition,
one must lose the myriad dispositions of all things.

To hold to **Oneness** is to see the small—
not to bear even the weight of a blade of grass,
is this not humility and modesty?
To see the small is to achieve the great.
And when one does not bear the weight of anything,
yet relies on others to succeed,
then they achieve even greater governance.
To do nothing is to guard stillness—
meaning they do not initiate action.
By guarding stillness, they can set the world aright.

Those who love action
injure the natural disposition of things.
Thus, to follow the great **Dao/Way** of the world,
and move with the transformations of the **Way**,
then all things find their proper place,
and their nature is naturally rectified.»

To dwell in fullness yet overflow not,
to reside in nobility yet be free from arrogance.
To see the small and guard stillness,
thus there is no arrogance or overflow.

To dwell in fullness without spilling,
abundant yet never deficient;
to reside above without arrogance,
elevated yet never perilous.
For the **Dao/Way** is thus.

Abundant yet never deficient,
this is how one endures lasting wealth;
elevated yet never perilous,
this is how one endures lasting nobility.

Wealth and nobility do not depart from their person,
blessings extend to descendants.
The ancient **Way** of kings,
aspired to this alone.

Only by attaining this **Way**,
can one establish the world.

**Laozi** said:
"The people have the **Dao/Way** they follow in common,
and laws they uphold in common,
all revering the **Way** of righteousness,
yet fearing the **Way** of statutes and punishments.

Righteousness cannot secure them,
nor can awe compel them,
thus a ruler is established to unify them.

The people cannot forever uphold what is righteous,
nor can they concentrate on what they fear,
thus a ruler is established to standardize and unify them.

A ruler who holds to **Oneness** is ordered,
who deviates from constancy is in chaos.
Chaos arises from governance without constancy.

The **Way** of the ruler is not to act,
but to act without acting.

Governance values stillness—
why act before things?
To guide the people by their nature and transform them,
this too is not to act.

The wise do not use **virtue/power** for personal gain,
but those who use the **virtue/power** of governance
as their own true capacity,
these are not the wisdom of a sovereign.

The brave do not use force for violence,
but those who wield coercive might
as violent thunder,
these are not the courage of a ruler.

The benevolent do not use rank as favor,
but those who grant the **Way** of Heaven
as personal benefit,
these are not the kindness of a king.

This may be called **Oneness**.
To embody these three is to hold to **Oneness**.

**Oneness** is the **Way** without partiality,
the root of all things.
Pure and still, guarding **Oneness**,
they move yet remain unaware.
All things trace back to their root,
and do not depart from this.

A ruler who frequently alters laws,
a nation that frequently replaces rulers—
frequent changes in laws and measures,
the people cannot endure.
A nation without roots,
how long can a ruler endure?

By their rank, people express their likes and dislikes,
the common path of the lower orders,
too numerous to govern.
The Son of Heaven relies on his eminence
to grant rank without restriction,
indulging the nature of likes and dislikes,
and thus fostering private inclinations.

Laws and edicts proliferate,
the lower orders follow many divergent paths,
too numerous to govern.

Thus, when a ruler loses **Oneness**,
his chaos exceeds that of a nation without rulers.
For when there is no ruler,
the people still uphold righteousness to support one another,
and all submit to one another.
Because they cannot endure, a leader is established.

Now, if a ruler instead becomes the cause of chaos,
then it is better to have no ruler at all.

A ruler must hold to **Oneness**,
and only then can they govern the multitude.

**Wenzzi** asked:
"Does the **Way** of kings have many branches?"
**Laozi** replied:
"**Oneness** alone.

To attain **Oneness** alone.

**Wenzzi** said:
"In antiquity, there were those who ruled by **Dao/Way**,
and those who ruled by arms—
why is it **Oneness** alone?"

He said:
"Those who rule by **Dao/Way** rely on **virtue/power**;
those who rule by arms also rely on **virtue/power**.
The sovereign attains **virtue/power** by **Dao/Way**,
the people attain it by righteousness.

There are five types of warfare:
**righteous war**, **responsive war**, **wrathful war**, **greedy war**, **arrogant war**.
To punish the violent and rescue the weak,
this is **righteous war**;
when enemies come to attack,
and one must use arms to defend oneself,
this is **responsive war**;
to quarrel over trivial matters,
to wage war for petty reasons,
this is **wrathful war**."

「When the heart cannot prevail,
this is called **wrath**;
to covet another’s land,
to desire another’s wealth,
this is called **greed**;
to rely on one’s nation’s grandeur,
to boast of one’s people’s multitude,
and seek to surpass rival states—
this is called **arrogance**.

**Righteous war** brings sovereignty,
for it unites the hearts of all under Heaven.
**Responsive war** achieves victory,
for it strikes only after the enemy moves first.
**Wrathful war** meets defeat,
for it cannot endure even minor setbacks.
**Greedy war** ends in annihilation,
for it cannot defend itself.
**Arrogant war** leads to extinction,
for excess defies the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
This is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.

Laozi said:
*"To abandon the **Dao/Way** and rely on cleverness brings peril;
to discard the **natural laws** and depend on talent brings ruin.*
**Release** means to set aside.
**Natural laws** are Heaven’s constant principles.
All who abandon the **Dao/Way** and rely on cleverness
find no day secure.
All who discard the **natural laws** and depend on talent
become inferior and cannot succeed.

Thus, to uphold one’s proper measure and follow what is inevitable—
when lost, one need not grieve,
when gained, one need not rejoice.
Success is not something one strives for,
gain is not something one seeks.
He who adheres to his own **Dao/Way**’s measure
and follows what must be
simply entrusts himself to Heaven’s command,
remains tranquil amid fate’s unfolding—
whether success or gain comes,
it lies in chance alone.
Thus, there is no grief or joy,
for it concerns only the inner self.

To receive is to accept what comes,
to give is to bestow without expectation.
Embracing the **Dao/Way**, one encompasses all things—
though one receives, it is not greedy taking.
Embodying **virtue/power**, one benefits all ranks—
though one gives, it is not private favor.

Like spring’s birth and autumn’s death,
what is born does not resent its fate,
what is taken does not harbor grudges—
this nears the **Dao/Way**.
To forget personal desires within,
to act in harmony with the seasons—
how could resentment take root in the heart?

**Wenzzi** asked:
*"How does one govern all under Heaven and win their joyful allegiance?"*

The Master Laozi said:
*"If one is like the great rivers and seas—
humble yet not overflowing,
capacious yet not discriminating,
then one may be said to embody the **Dao/Way**’s return to all things,
and to exhaust the hearts of the multitude below.
Vague and without fixed taste,
its use is never exhausted.
Empty, tranquil, and detached,
yet its responses are boundless.

First small, then great.
First, bring the small to submission with benevolence,
then complete the vast and profound.
To elevate oneself above others,
one must first humble oneself in speech;
to lead others,
one must first place oneself behind them.
Thus, the world must follow its joyful love—
for all things below ascend to above,
and those who hold back take precedence,
this is but following the **Dao/Way**’s natural course.

What one grants to others,
the **Dao/Way** of joyful love will naturally gain their sincerity.
Advance their kindness and justice,
yet without harshness.
Though one stands above,
the people do not feel burdened;
though one leads,
the masses are not harmed.
The world willingly follows and never tires—
even in distant lands or strange customs,
as insects flutter or worms crawl,
none fail to cherish and love.

When principles align with the right,
things gravitate toward affection.
Yet with kindness and righteousness as the core,
all customs and ranks know what to embrace,
and follow with delight, never weary.

Without it, nothing flows;
without it, nothing succeeds—
thus, it is most honored in the world.
He who holds this **Dao/Way**,
has no need for restrictive laws before him,
all paths are open,
what is more noble than this?

The Master Laozi said:
*"To cling to laws of a single age,
and reject customs of successive generations,
is like gluing a pillar to a zither while tuning it—
the five tones must blend and shift to form harmony,
and laws must adapt to each age’s needs.
Tuning lies in variation,
one cannot glue a pillar;
governing lies in fitting the times,
one cannot rigidly cling to laws.

The Sage adapts to time’s changes,
and acts according to circumstances—
thus avoiding rigid adherence.
When the world shifts, so do affairs;
when times change, so do customs.
To analyze the world and establish laws,
to act in accordance with the times—
the myriad peoples’ emotions and deceptions vary,
customs are never uniform.
The Emperor’s nature and governance differ,
each age brings its own gains and losses.

To establish affairs with the times,
who but the Sage can fully grasp?
The rulers of antiquity,
their laws and measures varied—
not out of contrariness,
but because their duties differed.
Thus, one does not follow their fixed laws,
but follows how they made them.
For how they made them,
was in accordance with the shifting transformations.

Their fixed laws,
like sacrifices to Heaven or offerings to Earth,
are for their own time—
how could they be rigidly imposed?

Only those who follow shifting transformations can be lawful,
and must be followed.

The Sage’s laws are visible,
but their reasoning cannot be traced.
Laws are applied outwardly,
where they may be seen,
yet their inner principles remain unfathomable.

Their words may be heard,
but their true intent cannot be defined.
The words of laws may be passed down,
yet the origins of their intent are inherently obscure.

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors
ruled lightly over the world,
treated all things with care,
equalized life and death,
harmonized with transformation.
They abandoned their thrones with ease,
and met each moment with perfect alignment.

Embracing the **Dao/Way** and extending sincerity,
they mirrored the myriad things’ emotions.
When the **Dao/Way**, laws, and sincerity are clear,
they may be universally observed.

Above, they befriended the **Dao/Way**,
below, they treated transformation as their kin.
Going and returning, all is the **Dao/Way**—
the **Dao/Way** is their eternal friend.
Motion and stillness lie in transformation—
transformation governs their people.

Now, if one seeks to learn their **Dao/Way**,
yet does not grasp its purity and clarity,
they fail to follow the **Dao/Way** of the pristine and ancient.
The Sage of old, if placed in this age,
still applying ancient laws,
would surely fail to govern.

Moreover, to hold fast to the past while ruling today,
is to ignore time’s changes;
to study the past with today’s eyes,
is to miss its clarity.

It is best to take the times as one’s guide,
and expand upon them.

**Wenzzi** asked about governance,
and the Master Laozi replied:
*"Rule them with the **Dao/Way**,
nurture them with **virtue/power**,
for with the **Dao/Way** to rule them,
the people find their proper place.
With **virtue/power** to nurture them,
the people know where to return.

Do not display your wisdom,
do not exert your strength—
if a ruler values the wise,
the court becomes a battleground for renown;
if a ruler relies on coercion,
he gathers resentment in one place.
To harm while clinging to one thing,
is to diminish wisdom and strength,
yet to uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.

To exploit opportunities is to lose the virtue of universal love,
to indulge in visible desires is to disrupt the steadiness of governance.

Square yet not rigid,
sharp yet not piercing—
square does not demand cutting,
solid does not require carving,
both allow things to remain whole.

No boasting, no self-praise—
no boasting of ability,
no self-praise for deeds.

To rule with the **Dao/Way** is to gain the people’s attachment,
and their affection.
To nurture with **virtue/power** is to gain their submission,
and their devotion.

To not display wisdom is to ensure their sufficiency,
each finding their own.
To not exert strength is to keep them simple—
none knowing what to resent,
and all preserving themselves.

To not display wisdom is to practice frugality,
to not exert strength is to refrain from arrogance.
When the ruler is frugal in his use,
the world lacks nothing.
When the ruler refrains from arrogance,
all things remain naturally whole.

To gather from below,
to take with gifts,
to preserve through frugality,
and to secure through restraint—
this is the **Dao/Way** of winning the people’s love,
and gathering them in harmony.

To provide ample sustenance,
and return it with benefit—
when frugality ensures sufficiency,
desires are extinguished,
and **virtue/power** is preserved.
When restraint ensures security,
resentment is absent,
and all is at peace.

To not gather is to scatter,
to not nurture is to rebel.
To display wisdom is to invite contention,
to exert strength is to invite resentment.
When the people scatter, the state’s power declines;
when the people rebel, the ruler’s authority fades;
when the people contend, governance becomes light;
when the people resent their ruler, his position is in danger.

If these four evils are truly avoided,
the **Dao/Way** is nearly complete.
If the ruler can perfect all **virtue/power**,
and eliminate these four harms,
then though called the **Dao/Way** of virtuous governance,
it is also close to the pure winds of antiquity.

The Master Laozi said:
*"When the ruler speaks,
the people act;
when the people speak,
the ruler acts—
to accept the people’s words,
and follow their counsel as water flows."*

To honor the ruler’s words,
his actions emerge like silk threads.

The ruler’s words are always heeded,
and the people revere antiquity.

**This** is the art of **flexibility**.

To establish teachings comes from the ruler,
thus his words are always heeded.

When counsel is given and **must** be accepted,
the precious thing is to know **flexibility**.

Only the Sage can truly know **flexibility**—
his words are always trusted,
his decrees always fulfilled.

When words are trusted, the end brings proof,
when decrees are fulfilled, the return ensures harmony.

The highest conduct in the world—
to stand upright and defend one’s father,
to be true and rescue one’s drowning mother—
who can truly value this?

A father’s child is seized, and he defends his uprightness;
a mother is drowning, and he fulfills his promise to save—
if such lofty conduct exists,
who would dare to show pity?

Thus, the Sage judges the right and wrong of matters,
and adjusts with them in bending and extending,
without fixed rules or outward forms.

The Sage follows what is fitting in each circumstance,
using it as his model and standard.
His actions are for the benefit of the people—
how could he be bound by a single moment?

To **bless** is to honor the ruler,
to **drown** is to **dishonor** the ancestors and invite retribution.

The father, compelled by circumstances.
**Dishonor**, to pull by the hair.

For the ruler and father’s dignity,
when faced with **blessing** or **drowning**,
to not honor the ruler is disrespect,
to not pull by the hair is unfilial.

Circumstances force what is contrary—
to save what can be saved is all.

**Flexibility** is what only the Sage can truly see.
The subtleties of **flexibility** are too refined,
ordinary emotions cannot grasp them.

When one first opposes and then aligns—**this** is **flexibility**.
When one first aligns and then opposes—**this** is ignorance of **flexibility**.
Ignorance of **flexibility** will turn good into shameful.

Let me test this with an argument:
To master **flexibility** is to stand between the two realms of **circumstances** and **opportunity**.

Before **circumstances** arise, one must consider **opportunity**;
after **opportunity** is seized, one must act.
**Circumstances** lie in the matter,
**opportunity** lies in the heart.

Only **flexibility** can internally awaken **opportunity**,
externally control **circumstances**,
and uphold the proper **Dao/Way** and teachings
while ensuring that later compliance and prior opposition
fully realize the **Way** of perfect adaptation.

The ruler has his **principles**,
actions have their **advantages** and **disadvantages**—
to let the people act as if by nature,
while they remain unaware of the reasoning behind it.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* praises the **reverence** of **gentle adaptability**,
and the *Book of Songs* extols the **virtue** of **chastity and splendor**—
who but the Sage’s wisdom
could alone perceive this?

If **opportunity** and **circumstances** are not handled carefully,
they will harm oneself.

If **flexibility** is not applied appropriately,
good will turn to shame—
how can one not be cautious?

Wenzi asked:
"Master, your teachings say
that without **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,
one cannot govern the world.
Yet rulers of ancient times,
following the legacy of their predecessors,
also had those without **Dao/Way**
who perished in their own era
without facing ruin—
how does **Dao/Way** explain this?"

What is called
**"falling"** the **virtue/power** of ancestors,
while still avoiding ruin in one’s own time—
it is because earlier generations had such cases.

Thus, I could not help but raise this question,
to warn rulers of later generations
who doubt the **Dao/Way**.

Laozi said:
"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people,
each lives as they please,
yet their lives vary in richness.
In the world, there are times of fallen kingdoms and ruined families—
**this** is not due to lack of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.

When one says there are those who perish in their own time
without facing ruin,
it is only because of the **thickness** of their **fate**.

Yet when kingdoms fall and families ruin,
none escape without losing **Dao/Way** first.

Day and night without rest,
trembling and fearful,
always dreading danger and fall—
those who have **families** and **kingdoms**,
truly must be cautious like this,
thus it is said:
'You stand before your ancestors,
like a rotting rope guiding six galloping horses.'

If one indulges desires and neglects duty,
their fall will come without delay—
**this** is simply impossible to preserve.

Even if **Jie** and **Zhou** practiced **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
though **Tang** and **Wu** were wise,
they would have no foundation for their achievements.

In the decline of **Xia** and **Yin**,
it was not only **Jie** and **Zhou** who lost **Dao/Way**—
yet some perished in their own time
without immediate ruin,
though there were differences in **fate**,
all shared the same cause of destruction.

If those two rulers had relied on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
then how could **Tang** and **Wu** have established their achievements?

It is rare for one who loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** to escape ruin,
but none who uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** invite disaster.

**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are what
nurtures and sustains life,
what fosters growth and longevity,
what brings mutual affection,
what earns reverence and honor.

The **virtue/power** of **Dao/Way**’s nurturing,
the beauty of **respect** and **love**,
are established from here.

Even a deaf worm, though foolish,
does not harm what it loves—
if the people of the world
all harbored hearts of **benevolence**,
how could calamities arise?

The world is full of deaf and foolish beings—
are they not like crawling insects?
Yet they can still avoid harm and seek benefit
to suit their own nature,
then the emotions of the people
can surely be understood.

If one truly follows the **Dao/Way** and **transforms** through **virtue/power**,
evoking the hearts of mutual affection,
the roots of calamities will have no cause to arise.

Those without **Dao/Way** yet without ruin—
**benevolence** has not yet vanished,
**righteousness** has not yet perished.
Because **benevolence** has not vanished,
the **virtue/power** of mutual affection remains;
because **righteousness** has not perished,
the **virtue/power** of mutual support remains—
though in danger, they are not yet destroyed.

Even if **benevolence** has not vanished,
and **righteousness** has not perished,
the feudal lords already disdain their ruler.

When feudal lords disdain their ruler,
the court becomes disrespectful,
even if it does not rebel outright.

The utmost **reverence** and **obedience** lie in
**responding** to the ruler’s **virtue/power**.

When **benevolence** vanishes and **righteousness** perishes,
the feudal lords rebel,
the common people rise in force,
the strong oppress the weak,
the great encroach on the small—
the people make violence their occupation,
disasters multiply,
calamities arise—
their fall will come without delay,
how could they hope to avoid ruin?

When **Dao/Way** is lost, **virtue/power** is abandoned;
when **virtue/power** is lost, one clings to **benevolence**;
when **benevolence** vanishes, **righteousness** upholds;
when **righteousness** perishes, the kingdom falls.

**This** is how ruin comes—
a gradual process,
all contributing to disaster.

Thus, when one loses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,
there will be disdain for the ruler and defiance of commands.

Following the loss of **benevolence** and **righteousness**,
there will be fear of kingdom’s fall and personal humiliation.

Yet one’s body has its **fate** of richness or thinness,
a kingdom has its **destiny** of danger or ruin—
those with **thick** **fate** may endure danger throughout their lives,
those with **thin** **fate** will face ruin at the proper time.

Examining the root cause,
none escape without losing **Dao/Way**.

Laozi said:
"When laws are excessive and punishments severe,
the people resort to deceit.
When the ruler is overburdened with affairs,
the people become scheming."

Necessarily, they must employ manifold schemes to manage affairs.
Seeking much yields little, forbidding much results in few obeying—
for when transgressions multiply, few are punished,
and when offenses abound, few are victorious.
Affairs breed more affairs;
using affairs to halt affairs
is like fanning flames and hoping they will not burn.
If one ceases all affairs, then affairs cease.
But if one uses affairs to stop affairs,
the halted affairs resurge anew.
To stop the affairs that generate them
only to spawn the affairs that were halted—
this is like fanning fire to seek non-burning
yet only to burn more.

**Wisdom** generates calamity—
meaning the wise generate lesser calamities.
Yet they also counter it with wisdom,
like agitating water and hoping it will remain clear.

When the ruler abandons cleverness,
the people preserve their nature whole.
The root of calamity lies in manifold schemes—
once calamity arises from wisdom,
then wisdom is again employed to prevent it.
Yet the way of natural clarity, undisturbed, is far beyond this.

Laozi said:
"If a ruler favors benevolence,
then the unmeritorious are rewarded,
and the guilty are pardoned;
if he favors punishment,
then the meritorious are discarded,
and the innocent are ensnared.
For benevolence uses compassion as its merit,
and punishment uses blame as its function—
if one has preferences,
then rewards and punishments become excessive and indiscriminate,
and cannot govern the myriad people."

Let us examine this:
**Dao/Way** is the most precious of all things.
Affairs are all accomplished through what one favors.
Yet if one establishes preferences to seek **Dao/Way**,
then preference remains in the heart,
while **Dao/Way** is abandoned in what is sought,
and thus contradicts its own principle.

It is also said:
"Those who do not lose **virtue/power** are thus without **virtue/power**."
Moreover, **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**—
these cannot be achieved by favoring one alone,
let alone by partiality toward lesser matters
to govern the world.

Without favor or aversion,
one punishes without resentment,
and gives without expecting gratitude.
Like the seasons of Heaven,
how could anything bear grudges?

Following the plumb line and the measuring cord,
the body is uninvolved in affairs—
like Heaven and Earth,
how could they not cover and nourish all?
Trusting in natural measure without contrivance,
one harmonizes with the two polarities in **virtue/power**.

The one who harmonizes and unifies is the ruler;
unifying all in harmony rests with one person.
What differentiates and distinguishes is law.
The offender naturally faces varying degrees of penalty—
this is the constant law of the state.
The people receive punishment without harboring resentment,
the ruler shows no partiality,
and clears the world of guilt—
then those who meet punishment gladly accept their fault,
without blame or grudge.
This is called **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.

Only then does the state have the **Dao/Way** of great peace,
and the ruler possess **virtue/power** without self-interest.

Laozi said:
"The world’s right and wrong cannot be fixed—
each age upholds what it deems good
and rejects what it deems evil.
What you deem evil, others may deem good,
and what you deem good, others may deem evil—
this is not a public standard,
so it cannot be fixed.

Those who seek what is right do not seek **Dao/Way**,
but follow the principles of **Dao/Way**—
then all things are mysteriously unified, and nothing is wrong.
To seek what aligns with oneself is not to reject externality,
but to reject what contradicts the heart.
If one merely seeks alignment,
then partiality attaches to things—
how can this be called rejecting evil?
One only removes what is hated.

Now, if I wish to choose what is right and dwell in it,
and reject what is wrong and abandon it,
I do not know what the world calls right and wrong.

Those who seek what is right cannot make it so,
and those who reject what is wrong cannot entirely eliminate it.
If I choose what is right to dwell in
and what is wrong to reject,
how do I know the world will not cling to its own right
and accuse me of wrong?

If so, then my alignment with what is right
has not yet escaped bias—
this is the art of governing right and wrong,
yet it cannot be the rule for governing the world.

Thus, governing a great state is like poaching a small fish—
one must not disturb it.
Agitate a small fish, and it will disintegrate;
disturb the myriad people, and they will dissolve in chaos.
Therefore, those who establish laws and ordinances to distinguish right and wrong
cannot govern effectively.

Those who seek harmony—
if their words are flattering yet accurate,
they grow closer to the ruler,
but if they are distant in body yet loyal in counsel,
they are met with suspicion.
The common sentiment of the world
has no public right—
only private alignment is deemed right.

Thus, flattery that is accurate brings closeness,
while loyalty that is distant invites suspicion.
Even if I wish to correct myself and await others,
how do I know what the world will use to scheme against me?
If I wish to correct myself and await others,
will there not be those who, because of my non-conformity,
will instead hold my correctness against me?

If I hastily flee with the customs,
I am like one escaping rain—
there is no place untouched by dampness.
If I correct the world,
the world will also scheme against me—
to hastily contend for correctness
is futile in avoiding decline.
It is like fleeing rain—
wherever one goes, one is still wet.

To dwell in emptiness yet cannot be empty,
for the heart has attachments—
thus it is not empty.
As for deliberate correctness,
one’s actions are never truly correct.

But if one does not strive to be empty yet is empty,
this is what one desires and achieves without effort.
If one rides the flow of things and follows **Dao/Way**,
without aversion to existence,
then one is empty without striving to be empty.
If one rests in the world’s ease without rejecting others,
then one does not contend for correctness yet is correct.

Now, to attain emptiness without labor,
and correctness without choice—
is this not what was desired,
all achieved effortlessly?

Thus, those who penetrate **Dao/Way**
are like a cart axle that does not move itself,
yet with the wheel reaches a thousand miles—
turning at the boundless source.
Remaining centered and unmoving,
one travels with all things,
unhindered by distance or proximity.

Moreover, the wheel of ten thousand transformations
never ceases—
yet my responsive essence
is boundless in its reach.
Thus, the sage embodies **Dao/Way** and returns to its origin,
does not transform to await transformation,
and acts without doing.

Those who embody **Dao/Way**
are ever-present yet unchanging.
With unchanging transformation,
one governs myriad transformations—
and this wondrous function
is not of deliberate action.

Laozi said:
"Those who frequently win battles
will inevitably bring ruin to their state."

Thus, frequent warfare exhausts the people,
and repeated victories breed arrogance in the ruler.
To govern with an arrogant ruler and weary people
and yet avoid national ruin—
few such cases exist.

When the ruler grows arrogant, he indulges himself,
and indulgence leads to excess.
When the people are weary, resentment grows,
and resentment breeds cunning.
Excess in things leads to ruin,
and cunning in governance leads to upheaval.
When both ruler and people reach extremes,
the state cannot but perish.

Thus, when achievements are complete,
the sage withdraws—
this is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.

**Chapter on Supreme Virtue**

Things have no master—
**Dao/Way** alone is constant.
Its use harmonizes with all,
and its mysterious power accumulates naturally.

Thus, with gentleness, one governs the world,
yet never claims possession.
Knowing how to unite all living beings,
nothing escapes its proper order.

Yet the essence of supreme virtue
penetrates everywhere—
hence this chapter’s blend of inclusiveness and emptiness.

Laozi said:
The ruler is the heart of the state,
the source of its survival or ruin.
When the heart is at ease, all functions align;
when the heart is agitated, all functions falter.
The body’s hundred limbs
are like the state’s hundred offices.

Thus, when the body is in order,
its limbs act without deliberation;
when the state is in order,
ruler and ministers forget their roles.
When limbs act naturally, they find their own ease.
Thus, one forgets what one serves—
ruler and ministers fulfill their roles without effort,
and so forget their origins.

Laozi’s teacher, *Changshu*,
taught: *"See the tongue and hold to gentleness."*
Teeth are hard, the tongue is soft—
what is rigid perishes first.
Thus, softness is advantageous—
this is what should be upheld.

Gazing upward at the house’s beams,
then withdrawing to gaze at the river—
soft branches rise to the roof’s height,
weak materials occupy the uppermost places.
Thus, one elevates what is before one’s eyes,
making humility a mirror of retreat.

Observing one’s shadow to know how to follow—
what moves behind never strays from propriety,
like a shadow following form,
unbound by tilt or turn,
for it does not contend with things—
thus it remains constant.

Hence, the sage embraces emptiness and follows naturally,
always yielding yet never leading—
like stacked firewood, where the last placed rests above.
This is called *"fulfilling virtue to achieve function."*

Laozi said:
*"The bell’s sound destroys itself,
the candle’s light consumes itself,
the tiger’s stripes invite arrows,
the monkey’s agility invites capture—
thus, the valiant die by strength,
the eloquent are ensnared by cleverness.
These all perish by their own advantages.
Though one may know cleverness,
one does not know the advantage of not-knowing.
Only those who possess cleverness
fail to grasp the use of not-knowing.
Thus, the bold in one skill,
the skilled in one argument,
can be led astray with partial truths—
but cannot respond to myriad transformations.
Only those who do not rely on cleverness,
who do not dare to act by skill,
can meet all changes."*

**Dao/Way** is formless—
seen, it has no shape;
heard, it has no sound.
It is called *"profound and obscure."*
This term describes **Dao/Way**,
yet is not **Dao/Way** itself.

The wondrous origin enters the boundless—
never for an instant separated from all things.
Its essence is profound and dim,
its function manifest and clear.
Though named with force,
it claims no dominion.

**Dao/Way** is inward reflection—
abandoning desire, returning to simplicity,
one finds clarity naturally.
When one finds clarity,
the world finds its own.

Thus, one is neither slightly awake
nor deeply lost,
neither slightly wise
nor utterly foolish.
Only those who cling to knowledge
fail to return to the vastness of not-knowing.

Do not mirror the flowing stream—
mirror the still water,
for it preserves its stillness without disturbance.
Only those who do not let things disturb the heart
can then respond to all things.

The moon wanes when the sun rises—
opposing vigor with stillness,
stillness must be complete.
Only those without rivals can remain still.

Yin does not override yang,
low does not transgress high—
only then can one preserve its proper place.
When the sun rises, stars vanish—
they cannot contend with its light.
Great virtue in the world
humbly conceals lesser virtue.

The end cannot surpass the root,
the branch cannot exceed the trunk—
heavy above, light below—
its fall is inevitable.

If one seeks to dominate the heart,
movement will bring ruin.
One pool cannot hold two dragons,
one female cannot mate with two males—
one is fixed, two contend.
Thus, opposites cannot dwell together—
only the victorious are settled.

Jade in the mountains makes grass and trees lush,
pearls in the depths keep the shores moist—
**Dao/Way** in the center harmonizes all forms.

The earthworm, lacking strong bones or sharp claws,
feeds on dry soil above and drinks from the Yellow Springs below—
its power lies in singular focus.
*Xīkè*—dry, clumped earth.

When form has no reliance,
the heart has no dependence—
and without dependence,
even mud and water can sustain life.

Clarity is illumination—
a cup of water reveals the pupil’s depth.
Turbidity is harm—
the Yellow River cannot hide Mount Tai.
If one clarifies the mind’s inch,
one can discern all things—
not dependent on the size of form or vessel.

Orchids do not lose their fragrance
for lack of wearers;
boats do not sink in the rivers and seas
for lack of passengers;
the virtuous do not cease their **Dao/Way**
for lack of recognition—
this is their inherent nature.

Grass and trees bear fruit by natural endowment,
yet practicing **Dao/Way** diminishes daily.
The petty cannot compare—
only those who align with their nature
can the world truly learn from.
This is the sage’s intent:
to cultivate habit into nature,
to match Heaven’s nature—
how could one settle for fixed fate without cultivation?

To enter purity from impurity brings constraint,
to enter impurity from purity brings ruin.
To serve when not the proper time is ripe,
the wise will inevitably suffer.

「If one advances without the proper talent,
the foolish will inevitably meet ruin.

When Heaven’s two *qi* meet, they form a rainbow—
*yin* above, inverted, clashing yet not harmonized,
resulting in the rainbow’s fleeting appearance.

When Earth’s two *qi* meet, they bring floods and drought—
*yang* below, applied unevenly in virtue,
inevitably causing floods and drought to stagnate.

In humans, these two *qi* manifest as illness.
Joy and anger mingling in the chest—
this is the source of disease.
*Yin* and *yang* do not remain constant,
sometimes winter, sometimes summer,
moons unaware of day,
days unaware of night.

For the *yin* and *yang* of day and month,
if they lack even a trace of impurity,
they fulfill the function of transformation and nurturing,
establishing the fixed virtue of alternating light and dark.
Thus, the ranks of ruler and subject,
the norms of male and female,
are inherently distinct in order.

Some say: "Among the grandest of forms and *qi*,
none surpass *yin* and *yang*, day and moon,
yet they cannot preserve their virtue completely—
how much more so for all other things?"

Only the **Dao/Way**’s application,
when practiced consistently,
can be called supreme.

Wide rivers yield great fish,
tall mountains grow towering trees,
vast lands nurture deep virtue.
If not rooted in principle,
growth will not last.
Hence, one cannot fish without bait,
nor lure beasts without traps.
To achieve one’s aims,
one must first prepare the necessary means.

Mountains hold fierce beasts,
yet their forests remain uncut;
gardens teem with venomous insects,
yet their melons and cucumbers are still gathered.
A realm possesses virtuous ministers,
who can resolve conflicts a thousand *li* away—
as when Yue dared not attack Wu.

---

「Those attuned to the Dao/Way move like a cart axle turning within its hub,
never exerting itself yet reaching a thousand *li*,
endlessly returning to its origin.

All things move day and night on their own,
yet none can fully grasp their essence.
Only the boundless void that remains motionless
can fully align with their nature.

How much worse for those who fail to understand the Dao/Way,
toiling yet unable to govern the distant!

Thus, it is better to raise the crooked with the straight,
than to fail in raising the straight with the crooked.
Do not force what cannot be achieved—
this principle is revealed in *The Chapter of Talismans*.

A bird approaches, nets are spread to await it—
he who catches the bird is the one who holds the net’s eye.

If one sets only a single net’s eye,
they will never catch a bird.
The sage establishes teachings,
not because there are many paths,
but because the nature of all things requires varied approaches,
thus spreading many net’s eyes.

Yet those who enter the true path
reach a single perfect harmony.

To govern a family or state,
to gather and employ diverse talents—
this is the same principle.

Thus, some matters cannot be preordained,
some things cannot be foreseen in advance—
the sage stores the Dao/Way and waits for the right moment.
What is meant by storing the Dao/Way and awaiting the time?
To lure fish, one must first know the valleys,
to attract birds, one must first plant trees.
Water accumulates, and fish gather;
trees flourish, and birds assemble.
If one recognizes their nature and sets the trap,
even different kinds will converge.

To act in accordance with the fish’s virtue,
one does not drag them into the depths—
to act in accordance with the monkey’s virtue,
one does not carry them up the trees—
one merely releases them to their advantage.

Virtue/Qi applied to things
does not demand perfection of their natural state,
nor does it value artificial methods to restrain their essence—
thus it is said: "Release them to their advantage."

Where one’s feet tread is shallow,
and shallow is limited,
yet only by waiting for what has not yet been trodden
can one achieve distant governance.

Where one’s mind seeks is narrow,
yet only by advancing beyond what is not yet known
can one truly comprehend the Dao/Way.

When rivers run dry, valleys empty,
when hills are leveled, depths are sealed,
when lips vanish, teeth grow cold,
and when the Yellow River’s waters are deep,
its silt lies upon the mountains—
wherever there is entanglement,
one’s true nature cannot remain intact.

When water is still, it is clear,
when clear, it is calm,
when calm, it is simple,
when simple, one sees the forms of things—
forms cannot coexist,
thus they can be distinguished.
Only by preserving inner clarity and stillness
does one naturally attain comprehensive insight,
responding with great constancy.

What causes leaves to fall is the wind’s sway,
what causes water to become turbid is external interference—
this is what is meant by "harming their nature."

The shaping of jade into a *bi* disc is the work of a craftsman,
the refining of a *jian* mirror is the effort of a polisher,
the cutting of *mó* axes is the strength of a whetstone,
the grinding of *li* blades is the force of a grindstone.
Without carving, jade cannot become an instrument,
without polishing, it cannot be sharp—
thus, one must apply vigorous study and practice to advance along the Dao/Way.

The gnat and the steed both reach a thousand *li* yet do not fly,
the gnat lacks provisions yet does not starve—
those who rely on what they can attach to
and surrender their essence without reservation
achieve their aims without seeking them.

The cunning hare is caught and the hunting dog is cooked,
the high-flying bird is exhausted and the fine bow is hidden—
this is the Dao/Way of achieving success while preserving oneself.
Many such cases exist in antiquity,
where opening a realm and establishing merit
led to death and dishonor—
examples abound, too numerous to recount.

Thus, those who understand the Dao/Way of Heaven
know how to begin and end well.
Anger arises from what was not anger,
action from what was not action—
true insight lies in grasping the root of things,
not in valuing their superficial outcomes.

The sage acts with non-action to penetrate this principle,
not because past non-anger
led to creatures growing insolent and then provoking anger,
nor because past non-action
caused matters to decay and neglect until action was forced.

To see without seeing,
one attains what is seen;
to listen without hearing,
one attains what is heard.
To fixate on what is seen causes constant dazzlement,
to fixate on what is heard causes constant confusion—
how can this be called true perception?
Only by reversing this approach
does one fully employ perception.

Birds return to their homelands,
hares flee back to their burrows,
foxes die on their ancestral mounds,
and cold cicadas seek shelter in the trees—
all things ultimately return to their roots.

Water and fire repel each other,
yet the *dǐng* cauldron and *lí* steamer exist between them,
balancing the five flavors.
Bone and flesh love each other,
yet a slanderer placed between them
makes father and son endanger one another.
If one skillfully employs their methods,
even opposing natures can be harmonized—
yet if one harms their Dao/Way,
even Heaven’s natural order can be corrupted.

Dogs and pigs eat without discrimination,
thus their bodies grow fat,
and they approach death.
If one seeks office without discernment,
even if wealth enriches their family,
their own lives grow perilous.

The *fènghuáng* phoenix soars to heights of a thousand *rèn*,
yet none can harm it—
it does not enter unstable realms,
nor dwell in chaotic states—
who would dare to use snares and traps upon it?
With a hundred spears, one cannot pierce its limits,
yet its eyes can see a hundred *bù* away—
its vision does not stop at the corners.

The world’s pursuits
all seek distant gains from things,
yet cannot reflect closely upon themselves.

If one uses elevation to create mountains,
they become stable and not perilous;
if one uses depression to create ponds,
they become deep and fish and turtles gather there.
To occupy a position of honor and accumulate virtue/Qi,
one becomes high and unassailable.
To dwell in an uncontested place and add humility,
one receives what the world offers.

When trenches and ponds overflow,
they dry up in times of drought—
the source of rivers and seas
flows endlessly without exhaustion.
If one does not grasp the source,
they will fluctuate with external conditions—
only by knowing the origin
can one preserve their constancy.

The deaf have no ears yet cannot be deceived by sight,
for they are refined in clarity—
the blind have no eyes yet cannot be deceived by sound,
for they are refined in hearing.
Each use has its proper application,
and they do not interfere with one another—
this is called refined focus in one use,
not divided refinement.

Muddled water is turbid,
yet can it wash my feet?
A confused world can hide my body and obscure my traces.
Clear water sparkles,
yet can it wash my *yīng* headband?
A transparent world allows me to rise in office and take my place.

Silk, when made into *guā* white cloth,
can become a crown or a *xiè* sandal.
A crown is worn upon the head,
a sandal is placed upon the feet—
thus, one use does not interfere with another.

「Its constancy is thus established.
　　The deaf have no ears yet their sight cannot be deceived—refined in clarity;
　　The blind have no eyes yet their hearing cannot be deceived—refined in perception.
　　Who would then complain or grieve?
　　Gold’s strength surpasses wood—
　　Yet one blade cannot harm an entire forest;
　　Earth’s strength surpasses water—
　　Yet one dipper cannot dam a river;
　　Water’s strength surpasses fire—
　　Yet one sip cannot extinguish a cartload of fuel.
　　Though one holds the means to control,
　　If their virtue and power are insufficient,
　　It is as if they gain no benefit at all.

　　Winter’s thunder, summer’s hail,
　　Cold and heat do not alter their seasons;
　　Frost and snow descend in abundance,
　　Yet melt when the sun rises.
　　Before the winter solstice, the yang-qi descends and forms thunder;
　　Before the summer solstice, the yin-qi ascends and congeals into hail.
　　Even in the months of extreme cold or heat,
　　Their changes are never entirely cut off.
　　If frost and snow are applied to them,
　　They will vanish with the sun’s light—
　　This is what is called *inner necessity* (*zhōng yǒu bìrán*), which cannot be externally controlled;
　　*Seasonal necessity* (*shí yǒu bìzhì*), which cannot be altered by things.
　　Only the wise and enlightened discern this for proper application.

　　Tilt easily topples, lean easily adheres;
　　A slight push aids, moisture easily brings rain.
　　Thus, the virtuous act accordingly and pass on their teachings—
　　Their methods are simple yet effective.

　　The orchid’s fragrance thrives,
　　Yet if it does not see frost,
　　It withers in the midst of its prime—
　　How could those of talent not be cautious?

　　The toad repels soldiers,
　　Its lifespan ending on the fifth month’s full moon.
　　If taken at the halfway point of the fifth month and burned,
　　It can repel soldiers but its poison harms—
　　This is talent being harmed by misuse.
　　Is it not said that one can be divine in things yet fail to divine themselves?
　　Such as the white tortoise dreaming in the Song and Yuan courts—
　　How lamentable!

　　Those whose *qi* is dissipated are prone to inner decay,
　　Whose actions invite external harm.
　　Fruits out of season are inedible.
　　Even if they possess their own vitality and luster,
　　They can disrupt my natural constitution.

　　Which comes first to ruin—the tongue or the teeth?
　　Which is straight—the bowstring or the arrow?
　　The teeth, being rigid, wear first;
　　The arrow, being straight, bends first.
　　What is supple and yielding preserves the virtue of rigidity and straightness.

　　Shadows distort form,
　　Echoes distort voice—
　　One must guard their roots.

　　To treat the dead as if they were alive is no good physician,
　　To serve a fallen kingdom as if it were still standing is no loyal counselor.
　　Thus, a ruler must be open to medicinal advice.

　　When discussing difficulties,
　　One can still enforce strict discipline and refine the *qi* to overcome them;
　　When the proper course is impossible,
　　One may combine expedients and adapt to changes to assist.
　　No material is wasted, no principle abandoned—
　　Seizing intent and harmonizing meaning may lie therein.

　　Therefore, the saying: *"A ruler governs ministers, ministers serve the ruler—
　　Each must be cautious in their approach."*
　　If one commands the *chāngchuí* flute yet lacks control,
　　The ruler’s authority will perish.
　　*Què*—to fix or determine.
　　One cannot fix the pitch of music.

　　If a ruler and minister violate proper order,
　　Or if one usurps political authority,
　　Even if the punishments are correct,
　　They cannot be properly enforced.
　　If one examines positions and laws accordingly,
　　This is called *"ruler’s punishments"*—double gain.

　　The deaf cannot sing to find joy,
　　The blind cannot observe to engage with the world—
　　Yet when the heart has its expectations,
　　Form and sound naturally arise.
　　Thus, calming the heart means nothing external remains.

　　Walking through the woods cannot follow a straight path,
　　Treading on perilous ground cannot measure a plumb line.
　　To be entangled with things is to invite disorder,
　　To confront calamity is to risk harm.
　　Yet if one walks through the woods or treads on perilous ground,
　　How could they then traverse the smooth, abandoned paths,
　　Or wander the wide, straight avenues?

　　The sea encompasses all within its domain,
　　Thus it is vast—
　　This is the virtue of containing all things.
　　He who does not close their ears and eyes yet embraces sounds and colors,
　　Who does not lock away their true nature to level all dangers and risks,
　　Such a person’s Dao aligns with the sea’s capacity—
　　They embody the virtue of harmonious reception and transformation.

　　The sun does not rise twice in one day,
　　The fox does not have two lords,
　　The divine dragon does not pair,
　　The fierce beast does not gather in groups,
　　The rapacious bird does not fly in twos.
　　The virtue of a single ruler,
　　The singularity of one application,
　　Still lacks equal or match—
　　How much more so the Dao of the Sage and the grand transformations,
　　The singular achievements of their solitary operations?

　　It is not the *liáo* whisk that can obscure the sun,
　　Nor the *fú* spokes that can outrun swiftness—
　　Yet even these are not sufficient to rely upon.
　　All who can influence things
　　Do so through relative means—
　　Verification comes from reality,
　　And this is not enough to depend on.
　　Thus, the Sage aids the world and benefits its use,
　　Extending their influence through things,
　　Riding the momentum while relying on people,
　　Accomplishing deeds and claiming their rewards.

　　Drawing the bow to shoot,
　　The string alone cannot release the arrow—
　　Yet only one in ten strikes its mark.
　　If shooting aims to hit,
　　Why shoot if it does not?
　　A hundred shots, one hit—
　　Success and failure cancel each other out.
　　Yet all under heaven build their achievements thus—
　　They forget their repeated failures,
　　Only celebrating their one success,
　　Is this not absurd in balancing reality and expedience?

　　A hungry horse in the stable
　　Is silent and still;
　　Yet when hay is placed beside it,
　　Its competitive spirit awakens.
　　The nature of blood and *qi* is never without desire—
　　Thus, when nothing desirable is seen,
　　The heart does not stir into conflict.

　　A three-inch flute cannot reach its full potential,
　　Yet the world cannot be filled by it alone;
　　Ten stones may suffice to block,
　　Yet a hundred bamboos are needed to reinforce.
　　The petty-minded have narrow ambitions,
　　Ever unsatisfied and never fulfilled;
　　The noble-minded possess spacious virtue,
　　Dividing what is needed and finding sufficiency.

　　Following the plumb line to cut does not exceed,
　　Using the balance scale to measure does not err—
　　Yet if one upholds the Dao directly,
　　They will not exceed right and wrong;
　　If one applies virtue evenly,
　　They will not err in thickness or thinness.
　　To lean on ancient laws and categories,
　　Sometimes proves effective,
　　Yet to rely solely on rigid standards,
　　Sometimes fails.
　　To govern the present while adhering to ancient laws and standards,
　　Though the plumb line and balance may align,
　　Still cannot definitively settle the world—
　　Only those who discern the times and know adaptation can.

　　To act thus is called *duàn* (judgment),
　　To act otherwise is called *luàn* (disorder).」

The law conforms to the times, it stands firm;
The law defies the times, it falls into disuse.

The farmer toils while the noble is nourished,
Laboring in cultivation to provide for the sovereign’s tribute—
Thus, if one diligently upholds the Dao,
There will be no hardship from lowly servitude.

The foolish speak, the wise choose.
Broadly gathering and praising, they select the good and act upon it.
If one possesses true wisdom,
They can establish themselves by following others.

To perceive clearly is like holding jade and stone—
Those who see principles distinctly,
Are like jade within stone, plainly discernible.
If perception is dim, one must preserve their counsel.
If vision is murky, action becomes impossible.

The brilliance of a hundred stars
Cannot match the light of a single moon,
And ten open windows
Cannot rival the clarity of one door.
Those who accumulate small wisdom, deeming themselves enlightened,
Cannot yet comprehend the myriad categories.

A belly-serpent cannot serve as a foot,
Nor a tiger as wings.
The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess,
Yet even so, if it unleashes calamity and venom,
Those who harm the world—
Should they not be feared and warned?

Now, the ancient six *chi* (feet),
Is but a single *bu* (step) of today.

To lie down and cross it, the lower talent finds no difficulty,
Yet when it lies within a single step and beneath others,
To pass over it—how difficult to stride across?
Talent and material are used in the same way.

To stand and surmount it, the higher talent is not easily attained;
If one seeks to ascend, measuring the six *chi* (feet),
As they prepare to rise, the higher talent will not easily be gained.
The circumstances differ in their application.

With the same six *chi* of material,
Yet differing in where the circumstances are applied,
Then difficulty and ease become separated,
And distinctions between high and low arise.
Thus, the virtuous avoid dwelling in the lowly stream,
And strive endlessly to strengthen themselves.

The assistant to the sacrificial rites gains a taste,
The one who rescues a drowning man gets hurt—
Those who aid in both good and evil,
Still suffer harm or benefit from it themselves.
Thus, their own consequences are clear enough.

Covered by an unlucky tree,
It is struck by thunder and lightning.
If one loses their proper foundation,
Even without encountering punishment,
They will not escape entanglement.
Hence, the virtuous choose their place carefully.

When the sun and moon wish to shine,
Floating clouds obscure them;
When clear waters wish to be pure,
Sand and soil defile them;
When fragrant orchids wish to flourish,
Autumn winds wither them;
When human nature seeks balance,
Lustful desires corrupt it.
Thus, one must be cautious in their likes and dislikes.

To be covered in dust yet wish to remain unstained—
It cannot be achieved.
I have never heard of one who avoids transgressing against *yīn-yáng* (陰陽) yet remains whole in nature.
Jade and gold are worn by the worthy as ornaments,
While coarse cloth and earthenware are treasured by the capable as wealth.
Thus, giving gold and jade to the weak
Is not as good as giving them a length of plain silk.
Things have no inherent nobility or baseness—
Only their proper use at the right time makes them noble.

Those who cannot wear jade or gold,
Nor treasure coarse cloth and earthenware,
Can truly be called those who have lost the suitability of their place
And neglected the Dao of advancing their virtue.

Thirty spokes converge upon one hub,
Each straight in its own groove,
Yet unable to enter one another—
Just as ministers each uphold their duties.
If one can arrange talents according to their proper stations,
They will then employ their strengths to achieve great distances.

The skillful use of people
Is like the legs of a centipede—
Many yet without mutual harm,
Or the tongue and teeth—
Firm and soft complementing each other without destruction.

The skillful use of ministers and subjects
Is such that officials, though many,
Have no encroachment upon their ranks;
The civil and military, though different,
Are close and complete their undertakings.

Stone is born firm,
Orchids are born fragrant—
From youth, their qualities are present,
And with age, they become ever clearer.
If one governs things according to their nature,
They will naturally succeed.
To force or restrain them,
To take or give them,
To accept or decline them—
These are as distant as heaven and earth.

Same use, yet differing in suitability,
Though near, they are far apart.
The world is full of such cases.
Hence, the Sage demonstrates them as warnings.

Those who grow twice do not reap the *shēn* (莘) grain,
While leaves that sprout too early fall without frost.
Nobility lies in moderation.
Too soon, and it loses its proper measure;
Too late, and it falls short of its due.

To sully their standard,
To powder their foreheads,
To have a rotten rat beside them,
Yet burn incense in the hall—
To enter water yet hate its dampness,
To embrace foulness yet seek fragrance,
Even the most skilled cannot succeed.

If methods are not grounded in their proper principles,
Even those who skillfully apply them
Cannot cleverly achieve their ends.

Winter ice can be bent,
Summer wood can be tied—
Opportunity is hard to obtain yet easy to lose.
It is more precious than a measure of jade and gold.

When trees are in full vigor,
They regrow even after daily cutting,
But when autumn winds descend and frost arrives,
They wither in a single night.
To act in accordance with Heaven’s Dao,
One will easily achieve their aims;
To rely solely on oneself,
One will only waste their strength.

The bowstring drawn and arrows released,
The forest dense and axes entering—
This is not summoned by any,
But the result of form and circumstance.

To stand out in the world,
One must invite universal envy.
If blessings overflow in the home,
They will not escape being coveted and taken.
A suckling pup biting a tiger,
A crouching chicken striking a weasel—
Favor is bestowed without regard to strength.
The world has no one who measures strength and guards their affection,
Only those who indulge desire without restraint,
And thus bring harm upon themselves.

Those who wait for profit to rise from drowning,
Will also drown others for profit.
To reward those who rise from drowning,
And to await them with profit—
Then the world will have none who do not wish to drown and be rescued.

The reed’s leaves spread and arrows fly in unison,
The forest flourishes and axes strike deep—
Not summoned by any will,
But the inevitable consequence of form and circumstance.

To excel in the world,
One must invite universal resentment.
If wealth abounds in the household,
None will resist its plunder.

A nursling pup daring to bite a tiger,
A hen striking a weasel while crouching—
Favor is given without regard to strength.
The world knows no one who weighs strength and guards their affection,
Only those who trust emotion and indulge desire,
And thus bring ruin upon themselves.

Those who wait for gain from rescuing the drowning,
Will also drown others for gain.
To reward those who rise from drowning,
And to await them with profit—
Then the world will have none who do not wish to drown and be saved.

---

As for Jianzi, though he profited from releasing doves,
He ended up capturing more—
This shows that the true foundation of governance
Does not lie in achieving immediate results,
But in cutting off its source.

A boat can float, a stone can sink,
Yet the foolish do not comprehend this principle.
The Sage understands the fixed laws of sinking and floating,
Thus never acts rashly.

A swift horse does not advance when driven,
Nor halt when pulled—
A ruler should not seek the Dao in such ways.
Even if the worthy are talented,
If they lack loyalty and do not offer their service,
They cannot be relied upon for governance.

Though water is level, waves must arise,
Though a balance is true, it must tilt,
Though measures are uniform, they must falter.
Even if laws and teachings are equal and fair,
Those who enforce and apply them may still err.

Without the compass and square, no shape can be defined,
Without the plumb line and level, no crookedness can be corrected.
Yet even those who use the compass and square
May harbor flaws in their own hearts.

If one’s inner sincerity is pure,
And external laws and teachings are absent,
The people’s natural order will daily reveal its path.
But if laws and teachings are widely proclaimed,
Yet inner sincerity fails to match,
Then neither will the people trust nor the world accept.

Thus, the true mastery of laws lies in the heart’s sincerity.
Hence the *Precision and Sincerity* chapter states:
*"Words spoken in unison are trustworthy,
For trust lies in the speaker’s resolve before utterance;
Orders given in harmony are obeyed,
For sincerity lies beyond the command itself."*
Does it not mean that genuine sincerity must precede the application of laws?

The Tai Mountain’s height—
Doubled, yet still unseen—
The autumn hair’s tip—
Examined, yet clearly discerned.
Things, great or small,
If turned away, become obscured,
If scrutinized, become clear.

Fire in bamboo and wood—
Without drilling, it does not spread.
Water in the earth—
Without digging, it does not emerge.
Though nature has its ways,
Only through diligent study can they be attained.

An arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*,
Yet if taken step by step without rest,
A lame tortoise can traverse a thousand *li*.
Layered ages without pause,
And hills become mountains.
To reach distant goals,
Lies in persistence, not in haste.

Thus, steady effort endures without exhaustion,
Like the foolish old man who could move mountains.
To catch fish by the river,
Better to return home and cast nets.
Mastering the root alone
Ensures self-reliance in the long term.

A bow must first be strung before seeking its strength,
A horse must first be trained before seeking its excellence,
A person must first be trusted before seeking their ability.
If one’s resolve is refined from the start,
It cannot later be refined.
Preserve one’s essence, and splendor will follow naturally.
A skilled artisan cannot burn wood,
A master craftsman cannot carve ice—
Things have their limits; how can the virtuous ignore this?
Do not fixate on what cannot be achieved.

To make people never cross the river,
Is possible;
To make the river never have waves,
Is impossible.
If there is no crossing to be made,
Then peace remains between us and them.
But if one must cross and seek to avoid drowning,
It cannot be without waves.

If a pot never falls into a well,
It will never be without blame—
Yet the pot on the hearth
Has no way to fall into the well.
Those who reproach my actions wish to engage with me,
Those who offer goods wish to trade with me.
If I do not know their true intentions,
I cannot blame them for their deeds.
Yet since their motives are hard to discern,
I must treat them with sudden directness.

A single move in chess does not reveal one’s wisdom,
A single pluck on a string does not express one’s sorrow.
To hastily accuse others
Is to fail to exhaust their potential.

Now, there is a burning coal:
If touched, it scorches one’s fingers—
Yet if placed near a pile of ten thousand stones,
All may be warmed.
If removed ten steps away,
It does not kill.
Though their *qi* is the same,
Their accumulated virtue differs—
For though their *qi* may be similar,
Those whose virtue is unevenly stored
Cannot be recklessly paired in their actions.

There is splendor, there must be decline.
If one’s nature is truly settled,
Then one can remain undisturbed by the world’s changes.
When the upper reaches are strict,
The lower must suffer.
If a lord refines his nobility,
The people will endure the burdens of lowliness.
If the lower suffer lowliness,
The upper cannot long preserve his nobility.

Great trees have deep roots,
High mountains have firm foundations—
Nobility rests in its roots.
Laozi said:
*"The drum does not hide its sound,
Thus it can produce sound;
The mirror does not conceal its form,
Thus it can reflect form.
To hoard and preserve,
One cannot always maintain it.
To empty and still,
Then all responses will naturally suffice."*

Metal and stone produce sound,
Yet they do not ring unless struck.
Flutes and shawms emit tones,
Yet they are silent unless blown.
Thus the Sage remains inwardly reserved,
Never led by external things,
Acting only when matters arise,
Responding only when things present themselves.
The Sage contains responses without prompting,
Like metal and stone.

The Dao of Heaven flows without ceasing,
Yet returns to its beginning,
Thus it endures forever.
The wheel turns repeatedly,
Thus it reaches distant places.
If Heaven’s Dao is never misaligned,
There is no excess.
Abiding in Heaven’s natural course,
One attains unchanging virtue.

When Heaven’s *qi* descends,
And Earth’s *qi* ascends,
Yin and Yang intermingle,
All things harmonize in unity.
Unity receives the nurturing *qi*,
And all things are born in equal measure.
The virtuous thrive, the depraved perish—
The Dao of Heaven and Earth.

When Heaven and Earth exchange in harmony,
The virtuous support and complement each other to achieve success.
If Heaven’s *qi* does not descend,
And Earth’s *qi* does not ascend,
If Yin and Yang do not intermingle,
All things do not flourish—
Meaning they do not multiply and grow.
The depraved gain influence,
The virtuous perish—
This is contrary to the natural order,
Thus the virtuous cultivate moderation to avoid calamity.

The Five Grains do not grow,
Yet the Dao of Virtue remains preserved.
If the Dao of Virtue is preserved,
It does not flourish—
This is the meaning of perishing.

The Dao of Heaven:
*"It diminishes the full and benefits the scarce,
The Dao of Earth:
*"It diminishes the high and benefits the low,
Both returning to balance.
The Dao of Ghosts and Spirits:
*"It harms the arrogant and benefits the humble.
The Dao of Man:
*"It shuns the excessive and favors the modest.
The Dao of the Sage:
*"It is lowly, yet none can surpass it.
Through modesty, one attains the heights,
Thus the world cannot claim the heights for itself.

When Heaven’s light is clear,
Then it can illuminate the four directions.
When a ruler is enlightened,
And his ministers are enlightened,
The realm will be at peace,
And the four seasons will bring stability.
This is the path to enduring prosperity.

The enlightenment of ruler and minister
Is not about mutual scrutiny—
It is about not obscuring the Dao of governance,
Thus aligning with Heaven’s light and comparing virtues,
And the world will find peace,
With the four seasons in harmony.

The Way of Ruler and Subject yet unaligned,
Even though Heaven’s light shines over the realm,
Chaos and darkness still prevail.

To emulate Heaven is to endure.
The application of enlightenment lies in its transformative power.
The enlightenment applied must first transform those below.

The Dao of Heaven is *wen* (pattern),
The Dao of Earth is *li* (principle).
The patterns of stars and constellations,
The principles of rivers and streams—
One unifies them in harmony,
Time governs their shifts,
Thus all things are completed—
This is called the Dao.

Qi unifies to generate life,
The four seasons faithfully nurture growth.
Pushing through transformations of myriad forms,
This is the Dao of the Celestial Sovereign.

The Great Dao is vast and near—
The body, a thing of Heaven and Earth,
How could it not be the Dao?

Cultivate it within the self,
And virtue becomes true.
If one follows naturally and accepts fate,
Unknowingly aligning with the true essence,
Then virtue arises spontaneously.

Cultivate it in things,
And virtue will never cease.
Through expansive interaction with all things,
Following their inherent principles,
And thus aligning with the boundless nature of all things,
Virtue cannot be constrained.

Heaven covers all things,
Bestowing its virtue to nourish them,
Giving without taking—
Thus, spirit returns to it.

The master of nourishment is none other than Heaven’s virtue.
Yet without form, it binds all things—
How could it be externally imposed?

Spirit is initially endowed with lightness and clarity,
Thus Heaven possesses virtue without virtue—
This is why it is exalted.
Spirit has the capacity for emptiness and openness—
This is why it is honored.
To honor and return to the exalted is natural,
As things follow their kind.

To give without taking is the virtue of the exalted—
Thus, it possesses virtue.
Without trace yet achieving success,
Without virtue yet residing above—
Nothing is higher than Heaven,
Nothing is lower than the marsh.
Heaven is high, the marsh is low—
The Sage follows this,
Establishing order of high and low,
Thus the world is settled.

The marsh should be like the Earth.
The Sage follows Heaven and Earth,
Ordering high and low,
Thus ruler and subject, father and son,
Each fulfill their proper roles—
Ancient and modern, unchanging,
This is called Great Stability.

Earth nourishes and sustains all things,
Giving and taking—
Thus bones and flesh return to it.

Heaven has the form of sustaining all things,
Earth has the virtue of providing resources,
Yet when it comes to binding all things,
Where does it claim its function?

Bones and flesh are initially heavy and turbid,
Ultimately returning to the clods of earth—
Thus Earth has the trace of enduring virtue—
This is why it is lowly.
Bones and flesh suffer from stagnation and obstruction—
This is why they are base.
To base and return to the lowly is natural,
As things follow their kind.

To give and take is the virtue of the lowly—
The lowly virtue does not lose virtue,
Thus it has no virtue.
Fully achieving traceable results,
It is not the position of exalted virtue—
Thus the Sage’s mysterious virtue aligns with Heaven,
And established virtue aligns with Earth.

Earth supports Heaven,
Thus stability and peace endure.
Earth is stable and peaceful,
Thus all things take form—
Form is like birth and growth.
Earth is vast and thick,
Thus all things gather upon it.
Stability and peace hold nothing unborne,
Vastness and thickness contain nothing unheld.
Earth’s depth and thickness gather waters and streams,
Earth’s Dao is broad and square—
Thus it endures.
Broadness holds great forests,
Squareness embodies great virtue.
The Sage follows this,
Thus virtue contains all things.
Lowliness draws things to it,
Peace brings self-possession.

When Yin harms things, Yang withdraws,
And if Yin advances while Yang retreats,
The petty gain influence,
The virtuous avoid harm—
This is the Dao of Heaven.
Motion and stillness have their times,
Thus to defy Heaven brings great calamity.

When Yang-qi moves, all things relax and find their place—
Thus the Sage follows the Dao of Yang.
To act in accordance with the times,
One can achieve desires without contradiction.

To follow things, things will follow in return;
To oppose things, things will oppose in return.
To transform thoroughly, things will not differ;
If things differ from me, transformation is incomplete.
Thus, one does not lose the nature and disposition of things.

When the marsh overflows, all things grow without measure;
Things have their inherent nature as their proper form,
And their proper time as their disposition.
To govern and teach without losing these two,
Then all things will flourish with nourishment,
All will be trustworthy and mature.

When the marsh dries up, all things wither without leaves—
Their blossoms and flowers do not appear at their proper times.
Thus, if rains do not fall in season,
The world falls into ruin and chaos—
Mountains without paths,
Oppression and neglect,
Then the people do not bear grain,
And chaos and flight ensue.

Yang ascends yet returns below,
Thus it is the master of all things.
High in position yet humble in virtue.
Highness makes things reverent,
Humility makes things affectionate—
Thus it can be their master.

Not overreaching possession,
Thus it can end and begin anew.
Its Dao wanes and flourishes,
Thus it does not reach exhaustion.
Ending and beginning anew,
Thus it endures—
Thus it is the Mother of the world.
To be the Mother of the world,
Without this virtue, how could it be?

Yang-qi accumulates before it can be bestowed,
Yin-qi accumulates before it can transform—
There is none who can transform without accumulation.
If one’s own essence is not complete,
One cannot establish affairs—
How much more to govern all things?
Thus the Sage is cautious in what is accumulated.
Only by accumulating virtue and achieving harmony
Can one be capable of transforming the world.

When Yang extinguishes Yin, all things thrive;
When Yin extinguishes Yang, all things decline.
Thus, if kings and nobles uphold the Dao of Yang,
The people will flourish—
Meaning harmonious qi nourishes the people.
If they uphold the Dao of Yin, the world will perish—
Meaning killing qi destroys the state.

If Yang does not descend to Yin,
All things cannot be completed.
Yin is low and still,
Thus Yang’s virtue does not descend—
Then transformation cannot be achieved.

The lord does not descend to his ministers,
And virtue’s transformation cannot be enacted—
Thus the ministers’ way comes to an end,
And the lord’s benevolence is not bestowed,
Then governance cannot be achieved.

Therefore, when the lord descends to his ministers,
Their wisdom is heard—
He gains the ears and eyes of all under heaven.
If he does not descend to his ministers,
He becomes deaf and blind.
A single person’s perception
Cannot be relied upon to govern all.

When the sun rises from the earth,
All things flourish and grow—
Kings and nobles dwell above the people,
Illuminating virtue and the Dao.
When great officials occupy high positions,
The Way spreads and virtue enfolds the people,
Like the sun rising from the earth,
Nourishing all things.

When the sun sets into the earth,
All things rest—
When petty men rule above the people,
All things flee and hide.
When petty men occupy high positions,
They cannot govern in all directions,
Driving the people to scatter,
Like the sun setting into the earth—
Would all things then perish and cease?

When thunder moves, all things awaken;
When rain nourishes, all things unfurl—
Great officials act in this manner:
Stirring to awaken the dormant,
Nourishing to bring forth growth.
When the sovereign issues decrees,
Like heaven’s thunder and rain,
None dare disobey his command.

The movements of Yin and Yang follow fixed seasons,
Yet great officials do not exhaust the people.
They follow the heavens and respond to the times,
Thus their actions are never misplaced.
Those who push beyond the limits of the people
Suppress their nature and bring ruin.

When thunder shakes the earth, all things relax;
When wind sways the trees, grasses and woods scatter.
Great officials abandon vice and embrace goodness—
Heaven and earth spread virtue and remove filth,
Great officials reform flaws and enact governance.
The people do not flee far,
Thus their coming and going is extreme:
They flee when wrongs are extreme,
They gather when benefits are greater.
All people love their native soil,
And do not wish to migrate—
Only when governance is oppressive beyond measure
Are they forced to depart.
When kindness and blessings reach few,
They are compelled to return.
This is not because their nature easily shifts.

The wind does not move, the fire does not emerge,
The sage remains silent, the petty do not speak.
Fire emerges only with wind,
The people follow the teachings of their superiors.

When fire emerges, it must have fuel,
When a person speaks, their words must be true.
With truth and sincerity, what cannot be accomplished?
Fire depends on fuel, speech on truth—
Thus they blaze and flourish.

If one follows teachings with constancy,
And remains true without wavering,
All endeavors shall succeed.

The Yellow River runs deep, its destruction lies in the mountains;
High hills descend into the abyss—
The principle is already evident above.

When *yang* qi prevails, it transforms into *yin*;
When *yin* qi prevails, it transforms into *yang*.
Thus, desire cannot be overfilled,
Nor joy pushed to its extreme.
Excess leads to ruin,
Extremity invites reversal.

Anger without harsh words,
Rage without showing color—
This is called *calculating success*.

To discern the way of retaliation,
Yet not to provoke blame by striking first—
This is called *securing safety through strategy*.

Fire ascends, water descends;
The Sage’s Way seeks its kind—
Though myriad things may stray,
Those sharing its principle shall all be found.

The Sage, relying on *yang*, brings harmony to the world;
Relying on *yin*, brings stagnation and drowning.
The *yang* Way nurtures and flourishes,
The *yin* Way is stern and destructive.
If virtue and blessings are spread widely,
The people shall be harmonious and content;
If only the harsh ways of Chu are employed,
The people shall sink in misery.

Laozi said:
Thin layers accumulate into thickness,
Low steps rise to heights.
Noble conduct and profound virtue arise from steady cultivation,
While initial shame and grave errors stem from repeated transgressions.
The virtuous strive earnestly to achieve brilliance,
The petty indulge recklessly to invite disgrace.
Earnest self-strengthening builds virtue daily;
Reckless indulgence in desires leads to self-ruin.
The difference lies in what is accumulated.

Though its rise and fall may not be immediately visible,
The virtuous heart does not waver in its constancy.
The Way of rise and fall lies in emulating goodness and uprightness,
Advancing swiftly toward brilliance from the start.
Thus, seeing goodness as if unable to catch up,
Treating evil as if facing calamity.
Witnessing virtuous deeds, one hastens to follow;
Encountering vice, one acts as if in disaster.
If one turns toward goodness, even exceeding bounds brings no regret;
Those who follow the Way, though blamed by others,
Shall bear no resentment toward them.
For the virtuous Way has its unchanging practice.

If one does not turn toward goodness,
Even loyalty may turn to evil—
Without an inherent inclination toward virtue,
Even if others are loyal, there shall be times of betrayal;
Though they bring harm, resentment shall arise toward them.
Yet, people and I have mutual expectations,
And constancy in virtue is not easily maintained.
To blame others for their inconstancy is unjust.

Thus, those who harbor resentment do not blame themselves,
For resentment stems from one’s own actions—
Why accuse others?
Seeking virtue in others is less fruitful than seeking it within.
Self-mastery ensures all else is obtained—
Why rely on others?
Thus, reputation is self-summoned,
Kindred spirits seek one another,
Fame is self-bestowed,
And position is self-assumed—
None of it comes from outside oneself.

Self-assumed position refers to the rank befitting wisdom or folly.
Wielding sharpness to strike, wielding blades to attack—
Why blame others?
Harming others invites retaliation;
Resentment is self-inflicted.
Thus, the virtuous must guard against the subtle beginnings.

All things bear *yin* while embracing *yang*,
Their harmonizing *qi* forming unity.
When the two *qi* blend in balance, it is called *he*.
Though things may face *yin* or turn toward *yang*,
Their vital essence receives harmony.
*Harmony* resides centrally—
Thus, grains grow in the heart,
Grasses bear fruit in their stalks,
For stalks are the heart of grasses.
Eggs and fetuses form in the center,
All born from *harmony* dwelling centrally.
Though their natures differ,
They all receive *qi* and kindred essence
From *harmony*’s central abode.

Those not born from eggs or wombs
Require time to gestate,
Moistened and dried by seasonal shifts to take form—
They too arise with *harmony*.

When the earth is level, water does not flow;
When light and heavy are balanced, the scale does not tilt.
All things’ transformations arise from response.
When *yang* prevails, life emerges;
When *yin* prevails, death ensues.
Like water in the crossroads,
It tilts with each stimulus—
Attaining *zhonghe* (central harmony),
It remains balanced and upright.

Laozi said:
Mountains reach their height, and clouds and rain gather there;
Waters reach their depth, and dragons take form within.
The Sage cultivates the Way,
And virtue flows from it.
The Way’s height and depth
Naturally spread blessings.

Those with hidden virtue shall receive manifest reward,
Those with concealed deeds shall earn renowned name.
Hidden virtue lacks artifice—
This is the truest virtue.
Concealed deeds seek nothing—
This is the most genuine conduct.
When both true and real,
Even if rewards remain unseen and names unproclaimed,
They cannot be withheld.

He who plants millet reaps not barley,
He who sows resentment reaps none in return.
Plant millet, harvest millet;
Sow resentment, reap resentment.

*Completes the Sixth Scroll of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious*
*Begins the Seventh Scroll of the Treatise on Penetrating the Mysterious*

The **Master of the Great Hall of Justice, Jù Biàn**, of the **Song Dynasty**, in his **Proper Conduct and the *Micro-Luminous* Chapter**:

*"Dao* beyond form is called *micro* (微),
*Virtue* concealed within propriety is called *luminous* (明).

Thus, without *micro* one cannot fathom the True Principle,
Without *luminous* one cannot grasp the Mysterious Intent.
The essence of *micro-luminous* lies in the duality of *body* and *function*.

Laozi said:
*The Way* can be weak, can be strong,
Can be yielding, can be firm,
Can be yin, can be yang,
Can be obscure, can be luminous,
Can enfold Heaven and Earth,
Can respond without measure.
This aligns with the intent of *The Origin of the Way* (《道原篇》).

Shallow knowing, deep not-knowing,
Knowing’s exterior, not-knowing’s interior,
Knowing’s coarse, not-knowing’s refined,
Knowing is not-knowing, not-knowing is knowing—
Who knows knowing as not-knowing,
Not-knowing as knowing?

*The Way* cannot be heard—heard, it is false;
*The Way* cannot be seen—seen, it is false;
*The Way* cannot be spoken—spoken, it is false.
Who knows the formless as form?

Thus, all under Heaven know goodness as goodness—
And so it becomes not-goodness.
The wise do not speak; the speaker does not know.

*The Way* transcends form and sound—
Hearing and seeing cannot discern it;
*Virtue* lacks embellishment—
Good and evil cannot illuminate it.

Thus, the wise do not speak; the speaker does not know—
This is the utmost attainment.

**Wénzǐ asked:** Can one be entrusted with *micro-speech*?
Laozi replied: *Why not?*
Do you mean *knowing how to speak*?
He who knows *how to speak* cannot speak *micro-speech*.
*Micro-speech* refers to the most exquisite speech.
Only when one forgets speech itself
Can one be entrusted with it.

The fisherman’s hands grow wet,
The hunter’s feet grow swift—
Not because they take pleasure in it.
Thus, the utmost speech transcends speech,
The utmost action transcends action.
The shallowly wise contend over trifles.

Speech has its *root* (宗),
Action has its *master* (君).
He who acts without knowing
Is why he is not known.

*The Way* is the ineffable marvel of the nameless,
Speech is the supreme principle of truth.
Those who grasp the marvel do not speak,
Those who illuminate the principle do not vie.
When speech reaches its utmost, it is without speech—
When action reaches its utmost, it is without action—
Yet self-awareness arises naturally.
One clings, saying, *"I know."*

**Wénzǐ asked:** Does governing a state also have its *law*?

The Master Laozi said:

Now, take the driver of a cart:
He calls *"Yā!"* and *"Chuò!"* from the front,
And the sound is answered.
The rear also responds in kind—
This is the driver’s song urging strength.
Though the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu
May differ in tone,
None surpasses this in its purpose.

Governing a state relies on *rites* (礼),
Not on eloquence or argument.
When laws and decrees grow excessive,
Thieves and bandits multiply.
The proper use of things must fit their purpose,
Each must serve its role—
Like the driver’s song urging strength,
Yet it would be misplaced to play with the music of Xianchi.
Why trouble with ornate speech
When governing a state and calming the people
Requires only the elevation of simplicity and plainness?

The Master Laozi said:
*The Way* has no fixed form yet can be the standard,
Like mountains and forests that can yield materials—
Materials do not encompass mountains and forests,
Mountains and forests do not encompass clouds and rains,
Clouds and rains do not encompass yin and yang,
Yin and yang do not encompass harmony,
And harmony does not encompass *The Way*.
*The Way* is the formless form, the symbol without substance—
Without understanding its intent,
One cannot transform and refine between heaven and earth.
*The Way* has no fixed form,
Yet fixed forms arise from *The Way*,
Just as materials do not encompass mountains and forests,
Yet mountains and forests yield materials.
From clouds and rains downward,
Those who speak of what does not encompass *The Way*
Do so because it is formless and symbol-less,
Yet it embraces all things and encompasses all *Dao* (方).
Only those who embody *The Way*
Know its boundless transformations.

The Master Laozi said:
The Sage establishes teachings and implements governance,
Yet must observe their beginning and end,
And discern their underlying *virtue/power* (造恩).
*Constructing virtue/power* means creating laws and teachings.
Thus, when the people know writing, *virtue/power* declines,
When they know calculation, benevolence declines,
When they know bonds and contracts, trust declines,
When they know tools and devices, substance declines.
These four arise only after *The Way* has been lost,
And measures are established according to the times.
The stricter the measures become,
The more they are violated—
Thus, trust and sincerity decline,
And cunning and deceit flourish.

The zither does not sound,
Yet its twenty-five strings each respond with their own tone;
The axle does not turn by itself,
Yet its thirty spokes each exert their force in rotation.
Strings have slackness and tightness,
Only then can they produce melody;
Carts have labor and rest,
Only then can they reach distant places.
Those who make sound do so without sound,
Those who make turning do so without turning—
The zither has no sound,
Yet sound resides in the strings;
The axle does not turn,
Yet turning resides in the wheels.
Thus, there is sound without sound,
And turning without turning—
Only then can melody be produced,
Only then can distant places be reached.

High and low follow different *Dao* (道):
If *The Way* is great yet the position is low, it brings disaster;
If *The Way* is small yet the task is great, it brings ruin.
A cap cannot be worn on the feet,
A subject cannot be honored above his lord.
When high and low are disordered,
Ruination comes without delay.

Small *virtue/power* harms righteousness,
Small goodness harms *The Way*,
Small argument harms governance,
Excessive strictness harms *virtue/power*.
To cling to minor kindness while obscuring *The Way*,
To indulge minor anger while harming supreme *virtue/power*—
Great governance is not harsh,
Thus the people are easily guided;
Supreme *virtue/power* is effortless,
Thus the lower ranks do not rebel.
Utmost loyalty returns to simplicity,
Thus the people have no deceit or concealment;
Above, there is fairness and rectitude,
Below, there is no treachery or guile;
Above, there is clarity and frugality,
Below, there is no craftiness or falsehood.

The Master Laozi said:
When the *law* of seating is established,
The common people grow resentful;
When the decree of demoting ranks is put forth,
Meritorious officials rebel.
Lawsuits proliferate and drag others into blame,
The innocent suffer their grievances;
Ranks are diminished and meritorious officials harbor resentment,
Thus they plot rebellion.
Those who examine only the traces of lawsuits
Do not know the root of order and chaos;
Those who are skilled in military formations
Do not know the strategies of decisive victory.
Order and chaos are determined by the transformation of *The Way* through non-action,
Not by the knowledge of officials who supervise and reprimand.
Decisive victory is achieved through insight in the mind’s realm,
Not by the understanding of a single soldier.
The Sage perceives blessings within fortified gates,
And foresees calamities in the unseen depths.
Within fortified gates and in unseen depths—
The Sage alone can discern the profound.

The foolish are bewildered by minor gains,
Yet forget the greater harm—
Thus, some *Dao* bring small profit yet great ruin,
Gain here yet lose there.
To see the small and forget the great,
To gain profit yet forget harm—
How deeply deluded are they!
How can they be led astray?

Thus, benevolence finds no greater expression than loving others,
Wisdom finds no greater depth than knowing others.
To love others as oneself,
Is to prevent unjust punishment;
To know others with sincerity,
Is to ensure governance remains unerring.

Loving others is like loving oneself,
Then punishment will not be excessive;
Knowing others with sincerity,
Then governance will not be disordered.

The Master Laozi said:
The vastness of the rivers and seas,
Though they overflow, does not last beyond three days;
A sudden gust of wind and torrential rain
Do not persist beyond a moment.
This shows that violent rule is brief,
And ruin comes swiftly—
Just as the wind rages fiercely,
Yet ceases just as quickly.

Those whose *virtue/power* has no foundation
Yet fear no ruin—
It is because they have not yet reached it.
Worry is the means of flourishing,
Joy is the means of ruin—
Thus, the good turn misfortune into blessing,
And the wise transform calamity into fortune.
*The Way* is boundless yet can be employed,
Yet never becomes full.
The foolish cling to delusion and do not turn back,
Taking worry as joy,
And thus meet swift ruin;
The good uphold *The Way* and preserve simplicity,
Transforming calamity into fortune,
And thus flourish without fail.

The Master Laozi said:
Serene stillness and tranquil harmony
Are the nature of humankind.
Ceremonial forms and rules
Are the measures of *Dao*.
To know the nature of others,
Is to cultivate oneself without contradiction;
To know the measures of *Dao*,
Is to ensure one’s actions are not disordered.
Tranquil harmony is the foundation of natural disposition,
Rules are the excess of restraining desire.
Drawn by desire and profit,
Even stillness becomes contradiction;
Clarity in *Dao* and measure,
Even movement remains unerring.

Issue a single command,
And all respond without contention—
This is called *The Way*.
To grasp the root and know the branches,
To hold one principle yet respond to all things—
This is called *skill*.
To issue a command means to prevent the heart from contention;
To prevent the heart from contention
Is to harmonize all actions and return to their foundation,
To respond to all things yet remain unified in *The Way*—
This is called *skill*.

To dwell knowing what to do,
To act knowing where to go,
To handle affairs knowing what to rely on,
To move knowing when to stop—
This is called *The Way*.

The Perfect Person acts and withdraws in due measure,
Knows when to embrace fortune and when to face misfortune—
If otherwise, how could they be said to follow *The Way*?

To make others praise and honor me as a lofty sage,
Is the strength of my heart;
To make others revile and slander me as lowly and base,
Is the fault of my heart.

Words issue from the mouth,
Yet cannot be restrained by others;
Actions arise from the near,
Yet cannot be restrained from afar.

Good and evil originate with oneself,
Praise and blame come from others—
What all mouths proclaim,
No one can suppress.

One flaw in conduct,
And its consequences reach far;
Matters are hard to complete yet easy to ruin,
Reputation is hard to establish yet easy to lose.
Ordinary folk all slight minor dangers,
Neglect small matters,
And thus invite great calamities.

For when disaster arrives,
It is self-generated;
When fortune comes,
It is self-created.
Disaster and fortune share the same threshold,
Benefit and harm dwell as neighbors—
Without the utmost discernment,
None can separate them.
Thus, deliberate consideration is the gateway to disaster and fortune,
Action and stillness are the pivot of benefit and harm—
They must not be overlooked.

The Perfect Person’s every action is deliberate,
And they measure the end from the beginning.

For where name and profit arise,
There too disaster and fortune take root.
Thus, to block the source of name and profit,
And seal the gate of disaster and fortune,
Is to let wisdom naturally unfold,
And to act and remain still without change.

Laozi said:
All know the mechanisms of order and chaos,
Yet none know how to preserve life whole.
Therefore, the sage assesses the world and acts accordingly,
Weighs affairs and plans accordingly.

The sage can be subtle and manifest,
Soft and firm,
Weak and strong—
They adapt to the times, moving or still,
And establish merit according to their resources.
They perceive things in their course
And know their reversals;
They embody *The Way* as their form,
And respond to its transformations.
Thus, they act throughout their life
Without ever being constrained.

All can grasp the principles of order and chaos,
Yet none can preserve themselves within their shifting currents.
Therefore, the sage assesses the world and weighs affairs,
Responds to endless changes,
Acts in accordance with the times,
And never suffers disgrace.

Thus, some matters may be spoken of yet cannot be done,
Some may be done yet cannot be spoken of,
Some are hard to complete yet easy to ruin.

What is done yet cannot be spoken of—
Taking and discarding.
What is spoken of yet cannot be done—
Deceit and trickery.
What is easy yet hard to complete—
Affairs.
What is hard to complete yet easy to ruin—
Reputation.
These four matters,
The sage attends to with care,
And the enlightened alone can truly perceive.

To examine the shifts of action and withdrawal,
And discern the causes of success and failure—
Only the sage and the wise can truly see.

Laozi said:
*The Way* of the common person is—
Their heart desires smallness,
Their ambition desires greatness,
Their wisdom desires completeness,
Their conduct desires rectitude,
Their capacity desires abundance,
Their undertakings desire fewness.

By "heart small" is meant—
To guard against disaster before it arises,
To be cautious of ruin in its minutiae,
And not to dare indulge their desires.

By "ambition great" is meant—
To encompass all under heaven,
To unify diverse customs,
And to gather the myriad judgments
As the hub of a wheel.

By "wisdom complete" is meant—
To know the end and the beginning without limit,
To let sound flow in all directions,
And to be like a deep spring never exhausted.

By "conduct rect" is meant—
To stand straight yet never bend,
To remain pure yet never stain,
To endure hardship without altering their principles,
And to achieve success without arrogance.

By "capacity abundant" is meant—
To possess both literary and martial arts,
To balance movement and stillness with propriety,
And to adapt every action to its fitting measure.

By "undertakings few" is meant—
To grasp the essential and align with the multitude,
To hold fast to the strict and govern the broad,
To maintain stillness amidst chaos.

Thus, the small-hearted are restrained by the minute,
The great-ambitioned embrace all without exception,
The wise-knowing lack no understanding,
The rect-conducted have nothing they refuse,
The abundant-capacityed govern all without flaw,
The few-undertakings hold what is essential.

All these qualities,
None but the most exalted sage and true adept can fully embody.

Thus, the sage’s approach to goodness—
No minor matter goes undone,
And to their faults—
No subtle error remains uncorrected.
They act without relying on shamans and sorcerers,
Yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before them—
This is the height of nobility.

Yet they tremble and guard themselves,
Each day more cautious than the last,
And thus achieve without doing.

Externally, they do not fail others,
Internally, they do not shame themselves—
Why need they summon shamans and sorcerers?
Why fear ghosts and spirits?
From their reverent and wounded heart,
They can be preserved to the end.

The fool’s wisdom is already meager,
Yet their undertakings are many—
Thus their actions must falter.
If they employ upright teachings,
It is easy and must succeed;
If they employ perverse teachings,
It is difficult and must fail.

To abandon what is easy yet certain to succeed,
And to pursue what is difficult yet certain to fail—
This is the path of folly and confusion.

Without measuring gain and loss,
One sits and invites peril and ruin.

When undertakings are manifold and difficult to govern,
Even toil will lead to defeat.

When things are simple and easily followed,
Yet one does not act—
This is the ultimate folly.

Laozi said:
*"Fortune arises softly and subtly,
While calamity erupts in tumultuous waves.
The patterns of fortune and misfortune
Are faint and unseen by the common eye.*

*The Sage perceives their beginning and end,
Thus one must not fail to observe them.*

*Fortune is as light as a feather—
Only the Sage discerns it;
Calamity looms like a great mountain—
The fool sees nothing of it.*

*The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments
Are not for himself alone,
But for the realm.
What benefits oneself yet serves no function for the state
Shall not be rewarded;
What harms oneself yet aids the state
Shall not be punished.
Thus the enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments
Rest upon impartial justice.*

*What benefits the state and aids the people—
Then it is done;
What profits oneself yet harms the people—
Then it is halted.*

*Therefore, righteousness lies in what is fitting—
This is called the gentleman.
To abandon what is fitting—
This is called the petty man.*

*Is there a fixed distinction between gentleman and petty man?
When actions and measures align with propriety—
Then one is a gentleman;
When conduct and use stray from due measure—
Then one is a petty man.*

*Those of supreme wisdom act without effort—
The highest sage attains effortless mastery.
The next toil without exhaustion—
The middle person strives without weariness.
The lowest labor without gain—
The vulgar, their minds dull and spirit bewildered,
Thus their toil grows ever heavier,
Their affliction ever deeper.*

*The ancients savored the Dao without clinging,
The moderns abandon it without tasting.
Not to cling—this is not dwelling.
To savor—this is savoring the Way.*

*The ancients savored the Dao without clinging,
The moderns, lacking the Way, yet boast of themselves.*

*Zhou’s tyrant made a ceremonial cap adorned with elephants,
And used ivory chopsticks—
Yet Ji Zi rejoiced,
For he delighted in its extravagant splendor."*

「The state of Lu buried its dead with *ou-ren*—
*Ou-ren*, carved wooden figures resembling humans, were used as ritual vessels of the covenant.
Yet Confucius sighed—
He lamented their lack of propriety.
Observing their origin,
One could discern their end.
The petty man, seeing the ceremonial cap adorned with elephants and the *ou-ren*,
Believed that in life they were honored,
And in death they were grandly treated;
The noble man, gazing upon them,
Knew that their Dao was in decline,
Their virtue/power extinguished.

Laozi said:
*"Ren"* is what people admire,
*"Yi"* is what people esteem.
To be admired by people,
To be esteemed by people,
Yet sometimes meet with death and the fall of one’s state,
Is because one does not conform to the times.
Thus, knowing *yi* yet not knowing the world’s power,
One does not grasp the Dao.
Merely extolling the seven virtues of *yi*,
Without recognizing the shifts of power and strategy,
Cannot avert ruin and downfall—
How could one be truly versed in the Way?

The Five Emperors valued virtue/power,
And ruled by non-action.
The Three Kings upheld *yi*,
And exterminated tyranny to bring peace to the people.
The Five Hegemons relied on strength,
Meaning they depended on the knowledge and force of arms.
Now, applying the methods of the Five Emperors to the age of the Five Hegemons,
Is not the proper Dao.
Thus, the wise vary their actions,
Not because praise is in fashion,
But because their conduct aligns with the times—
Success or failure depends on the left or right.

The times differ, so governance must change.
In the age of the Five Hegemons,
To practice the Dao of the Five Emperors,
Is like binding a pillar to a lute or treating thirst with hemlock—
Truly difficult indeed.

To know Heaven’s will,
To understand humanity’s ways,
Is to possess the means to navigate the world.
Navigating the world is the constant way.
To know Heaven yet not humanity,
Is to lack the means to engage with the common.
To know humanity yet not Heaven,
Is to lack the means to play with the Dao.

Knowing Heaven and humanity,
Knowing the common and the times,
One can govern the world,
And play with the Dao.

To follow one’s true intent and suit one’s nature,
The rigid and strong will oppose you,
And to serve others with one’s body,
The *yin-yang* forces will consume you.
To suit your own intent,
Is to go against their desires—
You must be opposed by the rigid and strong.
To yield to others,
Is to exhaust your body—
Like ice and fire attacking each other.
*Yin-yang* refers to agitation and calmness.

Those who attain the Dao,
Transform outwardly yet remain unaltered within.
Their outward transformation reveals humanity,
Their inner steadfastness preserves the self.
Thus, within they maintain a fixed principle,
While outwardly they bend and stretch,
Adjusting with the world—
Acting in all things without falling into error.
What is prized in the Dao,
Is its *longbian*—
Its boundless adaptability.

Those who attain the Dao,
In motion, they are Heaven itself;
In stillness, they are Earth.
Their motion and stillness suit the times—
Their withdrawal and engagement lie within themselves.
Thus, the common cannot harm them,
And the world cannot ensnare them.
Hence, when Confucius saw the Sage Lao,
Was he not like a dragon?
For his transformations knew no limits.
To uphold one principle,
To extend one method,
Even if success is achieved,
It remains unyielding—
Clinging to petty gains,
Yet obstructing the great Dao.
Once ensnared by one path,
How could one speak of the great Dao?

The Dao is serene and tranquil in its emptiness,
Not bound by action or affected by things.
It does not act upon things for its own sake—
Between self and things, the distinction is naturally dissolved;
In the stillness and serenity, one’s nature is spontaneously divine.

Thus, to undertake actions in accordance with the Dao,
Is not the doing of one who has attained the Dao—
It is the Dao’s own unfolding.
The Dao is fundamentally non-action,
Yet now it speaks of "accordance with the Dao"—
This is action itself.
Action brings about affairs,
Affairs bring about calamities.
Moreover, the Dao has no fixed appearance,
And affairs have no fixed order—
To act against the Dao’s flow,
Is to invite confusion and discord—
Then misfortune will surely arise.
Hence, it is said that this is not the doing of one who has attained the Dao.

*Shi* means to set up—
To establish external rules and measures,
Is the Dao’s ceremonial form,
Not its true substance—
One cannot cling to it.
To cling is to lose it,
To act upon it is to fail.
The principle can be made clear.

The heavens and earth cover and load all things,
The sun and moon illuminate and clarify them,
The yin and yang nurture them,
The rain and dew nourish them,
The **Dao** and **virtue** sustain and uphold them—
All are spoken of as **one harmony**.

Hence, he who can bear the Great Circle walks the Great Square—
That is, the person who bears the heavens and walks the earth.
He who gazes upon the Great Clarity beholds the Great Brightness—
That is, the person who sees the sun and moon.
He who establishes the Great Peace dwells in the Great Hall—
That is, the person who abides in the cosmos between.

He who can wander in the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),
Shares light with the sun and moon,
Gives rise without form to what is formed—
Thus, the **True Person** entrusts himself to the **Spiritual Platform** (*lingtai*), and returns to the origin.
He reverses what has not yet been born.

To gaze upon the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),
To listen in the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),
Within the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*),
Alone there is **awareness** (*xiao*),
Within the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),
Alone there is **illumination** (*zhao*).

It is said that the **True Person** amid the heavens and earth,
Beholding the sun and moon’s light,
Wandering in the Great Peace—
Then where does he not find **suitability** (*shi*)?
Dwelling in the Great Hall,
Yet nothing is excluded from the **succinct** and **profound** (*suoyin*) within;
**Awareness** (*xiao*) in the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*),
And all sounds respond within the **silent** and **void** (*wusheng*);
**Illumination** (*zhao*) in the **formless** (*wuxing*),
Yet all forms appear—
Then he preserves with the heavens and earth,
Shares brightness with the sun and moon,
Deposits himself in the **Spiritual Platform** (*lingtai*),
Encompasses the **ultimate essence** (*zhi jing*),
And is called the **True Person**.

His **use** is to **not use**,
To **not use** is to **then be able to use**;
His **knowing** is to **not know**,
To **not know** is to **then be able to know**—
This has already been expounded.

The **Dao** is the **Way** by which things are guided,
**Virtue** (*de*) is the support by which life is sustained,
**Ren** (*benevolence*) is the **manifestation** of accumulated **en** (*favor/grace*),
**Yi** (*righteousness*) is the **harmonization** of personal **heart** with the **suitable** for all—
These four are the **principles** by which one governs the world and cultivates oneself,
And they must not be lost.

When the **Dao** is extinguished, **virtue** (*de*) flourishes;
When **virtue** (*de*) declines, **ren** and **yi** arise.
Thus, in the **upper ages**, the **Dao** was followed without **virtue** (*de*),
In the **middle ages**, **virtue** (*de*) was upheld without **ren** and **yi**,
In the **lower ages**, **ren** and **yi** were enforced with fear of losing them—
Hence, the **Noble Person** cannot live without **yi** (*righteousness*), for to lose **yi** is to lose the means of living;
The **petty person** cannot survive without **li** (*profit*), for to lose **li** is to lose the means of survival.

The **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,
The **petty person** desires **li** as **blessing**—
Observing their fears,
The paths to **calamity** and **blessing** diverge.

When the **Dao** is lost and **virtue** (*de*) declines,
The seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) are slighted and **righteousness** (*yi*) grows thin.
The **Noble Person** without **yi** has no way to preserve his **Dao**,
The **petty person** without **li** has no way to sustain his life.
The **Noble Person** fears losing **yi** as a **calamity**,
The **petty person** seeks **li** as **blessing**.

The **Laozi** said:
Some desire **profit** (*li*) and thereby harm **righteousness** (*yi*),
Some desire to harm **righteousness** (*yi*) and thereby bring **profit** (*li*).
To feed a **disease** of dampness with **heat**,
To quench a **disease** of thirst with **coldness**—
This is how the multitude **nourishes** (*yang*) their **ailments** (*bing*),
Yet the **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **causing harm**.

Pleasure to the eyes,
Delight to the heart—
What the **foolish** (*yu*) find **profitable** (*li*),
The **Daoist** (*youdao*) avoids.
The **Sage** governs by **first establishing** and **then harmonizing**,
The multitude by **first harmonizing** and **then establishing**—
Thus, the gates of **calamity** and **blessing**,
The **reversal** of **profit** and **harm**,
Cannot be overlooked.

To quench a **disease** of thirst with **water**,
The **skilled physician** (*liangyi*) knows this as **calamity**.
The **poor** take **wealth** from **unrighteousness** (*buyi*),
The **Noble Person** knows this as **harm**.
**First opposing** and **then harmonizing**—
This is the **error** the **foolish** (*yu*) commit;
**First harmonizing** and **then opposing**—
This is what the **Sage** abhors.

**Profit** and **harm** are contrary,
**Calamity** and **blessing** are inverted—
One must not fail to discern them.

The **Laozi** said:
Those with **achievements** (*gong*) who abandon **ren** and **yi** will be **suspected**,
Those with **guilt** (*zui*) who uphold **ren** and **yi** will be **trusted**.
Hence, **ren** and **yi** are the **constant harmony** of affairs,
And the **most honored** (*zun*) **rank** in the world—
Though **achievements** (*gong*) and **names** (*ming*) are already established,
The seven **virtues** (*qi yi*) must not be forsaken.
To forsake them invites **guilt** to accumulate,
To follow them ensures **rank** and **reward** are honored.

Though one’s **plans** (*mou*) are **correct** and **strategies** (*ji*) are **apt**,
And **worries** (*lü*) are **dispelled** by **schemes** (*tuo*),
If the state is preserved,
Yet one’s affairs **depart** from **ren** and **yi**,
Then one’s **achievements** (*gong*) will surely **not be fulfilled**.

Though one’s **calculations** (*ji*) are **not flawed**,
Yet one’s **strategies** (*ji*) are **no benefit** to the state,
If one’s **heart** is **complete** toward the **lord** (*jun*),
And **harmonizes** with **ren** and **yi**,
Then one’s **life** will surely be **preserved**.

Hence it is said:
A hundred **words** and a hundred **calculations** that are **never apt** (*bu ru bangqi*),
Are not as good as **abandoning** (*she*) them and **tending** (*qu*) to **ren** and **yi**.

As a **minister** to the **lord** (*jun*),
One who **plans** for the state’s **difficulties** (*nan*),
**Exalts** the **lord** and **honors** himself,
Yet **achievements** (*gong*) are **not completed**—
This is due to **abandoning** **ren** and **yi**.

Some have **wise counsel** (*liangmou*) yet it is **not used**,
**Unusual strategies** (*qiji*) yet they **do not proceed**,
They **serve** the **lord** with all their **strength** (*jin*),
Though **not observed** (*bujiancha*),
They **preserve** **ren** and **yi** without **daring** to **forget** them even for a moment,
And thus their **lives** are **without harm**.

The **Laozi** said:
**Teaching** originates with the **Noble Person**,
The **petty person** benefits from its **radiance** (*ze*).
**Profit** originates with the **petty person**,
The **Noble Person** **enjoys** its **achievements** (*gong*).
If the **Noble Person** and **petty person** each **obtain** their **proper place** (*yi*),
Then **achievements** and **rewards** are **shared** (*tonggong yishi*), and the **Dao** is **realized**.

**Virtue’s** (*de*) **radiance** (*ze*) extends downward,
**Rewards** and **profits** are **bestowed** upward—
Then there are **no officials** yet **governance** is **self-regulating**,
No **commands** yet **actions** are **self-executing**,
Each **dwells** in **their proper place** (*an qi suo*),
And this is the **realization** of the **Dao**.

**Desire** in excess **injures** **righteousness** (*yi*),
**Worry** in excess **harms** **wisdom** (*zhi*),
**Desire** gives rise to **righteousness** being **seized** (*yi duo*),
**Worry** accumulates **wisdom** being **obscured** (*zhi hun*).
Hence, a state **delighted** in **profit** (*li*) will **surely** be **preserved**,
A state **delighted** in **harm** (*shang*) will **surely** be **destroyed**—
**Indulging** its **desires** (*zong qi yu*).

Water flows downward and **becomes vast** (*guangda*),
The **lord** (*jun*) **subordinates** himself to the **minister** (*chen*) and **becomes wise** (*congming*),
The **lord** does not **contend** with the **minister**,
And thus the **Way** of **governance** (*treat*) is **unimpeded**—
Hence, the **lord** is the **root and foundation** (*genben*),
The **minister** is the **branches and leaves** (*zhi ye*),
And if the **root and foundation** are **not beautiful** yet the **branches and leaves** flourish—
This has never occurred.

The **Sage’s** (*shengren*) **governance** (*zhi*) is:
To **illuminate** the **four eyes** (*ming si mu*),
To **penetrate** the **four ears** (*da si cong*),
To **exclude** the **wicked** and **depraved** (*ping yie te*),
To **employ** the **virtuous** and **capable** (*ren sheneng*),
Then the **lord** above **hangs** (*chui*) and **does nothing** (*wuwei*) while **transformation** (*hua*) occurs naturally—
And the **ministers** below **exert** their **hearts** (*xin*) fully while **dutifully** (*fengzhi*) **serving**.

How could there be **mutual contention** (*jiaozheng*)?
This is the **root and foundation** **ever-firm** (*ri gu*),
And the **branches and leaves** **prolific** (*fansheng*).

The **Laozi** said:
The **loving father’s** (*ci fu*) **care** for his **son** (*zi*) is,
Not seeking **recompense** (*bao*),
Yet **cannot** be **internally resolved** (*nei jie*) in the **heart**.
The **Sage lord’s** (*sheng zhu*) **nourishment** (*yang*) of the **people** (*min*) is,
Not for **selfish use** (*ji yong*),
Yet **nature** (*xing*) **cannot** be **restrained** (*bu neng yi*).
When one **relies** on their **strength** (*li*),
And **depends** on their **achievements** (*gong*),
Yet **must** **exhaust** (*qiong*) **all** for **reward** (*wei*),
Then **favor** (*en*) **does not reach** (*bu jie*).
The **father’s** **care** for his **son**,
The **lord’s** **shepherding** of the **people**—
How could they **seek** **recompense**?

The **partition of nature** is the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** (*Tian Dao*).

Should any **lord or father** **rely** on their **strength** (*li*) and **achievements** (*gong*), and **grow arrogant** toward their **subjects or children** (*ci fu*), then **favor** (*en*) **does not reach** (*bu jie*).

Thus, **employing** what the **common people** (*zhong ren*) **love**,
One **gains** the **common people’s** **strength** (*li*),
**Elevating** what the **common people** **delight** in (*ju*),
One **gains** the **common people’s** **heart** (*xin*).
Thus, **seeing** their **beginning** (*shu*),
One **knows** their **end** (*zhong*).
**Compassionately loving** all **under Heaven** (*tian xia*), though **Heaven** be vast (*qian wei*),
All become **members of one family** (*ju wei yi jia*);
**Not loving** all **under Heaven**,
Even the **lowliest individual** (*pi fu*), though **mighty insignificant** (*qian wei*),
Yet **remains** an **enemy** to all **lands** (*wan fang*).
By this **perspective** (*guan*),
Then **end and beginning** may be **known** (*zhi zhong shi ke zhi*),
And **life and death** may be **discerned** (*cun wang ke cha*).

The **Laozi** said:
When **people** **love** with **righteousness** (*yi*),
**Factions** **strengthen** through **group bonds** (*dang yi qun qiang*),
Thus, **where virtue/power** (*de*) **is applied** (*shi*),
If **broad** (*bo*),
Then **where the influence** (*wei*) **of authority** (*zhi*) **extends**,
It **reaches far** (*shi xing zhi yuan*),
If **righteousness** (*yi*) **is bestowed** (*jia*) **sparingly** (*bo*),
Then **what is subdued by force** (*wu zhi zhi xiao*) **remains small** (*shi xiao*).
This **speaks** of **virtue/power’s** **bounty** being **without partiality** (*wu si*),
And **those who adhere** (*fu*) **being many** (*zhi zhong*),
If **righteousness** is **abandoned** and **force** is **employed** (*qi yi yong wu*),
Then **what is preserved** (*zhi cun*) **is few** (*zhi shao*).

This **refers** to **acquiring** without **righteousness** (*yi*),
Yet **not distributing** (*bu shu*),
**Calamity** (*huan*) **will come** to their **person** (*shi*),
**Unable** to **benefit** others (*bu neng wei ren*),
Yet **also unable** to **benefit themselves** (*bu neng zi wei*),
**Such may be called** a **foolish person** (*yu ren*),
**No different** from the **owl** (*xiao*) **loving** its **young** (*zi*).
**Taking** without **righteousness** (*qi yi bu yi*),
**Accumulating** yet **not dispersing** (*ji er bu san*),
This is the **so-called** *"nurturing the tiger only to become its prey"* (*yang hu zi di*) and *"rearing the owl only to meet its doom"* (*yu xiao zi bi*).

Thus, **holding** yet **preparing** (*bei*) **is not as good** as **abandoning** (*zhi ji*),
**Hoarding** yet **sharpening** (*cui*) **cannot long endure** (*bu neng chang bao*).
Yet **even** a **treasure chest** (*ju gu*) or **woven basket** (*xiang lao*),
**Will ultimately** become **the resource** (*zi*) **of great thieves** (*da dao*).
How could it **long persist** (*chang you*)?

**Virtue/power** (*de*) **contains** the **Dao/Way** (*dao*),
The **Dao/Way** (*dao*) **contains** **virtue/power** (*de*),
Its **transformation** (*hua*) **cannot be exhausted** (*ji*).
**Those** with the **Dao/Way** **must** have **virtue/power** (*you dao zhi bi you de*).
**Those** with **virtue/power** **must** have the **Dao/Way** (*you de zhi bi you dao*).
When **virtue/power** and the **Dao/Way** are **fully realized** (*chong bei*),
They **harmonize** with **limitless change** (*yong bian hua wu ji*).

**Yin** contains **Yang** (*yin zhong you yang*),
**Yang** contains **Yin** (*yang zhong you yin*),
All **affairs** (*wan shi*) **thus follow** (*jin ran*),
**Cannot be fully illuminated** (*bu ke sheng ming*).
When **auspicious fortune** (*fu*) **arrives** and **blessing** (*xiang*) **is preserved** (*cun*),
When **calamity** (*huo*) **arrives** and **blessing** (*xiang*) **comes first** (*xian*),
**Seeing** **blessing** yet **acting wickedly** (*wei bu shan*),
Then **auspicious fortune** **will not come** (*fu bu lai*),
**Seeing** **inauspiciousness** (*bu xiang*) yet **acting virtuously** (*xing shan*),
Then **calamity** **will not arrive** (*huo bu zhi*).
**Benefit** and **harm** share the **same gate** (*tong men*),
**Calamity** and **fortune** are **neighbors** (*tong lin*),
**Only** the **divine and sagely** (*shen sheng*) **can distinguish** (*mo zhi neng fen*).
Thus it is said:
**Calamity** (*huo*), **auspicious fortune**’s **leaning** (*fu xiang yi*),
**Auspicious fortune** (*fu*), **calamity**’s **hidden presence** (*huo xiang fu*),
Who **knows** its **limit** (*shi*)?
This **speaks** of **Yin** containing **Yang**,
And **Yang** containing **Yin**,
Meaning **fortune** contains **calamity**,
And **calamity** contains **fortune**.

If one **sees** **fortune** yet **considers** it **auspicious** (*xiang*),
Then one **knows** **fortune** as the **beginning** of **calamity** (*huo shi*).
If one **sees** **calamity** yet **immediately** **considers** it **good** (*shan*),
Then one **knows** **calamity** as the **prelude** to **fortune** (*fu xian*).
The **arrival** of **calamity** and **fortune** (*huo fu zhi lai*),
**Is like** **twining strands** (*jiao chan*),
**Only** the **most sagely** (*zhi sheng*) **can know** their **limit** (*ji*).

When **people** are **about to fall ill** (*jiang ji*),
They **must first** **relish** the **flavor** of **fish and meat** (*gan yu rou zhi wei*).
When a **country** is **about to perish** (*jiang wang*),
They **must first** **abhor** the **words** of **loyal ministers** (*wu zhong chen zhi yu*).
**The sick** (*ren bing*),
**Indulge** their **mouth** (*gan qi kou*),
**Delight** in **tastes** (*mei qi wei*),
**This is a sign** of **certain death** (*bi si zhi zheng*).
**The disordered** (*guo luan*),
**Abhor** **loyal counsel** (*wu zhong yan*),
**Believe** **deceitful speech** (*xin yi shuo*),
**This is a sign** of **certain ruin** (*bi wang zhi zhao*).

Thus, **when one is near death** (*ren jiang si*),
**Even** if the **physician** be **skilled** (*yi shi liang*),
They **cannot** be **saved** (*mo jiu*).
When a **country** is **near ruin** (*guo jiang wang*),
**Even** if the **loyalist** **be thorough** (*zhong jin*),
They **cannot** be **preserved** (*nan cun*).
**Only** the **skilled physician** and **loyal minister** (*wei liang yi zhong chen*),
**Can discern** the **certain death** yet **not treat** (*shen bi si er bu jiu*),
**Can observe** the **preservable** yet **advise** (*cha ke cun er wei mou*).
**Refine** it in **oneself** (*xiu zhi shen*),
Then one **may govern** the **people** (*cai yi zhi min*).
**Rule** the **household** and **govern** the **country** (*ju jia li zhi*),
Then one **may** **transfer** their **care** to the **royal court** (*ke yi yi chang*).

Thus it is said:
**Refine** it in **oneself** (*xiu zhi shen*),
Then their **virtue/power** (*de*) **becomes genuine** (*nai zhen*).
**Refine** it in the **family** (*xiu zhi jia*),
Then their **virtue/power** **has surplus** (*nai you yu*).
**Refine** it in the **country** (*xiu zhi guo*),
Then their **virtue/power** **becomes abundant** (*nai fei yong*).
By **oneself** **observing** others (*yong shen guan bi*),
And **the family** **governing** the **country** (*zi jia xing guo*),
The **essence** lies in **refining oneself** (*zhi yao xiu shen*),
And **preserving virtue/power** (*zai yu quan de*).

**People’s** **means** of **livelihood** (*shi*) **are** **clothing** and **food** (*yi yu shi*).
If **service** (*shi*) **is thorough** in **clothing** and **food** (*zhi yu yi shi*),
Then there **is merit** (*you gong*),
If **service** is **not thorough** (*bu zhou*),
Then there **is no merit** (*wu gong*).
When **service** **lacks merit** (*wu gong*),
Then **virtue/power** **does not endure** (*de bu chang*).
**Clothing** and **food** are the **vitality** (*ming*) of the **common people** (*fu shi zhi ming*).
The **common people** are the **foundation** (*ben*) of **lord and subject** (*jun chen*).
When **clothing** and **food** are **thorough** for **oneself** (*zhi yu yi shi*),
Then **lord and subject** **are long preserved** in the **country** (*chang bao yu guo*).

Thus, **conforming** to the **times** (*su shi*) yet **not succeeding** (*wu cheng*),
**Do not alter** their **laws** (*wu geng qi xing*),
**Following** the **times** (*shun shi*) yet **not succeeding**,
**Do not alter** their **governance** (*wu geng er li*).
When the **times** **will rise again** (*shi jiang fu qi*),
This is called the **principle of the Dao/Way** (*dao ji*).

The **times** have **flourishings** and **declines** (*xing fu shi*),
The **course** has **prosperity** and **adversity** (*yun you xiang pi*).
**One cannot** **use** the **excessive governance** of **past times** (*qian shi zhi fan zhi*) **as** the **essential principles** of the **present age** (*jin shi zhi yao li*).
This **speaks** of **laws** **not being abandoned** (*xing bu ke fei*),
And **governance** **not being altered** (*li bu ke yi*).
If one **can discern** this (*neng zhi yu ci*),
Then they **grasp** the **framework of the Dao/Way** (*dao zhi ji gang*).

The **Emperor** and **King** **enrich** their **people** (*fu qi min*),
This is **strengthening** their **foundation** (*dun qi ben*).

The **Conqueror and King** enrich their **lands**—
This is **pursuing** their **expansion** (*wu qi guang ye*).
A **perilous state** enriches its **officials**—
**Heavy taxation** leads only to **hardship**.
To **govern** a **state** yet **lack sufficiency**,
To **pacify** **chaos** yet **lack sufficiency**—
This is the **omen** of **impending disorder**.
A **doomed state** **empties** its **granaries**.
**Expenditures** **without measure**,
Granaries **daily depleted**,
The **ruler** **impoverished**, the **people** **exhausted**—
What **awaits** it if it does not **perish**?

Thus it is said:
When the **sage-ruler** does **nothing** (*wu wei*),
The **people** **prosper** of themselves;
When the **sage-ruler** **acts not** (*wu wei*),
The **people** **transform** of themselves.
**Settle** their **dwellings**,
**Delight** in their **labors**.
Raise an **army** of **ten thousand**,
**Daily** consuming **a thousand** in **gold**—
After the **campaign’s** end,
**Famine** **must** follow.
Thus **arms** are the **ominous tool**,
Not the **treasure** of the **noble**.

When **warfare** **arises** in **front**,
**Famine** **follows** in **rear**;
The **state** **spends** **ten thousand** in **gold**,
The **people** **exhausted** by **toil**.
Thus it is known:
The **ominous tool** is **not** the **treasure** of the **sage**.

To **conciliate** **great grievances** **must** **leave** **residual grievances**—
How can this be **not evil**?
He who **conciliates grievances** is one whose **ruler** is **unclear**.
To **demote** a **meritorious minister**,
To **diminish** a **virtuous lord**,
To **not endure** a **moment’s anger**,
Yet **make** it a **source of calamity**.
When the **ruler’s wrath** **flares above**,
And the **minister’s pride** **smolders below**—
How can this be **not evil**, **accumulating** **residual grievances**?

In **ancient times**, the **near** were **not** **summoned** by **words**,
The **distant** were **not** **commanded** by **words**.
The **near** **take delight**,
The **distant** **come**.
To **delight the near** and **attract the distant**—
This lies in **virtue**, not in **words**.

To **share desire** with the **people** is to **harmonize**,
To **share defense** with the **people** is to **strengthen**,
To **share thought** with the **people** is to **know** them.
He who **gains the people’s strength** is **rich**,
He who **gains the people’s praise** is **illustrious**.

**Actions** **invite bandits**,
**Words** **bring calamity**.
Do not **speak before others**,
Nor **follow after others** have spoken.
**Whispered words**—
These are **transmitted**.
**Spoken first**, then **repeated** to the **ears**—
**Echoing** a **thousand li**.
**Speech** is **calamity**,
The **tongue** is the **trigger**.
Once **words** are **ill-spoken**,
**Four horses cannot** **retrieve** them.
Bandits **love** what is **loved**,
Calamity **arises** from what is **spoken**.
Yet **speech** **runs** **without feet**,
**Flies** **without wings**—
The **blemish** on **white jade**,
**Four horses cannot** **pursue** it.
Thus **speech’s** **swift calamity**.

In **ancient times**, **Zhonghuangzi** said:
The **Heaven** has **five directions**—
**Four directions** and the **center**.
The **Earth** has **five phases**—
**Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth**.
**Sound** has **five tones**—
**Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, Yu**.
**Flavors** have **five tastes**—
**Sweet, Bitter, Spicy, Sour, Salty**.
**Colors** have **five hues**—
**Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Black**.
**Humans** have **five organs**—
The **five viscera**.

Thus between **Heaven and Earth** there are **twenty-five kinds** of **people**.
Twenty-five **ranks** of **human kind**—
Each **type** **differs**.

The **upper five** are:
**Divine Persons, True Persons, Dao-Persons, Perfect Persons, Sage-Persons**—
**Unfathomable transformation** is called **Divine**,
**Pure and unadulterated** is called **True**,
**Unobstructed penetration** is called **Dao**,
**Piercing the profound mysteries** is called **Perfect**,
**Knowledge encompassing all things** is called **Sage**.

The **next five** are:
**Virtuous Persons, Exemplary Persons, Wise Persons, Benevolent Persons, Eloquent Persons**—
**Nurturing** is called **Virtue**,
**Loved by others** is called **Exemplary**,
**Clear and insightful** is called **Wise**,
**Compassionate and forgiving** is called **Benevolent**,
**Persuasive in speech** is called **Eloquent**.

The **middle five** are:
**Public Persons, Loyal Persons, Trustworthy Persons, Righteous Persons, Ceremonious Persons**—
**Without self-interest** is called **Public**,
**Serving the ruler** is called **Loyal**,
**Without fault** is called **Trustworthy**,
**Appropriate conduct** is called **Righteous**,
**Respectful and yielding** is called **Ceremonious**.

The **next five** are:
**Scholar-Persons, Artisan-Persons, Park-Keepers, Farmers, Merchants**—
**Serving superiors** is the **Scholar**,
**Overseeing tools** is the **Artisan**,
**Managing forests and marshes** is the **Park-Keeper**,
**Cultivating fields** is the **Farmer**,
**Facilitating trade** is the **Merchant**.

The **lower five** are:
**Common Persons, Slave-Persons, Foolish Persons, Sensual Persons, Petty Persons**—
**Multitude** is the **Common**,
**Subjugation** is the **Slave**,
**Obtuse** is the **Foolish**,
**Without wisdom** is the **Sensual**,
**Without discernment** is the **Petty**.

The **upper five** and the **lower five**—
Like **humans** and **oxen/horses**.
**Exemplary and foolish** **differ**—
As **Heaven and Earth** are **separated**.

The **Sage**—
**Sees** with **eyes**,
**Hears** with **ears**,
**Speaks** with **mouth**,
**Acts** with **feet**.
The **Sage in the world**—
**Six senses** **obstructed**,
Yet **still relies** on **artifice**.

The **True Person**—
**Sees without clarity** yet is **clear**,
**Hears without listening** yet is **acute**,
**Moves without action** yet is **followed**,
**Speaks without words** yet is **public**.
The **Sage beyond the world**—
**The heart already emptied**,
**No obstruction in passage**.

Thus the **Sage’s** **movement** through the **world**—
The **True Person** **never exceeds** it;
The **Exemplary’s** **correction** of **customs**—
The **Sage** **never observes** it.

To **govern the age** and **preserve the True**—
Each **fulfills its role**.
Thus **Emperor Yao’s** **sage-virtue** **matched Heaven**,
And **Zhongwu’s** **lofty rectitude** **corrected customs**.

The **Dao**—
**No before, no after**,
**No left, no right**,
**All things** in **profound unity**,
**Neither this nor that**.

**Approach it**—**no before**,
**Follow it**—**no after**,
Who **knows its left**?
Who **knows its right**?
**Erased** in **profound unity**—
**Forcibly named** as **Dao**.

**The *Zhenxuan Zhengjing*** **ends** here.
