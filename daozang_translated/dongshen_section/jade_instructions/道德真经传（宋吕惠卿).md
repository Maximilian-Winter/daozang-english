# 道德真经传（宋吕惠卿)

**Preface to the *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***

Your subject Huiqing respectfully states: I have heard that when Cook Ding presented his blade, he attained the art of nurturing life before Lord Wenhui; when Wheelwright Bian laid down his chisel, he debated the reading of books before Duke Huan of Qi. If one’s aspiration remains undivided, the Dao may yet be found.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow my head again and again.

I humbly observe that the great system has scattered amid the falsity of cleverness, and all living beings have lost their original nature and emotions. Thus arose the True Person, who illuminated the supreme teaching, tracing its origin solely to the Dao and its virtue, and venerating the ancient canons. Hence, when Zhuang Zhou spoke of the age when "chickens and dogs could be heard" in one another’s villages, he referred to the time of Shennong and before; when the *Classic of Master Lie* declared the "Valley Spirit never dies," it attributed the work to the Yellow Emperor. Probing its subtle words, one finds wondrous things within. Vague and indistinct, they elude sight and hearing; neither ancient nor modern, their beginning and end defy comprehension. To lose them is to drift ever farther, like the supreme treasure hidden on Mount Ke, unknown to all; to grasp them is to have them come unbidden, like the Dark Pearl sought through *Xiangwang* and thus obtained.

The land of Huaxu visited by the Yellow Emperor, the Mount Gushe of Tang Yao—both mark the utmost journeys, leading to perfect tranquility. The intent of this book differs not from such attainments. When Cao Can studied under Master Gai and governed Qi, when Emperor Wen of Han transmitted the teachings of the *Heshang* and founded his dynasty, they grasped but the surface, yet still approached peace and prosperity.

Alas, vulgar learning fails to recognize the truth of the Dao. It sees only that the text differs from the traces of the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, unaware that its meaning is the very foundation of emperors and kings. Thus, when it hears "not exalting the worthy," it assumes they are abandoned in the wild; when it reads "not prizing goods," it thinks they are cast aside unused. It takes "abolishing learning" to mean ignorance like that of beasts and calves, and "abolishing sageliness" to mean lawlessness like that of primordial chaos. It does not know that within the numinous chamber, even gold dust, if left to accumulate, will dim the radiance of the spirit. Therefore, the book casts aside both good and evil to reach the ultimate unity of emptiness and tranquility. Such depths are hard to fathom, and rightly so—it befuddles the wise.

Thus, these trustworthy words of the sagely one have been ranked among the treasured teachings of the Hundred Schools. To expound this subtle learning should be the task of the most divine.

I prostrate myself before Your Imperial Majesty, who, possessing the essence of a perfected transcendent, has emerged to serve as sovereign and teacher, and whose overflowing marvelous root has taken form in great undertakings. You have rectified governance so that all affairs flourish, and reformed the age so that the Four Quarters place their trust in you. Now, you will align heart and form, shedding the burdens of governing things and nurturing the self; you will deepen the root and strengthen the stem to enter the gate of long life and enduring vision. You will unite the world with the land of Huaxu and behold the divine person on Mount Gushe. To reach the utmost of this attainment is most fitting for this time.

Your subject, by nature dull and ignorant, was born to endure hardship. Ever aspiring to the clarity of dawn, I sought to dispel the obstinacy of Heaven. Casting my gaze widely, I examined its scattered and disparate aspects, then pared them away to seek their underlying unity. Time has been insufficient, and years have passed thus. Only lately, in these writings, have I suddenly felt as though I had gained something. Moving toward stillness, the myriad things return to their root; from turbidity to clarity, the dark center reveals the dawn. Thus, I have expressed my understanding in words. Though I call this self-contentment, I know not if it is fitting.

I humbly regard the tranquil insight of the perfected person as the primal mirror for scholars. Daring to presume upon your attention, I offer this to discern its worth. Like the dragon’s scattered chapters, it is difficult to know its ascent to Heaven; yet, as the horse’s focused intelligence may grasp the Dao through debate, if even a single word proves of use, I would not shrink from ten thousand deaths.

The work I have composed, *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, comprises four fascicles. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial and submit it for your consideration.

Your subject Huiqing, with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head again and again and respectfully speaks.

First month of the first year of the Yuanfeng reign,

**Volume One: Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (The Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)**

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.

The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.

Ever without desire, one beholds its subtlety;
Ever with desire, one beholds its penetration.

These two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—
both are called the Mysterious.
The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
the gateway through which all subtleties emerge.

The Commentary states:
Of all the Dao in the world that can be spoken,
none is not the Dao—
yet when it is spoken, it is perilous;
thus it is the *non-eternal* Dao.

Of all the names in the world that can be named,
none is not the *order*—
yet when it is named, it is abandoned;
thus it is the *non-eternal* Name.

All things flourish in their profusion,
each returning to its root—
yet they do not know it as *stillness*.
Stillness is called *returning to the primal command*;
returning to the primal command is called *constancy*.

When one attains the Dao to *constancy*,
the mind congeals, the form dissolves,
and self and objects are both forgotten—
who then knows the Dao that can be spoken
or the Name that can be named?

Thus, the eternal Dao is indeed unspeakable,
and so it is said:
*"The Dao endures long,
and those who cling to it perish not."*

The eternal Name is indeed unnameable,
and so it is said:
*"From ancient times to today,
its Name does not fade."*

Neither perishing nor fading—
this is called the eternal Dao.

The eternal Dao is without Name,
and the Nameless is the Dao—
the origin from which Heaven and Earth first arose.
Thus it is said:
*"The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth."*

At the *Great Beginning*, there was the *Non-Being of Being*,
and there was the *Nameless*.
The *Non-Being of Being* cannot be obtained,
yet the *Nameless* is where the One arises—
the One before form took shape.

Once called the *One*,
though formless, it already bore a Name.
The Name is *One*,
yet the one who names is *Two*—
Two and One make *Three*,
and from this, all things proliferate.
Thus it is said:
*"The Named is the mother of all things."*

To know *constancy* is to be enlightened—
enlightenment means seeing all things.
Thus, only *constancy* can be observed.

When without desire,
the mind is pure, the vision profound, and flawless—
here one beholds its subtlety,
and so it is said:
*"Ever without desire,
one may name its smallness."*

When with desire,
all things arise in profusion—
here one beholds its penetration,
and so it is said:
*"All things return to it,
yet they know no master—
one may name its greatness."*

Only through the small does one perceive its subtlety,
only through the great does one perceive its penetration.

These two, though issuing from the same source,
differ only in name.
Their names differ,
yet their essence does not truly differ.
If their essence does not truly differ,
then seeking their source—
desire and non-desire—
both cannot be obtained.

If they cannot be obtained,
then their source is the same—
thus they are called the Mysterious.

The Mysterious as black aligns with red in unity;
Heaven’s hue is Mysterious—
yin and yang are one in unity.
Names arise from the Mysterious—
desire and non-desire are one in unity.

Unity is indeed subtle,
yet subtle in unity is not yet subtle in multiplicity,
subtle in self is not yet subtle in things.

The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
then even the same cannot be obtained.
If the same cannot be obtained,
then One and Many, Self and Things—
all are subtly manifest.

The subtlety of all things arises from this alone,
and so it is said:
*"The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—
the gateway through which all subtleties emerge."*

**Chapter Two: "When the World Knows Beauty"**

When the world knows beauty as beauty,
then ugliness already exists;
when it knows goodness as goodness,
then wickedness already exists.

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
difficulty and ease complete each other,
long and short define each other,
high and low balance each other,
harmony and discord resonate together,
before and after follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
teaches without speech.
All things arise without resistance,
are born without possession,
are shaped without reliance,
and when the work is done, takes no credit.
Only because they do not take credit
does it not depart from them.

The Commentary states:
When the world knows beauty as beauty and desires it,
knows ugliness and wickedness as such and rejects them—
yet speaking of them apart from the Dao,
even beauty and goodness are distant from the Dao.
Speaking of them arising from the Dao,
even ugliness and wickedness are not outside the Dao.

Thus observed,
beauty becomes ugliness,
goodness becomes wickedness—
is this not true?

Therefore, all things in the world arise from *being*,
and *being* arises from *non-being*—
this is called the *interdependence of being and non-being*.

Difficult tasks arise from ease,
yet ease also arises from difficulty—
thus there is no difficulty,
and this is called the *completion of ease and difficulty*.

When one knows the crane’s long stride,
only then does one know the hare’s short step;
when one knows the hare’s short step,
only then does one know the crane’s long stride—
this is called the *definition of long and short*.

If high is taken as correct,
then all valleys are the source of rivers—
highness has what to lean upon low,
and if low is taken as correct,
then rivers are the destination of all valleys—
low has what to lean upon high—
this is called the *balance of high and low*.

The yellow bell as master harmonizes the other tones,
the other tones as master harmonize the yellow bell—
this is called the *resonance of sounds*.

From autumn and winter, one looks to spring and summer—
then spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow;
from spring and summer, one looks to autumn and winter—
then autumn and winter come first, spring and summer follow—
this is called the *sequence of before and after*.

All these six pairs,
when in their proper time and place,
the world calls them *beautiful* and *good*;
when out of time and place,
the world calls them *ugly* and *wicked*.

Now, who knows what is called *ultimate beauty* and *ultimate virtue*?

For beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice,
they merely alternate in their rise and fall—
how could they be constant?

Thus, the Sage, knowing this to be so,
acts through the *Dao* in all things,
yet his actions arise from *wuwei* [non-action].
He teaches through conventional names,
yet his teaching arises from *non-speech*.

When actions arise from *wuwei*,
he works all day yet never acts;
when teaching arises from *non-speech*,
he speaks all day yet never speaks.

Then beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice—
why should I fix my heart upon them?

If this is so,
then wherever he goes, it is *wondrous*.

If wherever he goes is *wondrous*,
then the arising of all things—
I do not see their arising or who makes them arise,
I do not see their birth or who gives them birth,
I do not see their making or who makes them.

Thus, though they arise or do not arise,
though they are born or not born,
though they are made or not made—
what need have I for words, for possession, for reliance?

This is how *achievement is completed yet not dwelled upon*.

If one dwells upon it, then one must abandon it;
if one does not dwell upon it within oneself,
then where could one abandon it?

**Chapter Three: Not Esteeming the Virtuous**
Do not esteem the virtuous, and the people will not contend;
do not prize hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal;
do not display what is desirable, and the hearts of the people will not be disordered.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
empties their minds, fills their bellies,
weakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.
Ever makes the people return to simplicity, to natural desires—
so that the wise dare not act.

If one acts through *wuwei*,
then nothing will remain ungoverned.

The *Classics* say:
The Sage knows that beauty is ugliness, virtue is vice,
and I do not fix my heart upon them.
Thus, though I discard the world’s highest honors,
I simply fulfill my duty—
and the virtuous are not what I esteem.
Though I gather the world’s wealth,
I nourish virtue—
and hard-to-obtain goods are not what I prize.

The people’s contentions
always arise from competing for virtue;
knowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems,
they will not contend.
Hence it is said: *"To promote the virtuous is to make the people jostle."*

The people’s theft
always arises from desire for profit;
knowing that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,
they will not steal.
Hence it is said: *"If the child does not desire it,
though you reward him, he will not steal."*

What the noble seeks is virtue;
what the petty seeks is wealth.
If I do not show what is desirable,
then their hearts will not be disordered.

Yet this is not to abandon the virtuous in the wilds and not use them,
nor to discard hard-to-obtain goods and leave them on the ground.
It is simply that internally, I do not harbor them in my heart,
and externally, I do not leave their traces behind.

Thus, the Sage’s governance:
empties their minds, fills their bellies,
weakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.
The mind houses the *shen* [spirit], and the belly is the mind’s dwelling—
if the mind is emptied, the *shen* is undiminished and the belly is filled.
The kidneys house the will, and the bones are the kidneys’ remnant—
if the will is weakened, the *jing* [essence] is unshaken and the bones are strong.

If the mind is emptied while the belly is filled,
then the people are ever kept in simplicity.
If the will is weakened while the bones are strengthened,
then the people are ever kept without desire.

The wise, knowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems
and that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,
will not act for what is not profitable—
thus they dare not act.

Only in this way
does *wuwei* prevail,
and governance is naturally achieved.

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Effortlessness**
The Dao is effortless yet effective;
blunting its sharpness, it is never full.

Deep, it seems the origin of all things.
Blunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,
softening its brilliance, blending with dust—
serene, it seems as if it might exist.

I do not know whose child it is—
it precedes the *Imperial Sovereign*.

The *Classics* say:
All things carry *yin* while embracing *yang*,
and the interplay of *qi* brings harmony.
Thus, the *effortless*—
this is the harmony of *yin* and *yang*.

*Yin* is emptiness, *yang* is fullness;
the essence of the Dao is effortless,
yet its application may not be full.

Its essence is effortless,
so having or lacking desire is called *mystery*.

Its application is not full,
so the mind is emptied and the will weakened,
ever keeping the people without knowledge or desire.

Only in this way
does it seem the origin of all things,
yet seeking what makes it the origin—
it is fundamentally unattainable;
only its semblance remains.

Then how does one attain this Dao?
By blunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,
softening its brilliance, blending with dust.

When the mind exits and enters things, that is sharpness—
blunt its sharpness and do not act.
When things arrive and engage the mind, that is entanglement—
resolve its entanglements and do not disturb.

When sharpness is blunted and entanglements resolved,
the clarity of the constant shines forth from Heaven’s light.

Light is beyond dust;
dwelling in light without obscurity,
it is harmonized yet not distinguished.
Dust is within light;
dwelling in dust without dimness,
it is blended yet not differentiated.

Only in this way
does that which is called the origin
seem as if it might exist.

*Deep*—this speaks of its profundity.
*Serene*—this speaks of its clarity.
*Not full*—this is not a fixed emptiness.
*Seems to exist*—this is not a fixed existence.

Emptiness, fullness, existence, nonexistence—
I do not fix my heart upon them,
so how could I know their source of origin?

I only see their birth from the Heavenly *shen* and the *Imperial Sovereign*—
thus it is said: *I do not know whose child it is; it precedes the Imperial Sovereign.*

If there is *I*, *knowing*, *who*—
then the Dao is hidden.
If I do not know *who*,
then I also do not know *myself*—
this is the origin from which the true Dao emerges.

It precedes the Heavenly with its form,
it precedes the *Imperial Sovereign* with its beginning—
thus its status as prior to all form and instrument is clear.

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**
Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
they treat all things as *chúgǒu* [sacrificial dogs].
The Sage is not benevolent;
he treats the people as *chúgǒu*.

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like discarding a broken key?

Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever producing.

Much speech leads to exhaustion;
better to hold to the central way.

The *Classics* say:
The Dao is obscure before the *Imperial Sovereign’s* form,
and one does not know from whom it originates.
Thus, those who embody this Dao—
how could *benevolence* suffice to name them?

**Chapter Five (continued): The Nature of Benevolence**

Benevolence is but the human heart.

Heaven and Earth embody this Dao—
they do not act from benevolence,
treating all things as *chúgǒu*.
The Sage embodies this Dao—
they do not act from benevolence,
treating the people as *chúgǒu*.

The *chúgǒu* is but an object
that is kept without benevolence.

All things are of the same body as Heaven and Earth.
The people are of the same body as the Sage.

When Heaven and Earth regard themselves as *chúgǒu*,
then their regard for all things and the people is no different.
Thus, to nurture and raise them—
what need is there for benevolence?

Only the non-benevolent
can be called the Great Benevolence.

Thus, it is clear that between Heaven and Earth,
it is indeed like discarding a broken key.

For the discarded key—
its emptiness yet unyielding,
its motion yet ever producing—
is how it moves and yet endures.

Thus, the person who embodies this Dao
speaks from the unsaid alone.

To speak without speaking
is to know *wuwei* [non-action].

When sound manifests, it becomes speech;
when action manifests, it becomes deed.
To speak or act—
in essence, they are one.

Why?
Speech and deed share the same body—
such is their nature.

If one does not know this,
then speech does not arise from the unsaid.
Speech not arising from the unsaid
deviates from the empty motion of the discarded key—
thus, its excess and exhaustion are inevitable.

Confucius said:
Who among today’s singers understands this?
To know this is to know that speech arises from the unsaid.

Speech arises from the unsaid—
no one escapes this truth.
Yet those who cannot grasp it
fail to align their hearts
with the *You* [having] rather than the *Wu* [non-being],
with the *Qu* [taking] rather than the *Shi* [gathering].
They cannot harmonize with the Dao.

To neither have nor not have,
to neither take nor gather,
yet to harmonize with the Dao—
this is called *holding to the central way*.

To hold to the central way without ceasing
is to know the purpose of speech.
Thus, much speech leads to exhaustion—
better to make *holding to the central way* one’s duty.

Hence it is said:
The human heart is ever perilous,
the Dao-heart ever subtle.
Only the precise and singular
can steadfastly grasp the central way.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the *Xuàn Dàn* [Mysterious Feminine].
The *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Endless, as if it exists,
yet its use is effortless.

The *Classics* say:
The *Gǔ* [Valley] is the formed—
by obtaining *One*, it is empty yet full.
The *Shén* [Spirit] is the formless—
by obtaining *One*, it is still yet responsive.

The person who can hold to the central way and obtain *One*
can make the formed body as empty as the *Gǔ*,
the formless heart as still as the *Shén*—
then the formed and formless unite, and death does not come.

The ancients aligned body with heart,
heart with *qi*,
*qi* with Spirit,
Spirit with the *Wu* [Non-being].
Their teaching is this:

To unite is to not die;
to not die is to not be born;
the unborn can give birth to all things—
this is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.

The *Xuàn* is the union of *You* and *Wu*.
The *Dàn* is the giver of life.
Thus it is said:
The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.

The Dao generates Heaven and Earth from this—
thus it is called the *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate,
the root of Heaven and Earth.

If one says it does not exist,
it is endless yet never ceases.
If one says it exists,
how could one see its presence?

If it exists yet is not seen,
if it does not exist yet is not absent—
then my use and preservation of it
need no deliberation—
it is simply gathered, with no effort.

---

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**

Heaven is long, Earth enduring.

Heaven and Earth endure long because
they do not generate themselves—
thus they can generate eternally.

Therefore, the Sage places his body last,
yet his body is first;
sets his body aside,
yet his body is preserved.

Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.

The *Classics* say:
Length and shortness are form;
duration and nearness are time.
Heaven moves with time,
yet fears its form is insufficient—
thus it is called "long."
Earth moves with form,
yet fears its time is insufficient—
thus it is called "enduring."

The root of Heaven and Earth emerges from the *Xuàn Dàn*,
the substance of the *Xuàn Dàn* stands upon the undying *Gǔ* Spirit.
To not die is to not be born;
the unborn can give birth to all things—
thus the Earth can endure long.

The Sage does not consider his body a burden.
When forced by necessity, yet none can stop him—
thus it is said: "Place his body last, yet his body is first."
Established in the *Wu Hé Yǒu* [Non-Existent],
yet none can harm him—
thus it is said: "Set his body aside, yet his body is preserved."

The body is his private concern.
To place it last, to set it aside—
is to be public and without selfishness.
Without selfishness,
one can fulfill their selfishness.

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**

The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend;
it dwells where others disdain—
thus it approaches the Dao.

To dwell is to choose good ground;
to be still is to have a deep heart;
to act is to be benevolent;
to speak is to be trustworthy;
to govern is to be orderly;
to act is to be capable;
to move is to be timely.

Only because it does not contend
does it incur no blame.

The *Classics* say:
One *yin* and one *yang*—this is the Dao.
To follow it is good.
To call it "following" is already to depart from the Dao,
no longer its true body.

The supreme good is the Dao’s true good—
not what the world knows as good.
Thus, it is like water.

For water benefits all things yet does not contend,
dwells where others disdain—
and so the supreme good is likewise.
Though not perfect,
it nearly approaches the Dao.

The rivers and seas reign over all valleys
because they are low—
thus, to dwell is to choose good ground.
The stillness of a pool is deep,
the stillness of flowing water is deep—
thus, to be still is to have a deep heart.

The *Commentary* says:
To receive and not be full,
to draw and not be exhausted—
thus, in giving, it is supremely good.

To act boldly yet remain trustworthy—
thus, in speech, it is supremely trustworthy.

Its branches become rivers and valleys,
its gathering becomes the seas—
thus, in governance, it is supremely effective.

Nothing is softer or weaker than water,
yet in overcoming strength, none can surpass it—
thus, in action, it is supremely capable.

Its source flows ceaselessly,
day and night without pause,
filling the basin before advancing—
thus, in movement, it is supremely timely.

In essence, it arises from non-contention,
and takes dwelling in good ground as its root—
thus it is said:
Only by not contending
does one ensure none can contend with it,
and so there is no blame.

---
**Chapter Nine: "Holding Fullness"**
To hold fullness to the brim,
is not as good as ceasing before it.
To sharpen to a point,
cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them;
wealth and honor bring arrogance,
and one invites calamity.

When achievement is complete,
reputation fulfilled,
withdraw—
this is the Way of Heaven.

The *Commentary* says:
To hold is to prevent overflow,
but to fill to the brim is to risk it.
If one wishes to avoid overflow,
one must avoid filling to the brim—
thus, *"to hold fullness to the brim,
is not as good as ceasing before it."*

To measure is to fear loss,
but to sharpen to a point is to risk it.
If one wishes to avoid loss,
one must avoid sharpening to a point—
thus, *"to sharpen to a point,
cannot be long preserved."*

To be full yet not overflow
is how one long preserves wealth;
but to hold fullness to the brim
means gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them.

To be high yet not precarious
is how one long preserves nobility;
but to sharpen to a point
brings arrogance in wealth and honor,
and one invites retribution.

Then how does one escape this ruin?
Only by following the Way of Heaven.

Indeed, when achievement is complete,
reputation fulfilled,
withdraw—
this is the Way of Heaven,
the means by which the private is accomplished without selfishness.

Did the Keeper of Seals tell Yao to retreat,
thus embodying the Way of Heaven?

---
**Chapter Ten: "Nurturing the Vital Essence"**
To bear the vital essence and embrace unity,
can one remain undivided?

To focus the *qi* and attain softness,
can one be like an infant?

To purify and observe the subtle,
can one be without flaw?

To love the people and govern the state,
can one act without doing?

To open and close the heavenly gate,
can one be receptive like the female?

To be clear and all-pervading,
can one be without knowing?

To nurture and cherish life,
to give birth yet not possess,
to act yet not rely,
to grow yet not dominate—
this is called *Xuan* Virtue.

The *Commentary* says:
For one to have their body for long,
yet retreat to embody the Way of Heaven
without being burdened by achievement and reputation—
is this not difficult?

Yet there is a method.

When life first transforms, it is called *po* (vital breath).
When *po* and *jing* (essence) unite,
it is still and complete.

Once *po* is born, the male aspect is *hun* (ethereal soul).
When *hun* and spirit interact,
and *po* scatters with essence entering and exiting,
then *po* is scattered and does not embrace unity,
divided and not held.

To *load* is to complete and begin anew;
to *nurture* is to encircle without gap.

Though one has already become human,
if one bears the vital essence, embraces unity,
and remains tranquil and non-acting,
like the beginning of life’s transformation,
then one can remain undivided.

To remain undivided
is to focus the *qi* without division,
to attain softness without resistance,
and thus be like an infant.

To be like an infant
is to purge regret and stinginess,
to observe subtlety and marvel at the profound,
to perceive the slightest movement—
I must know it and be without flaw.

Thus, in nurturing the inner self,
one can love the people and govern the state
without being burdened by affairs,
and act without doing.

Within, to purify and observe the subtle without flaw,
without, to love the people and govern the state without doing—
then the heavenly gate opens and closes,
constantly within me,
and I can be receptive like the female.

Not advancing, not resisting,
responding yet not hoarding—
then one is clear and all-pervading,
and can be without knowing.

When the Way reaches non-knowing,
that is true knowing—
this is how one appears human yet is Heavenly.
What need for the burden of achievement and reputation?

To nurture and cherish life,
to give birth yet not possess,
to act yet not rely,
to grow yet not dominate—
this is how one aligns with Heaven.

*Xuan* Virtue has no other source—
it is the Virtue of Heaven.

**Chapter Eleven: "Thirty Spokes Converging at the Hub"**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
thus, the carriage serves.

Clay is shaped into vessels;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
thus, the vessel serves.

Doors and windows are carved for rooms;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
thus, the room serves.

Therefore, having is for advantage,
emptiness is for use.

The *Commentary* says:
Thirty spokes converge at one hub;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
the carriage is what I ride.

Clay is shaped into vessels;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
the vessel is what I use.

Doors and windows are carved for rooms;
its utility lies in its emptiness—
the room is where I dwell.

When riding, I observe the carriage;
when using, I observe the vessel;
when dwelling, I observe the room—
their use is never absent,
yet their emptiness is never distant.

As for the body,
why do I not know what I use it for?

Thus, having is for advantage,
emptiness is for use.

If having is for advantage,
and emptiness is not for use,
then what is called advantage
is also discarded and unused.

If emptiness is for use,
and having is not for advantage,
then what is called use
is also harmful and not advantageous.

Therefore, the Sage enters without possessing anything—
this is how emptiness serves as use.

Exits without lacking anything—
this is how having serves as advantage.

Thus it is said:
To refine essence and enter the divine
is to achieve use;
to benefit use and secure the body
is to elevate virtue.

**Chapter Twelve: "The Five Colors"**
The five colors blind the eyes,
the five tones deafen the ears,
the five flavors dull the palate,
hunting and chasing drive the mind to madness,
rare treasures lead to erratic conduct.

Therefore, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
thus, he discards the latter and takes the former.

**Chapter Thirteen: "The Chapter on Honor and Humiliation"**
It is said: The reason the eye is an eye is that it perceives colors yet is not itself a color. When it is bound to the five colors, it loses its true nature as an eye and becomes no different from blindness. The reason the ear is an ear is that it perceives sounds yet is not itself a sound. When it is bound to the five tones, it loses its true nature as an ear and becomes no different from deafness. The reason the mouth is a mouth is that it perceives flavors yet is not itself a flavor. When it is bound to the five flavors, it loses its true nature as a mouth and becomes no different from dullness.

When nothing in the ten thousand things can perturb it, the mind remains still and attains sageliness. To chase after externals is to lose all thought and fall into madness—this applies to all things, but hunting and chasing are especially so. Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no peril. To act in accordance with this is to preserve oneself. To seek beyond is to invite disgrace and peril, to obstruct one’s path—this applies to all things, but rare treasures are especially so.

The belly knows nothing, the eyes see much—thus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. Therefore, he discards the pursuit of what is seen and desired, and takes instead the emptiness and stillness of what knows nothing and desires nothing.

Honor and humiliation are like sudden shocks;
great calamity is like a threat to one’s body.

What is meant by "honor and humiliation as sudden shocks"?
Honor is a lower path—when one obtains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called "honor and humiliation as sudden shocks."

What is meant by "valuing great calamity as one’s body"?
The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.
When I have no body, what calamity can I have?
Thus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it;
to love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.

It is said: Honor is what is kept by others—it is the lower path. If one clings to one’s honor, then humiliation follows. The reason I have humiliation is that I have shock—before obtaining it, I am shocked by obtaining it; after obtaining it, I am shocked by losing it. If I had no shock, what humiliation could I have? Thus, the humiliation that comes with honor is no more than this.

Nobility is what keeps others—it is the higher path. If one clings to one’s nobility, then great calamity follows. The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body, so both joy and misfortune rest upon me. If I had no body, what joy could I have? Thus, the great calamity that comes with nobility is no more than this.

To speak of the body is to know shock as the mind;
to speak of shock is to know the body as a burden.
Without mind, there is no shock;
without shock, there is no humiliation;
without body, there is no burden;
without burden, there is no calamity.

In ancient times, Shun, as a commoner, befriended the Son of Heaven—this was indeed honor. Yet if he had clung to it, what humiliation could there be? The vastness of ruling the world was indeed nobility, yet if he had not taken ownership of it, what great joy could there be?

Thus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it.
If one invites humiliation through honor, then one degrades one’s body—this is not one who can entrust the world to it.
To love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.
If one incurs calamity through nobility, then one endangers one’s body—this is not one who can commit the world to it.

Only he who does not cling to his honor or his nobility—like Shun—is truly one who can entrust and commit the world to him.

**Chapter Fourteen: "The Chapter on the Unseen"**
That which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (uniform);
that which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare);
that which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).

These three cannot be forced or questioned,
so they merge into one.

Its upper aspect is not bright,
its lower aspect is not dark.

It is boundless yet cannot be named—
it returns to nothingness.

This is called the form of formlessness,
the image of no-thing—
this is called *hūhuǎng* (dim and vague).

Approach it and you see no head;
follow it and you see no tail.

Hold fast to the ancient Dao
to govern the present.

To know the ancient beginning is to hold the thread of the Way.

It is said: Vision is non-being, so it is unseen.
Though unseen, it can manifest as dark or yellow—
it cannot be named as having no color,
so it is called *yí* alone.

Hearing is non-being, so it is unheard.
Though unheard, it can manifest as *gōng* or *shāng*—
it cannot be named as having no sound,
so it is called *xī* alone.

Grasp is non-being, so it cannot be grasped.
Though not grasped, it can manifest as yin or yang,
as soft or hard,
as short or long,
as round or square,
as life or death,
as heat or cold,
as floating or sinking,
as emerging or vanishing,
as sweet or bitter,
as rank or fragrant—
it cannot be named as having no form,
so it is called *wēi* alone.

Some things may be sought and obtained through force,
but these three cannot be forced.
If they cannot be forced,
then one’s ears and eyes are confused,
one’s form and wisdom depart,
and yet I attain them—
then vision, hearing, and grasp merge into one.

Vision is through the eyes,
hearing is through the ears,
grasp is through the mind.
When they merge into one,
the ears become like eyes,
the eyes become like ears,
the mind becomes like eyes and ears.

Those who lose the Way see light above and mud below—
I have attained it, yet its upper aspect is not light,
so it is not bright;
its lower aspect is not mud,
so it is not dark.

Boundless yet true and trustworthy,
though it can be trusted,
it cannot be named—
thus it returns to nothingness alone.

Though it is nothingness,
it is called the form of formlessness,
the image of no-thing—
yet it is never truly nothingness.

This is called *hūhuǎng*—
not bright, so it seems to doubt nothingness,
yet it is not nothingness;
dim, so it seems to doubt somethingness,
yet it is not somethingness.

Its beginning has no front, so when you meet it, you cannot see its head;
its end has no tail, so when you follow it, you cannot see its rear.
With neither front nor rear, it is neither ancient nor modern.
Though neither ancient nor modern, it is never truly without ancient and modern—
thus it endures beyond the ancient past without growing old.
I have attained it and call it *use*—
so it is said: grasp the Dao of the ancient to govern the present’s existence.

What is called the ancient is not different from the present—
it is to know the ancient’s origin.
What is called the present is not different from the ancient—
it is to know the present’s source.

If one truly knows the ancient’s origin,
then one knows the present’s source.

The origin has no source,
the coming has no origin—
this is called the beginningless beginning.
The beginningless beginning is the Dao’s measure.
The Dao cannot be grasped,
yet attaining this, one can grasp it as virtue—
grasp virtue, this is called measure.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Master of the Way**

The ancient master of the Way was subtle, mysterious, and profound—
so deep it could not be known.
Because it could not be known,
he forced himself to assume outward forms:
Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,
fearful as if wary of neighbors,
solemn as a guest,
melting like ice about to thaw,
solid as uncarved wood,
vast as a valley,
muddy as turbid water.

Who can make turbid water still and gradually clear?
Who can make the settled move and gradually give birth?
Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Because they do not desire fullness,
they can endure wear without renewal.

It is said: The ancient master of the Way
would perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit.
Though not yet reaching Sagehood or spirit,
his method to perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit
was already fully heard.

Subtle, then mysterious;
mysterious, then profound;
profound, then penetrating—
thus it is too deep to be known.
Because it cannot be known,
how could its outward form be compared or discussed?
He only forced himself to assume these forms.

Cautious as one crossing a river in winter—
urged, then he moves;
forced, then he rises.

Fearful as if wary of neighbors—
keeping evil at bay while preserving sincerity,
not held by things, so his mind does not stray.

Solemn as a guest—
not the host.

Melting like ice about to thaw—
about to complete with mind concentrated and form released,
bones and flesh both dissolving.

Solid as uncarved wood—
returning to its origin.

Vast as a valley—
responding without hoarding.

Muddy as turbid water—
no entanglement in *this* and *that*, *me* and *you*.

All men are bright and clear—
who can make turbid water still and gradually clear?
Gradually clear, then nothing escapes its illumination.

All men seek precedence—
who can make the settled move and gradually give birth?
Gradually give birth, then nothing escapes its emergence.

To desire stillness, one must level the breath;
to desire spirit, one must follow the heart.
If one acts yet seeks correctness,
it is forced beyond necessity.
Leveling the breath, following the heart—
this is how one gradually clears.
Forced beyond necessity—
this is how one gradually gives birth.
This is how the master of the Way
can perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit.

The Dao’s essence is *chong*—
*chong* is the harmony of yin and yang,
the preservation of fullness and emptiness.
Yet those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—
thus it is emptiness alone.
Yet it is not called emptiness,
but always *not full*—
lest people be burdened by emptiness.
Burdened by emptiness, it is no longer emptiness—
so it is said: *sometimes not full*, but simply not desiring fullness.

All things under heaven have newness, then wear,
wear, then ruin—
few can avoid wear.
Only by not desiring fullness
does newness, wear, ruin, and formation
find no place in the heart—
thus though worn, it is not worn,
and though not worn, it is neither new nor formed.

**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**

Attain the extremes of emptiness,
guard stillness with sincerity.
When all things arise together,
I observe their return.

Things teem and flourish,
each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
stillness is called restoring the Mandate.
Restoring the Mandate is called constancy;
knowing constancy is called clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.
Knowing constancy is tolerance;
tolerance is impartiality;
impartiality is kingship;
kingship is Heaven;
Heaven is the Dao;
the Dao is enduring—
dying without peril.

It is said: Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,
yet their governance is empty yet not extreme,
their stillness is guarded yet not rigid—
this is not the utmost of *not full*.

Common men, when exhausted, see things return;
when decayed, see things return to their roots.
But I, with utmost emptiness and stillness,
see how all things arise and why they teem—
in me, not in them.
Their arising is their returning.
When they teem, it is their returning to roots.

Thus, observing their arising together,
I see their returning—
when they teem, each returning to its root.

Then what is called emptiness?
Not emptied by emptiness,
but simply not filled—
thus it is emptiness.

What is called stillness?
Not stilled by stillness—
things teem, each returning to its root, yet unaware,
and nothing can disturb the mind—
thus it is stillness.
Thus returning to the root is called stillness.

The Mandate is what I receive to live.
Only in stillness does one restore what gives life,
and can command things—
thus stillness is called restoring the Mandate.

When the Dao reaches commanding things,
it is constant and does not depart—
thus restoring the Mandate is called constancy.

Observing from constancy,
fortune and misfortune, regret and blame
are seen in the subtlest movements—
what more clarity is needed?
Thus knowing constancy is called clarity.

Those who do not know constancy act in opposition—
their actions cannot escape recklessness.

If one knows constancy and embodies it,
all things and I become one—
thus knowing constancy is tolerance.

When all things and I are one,
then there is no self-seeking within the body—
thus tolerance becomes public virtue.

When all things and I are one,
and there is no selfishness—
this is greatness, and greatness is sagehood.
Inner sagehood, outer kingship—
thus public virtue becomes kingship.

Sagehood then reaches the divine—
thus kingship becomes Heaven.
Heaven is divine—
the Dao is what perfects sagehood and fulfills the divine—
thus Heaven is the Dao.

To practice the Dao until reaching constancy
is to exhaust it—
thus the Dao is enduring, and one’s life is secure.
When enduring reaches the point where one’s life is secure,
this is called constancy.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**
The Supreme Sage knows existence is real;
the next knows it through affection and praise;
the next knows it through fear and contempt.

When trust is insufficient, there is distrust—
thus words are precious.
When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the people say, *"It was natural."*
The Classic says:
*"Hold fast to the Great Image—
the world follows.
Because the world is about to release me and forget me,
how can my traces be seen?"*
Thus, the next knows existence is real.

Those who know existence is real
cannot be surpassed—
thus they are called Supreme Sage.
Those who are praised and honored are next,
and those feared and scorned are next—
this is clear.

How can this be explained?
Now, the love and reverence between father and son
requires no words to understand.
But in guest-host relations or friendships,
to convey the intent of reverence,
one must adorn it with words before it is understood.
Why?
Because trust is sufficient or insufficient.

Thus, praise and affection arise from insufficient trust and distrust—
how much more so for fear and contempt?

If one wishes to make trust insufficient and distrustful,
how should they proceed?
Make words precious,
and return to the Dao.

To make words precious
is to practice the teaching of non-action.
To practice the teaching of non-action
is to engage in affairs of non-doing.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the people say, *"It was natural,"*
and none know who did it—
who then can praise or honor them?

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Decayed**
When the Great Dao decays, there is benevolence and righteousness;
when wisdom arises, there is great deceit;
when familial bonds fracture, there is filial piety and kindness;
when states are chaotic, there are loyal ministers.

The Classic says:
*"The Dao cannot be named—
to name it the Dao
is already not the Dao.*
Thus, it is divided into benevolence and righteousness—
how can this be the whole of the Dao?

The greatest thief is when virtue has a mind and the mind has eyes,
and when eyes turn inward—
inward vision leads to ruin.
Thus, when wisdom arises, there is great deceit.
Deceit is the reversal of virtue.

When benevolence and righteousness exist,
their flaws lead to fractured familial bonds and filial piety.
When great deceit exists,
its flaws lead to chaotic states and loyal ministers.

Thus, there are the stubbornness of the blind and the arrogance of the crippled,
and only then does there arise Shun.
There are the tyrannies of Jie and Zhou,
and only then do there arise Longfeng and Bi Gan.
This is no other reason—
the farther one strays from the root.

**End of Volume One of the *True Transmission of the Dao and Its Virtue***
**Volume Two of the *True Transmission of the Dao and Its Virtue***

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**

To discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,
the people’s benefit is a hundredfold.
To discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
To discard cleverness and abandon profit,
thieves and robbers vanish.

These three things—
though insufficient as adornment—
are thus made to have their proper place.

To manifest simplicity and embrace purity,
to reduce selfishness and diminish desires.

The transmission says:
The Sage knows that the world’s chaos
begins with confusion of the root and loss of nature.
Only the nameless purity can settle it.
To discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,
to discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,
to discard cleverness and abandon profit—
this is how we restore our nameless purity and settle it.

To discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,
to discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,
then the mind is not burdened by beauty and goodness.
To discard cleverness and abandon profit,
then the mind is not burdened by evil and wrongdoing.
Within, the mind is not burdened,
without, no trace is left behind—
thus the people’s benefit is a hundredfold,
the people return to filial piety and kindness,
and thieves and robbers vanish—
this is their natural course.

Indeed, to discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,
to discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,
is not merely to cease honoring the worthy—
to discard and abandon them means more than mere cessation.
To discard cleverness and abandon profit,
is not merely to cease valuing rare goods—
to discard and abandon them means more than mere disdain.

Human life—
all things are already complete within us—
thus there is the utmost abundance of wealth.
To discard the Sage and abandon wisdom and return to the origin,
then its benefit is a hundredfold.
The people return to filial piety and kindness,
and the six relations are harmonious,
yet they do not know what filial piety is.
Thieves and robbers vanish,
and the state governs well,
yet they do not know what loyal ministers are.
To cease honoring the worthy,
so the people do not contend—
the people’s benefit is a hundredfold,
the people return to filial piety and kindness—
this is more than mere non-contention.
To cease valuing rare goods,
so the people do not steal—
thieves and robbers vanish—
this is more than mere non-theft.

The Sage’s wisdom, benevolence and righteousness,
cleverness and profit—
these three things are adornment, not substance,
insufficient and incomplete.
Thus they are discarded and abandoned,
so that their proper place may be restored.

To manifest simplicity and embrace purity,
to reduce selfishness and diminish desires—
this is their proper place.
To manifest simplicity means to know it is unmixed and not adorned,
to embrace purity means to know it is undispersed and not insufficient.
Simple yet unmixed, pure yet undispersed—
then nature is restored,
and external things cannot confuse,
while selfishness is reduced and desires diminished.
Only then can one speak of the ultimate Dao of discarding learning.

**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning Brings No Worry**

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Form**

*"Yes" and "No"—how far apart are they?
Good and evil—how distant are they?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
Ah, boundless—its endlessness!

The crowd rejoices, feasting on grand sacrifices,
ascending spring platforms.
I alone am timid, yet unformed—
like an infant before speech,
wandering, as if nowhere to return.

The crowd all have abundance,
while I alone seem forsaken.
Oh, my foolish heart—so pure!
The common man is bright and clear,
while I alone seem dim;
the common man is sharp and discerning,
while I alone am muddled.
Obscured as if in darkness,
silent, as if without end.
The crowd all have their ways,
while I alone seem dull and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
valuing the Mother-Nourisher.

The Classic says:
Above, abandon the Sage’s wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—
below, abandon cleverness and profit—
so as not to burden the mind,
and thus attain *Discarding Learning*.
Discarding Learning means *Non-Action*;
*Non-Action* means *Spirit*;
*Spirit* is the movement of all things
without sharing the Sage’s worries.
Thus it is said: *Discarding Learning brings no worry.*

*"Yes" and "No"* arise from a single sound—
how far apart are they?
Good and evil separate from the One Dao—
how distant are they?
This is why even the Sage abandons them,
so as not to burden the mind.

Regret and fear arise from rigidity;
calm without blame arises from repentance—
thus what people fear, one must not fail to fear.

Ah, boundless—its endlessness!
Endlessness speaks of its vastness without limit,
and not merely fearing what others fear.

The noble one, cautious and mindful,
fears what is right and follows the Great,
aligns with Heaven and the Dao.

What people fear, one must not fail to fear—
this is to align with humanity.
Ah, boundless—its endlessness!
This is to align with Heaven.

The crowd rejoices, yet they do not close their senses,
nor shut their gates.
Feasting on grand sacrifices,
they do not know the simplicity of true flavor.
Ascending spring platforms,
they do not know the insufficiency of what is seen.
I alone am timid, yet unformed—
like an infant before speech—
thus I close my senses,
shut my gates,
and find no taste to crave,
no sight to delight in.
Wandering, as if nowhere to return—
speaking of how all things ride upon it,
yet in me there is no dwelling.

The crowd feast on grand sacrifices,
ascend spring platforms—
thus they all have abundance.
I alone am timid, yet unformed—
like an infant before speech—
thus I alone seem forsaken.
All this speaks of abandoning things and departing from form.

Oh, my foolish heart—
speaking of its original knowing.
Pure—speaking of its unmixed nature.
The common man is bright and clear,
while I alone seem dim—
thus I differ from the common man’s brightness.
The common man is sharp and discerning,
while I alone am muddled—
thus I differ from the common man’s sharpness.
Obscured as if in darkness—
darkness means seeing nothing at all.
Seeing nothing at all—
not merely dim and muddled—
in motion, wandering as if nowhere to return;
in stillness, silent as if without end.
The common man is bright and clear,
the common man is sharp and discerning—
thus they all have their ways.
I alone seem dim, I alone seem muddled—
thus I seem dull and coarse.
All this speaks of departing from wisdom and forgetting the mind.

Sight, hearing, thought, and deliberation—
these arise from the Dao.
Thus the Dao is their Mother,
while they are its children.
Yet the crowd chase after things,
enslaving their wisdom,
to nourish their sight, hearing, thought, and deliberation—
thus they only nourish their children.
But I abandon and depart from them,
for I value nourishing the Mother.
Thus it is said: *I alone differ from others, valuing the Mother-Nourisher.*

The Old Master was divine—
what did He cultivate to nourish?
Only that He differed from the common and vulgar,
to teach those who seek the Dao
that this is how one may attain it.
Thus the great intent of *Discarding Learning* is known.

Yet the earlier scholars said:
*"If a man does not learn, though worry-free like a beast,
how little they know of the meaning of Discarding Learning to bring no worry!"*

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Form**
The Sage’s virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
only vague, only hazy.
Hazy and vague—
within it, there are forms;
Vague and hazy—
within it, there are things.
Deep and dark—
within it, there is essence,
its essence most true,
within it, there is faithfulness.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
to observe all things.

How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

The Classic says:
When abandoning things and departing from form
until one seems forsaken,
when departing from wisdom and forgetting the mind
until one seems coarse—
then one’s virtue is at its peak.

From what shall one follow?
Only the Dao.

As a thing—
only vague, only hazy.
When hazy and vague,
vague then is not confused—
not confused, then clear—
clear, then doubts there are things—
yet within it, there are forms.
Forms—
doubting there are things yet not things—
thus it is said: *"The form of the formless,"*
and again: *"The Great Form has no shape."*

When vague and hazy,
hazy then is not bright—
not bright, then dark—
dark, then doubts there are no things—
yet within it, there are things.
Things—
doubting there are no things yet there are—
thus it is said: *"The state of the stateless,"*
and again: *"Things in confusion take form."*

Vague and hazy—then unfathomable;
unfathomable—then divine.
Deep and dark—
the divine beyond the divine.
The divine beyond the divine yet able to refine—
thus it is said: *Deep and dark—within it, there is essence.*
Essence—
obtaining the Dao’s One without mixture.
Under Heaven, all things are true yet not false,
faithful yet not forceful,
constant yet unchanging—
nothing surpasses this.
And the beginning of all things,
I observe it here—
thus it is said: *Its essence is most true, within it, there is faithfulness.*
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
to observe all things.

Thus, those who cultivate the Dao do not seek clarity nor obscurity,
but preserve its hazy vagueness.
They neither see nor hear,
but govern its profound darkness.
When there is form, there are things;
when there are things, there is essence;
when there is essence, there is faithfulness.
When cultivating the Dao reaches faithfulness,
it aligns with my heart and all things are attained.

To know how Heaven, Earth, and all things become what they are—
none do not begin here.
Thus it is said: *How do I know all things are thus?*
By this.

**Chapter 22: "Curving Completes"**
Curving completes, bending makes straight,
hollow fills, worn renews,
fewness gains, excess confuses.
Thus the Sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.

Not self-illuminating, hence clarity;
not self-affirming, hence manifest;
not self-praising, hence merit;
not self-exalting, hence longevity.
Only by not contending does one surpass all contention.
Was the ancient saying *"Curving completes"* mere empty words?
Truly complete, and thus it returns.

The Classic says: *To know all things as they are, then one can embrace the One and align with gentleness.*
To embrace the One and govern gentleness,
then one can curve, can bend,
can hollow, can wear.
Curving is the natural way of curving;
bending is the forced way of curving.
Of all things under Heaven, only water approaches the Dao.
Flowing west, then east—nothing can harm it: *this is curving completing.*
Avoiding obstacles, yet always eastward: *this is bending straightening.*
Descending well, all valleys flow to it: *this is hollow filling.*
Receiving all filth, yet never unclean: *this is worn renewing.*
Only those who obtain the One suffice for this,
thus it is said: *fewness gains.*
Common people cannot do this because they lack unity,
thus it is said: *excess confuses.*

In managing wealth, there must be a model;
in passing on land and timber, there must be a model.
What is held is few, yet what is responded to is broad.
The Sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven—
thus can one curve, can one bend,
can one hollow, can one wear.
Nowhere is there anything but the One,
thus following what all under Heaven sees and seeing it,
yet not self-illuminating—
then all that is seen is examined without flaw,
thus it is said: *not self-illuminating, hence clarity.*
Following what all under Heaven affirms and affirming it,
yet not self-affirming—
then all that is affirmed cannot be concealed,
thus it is said: *not self-affirming, hence manifest.*
Returning all under Heaven’s merit to oneself,
yet not self-praising—
then merit is attained,
thus it is said: *not self-praising, hence merit.*
Entrusting all things with ability,
yet not self-exalting—
then longevity is attained,
thus it is said: *not self-exalting, hence longevity.*
Such is no other—
obtaining the One means no self,
no self means no contention.
Only by not contending does no one under Heaven contend with them.

The ancient saying *"Curving completes"*—
its essence is as such.
Knowing how to curve and complete,
then one knows how to bend and straighten,
hollow and fill,
wear and renew.
Not self-illuminating, hence clarity;
not self-affirming, hence manifest;
not self-praising, hence merit;
not self-exalting, hence longevity—
all arise from this.
Is this not what is meant by *complete and thus it returns*?

**Chapter 23: "Sparse Speech, Natural"**
A gusting wind does not last a morning,
a sudden rain does not last a day.
Who makes this? Only Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—
how much less can mortals?

Thus those who follow the Dao:
those aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao;
those aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue;
those aligned with loss are aligned with loss.
Aligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;
aligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;
aligned with loss, loss is obtained.
Faith is insufficient, hence there is doubt.

The Classic says: *Listening yet not hearing is called sparse speech,*
yet knowing why one speaks,
then speech arises from non-speech,
and listening yet not hearing is attained—
thus it is said: *sparse speech.*
Sparse speech is speaking in accordance with the Dao,
thus it is said: *natural.*

Gusting winds and sudden rains—
their completion is violent and abrupt,
not arising from the usual order,
thus even Heaven and Earth cannot endure a morning or a day.
Human speech not arising from naturalness—
then much and frequent exhaustion is inevitable.
Only those who follow the Dao can truly have no self.

No self, then the Dao, virtue, and loss—
I do not see how they differ,
thus those aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao,
those aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue,
those aligned with loss are aligned with loss,
and all convolutions merge into one.

Only by not seeing how they differ and aligning with them,
then even if they differ from me,
they never depart from me—
thus it is said: *aligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;
aligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;
aligned with loss, loss is obtained.*
Only when faith is insufficient
do Dao, virtue, and loss differ—
thus it is said: *faith is insufficient, hence there is doubt.*

**Chapter 24: "The Limping Do Not Stand"**
The limping do not stand,
the straddling do not walk.
Self-illuminating is not clarity,
self-affirming is not manifest,
self-praising is without merit,
self-exalting is not longevity.
In regard to the Dao, they are surplus food and encumbering steps—
things may detest them,
thus those with the Dao do not dwell among them.

The Classic says: *The limping as standing is not the usual way of standing,*
the straddling as walking is not the usual way of walking—
thus it cannot endure,
so though standing, they do not stand,
though walking, they do not walk.
The Dao is inherently without self,
without self means no contention,
then self-illuminating, self-affirming, self-exalting—
these are not their usual ways,
thus in regard to the Dao, they are surplus food and encumbering steps.

Common people all crave them,
yet I take them as well—
this is surplus food.
Nature is inherently without them, yet they are extravagantly indulged—
this is encumbering steps.

Excess nourishment and burdensome actions are detested by things,
thus those with the Dao rightly do not dwell among them.

The Dao abides where common people detest,
yet it is said that things may detest it—
thus why do those with the Dao not dwell there?
It is because the lowly, humble, yielding, and weak
are what common people detest and abandon—
thus those with the Dao dwell among them.
Those who boast and vaunt themselves
are what common people detest and contend against—
thus they are not dwelled among.

So whether dwelling or not dwelling,
their essence is the same: non-contention.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indistinctly Formed Thing**

There is a thing indistinctly formed,
born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and boundless,
it stands alone yet does not change,
circulates endlessly yet does not weary—
it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.

I do not know its name,
so I call it the Dao.
Forcing a name upon it, I call it Great.

Great means passing,
passing means distant,
distant means returning.
Thus the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sage-King is also Great.

Within the Four Seas, there are four Greats,
and the Sage-King occupies one of them.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
and the Dao follows the Natural Way.

The Classic says:
There is *qi*, there is form, there is substance—
thus the positions of Heaven, Earth, and humans
may be heard, seen, and grasped,
and the ears, eyes, and mind distinguish these things—
yet *qi*, form, and substance have not yet been seen.
*Qi*, form, and substance are indistinctly mingled and not yet separated,
so when viewed, they are invisible;
when listened to, they are inaudible;
when grasped, they cannot be held—
thus their form cannot be seen.
I do not know its name,
so I name it according to its meaning—
thus I call it the Dao.

Not knowing its name, I grasp it with the mind.
I name it the Dao, speaking of it by its meaning.

The Dao as a thing—
when used, it fills the six voids,
but when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown—
how could "Great" suffice to name it?
It is merely a forced name.

Great means it circulates universally without exclusion,
not confined to my body alone—
thus Great is called Passing.
Passing means it moves far without resistance—
thus Passing is called Distant.
Distant without resistance means
seeking its boundary yields nothing—
returning to its root, it never truly leaves my body—
thus Distant is called Returning.

The Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sage-King is also Great—
outside the Four Seas, "Great" is insufficient to describe it.
The so-called four Greats exist within the realm.

The Sage-King is the fulfillment of human Dao.
Knowing constancy, he embraces it,
and embracing it, he becomes public—
public, he becomes the Sage-King—
thus within the realm, there are four Greats,
and the Sage-King occupies one.

The Sage-King is the consummate expression of human Dao.

Humans, with their form, align with the formless—
Earth does the same—
thus where Earth reaches, humans also reach—
hence, "Humans follow Earth."
Where Heaven reaches, Earth also reaches—
hence, "Earth follows Heaven."
Where the Dao reaches, Heaven also reaches—
hence, "Heaven follows the Dao."
The Dao is self-rooted, self-originating,
existing before Heaven and Earth,
eternally present since antiquity,
and takes the Natural Way as its law.
The Natural Way is lawlessness—
thus, "The Dao follows the Natural Way."

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Light Root, the Still as Restless Sovereign**

The heavy is the root of the light,
the still is the sovereign of the restless.
Thus the virtuous person, though traveling all day,
never departs from his baggage.
Though adorned with splendor,
his repose is serene and detached.

How can one who rules a thousand chariots
lighten himself against the world?
Lightness leads to losing ministers,
restlessness leads to losing sovereignty.

The Classic says:
The light is first to be moved,
the heavy is last to respond—
response arises from being moved—
thus the heavy is the root of the light.
The still commands things,
the restless is commanded by things—
restlessness is always the servant of stillness—
thus stillness is the sovereign of the restless.

Therefore, even within a day’s journey,
the virtuous person’s actions are measured and restrained—
yet still, he does not depart from his baggage,
for lightness cannot exist without weight.
Though adorned with splendor may suffice for comfort,
there is also serene repose—
thus restlessness cannot exist without stillness.

If even daily travel and splendor require this,
how much more so for the ruler of a thousand chariots,
bearing heavy burdens and distant paths,
observing all under Heaven—
how could he not be still and heavy?

Forced into motion, responding only when moved,
acting only when unavoidable—
this is heaviness.
Doing nothing—
this is stillness.

If his actions are always within his own power,
yet he cannot refrain from doing—
then he lightens himself against the world without weight,
and without weight, he is restless and not still.

Thus it is said:
Above, there is non-action,
below, there is also non-action—
this makes below and above share the same virtue,
and below and above sharing virtue means no submission.
Below has action,
above also has action—
this makes above and below share the same Dao,
and above and below sharing the Dao means no sovereignty.

For the light takes on the labor of ministers and substitutes for them—
if ministers do nothing and share the Dao with above,
they are not ministers—
not ministers means losing ministers.

The restless forgets the ruler’s ease and serves the world—
if the ruler also acts, and above and below share the Dao,
he is not sovereign—
not sovereign means losing sovereignty.

Thus it is said:
Lightness leads to losing ministers,
restlessness leads to losing sovereignty.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**

The good way leaves no tracks,
good speech leaves no flaws,
good calculation does not use reckoning,
good closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened,
good binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.

Thus the Sage always rescues people,
so there are none abandoned;
always rescues things,
so there are none discarded—
this is called following clarity.

Thus the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
the unvirtuous are the resources of the good.
Not valuing one’s teacher,
not cherishing one’s resources—
though one may know, it is utter confusion—
this is called the essential mystery.

The Classic says:
A chariot’s passage leaves tracks,
A pedestrian’s steps leave footprints—
Thus movement cannot truly lack traces.

Knowing how movement moves,
Movement arises from non-movement,
Hence it is said: *Good movement leaves no tracks.*

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise—
Thus speech cannot truly lack flaws.

Knowing how speech speaks,
Speech arises from non-speech,
Hence it is said: *Good speech leaves no flaws.*

One and speech make two,
Two and one make three—
From this onward, even clever reckoning cannot tally,
Only he who attains unity and forgets speech
Can truly bring numbers to completion.

When numbers are complete,
Their calculation cannot be exhausted,
Hence it is said: *Good calculation does not use reckoning.*

The Celestial Gate has no barrier—
Its opening and closing lie within me.
If I do not open it,
Who can force it ajar?
Hence it is said: *Good closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened.*

The world has its natural order—
It is bound not by cords or ropes,
But by following its natural state,
Hence it is said: *Good binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.*

Thus, if movement does not follow this,
Movement cannot lack traces;
If speech does not follow this,
Speech cannot lack flaws;
If calculation, closure, or binding do not follow this,
Though reckoning is used, it brings chaos,
Though locks are set, they are opened,
Though cords are tied, they are undone—
What remains within oneself
Cannot avoid decay.
How then can there be time to rescue people or things?

Only the Sage understands the Dao
And masters these five arts,
Thus always rescues people and leaves none abandoned,
Always rescues things and leaves none discarded.

How so?
These five are the inherent principles of nature and life,
Shared by all.
Only the Sage, with his clarity of knowing the constant,
Rescues at the point where all share it—
Though movement, speech, calculation, closure, and binding occur,
None know how it is done,
For his clarity is subtle and unseen,
Hence it is called *following clarity.*

Only because he excels in rescue
Is the good person the teacher of the unvirtuous,
And the unvirtuous the resources of the good.
How could one abandon what is unvirtuous?
Yet still—
Those who seek the Dao forget the mind,
Though the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
I do not value my teacher,
Though the unvirtuous are the resources of the good,
I do not cherish my resources.
Not valuing one’s teacher,
Not cherishing one’s resources—
Though wise, one remains utterly lost—
This is called the *essential mystery.*

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**

Know the heroic,
Hold to the receptive—
Thus you become the world’s valley.

As the world’s valley,
Your virtue remains unchanging,
Returning to the infant.

Know the bright,
Hold to the dark—
Thus you become the world’s model.

As the world’s model,
Your virtue does not err,
Returning to the boundless.

Know the honored,
Hold to the humbled—
Thus you become the world’s source.

As the world’s source,
Your virtue is complete,
Returning to the uncarved.

The uncarved scatters to become vessels,
The Sage uses it to become officials—
Thus great governance does not cut.

The Classic says:
The heroic stirs while the receptive is still,
The heroic is firm while the receptive is yielding,
The heroic leads while the receptive responds.

Know the heroic,
Hold to the receptive—
Thus you attain deep stillness and yield,
Responding without leading,
Hence you become the world’s valley.

The valley, as a thing,
Receives from the mountains and flows to the seas—
Receiving without resistance,
Flowing without accumulation—
A thing that communicates without obstruction,
Thus virtue remains unchanging.

Man’s life,
Virtue is internally complete,
Unconnected to things—
Yet when swayed by things,
Daily it grows more distant.

Only by attaining deep stillness,
Yielding and responding without leading,
Does virtue remain unchanging,
Returning to the infant.

Brightness in color is receiving hues,
In things is clarity,
In action is metal,
In numbers is four.
Darkness in color is resisting stain,
In things is obscurity,
In action is water,
In numbers is one.

Know the bright,
Hold to the dark—
Not receiving the stains of ten thousand things,
Like obscurity, like water,
Ending in embracing unity.

Embrace unity,
You can bend, you can yield,
You can hollow, you can decay—
Thus you can become the world’s model.

As the world’s model,
Without bending yet not straying from one,
Your virtue does not err.

Not straying means
Not straying from its original place,
Yet not necessarily avoiding force—
Avoiding force means not differing.
The infant, as a thing,
Focuses qi and attains yielding,
Never losing its one,
Its body in harmony.
Returning to the boundless,
Even the infant is insufficient to describe it.

Grass and trees flourish as honored,
Wither as humbled—
Man’s honored and humbled,
Also such it is.

Know the honored,
Hold to the humbled,
Discarding ornament to return to root—
Though covered by what the world most despises,
It cannot burden you,
Hence you become the world’s source.

The source, as a thing,
Empty yet can be filled,
Responsive yet does not hoard—
The origin from which rivers and seas arise.
To become the world’s source,
Is to return to its origin,
Thus virtue is complete—
Not merely avoiding force.

Returning to the uncarved,
The uncarved is the whole of truth,
The mingled origin of things—
Only because it is mingled and not yet shaped
Can it be great and small,
Bend and straight,
Short and long,
Round and square—
Nothing it cannot become,
Thus the boundless is insufficient to describe it.

Yet if holding to the receptive,
Holding to the dark,
Holding to the humbled is enough—
Why bother knowing the heroic, the bright, or the honored?
For holding is the mother,
Knowing is the child—

The Dao/Way as the principle,
Knowledge as its application.

When the uncarved scatters, it becomes things—
Things, as objects,
Can be great yet cannot be small,
Can bend yet cannot straighten,
Can shorten yet cannot lengthen,
Can round yet cannot square—
Thus the Sage employs them only as officials and ministers,
Not as the means to attain public virtue or kingship.

If one embraces the uncarved to govern the world,
Their view of the world’s order
Is like the butcher Ding’s view of the ox—
They never see the whole ox,
Acting only where there is no work to be done,
Ample indeed in their ease, with room to spare for the blade—
What need is there for cutting?

Hence it is said: *"The greatest governance does not cut."*

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Those Who Would Take the World**
Those who would seize the world to rule it,
I see their failure is inevitable.

The world is a divine vessel,
Not to be forced.

To force it is to ruin it,
To grasp it is to lose it.

Thus things move or follow,
Are offered or rejected,
Are strong or weak,
Are raised or toppled.

Therefore the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids excessiveness.

The Classic says:
The Sage embraces the uncarved to govern the world,
Thus the greatest governance does not cut—
Their way of taking the world is simply to do nothing.

To take is to win the world’s heart,
To keep it from departing.

Thus those who would seize the world to rule it
Are not the way to take the world.

To take what should not be taken is why I see their failure.

That which is above form is called the Dao/Way,
That which is below form is called things.

The world as things is a divine vessel.
Only the divine Dao can govern divine things.

The Dao has no scheming,
No doing—
Yet if one acts for it,
That is not its way.
Thus it cannot be forced.

To force is to seek completion,
Yet completion only brings ruin.
To grasp is to seek possession,
Yet possession only brings loss.

Emperor Yao did not claim superiority,
Nor did he see others as inferior.
Majestic indeed were Shun and Yu’s rule over the world,
Yet they did not take credit—
This is the true way to take the world,
Not by forcing and grasping.

Thus all things have movement and follow,
Have compliance and resistance,
Have strength and weakness,
Have elevation and collapse—
The natural course of affairs cannot be otherwise.
How then can one force and grasp them?

Therefore the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids excessiveness,
Simply aiding the natural unfolding of all things—
How dare they interfere?

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way**
To assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way
Is not to use force to dominate the world—
Their affairs return like a boomerang.

Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.
After great campaigns, there are years of famine.
Thus the virtuous act decisively yet do not boast,
Do not vaunt their achievements,
Do not grow arrogant,
Act only when unavoidable,
And do not seek force.

Things grow strong then age—
This is called not the Dao.
Not the Dao, it perishes early.

The Classic says:
The sovereign is one of non-action.
The assistant is one of action.
To take the world cannot be without consequence,
Yet if one acts without restraint,
Their ruin comes from using force—
Though the assistant acts, if not in accord with the Dao,
How much more so the sovereign’s non-action?

This is why their affairs return like a boomerang.
If one subdues the world with the Dao,
The world dare not refuse.
But if one subdues the world with force,
They will resist and oppose you.

What you send out returns to you.
Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.
After great campaigns, there are years of famine.
The army’s harm to the world is thus—
Thus the skilled warrior acts decisively yet does no more.

Decisive means conquering the enemy.
To conquer the enemy—
When the enemy’s attack is like a wailing wind,
When their defense is like a towering rampart—
This is decisive.

Acting only when unavoidable,
Not relying on force to dominate.
Decisive yet not proud of ability,
Decisive yet not boasting of victory,
Decisive yet not arrogant in power—
Their decisiveness always arises from necessity—
This is the way of decisiveness without force.

If one is decisive yet proud of ability,
Decisive yet boasts of victory,
Decisive yet arrogant in power—
Then this is decisiveness in force,
Not decisiveness from necessity.

All things grow young then strong,
Strong then age—
This is their nature.
The Dao values guarding softness as strength,
Thus it endures without peril.

If one uses force to dominate the world,
This is to abandon softness and employ strength—
Strength must age,
Then it is merely a thing—
How can this be the Dao’s way of transforming things?

Hence it is said:
Things grow strong then age—
This is called not the Dao.
Not the Dao, it perishes early.

**Chapter Thirty: On Fine Arms**
Fine arms are an inauspicious instrument,
Things detest and abhor them—
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

The gentleman at home values the left,
In war values the right.

Arms are an inauspicious instrument,
Not the instrument of the gentleman—
Used only when unavoidable,
With calmness as the highest virtue.

To win yet not rejoice in it,
Yet to rejoice is to delight in killing.

Those who delight in killing
Cannot achieve their desires in the world.

Auspicious matters favor the left,
Inauspicious matters favor the right.
The left general commands the left,
The right general commands the right—
Speaking of treating war as a funeral rite.

When many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.
When victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.

The Classic says:
The cultured observe and the martial conceal—
This is the way of Heaven and Earth,
The principle of yin and yang.

To praise arms is to dwell upon the inauspicious,
To dwell upon what things abhor—
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

Therefore the gentleman at home values the left,
In war values the right—
Their priorities differ from ordinary times,
For they dwell upon an inauspicious instrument,
Not the instrument of the gentleman.

It is not that one delights in it—only when necessity compels does one employ it. Serenity and simplicity are supreme, hence victory is not glorified.

It is not that one delights in it—Heaven will save it, shielding it with benevolence. Benevolence is what Heaven delights to promote without wearying of. Then, those who kill—how could they not delight in it? Yet to glorify it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their desires in the world.

Thus auspicious matters favor the left,
Inauspicious matters favor the right.
The left general commands the left,
The right general commands the right—
Speaking of treating war as a funeral rite.
When many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.
When victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.

If war is treated as a funeral rite, then it is clear that this is an inauspicious instrument and not glorified.
If one mourns with sorrowful weeping, then it is clear that one does not delight in killing.

The Master’s understanding of ritual learning is thus, yet those who say the Master abolished ritual learning—do they truly know his intent in abolishing it?

**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**
The Dao ever nameless—though simple, the world dares not submit to it.
If lords and kings could guard it, all things would come as guests.
Heaven and Earth unite, descending sweet dew—
None commands it, yet all is balanced.
When naming first arose, names were established.
Then one must know when to stop—
Knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.

The Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.
The Classic says:
"The Dao ever nameless—
To name it *the* Dao is to contradict it.
When it is nameless, nothing yet exists.
Its simplicity is truly small,
Yet the world dares not submit to it—why?
Heaven and Earth rely on it to begin,
All things depend on it to live—
Who in the world would dare to submit to their own origin and their own life?
This is called the True Sovereign.
All things have their True Sovereign—this is the meaning.
If lords and kings could guard it,
They would rule all things as True Sovereigns—
Who would have their True Sovereign and not submit?
Thus it is said:
The Sage acts, and all things observe.
Extreme yin is solemn, extreme yang is radiant—
Solemn arises from Heaven, radiant issues from Earth.
The two interact, forming harmony, and thus things are born.
Some record it, yet its form is unseen.
When Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew,
This is the peak of their interaction and harmony.
Lords and kings grasp the Dao’s record, and all things submit to them—
Yet who can see its form?
Thus none commands it, yet all is balanced.

The nameless simplicity—no thought, no action.
When the artisan acts, naming first arises, and names are established.
At this time, one must know when to stop—
Then it is easy to hold, unmanifested is easy to plan,
Fragile is easy to shatter, subtle is easy to disperse.
Act before it exists, govern before it is disordered—
Then what beginning will there be?
This is the way lords and kings guard it.

The Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas—
Could there be anything that does not return to it?

**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**
Knowing others is wisdom,
Self-knowledge is clarity.
Overcoming others requires strength,
Overcoming oneself is power.
Contentment brings wealth,
Persistent action fulfills ambition.
Not losing what one holds ensures longevity,
Dying without perishing ensures true life.

The Classic says:
Knowing others is wisdom, self-knowledge is clarity—
Only by knowing oneself can one know others,
Thus clarity is the source of wisdom.
Overcoming others requires strength, overcoming oneself is power—
Only by overcoming oneself can one overcome others,
Thus power is the source of strength.
Returning to the constant is called "command,"
And knowing the constant is called "clarity."
Unable to know oneself, one cannot know the constant—
Thus knowing the constant is the way to know oneself.
When clarity reaches self-knowledge,
What more is there to knowing others?

Guarding softness is strength—
Engaging others in contention, daily battling with the heart,
This is not how to guard softness.
Thus guarding softness is the way to overcome oneself.
When power reaches overcoming oneself,
What more is there to the Sage?

With self-knowledge’s clarity,
One knows all things are complete within oneself,
Requiring no external emulation—
Thus it is said: Contentment brings wealth.
With overcoming oneself’s power,
One only strives diligently in the Dao,
Seeking nothing from others—
Thus it is said: Persistent action fulfills ambition.
Knowing sufficiency within oneself and striving persistently,
One can preserve what must be preserved,
And not be swayed by external things—
Thus it is said: Not losing what one holds ensures longevity.
Preserving what must be preserved,
Even in death, one does not perish—
Thus it is said: Dying without perishing ensures true life.

**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**
The Great Dao flows—
It can be turned left or right.
All things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse.
When the work is done, it does not dwell upon it.
It clothes all things yet does not claim lordship.
Ever without desire, it may be called small;
All things return to it, yet it does not know lordship—
It may be called great.
Thus the Sage never claims greatness,
And so achieves true greatness.

The Classic says:
It can be turned left, yet not right,
It can be turned right, yet not left—
In things, one-sidedness is not the Great Dao.
The Great Dao is present everywhere,
Thus it flows—it can be turned left or right.
Whatever is great cannot be called small,
Small cannot be called great.
This Dao, because it can be turned left or right,
Thus all things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse.
When the work is done, it does not dwell upon it,
It clothes all things yet does not claim lordship.
Only because it does not dwell, does not claim lordship,
Is it ever without desire.
Ever without desire is the pinnacle of subtlety,
Thus it may be called small.

All things return to it yet know no lord—
Thus it is the utmost in receptivity,
And so may be called great.

Though great, it may still be called small,
Yet if small, it may still be called great—
Neither great nor small,
This is why the Dao hides in the Nameless.

Yet truly, the Dao’s greatness lies not in being great.
The Sage embodies the Dao,
And so his ability to achieve greatness
Does not come from himself.

**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**

Grasp the Great Symbol, and all under heaven will come.
Come, yet cause no harm—
Peace, security, and ease prevail.
Delight in bait, and travelers will stop.

The Dao spoken of is insipid, without taste.
Look upon it, and it cannot be seen;
Listen to it, and it cannot be heard;
Use it, and it cannot be exhausted.

The Classic says:
The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas—
All things return to it yet know no lord,
This is formlessness.
Formlessness is the Great Symbol—
Who then could preserve themselves and not follow?

Thus it is said: Grasp the Great Symbol, and all under heaven will come.
If one loses the Dao and all under heaven comes,
Then depart—
Yet even then, their coming will cause harm.
If one holds to the Dao and all under heaven comes,
Though they forget themselves in its unfolding,
They will never truly separate—
Thus they come without harm, in peace, security, and ease.

Peace is the utmost of security,
Ease is the utmost of peace.
If there is delight to be delighted in,
If there is bait to be craved,
Then those who stop are but passing travelers.

The Dao spoken of is insipid, its essence pure—
Not bait to be craved;
Look upon it, and it cannot be seen;
Listen to it, and it cannot be heard—
Not delight to be delighted in.
If such is the case, how could it be exhausted?
Travelers stop, yet it is but a thatched hut for them—
Not something to be endured long.
That it cannot be exhausted is why the people use it daily without knowing,
And peace, security, and ease arise from it—
How much more than mere travelers stopping?

**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Welcoming and Withdrawing**

To those who would gather, first spread wide;
To those who would weaken, first strengthen;
To those who would destroy, first nurture;
To those who would take, first give.

This is called subtle clarity.
The soft overcomes the hard—
Fish cannot escape the depths,
And the sharpest tools of a state
Must not be shown to others.

The Classic says:
To those who would gather, first spread wide;
To those who would weaken, first strengthen;
To those who would destroy, first nurture;
To those who would take, first give.

The Way of Heaven, the nature of things,
The affairs of humankind—
Their momentum has never been otherwise.
From strength, know withdrawal;
From hardness, know softness;
From flourishing, know decay;
From giving, know taking.
Who but the wise in omens could comprehend this?

Thus it is said: This is called subtle clarity.
Yet those who can gather, spread, weaken, strengthen,
Destroy, nurture, take, and give—
Are formless and soft.
What they gather, spread, weaken, strengthen,
Destroy, nurture, take, and give—
Are formed and hard.
Thus the victory of soft over hard is clear.

Humans cannot depart from softness,
Just as fish cannot escape the depths.
Fish escaping the depths are caught—
Humans departing from softness are but doomed to death.

The utmost softness in the world
Ranges over the utmost hardness,
Yet nothing enters the unquestioned.
Ranging over the utmost hardness while entering the unquestioned—
This is the sharpest of tools.
To wield sharp tools in governing the world and states,
One’s schemes must always lie in the formless realm—
How could one make others know their origin?

Thus it is said: The sharpest tools of a state
Must not be shown to others.

**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Uncarved**

The Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would transform of themselves.
When transformation stirs to act,
I will restrain it with the Uncarved Primordial.

The Uncarved Primordial will then desire nothing.
Desiring nothing, it remains still—
All under heaven will align of itself.

The Classic says:
All things have names,
Yet the Dao is ever nameless—
Thus named things are all its guests.
Hence it is said: All things will align as guests,
And this is spoken of through the Nameless.

Still, this is but knowing non-action.
Non-action yet nothing remains undone—
Then there is no true non-action.
Thus all things transform of themselves.
When they transform, I and all things are none but the Dao—
Who knows the guests and their hosting?

Thus when they align as guests,
Names are first established.
Names once established,
They will know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop,
They return to the Uncarved Primordial.

When they transform and stir to act,
I will restrain them with the Uncarved Primordial—
Yet the Uncarved Primordial itself will desire nothing.
The Uncarved Primordial desires nothing—
This is not merely non-action,
Nor has there ever been true non-action.

All movement under heaven
Is but the rectification of the One.
If lords and kings guard the Dao to this extent,
They may be said to desire nothing and remain still—
How could all under heaven fail to align?

The Old Master was truly a sage,
Yet why did he not tirelessly attend to all things under heaven,
But instead exhort lords and kings with such earnestness?
The Dao, when cultivated for oneself, is true;
When cultivated for all under heaven, it is universal.
If lords and kings know and guard it,
Then cultivating for all under heaven is truly universal.

To proclaim the Dao without sound
Yet wish to harmonize with all under heaven—this is benevolence.
To wish to harmonize with all under heaven
Yet first instruct lords and kings—this is righteousness.

Yet scholars, seeing his words as utterly rejecting and abandoning propriety and righteousness, say, *"The Old Master tramples upon and belittles my benevolence and righteousness—I do not accept this."* Alas, they do not perceive the intent behind his rejection, so it is fitting that they reject it.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: On the Virtue of the Highest Virtue Not Being Virtue**

The highest virtue does not act as virtue,
And thus it truly is virtue.
The lower virtue clings to virtue,
And thus it is not virtue.

The highest virtue acts without contrivance,
And yet there is nothing to contrive.
The lower virtue acts with contrivance,
And thus there is much to contrive.

The highest benevolence acts without contrivance,
And yet there is nothing to contrive.
The highest righteousness acts with contrivance,
And thus there is much to contrive.

The highest ritual acts with contrivance,
Yet none respond—
Then it raises its arm and forces compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, ritual arises.

Ritual is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Prescience is but the flower of the Dao,
And the start of folly.

Therefore, the true sage abides in the thick, not the thin,
In the real, not the superficial—
Thus he discards the latter and embraces the former.

The transmission says:
*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao—*
Then how could the common man possess it?

The highest virtue, by having no gain, attains gain.
Only because it has no gain
Is it able to attain gain—
Thus it is said: *The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus it truly is virtue.*

The lower virtue, by not losing virtue, attains gain.
Only because it does not lose virtue
Does it, though gaining, lack true virtue—
Thus it is said: *The lower virtue clings to virtue, and thus it is not virtue.*

The highest virtue acts without contrivance,
Not because it deliberately avoids action,
But because virtue’s own nature spontaneously requires nothing.

The lower virtue does not understand this,
And thus must contrive—
Hence, it cannot avoid contrivance.

Virtue, by requiring nothing, is sufficient.
Yet if benevolence is added,
Then it is contrived.

But the highest benevolence, in its benevolence,
Requires no transformation—
Thus it acts without contrivance.

Benevolence cannot stand alone,
And thus righteousness must be present.
Even the highest righteousness cannot avoid action—
Thus it acts with contrivance.

Benevolence is merely giving,
But righteousness chooses what is fitting to give,
Without demanding reciprocity.

Ritual demands reciprocity—
To receive without giving is not ritual,
To give without receiving is also not ritual.
This is the principle of ritual.

The highest ritual acts with contrivance,
Yet none respond—
Then it raises its arm and forces compliance,
For though they do not respond,
It still does not abandon ritual to enforce ritual—
Such is the natural order.

The highest benevolence, highest righteousness, and highest ritual are thus—
Then what of their lesser counterparts? It is self-evident.

From this, we see:
When the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, ritual arises—
Is this not the truth?

Ritual’s demands for reciprocity are so great
That loyalty and trust grow thin,
And contention begins—
Thus, though ritual is meant to govern chaos,
It is also the source of chaos.

Prescience, though it employs wisdom,
Is the beginning of folly.

Why is this?
Human governance arises from substance,
Substance is nature,
Thinness is artifice—
To abandon nature for artifice
Is to invite chaos.

Human self-awareness lies in clarity,
Clarity reveals the real,
Wisdom is but its flower—
To abandon the real for the superficial
Is to invite folly.

Thus, the true sage abides in the thick, not the thin,
In the real, not the superficial—
And so he forgets benevolence and righteousness,
Discards ritual and learning,
Abandons wisdom,
And aspires to the complete Dao of virtue—
This is called discarding the latter and embracing the former.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On the Ancient Possession of the One**

Those who in ancient times possessed the One—
The heavens, by possessing the One, were clear;
The earth, by possessing the One, was tranquil;
The spirit, by possessing the One, was numinous;
The valleys, by possessing the One, were full;
All things, by possessing the One, lived;
Lords and kings, by possessing the One, were steadfast for all under heaven.

If the heavens did not possess the One, they would crack;
If the earth did not possess the One, it would erupt;
If the spirit did not possess the One, it would perish;
If the valleys did not possess the One, they would dry;
If all things did not possess the One, they would die;
If lords and kings did not possess the One, their nobility would falter.

Thus, nobility relies on humility as its root,
And height relies on lowliness as its foundation.
Hence, lords and kings call themselves *"lonely, few, and unworthy"*—
Is this not taking humility as root?

Is it not so?

Thus, true honor comes without praise,
And one does not desire to be polished like jade
Or rough like stone.

The transmission says:
*The Dao is singular—*
Yet to possess it is to separate from it,
And thus it is no longer one.

Only by possessing it without possessing it
Is it called possessing the One.

Those who in ancient times possessed the One
Were all thus.

To look upward, the heavens—
By possessing the One, they were clear,
And thus they cover all without tipping.

To look downward, the earth—
By possessing the One, they were tranquil,
And thus they bear all without sinking.

The spirit is formless and utterly still—
By possessing the One, it is wondrously alive and numinous.

The valleys are form-filled yet utterly empty—
By possessing the One, they respond to stimuli and are full.

All things, in their multitude—
By possessing the One, they live without end.

The most exalted, the lords and kings—
By possessing the One, they govern all movement under heaven and remain steadfast.

Thus, the One is what the heavens rely upon to be clear,
What the earth relies upon to be tranquil,
What stillness relies upon to be numinous,
What emptiness relies upon to be full,
What all things rely upon to live,
And what lords and kings rely upon to be steadfast for all under heaven.

If the heavens did not possess the One, they would crack;
If the earth did not possess the One, it would erupt;
If the spirit did not possess the One, it would perish;
If the valleys did not possess the One, they would dry;
If all things did not possess the One, they would die;
And if lords and kings did not possess the One,
Yet only valued nobility and height—
Do they not know that this would lead to ruin?

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as its foundation,
Yet without this foundation, there is no nobility—
For this is how nobility establishes itself.

The lofty relies on the low as its base,
Yet without this base, there is no height—
For this is how height arises.

Then, if one is noble yet lacks true nobility,
Or lofty yet lacks true height—
Is this not how lords and kings remain steadfast for all under heaven without ruin?

Thus, the solitary, the orphaned, the childless—
Though detested and held in contempt by people,
Those who claim nobility and height do so
Because their foundation lies here.

Therefore, when one attains the utmost and exhausts it,
Reaching the One,
Then nobility does not differ from lowliness,
And lowliness does not depart from height—
And praise arises from the absence of praise.

When praise lacks distinction, then slander lacks distinction.
When praise lacks distinction, it cannot be attained as nobility;
When slander lacks distinction, it cannot be attained as lowliness.
Jade is valued, so it is polished green;
Stone is despised, so it is cast aside.
Yet if one does not polish it green like jade,
Or cast it aside like stone—
Then nobility and lowliness cannot be distinguished.

**Chapter Forty: The Movement of Dao in Reversal**
The movement of Dao lies in reversal;
Its use lies in weakness.

All things under heaven are born of *You* (having),
And *You* is born of *Wu* (non-being).

The Classic says:
*"Dao circulates through all things, not ceasing to move,
Yet its motion ever lies in reversal—
This is called the pivot finding its central pivot,
Responding to the boundless."*

It moves through heaven and earth, not without strength,
Yet its use ever lies in weakness—
This is called the utmost softness traversing the utmost firmness,
With nothing entering the unyielding.

Thus, all things under heaven are born of *You*,
And *You* is born of *Wu*.
Only *You* can give birth to all things under heaven,
And *Wu* can give birth to all *You*—
Therefore, the movement of Dao lies in reversal,
And its use lies in weakness—this is now clear.

Thus, to reverse and to weaken is no other thing
Than to attain the One and exhaust it in *Wu*.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao**

The superior man hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
The middle man hears the Dao and holds it as if it were there, as if it were not;
The inferior man hears the Dao and laughs greatly—
For if he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.

The ancient sayings state:
*"The bright Dao seems obscure,
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreating,
Leveling in the Dao seems like disorder,
The highest virtue seems like a valley,
The greatest whiteness seems like a stain,
The broadest virtue seems insufficient,
Establishing virtue seems like theft,
True simplicity seems corrupted,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel is fashioned late,
The greatest sound is faint,
The greatest form is shapeless,
The Dao is hidden and nameless."*

Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.

The Classic says:
*"Confucius said: If one hears the Dao in the morning,
One may die in the evening—it is enough."*

Thus, for those who hear the Dao, life and death cannot weigh upon their hearts—
How could they merely know it superficially?

The superior man hears the Dao—
Truly hearing it, he has no further doubt,
Only moving and acting upon it.

How does the Dao move and act?
By daily observing the heart to align with what is heard—
This is called diligent practice.

The middle man hears the Dao—
He hears it yet does not fully grasp it,
Thus, it seems present, then absent.
If it seems present, then absent,
He cannot diligently practice it—
He merely emerges and withdraws.

The inferior man hears the Dao—
He hears it yet does not believe it,
Thus, he laughs greatly.
He laughs greatly because he seeks it with his emotions and finds nothing.
If the Dao could be sought with emotions, he would not laugh—
Thus, it is said: *"If he does not laugh, it is not the Dao."*

As the ancients said,
All these cannot be sought with emotions—
In the murky depths, one alone sees clarity,
In the silence, one alone hears harmony—
This is called *"the bright Dao seems obscure."*

Harmonizing with right and wrong,
Resting in the balance of heaven,
Nothing is contrary, nothing is impossible—
This is called *"leveling in the Dao seems like disorder."*

Practicing the Dao daily,
Diminishing, diminishing again,
Until reaching *Wuwei* (non-action)—
This is called *"advancing in the Dao seems like retreating."*

The highest virtue is *Wuwei* yet without striving—
Yet its response is swift, like an echo—
Is this not like a valley?

The greatest whiteness is pure, without blemish—
Yet it receives all the filth of the world—
Is this not like a stain?

The broadest virtue encompasses all without limit—
Yet it never boasts, never asserts itself—
Is this not like insufficiency?

The one who well establishes virtue does not uproot—
Yet establishes it with the constant *Wu* (non-being),
Not with fixed certainty—
Thus, it is said: *"Establishing virtue seems like theft."*

Embodying nature, embracing spirit,
Moving through the world’s concerns without being startled—
Thus, it is said: *"True simplicity seems corrupted."*

The greatest square has no fixed orientation—
South and north dissolve, boundaries vanish,
Sinking into the unfathomable,
East and west begin in the primordial darkness,
Returning to the great openness—
This is the *"great square having no corners."*

The greatest vessel seems incomplete—
Yet daily calculations find it lacking,
Annual calculations find it abundant—
This is the *"great vessel fashioned late."*

The greatest sound is inaudible when heard—
Thus, it is faint in voice.
The greatest form is invisible when seen—
Thus, it is shapeless.

All these are the Dao.
Yet calling it bright seems obscure,
Calling it level seems like disorder,
Calling it advancing seems like retreating—
Down to the sound being faint, the form being shapeless—
Name and reality are ever as opposites,
Thus, the Dao is hidden in the nameless,
And when named, it is ever as opposites.

Only the Dao can be thus—
Therefore, it is good at lending and completing.
It gives to others, yet the more it gives, the more it possesses;
It nurtures and rears, lengthens and matures, completes and ripens, nourishes and shelters—
All this is the Dao.
Thus, it is said: *"Only the Dao is good at lending and completing."*

**Chapter Forty-Two: Dao Gives Birth to the One**

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Softness of the Dao**

The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to the myriad things.

The myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within,
Their harmony comes from the interplay of *chong* and *qi*.
What people detest—
The solitary, the childless, the barren—
Are the titles of kings and lords.

Thus, things sometimes benefit by loss,
And are harmed by gain.
What people teach,
Is also what I teach as *yi*.
The strong and violent
Shall not meet their end.
I shall take this as my teacher.

The Classic says:
In the world, there is none that can pair with the Dao,
And if none can pair with it, then it is One alone.
Thus, it is said: *The Dao gives birth to One.*
Once called One,
Then the naming and the named become Two—
Thus, it is said: *One gives birth to Two.*
When there is One and Two,
Then there is Three—
Thus, it is said: *Two gives birth to Three.*
Therefore, only the nameless is complete;
If named as One,
Then it reaches as far as Three,
And Three established, the myriad things are born—
Thus, it is said: *Three gives birth to the myriad things.*

The hidden and unfathomable—
This is yin.
The bright and visible—
This is yang.
All that is born
Turns its back to the hidden, unfathomable yin,
And faces the bright, visible yang—
Thus, it is said: *The myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within.*
To bear is to turn away,
To embrace is to face.

Yet, it must be the interplay of *chong* and *qi* to bring harmony.
For yin and yang are Two,
And *chong* and *qi* are One—
Without this One, nothing could be born.
Thus, what people desire—
Are carriages, caps, wealth, and nobility—
Yet what they detest—
Are solitude, childlessness, and barrenness.
When carriages and caps adorn the body,
They are not one’s nature and life,
But things that come and go like transient guests—
Yet if one clings to them as if they were permanent,
Then one clings to yang and forgets to return to yin,
The most extreme case.

The ancients established names,
Using what people detest as the titles of kings and lords,
So that the noble would not forget the lowly,
The high would not forget the low,
That one would know what to bear and what to embrace,
What to face and what to return to—
All to avoid losing the harmony of *chong* and One.

Thus, things sometimes benefit by loss,
And are harmed by gain.
Fullness invites ruin,
Humility invites increase—
This is the Way of Heaven.

What people teach,
Is also what I teach as *yi*.
What I teach is the Dao—
To teach without *yi* is not the Dao.

Only those who align with the Dao attain One,
Attain One, and there is no self.
No self, no striving.
Only those who do not strive
Cannot be contended with by the world—
The opposite leads only to death.

The noble’s teaching of others,
Though sometimes differing,
Yet all return to One and no self—
This is where teaching originates.
Thus, it is said: *The strong and violent shall not meet their end.*
I shall take this as my teacher.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness in the World**

The supreme softness in the world
Drives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world.
There is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—
Thus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.

The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefits of *wuwei*—
Few in the world can attain them.

The Classic says:
The supreme softness in the world
Drives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world—
Observing things, water is such.
There is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—
Observing things, *qi* is such.

Water, through its softness and weakness,
Approaches the Dao,
Yet it cannot be without form—
Still, it can attack the firm and strong,
And none can surpass it.

*Qi*, through its lack of substance,
Aligns with the spirit,
Yet it cannot be without *qi*—
Still, it can enter where there is no gap.
How much more so the supreme softness,
The *Taiyi* before *qi* took form—
With this, it drives and conquers the supreme firmness,
And enters where there is no gap—
Who would not be moved?
And who would not find their own way?

Thus, it is said: *I know the benefits of wuwei.*
Yet the teaching of the unsaid,
The benefits of *wuwei*—
Few in the world can attain them,
For they do not know how to return to their origin.

**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**

The great fullness seems as if deficient,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
The great excess seems as if empty,
Yet its use is unending.
The greatest straightness seems as if bent,
The greatest skill seems as if clumsy,
The greatest eloquence seems as if tongue-tied.

The restless overcomes cold,
The tranquil overcomes heat,
The clear and tranquil are the rectification of the world.

The Classic says:
All things begin here and end here—
This is the great fullness.
Yet it begins with no beginning,
Ends with no end,
Thus, it seems as if deficient.

**Chapter Forty-Six: The Great Fullness as if Deficient (Continued)**

It is because of its apparent deficiency that its use renews daily without exhaustion.
All things draw from it yet are never depleted—this is the great fullness.
Yet when added to, it does not grow more abundant, hence its emptiness.
It is because of its emptiness that its use is ever-sufficient without end.

The greatest straightness bends to preserve itself,
And what is bent is made straight—
Thus, it seems as if crooked.
The greatest skill carves myriad forms yet does not flaunt its art—
Thus, it seems as if clumsy.
The greatest eloquence speaks without words—
Thus, it seems as if tongue-tied.
So it is—no other reason—
For all things have their root.

What is this root?
Now, cold and heat are what Heaven and Earth produce,
What all things cannot escape,
Yet a single surge of agitation can overcome cold,
And a single moment of stillness can overcome heat.
If such fleeting agitation and tranquility
Can prevail over Heaven and Earth’s workings,
Then how much more so
The body’s natural stillness and clarity,
Which rectify the world—
Where would it not triumph?

Thus, when speaking of its completion,
It seems deficient yet never exhausted;
When speaking of its fullness,
It seems empty yet never depleted.
Its straightness bends yet extends,
Its skill seems clumsy yet is refined,
Its eloquence seems stammering yet is clear—
This is called having root.

**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony**

When the Way prevails in the world,
Warhorses are driven back to manure.
When the Way is lost in the world,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No crime is greater than desiring what is desirable,
No calamity greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No fault greater than seeking to obtain.
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.

The Classic says:
When the Way prevails in the world,
The people’s wisdom and skill are confined to tilling and eating,
While theft and strife vanish in the absence of desire—
And their deaths are as natural as shedding old skin.
Thus, it is said: *"Warhorses are driven back to manure."*

When the Way is lost in the world,
Desire for what is desirable becomes the root of warfare,
And even borders cannot secure peace—
Thus, it is said: *"Warhorses breed in the suburbs."*

Then whence do crimes arise?
From desiring what is desirable—
Hence, *"No crime is greater than desiring what is desirable."*

Because of desiring what is desirable,
One does not know sufficiency,
And though there is abundance, one does not cease—
Moderation brings blessing, excess brings ruin.
Hence, *"No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency."*

Because of not knowing sufficiency,
One seeks to obtain,
And when desire is fulfilled,
Resentment and blame are invited,
And war never ends—
Hence, *"No fault is greater than seeking to obtain."*

Thus, the one who does not know sufficiency,
Though abundant, is never satisfied—
But he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.

---

**Chapter Forty-Seven: The Unseen Knowing**

Without stepping outside,
One knows the world;
Without peering through windows,
One sees the Way of Heaven.

The farther one goes,
The less one knows.
Thus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,
Sees without looking yet names,
Accomplishes without doing.

The Classic says:
What is it that makes the world the world?
To know how the world becomes the world,
One need not step outside to know it.
What is it that makes the Way of Heaven the Way of Heaven?
To see how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,
One need not peer through windows to see it.

Now, the world is vast and boundless—
If one waits to go out before knowing it,
How few will be the places one’s strength can reach,
And how little will one truly know?
The Way of Heaven is distant and unfathomable—
If one waits to peer before seeing it,
How few will be the sights one’s eyes can grasp,
And how little will one truly see?

Thus, it is said:
*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*

Therefore, the Sage knows how the world becomes the world,
And so acts without moving yet knows;
Sees how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,
And so names without looking.
Why?
Because it is already complete within.

To know what cannot be traveled,
To name what cannot be seen,
Is to accomplish without doing.

---

**Chapter Forty-Eight: The Learning of the Way**

Learning increases daily,
The Way decreases daily.
Decrease it again and again,
Until one reaches *wuwei*—
And in *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.

Thus, to take the world is always through non-action,
Yet when action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.

The Classic says:
The learner has not yet heard the Way,
And in seeking it, cannot avoid striving—
Hence, *"increase."*
The one who practices the Way has already heard it,
And in practicing, aims only at *wuwei*—
Hence, *"decrease."*

Yet even in decreasing, one is not free of action,
So decrease the very act of decreasing,
And only then does one reach *wuwei*.
*Wuwei* is simply being without contrivance.
To do without doing is to transcend all lack—
This is called *"abandoning learning, free of care."*

Free of care is called *shen*—
*Shen* is that which nurtures all things yet is not a thing—
Then what need has it of the world?
From this perspective,
To take the world is always through non-action,
Yet when action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.

Observe how Zhuang Zhou responded to emperors and kings,
And through deep inquiry, this may be understood.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Heart**

The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The good, I treat as good;
The ungood, I also treat as good—
Thus, virtue is good.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus, virtue is trust.

The Sage in the world
Murmurs softly, blending the hearts of the people.
All the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,
And the Sage treats them as children.

The Classic says:
Is the human heart so divine?
Hold it, and it exists;
Release it, and it vanishes.
It enters and exits without measure,
And none can trace its path.
To hold it is to preserve it,
To release it is to lose it—
Thus, it has no fixed form to measure.
It enters and exits without time,
And cannot be sought in past or future—
Thus, it cannot be confined to a place.
If the heart is so,
Then the human heart is likewise.

The Sage first attains the exhaustion of my heart,
Thus he has no fixed heart,
But takes the hearts of the people as his own—
Like a mirror with no fixed form,
Yet taking the forms of all it reflects as its own.

Thus, when the Sage views his own heart,
He views the hearts of the people in the same way—
Then how could there be any fixed distinction
Between good and ungood, trust and untrust?

Therefore, the good I treat as good,
The ungood I also treat as good—
Knowing that their hearts’ good and ungood are without constancy,
Yet acting with virtue as good.

The trustworthy I trust,
The untrustworthy I also trust—
Knowing that their hearts’ trust and untrust are without constancy,
Yet acting with virtue as trust.

When things attain the power to generate life, it is called *virtue*;
When form and body preserve the spirit, each abiding by its proper measure, it is called *nature*.

When *nature* is cultivated and returns to *virtue*,
And *virtue* reaches the state of its origin,
Then *virtue* is what *nature* itself produces—
Thus, the absence of ungood and untrust is clearly evident.

The Sage in the world
Flutters ceaselessly, blending the hearts of the people.
To blend their hearts means
To let the trustworthy and good not regard themselves as different,
And to let the ungood and untrustworthy not abandon themselves.

All the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,
Following only the Sage’s vision and hearing,
And the Sage treats them as children.

To treat them as children means
To meet them with kindness,
To regard them with generosity—
Even if they are ungood and untrustworthy,
Yet still treating them as good and trustworthy,
Knowing that their hearts are without constancy, just as his own.

**Chapter Fifty: The Chapter of Birth and Death**
Birth and death—
There are thirteen aspects of birth,
And thirteen aspects of death.
Human life is but a movement toward death.

Why is this so?
Because life’s abundance is the cause of death.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life
Walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle yet are not struck by weapons.

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger no place to strike with its claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.

Why is this so?
Because there is no place of death for them.

The transmission says:
Those who live are but companions of death,
Those who die are the beginning of life—
Thus life and death are but interdependent, entering and exiting one another.

The thirteen aspects of life’s companionship
Come from life yielding life—
Not a matter of fortunate birth.

The thirteen aspects of death’s companionship
Come from death yielding death—
Not a matter of unfortunate demise.

When people move toward death’s thirteen aspects,
The leopard nourishes within while the tiger devours without,
The strong nourish without while illness assaults within—
Not because they do not value life,
But because they fail to grasp the Dao,
And thus move toward death’s domain.

Why is this so?
Because their life is too abundant.

Those who obtain life through life,
And death through death—
This need not be discussed.
But those who cling to life
And yet fall into death’s domain—
Their error lies here.

It is said that those skilled in nurturing life
Walk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,
Enter battle yet are not struck by weapons.

The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger no place to strike with its claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.

Why is this so?
Because there is no place of death for them.

Laozi’s words on this matter are profound yet seem paradoxical,
Spoken to provoke doubt, heard to question—
Why so?

Is this what Zhuangzi called "weighty words"?

Let us examine it:

The reason people encounter tigers and rhinoceroses,
Or are struck by weapons,
And why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons can harm—
Is because of the self.

Now, if I examine my heart and find no fixed abode,
Then my heart is unattainable.
If my heart is unattainable,
Then my body and the world are also unattainable.
Within, I see no self;
Without, I see no things—
Then who or what is the place of death?

Who or what are the tiger, rhinoceros, and weapons
To thrust their horns, strike with claws, or lodge their blades?

Then, if one is skilled in nurturing life—
What more could be added to this?

**Chapter Fifty: "The Dao Gives Birth"**

The Dao gives birth to it,
Virtue nurtures it,
Things shape it,
Circumstances complete it—
Thus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.

The Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—
None bestow them, yet they abide naturally.

Thus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, rears, completes, matures, and shelters.
It gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Nurtures yet does not dominate—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

The Classic says:
All things’ birth stems from the Nameless,
Yet their nurturing abides in the One, still unformed,
At the moment when things gain life.
The Nameless is the Dao.
The One, still unformed, yet giving life—this is virtue.

When they become things, they are merely shaped,
Not the source of their birth and nurturing.
Once formed, the naked must remain naked,
The scaly, the shelled, the feathered, the furred—
Each must be scaly, shelled, feathered, or furred,
And from youth to old age and death—
All this is the inevitable unfolding of circumstances.
Thus it is said:
*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete.*

Yet circumstances arise from form,
Form from virtue,
Virtue from the Dao.
The Dao and virtue are the root;
Form and circumstances are the branches.
The root is honored, the branches lowly;
The root is noble, the branches base—
Thus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.

The Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—
None bestow them, yet they abide naturally.
This is how the uncarved block’s softness and weakness
Can overcome the rigidity and strength of form and circumstances—
Thus kings and lords transform the world
Not through this, but through that.

Though it is said:
*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete,*
When speaking of the root,
To give birth, to nurture, to rear, to complete, to mature, to shelter—
All are the Dao.
Yet the Dao remains nameless,
Thus it is said:
*It gives birth yet does not possess,
Acts yet does not rely,
Nurtures yet does not dominate—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.*

**Chapter Fifty-Two: "The Origin of the World"**

The world has its origin,
Which becomes the world’s mother.
Having obtained its mother,
One knows its children;
Having known its children,
One returns to guard its mother—
And thus the body perishes not.

Close the senses’ openings,
Shut the gates—
And one’s life is never weary.
Open the senses’ openings,
Pursue affairs—
And one’s life is never saved.

To see what is small is called clarity;
To hold fast to softness is called strength.
Using its radiance,
Then returning to its clarity—
No calamity befalls the body—
This is called *Clinging to the Constant.*

The Classic says:
*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother—*
This is what the Classic calls *"The Dao, whose name I do not know."*

The Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Yet the Dao, though nameless, is the world’s mother—
Why?
Because the Named is merely the mother of all things,
But not the mother of the world.
The Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth,
And all beneath heaven spring from it—
Thus it is said:
*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother.*

To hear the Dao is easy;
To obtain the Dao is difficult.
To obtain the Dao is easy;
To guard the Dao is difficult.

Now that I have obtained its mother
And aligned it with my heart—
Not merely heard—
I know all things beneath heaven are my own emergence.
Knowing all things beneath heaven are my own emergence,
And yet I guard it without loss—
Who beneath heaven could harm what emerges from itself?
This is how one serves the body without peril.

Close the senses’ openings,
Shut the gates—
And one’s life is never weary—
This is guarding its mother.
When the heart stirs within and I indulge it—
This is called *having openings.*
With openings, the heart departs and engages things;
I close the openings and do not pass through—
Not passing through, the heart does not depart.
When things draw me outward and I receive them—
This is called *having gates.*
With gates, things enter and disturb the heart;
I shut the gates and do not receive—
Not receiving, things do not enter.
Within, nothing departs;
Without, nothing enters—
Though myriad transformations teem before me,
Each returns to its root, unknown—
What weariness is there?

The ancients could abandon the heart and employ the form—
Through this Dao.

If one opens the openings and does not close them,
Pursues affairs and does not cease—
Then the heart becomes a mere lodging for things,
With nowhere to guard itself—
What reliance could prevent ruin?
This is why one’s life is never saved.

Only those who guard its mother
Perceive the heart’s stirrings in their subtlest motion
And remain still, unmoved.
Still and unmoved, yet responsive—
Thus the world’s patterns flow through them—
Hence it is said:
*To see what is small is called clarity.*
To hold fast to the formless ultimate softness—
No thing can overcome it—
Hence it is said:
*To hold fast to softness is called strength.*
Having used its radiance to illuminate its stirrings,
Then returning to its clarity to revert to stillness—
Never opening the openings, never pursuing affairs—
How could calamity befall?
Thus one clings to the harmony of knowing,
Deep yet unseen—
Hence it is said:
*Using its radiance, returning to its clarity—
No calamity befalls the body—
This is called Clinging to the Constant.*

---

**Chapter Fifty-Three: "If I Were to Be Rigid"**

If I were rigidly knowing,
Walking the Great Dao,
I would fear only *action.*

The Great Dao is most level,
Yet people love shortcuts.
Morning halls are swept clean,
Fields grow overgrown,
Granaries lie empty—
Fine silks adorn the body,
Sharp swords gird the waist,
Feasts glut the palate,
Wealth overflows—
This is called *robber’s splendor,*
Not the Dao.

The Classic says:
The gentleman’s approach to the Dao
Cannot be without earnestness.
The heart, restrained with no excess,
Though myriad changes array themselves—
They cannot disturb my stillness—
What is there to fear in action?

If I cannot restrain my heart,
Yet rigidly knowing walk the Great Dao,
I would fear only *action,*
Seeking to traverse it safely—
This is impossible,
Much less for those who open the openings
And pursue affairs.

The essence of the Great Dao lies in its nature—
to know without knowing,
and thus attain the utmost levelness.
Yet people seek it with deliberate knowledge,
loving shortcuts while unaware of the path.

Life’s foundation is food,
and food must come from the fields.
When fields are tended, granaries are full;
when granaries are full, food suffices;
when food suffices, wealth abounds;
when wealth abounds, the court is orderly—
for this is how one knows the source of all things.

But if one pursues the Great Dao with rigid, deliberate knowing,
they lose its origin,
and without the origin, its manifestations are not their own.
To take what is not theirs—
it is like sweeping one’s courtyard clean,
neglecting the fields,
emptying the granaries,
yet adorning oneself in fine silks,
girding sharp swords,
indulging in feasts,
and hoarding wealth—
this is not their own, yet they take it.
Without robbery and ostentation, how could it be?
How could this be the Dao?

**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation**
Those who build well do not uproot;
those who embrace well do not slip.
Their descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.

Cultivate within oneself, and virtue becomes true;
cultivate within the family, and virtue overflows;
cultivate within the village, and virtue endures;
cultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes;
cultivate within the world, and virtue is universal.
Thus, observe the self to understand the self,
observe the family to understand the family,
observe the village to understand the village,
observe the state to understand the state,
observe the world to understand the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

The Classic says:
All things that are built to stand
will inevitably be uprooted.
Only those who follow the Dao,
building with the constant and formless,
build well without contrivance.

All things that are grasped to hold fast
will inevitably slip away.
Only those who follow the Dao,
embracing *qi* with stillness,
grasp well without losing hold.

If what is built and embraced is thus,
then its transmission knows no end—
this is why descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.

What the world calls "cultivating virtue"
sometimes cultivates it in states and nations
without knowing its true origin lies within oneself—
thus it is said: *Cultivate within the self, and virtue becomes true.*
Or it is cultivated in the self
but cannot extend to states and nations—
thus it is said: *Cultivate within the family, and virtue overflows,*
*Cultivate within the village, and virtue endures,*
*Cultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes,*
*Cultivate within the world, and virtue is universal.*

Zhuangzi held that the true Dao governs the self,
its remnants benefit the state,
its remnants’ remnants govern the world—
his teaching stems from this.

Then how does one observe and cultivate the self?
By observing the self with the self alone.

What does it mean to observe the self with the self?
Now, when I observe what my self possesses—
I know the source from which my self has come.
Again, when I observe what allows me to observe—
I know the source from which my observing arises.
Having known the source of my self’s possession,
and the source of my observing,
then what is needed to cultivate the self is complete,
requiring no external aid.

To observe the family with the family,
the state with the state,
the world with the world—
it is the same in principle.

The ancients hid the world within the world
by this very Dao.

**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**
The depth of contained virtue
is like that of an infant.
Poisonous insects do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not attack,
grasping crows do not peck.
Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm;
they do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—
this is the peak of *qi*.
They wail all day yet their throat does not grow hoarse—
this is the peak of harmony.

To know harmony is to know constancy;
to know constancy is to know clarity;
to increase life is to bring auspiciousness;
to let the heart direct *qi* is to strengthen.

When things reach their peak, they decline—
this is called *not the Dao*.
Not the Dao brings early decay.

The Classic says:
When humans are first born,
their innate virtue is most profound.
As they grow, their ears and eyes turn outward,
their mind and perception turn inward,
and with each passing day, their excesses multiply—
thus their depth diminishes.

Those who follow the Dao reduce what brings excess,
refining nature to restore virtue,
until virtue returns to its original state—
hence it is said: *The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant.*

For the infant as a being,
it is merely that it receives the pure *qi* of the cosmos,
undispersed, yet poisonous insects do not sting,
ferocious beasts do not attack,
grasping crows do not peck.
How much more so for one who is fully pure and unguarded,
harmonized with all things in their creation,
whose harmony is vast and universal—
who could harm them?

This is what Wei Wenhou asked of Bo Shuang.

It is only the pure that can achieve harmony—
how do I know this?
Now, the infant grasps firmly without knowing what it grasps,
rises erect without knowing what it embraces—
this is purity.
If the infant had deliberate knowledge of grasping and embracing,
it would be coarse and inconsistent—
how could it remain thus?
Thus it is said: *Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm;
they do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—
this is the peak of qi.*

Without worry or anger,
even if they wail all day, their voice does not grow hoarse—
this is harmony.
If the infant had worries or anger,
their *qi* would become disordered and unharmonized—
how could they remain thus?
Thus it is said: *They wail all day yet their throat does not grow hoarse—
this is the peak of harmony.*

When form is complete and *qi* is restored,
one aligns with the cosmos.
Refining and refining again,
returning to align with Heaven.

When refinement reaches aligning with Heaven,
the pure *qi* of the cosmos becomes vast and universal—
how could it differ from all things?

Thus, the ultimate of governance
returns to restoring one’s original nature—
restoring one’s original nature is called constancy.
The depth of contained virtue
reaches knowing harmony—
knowing harmony is also called constancy.

Though virtue and the Dao may differ,
when they converge in constancy,
they are one.

To know constancy,
one follows it naturally without excess,
acting without knowing what to do,
moving without knowing where to go—
the body like a withered tree’s branch,
the heart like dead ashes—
how could the heart direct *qi* then?

Thus, excess leads to what is called *auspiciousness*.
Misfortune and fortune have no fixed form—
then there are no human calamities or *auspiciousness*.
Misfortune and fortune manifest here,
and human disasters follow in their wake.

When the heart directs *qi*, it is called *strength*.
Those who *strengthen* the *yang* are doomed.

To attain emptiness and uphold softness—
this is the Dao.
The Dao endures, lasting long,
and one’s life remains unperilled.

To attain fullness and *strength*—
then one is but an object among things.
When things flourish, they grow old—
this is their Dao.
Thus it is said:
*"When things flourish, they grow old—*
this is called *not-Dao*,
and *not-Dao* perishes early."

**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**
The wise do not *nurture* (the artificial),
those who speak do not know (the true).
Stop its *joyousness*,
close its gates,
dull its sharpness,
untangle its confusion,
soften its brilliance,
blend with the dust—
this is called *mysterious unity*.

It cannot be approached as near,
nor rejected as distant;
it cannot be seized as advantageous,
nor avoided as harmful;
it cannot be exalted as noble,
nor debased as lowly.
Thus it is most noble under Heaven.

The *Transmission* says:
*"To know constancy is the utmost of knowing.*
When knowing reaches its utmost,
one acts silently and achieves it,
and nothing remains ungoverned—
what need is there for the heart to intervene?

If one cannot refrain from speech,
one cannot refrain from self—
though one may know, it is not true knowing.
Thus it is said:
*The wise do not speak,
those who speak do not know.*

Stop its *joyousness*,
close its gates,
dull its sharpness,
untangle its confusion,
soften its brilliance,
blend with the dust—
this is the Dao of silent achievement.

If such is the case,
all things become a single repository,
life and death share the same form—
nothing is excessively close,
nothing is excessively distant.
Thus it cannot be approached as near,
nor rejected as distant.

It does not pursue advantage,
nor shun harm—
thus it cannot be seized as advantageous,
nor avoided as harmful.

It neither boasts of prominence,
nor wallows in obscurity—
thus it cannot be exalted as noble,
nor debased as lowly.

If one can be approached as near or distant,
advantaged or harmful,
noble or lowly—
then nobility lies in things,
and things can debase it.

If one cannot be approached as near or distant,
advantaged or harmful,
noble or lowly—
then nobility lies within oneself,
and things cannot debase it.

Thus its nobility under Heaven is most fitting.

Yet if one speaks of the Dao with speech,
then speech is not the Dao,
and those who know use speech as knowing—
this is knowing *knowing*.
Thus speech must emerge,
for though it emerges from non-speech,
even in speech, it remains unsaid.
How could the Dao be merely silent?

**Chapter 57: Governing with Rectitude**
Govern with rectitude,
employ the *unconventional* in warfare,
and take the world with non-action.
How do I know this is so?
Because of this.

**Chapter 58: The Politics of Obscurity**

When the world abounds in taboos,
the people grow ever poorer.
When men multiply clever devices,
the state grows ever more confused.
When men multiply arts and cunning,
strange things proliferate.
When laws and decrees proliferate,
thieves and robbers abound.

Thus the Sage says:
*"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.
I take no action, and the people grow rich.
I love stillness, and the people align themselves.
I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity."*

The Classic says:
*"The military does not enter the state,
the state does not enter the military—
this distinction has endured long,
and thus the methods of governing and waging war differ fundamentally."*

To govern a state,
one must not rely on fleeting or transient measures—
thus, one governs with rectitude, not with the unconventional.
Rectitude is what endures and persists.
Warfare is an inauspicious instrument,
not the tool of the virtuous—
thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.
If warfare persists and endures,
then one has indeed dwelled upon it—
thus, one employs the unconventional, not rectitude.
The unconventional is what responds to the exigencies of the moment.

Because of this, one cannot avoid using rectitude in governance,
and thus it is said:
*"Do not govern with cleverness—
this is the blessing of the state.*
To govern without relying on cleverness,
it is clear that one cannot take the world with action.
Thus it is said:
*'Govern with rectitude,
employ the unconventional in warfare,
and take the world with non-action.'*

How do I know that non-action suffices to take the world?
Because action does not suffice to take the world,
and thus I know it.

Only when one departs from non-action
and arrives at action,
does the world abound in taboos—
men avoid what they fear,
and thus the unemployed multiply while the people grow ever poorer.
Men multiply clever devices to pursue their desires,
and thus the lower orders become difficult to govern,
while the state grows ever more confused.
The people grow ever poorer and more cunning,
the state grows ever more confused and strange things proliferate—
this is why laws and decrees proliferate,
and thieves and robbers abound.

Laws are enforced where they are applied,
but cannot be enforced where they are not.
Decrees are obeyed where they are heard,
but cannot be obeyed where they are not.
When the people are poor and cunning,
there will be places where decrees are not obeyed.
When the state is confused and strange things proliferate,
there will be places where laws are not applied—
this is why they proliferate and thieves and robbers abound.

If this is so,
then all the faults of taking the world with action are evident.
Thus the Sage says:
*"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.
I love stillness, and the people align themselves.
I take no action, and the people grow rich.
I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity."*
This is the constant proof that the world is taken with non-action.

For if one acts without action,
the people transform themselves,
and if one loves stillness,
the people align themselves—
then the people will not multiply cunning,
strange things will not proliferate,
laws and decrees will not proliferate,
and thieves and robbers will not abound.
If one takes no action,
the people grow rich,
and if one desires nothing,
the people return to simplicity—
then the world will not abound in taboos,
and the people will not grow poorer,
nor will men multiply clever devices
and the state grow confused.

This is why,
when one departs from non-action,
the world abounds in taboos and the people grow poorer,
men multiply clever devices and the state grows confused.
Only thus do the people multiply cunning,
strange things proliferate,
laws and decrees proliferate,
and thieves and robbers abound.

To reverse this,
one must return to non-action and love stillness—
through non-action, the people transform themselves,
and abandon cunning, discard profit,
so that strange things do not arise.
Through loving stillness, the people align themselves,
and thieves and robbers disappear.
From non-action and loving stillness,
one arrives at non-action and no desire.
Through non-action, the people grow rich
and are free from the poverty of taboos.
Through no desire, the people return to simplicity
and are free from the confusion of clever devices.

Such is the order of things.

**Chapter 58: The Politics of Obscurity**
When governance is obscure,
the people are pure.
When governance is scrutinizing,
the people are artful.

Calamity, oh calamity—
it leans upon fortune.
Fortune, oh fortune—
it harbors calamity within.
Who knows their ultimate end?
Is there no rectitude at all?
Rectitude becomes the unconventional,
the good becomes the ominous.
The people’s confusion has endured long.

Thus the Sage is square without sharp edges,
sharp without severity,
straight without arrogance,
bright without dazzling.

The Classic says:
*"Govern with rectitude,
take the world with non-action—
then governance is obscure.
Obscure governance means one does not take scrutiny as pleasure,
and thus the people are pure.
Pure means they are not corrupted by superficiality.
To govern with cleverness,
to take the world with action—
then governance is scrutinizing.
Scrutinizing is the opposite of obscure,
and thus the people are artful.
Artful means they are not complete in simplicity.

Pure, they rest in virtue and nature,
and are not swayed by calamity, fortune, the unconventional, the good, or the ominous—
this is not being corrupted by superficiality.
Artful, they avoid calamity but are not necessarily free from it,
seek fortune but are not necessarily rewarded—
what they take as rectitude may sometimes be the unconventional,
what they take as good may sometimes be the ominous.
Calamity, fortune, the unconventional, the good, the ominous—
their ultimate end is unknown,
and cleverness only multiplies difficulties in governance—
this is not being complete in simplicity.

Why is this?
Time has beginnings and ends,
the world undergoes change—
calamity and fortune, obscure and pure,
sometimes clash, sometimes align.
What clashes is what the world calls calamity,
but what aligns is what fortune leans upon.
What aligns is what the world calls fortune,
but what clashes is what calamity harbors within.
Then who knows their ultimate end
and how to avoid or embrace them?
Men have followed their own faces,
some things are correct, some are erroneous—
thus what is called rectitude may not truly be known.

Now, what is taken as rectitude
may later become the unconventional,
and what is taken as the unconventional
may later become rectitude—
the good and the ominous are the same.
Thus the calamity, fortune, rectitude, unconventional, good, and ominous of the world
are ultimately indeterminable.

Since men first knew,
they have been confused and clung to these distinctions—
their error has endured long.
How can one add to it with scrutinizing governance
and prevent them from returning to simplicity and wholeness?"

Thus the Sage is square yet does not cut,
and so does not use one man’s measure to govern all under Heaven.
He is tranquil yet does not harm,
and so overcomes all things without injury.
He is upright yet not rigid,
and so can preserve the crooked and straighten the bent.
He is luminous yet not dazzling,
and so employs his light while returning to his clarity.

This is no other thing—
it is to take this *mèn-mèn* and discard that *cháchá*,
to abandon scrutiny and return to simplicity.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing Men and Serving Heaven**

To govern men and serve Heaven,
nothing surpasses *jǐn* (frugality).
For only *jǐn* is called *zǎo fù* (early restoration).
*Early restoration* is called *chóng jī dé* (profoundly accumulating virtue),
and profoundly accumulating virtue conquers all.
When all is conquered, none can fathom its limit—
when none can fathom its limit,
then one may possess a realm.
The mother of possessing a realm,
this is the Dao of deep roots, firm foundations,
and enduring life with lasting vision.

The Classic says:
To govern men without using what makes them *men* to govern them,
then men cannot truly be governed.
To serve Heaven without using what makes it *Heaven* to serve it,
then Heaven cannot truly be served.
When spirit pervades and flows in all directions without limit,
nurturing all things,
its name is *tóngdì* (the Sovereign of All),
for this is what makes men *men* and Heaven *Heaven*.
The pure, unadorned Dao—
only the divine preserves it.
Preserve it without loss,
and unite with the divine—
then how could men not be governed,
how could Heaven not be served?

Thus it is said:
To govern men and serve Heaven,
nothing surpasses *yīn* (music/sound).
For only *jǐn* preserves the spirit without exertion—
this is *early restoration*.
If one is not *jǐn* but dissipates it,
until spirit is exhausted and essence worn,
even if one wished to restore the spirit,
there would be no way to enter—
how could this not be late?
Thus it is said:
Only *yīn* is called *early restoration*.

Man’s life is inherently sufficient in virtue.
If truly able to practice *jǐn* and restore early,
then virtue grows daily—
thus it is called *early restoration* as *profoundly accumulating virtue*.
Profoundly accumulating virtue—
this is the utmost of virtue.
The utmost virtue:
fire cannot burn it,
water cannot drown it,
cold and heat cannot harm it,
and beasts cannot assail it—
then where could it not conquer?
Thus it is said:
Profoundly accumulating virtue conquers all.
If there is what it cannot conquer,
then its Dao has a limit.
If all is conquered,
who can know its limit?
Thus it is said:
When all is conquered, none can fathom its limit.

He who holds the land holds great things.
He who holds great things
does not use things to govern things,
and because he does not govern things,
he can govern all things.
None can fathom its limit—
this is to not govern yet govern all things.
Though he holds the land, he bears no burden—
thus it is said:
When none can fathom its limit,
one may possess a realm.
Having obtained its mother,
one knows its child.
Having known its child,
one returns to guard its mother.
Thus the body is unharmed—
hence it is said:
The mother of possessing a realm
can endure forever.

Thus the Dao of *yīn*
is called the Dao of deep roots, firm foundations,
and enduring life with lasting vision.
Spirit is the root of life—
preserve and store it,
and the root deepens while life grows.
Enduring life is the foundation of vision—
guard and protect it,
and the foundation is firm while vision endures.

*Volume Four of the Transmission of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic*

**Volume Four of the Transmission of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic**

**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great Realm**

To govern a great realm is like poaching a small fish.
To rule the world with the Dao,
its spirits are not numinous.
Not that its spirits are not numinous—
but because they are not numinous, they do not harm the people.
And because they do not harm the people,
the Sage does not harm the people.
Thus, when neither harms the other,
virtue and power return to each other.

The Classic says:
*"Having obtained the mother of possessing a realm to govern the realm,
even the greatest task is without difficulty."*

One does not overcook a fish when poaching,
and when poaching a small fish,
one must preserve it whole, not cutting it.
So too with governing a great realm—
if one cooks and cuts it, harm will come.
To rule the world with the Dao is called the Great Measure—
it is simply to refrain from cutting and harming.

When it reaches its utmost,
its spirits are not numinous—
this is simply the result of not harming.
How so?
The spirits, by the Dao,
are not without numinosity—
when they mingle and contend with humanity,
their numinosity appears,
and they cannot but harm people.
Yet why are they not numinous?
Because the Sage can rule the world with the Dao,
preventing people from indulging their nature,
from straying in their virtue,
from extreme joy or anger that disrupts the harmony of yin and yang—
those who dwell in the undifferentiated void,
in harmony with the age, attaining tranquility—
thus, the Sage does not harm people.
Only the Sage can refrain from harming people,
so yin and yang remain harmonious and still,
spirits and gods do not disturb,
all things are unharmed,
and life does not perish early—
thus, their numinosity does not harm people.
When their numinosity does not harm people,
there is no need for their manifestations to appear as numinous.
From this, it is seen:
Their spirits are not numinous,
not because their spirits are not numinous—
but because their numinosity does not harm people,
they are not numinous.
Not because their numinosity does not harm people—
but because the Sage does not harm people,
their numinosity does not harm people.
If the Sage, in relation to the people,
cannot preserve their primal purity and harms them,
and people lose their nature,
so that the seasons do not arrive,
the balance of cold and heat is not achieved,
and the ways in which people harm spirits multiply—
then how could the spirits not harm people?
Only when spirits do not harm people
do they return virtue to humanity,
and when spirits do not harm people,
people in turn return virtue to the spirits—
thus it is said:
*"When neither harms the other,
virtue and power return to each other."*

**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Realm as the Lowly Stream**

The great realm is the lowly stream of the world,
the world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive.
The receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,
and stillness is the lowly.
Thus, when the great realm yields to the small realm,
it takes the small realm;
when the small realm yields to the great realm,
it takes the great realm.
Thus, sometimes yielding to take,
sometimes yielding and taking.
The great realm seeks only to nurture people,
the small realm seeks only to serve the great.
Both obtain what they desire,
so the greater should yield.

The Classic says:
*"Knowing how to govern one’s realm with the Dao,
one certainly does not harm its people—
yet if one does not know how to exchange with the world,
then even if one does not harm people,
there will still be those who harm them."*

The great realm as the lowly stream,
the world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive—
the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,
and stillness is the lowly.
This is the way to exchange with the world
and preserve its people.
Indeed, the world’s exchange is the receptive,
and the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—
and the reason it overcomes is because it yields through stillness.

If the great realm truly dwells in the lowly stream
to achieve the world’s exchange,
then the receptive’s stillness as the lowly
is the way to overcome the active—
thus, when the great yields to the small,
it takes the small—
this is what is meant by *"yielding to take."*
Yielding to take means:
Though the great, in relation to the small,
seems as if it could avoid yielding,
it yields to take in winter.
When the small yields to the great,
it takes the great—
this is what is meant by *"yielding and taking."*
Yielding and taking means:
Though the small, in relation to the great,
cannot but yield to take.
Indeed, the great seeks only to nurture people,
while the small seeks only to serve the great.
Now, the great yields to the small,
and the small yields to the great—
both obtain what they desire,
so who would not take?
Taking means:
To win their hearts and not lose them.

Then why does it say only the great should yield?
Because if the small cannot yield to the great,
it not only fails to take the great realm
but also invites calamity upon itself—
thus, it is not merely inappropriate,
hence it is said: *"The great should yield."*

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Innermost Essence of All Things**

The Dao is the innermost essence of all things,
the treasure of the virtuous,
the refuge of the unvirtuous.
Beautiful words can be sold,
noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
What is there to abandon in humanity’s unvirtue?
Thus, when establishing the Son of Heaven
and appointing the Three Ministers,
even if one offers a jade tablet before four horses,
it is not as good as presenting this Dao.

The ancients valued this Dao so highly—
why not seek it daily to obtain it,
and use it to avert guilt?
Thus, it is the most precious for the world.

The Classic says:
*"All things bear yin within and embrace yang without,
and through the interplay of the void and qi achieve harmony—
thus, there is not a single thing that is not complete within the Dao."*

A house has its innermost chamber,
deep and secluded, where the honored dwell.
All things have their deep, secluded, and honored places—
this is the Dao.
Thus it is said:
*"The Dao is the innermost essence of all things."*
Because of this,
it is the treasure of the virtuous
and the refuge of the unvirtuous.
How so?
The virtuous know where their virtue originates,
and thus, obtaining it, they possess boundless, inexhaustible wealth—
is this not their treasure?
The unvirtuous, knowing their unvirtue,
when they reach this point of profound unity,
even with ten thousand evils,
they dissolve and release—
is this not their refuge?

The beauty of speech can be traded,
the nobility of action can be bestowed upon others—
yet all people, whether good or evil,
know what is truly beautiful and what is truly noble.

Those who embody the Dao toward others,
are like Heaven and Earth:
Heaven covers all without exception,
Earth bears all without exception—
far surpassing the comparison of beautiful speech and noble actions.
Thus, how could there be any evil in people that should be discarded?

Therefore, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,
even if one offers a jade tablet before swift horses
to honor the sovereign,
it is only the reverence of ritual and the weight of the gift.
Yet this cannot compare to sitting and presenting this Dao—
for the Dao is the most precious treasure for all under Heaven.
Even if presented while seated,
it surpasses the reverence of ritual and the weight of gifts.

The Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers
gather to discuss nothing but this.

Why did the ancients hold this Dao in such high regard?
Was it merely to seek and obtain,
or to have crimes pardoned?

To hold it as the most precious for all under Heaven,
to seek and obtain it—
this is the treasure of the virtuous.
To have crimes pardoned through it—
this is the refuge of the unvirtuous.
Because of this,
it is the most precious for all under Heaven,
and thus the ancients could not help but honor it.

**Chapter 63: On Non-Action**
To act without acting,
to manage without managing,
to savor without savoring—
great or small, much or little,
to repay resentment with virtue.

To plan for difficulty in its ease,
to achieve greatness in its triviality.
The most difficult tasks under Heaven
must begin with what is easy;
the greatest undertakings under Heaven
must begin with what is small.
Thus, the Sage never strives for greatness,
and so achieves true greatness.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many trivialities bring many difficulties.
Therefore, the Sage anticipates difficulty,
and so never faces it.

The Classic says:
Those who embody the Dao
act by doing nothing,
and so practice non-action.
To act without acting,
to manage without managing,
to savor without savoring—
how so?
When we are in the midst of doing,
we seek the doer and find none—
this is to act by doing nothing.
If there is action, there is managing;
to act without acting means managing without managing.
Not only is there no managing,
but even savoring it yields no taste.
To savor is to repeatedly examine and ponder it.
The Dao, as a thing,
cannot be seen when looked at,
cannot be heard when listened to,
cannot be grasped when seized—
even when repeatedly examined and pondered,
it returns to nothingness.
Because of this,
it can be great, can be small,
can be much, can be little.
Much and little depend on oneself,
and those called "resentful" have no fixed hearts—
thus, even the unvirtuous I treat with virtue,
and virtue repays virtue.
The untrustworthy I treat with trust,
and trust repays trust,
and all are repaid with virtue.

What people find hardest to forget is resentment,
yet to repay it with virtue,
nothing burdens the heart.
This is not mere talk—
to plan for difficulty in its ease,
to achieve greatness in its triviality,
to ensure that all difficult tasks under Heaven
begin with what is easy,
and all great undertakings under Heaven
begin with what is small—
while I myself remain ever non-acting.
If there is any action,
it must be seen in what is easy and small,
and this is what is meant by "knowing the subtle omens."
If one attains this in the heart,
then extending it to all under Heaven and the state
is without difficulty.

Thus, the Sage never strives for greatness,
and so achieves true greatness—
for greatness lies in what is small,
not in what is already great.

A promise is easy to make,
but difficult to fulfill.
If one is not cautious at the moment of promising,
fulfillment becomes difficult.
What is easy to plan when easy becomes difficult when difficult—
if one does not plan at the beginning when it is easy,
but waits until it is difficult,
then it becomes difficult—
this is why common people are few in trust and often face difficulties.

Therefore, the Sage anticipates difficulty,
and so never faces it—
by anticipating difficulty when it is easy,
and not waiting until it is difficult.

**Chapter 64: On Ease and Simplicity**
What is stable is easy to hold,
what is not yet manifest is easy to plan,
what is fragile is easy to break,
what is subtle is easy to disperse.
Act before it exists,
govern before it is disordered.

A tree thick enough to embrace
grows from a sprout;
a nine-tiered tower
begins with a clod of earth;
a thousand-li journey
starts beneath one’s feet.

To act when it already exists
leads to ruin;
to grasp when it is already formed
leads to loss.
Thus, the Sage acts without acting and so knows no ruin,
holds without grasping and so knows no loss.

The people’s undertakings
often fail when nearly complete.
To be as careful at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no failed endeavors.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
does not prize what is difficult to obtain;
learns what others have not learned,
corrects what others have erred in,
and aids the natural unfolding of all things
without daring to act.

The Classic says:
What is stable is easy to hold—
if it is already precarious and then held,
it becomes difficult.
What is not yet manifest is easy to plan—
if it is already in motion and then planned,
it becomes difficult.
What is fragile is easy to break—
do not let it reach solidity.
What is subtle is easy to disperse—
do not let it take form.
All things are thus,
but the heart is the most so.
Extending this to the heart,
there is no difficulty in all under Heaven and the state.

Stability, not yet manifest—
this is to act before it exists.
Fragility, subtlety—
this is to govern before it is disordered.
A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout—
it grows from small beginnings.
A nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth—
height arises from the low.
A thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet—
distance begins with nearness.
Thus, to act before it exists,
to govern before it is disordered—
the beginning and end are always thus.

To act before it exists
is to achieve by doing nothing.
To govern before it is disordered
is to order by not ordering.
If it already exists and then acted upon,
action seeks completion but instead brings ruin.
If it is already disordered and then governed,
grasping seeks stability but instead brings loss.

Thus, the Sage acts before it exists,
yet remains in non-action—
so there is no ruin.
He governs before it is disordered,
yet holds no grasp—
so there is no loss.

The people act only after things already exist,
so they reach near-completion only to fail—
for they do not know its origin.

If they knew that greatness arises from smallness,
height from lowliness,
distance from nearness,
and treated the end with the care of the beginning,
then there would be no failed undertakings.

Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,
values not the hard-to-obtain treasures,
so that his desires may glide beyond the common,
and his thoughts may seek to attain clarity—
yet this is not what is truly known.

He learns without learning,
correcting the errors of the multitude,
assisting the natural unfolding of all things,
yet daring not to act—
thus refining his nature amidst the common,
while the common learn to return to their origins—
yet this too is not what is truly known.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Masters of the Dao**

The ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to make them simple.
For the people are difficult to govern because they are too clever.

Thus, to govern a state with cleverness is to ruin it;
to govern without cleverness is to bless it.
To know these two principles is to grasp the standard.

To always know the standard is called *Xuan Virtue*.
*Xuan Virtue* is profound and distant,
contrary to things—
and only then does it reach the greatest harmony.

The saying goes:
*"While others are bright and clear,
I alone seem dim;
While others are sharp and discerning,
I alone am muddled—
this is the heart of the simple."*

The ancient masters of the Dao,
if such was their nature within themselves,
then when applied to the people,
was not to enlighten them,
but to make them simple.

Bright and clear—this is called enlightenment.
Dim and muddled—this is called simplicity.

The people lose their nature,
dwelling in ornament while abandoning substance,
so their cleverness multiplies and they become hard to govern.

If one truly wishes to govern them,
then remove their cleverness and their artifices,
and steady them with the nameless simplicity—
then they will transform of their own accord.
But if one governs them with cleverness,
it is only to further confuse them.

If one does not recognize, does not know,
and follows the natural patterns,
then to harm those patterns is to be a thief.
To govern a state with cleverness
is to harm its natural patterns—
thus it is said: *"To govern a state with cleverness is to ruin it."*

To govern a state without cleverness
is to have no obtrusive knowledge,
its way is smooth and unforced,
and there is no blessing of life—
yet it has the mother of the state,
which can endure forever.
Thus, to govern a state without cleverness is to bless it.

To know these two principles
is not only the standard for governing a state,
but also for oneself—
never straying from it.

If one knows the child but guards the mother,
then the body remains unharmed—
this is to govern without cleverness, and it brings blessing.

If one opens the *Jue* (receptivity) and aids its affairs,
yet the end is never reached—
this is to govern with cleverness, and it brings ruin.

Thus, whether to govern with or without cleverness—
is this not also my standard?

If one truly knows the standard and does not stray from virtue,
then it may be called *Xuan*.
When virtue reaches *Xuan*,
it is deep and unfathomable,
distant and immeasurable—
observed through emotion, it cannot be grasped by the heart,
yet when it arrives,
it returns to the root of things,
and nothing opposes it.
Thus it is said:
*"To always know the standard is to possess Xuan Virtue."*

*Xuan Virtue* is profound and distant,
contrary to things—
and only then does it reach the greatest harmony.

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The River and Sea as King of the Valleys**

The river and sea become king of the valleys
because they excel in yielding.
Thus, the Sage who wishes to be above others
speaks in a way that is below them;
who wishes to lead others
places himself behind them.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The Way of Non-Contention**

Thus, though one is placed above others, they are not resented;
though one is placed before others, they are not harmed.
Therefore, the world willingly promotes them without exhaustion.
Because they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them.

The *Transmission* says:
*"The river and sea become king of the valleys because they excel in yielding—
thus, he who can be king over the world also excels in yielding.
Therefore, *Xuan Virtue* is the Way by which one yields to those below."*

Zhuangzi said:
*"If one dwells below through this Way,
then it is the Way of the *Xuan Sage* and the *Unadorned King*—
and when Shun was below, he said, 'My *Xuan Virtue* ascends in renown.'
Thus, *Xuan Virtue* is indeed the Way by which the Sage dwells below.
To dwell below through this Way while occupying a position above others—
this is how one yields to them."*

The Sage, though ruling the world,
in terms of his station, certainly desires to be above others—
yet he calls himself *"the lonely, the orphaned, the destitute"* and accepts the filth and misfortune of the state,
for he speaks in a way that is below them.
In terms of his order, he certainly desires to lead others—
yet he is pressed before he moves, responds only when moved,
and acts only when compelled—
for he places himself behind them.

If one speaks in a way that is below others,
then though placed above, they do not resent him—
and if they do not resent him, they will bear him lightly.
If one places himself behind others,
then though placed before them, they do not harm him—
and if they do not harm him, they will follow him as beneficial.

Not resented, not harmed—
this is why the world willingly promotes him without exhaustion.
He who speaks in a way that is below others
and places himself behind others—
this is the one who does not contend.
When the world willingly promotes him without exhaustion,
none under heaven can contend with him.
Unless one embodies *Xuan Virtue*,
how could it be so?

Thus it is said:
*"Only because he does not contend,
none under heaven can contend with him."*

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The World’s Misunderstanding**

The world all say my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy.
Only because it is great does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.

I have three treasures; I hold and preserve them:
First, *compassion*;
Second, *frugality*;
Third, *not daring to act first under heaven.*

*Compassion*, thus one can be courageous;
*Frugality*, thus one can be expansive;
*Not daring to act first under heaven*, thus one can become a vessel and leader.

Now, if one abandons *compassion* and courage,
abandons *frugality* and expansiveness,
abandons *following* and acts first—
then death is deserved.

*Compassion*, in war brings victory;
in defense, it makes firm.
Heaven, when it would save, guards with *compassion*.

The *Transmission* says:
*"The world sees only my Dao’s greatness
and says it seems unworthy,
yet they do not know
why it is great—
it is because it seems unworthy.
How so?
The Great Dao is vast and unrestricted,
left and right, nowhere it is not present.
They see it is nowhere not present,
yet nothing to compare to—
they call it unworthy,
yet they do not know
that because it is nowhere not present,
it seems unworthy—
this is how the Dao’s greatness manifests.
Truly, all things are not apart from the Dao—
then the Dao has nothing outside it.
If the Dao has nothing outside it,
then there is nothing to which it resembles—
this is why it is great.
If there were something to which it resembled,
then the Dao would have something outside it.
If the Dao has something outside it,
then the Dao is not everywhere present—
how could it still be great?
Thus it is said:
*The world all say my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy.
Only because it is great does it seem unworthy.
If it were worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.*

Truly, my Dao is so great
because I have no self and do not contend.
Only because I have no self and do not contend
can I hold what others find difficult to hold.
I have three treasures; I hold and preserve them:
First, *compassion*;
Second, *frugality*;
Third, *not daring to act first under heaven.*
These are all what others find difficult to hold.
How so?
People cannot have no self and not contend,
so though courageous, they cannot be compassionate;
though expansive, they cannot be frugal;
though they act first, they cannot follow—
only by having no self and not contending
can one preserve these three treasures and hold them.

Under heaven, there is a beginning—
called the Mother of the world—
and I guard it,
always broad and accommodating toward things,
never diminishing others.
Is this not *compassion*?
In conducting oneself,
slow and unexhausted,
taking *moderation* as principle—
is this not *frugality*?
Never acting first, always following others—
while others all take the lead,
one alone takes the rear—
is this not *not daring to act first under heaven*?

*Compassion* is soft and weak,
yet it overcomes the strong and rigid—
this is courage.
*Frugality* is not wasteful,
yet its use is inexhaustible—
this is expansiveness.
*Not daring to act first under heaven* is to be last,
yet the Sage uses this to become an official and leader—
all follow me—
this is to become a vessel and leader.

Now, if one abandons *compassion* and courage,
abandons *frugality* and expansiveness,
abandons *following* and acts first—
then they are merely the rigid and strong,
and death is indeed deserved.

From the perspective of affairs,
military campaigns love to display their might,
and if their victories are complete and without flaw,
then *compassion* seems to have no place.
Yet from the perspective of the root,
what establishes their might is *compassion* alone.
Thus it is said:
*"Compassion*, in war brings victory;
in defense, it makes firm."

*Compassion* is the origin of the three treasures—
frugality and not daring to act first under heaven.
If one abandons *compassion*, death follows;
if one preserves *compassion*, life follows—
thus *compassion* is what guards my life.
Therefore it is said:
*"Heaven, when it would save, guards with compassion."*
When *compassion* is established, the three treasures arise.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Virtue of the Gentle Scholar**

The virtuous scholar does not rely on force;
the virtuous warrior does not grow angry;
the one who best defeats enemies does not contend;
the one who best uses people places himself below them.

This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
this is called the *power of using people*,
this is called the *harmony of ancient times with Heaven*.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Doctrine of the Gentle Scholar (Continued)**

The Classics say: *"The term 'scholar' (士) refers to one who serves the Dao and takes upon himself the responsibility of guiding others."* To serve the Dao is to triumph through non-contention; to guide others is to employ the *power of using people*. If this is so, then what need is there for force? Hence it is said: *"The virtuous scholar does not rely on force."* For a scholar who has no need of force, then the one skilled in battle does not grow angry, the one who best defeats enemies does not contend, and the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is only proper.

Why is this? Those who embody the Dao do not contend; when they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them. Thus, the virtuous scholar does not rely on force, the skilled warrior does not grow angry, and the one who best defeats enemies does not contend—this is called the *virtue of non-contention*. Those who embody the Dao can place themselves below others; those who place themselves below others take joy in being used and do not seek self-use. Thus, the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is called the *power of using people*.

In *virtue*, there is no contention; in *power*, one employs others. Even in the dangers of warfare, I remain without action—how much more so in all else? To act without acting is the *virtue of Heaven*; when one reaches the state of non-action, one aligns with Heaven and cannot be surpassed. Hence it is said: *"This is called the harmony of ancient times with Heaven."*

**Chapter Seventy: The Art of Warfare**

The art of warfare has this saying: *"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."* This is called *moving without moving*, *pushing without arms*, *conquering without opposition*, *holding without weapons*. No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures. Hence, when armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail.

The Classics say: *"The Dao’s movement always arises from being pressed yet triumphing through non-contention. When applied to warfare, it should seem as though there is no action."* Yet those who wage war say: *"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."* Thus, even in war, one moves only when pressed, yet triumphs through non-contention—how much more so in all else?

Why is this? The aggressor is reversed, the defender prevails; the aggressor labors, the defender rests; advancing is arrogant, retreating is humble; advancing is hasty, retreating is composed. To meet reversal with compliance, to meet labor with rest, to meet arrogance with humility, to meet haste with composure—these are not to be opposed. This is so because the Dao’s constant principle arises from non-action; thus its movement always arises from being pressed, and its victory always comes through non-contention—even in warfare, it is no different.

If one truly knows that action arises from non-action, then my conduct is always without conduct, my pushing is always without arms, my opposition is always without resistance, my grasp is always without weapons—where then can I not triumph? If one cannot act from non-action, knowing only the aggressor but not the defender, knowing only advance but not retreat, this is called underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy risks losing what I hold dear—my treasures. Hence it is said: *"No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures."* Only those who triumph through non-contention cannot be defeated; hence it is said: *"When armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail."*

**Chapter Seventy: The Dao’s Simplicity**

My words are very easy to know, very easy to act upon.
Yet none under heaven can know them, none can act upon them.
Words have a root; affairs have a lord.
It is only because of ignorance that they do not know me.
Few know me, and thus I am held in high regard.
Therefore the Sage appears in humble garb while treasuring virtue.

The Classics say: *"The Dao follows natural law; its words are rare yet natural."* Naturalness means non-action; thus to know and act upon it is not difficult. Yet none under heaven can know or act—why is this? Because words have a root, and affairs have a lord, yet none under heaven knows their root or lord, and thus they do not know me.

What is the root? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the root of words. From this root, though words may differ, they are but branches and descendants—how can there be those who do not know? What is the lord? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the lord of affairs. To grasp the lord and govern it, though affairs may differ, they are but servants—how can there be those who cannot act?

It is only because they do not know the root and the lord that they do not know me. The Dao’s reason for being held in high regard by all under heaven is that it cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognition—thus it is held in high regard. If the Dao could be known by knowing and recognized by recognition, what would be its worth? Hence it is said: *"Few know me, and thus I am held in high regard."* Therefore the Sage appears with the guise of humiliation and folly, yet within holds great virtue and splendor—this is called *"wearing coarse cloth while treasuring jade."*

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**

Knowing the unknown—this is the highest.

**Chapter Seventy-One (continued): Knowing the Unknown**

Not knowing the known—this is illness.
Only by being ill of illness does one not fall ill.
The Sage does not fall ill because he is ill of illness, and thus does not fall ill.
The Classic says: *"The Dao in its essence is that which is unknown yet knows."*

To know one’s own ignorance and yet act as if knowing—this is the pinnacle of knowing.
Thus it is said: *Not knowing the known is illness.*

Even if one knows one’s ignorance yet acts as if knowing, will not one’s mind be mediocre and at ease?
Thus it is said: *Not knowing the known is illness.*

Only by being ill of the illness of knowing does one turn back to non-knowing, and then knowing is no longer sufficient to make one ill.
Thus it is said: *Only by being ill of illness does one not fall ill.*

The Sage does not fall ill—this is all.
Thus it is said: *Because he is ill of illness, he does not fall ill.*

Southward Child Qi said:
*"I pity those who lose themselves.
I also pity those who pity those who lose themselves.
I also pity those who pity those who pity those who lose themselves—
and so it recedes day by day.
If one such as Child Tai, can he be called one who is ill of illness?"*

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**

The people do not fear authority—then great authority arrives.
Do not constrain their dwelling, do not exhaust their livelihood.
Only because one does not exhaust it, is it not exhausted.
Thus the Sage knows himself yet does not reveal himself,
loves himself yet does not exalt himself—
and so he discards that to take this.

The Classic says:
*"The people are not blind to the Dao,
yet they only esteem knowledge and recognition,
and thus life flourishes thickly.
Life flourishes thickly,
so death is held lightly.
Death is held lightly,
so authority is not feared.
When the people reach the point of not fearing authority,
they will do whatever they please—
this is how Heaven itself makes its authority manifest
and greatly unleashes its punishments.
Thus it is said: The people do not fear authority—then great authority arrives."*

Only those who govern by the Dao know
that it fills Heaven and Earth, embraces the six extremes,
and all that is granted by Heaven shares this same dwelling—
do not constrain it, that is all.
Qi and spirit flow freely in all directions, reaching everywhere—
all that is granted by Heaven shares this same life—
do not exhaust it, that is all.

The people are not constant; it depends on me alone.
Only because I do not exhaust it, the people also do not exhaust it—
then why should they not fear authority?

Thus the Sage knows himself with constancy
yet does not reveal himself through external display,
knows constancy yet transcends his own body—
this is how he does not constrain their dwelling.
He loves himself with moderation
yet does not exalt himself to forfeit his life—
loving sound yet forfeiting his life—
this is how he does not exhaust their livelihood.

Thus he discards the illness of knowledge
and takes this non-recognition, non-knowing non-illness.

---

**Chapter Seventy-Three: Courage in Not-Daring**

Courage in daring leads to death;
courage in not-daring leads to life.
Knowing these two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful.
What Heaven abhors—who can know its reason?

Thus the Sage finds it difficult.
The Way of Heaven does not contend yet wins well,
does not speak yet responds well,
does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
open yet plans well.

The net of Heaven is vast, sparse yet nothing is lost.
The Classic says:
*"Those who are rigid and clash with external things—
these are the daring, and they are doomed to death.
Thus it is said: Courage in daring leads to death.
Those who are yielding and have no fixed course—
these are the not-daring, and they are doomed to life.
Thus it is said: Courage in not-daring leads to life.*

Courage in daring is seen as beneficial by people,
yet harm may lie within it.
Courage in not-daring is seen as harmful by people,
yet benefit may lie within it.
Thus Heaven’s abhorrence—
perhaps it cannot be known by knowing and recognized by recognition.
Thus it is said: These two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—
Heaven’s abhorrence, who knows its reason?

Thus when the Sage acts,
he proceeds cautiously as if crossing a river in winter,
he fears his neighbors as if they were enemies—
he finds it difficult to this extent,
because Heaven’s abhorrence is unknowable.
Only because it is unknowable,
does non-recognition and non-knowing
become the way to follow Heaven’s pattern.

Heaven in creating things
nurtures them according to their nature—
supporting the upright, overturning the tilted—
yet it never contends with things,
and yet nothing can defy it.
Thus it is said: *It does not contend yet wins well.*

What does Heaven speak of?
The four seasons proceed in it,
a hundred creatures live in it—
their proceeding, their living,
never deviates.
Thus it is said: *It does not speak yet responds well.*

That which no one does yet is done—this is Heaven.
That which no one summons yet arrives—this is Fate.
Thus it is said: *It does not summon yet comes of its own accord.*

The easy is easy to know,
yet its Way of fullness and emptiness
rises and falls with the times—
never deviating.
Thus it is said: *Open yet plans well.*

Heaven’s wisdom and clarity come from the people’s wisdom and clarity,
Heaven’s manifest authority comes from the people’s manifest authority—
yet its wisdom and authority are never self-applied,
and blessings and calamities follow like echoes—
thus it is said: *The net of Heaven is vast, sparse yet nothing is lost.*

Only because Heaven’s Way is thus unknowable,
does the Sage dare in not-daring,
not recognizing, not knowing—
and thus knows how to follow it.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Normally Fear Death**

The people do not normally fear death—
why use death to frighten them?
If one were to make people always fear death
and act strangely because of it,
I could seize and kill them—who would dare?

There are always those who execute killings,
and those who replace them in killing—
this is like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.
A substitute carpenter wielding the axe—
few escape uninjured.

The Classic says:
*"The people’s Way is naturally one of not fearing death.
Only by not constraining their dwelling,
not exhausting their livelihood,
can one make them fear authority and hold death in reverence—
why use death to frighten them and wish them to fear death?
How do I know this is so?"*

If one forces the people to always fear death and act recklessly,
then I could seize and kill them—who would dare not fear death and act recklessly?

Yet if one seizes them but cannot overpower them,
and kills them but the killings do not cease,
then it is clear that the people do not fear death
and cannot be made to fear it through death.

Then, if one governs the world through the Dao,
how should one proceed?

Let there always be those who execute killings,
and do not substitute for them—that is all.

What does "let there always be those who execute killings" mean?
The Heavenly Net is vast and all-encompassing,
yet its mesh is wide and it does not lose a single thread.
Heaven punishes the guilty with the Five Punishments and Five Uses—
these are the ones who execute killings, spoken of as Heaven itself.

If punishments and executions arise from personal likes and dislikes
rather than being applied according to Heaven’s retribution,
then this is substituting for those who execute killings.

To substitute for those who execute killings
is like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.
A substitute carpenter wielding the axe—
few escape uninjured.
Thus, the harm of substituting for those who execute killings is evident.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: The People’s Hunger**

The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes.
Thus, they hunger.
The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively.
Thus, they are difficult to govern.
People grow careless about death because their sustenance is abundant.
Thus, they grow careless about death.
Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.

The Classic says:
*"If one man’s labor is enough to feed several households,
why should there be hunger at all?
Yet hunger arises—is it not because their rulers take too much in taxes?
They weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—
this is called harmony of virtue (*tóngdé*).
Why should they be difficult to govern?
Yet they become difficult to govern—is it not because their rulers act excessively?
If their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their customs settled,
and their dwellings pleasant,
why should they grow careless about death?
Yet they grow careless about death—is it not because their sustenance is abundant,
and thus they grow careless about death?"*

Therefore, the Sage does nothing and the people grow rich,
desires nothing and the people return to simplicity.
Thus, there is no hunger from excessive taxation.
With no action, the people transform themselves;
with a love of stillness, the people align themselves.
Thus, there is no difficulty in governance from excessive action.
Self-enrichment, self-simplicity, self-transformation, self-alignment—
when these exist, there is no hunger or difficulty in governance,
and thus no carelessness about death from abundant sustenance.

It is because of their grasping for knowledge, their scheming for gain,
and their insatiable striving that people reach such abundance
and grow careless about death.
If one does not cling to life,
it is clear that this is wiser than prizing life.

Thus, the Sage does not flaunt himself nor does he burden himself with responsibility,
knowing only that one must not cling to life.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: On Human Life**

Human life is soft and weak,
but death is hard and strong.
Grass and trees are soft and brittle when alive,
but dry and withered when dead.
Thus, the hard and strong belong to death,
while the soft and weak belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies do not conquer,
and rigid trees are easily felled.
The hard and strong dwell below,
while the soft and weak dwell above.

The Classic says:
*"The Dao, as a thing, is formless yet does not contend—
Heaven’s ultimate softness and weakness,
yet no one comprehends it.
Thus, I use things with form to illustrate it.*

Human life is soft and weak,
but death is hard and strong.
Grass and trees are soft and brittle when alive,
but dry and withered when dead—
even things with form die hard and strong,
and live soft and weak.
How much more so the Dao, which is formless,
if it does not maintain its softness and weakness?
Is this possible?

Thus, strong armies rely on their strength and grow arrogant,
becoming the target of enemy schemes.
If I am arrogant and the enemy schemes,
then this is why I do not conquer.
Rigid trees are felled—
this is why they are easily uprooted and carried away.
It is not without reason.

Yet speaking in terms of position:
Heaven’s *qi* dwells above, while Earth’s form dwells below.
*Qi* is soft and weak, while form is hard and strong.
The minister acts through deeds for the ruler,
while the ruler governs through non-action to nurture the people.
Action is hard and strong, while non-action is soft and weak.
The hard and strong dwell below, the soft and weak dwell above—
this is the natural order of things.
Thus, it is clear that the soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,
But the Dao of humanity does otherwise—
It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.
Who then can use their excess to nourish the world?
Only the one in accord with the Dao.

Thus, the Sage acts but does not rely upon it,
Completes the deed but does not dwell upon it—
Why does he not wish to be seen as virtuous?
The Classic says: *The Dao of Heaven is simply non-action.*
Non-action means no partiality,
No partiality means balance—
Just as with drawing a bow:
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented,
And all is brought to balance.

Now, the Dao of Heaven does not deliberately lower the high or raise the low;
It simply follows non-action, letting things take their natural course.
Thus, the high become excessive and must be diminished,
The low become deficient and must be supplemented.
Fullness invites diminishment, humility invites increase—
This is the working of Heaven’s Dao.

Humanity cannot practice non-action,
Cannot practice non-action, then cannot avoid partiality,
Cannot avoid partiality, then it comes to diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—
Which is no different.

Only the one in accord with the Dao
Knows that before anything arises, all deeds and names are my own excess,
While the world’s deficiencies struggle and contend.
Thus, he diminishes his excess to nourish the world without claiming it,
And it is said: *Only the one in accord with the Dao can diminish his excess to nourish the world.*
The Sage is the one in accord with the Dao,
And so he acts but does not rely upon it,
Completes the deed but does not dwell upon it—
Not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous,
But simply because he follows the Dao of Heaven.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak of the World**

Nothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,
Yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.
Heaven uses this to transform it.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong—
All know this, yet none can practice it.

Therefore, the Sage says:
*"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;
To bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world."*
This is *straight speech as if reversed.*

The Classic says:
*"Of all things in the world, only water can
Follow the contours of the crooked and straight, the round and square—
Thus, nothing is as soft and weak as water.
Yet it flows past great objects,
Turns great stones,
Pierces hills and valleys,
Floats and bears the weight of Heaven and Earth—
Only water can do this,
Thus, nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.
This is so because, though it bends and twists in myriad ways,
It never loses its essence as water—
And so there is nothing that can alter it."*

Though water is soft and weak,
And though all know that the soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong,
Laozi repeatedly emphasizes this—why?
Because though all know it, none can practice it.

The clever and insightful may presume to govern,
Yet their flaw lies not in lacking strength,
But in their inability to diminish their excess to nourish the world,
To hold fast to the soft and weak,
And to avoid being burdened by names, titles, wisdom, and the schemes of ministers and officials.
Thus, when Laozi concludes his discourse on *Dao* and *virtue*,
He repeatedly returns to this teaching,
And cites the Sage’s words to affirm it:
*"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;
To bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world."*
This makes clear that the way to serve the world lies here, not there.

Now, the kings of the Three Dynasties first sought fame,
Yet they said: *"To bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes—
This is to be the master of the state and soil, the king of the world."*
Why?
Because those who seek fame before its time
Are neither excessive in their words nor deficient—
To bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes
Is to exceed the bounds of fame,
For fame cannot encompass it.
Deficient speech responds to circumstances,
Circumstantial speech varies with events.
Excessive speech embodies the Dao,
Dao-embodying speech is true.
Thus, *straight speech as if reversed*—
The words of Tang and Wu say:
*"All under Heaven has guilt, resting upon me alone."*
This is the one who knows how to bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**

To harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—
How then can this be called good?
Thus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others.
Therefore, the virtuous oversee the contract,
The unvirtuous oversee the execution.
Heaven’s Dao has no favorites—
It always sides with the good.

The Classic says:
*"One who seeks vengeance does not break the ancestral tablet,
Though harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles."*
Thus, the world is balanced.

Without this Dao, grievances arise,
And though people seek to harmonize them, the entanglements cannot be undone—
Hence, *to harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.*
The unvirtuous, I also treat with virtue—
This is how virtue is cultivated.
Yet to harmonize great grievances while still leaving lingering ones—
How can this be called good?

Thus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others—
This ensures that those seeking vengeance do not break the ancestral tablet,
Though harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles,
And the world is balanced in this way.

In ancient times, when presenting chariots and horses,
The right contract was held—
The right contract was for taking,
The left contract was for giving—
Thus, the left contract was always given to others and never kept.
The Sage acts but does not rely upon it,
Completes the deed but does not dwell upon it,
Always using his excess to nourish the world,
Yet when it comes to killing, he lets the proper officials execute it
And never takes the blame himself—
This is holding the left contract to give to others
Without claiming ownership,
And so there is no grievance and no demand for repayment.

Is this because he takes pleasure in harmonizing?
Thus, the virtuous oversee the contract—
They simply do not demand repayment from others.

Without virtue to oversee the contracts, those who merely facilitate transactions are its agents.

The Dao/Way has no favorites—
It always aligns with the virtuous.
Without favoritism, it bestows upon the virtuous alone—
This too is holding the left contract without demanding repayment from others.

**Chapter Eighty of *Small States, Few People***

In small states with few people,
Let there be tenfold or hundredfold implements yet unused,
Let the people hold life dear and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
They shall have no use for them;
Though there be armor and weapons,
They shall have no place to deploy them.
Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let their food be simple, their garments plain,
Their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Neighboring states, though visible, hear only the sounds of roosters and dogs,
And the people live out their days to old age without crossing borders.

The *Classic* says:
From the Three Dynasties onward until the decline of Zhou,
Its culture grew ever more decadent,
And the people lost their natural way of life.
Thus Laozi’s words restore simplicity#1,
To return to the governance of primordial antiquity.

In small states with few people,
Let there be tenfold or hundredfold implements yet unused,
Let the people hold life dear and not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
They shall have no use for them;
Though there be armor and weapons,
They shall have no place to deploy them.

This is the restoration of simplicity to return to the Dao of primordial antiquity.

Zhuang Zhou spoke of the age of supreme virtue, saying:

In the time of Rongcheng Shi, Datingshi, Boyuangshi, Zhongyangshi, Lülùshi, Lixushi, Xuanyuanshi, Hèxūshi, Zūnlúshi, Zhùróngshi, Fúxi Shi, and Shennong Shi—
at that time, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping,
found their food sweet, their garments fine,
took joy in their customs, and dwelled securely.
Neighboring states, though visible, heard only the sounds of roosters and dogs,
and the people lived out their days to old age without crossing borders.

Thus, what was spoken of was not merely Laozi’s words alone—
ancient times already held this Dao.

Yet the *Shijing* and *Shujing* speak only of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties,
while Laozi sought to return to the governance of primordial antiquity—why so?

It is said: The Dao and the world have long been mutually lost.
Only the Great Dao can restore humanity to its natural way.
To speak of the Dao without reference to its age is insufficient to know
that the Great Dao has been tested.
This is why he again turns to the governance of primordial antiquity.

Yet if the world has long departed from antiquity,
can it be fully restored?

It is said: Not yet possible.
Then what is the purpose of his words?

The rites reached their fullest expression in the harmonization of the Three Sovereigns,
and music attained its completeness in the perfection of the Six Dynasties.
Yet though their forms were perfected,
the rites did not place *xuanshui* and *dajeng* above *lizhou* and harmonized soups,
nor did music elevate the *zhui* flute’s pure tones above the *zhusheng*’s resonant strings—
for this was to make people understand
that the intent of rites and music lay in what they could not avoid,
while their true aim was to return to origins and begin anew.

At that very time,
Confucius sought to restore and continue the fallen traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou,
while Laozi expounded his Dao and its relation to the world in this very way—
his intent was no different.

It is like the moon reaching the *Wei* stem while Fire’s reign begins,
yet the *jin* qi has already arisen within—
this is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.

Thus, when one hears of ancient governance,
though there were ten or a hundred implements, they were not used,
though there were boats and carriages, they were not ridden,
though there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—
yet when great matters arose and great multitudes were gathered,
it was only because there was no alternative.

When one hears that the people used knotted cords for records,
and neighboring states were within sight and hearing,
yet grew old and died without crossing borders—
then the burdensome laws and exhaustive decrees,
the relentless inspections and urgent summonses,
the roads stretching to the borders of neighboring states,
the chariot tracks extending a thousand miles—
these were not by choice, but necessity.

Thus, what was unavoidable was always here,
while what was sung of was always there—
so why would one trouble oneself with excessive governance to correct the people’s faults?

Yet if one seeks to prevent the world from attaining peace and prosperity,
it cannot be done.

If one cuts off the discussion, it is as if one were removing *xuanshui* and discarding *shuyue*—
who would then know the true intent of rites in their simplicity,
or that music’s moderation was meant to return to origins and begin anew?

The words of the Sage—
how could they be mere trifling corrections?

**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech**

Trustworthy speech is not ornate,
ornate speech is not trustworthy.
The virtuous do not argue,
those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not learned,
the learned are not wise.
The Sage has no accumulation—
when he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,
when he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,
the Dao of the Sage acts without contending.
It is said:
*The Dao as a thing—*
you cannot see it, cannot hear it, cannot grasp it,
yet it can be silently understood—
not through reasoning, but through direct attunement.

Thus, trustworthy speech is trust in this alone—
why bother with ornate speech?
Ornate speech is skill in this alone—
why bother with argumentation?
Wise speech is knowledge of this alone—
why bother with breadth?

From this perspective,
it is clear that ornate speech is untrustworthy,
argumentation is unvirtuous,
and breadth is unwise—
for they do not align with the Dao.

The Dao as a thing
has never been a thing at all.
The Sage, in harmony with the Dao,
how could he have any accumulation?
Only because he has no accumulation
does he become one with all things.
When all things become one with him,
he is supremely rich—
thus, when he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,
when he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.

If he had accumulation,
its use would have limits—
how could he grow ever more abundant and ever more plentiful?

Laozi’s words—
observing inwardly into the heart,
observing outwardly into things,
gazing upward to Heaven,
gazing downward to Earth—
nothing escapes his attunement—
this is trustworthiness.

Yet the lesser scholar hears and scoffs,
the world deems him unworthy—
this is unornate speech.
His words are closest yet point farthest—
this is virtue.
Yet he does not speak for pleasure—
this is non-argumentation.
His wisdom reaches the state of no-wisdom—
this is wisdom.
Yet his simplicity never strays from the heart—
this is not breadth.

But scholars seek it through ornate speech, argumentation, and breadth—
they stray far.

The Dao of Laozi
considers accumulation insufficient—
even the Sage abandons and rejects it—
this is non-accumulation,
thus, in utter emptiness, he fulfills all things’ demands—
this is growing ever more abundant and ever more plentiful.

Yet scholars, unable to focus their hearts upon this,
cannot attain it.

All things have what benefits them and what does not—
what does not benefit them cannot but bring harm.
Only the Dao of Heaven,
having nothing that benefits, has nothing that does not benefit—
having nothing that does not benefit, it benefits without harm.

All things that act
inevitably have self—
having self, they contend.
Only the Dao of the Sage,
though acting, does nothing—
doing nothing, it has no self—
having no self, it does not contend—
this is the Dao of Heaven alone.
