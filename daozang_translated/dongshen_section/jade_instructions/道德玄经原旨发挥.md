**Preface to *Exposition on the Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic***

Since Confucius praised Laozi as "like a dragon" and Zhuang Zhou honored him as the "Mysterious Sage," successive dynasties have revered and practiced his teachings, bestowing upon him the highest titles. Observing the span from the Shang to the Zhou—over nine hundred years—Laozi thrice passed through the Hangu Pass, four times held the office of historian, and composed the *Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* in two scrolls. This work, like a bellows harmonizing Heaven and Earth, unifying being and non-being, is truly a book of the unity of Heaven and humanity.

I, Daojian, once composed *The Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic*, which has since been completed. Reflecting on the *Veritable Records* compiled by the recluse Xie Gaoshi, I found its chronological records quite detailed, yet discrepancies in the cited eras remained. Though I long wished to verify and correct them, I was unable. Now, drawing from the *Supreme Principles of the Imperial Ultimate* and its cycles of cosmic transformation, I have collated and annotated the classic’s essential meaning into twelve chapters. I dare not claim originality; rather, I have filled in the lacunae of history.

Confucius, basing his work on the annals of Lu, composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, beginning with King Ping of Zhou. Master Shao, grounding his work in the *Lianshan*, wrote the *Supreme Principles Through the Ages*, starting with Yao. My own *Exposition on the Original Meaning*, rooted in the *Mysterious Classic*, likewise draws upon ancient history for its elaboration. Thus, it cannot but begin with the era before Heaven.

The purpose of this book is not only to verify the ages since the establishment of the Supreme Ultimate but also to infer the signs of what preceded the Ultimate of Non-being. Those who aspire to understand the origins of antiquity may find here material for reflection.

**Exposition on the Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic, Volume One**
**Author:** Du Daojian of Dangtu, a later student of the Teaching

The Sagely Laozi composed the *Mysterious Classic*, naming it after the Dao and its virtue to honor the imperial Dao and exalt the sovereign’s power. Where the Dao and virtue are spoken of, the merits of kings and hegemons are implicit.

I have observed that Master Kangjie (Shao Yong) elucidated the *Supreme Principles* through Laozi, so I, in turn, interpret Laozi through the *Supreme Principles*—both are of the same Dao. Nothing in the world surpasses the Dao and principle. Laozi spoke of the Dao but not of principle, yet principle is surely inherent within it. Between Heaven and Earth, past and present, among rulers, ministers, the people, and all things, each possesses its own principle, qi, image, and number, all deriving from this Dao.

The *Supreme Principles Through the Ages* traces the moral power and achievements of emperors, kings, and hegemons, yet it does not transcend the four aspects of principle, qi, image, and number. Laozi said: "Within the realm, there are four great things: the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great." In my *Exposition* of twelve chapters, the first six elucidate the moral power and achievements of emperors, kings, and hegemons, while the latter six outline Laozi’s birth, transmission of the classic, and journey to the West. How could these discussions exist apart from principle, qi, image, and number? All serve to illuminate the great Dao.

To speak of the principle before Heaven is to speak of the primordial qi. Is not the opening of things an image? And is not number inherent within it? When image and number are complete, the human Dao arises. In the beginning was the Supreme (Taishang), followed by the Three and Five, then kings and hegemons. Metaphorically, the Supreme is spring, the Three and Five summer, kings and hegemons autumn, and winter lies between the closing of things and their reopening. As with the day: dawn, then noon, then dusk. As with the body: youth, then maturity, then old age. Only because the conjunction of cosmic cycles differs do the ages vary in duration. The reader must examine this for themselves.

**Chapter One: Before Heaven**

"Before Heaven" means that which precedes Heaven. Is it not the Dao of Non-being, of emptiness and spontaneity? Laozi said: "Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth," and "The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two." These all describe the Dao before Heaven, which can be grasped in the mind but not sought through words or images.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The Changes possess the Supreme Ultimate, which gives birth to the Two Modes." The *Changes* is the Great Change, the Dao, the Non-Ultimate. "The Changes possess the Supreme Ultimate" is the Dao giving birth to the One. "The One gives birth to the Two" is the Supreme Ultimate giving birth to the Two Modes. Master Zhou said: "The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Non-Ultimate." The *Wenyan* states: "That which precedes Heaven is not opposed; that which follows Heaven accords with the seasons."

On the Dao before Heaven, discussions vary. Where there is a prior, there must be a posterior; where there is prior and posterior, there must be a middle. As seen in the classics, there are three major interpretations: those who take the Supreme Ultimate as the middle consider what precedes it as "before Heaven" and what follows as "after Heaven"—this speaks of the Dao. Those who take Fu Xi’s trigrams as "before Heaven" and King Wen’s hexagrams as "after Heaven" speak of the hexagrams. Those who divide the one cosmic cycle into the first six conjunctions as "before Heaven" and the latter six as "returning Heaven" speak of the ages.

All things in the world, without exception, possess their own Dao before Heaven. To speak of "before Heaven" is to imply "after Heaven." Regarding our own bodies, there is a state before emotions arise and a state before birth. Regarding Heaven and Earth, there is a state before their separation. All are "before Heaven." Is "before Heaven" not the Dao? Is it not that which exists yet is not discussed?

**Chapter Two: The Primordial Beginning**

"The Primordial Beginning" is the beginning of the one cosmic cycle. Laozi said: "There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth," and "The world has a beginning, which may be regarded as the mother of the world," and "To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao."

The *Book of Changes* says: "Great indeed is the primal power of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it." The primal power of Qian is that which begins and brings to fruition. Liezi said: "Before Heaven and Earth, there was nothing."

**Chapter Two: The Primordial Beginning (continued)**

Before there was anything, how could Heaven and Earth arise? It is said: There is *Taiyi* (Grand Simplicity), *Taichu* (Grand Inception), *Taishi* (Grand Commencement), and *Taisu* (Grand Simplicity of Form). Before Heaven and Earth, there are the Five Grand States. Liezi speaks of four but omits *Taiji* (Grand Ultimate). He states: "Qi, form, and substance are all present, yet the myriad things remain undifferentiated, not yet separated." Where there is undifferentiation, *Taiji* is already therein. There must be a divine sovereign presiding over this state. The *Book of Changes* speaks of the divine as that which "subtly brings forth the myriad things"—thus, the sovereign is called *Di* (Emperor), and this is termed the *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning). When the state performs solemn rites to pray to Heaven and seek its mandate, it must do so with fasting and purification, for there is an origin to which it traces. Yao said: "Ah, you, Shun! The celestial reckoning now rests upon you; hold fast to the center." Thus, those who speak of Heaven must borrow the reckoning of time to make it clear. The records of various schools differ, but only Shao Yong’s *Huangji Jingshi* (Supreme Principles Governing the World) can be taken as a model. Its origins trace back to the words of the *Book of Changes* and Laozi, corroborated by the *Canon of Yao*, revering the vast Heaven, observing the celestial bodies of sun, moon, and stars, and verified through the moral power and achievements of emperors, kings, and sages—thus was the book completed.

The *Huangji Jingshi* reckons time by *yuan* (cosmic cycles), *hui* (conjunctions), *yun* (epochs), and *shi* (generations). Its symbols are the sun, moon, and stars. One *yuan* consists of twelve *hui*; one *hui* of thirty *yun*; one *yun* of twelve *shi*; one *shi* of thirty years; one year of twelve months; one month of thirty days; one day of twelve hours; one hour of thirty *fen*; and one *fen* of twelve *miao*. The *Book of Changes* accords with Heaven and Earth, and the *Huangji Jingshi* accords with the *Book of Changes*. Though the *Book of Changes* does not speak of the reckoning of time, it says: "Exhaust its numbers, and the images of the world are thereby determined"—thus, the reckoning of time is implicit. The *Huangji Jingshi* uses twelve and thirty in its method: one *yuan* corresponds to a year, one *hui* to a month, one *yun* to a day, and one *shi* to an hour. One *shi* is thirty years; one *yun* is twelve *shi*, totaling 360 years. One *hui* is thirty *yun*, totaling 10,800 years. One *yuan* is twelve *hui*, totaling 129,600 years. Thus, the reckoning of one *yuan* encompasses Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Beyond the *yuan* lies the *miao*; below the *miao*, there is only that which exists yet is not discussed. Its essential principle is that one *hui* corresponds to a month, and twelve *hui* align with the twelve earthly branches. The qi of Heaven and Earth begins at *zi* and ends at *hai*; the first *hui* corresponds to *zi*, the second to *chou*, and so on through the twelve *hui*, concluding at *hai*. When the end is reached, a new beginning arises—one *yuan* follows another. This is how the Dao begins. Without beginning or end, it is endless. Knowing this, one may wander with the Creator and first attain the center of the circle.

The first *hui* of the *yuan* begins with *Taiyi*:
- *Taiyi*: Day *jia* 1, Month *zi* 1, Star *jia* 1, Earthly Branch *zi* 1—*Taiyi* is the state before qi appears.
The initial year, month, day, and hour of *Taiyi* all commence with *jiazi*. After 5,400 years, *Taichu* arises:
- *Taichu*: Day *jia* 1, Month *zi* 1, Star *ji* 16, Earthly Branch *zi* 181—*Taichu* is when primordial qi first stirs.
Another 5,400 years complete one *hui*, totaling 10,800 years. In the grand scale, this corresponds to the *zi* month of a year; in the small scale, to the *zi* hour of a day. Before Heaven, in the state of *Wuji* (Ultimate Non-being), the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning reaches its utmost stillness and begins to move—one *yang* is born. As Kangjie said: "At the midpoint of the *zi* hour of the winter solstice, the heart of Heaven remains unchanged. Where the first *yang* stirs, the myriad things are yet unborn." This is what he meant.

The second *hui* of the *yuan* brings *Taishi*:
- *Taishi*: Day *jia* 1, Month *chou* 2, Star *jia* 31, Earthly Branch *zi* 361—*Taishi* is when qi and form first take shape.
After 5,400 years, *Taisu* arises:
- *Taisu*: Day *jia* 1, Month *chou* 2, Star *ji* 46, Earthly Branch *zi* 541—*Taisu* is when form transforms and substance emerges.
Another 10,800 years complete the second *hui*, totaling 21,600 years, corresponding to the *chou* month of a year and the *chou* hour of a day. In this state of indistinct images and profound essence, the mysterious and the wondrous merge—two *yang* are born.

The third *hui* of the *yuan* brings *Taiji*:
- *Taiji*: Day *jia* 1, Month *yin* 3, Star *jia* 61, Earthly Branch *zi* 721—*Taiji* is when the myriad things are undifferentiated and not yet separated.
This is what is meant by existing before the chaos was divided, extending beyond qi and form to the realm of images, filling Heaven and Earth, and spanning past and present—something even the great Creator cannot transcend. After 5,400 years, the undifferentiated begins to separate, and the division of *yin* and *yang* commences, corresponding to the *yin* month of a year, the half-month after the new moon, the *yin* hour of a day, and the first four *ke* of the *yin* hour. Here, the images of *Qian* and *Kun* take form, pure and tranquil—three *yang* harmonize, and the myriad things stir and sprout.

The beginning of one *yuan* passes through the Five Grand States, spanning two and a half *hui*, totaling 27,000 years. Shao Yong designated the day as *jia* and the month as *zi* at the beginning of the *yuan*. In my humble opinion, the Five Grand States are reckoned by years because their principles, qi, images, and numbers are already present in the state of "not yet." This is perhaps the *Yi* before the first line is drawn. Laozi said: "The myriad things under Heaven are born of being; being is born of non-being." The reckoning of the *Huangji Jingshi* begins before Heaven and Earth were opened, prior to two and a half *hui*. It concludes after Heaven and Earth have closed, following one and a half *hui*. The three *hui* of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* are like winter in a year and night in a day. If one says there are things, then Heaven and Earth are dark and obscure, and the myriad things lie hidden. If one says there are no things, then in the profound and indistinct, the myriad things are never absent. Thus, it is said: "It begins before Heaven and Earth and ends after them; when it ends, it transforms and flows anew."

Thus, those who lose their way among the twelve *hui* and descend below the *yuan* all call the days "jia," yet they are not one but two, two but three—extending onward in this manner, even the most skilled calendrist cannot fathom it. When Kangjie composed his book, he had no choice but to begin with *tian jia*, yet how could one know there were not already *yuan* from *jia* to *gui*?

I have once said: "Today’s Heaven and Earth were yesterday’s Heaven and Earth. Tomorrow’s Heaven and Earth will be today’s Heaven and Earth." Knowing this, Kangjie’s book may be extrapolated.

**Chapter Three: Opening the Myriad Things**
"Opening the myriad things" refers to the opening of Heaven and Earth. It is said that the myriad things of Heaven and Earth all emerge from this. The *Yi* states: "With Heaven and Earth established, the myriad things are born." Laozi said: "The Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them." Thus, before the opening of the myriad things, the Great Ultimate split, and the forms and substances that completed them became manifest. As for the Dao: in Heaven it is called "spirit," on Earth it is called "treasure," and together they are called "Numinous Treasure."

The day of opening the myriad things is *jia* 1, the month *yin* 3, the star *ji* 76, and the celestial stem *zi* 91. At the inception of opening the myriad things, it was the *jiazi yuan*, the *bingyin hui*, the *jimao yun*, the *jiazi shi*, and the *jiazi* year. At that time, Heaven and Earth took their positions, the dark and yellow coalesced, and the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin was complete. The three *qi* intermingled, and the being of Hun Dun emerged.

According to the *Book of Calendars*: Hun Dun, also called Pan Gu, was born within Heaven and Earth when they were still indistinct, like a chicken’s egg. Each day, he transformed nine times, becoming divine in Heaven and sagely on Earth. Each day, Heaven rose a *zhang*, Earth thickened a *zhang*, and Pan Gu grew a *zhang*. After 18,800 years, Heaven reached its utmost height, Earth its utmost depth, and Pan Gu his utmost length. At the midpoint of Pan Gu’s existence, it corresponded to the fourth *hui* of the *Yuanjing*.

**The Fourth *Hui* of the *Yuanjing***
For Pan Gu, the day was *jia* 1, the month *mao* 4, the star *jia* 91, and the celestial stem *zi* 1,081. Laozi said: "Spirits attain oneness and become numinous." Was Pan Gu the first to embody this? By the reckoning of the *Huangji*, 18,800 years constitute the number of one *hui*. The *qi* intermingled and transformed into purity, embodying the fullness of the Great Ultimate. There was the spirit of the sage, yet no form had yet appeared. In life, he was divinely numinous, reaching the utmost height of Heaven and the utmost depth of Earth, governing and directing *qi* and form, gestating the radiance of the myriad things. In death, his head became the Five Peaks, his eyes the sun and moon, his fat and marrow the rivers and seas, and his hair and beard the grasses and trees. Thus, Pan Gu is the ancestor of the myriad things.

Alas, the tale of Pan Gu may seem far-fetched. Yet when I read the *Yi* and come to "Heaven and Earth take their positions, mountains and marshes exchange *qi*, thunder and wind clash, water and fire do not repel one another," in the space between a single bow and rise, Pan Gu is never absent. How great indeed! When Fu Xi drew the trigrams: *Qian* was Heaven and the head, the trigram of the south. *Kun* was Earth and the belly, the trigram of the north. Heaven and Earth took their positions. *Gen* was the mountain and the nose, the trigram of the northwest (as seen in the *Mayi Yi Commentary*). *Dui* was the marsh and the mouth, the trigram of the southeast. Mountains and marshes exchanged *qi*. *Zhen* was thunder and the feet, the trigram of the northeast. *Xun* was wind and the hands, the trigram of the southwest (as seen in the *Mayi Commentary*). Thunder and wind clashed. *Kan* was water and the ears, the trigram of the west. *Li* was fire and the eyes, the trigram of the east. Water and fire did not repel one another. Combining the images of the eight trigrams, the myriad things are all complete within me. This is why humans are the spirits of the myriad things. Is Pan Gu far from us?

From the opening of the myriad things for 18,800 years, combining three and a half *hui* of the Primordial Beginning, totaling 37,800 years, Pan Gu perished, and the First Heavenly Sovereign emerged.

**Right: Pan Gu’s Division of Form and Transformation into the Myriad Things**
Laozi said: "Heaven attains oneness and becomes clear, Earth attains oneness and becomes tranquil, spirits attain oneness and become numinous, valleys attain oneness and become full, and the myriad things attain oneness and come to life." The *Yi* states: "Heaven is noble, Earth is base, and *Qian* and *Kun* are established. The low and high are arrayed, and the noble and base take their positions. Movement and stillness have constancy, and the hard and soft are determined. Things gather by kind, and beings are divided into groups, giving rise to good and ill fortune. In Heaven, images form; on Earth, shapes take form, and transformations become manifest." From this, one sees that the people are of the same womb, and things share the same origin—all emerge from the single *qi* of Pan Gu.

Pan Gu stood at the juncture between the third and fourth *hui* of the *Yuanjing*. Taking a single day as an analogy, it was the moment when *yin* and *mao* intersected, and the first light of dawn had not yet separated. As for the era of the Heavenly Sovereign, it was the fourth quarter of *mao*, when the great brightness arose in the east, the myriad things flourished together, and the human Dao began. When Hun Dun was split open and Pan Gu died, what was called the innate capacity of yin and yang was attained by the Dao as the Supreme Unity, by Heaven as the Celestial Unity, and by the Emperor as the Imperial Unity. Thus, the sun, moon, and stars became manifest; water, fire, earth, and stone took form; and the flying, walking, grasses, and trees came into being. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, heat, cold, day, and night alternated between darkness and brightness, transformation and change, arrayed in splendor and clarity, numinous and luminous.

According to the *Daoist Canon*, there are references to the years of the Dragon Han and Crimson Brightness, the Supreme Sovereigns—this corresponds to the inception of the opening of the myriad things, when the title of the Supreme Heaven was grand. There was a golden scripture that said: "Transformation and birth." The Heavenly Treasure Lord, the Numinous Treasure Lord, and the Spirit Treasure Lord—all these arose naturally, not through gestation, embodying what is called "the burden of the Supreme Heaven, without sound or scent." Thus, it is said: "Inconceivable."

Some say that Pan Gu inaugurated Heaven and Earth and is the ancestor of the myriad things—how could Heaven and Earth and the myriad things be divided from Pan Gu?

It is said: Not so. Before Pan Gu, Heaven and Earth and the myriad things already possessed the formless image, contained within the undifferentiated whole. Only when Pan Gu emerged did Heaven and Earth and the myriad things take shape.

Thus, taking our own bodies as analogy: dream and wakefulness, life and death are but a single evening and morning—past and present are one. From this perspective, one may equalize the myriad things, unify life and death. Heaven and Earth are without end, things are without end, and I too am without end.

**Chapter Four of the Supreme Venerable**

The Supreme Venerable refers to the Great Antiquity of high antiquity. The Supreme Venerable is without name; the next has name; the next has names upon names.

Laozi said: "Of the Supreme, those below merely know it exists. The next they draw near to and praise. The next they fear, and the next they revile."

The *Traditions* say: "The Supreme establishes virtue; the next establishes merit; the next establishes words."

From the era of the Primordial Heavenly Sovereign down to the Five Hegemons, from non-action to action, from yielding abdication to punitive expeditions, from rise to fall and order to chaos—all are encompassed in the words of intimacy, praise, fear, and scorn. Does this not show the Dao descending ever lower and virtue ever declining?

According to the *Images*, *Taboos*, and *Annals*: the Three Sovereigns and Nine Epochs constitute the Nine Sovereigns. Just as from the Three Dynasties onward, we speak of generations and eras.

First is the Five Dragons Epoch; second, the Union of Heroes Epoch; third, the Mandate of Shu Epoch; fourth, the Linked Continuity Epoch; fifth, the Five Surnames Epoch; sixth, the Cultivated Flight Epoch; seventh, the Governance of Yinti Epoch; eighth, the Abdication and Continuity Epoch; ninth, the Flowing End Epoch.

Again, according to the *River Chart*: the Record of Surnames and Epochs begins with the Union of Heroes, totaling seven, while the Five Dragons and Flowing End are not included.

It is said that in the beginning of the people of high antiquity, male and female united in essence, and the surname originated from the female line. The epoch called Union of Heroes, with its three heads, was termed the Three Generations. After the Union of Heroes perished, descendants transmitted their lifespans, which was called the Mandate of Shu Epoch.

The Continuity Epoch comprised four surnames, producing two generations. With men and women multiplying, they dwelled together in linked continuity—hence the Linked Continuity Epoch. Producing one generation, the Continuity Epoch encompassed five surnames—hence the Five Surnames Epoch.

When the world dwelled in groups, they formed affinities by kind. With men and women multiplying, they divided into nine heads, each with its own dwelling place—thus named the Dwelling Place Clan. Producing thirty-two generations, the strong oppressed the weak, seeking to devour and harm. Among them arose a divine person who governed with upright integrity—thus named the Upright Integrity Clan.

Producing thirty-five generations, the Continuity Epoch comprised seventy-two surnames—hence the Clan of Continuity. The records of various schools differ somewhat, yet there are no transmitted persons or transmitted governments.

Yet it is not that there were no transmitted persons or transmitted governments—rather, the records had not yet come into being, so what could be transmitted? Thus, when tracing from the present back to antiquity, some matters cannot be sought by conjecture; when following from antiquity down to the present, some must be recorded. Let both accounts be provisionally preserved.

As for the constellations of heaven’s stars, the thunderous commands of ghosts and spirits—these do not await the emergence of human culture to be manifest. How radiant and resplendent they are! In the act of looking up and gazing down, the governance of images and symbols is fundamentally rooted in this.

**The First Three Sovereigns**
The Five Dragons Epoch (I): The Five Dragons were five surnames. *The Jade Emperor’s Comprehensive Calendar* renders this as the *Gou Long Epoch*.

**The First Heavenly Sovereign**
- Day: *jia* (1)
- Month: *mao* (4)
- Star: *ji* (1), with 106 celestial stems
- Branch: *zi* (1), with 1,260 days
The Heavenly Sovereign had twelve heads. The twelve heads were twelve persons, as recorded in Huangfu Mi’s *Three and Five Calendar*.

At the inception of primordial *qi*, there arose a divine person called the Heavenly Sovereign, lord of the first creatures and the first people. He established the ultimate standard and fixed the positions, and his spiritual transformations were inexhaustible. (From Xu Zheng’s *Records of the Three and Five Calendars*.)

When creatures first arose and people first emerged, they shared the same *qi* as animals, their forms not yet distinct. Thus, there were those with serpent bodies and human heads, or human bodies and bovine heads—just as the twenty-eight lunar lodges of heaven and the twelve earthly palaces are named after birds and beasts. For birds and beasts, like humans, are born bearing the essence of celestial stars and earthly spirits, hence humans are called "guardians of the numinous." From this, we know that the people of the Heavenly Sovereign lived without thought or action, like infants who have not yet learned to laugh. They feasted on primordial *qi* and drank harmony, embracing the Dao in its natural state. Laozi said: "Those who hold virtue in abundance are like newborn infants: poisonous insects do not sting them, fierce beasts do not seize them, birds of prey do not strike them." At that time, people lived over a thousand years, their descendants succeeding one another for fifteen epochs, totaling 5,400 years.

When the First Heavenly Sovereign passed, the First Earthly Sovereign arose, corresponding to the fifth epoch of the *Primary Classic’s Conjunctions*.

**The Fifth Epoch of the Primary Classic’s Conjunctions**
The Conjoined Potency Epoch (II): The Conjoined Potency comprised three surnames. The *Spring and Autumn Annals’ Apocrypha* renders this as the *He Zhui Epoch*; the *Initial Placement of Heaven and Earth Classic* as the *Han Xiong Epoch*; and the *Comprehensive Mirror’s External Records* as the *She Ti Epoch*.

**The First Earthly Sovereign**
- Day: *jia* (1)
- Month: *chen* (5)
- Star: *jia* (1), with 121 celestial stems
- Branch: *zi* (1), with 1,441 days
The Earthly Sovereign had eleven heads—eleven persons.

Succeeding the First Heavenly Sovereign, his virtue aligned with nature, and his achievements assisted heaven and earth. He fixed the stars, divided day and night, regulated *yin* and *yang*, and ordered the cold and heat. The four seasons followed their sequence, the people flourished, trees bent, grasses sprouted, and creatures of scales, shells, feathers, and fur—both flying and hidden—each attained their proper growth. From this, we know that the people of the Earthly Sovereign were like infants who had learned to laugh, feeding on mist and consuming fungi, free from hunger, satiety, or toil. Laozi said: "Can you embrace the One and not let it slip away? Can you concentrate your *qi* and attain suppleness, like a newborn child?" At that time, the longest-lived still reached a thousand years, their descendants succeeding one another for half an epoch, totaling 5,400 years.

When the First Earthly Sovereign passed, the First Human Sovereign arose.

**The Third Epoch of the Linked Continuity**
The Linked Mandate Epoch (III): The Linked Mandate comprised four surnames. The *Heaven and Earth Classic* renders this as the *Thick Mandate Epoch*; the *Comprehensive Calendar* as the *Mysterious Mandate Epoch*; and the *External Records* as the *He Luo Epoch*.

**The First Human Sovereign**
- Day: *jia* (1)
- Month: *chen* (5)
- Star: *ji* (1), with 136 celestial stems
- Branch: *zi* (1), with 1,620 days
The Human Sovereign had nine heads—nine persons.

At that time, living kinds multiplied like children who had grown from infancy to youth. Human nature was newly carved, and desires gradually sprouted. They donned leaves, slept on grasses, ate fruits, drank water, and dwelled in the wild with the young and old. Lacking the sharp claws and teeth to fend off fierce beasts, and without the division of officials and people to restrain the strong and weak, the strong devoured the weak, and the people could not endure their condition. Thus, they assessed the terrain of mountains, rivers, and lands, dividing the Nine Provinces. Each of the nine heads resided in one, ruling as its chief. The Human Sovereign dwelled at the center, governing the eight auxiliaries—hence the Nine Heads Epoch. Laozi said: "Grasp the great image, and all under heaven will come to you without harm, secure and at peace." Their descendants succeeded one another for 5,400 years.

When the First Human Sovereign passed, the Middle Heavenly Sovereign emerged, corresponding to the sixth epoch of the *Primary Classic’s Conjunctions*.

According to the records, the First Heavenly Sovereign succeeded Pangu in ruling the world, together with the First Earthly Sovereign and the First Human Sovereign, governing for one and a half epochs, totaling 16,400 years. Including the previous five epochs, the cumulative span was 54,000 years.

The eras of the first Three Sovereigns should have varied in length, yet all are recorded as precisely 5,400 years. However, when reckoned by the supreme standard, though days may wax and wane, the days of a month do not exceed thirty. Though months may be long or short, the months of a year do not exceed twelve. Days, months, and years are the small cycles; epochs, conjunctions, and eras are the great cycles. From this, we know that when creatures first arose and people first emerged, primordial *qi* was undifferentiated, without striving or desire, lost in the obscurity of mutual oblivion. Lifespans stretched endlessly, and no harm befell them. Thus, Laozi said: "The sage engages in non-action and practices wordless teaching. The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse them; he gives them life but does not possess them; he acts but does not rely on them."

I have often sighed: Later ages possess the lands of the Three Sovereigns, yet the Three Sovereigns have no people of later ages. If those who rule could make these people into the people of the Three Sovereigns, to dwell broadly in the lands of the Three Sovereigns, then the original intent of Laozi’s writings would not be mere empty words.

**The Middle Three Sovereigns**
The Sixth Epoch of the *Primary Classic’s Conjunctions*

**The Fourth Epoch of the *Comprehensive Record*: "Lian Tong"**
*Lian Tong* comprises six clans. Alternately rendered as *Lian Yao Ji*.

**The Middle Heavenly Sovereign Clan**
A day spans one *jia*, a month six *si*; a star’s cycle spans 151 *jia*, a celestial revolution 1,801 *zi*.

The Middle Heavenly Sovereign, styled the Grand Sovereign Clan, succeeded the First Human Sovereign to reign at the dawn of the Six Conjunctions. The people of that age resembled youths newly come of age—truly insufficient to stave off hunger. They took edible creatures to fill their bellies, content in simplicity, free from strife or contention. Though rulers governed them, the people remained at ease in their old ways.

Bo Yangfu said: "In the grand antiquity of the Two Sovereigns, there stood a lord who attained the Dao. The central spirit and transformative power extended to all four quarters, thus pacifying the realm. Therefore, he could harmonize heaven’s motion and earth’s stagnation, ensuring ceaseless circulation. Waters flowed without end, accompanying the myriad things from beginning to end. Dynasties succeeded one another, spanning five thousand four hundred years."

When the Middle Heavenly Sovereign Clan passed, the Middle Earthly Sovereign Clan emerged.

**The Fifth Epoch of the *Comprehensive Record*: Five Clans**
As the *River Chart* states: *Tong Ji* of five clans.

**The Middle Earthly Sovereign Clan**
A day spans one *jia*, a month six *si*; a star’s cycle spans 166 *ji*, a celestial revolution 1,981 *zi*.

The Middle Earthly Sovereign, styled the Nest-Builder Clan, succeeded the Grand Sovereign Clan to reign. In that era, mountains lacked paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. The myriad things flourished in their native lands; beasts gathered in herds, grasses and trees grew unchecked. People dwelt in the wild, unable to withstand the venom of tigers, wolves, serpents, and boars. The Nest-Builder Clan taught them to fashion nests from timber, thereby evading harm.

In winter they dwelt in caves, in summer in nests, thus prepared against cold and heat, unharmed by birds or insects. Thereafter the people dwelt in peace. Nine heads of the realm all submitted and revered them. Their descendants succeeded one another through five epochs, spanning 1,800 years in all. When the Middle Earthly Sovereign Clan passed, the Middle Human Sovereign Clan emerged.

**The Sixth Epoch of the *Comprehensive Record*: Six Epochs, Nine Clans**
The *River Chart* names them the *Ju Fang* Clan; the *Outer Records* calls them the *Xun Fei* Epoch.

**The Middle Human Sovereign Clan**
A day spans one *jia*, a month six *si*; a star’s cycle spans 171 *ji*, a celestial revolution 2,041 *zi*.

The Middle Human Sovereign, styled the Fire-Driller Clan, succeeded the Nest-Builder Clan to reign. In that era, people still dwelt in nests and caves, drinking blood and eating raw flesh, which harmed their stomachs and intestines, gradually leading to early death. The Fire-Driller Clan first taught them to drill wood for fire, roasting raw food to make it cooked, avoiding the rank and foul, nourishing life and benefiting nature, thereby following the Dao of Heaven—hence the name Fire-Driller Clan. The people of the realm, sated with cooked flavors, walked with full bellies, their steps steady, their gaze serene. Yin and yang harmonized, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their order, and the myriad things flourished without harm, living out their natural spans.

Laozi said: *Those who govern the realm by the Dao—even their ghosts do not act as spirits.* Not that their ghosts lack spirit, but their spirit does not harm people. Not that their spirit does not harm people, but the sage also does not harm people. When neither harms the other, virtue and power converge in them.

Their descendants succeeded one another for 1,310 years, after which the Heavenly Sovereign Clan arose.

Now, in the age of the Three Middle Sovereigns, the customs of the people were truly pure. Whenever one became a ruler or leader, if they did not establish great works, the people would not praise them. Thus the Nest-Builder Clan gained its name from building nests, and the Fire-Driller Clan from drilling fire—each was named by the people for their merits and virtues. Their descendants thereafter took these as clan names. Among Fuxi’s feudal lords, there still remained those of the Nest-Builder Clan, and later they became successive rulers, one of whom was titled the Great Nest-Builder Clan—showing that the name did not derive from a single nest.

**Three Chapters, Five Epochs**
Three chapters for the Three Sovereigns, five epochs for the Five Emperors.

Laozi said: "The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue. The lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue. The highest virtue acts without contrivance and without purposeful action. The lesser virtue acts with contrivance and with purposeful action."

The *Commentary* states: "The supreme establishes virtue"—this refers to the highest virtue. The highest virtue follows the Dao, hence it is said: "The supreme establishes virtue." This encompasses the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.

Zhuangzi said: "The people of antiquity dwelled in primordial chaos, moving through the world with serene indifference." This is called the utmost unity. In that age, none acted, yet all was naturally so. As virtue gradually declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to rule the world—thus they followed the Dao but did not attain unity in virtue. As virtue further declined, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to rule the world—thus they brought stability but did not follow the Dao in virtue. With further decline came Yao and Shun, who initiated the currents of governance and transformation, diluting purity and scattering simplicity—the ancient Way was altered.

In Zhuangzi’s time, he must have glimpsed ancient histories, for his ordering of later ages aligns closely with other accounts. The Middle Three Sovereigns spanned eight thousand five hundred and ten years, totaling sixty-two thousand five hundred and ten years when combined with the preceding era. Thereafter, the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi arose.

The Later Three Sovereigns followed the *Seven Canons of Ti Ji*; the *River Chart* names them the *Ti Ting Clan*. The Heavenly Sovereign’s era began with the day *jia* and the month *si*, the star *ding* and the first of the seventy-four celestial markers, and the second of the two thousand eighty-four terrestrial branches.

The Heavenly Sovereign, titled Fuxi, bore the surname Feng. The year commenced with *Sheti*, beginning with the *jia-yin* cycle. He ruled by the virtue of Wood and established his capital at Taihao’s ruins. He taught the people to domesticate animals, and thus took his name.

Forging metal into tools, he taught the people to cook food, and was thus also named Paoxi. Gazing above and examining below, drawing from near and seeking afar, he drew the Eight Trigrams, created written characters, and devised the calendar of *jia* stems. He knotted cords to make nets and traps, for hunting and fishing, and thus the sagely office of teaching and transformation flourished.

At that time, the people dwelled in groups, and the fundamental norms had yet to be established. Fuxi’s virtue harmonized above and below, modeling the Two Modes to rectify the principles of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife—thereby correcting human relationships.

Succeeding Heaven in his reign, he became the first of the hundred kings and was honored as the Heavenly Sovereign. Taihao ruled for one hundred sixteen years, and his line passed through Nüwa to Wuhuai, spanning fifteen generations and one thousand three hundred seven years, whereupon the Earthly Sovereign Shennong arose.

According to records, Gonggong was a vassal of Fuxi. Later, the Zhurong clan descended from him. Shennong was called the Flame Emperor. By the time of Yao, there appeared another named Gonggong—likely descendants who continued in office and took it as their surname.

The *Comprehensive Records of Abdications* lists eight abdications; *Abdication and Continuity*, seventy-two surnames. The *River Chart* calls it the *Record of Continued Surnames*.

The Earthly Sovereign’s era began with the day *jia* and the month *si*, the star *xin* and the one hundred seventy-eighth celestial marker, and the fourth of the two thousand one hundred twenty-eight terrestrial branches.

The Earthly Sovereign, titled Shennong, bore the surname Jiang. The year commenced with *xinchou*, and he ruled by the virtue of Fire, establishing his capital at Lu. At that time, the people ate raw food and fell ill, as yin and yang assailed one another. Shennong tasted the hundred herbs and fashioned the hundred medicines to heal them.

He taught the people the benefits of the plow and hoe, sowing the hundred grains. Thus, the people came to eat cooked food. At midday, markets were held, where goods were exchanged, and the people found it fitting. The chieftain Fusa of the vassal state rebelled and refused the command; Jiven admonished him but was killed. Shennong cultivated virtue, and the people of Fusa themselves attacked their ruler and submitted. His territory extended south to Jiaozhi, north to Youdu, west to Sanwei, and east to Yanggu. He reigned for one hundred forty years, passing the throne through eight generations from Linkui to Yugang, spanning five hundred twenty-six years, after which the Human Sovereign arose. The *Liuqi Ji* is also called the *Shuge Ji*. The *Xiao Sima’s Records of the Three Sovereigns* states: The *Liuqi Ji* corresponds to the time of the Yellow Emperor, placed among the nine eras.

The Human Sovereign’s era began with the day *jia* and the month *si*, the star *ren* and the one hundred seventy-ninth celestial marker, and the ninth of the two thousand one hundred forty-five terrestrial branches. The Human Sovereign, titled Xuanyuan, bore the surname Gongsun and was raised by the Ji River, whence he took the surname Ji. The year commenced with *gengzi*, and he ruled by the virtue of Earth, establishing his capital at Xuanyuan’s Mound, after which he was named. Inheriting the decline of Yugang, Chiyou defied the command; battle was joined at Zhuolu, and he was executed in central Ji. Thereupon, he appointed officials by the Cloud Register, raising Feng Hou, Li Mu, Tai Shan, Ji Chang, and Xian Da Hong, obtaining six ministers, by whom the world was ordered and the numinous powers arrived. Following this, Tai Chang, She Long, Zhu Rong, Da Feng, and Hou Tu, along with Cang Jie and their peers, were charged with their duties. They first built palaces and halls, boats and carts, mortars and pestles, bows and arrows, coffins and outer coffins, and cast bells and tripods. They harnessed oxen and rode horses to benefit the world. He commanded Cang Jie to create writing, and thus caps and robes, culture and ritual, music and laws flourished. He then had Xi He observe the sun, Chang Yi the moon, Che Qu the stars and qi, and Da Rao create the *jiazi* cycle—some say Fu Xi ordered Da Rao to devise the calendar, perhaps passing the office through generations. Ling Lun crafted the twelve pitches, Li Shou invented calculation, and Rong Cheng synthesized these six arts, completing the books on yin-yang and calendrical systems. He divided the wilds into provinces, demarcated the land into well-fields, so the people did not contend, officials acted without self-interest, markets did not fix prices, and wealth was shared. The four barbarians presented tribute, and the feudal lords all submitted—this was the Yellow Emperor. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelled on Kongtong Mountain, he went to pay homage and seek the Dao. He reigned for one hundred years, then ascended to the heavens in clouds from Dinghu. The Yellow Emperor had twenty-five sons; fourteen lineages bore his surname, branching into twelve clans: Ji, You, Qi, Ji, Teng, Zhen, Ren, Xun, Xi, Gu, Huan, and Yi. His principal consort, Leizu, bore two sons: Xuanxiao, known as Qingyang, and Changyi, known as the Marquis of Ruoshui.

According to the *Records* and *Annals*, there were nine sovereigns, which, when examined by the nine eras, comprise the three Human, Earthly, and Heavenly Sovereigns of the beginning, middle, and end. The Heavenly duty is to cover, the Earthly duty to bear, and the Sage’s duty to teach—thus the sage establishes the ultimate for the people and opens up affairs for the world and posterity. How could he have any concern for titles and names?

Fu Xi’s line passed through Nüwa, Dating, Baihuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lilian, Hexu, Zunlu, Hundun, Haoying, Youchao, Zhuxiang, Getian, Yinkang, and Wuhuai, totaling fifteen clans. Verifying this against Fu Xi’s decrees, Dating and Wuhuai—ten clans in all—were all ministers under Fu Xi’s divided rule. How could one person first serve as Fu Xi’s minister and later succeed him as sovereign? It must be that each clan’s descendants inherited the rule in turn. For instance, Nüwa, as Fu Xi’s successor, performed the feat of mending the heavens. Fu Xi reigned for over a hundred years before passing, yet it is also said that Nüwa succeeded him as ruler, reigning for one hundred thirteen years. It must be that those who succeeded as rulers were Nüwa’s descendants. The same applies to Wuhuai.

Shennong’s line passed through eight generations: Emperor Linkui, Emperor Cheng, Emperor Ming, Emperor Zhi, Emperor Li, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Yugang. Calculating by the *jiazi* cycles of their reigns, Xuanyuan’s era, together with those of Fu Xi and Shennong, spanned one thousand nine hundred thirty-three years, concluding the nine eras.

Furthermore, according to the *Old Ceremonies of the Han*, sacrifices were offered to the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Nine Sovereigns, and sixty-four clans—eighty-one surnames in all—all ancient rulers. Thus, Zheng Sinong, in his commentary on the *Rites of Zhou*, categorized the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Nine Sovereigns, and sixty-four clans as four types of lineages. Additionally, the *Zhouhu Record* states: The Sovereign line lasted four generations; Shushan Youkui, six; Hundun, seven; Dongku, seven; Huangtan, seven; Qitong, three; Jiyi, four; Ji Qu, one; Xi Wei, four; Dachao, two; Sui Huang, four; and Yongcheng, eight—totaling sixty-eight generations, forming the *Yinti Ji*. Cang Jie lasted one generation; Xiang Huang, twenty; Zhongyang, four; Dating, five; Lilu, five; Lilian, eleven; Xuanyuan, three; Hexu, one; Getian, four; Zonglu, five; Zhu Rong, two; Haoying, nine; Youchao, seven; Zhuxiang, three; Yinkang, two; and Wuhuai, six—totaling eighty-eight generations, forming the *Shantong Ji*. There were also the Juling, Goujiang, Qiaoming, Zhuoguang, and Cimin clans, collectively called the *Xunfei Ji*, who had titles but no recorded generations. Above these, only the Nine Sovereigns, Earthly Sovereign, and Heavenly Sovereign remain.

Moreover, in highest antiquity there was Pan Gu, who laid the foundation. According to the *Lüliang Stele*, there were seventy-two ancient clans that performed the feng and shan sacrifices, though Guan Yiwu recognized only twelve. Other texts record even more ancient clan titles, but they are too scattered to verify. Here, I have gathered the Nine Records and the Nine Sovereigns as the core, neither daring to lose myself in vagueness nor to omit anything through negligence. Laozi said: "Only one who knows antiquity may be called a master of the Dao’s records."

The Shaohao clan: the day *jia*, the month *si* six; the star *gui*, one hundred eighty; the celestial stem *zi*, two thousand one hundred forty-nine *xuanyuan* years. His son was named Qingyang, of the Ji clan, who succeeded the Yellow Emperor as king. His reign began in the *jimao* year, the *zi* + six year of the celestial stem cycle. On the day he received the Mandate, a phoenix arrived, so he used birds to organize his officials and ruled by the virtue of Metal. His capital was at Qufu, and he was called the Metal Celestial Clan. He followed the seasons to welcome the qi, illuminating the harmony between gods and men. For his ability to uphold the laws of Taihao, he was honored as Shaohao. In his later years, the Nine Li clans disrupted virtue, mingling humans and spirits in chaos, making all things indistinguishable. The people lost their proper sacrifices, and every household became shamans and scribes. Offerings were made without measure, gods became too familiar with the people, and blessings ceased to descend. With nothing to offer, disasters multiplied. After eighty-four years on the throne, he passed the Mandate to Zhuanxu.

He had two sons: Chong and Qiaoji.

The Zhuanxu clan: the day *jia*, the month *si* six; the star *gui*, one hundred eighty; the celestial stem *mao*, two hundred fifty-two *xuanyuan* years. He was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor, son of Changyi, of the Ji clan. At ten, he assisted Shaohao; at twelve, he came of age; at twenty, he succeeded to the throne. His reign began in the *renyin* year, the *mao* nine year of the celestial stem cycle. He ruled by the virtue of Water, with his capital at Wei, later renamed Diqiu. He later moved to Gaoyang and was called the Gaoyang Clan. He cultivated resources to suit the land and followed the seasons to emulate Heaven. He appointed Chong, the Southern Regulator, to govern the heavens and oversee the gods, and Li, the Fire Regulator, to govern the earth and oversee the people. He restored the old statutes, preventing mutual encroachment. He created a calendar with *yin* as the first month, so that the first day of the year coincided with the beginning of spring, and the five planets gathered in the Encampment mansion. His domain extended in four directions, matching the lands of Shennong. His laws stipulated that if a woman walking on the road did not yield to a man, she would be punished.

At the crossroads of the four directions, he commanded the Flying Dragons to emulate the sounds of the Eight Winds, composing the *Chengyun* music to sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor. He reigned for seventy-eight years, and was succeeded by his son, Qiongchan.

Emperor Yao’s chronology: Day *jia* 1, Month *si* 6, Star *gui* 180, Celestial Stem *si* 2,154.

Shaohao’s grandson, Jiao Ji’s son, was fifteen when he assisted Zhuanxu in governance. After fifteen years, he succeeded to the realm. Beginning in the year *jiwei*, in the twenty-sixth year of the *chen-si* cycle, he ruled by the virtue of Wood, with his capital at Bo, and was called the Gaoxin Clan. He appointed Heixian to compose the nine melodies of *Jiuzhao*, *Jiulie*, and *Liuying*, while Chui crafted drums, bells, chimes, *ling* pipes, *xun* ocarinas, and *chi* flutes. He commanded the phoenix and celestial pheasant to dance, thereby pacifying the emperor’s virtue, aligning with Heaven, and relieving the people. He cultivated himself, and the world submitted. He had four sons: Qi, Liang, Zhi, and Yao.

Before Shaohao, the titles of the world reflected their virtue, and the names of the hundred officials mirrored their portents. From Zhuanxu onward, the titles of the world followed their lands, and the names of the hundred officials followed their duties.

Yao’s name means "extreme," for he could exhaustively embody the Dao and virtue, ordering the Three Luminaries to secure the people. Thus, he was called Emperor Yao. He reigned for forty-six years, after which Emperor Zhi succeeded him. Beginning in the year *jiwei*, Zhi was dissolute and unrestrained, neglecting good governance. After nine years, he was deposed, having reigned in total for fifty-five years.

Emperor Yao’s chronology: Day *jia* 1, Month *si* 6, Star *gui* 180, Celestial Stem *wei* 2,156.

Emperor Yao, son of Yao, bore the clan name Yiqi and the personal name Fangxun. Initially enfeoffed as the Lord of Tang, at sixteen, when Emperor Zhi was deposed, the multitude elevated the Lord of Tang to the imperial throne. Beginning in the year *jiachen*, in the eleventh year of the *chen-wei* cycle, he ruled by the virtue of Fire, with his capital at Pingyang, and was called the Tang Clan. Ascending amid the decline and deposition of Zhi, when the people’s sustenance was dire, he cultivated virtue and esteemed frugality. His earthen steps were but three feet high, his thatched roofs untrimmed, his rafters unhewn, his palace walls unwhitewashed. He drank from a hollowed gourd ladle, demonstrating to the people simplicity and plainness. If one person starved, he would say, "It is I who have starved them." If one person froze, he would say, "It is I who have frozen them."

If one person committed a crime, he would say, "It is I who have led them astray." The Hundred Clans bore him as the sun and moon, cherished him as father and mother. He commanded Xi and He to reverently observe the celestial patterns, charting the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and respectfully granting the seasons to the people. The cycle comprised three hundred and sixty-six days, with intercalary months added. Thus the four seasons were fixed, and the year completed. The year was called *zai*, with the first month established at *yin*. He then dispatched Xizhong, Xishu, Hezhong, and Heshu to govern the Four Peaks, faithfully ordering the hundred officials, so that all undertakings flourished.

Yet, as the era neared the end of the sixth conjunction, Water failed to moisten below. In the sixty-first year of Yao’s reign, the year *jiachen*, the Great Flood began its devastation. He commanded Gun to regulate the waters for nine years, but his efforts bore no success. Yao consulted the Four Peaks, saying: "I have reigned for seventy years and shall yield the throne." The Peaks replied: "There is an unmarried man below." Yao asked: "Who is he?" They answered: "Yu of Shun." Thereupon, he bestowed his two daughters as consorts upon Yu of Shun and tested him for three years, saying: "Ah! You, Shun, the celestial reckoning now rests upon your person. Faithfully hold to the center." He then abdicated the throne to Shun.

Yao reigned for seventy years. In the year *guichou*, Shun was summoned to service and tested for three years. In the midst of the seventy-first year, the year *bingchen*, he received the Mandate. At the Hall of Ancestral Writings, he acted as regent for twenty-eight years. In the year *guiwei*, Yao passed away, having lived one hundred and sixteen years.

Emperor Shun’s reign began in the year *guiwei*, under the virtue of Earth. A descendant of Zhuanxu five generations removed from his son Qiongchan, he was born at Yaoxu, of the Yao clan, and named Chonghua. Initially obscure, he was called the Yu Clan. He made pottery by the riverbank, tilled the fields at Lishan, and fished at Weirui.

Yao bestowed his two daughters in marriage to him, subjected him to trials of every hardship, and after three years of assessing his merits, then invested him with the throne. He aligned the Seven Governors with the *xuanji* and jade balance, offered grand sacrifices to the Supreme Emperor, reverently presented the *yin* offerings to the Six Ancestors—comprising the four seasons, cold and heat, sun and moon, stars and constellations, floods and droughts—gazed in worship toward the mountains and rivers, and performed distant sacrifices to all the myriad spirits, including those not recorded in the sacrificial canons. He gathered the Five Auspicious Signs, convened the Four Peaks and the regional governors, and distributed the auspicious tokens to the drought officials.

He toured the Four Peaks, established the Twelve Provinces, enfeoffed the Twelve Mountains, banished the Four Malefactors, and consulted the Four Peaks and the Twelve Governors. Boyu was appointed Minister of Works to regulate the waters and earth; Ji sowed the seasonal grains; Xie was made Minister of Instruction; Gaoyao served as Judge; Chui oversaw the artisans, meticulously ordering the names of the Hundred Crafts; Yi was appointed Forester, managing the grasses, trees, birds, and beasts; Boyi presided over the Three Rituals—sacrifices to the celestial spirits, offerings to the earthly deities, and rites honoring the human dead, arranging the order of their veneration; Kui directed music, instructing the young nobles; and Long served as Intermediary, conveying the words between high and low to suppress slander and eradicate misconduct.

Yu, Chui, Yi, Boyi, Kui, and Long—these six men were newly appointed to their offices. The Four Peaks and Twelve Governors totaled twenty-two. When Shun was about to relinquish the throne, he said, "Come, Yu. The celestial reckoning rests upon your person. You shall ultimately ascend as the Supreme Sovereign."

Shun was thirty when summoned to service, served for thirty years, was tested for three, and also spent twenty-eight years as regent during the period of summons and service. He observed three years of mourning. In the year *bingxu*, he arrived at the Hall of Ancestral Writings and later moved to Puyang. He reigned for thirty-three years. In the year *dingsi*, he commanded Yu to act as regent for seventeen years, then ascended to the northern regions and died.

Excluding the years of summons and service, his reign combined with Yu’s regency totaled fifty years. He lived one hundred and ten years.

From Shaohao to Shun, there were six emperors in all. Zhi was deposed and appended to Gaoxin, thus excluded from the ranks of the Five Emperors. In total, three hundred and fifty years elapsed. From the initial era of *Taiyi*, sixty-four thousand seven hundred and ninety-three years had accumulated. In the year *dingsi*, Yu received the Mandate, and after seven more years, the first six conjunctions concluded.

Laozi said: "When the Dao is lost, then virtue arises; when virtue is lost, then benevolence arises." This speaks of the insufficiency of the sovereign Dao, descending into the virtue of emperors. When the virtue of emperors is insufficient, it descends further into the benevolence and righteousness of kings.

Yao, Shun, and Yu’s transmissions of rule coincided with the conjunctions of heaven and earth, dividing the era at its midpoint. Earlier scholars, in their *Canon of World Eras*, distinguished the *Huang* (Sovereign) and *Di* (Emperor) as the first six celestial conjunctions, and the *Wang* (King) and *Bo* (Hegemon) as the latter six. Thus, when the reckoning of the six conjunctions ended, the Great Flood brought calamity. Had there not emerged men like Yao, Shun, and Yu, the people would have become like fish and turtles. Therefore, the world extolled them.

I have once argued that Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Zhi, and Emperor Yao constitute the Five Emperors, with Yu as the first of the Three Kings, and Shun positioned between Yao and Yu. The Grand Historian, deeming Emperor Zhi devoid of the Dao and Shun possessed of great virtue, demoted Zhi and elevated Shun—was this not a lesson to be heeded?

Upon examining the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Era*, at the beginning of the era, the day was *jia*-one, the month *zi*-one, the star *jia*-one, and the celestial stem *zi*-one. Thereafter, the era governed the conjunctions, the conjunctions governed the revolutions, and the revolutions governed the generations, each following in succession. The count accumulated to the sixth conjunction, corresponding to the sixth month, the one hundred and eightieth star, and the two thousand one hundred and forty-ninth celestial stem, before the *jiazi* cycle began. In the sixteenth year, *jimao*, Shaohao received the Mandate. Passing through Zhuanxu and Gaoxin, it reached the two thousand one hundred and fifty-sixth celestial stem, corresponding to the *jiawu* generation. Eleven years later, in the year *jiachen*, Yao received the Mandate. From this point onward, the text ( ) recorded the *jiazi* cycle to chronicle years and events—perhaps this marked the beginning of Danao’s creation of the system.

The chapter on Kings and Hegemons concludes.

The Three Kings were [those of] Xia, Shang, and Zhou. The Five Hegemons were [those of] Qi, Chu, Qin, Jin, and Song.

Yǔ in the year *jiāzi* **甲子**, having divided the first cycle, initiated the seventh conjunction. He succeeded Yáo and Shùn but preceded Tāng and Wǔ, and his achievements were also grand.

Lǎozi said: *"When virtue is at its highest, they act without expectation of reward; when righteousness is at its highest, they act with expectation of reward; when propriety is at its highest, none respond to them—then they roll up their sleeves and force compliance."* He also said: *"When virtue is lost, then comes righteousness; when righteousness is lost, then comes propriety; when propriety is lost, then comes ritual."*

The annals state: *"The next [stage] is to establish deeds, then to establish words."* Like Yǔ’s taming of the waters, which carried out the principle of *wu shì* (無事, "no idle hands"), his merit extended to ten thousand generations—was this not the establishment of deeds?

Later, he descended to become a Hegemon, and further still to institute ritual and music. When warfare began among the great officers, it showed that his virtue and righteousness were lost, and the thinness of his rituals became apparent.

Thus, Mèngzǐ also said: *"Yáo and Shùn acted according to their nature; Tāng and Wǔ acted with their own bodies; the Five Hegemons relied on external means."*

Shào Shì remarked: *"The seventh conjunction entered the period of Yin’s prolonged growth, lacking any Yang’s ascending conjunction. Though Yin and Yang alternate in their revolutions and have their times of waxing and waning, can virtue and power alone not alternate in their manifestation?"*

**Xia Yǔ**—in the year *jiāzi* **甲**, the first month *yǐ* (巳), the 6th day; the star *guǐ* (癸), the 180th; the celestial stem *hài* (亥), the 2161st—bore the surname **Zǐ** (子), was named **Wénmìng** (文命), and was the grandson of Zhuanxu’s son Gǔn. In the year *bǐngchén* (丙辰), Shùn recommended him to Heaven, and Yǔ ascended to the Mandate.

In the year *dìngsì* (丁巳), after seventeen years of regency, when he reached the seventh conjunction of the first cycle, Yǔ in the year *jiāzi* **甲**, the first month *wǔ* (午), the 7th day; the star *jiǎ* (甲), the 181st; the celestial stem *zǐ* (子), the 2161st—after seventeen years of regency, in the year *guǐyǒu* (癸酉), Shùn ascended to the Field of Heaven and died, and Yǔ took the throne as King.

He ruled with the virtue of Metal, established *yín* (寅) as the correct orientation, and established his capital at Píngyáng. Initially, Yǔ inherited his father’s title of **Chóng Bó** (崇伯), hence his name **Bó Yǔ**.

He served as the **Sīkōng** (司空, Minister of Works), leveling lands and controlling waters. The *Shū* (Book of Documents) says: *"Yǔ rode in four vehicles: by water in a boat, on land in a carriage, in mud on a shield, and in mountains on a raft. He carved wood to follow mountains, drained the nine rivers to reach the four seas, deepened the ditches and canals to separate the rivers, apportioned the lands and set their tributes, took a wife from Mount Túshān, and begot his son Qǐ."*

For eight years, he passed three times by his door without entering, only to survey the wilds and measure the lands. He established the Five Regions, completing them in twenty-seven years, with each region containing five hundred states, totaling five thousand. Every state was five hundred *lǐ* (里) in extent, and the Five Regions spanned two thousand five hundred *lǐ*. East to west, the distance was five thousand *lǐ*; north to south, the same. There were twelve **Shòu** (師, regional governors) and three thousand *lǐ* of **Dàn Hóu** (甸侯, frontier lords) and **Xuàn Fāng** (缓方, distant regions), all within the Nine Regions. Outside the Nine Regions, the Four Seas were bordered by a thousand *lǐ* of **Yāo** (要, key territories) and **Huāng** (荒, frontier lands), each governed by five **Cháng** (長, officials). Those who had merit were rewarded, and the Six Ministries were established, making the Three Regions complete, and taxes were levied on the Central State.

At the beginning of Yǔ’s Mandate, the **Mǎoyǐ** (有苗) people did not submit. He assembled the feudal lords and swore at **Shī** (師): *"Proceed with order, all heed my commands! The Mǎoyǐ are dull-witted and disrespectful, arrogant and self-glorifying, reversing the Dao and undermining virtue. The virtuous are in the wilderness, the wicked hold office, the people abandon and do not protect [them]. Heaven’s punishment descends upon them. Now, you officers, carry out my words and punish their crimes!"*

The Mǎoyǐ people resisted for three months. **Yì** (益) praised Yǔ and led his troops to victory. With the **Gānyú** (干羽, ritual dance) performed, the Mǎoyǐ submitted.

Lǎozi said: *"In warfare, there are words: I do not dare to be the aggressor but only the responder, not to advance an inch but to retreat a foot."* Yǔ’s conduct in war can be called the teacher of a true King.

Yet without Yǔ’s oath beforehand, how could there be Tāng’s oaths of **Tài** (泰) and **Yì** (誓) afterward? Was it not the case that the first to create the model would have no successors?

This is another lesson for those who come before.

Yǔ entrusted **Gāoyáo** (皋陶) and **Bóyì** (伯益) to assist in his governance, raised six armies to subdue the unruly, and the Four Extremes dared not defy him. His influence extended east to the sea, west to the flowing sands, north to the distant lands, and south to the realm where his teachings reached all four seas.

He ruled for seventeen years as regent and ten years as king, totaling twenty-seven years. In the year *guǐwèi* (癸未), he died during an eastern inspection at **Kuàijī** (會稽), having lived a hundred years. He passed the Mandate to his son Qǐ.

Xia had seventeen kings, ruling for a total of four hundred and fifty-eight years, until Jié was exiled and Xia perished.

**Shang Tāng**—in the year *jiāzi* **甲**, the first month *wǔ* (午), the 7th day; the star *yǐ* (乙), the 182nd; the celestial stem *mǎo* (卯), the 2176th—bore the surname **Zǐ** (子), was named **Lǚ** (履), and had the courtesy name **Tiānyǐ** (天乙). He was the fourteenth descendant of **Yǔ’s Minister of Works, Xì** (契). For seventeen years, he was among the feudal lords, then overthrew Jié and ascended to the throne. He began in the year *yǐwèi* (乙未) and, in the second year *jiāzi* **甲**, ruled with the virtue of Water, established *chǒu* (丑) as the correct orientation, and established his capital at **Mó** (亳), hence the name **Chéng Tāng** (成汤).

He obtained **Yīyǐn** (伊尹) in the **Shēnyě** (莘野) wilderness. Because **Gébó** (葛伯) did not perform sacrifices, Tāng began his conquests among the feudal lords, starting with the campaign against Bo. Jié, with his lost virtue, plunged the people into suffering. Tāng recommended **Yīyǐn** to Xia, who was rejected five times but finally accepted in the year *jiāzi* **甲**, when he returned to **Mó** (亳). Tāng lacked the proper tribute, and Jié raised an army to punish him, but the **Jiǔyí** (九夷) forces did not arrive.

**Yīyǐn** said: *"It is sufficient."* Then he served as Tāng’s advisor in the attack against Jié, swore to the assembled troops, and fought at **Míngtiáo** (鸣条). Jié was exiled to **Náncháo** (南巢), and all under Heaven submitted to Tāng.

Tāng had a sense of humility in his virtue, so the *Páng Míng* (盤銘) inscription reads: *"Virtue renews itself daily, daily renews itself, and yet again renews itself."* He ruled for thirteen years and lived a hundred years.

By the time **Pángēng** (盘庚) reached his twenty-first year, the year *gēngshēn* (庚申), Lǎozi, riding the *jīng* (精, "pure") *jiāzi* **甲**, descended to **Mó** (亳), entrusting his pregnancy to **Yǐnshì** (尹氏) and the **Xuányàoyù** (玄妙玉) maiden. In the twenty-fourth year of **Wǔdīng** (武丁), the year *gēngchén* (庚辰), on the fifteenth day of the second month, he was born in the **Lǐxià** (李下) village.

The **Lǐ** clan was taken as his surname.

**Emperor Xīn** (Jié) was licentious and brutal, so **Bǐgān** (比干) died for his remonstrance, **Wéizǐ** (微子) was imprisoned, **Jīzǐ** (箕子) enslaved, and **Féngméng** (逢蒙) executed. **Xībó** (西伯) subdued the **Lí** (黎), and **Zǔ Yǐ** (祖伊) feared him, composing *"Subduing the Lí"* (戡黎).

Jié then declared: *"My life does not have its fate in Heaven, nor does my folly heed remonstrance."* The **Dào** (周武王) attacked him, but his forces were defeated and he fled to the **Lútái** (鹿台). Clad in his precious jade, he threw himself into the flames and died.

The **Lǎozi** (老子) said: *"The highest sage is unknown to the people below. Next, he is loved and praised by them. Then, he is feared and finally, he is reviled."*

Alas, Jié was indeed not in the **Dao/Way** (道), yet **Shāng Tāng** (成汤) exiled him. Jié was indeed not in the **Dao/Way** (道), yet **Wǔwáng** (武王) attacked him. Was he not one who was feared by them?

The **Shāng** (商) dynasty had thirty rulers, lasting six hundred and forty-four years, before its demise and submission to the **Zhōu** (周).

**Wǔwáng** (周武王), surnamed **Jī** (姬), born in the year *jiāyǔ* (甲午) on the seventh day of the first month, under the star **Dīng** (丁), in the hour of the **Chén** (辰), at the age of two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven, was the son of **Chāng** (昌), the child of **Yáo** (尧) and **Nóngshī** (农师) **Hòujì** (后稷) **Qì** (弃). **Chāng** served Jié, alongside the **Jiǔhòu** (九侯) and **Èhòu** (鄂侯), as one of the **Sāngōng** (三公). After being secretly imprisoned in **Yǔlǐ** (羑里) for seven years, he later offered land and was granted **gōngshì** (弓矢斧钺), through which he gained control over military campaigns as **Xībó** (西伯).

In the twenty-fourth year of Jié’s reign, **Wénwáng** (文王) passed away. Nine years later, **Wǔwáng** (武王), with **Tàigōng Wàng** (太公望) as his teacher and **Zhōugōng Dàn** (周公旦) as his assistant, overthrew the **Yīn** (殷) and assumed the **Mandate of Heaven** (受命). Returning to **Fēng** (丰) and ascending the throne, he faced the feudal lords to the south. On the day *jǐmǎo* (己卯), in the year *chénzǐ* (辰之子) plus six years, with the virtue of **Wood** (木德), he established **Zǐ** (子) as the primary month.

He reversed the **Shāng** (商) policies, released **Jīzǐ** (箕子) from captivity, honored **Bǐgān** (比干)’s grave, and examined the **Yīn** (殷) customs. He dispersed the wealth of the **Lútái** (鹿台), opened the granaries of **Jùqiáo** (巨桥), and imposed heavy taxes on the seas. The myriad peoples submitted joyfully. He established five ranks of nobility, divided the lands into three, appointed officials only for their virtue, and assigned duties based on ability. He valued the people with five teachings, regulated **sāngjiè** (丧祭, mourning and sacrifices) through food, and emphasized sincerity, clarity of justice, and reverence for virtue while rewarding merit. Under his rule, the realm was governed with ease.

I have often sighed and said: *"The **Tāng** (唐) had four tyrants (四凑), and the one who punished them was **Shùn** (舜). The **Yú** (虞) had the **Sānmíáo** (三苗), and the one who conquered them was **Yǔ** (禹). In **Xià** (夏), Tāng’s conquest began in **Gě** (葛). In **Shāng** (商), **Xībó** (西伯) subdued the **Lí** (黎). All who gained the Mandate of Heaven in ancient times, whether through humility or force, rarely lacked their own influence before the conquest. Was it Heaven’s will, or did human circumstances compel it?"*

Wǔwáng ruled for six years, living to ninety-three. A century and twenty-one years later, **Zhāowáng** (昭王) did not return from his southern expedition. Seventeen years later, **Yīwáng** (夷王) received feudal lords in the **hall** (堂). Fifty-three years later, **Lìwáng** (厉王) fled to **Zhì** (彘), and the **Zhōu** (周) and **Shào** (召) lords governed for fourteen years under the title **"Gònghé"** (共和). Lìwáng died in **Zhì** (彘). The two lords then installed **Tàizǐ Jìng** (太子静) as **Xuānwáng** (宣王).

**Zhòngshānfǔ** (仲山甫), **Yǐn Jǐfǔ** (尹吉甫), and **Fāngshū** (方叔) joined **Zhōu** (周) and **Shào** (召) as the **Wǔbó** (五伯), assisting Xuānwáng and restoring the achievements of **Wén** (文) and **Wǔ** (武).

Fifty-seven years later, **Yōuwáng** (幽王) was killed by **Shēnhòu** (申侯), and **Píngwáng** (平王) relocated eastward to **Luòyīng** (洛邑), establishing the **East Zhōu** (东周) era. He bestowed the title of feudal lord upon **Jìn Wén Hóu** (晋文侯) and **Qín Xiānggōng** (秦襄公).

Sixty-four years later, **Huánwáng** (桓王) led armies from **Cài** (蔡), **Wèi** (卫), and **Chén** (陈) against **Zhèng** (郑), which defended him with forces on both flanks. An arrow struck the king in the shoulder. Forty years later, **Huìwáng** (惠王) conferred the title of feudal lord upon **Qí Huángōng** (齐桓公).

Thirty years later, **Xiāngwáng** (襄王) deposed the **Dí** (狄) queen, and the **Dí** armies attacked the **Zhōu** (周). The king fled to **Zhèng** (郑), where he was sheltered by **Chú Dài** (叔带). The following year, he sent an urgent plea to **Jìn** (晋), and **Jìn Wén Gōng** (晋文公) restored him to the throne while executing Chú Dài. He granted **Jìn Wén Gōng** lands and the title of feudal lord.

From then on, the **Five Hegemons** (五伯)—**Qí** (齐), **Jìn** (晋), **Qín** (秦), **Chǔ** (楚), and **Sòng** (宋)—grew ever stronger while the royal house declined.

Fifty-five years later, in the year *gēngxū* (庚戌), **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) was born. Seventy-eight years later, **Xiàowáng** (孝王) passed away. The **Xiào** (孝) and **Kǎo** (考) titles were exchanged in their ancestral records, and **Wèilièwáng** (威烈王) ascended the throne.

**Hé'nán Huìgōng** (河南惠公), the youngest son, was granted the title of **East Zhōu** (东周) lord at **Gǒng** (巩). Another account says that **Xiàowáng** (孝王) restored the name **West Zhōu** (西周) and granted his brother **Huángōng** (桓公) the lands of **Hé'nán** (河南). Seven years later, **East Zhōu** (东周) was established, and the **Zhōu** (周) dynasty was divided into two. Fifty-eight years later, in the year *jiāyín* (甲寅), **Zhào** (赵) and **Hán** (韩) split the **Zhōu** (周) lands further.

Seven years later, in the year *xīnyǒu* (辛酉), **East Zhōu** (东周) was firmly established. Thirty-one years later, in the year *yǐyǒu* (乙酉), **Mèngzǐ** (孟轲) served as an official in **Wèi** (魏).

Twenty-nine years later, in the year *jiāyín* (甲寅), **Nǐngwáng** (赧王) reigned, and the lords of **East Zhōu** (东周) and **West Zhōu** (西周) fought each other. Fifty-one years later, in the year *yǐsì* (乙巳), **Nǐngwáng** (赧王) gathered armies from **Qí** (齐), **Hán** (韩), **Zhào** (赵), and **Wèi** (魏) to attack **Qín** (秦), but they were defeated. He fled westward to **Qín** (秦), surrendering all his territories, then returned to **Zhōu** (周) and died.

The **Zhōu** (周) dynasty had thirty-six rulers, lasting eight hundred and sixty-seven years. Six years later, the **East Zhōu** (东周) lord gathered feudal armies to attack **Qín** (秦), but they were defeated. He was captured and died in **Qín** (秦), and all his lands were annexed.

In total, these three dynasties ruled for one thousand nine hundred and sixty-nine years. The **Huan** (桓) and **Wen** (文) Hegemons emerged over a thousand five hundred years later.

Examining the **Three Dynasties** (三代), Tāng and Wǔwáng already ascended from feudal lords to kings, thus they did not await the rise of the **Huan** (桓) and **Wen** (文) Hegemons before becoming rulers. Moreover, the **Hegemons Kūnwú** (昆吾) of **Xià** (夏), **Dàpēng** (大彭) of **Shāng** (商), and **Shǐwéi** (豕韦) were already recorded in the **Two Dynasties** (二代).

After **Xiāngwáng** (襄王), the **Hegemons Kūnwú** (昆吾), **Dàpēng** (大彭), and **Shǐwéi** (豕韦) were gone, and **Qín** (秦), **Sòng** (宋), and **Chǔ** (楚) became the **Five Hegemons** (五伯) of **Zhōu** (周).

The **Six Conferences** (六会) spanned six thousand four hundred and eighty years. Excluding the **Kāiwù** (开物) era and **Pángǔ** (盘古), the **Four Conferences** (四会) totaled four thousand three hundred and twenty years.

From the **Tiānhuángshì** (天皇氏) who first emerged, the earliest humans established their customs. From **Tiānhuángshì** (天皇氏) to **Dàyǔ** (大禹), it took seven years—spanning two thousand one hundred and sixty years in total.

The **Sovereigns** descending from **Xiānhào** (少昊) who were called *Huáng* (皇) numbered five, spanning eleven full ages and two-thirds of another—thus, the era of those called *Huáng* lasted **21,250 years**, while those called *Dì* (帝) amounted to only **350 years**. How could the *Dì*’s reign be so brief while the *Huáng*’s endure so long? No, that is not so.

**Shénnóng** (神农) was already called the **Flame Emperor** (炎帝), and thereafter, eight successive *Dì* ruled under the **Arca Constellation** (帝临魁), all bearing the title *Dì*. **Xuānyuán** (轩辕) was also called *Dì*. Examining this, we see that after the **Three Sovereigns** (三皇), the titles *Huáng* and *Dì* appeared alternately, intertwined within **1,933 years**.

The **Three Kings** (三王), beginning with **Xià Dīngsì** (夏丁巳), endured nearly **1,454 years**, until **Píngwáng** (平王) relocated eastward, and governance devolved to the **Regional Hegemons** (方伯). Thus, the rise of the **Five Hegemons** (五伯) originated with **Zhāowáng** (昭王), developed under **Yíwáng** (夷王), manifested in **Píngwáng**’s reign, and culminated in the eras of **Lí** (厘) and **Huì** (惠), leaving **Zhōu** (周) as an empty ceremonial state.

Tracing this logic, is it not evident that the *Huáng* is approachable, the *Dì* is praiseworthy, the *Wáng* (王) is formidable, and the *Bó* (伯) is contemptible?

Now, considering the four ranks—*Huáng*, *Dì*, *Wáng*, and *Bó*—**Yǔ** (禹) ascended the throne in his eighth year, marking the midpoint of a **Great Cycle** (*yīyuán* 一元). Above, they were called *Huáng* or *Dì*; below, they were called *Wáng* or *Bó*.

Speaking of the **Six Conferences** (六会), the four conferences before *Kāiwù* (开物) included half a *Wáng-Bó* division, and the two remaining conferences had an odd portion, totaling **24,355 years**. The **Three Kings** spanned only **1,969 years**, yet the *Bó* titles already intermingled within them. How could these be true *Bó*?

Indeed, there exist the *Huáng* of *Wáng*, the *Dì* of *Wáng*, the *Wáng* of *Wáng*, and the *Bó* of *Wáng*. And further, there are the *Huáng* of the *Huáng* of *Wáng*, the *Dì* of the *Huáng* of *Wáng*, and the *Bó* of the *Wáng* of *Wáng*—like the **Four Seasons** (四时) shifting in their *qi* (气), sometimes advancing, sometimes receding, not bound by a single rule.

The *Yì* (易) says: *"He who knows the Dao of transformation knows the workings of the Divine."*

As for my earlier discussion of the **four principles**—*lǐ* (理), *qì* (气), *xiàng* (象), and *shù* (数)—where there is *lǐ*, there is *qì*; where there is *qì*, there is *xiàng*; where there is *xiàng*, there is *shù*.

A **Great Cycle** (*yīyuán* 一元) of twelve conferences corresponds to a year’s twelve months. A conference of thirty *yùn* (运) corresponds to a month’s thirty days. A *yùn* of twelve ages (*shì* 世) corresponds to a day’s twelve *shí* (时). An age of thirty years corresponds to a *shí*’s thirty *fēn* (分).

Thus, one age of thirty years yields **129,600 *fēn***. One *yùn* of twelve ages yields **129,600 days**. One conference of thirty *yùn* yields **129,600 months**. A Great Cycle of twelve conferences yields **129,600 years**. This is the general outline—I merely sketch a few points, not claiming mastery, but aspiring to learn.

Moreover, regarding **Shào Zǐ** (邵子)’s writings, his discourse on *Dàodé* (道德) and *gōnglì* (功力) elucidates the distinctions of *Huáng*, *Dì*, *Wáng*, and *Bó*—his meaning I have privately adopted.

As for observing phenomena (*guānwù* 观物), divining through *guà* (卦), *qì* (气), and *yīnlǜ* (音律), there is already the *Huángjī Jīngshì Shū* (皇极经世书) for that.

The **Teachings of the Daoist School** for later generations—**Du Dàojiān** (杜道坚) of **Cùchū** (当涂) has annotated this.

In the **Chapter of Birth** (降生章), **Lǎozǐ** (老子) says:
*"I do not know whose son I am; I precede the **Xiàngdì** (象帝)."*

According to the *Jì* (纪) and *Zhuàn* (传), **Lǎozǐ** is the **ancestor of the Great Dao** (大道之祖), and his **qi** (气) precedes **Xiàngdì** (象帝)—the **Heavenly Sovereign** (天). Thus, it is said:
*"Before Heaven I was born, born yet formless.
After Heaven I exist, existing yet without substance.
Only because I am formless and without substance,
do I have no fixed name.
Only because I have no fixed name,
do I appear and vanish without measure.
Perhaps this refers to **Hùndùnshì** (混沌氏)?"*

In Heaven, he is called:
**Xūhuáng Tiānzūn** (虚皇天尊),
**Wújí Dàodé Jūn** (无极大道君),
**Tiānhuáng Yàopò Bǎogāo** (天皇曜魄宝高上),
**Lǎozǐ Tiānhuáng Dàdì** (老子天皇大帝),
**Jiǔtiān Shànghuáng Dòngzhēn Dì** (九天上皇洞真帝),
**Yījūn** (一君),
**Tàiqīng Tiānzūn** (太清天尊),
**Tàishàng Xuányuán Lǎojūn** (太上玄元老君),
**Jīnquè Hòushèng Jūn** (金阙后圣君),
**Jiǔlǎo Xiāndū Jūn** (九老仙都君),
**Tàishàng Zhàngrén Jìnglǎo Tiānzūn** (太上丈人静老天君),
and **Zhēnyuán Jiàozhǔ Jīnquè Dìjūn** (真元教主金阙帝君).

When he descends into the world, he is called:
**Tōngxuán Tiānshī** (通玄天师),
**Pángǔ Xiānshēng** (盘古先生),
**Yǒugǔ Dà Xiānshēng** (有古大先生),
**Xuánzhōng Dà Fǎshī** (玄中大法师),
**Yùhuá Zǐ** (郁华子),
**Guǎngshòu Zǐ** (广寿子),
**Dàchéng Zǐ** (大成子),
**Guǎngchéng Zǐ** (广成子),
**Suìyìng Zǐ** (随应子),
**Chìjīng Zǐ** (赤精子),
**Lùtú Zǐ** (录图子),
**Wùchéng Zǐ** (务成子),
**Yǐnshòu Zǐ** (尹寿子),
and **Zhēnxíng Zǐ** (真行子).

Is this not the **Lǎozǐ** (老子) who is said to be the **Master of Ten Thousand Phenomena** (万象主) and the **Teacher of the Sovereign** (帝者师), whose titles vary without end?

As for the names **Xuányuán Huángdì** (玄元皇帝),
**Dàodé Xuányuán Huángdì** (大道玄元皇帝),
**Tàishàng Hùnyuán Tiānhuáng Dàdì** (太上混元天皇大帝),
**Gāoshàng Dàodé Jīnquè Xuányuán Tiānhuáng Dàdì** (高上大道金阙玄元天皇大帝),
and **Tàishàng Lǎojūn Hùnyuán Shàngdé Huángdì** (太上老君混元上德皇帝),
these are the **imperial titles conferred** (册封之号) upon him by successive dynasties.

*"Hidden in the **Tàiwú** (太无), manifesting in the **Tàichū** (太初), wandering in the **Tàixū** (太虚), giving birth to Heaven and Earth, governing gods and ghosts, and the **Sovereign of the Divine** (神帝),—since antiquity, before Heaven and Earth existed, he has ever endured. Is this not referring to **Lǎojūn** (老君)?"*

A humble **disciple of Lǎozǐ** (老子徒), I dare to cite and expand upon this.

According to the *Běn Jì* (本纪), **Lǎozǐ** (老子) was of the **Lǐ** (李) surname, given name **Ěr** (耳), courtesy name **Bóyáng** (伯阳), and posthumous title **Dān** (聃).

From **Lìyù Xiāngqǔ** (亳苦县濑), also written as **Lìxiāng Qǔrénlǐ** (厉乡曲仁里), a daughter of the **Yǐn** (尹) family conceived through the **sacred light of the sun** (日精) and gave birth to him in the **24th year of Shāng Wǔdīng** (商武丁), on the **15th day of the second month**, **Gēngchén** (庚辰).

The **Shāng** (商) dynasty took **chǒu** (丑) as the beginning of the year, and the second month began with **yín** (寅), corresponding to the **first month’s *Yuánxiāo Jié* (上元节)** in today’s reckoning.

He was born able to speak, pointing to **Lǐ** (李) as his surname, and because of his **white-haired head** (皓首), he was called **Lǎozǐ** (老子).

His **auspicious omens at birth** (祯祥) are fully recorded in the *Jì* (纪) and *Zhuàn* (传).

Now, in **Lìyù** (亳), the **Tàiqīng Palace** (太清宫), the **Jiǔlóng Jǐng** (九龙井), and the **Báilù Huì** (白鹿桧)—**sacred traces** (圣迹) remain.

The **Di Xīn** (帝辛) of the **Shāng** (商) in his twenty-first year, **Dīngmǎo** (丁卯), cleared the ground at **Qíshān** (岐山). The **West伯 of Zhōu** (周西伯) summoned and appointed him as **Guardian of the Hidden Archives** (守藏史). When **Wǔ Wáng** (武王) relocated him to **Zhùxià Shǐ** (柱下史), **Chéng Wáng** (成王) retained him in the same post. At the beginning of **Zhāo Wáng’s** (昭王) reign, he resigned and returned to **Bì** (亳).

In the twenty-sixth year, **Guǐchǒu** (癸丑), he crossed the **Hángǔ Pass** (函谷关) and, at **Zhōngnán Shān** (终南山), taught **Jiān Yǐn Xī** (关尹喜) the *Dàodé* (道德) in two scrolls within a thatched pavilion. He then departed through **Dàsàn Guān** (大散关), meeting Jiān Yǐn Xī at **Qīngyáng Sì** (青羊肆) in **Chéngdū** (成都) before journeying westward with him.

When **Mù Wáng** (穆王) returned from his western hunt to **Zhōu** (周), he was deeply moved by the **mysterious Dao** (玄风), ascending **Zhōngnán Shān** to restore the thatched pavilion, renaming it **Lóuguān** (楼观). He commissioned the **recluses Yǐn Guǐ** (尹轨), **Dù Chōng** (杜冲), and others to tend the shrine, numbering seven **Daoists** (道士) among them.

Later, **Lǎozǐ** (老子) returned eastward, passing through **Lóuguān**, where he transmitted the *Dàodé Zǐxū Yángguāng Jīngjù* (道德紫虚阳光经箓) to **Yǐn Guǐ, Dù Chōng, and Sòng Lún** (宋伦).

**Yóu Wáng** (幽王) summoned him to the post of **Grand Historian** (太史). In the third year, **Xīnyǒu** (辛酉), he warned the king of tremors in the **Three Rivers** (三川), foretelling the fall of **Zhōu** (周), and then vanished.

In the thirty-fourth year of **Píng Wáng’s** (平王) reign, **Guǐmǎo** (癸卯), he re-emerged through **Dàsàn Guān**, remaining in the central lands for some time before returning.

**Jìng Wáng** (敬王) appointed him **Keeper of the Hidden Archives** (藏室史) for eighteen years.

When **Kǒngzǐ** (孔子) arrived in **Zhōu** with **Nángōng Jìngshū** (南宫敬叔) to inquire about rites, **Yìliè Wáng** (夷烈王) in his second year granted him an audience. Passing through **Qín**, **Xiàn Gōng** (献公) of **Qín** hosted him with honors and consulted him on **astronomy and numerology** (历数).

In the ninth year of **Yǎn Wáng’s** (赧王) reign, **Lǎozǐ** traveled to **Rǔjǐ** (女几) in **Fèitiān Zhù** (肺天柱), from which point he again departed through **Dàsàn Guān**, crossing the **flowing sands** (流沙) and ascending **Kūnlún** (昆仑) in the west.

He lived **174 years** in the **Shāng** (商) and **822 years** in the **Zhōu** (周), wandering the world, aiding the age, and spanning **996 years** of human history. Yet those who view him only through the **Shāng** and **Zhōu** fail to grasp the **Tàishàng Lǎozǐ** (太上之老子). Those who perceive him merely as a figure of the human world—how could they comprehend the **Xiāntiān Lǎozǐ** (先天之老子)?

Thus the *Jīng* (经) states:
*"Independent yet unchanging, revolving yet unexhausted.*
*To wield the ancient Dao in governing the present—*
*Is this not the Master’s own self-expression?"*

As for the **Qín-Hàn** (秦汉) onward, down to the **Táng-Sòng** (唐宋), his **manifestations and transformations** (应身降现) were boundless—common folk could not recognize them. The *Běnjì* (本纪) and *Shílù* (实录) attest to this.

**Eight Chapters on Transmission:**
**Jiān Yǐnzǐ** (关尹子), surnamed **Yǐn** (尹), named **Xǐ** (喜), served **Zhāo Wáng** (昭王) as a **Great Official** (大夫). Skilled in **celestial omens** (天文), he foresaw that **true qi** (真气) from the southeast would manifest like a **dragon-serpent**, while the west would experience **threefold winds** (三扇) dispersing **heavenly order** (天理) westward. Knowing a **sage** (圣人) would cross the pass, he begged to be appointed **Orderly of Hángǔ Pass** (函谷关令).

In the fifth month, **Guǐchǒu** (癸丑), **Rénwǔ** (壬午), **purple vapors** (紫气) filled the sky. An **old man** (老人) drove a **green ox and white oxcart** (青牛白畚车), with disciples riding as outriders, **Xū Jiǎ** (徐甲) as charioteer, preparing to cross the pass. Jiān Yǐn Xī knelt in welcome, and it was **Lǎozǐ** (老子).

Jiān Yǐn Xī said, *"The Great Dao is about to vanish—strongly urge him to record it!"* Thus, he lodged at the **thatched pavilion of Zhōngnán** (终南草楼) and became his disciple.

The following year, **Jiǎyín** (甲寅), **Lǎozǐ** transmitted the *Dàodé* (道德) in **over five thousand words**, encompassing **heaven and earth**, harmonizing with **mysterious transformation** (造化), and exhaustively encompassing **sovereigns, ministers, people, and things**. He exalted **Dao and virtue** (道德) above **benevolence and righteousness** (仁义), thereby elevating the **Emperor** above petty **kings and lords** (王伯).

Fundamentally, he clarified the **Dao of Heaven** (天道) and the **Dao of Humanity** (人道), rectifying the **sovereign’s heart** (君心) and the **people’s heart** (民心). He declared:
*"Govern with rectitude, employ the extraordinary in warfare."*
*"The Left General commands the left, the Upper General commands the right."*

In several chapters, his teachings resemble the **praise and censure of the Five Hegemons** (五伯). Scholars doubt whether **Zhāo Wáng** had yet established hegemony, or if the transmission occurred in **Jìng Wáng’s** (敬王) time—yet they fail to recognize that **Kūnú** (昆吾), **Dà Péng** (大彭), and **Shǐ Wéi** (豕韦) already styled themselves **Hegemons** in the decline of **Xià** and **Shāng**. Observing **Zhāo Wáng’s** failure to return from the **Jiāng** (江), it was clear that even without the rise of **Qí, Chǔ, Qín, and Jìn**, the **spirit of hegemony** had already emerged. This is why the **sage’s** *Dàodé* (道德) integrates **both efficacy and principle**.

Examining the **Buckenham’s Star** (乾象河鼓三星), which governs the **three armies of the Son of Heaven**, the **central star** is the **Great General** (大将军), the **left star** the **Left General** (左将军), and the **right star** the **Right General** (右将军). The **Summer Officials** (夏官) record the **Upper Grand Marshal** (上大司马) commanding **five armies**, with **greater states** fielding **three armies**, as seen in the *Zhōu Lǐ* (周礼). The *Mù Wáng Nèi Zhuàn* (穆王内传) further states that when the king returned from his western expedition and ascended **Zhōngnán Shān**, restoring the thatched pavilion, it confirms the transmission occurred in **Zhāo Wáng’s** time.

Jiān Yǐn Xī himself authored **nine chapters**, titled *Guān Yǐnzǐ* (关尹子). Later, his disciple **Jìn Gōngsūn Xīn Jié** (晋公孙辛钘)—recorded as **Yán** (研) in the *Wú Yuè Chūnqiū* (吴越春秋)—studied under **Lǎozǐ**. In the second year of **Jìng Wáng’s** (敬王) reign, **Yán** traveled south, where **Píng Wáng** of **Chǔ** (楚平王) honored him with an audience and sought his teachings.

Later, he journeyed to **Yuè** (越), where **Fàn Lǐ** (范蠡) became his disciple. **Lǎozǐ** gave him **twelve chapters**, titled *Wénzǐ* (文子), including a section on **Píng Wáng’s** (平王) inquiry. **Gōujīàn** (勾践) elevated him to the rank of **Great Official** (大夫).

When **Yuè** attacked **Wú** (吴), **Fàn Lǐ** counseled:
*"War is a cruel instrument. Battle defies virtue. Secret plots defy virtue; favoring cruel tools—heaven forbids it. This course will not prosper."*
He cited the *Wénzǐ* (文子).

**Gōujīàn** refused, suffering defeat at **Fú Jiāo** (夫椒), imprisonment in the **Stone Chamber** (石室), and only returned after bribing the **Grand Steward Fú Pì** (太宰嚭).

After his defeat, **Gōujīàn** vowed vengeance and drank bitter herbs to steel his resolve. When he was confined in the marshes, **Jì Rán** said:
*"Gōujīàn has a long neck and a hawk’s beak—he may endure hardship with you, but he cannot share in peace."*

**Fàn Lǐ** followed this counsel, fleeing to the **Five Lakes**. **Jì Rán**, too, feigned madness and fled, taking refuge in **Fēngyú**, where he climbed mountains to devise strategies. This is the origin of the **Mountain Plans** now attributed to **Wú**.

**Liè Yùkòu** dwelled in **Jǐng’s** fields for forty years, yet no one recognized him. In the fourth year of **Ān Wáng’s** reign, he composed eight chapters, elucidating **Lǎozǐ’s** **Dao**.

**Zhuāng Zhōu**, styled **Zǐxiū** and surnamed **Nánhúazǐ**, in the thirty-third year of **Xiǎn Wáng’s** reign, was invited by **Chǔ** to serve as chancellor, but he declined. Instead, he secluded himself in the **Lacquer Garden** by the **Hú River**, compiling fifty-three chapters titled *Zhuāngzǐ*. Thirty-three remain today.

As for **Gēngsāng Chǔ**, **Nánhóng Qù**, **Cuī Qú**, **Mòjǔ**, **Shìchéng Qǐ**, and **Yín Wénzǐ**—all were disciples of **Lǎozǐ** in their time, transmitting his **Dao** and leaving their own writings recorded in the classics. Yet **Lǎozǐ** himself had long traversed **Shāng** and **Zhōu**. Those who saw him in person, like **Kǒngzǐ**, were few indeed.

Since **Sīmǎ Qiān** grouped **Lǎozǐ** and **Hàn Fēi** in a single biography, the records of **Lǎozǐ’s** disciples were lost, causing the **Dao** of **Kǒng** and **Lǎo**—once intertwined—to vanish without transmission in later ages. Alas.

This is the **"Western Journey" chapter**.

The **Venerable Sage of Lao** in his later years crossed the shifting sands and ascended to the **Kūnlún Mountains**, returning to the **Zǐwēi Palace** above, thus demonstrating his final departure. For what ends is what begins—like the four seasons in their cyclical succession.

Hence it is said:
*"When one’s deeds are complete and one’s name established, to withdraw is the Way of Heaven."*
*"To complete one’s deeds without claiming them ensures one’s name endures."*
*"To never lose one’s place is to endure; to die without perishing is to attain true longevity."*

Thus, the **Sage observes the Way of Heaven**, follows **Heaven’s course**, and in retreat and advance aligns with the **Creator’s boundless work**. The **Kūnlún Mountains** lie in the northwest of the earth, towering over ten thousand *lǐ*, vast in breadth. They reach toward the **Bìluò** (Celestial Vault), where the **Lí** people dwell. Hence, **Xīhuáng’s** **Gèn** and **Wénwáng’s** **Qián** both occupy the northwest.

As the **Kūnlún** is to the earth, so the **Yuánshǒu** is to man. The heavens rise highest in the northwest, where the **Heavenly Gate** stands. Its nine peaks pierce the nine heavens, where the **Most High** and the gathered **True Ones** ascend in revelry. There, **jewel-pine trees** and **jade flowers**, **qi-hua** and **yáo-grass**, seven-treasured forests sway in the **Heavenly Wind**, their **línláng** chimes resounding in perfect harmony—an uncarved realm of **Yù** (jade) and **Hún** (primordial sound).

The **Kūnlún** is the **Central Peak of Heaven**, situated between the northern seas, directly beneath the **Heavenly Heart**, shaped like an inverted canopy—broad at the top, narrow below, tiered in three layers, its summit touching the heavens. There, the **Yellow and Red Paths** of the sun and moon converge, and the **Three Luminaries** traverse. To the east lies **Kūnlún**, to the west **Xuánpǔ**, to the north **Yuèyuàn**, and to the south, the **Jīshí Mountains**, the **Zhènshuǐ Springs**, and the **Běihù Mountains** connect. Above stand the **Five Golden Platforms** and **Twelve Jade Pavilions**, encircled by a **Thousand-*lǐ* Golden City**.

There grow **golden-rooted trees**, **jade-branched forests**, **purple phoenixes**, **emerald cranes**, **azure peaches**, and **white plums** in abundance. The **Mìoyán**—the **Yellow Emperor’s Celestial Sovereign**—holds the **pivot and lock**, governing this mountain and linking it to the **Five Sacred Peaks**. Divine beings and immortals traverse it ceaselessly.

Examining the **registers of birth**, the **Upper Sovereign** resides here, the essence of the **Filling Stars**, dwelling within the **Central-*yī* Qi of Heaven**.

The **Five Peaks beyond the seas** are the **Five Pillars of Heaven and Earth**, the **Five Origins of the Five Qi**. The **Venerable Sage’s** ascent to **Kūnlún**—was it not a return to the **Wújí** (Non-Extreme)?

For **Kūnlún** is the dwelling of **Original Qi** and the realm of the **Celestial Sovereign**. In ancient times, **kings, rulers, marshals, and great ministers** who achieved great deeds and virtue, as well as **high men and virtuous scholars** with profound **Dao** and wondrous conduct, all ascended there. How could those who defy **Heaven’s Way** or stray from **Heaven’s course** ever hope to reach it?

Yet it is said that **immortals** are but **transferred**. Those who cultivate the **Dao**, like the **Three Teachings of the Han**—**Máojūn**, **Zhāng Fǔhàn**—or the **Jìn** scholars **Xǔ Jīngyáng** and **Gě Xiāngōng**, first ascended to the **Sacred Mountains**, then to the **Ten Isles and Three Expanse-Islands**, and finally to **Kūnlún** as **Supreme Celestial Officials**. Not only could they be counted among **Laozi’s** disciples, but they could be counted among **Heaven’s** disciples as well.

As the *Huáinánzǐ* states:
*"Yú dug into the **Kūnlún’s** foundations, revealing a nine-tiered palace a hundred thousand *lǐ* high. There grew **grain-trees** five *zhèn* tall, **pearl-trees**, **jade-trees**, **encircling-trees**, and **trees of immortality** to the west; **sand-peach** and **lángyáng** to the east; **crimson-trees** to the south; and **emerald-trees** and **yáo-trees** to the north. Four hundred forty gates flanked it, four *lǐ* between each gate, nine *chún* between each interval. Nine wells stood beside them, with **jade** lodged in the northwest corner. The northern gate opened to the **Bùzhōu Wind**, causing the **rotating halls** to sway, the **suspended orchards** to cool, and the **fān-tóng** to flourish within the **Kūnlún’s** gates—its **sparse gardens**. The gardens’ pools were filled with **Yellow Water**, which circled three times before returning to its source, called **Dan Water**; drinking it grants immortality.

The **River** issued from the **Kūnlún’s** northeast corner, flowing through the **Bóhǎi** into the **Jīshí Mountains** where **Yú** channeled it. The **Red Water** emerged from its southeast corner, flowing southwest into the **Southern Sea**. To the east of **Dānzé**, from the **Weak Water’s** source at **Qióngshí**, it reached **Hélí**, its excess spilling into the **Flowing Sands** and south to the **Southern Sea**. The **Yáng Water** issued from its northwest corner, entering the **Southern Sea** south of **Yǔmín**.

These four waters are the **Divine Springs of the Emperor**, blending all medicines and nourishing all things.

The **Kūnlún Hills**—some say double its height—are called the **Mountain of Cool Winds**, ascending which grants immortality. Others say double again, calling it **Xuánpǔ**, ascending which grants **spiritual potency**, enabling mastery over wind and rain. Doubling once more, it becomes **Shàngtiān** (Upper Heaven), ascending which grants **divinity**—the abode of the **Tàidì** (Great Sovereign).

**Original Title: Chapter Ten**

The *Dàodéjīng* was recorded by **Guān Lìng**, **Yǐnxí**, at the behest of the **Venerable Sage**. The **Sage’s** words encompass the **Way of Non-Beginning and Beginning**, the **Opening of Heaven and Establishment of the Pole**, the **Royal Dao of the Highest Antiquity**, the **Imperial Virtue of the Ancient Age**, down to the **kings’ deeds** and the **lords’ might—over five thousand characters**, encompassing the **Dao of Heaven and Man**, spanning thousands of generations, clearly traceable.

The **Sage** is spoken of in thirty-two instances without a name—perhaps the **Nameless Ancient Historian**. It serves as a **mirror for ten thousand ages**, a **framework for human perfection**, and a **path to enter the Sacred Realm**.

The **Venerable Sage** compiled the *Dàodéjīng* from **Ancient Histories**, just as the **Sage Kǒng** composed the *Chūnqiū* from **Lǔ Histories**—one in essence. Yet it is not called a *History* but the *Dàodéjīng*, for it follows the **trigram cycles**, as the **Outer Historians** of the **Zhōu Officials** recorded the **annals of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors**.

The *Sān Fén* having vanished and the *Wǔ Diǎn* incomplete, yet fortunately this *Jīng* remains, preserving the Ancient Way from decay.

The Venerable Sage’s intent was earnest: to proclaim the **Imperial Dao** and **Sovereign Virtue** as the true counsel for the age. With kings and lords arising in competition, their deeds and might vying, he feared their ultimate ruin and the people’s helplessness. Thus, he sought to restore fragmentation into wholeness, to return corruption to purity—even if he could not make the people into the **Nine Sovereigns’ subjects**, could he not at least let them glimpse the **harmonious transformations of Tāng and Yú**?

Alas, the Sage was of Heaven. Heaven’s mind is the Sage’s mind. Heaven’s Way is the Sage’s Way. Heaven does not act for itself but entrusts it to the Sage; thus Heaven may remain without action. The Sage does not act for himself but entrusts it to the **Worthy**; thus the Sage may remain without action. But the Worthy must act.

The Sage acts without action above; the Worthy acts with action below—thus the **Dao of Sovereign and Minister** is fulfilled. Hence it is said: *"Act by non-action."* Again: *"Non-action yet nothing remains undone"*—for the **distinction of Sovereign and Minister** lies therein. The people’s steadfastness is where their **endeavors** reside.

In the **Great Primordial Age**, the **Mystic Wind** unified the Way under Heaven. In the **Xīhuáng’s flourishing era**, the **Four Seas shared one Virtue**—this was the **non-action** that, in truth, was the **greatest action** for the world.

Though spoken of as *"non-action"* and *"action"*, its essence is **human-hearted Heavenly Principle**, all contributing to **wealth and transformation**. As for those who speak of the Sage without naming Him—was it not the **Nameless Sovereigns of the Great Primordial Age**, or the Sovereigns **Xī, Xuān, Yáo, and Shùn**?

To honor the Ancient Sage is to honor the present Sovereign and his age; to prolong this Way is to prolong this world.

**Chapter Sentences of the *Dàodéjīng***
The *Chapter Sentences* of the *Dàodé* were composed by **Hé Shànggōng**.

When Emperor Wén of Hán valued **tranquility and stillness**, he commanded the court scholars to study the *Lǎozǐ*, yet no annotated text existed. Its language was profound and abstruse, much of it unclear. He heard of an old man in the **Shǎn-Hé region** who mastered the *Lǎozǐ*, so he sent an envoy to inquire. The old man presented the Emperor with a plain-text copy of the *Lǎozǐ*, clarified its meaning, and divided it into **eighty-one chapters**, each marked with two characters to elucidate its essence—such as *"Cultivating the Dao"*, *"Nurturing the Body"*, *"Calming the People"*, and the like. From these *Chapter Sentences*, commentaries arose.

Yet as the Way descended with the ages, interpretations varied. Commentators followed the trends of their times, each shaping the text to their own convictions. Thus, the **Hán commentators** produced the *Hán Lǎozǐ*, the **Jìn** the *Jìn Lǎozǐ*, the **Táng** the *Táng Lǎozǐ*, and the **Sòng** the *Sòng Lǎozǐ*. Some spoke of **emptiness and non-action**; others of **breathing techniques and guided movements**; still others of **nature, fate, fortune, misfortune, warfare, and statecraft**. Their explanations diverged like bells, each school claiming its own method—none grasping the **original intent of Dao and Virtue**, nor the **essential principle of Inner Sage and Outer King**. Thus, they failed to illuminate one another but instead contradicted, alas!

Even **Guān Zhòng** and **Wén Zǐ**, who had glimpsed the **Dragon’s essence**, wrote works that strayed from their masters’ teachings. **Liè Zǐ** and **Zhuāng Zǐ**, though close in time, diverged—**Liè** emphasizing **emptiness and stillness**, **Zhuāng** veering toward **profound and distant**—nearly transcending humanity, yet falling short of Heaven. Later, **Sūn Bīn** and **Wú Qí** distorted it into **martial strategy**, while **Shēn Bùhài** and **Hán Fēizǐ** twisted it into **legalist scheming**—truly, **human yet not Heavenly**. No wonder, after a thousand years, none could verify its truth.

Yet **Gāi Kē** and **Cáo Cān** practiced **tranquility and unity**, thereby establishing the **Hán dynasty’s prosperous peace**—these were true practitioners of the *Lǎozǐ*’s Way.

Now, observing **Hé Shànggōng’s** division into chapters, though his interpretations were **ethereal and profound**, they aligned with the *Jīng*’s essence. Yet his chapter titles lacked elucidation, leaving those who sought governance in confusion. Thus, this *Original Meaning* was composed.

Now, instead of recording the chapter titles, the *Jīng* itself is honored. As for their meanings, they are expounded within the *Original Meaning*, and the chapter titles are thus incorporated into a single exposition.

**The Compilation of Mysterious Chapters**
**Mysterious Compilation** is the pivot and essence of the Five Thousand Words.

The **Laozi** said:
*"Words have a source; deeds have a master."* This means that all my sayings have their origin, and their foundations can be traced back to the words of ancient sages.

*Deeds are easy to know and easy to practice—yet why does the world fail to know them or practice them?*

**Zhongni** (Confucius) revered the teachings of **Yao** and **Shun**, and followed the constitutional models of **King Wen** and **King Wu**. Though they share the same source, their names differ. Once they are seen, one inquires about **ritual** (*li*). Then, in retreat, one privately compares them.

*If one faithfully recounts the ancient teachings and trusts in antiquity, one must have insight into that era.*

Now, with the creation of *The Origin of Intentions* (*Yuánzhǐ*), having already expounded its meaning, I further distinguish its principles in separate sentences. Thus, those who study **Mysterious Compilation** may verify sentences through categories, verify chapters through sentences, and verify meanings through chapters. Perhaps then the original intent of the **Mysterious Sage** may be made clear to all under heaven and to future generations.

*Those who speak of governing the Dao/Way—how can they afford to neglect it?*

**The Dao/Way that can be spoken of**—
*The Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way.*
*The Dao/Way that endures is the Dao/Way of longevity and clear vision.*
*The Dao/Way of Heaven’s law is the Dao/Way of natural law.*
*Those of high virtue who hear the Dao/Way diligently practice it.*
*The Dao/Way of clarity is like darkness.*
*The Dao/Way of smoothness is like ruggedness.*
*The Dao/Way of advancement is like retreat—better to sit and progress in this Dao/Way.*
*Seeing the Dao/Way without peering through windows means seeing the Heavenly Dao/Way.*
*The Dao/Way of action is daily diminished.*
*The Dao/Way of the Sage is to act without striving.*
*Thus, all things honor the Dao/Way and attribute virtue/power to it.*

*The Heavenly Dao/Way completes its function, attains its name, and withdraws—this is the Heavenly Dao/Way.*
*The Heavenly Dao/Way does not strive yet triumphs effortlessly.*
*The Heavenly Dao/Way has no favorites, always aiding the virtuous.*
*The Heavenly Dao/Way benefits without harming.*
*The Heavenly Dao/Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.*
*But the human Dao/Way is otherwise: it diminishes deficiency to honor excess.*
*Ancient Dao/Way—those who held the ancient Dao/Way were the ancient ones who excelled in the Dao/Way. Why did the ancients value this Dao/Way?*
*See above for the Dao/Way’s honor.*

*Those who possess the Dao/Way do not dwell in the world.*
*Those who possess the Dao/Way turn away even the finest horses to dung—who else can diminish excess to benefit the world? Only those who possess the Dao/Way.*

*The Great Dao/Way, once abandoned, gives rise to benevolence and righteousness.*
*The Great Dao/Way, once lost, can be found on either side.*
*The Great Dao/Way is most smooth, yet people prefer narrow paths.*
*If I were to know this clearly, I would walk the Great Dao/Way.*
*See above for the practice of the Dao/Way.*

*The Dao/Way that is not the Dao/Way has already perished.*
*What is not the Dao/Way is not the Dao/Way at all.*
*Losing the Dao/Way, one then attains virtue/power.*
*The Dao/Way’s beginning can know the ancient origin—this is called the Dao/Way’s beginning.*
*The Dao/Way’s splendor is the beginning of wisdom, yet the beginning of foolishness.*
*The Dao/Way’s profundity—those who grasp the Dao/Way are the profound ones. The Dao/Way of all things is profound; the honor of the Dao/Way is supreme.*

*The Dao/Way’s law is natural law.*
*The Dao/Way’s constancy—constancy without name, constancy without action yet accomplishing all actions.*
*The Dao/Way’s generation—generation that generates all things.*

**Virtue/Power**
*Broad virtue/power—broad virtue/power seems insufficient.*
*Established virtue/power—established virtue/power seems like a rank.*
*Accumulated virtue/power—early service is called heavy planting of virtue/power.*
*Those with virtue/power govern through trust.*
*Those without virtue/power govern through strictness.*
*The virtue/power of **Kong** (*Confucius*)—the bearing of **Kong**’s virtue/power.*
*All things honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power.*
*The Mysterious virtue/power endures yet is not slaughtered—this is called Mysterious virtue/power.*
*Always knowing the models—this is called Mysterious virtue/power.*
*The constancy of virtue/power never strays, returning again to the infant.*
*The constancy of virtue/power never errs, returning again to the boundless.*
*When virtue/power is sufficient, it returns again to simplicity.*

*The virtue/power of the highest—*
*The highest virtue/power does not claim virtue/power.*
*The highest virtue/power acts without striving yet accomplishes nothing without action.*
*The highest virtue/power is like a valley.*

*The virtue/power of the lowest—*
*The lowest virtue/power does not lose virtue/power.*
*The lowest virtue/power acts with striving and accomplishes something.*
*The virtue/power that does not strive—*
*Those who do not strive for virtue/power attain the highest virtue/power—this is called the virtue/power of non-striving.*

*Virtue/power in harmony—*
*Those who harmonize with virtue/power are in virtue/power.*
*Those who harmonize with virtue/power, virtue/power also attains them.*
*The true virtue/power is cultivated in the body—then its virtue/power is true.*
*The virtue/power of abundance is cultivated in the home—then its virtue/power is abundant.*
*The virtue/power of length is cultivated in the village—then its virtue/power is long.*
*The virtue/power of fullness is cultivated in the state—then its virtue/power is full.*
*The virtue/power of universality is cultivated throughout the world—then its virtue/power is universal.*
*The virtue/power of depth is the depth of virtue/power.*
*The virtue/power of goodness—even those who are not good, I also treat as good: this is virtue/power of goodness.*
*The virtue/power of trust—even those who are not trustworthy, I also trust: this is virtue/power of trust.*
*The virtue/power of nurturing—nurturing virtue/power.*
*The virtue/power of nobility—noble virtue/power.*

**Before Heaven**
*Before Heaven, there was the **mysterious substance** (*hun*) formed in unity.*
*Before Heaven and Earth, there was generation.*
*Boundless returns again to boundless.*
*To reach the utmost emptiness, one must guard stillness with sincerity.*
*Ancient emptiness is called matching Heaven—this is the ancient emptiness.*
*Without beginning, without name—this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*
*Ancient beginning can know the ancient beginning—this is called the Dao/Way’s beginning.*
*With beginning, the world has a mother.*
*Without form—this is the form of the formless.*
*With form—dim and vague, yet within it, there is form.*
*The Great Form—*
*The Great Form has no shape; yet those who grasp the Great Form move all under Heaven.*
*The Form precedes—this is the Form before the **Emperor** (*Di*).*
*Unity in the Mysterious—*
*Unity is called the Mysterious.*
*Again, the Mysterious of the Mysterious—*
*Deep and obscure, yet within it, there is essence.*
*Dim and vague, yet within it, there are things.*
*The root of Heaven and Earth—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.*
*The gate of all wonders—this is called the gate of all wonders.*
*The Mysterious Mother—this is called the Mysterious Mother.*
*The source of all things—this is called the source of all things.*

**Heaven and Earth**
*Heaven and Earth without substance are called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*
*Heaven and Earth without benevolence regard all things as fodder and dogs.*
*Between Heaven and Earth, it is like a bellows.*
*The Mysterious Mother is called the root of Heaven and Earth.*
*Heaven endures long, Earth endures long—who can do this?*
*Heaven and Earth in unity descend sweet dew.*
*Heaven gains **Oneness** (*Yī*) and becomes clear; Earth gains **Oneness** (*Yī*) and becomes tranquil.*

**All Things**
*All things with substance are called the mother of all things.*
*All things act yet do not speak.*
*Deep and obscure, like the source of all things.*
*Water benefits all things yet does not strive.*
*All things arise together, yet I observe their return.*
*All things will naturally come as guests.*
*All things rely upon it to live yet do not speak.*

**Nurturing All Things**

Nurture all things yet claim no mastery.
All things will transform of their own accord.
All things gain **Oneness** (*Yī*) and thrive.
The myriad things arise from existence.

Three transformations give birth to all things;
All things bear yin yet embrace yang.
All things follow the **Dao** and cherish virtue.
Grass and wood in their growth are soft and frail.

No thing returns to nothingness.
Things arise from the mingling of things.
Strange things arise from strange things.
Things grow strong yet grow old.

The myriad names do not depart,
To observe the myriad names.
**The World**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness already exists.
To value oneself for all under Heaven,
As if one could entrust all under Heaven.
To love oneself for all under Heaven,
As if one could commit all under Heaven.

Thus, the Sage embraces **Oneness**,
Setting the model for all under Heaven.
Can become the mother of all under Heaven.
Yet lightens himself for all under Heaven.
Becomes the valley for all under Heaven.
Sets the model for all under Heaven.

To take all under Heaven and act upon it—
All under Heaven is a sacred vessel.
Do not use force to conquer all under Heaven.
Cannot fulfill one’s will in all under Heaven.
All under Heaven dare not submit.

**The Dao** in all under Heaven—
Holding the great image, all under Heaven turns toward it.
All under Heaven will self-correct.
The sovereign who gains **Oneness**,
Makes it the standard for all under Heaven.

All under Heaven’s myriad things arise from existence.
The utmost softness of all under Heaven,
Gallops over the utmost firmness of all under Heaven.
Few can attain it.
Clarity and stillness govern all under Heaven.
To take all under Heaven, always act without action.

When all under Heaven is in **Dao**,
Warhorses are driven out to till the fields.
When all under Heaven is without **Dao**,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

The Sage in all under Heaven—
Dull and indistinct, blending the hearts of all under Heaven.
Cultivating all under Heaven, virtue becomes universal.
Viewing all under Heaven with all under Heaven,
Thus, all under Heaven honors the Sage.
Taking all under Heaven with non-action.

All under Heaven abounds in taboos,
Yet the people grow poorer.
Rule all under Heaven with **Dao**,
And its spirits lose their power.

Great nations flow downward,
The confluence of all under Heaven.
Difficult tasks arise from ease,
Great affairs arise from small.

Thus, all under Heaven finds joy in advancing without weariness.
Only by not contending
Does all under Heaven find none who can contend with it.
Dare not lead all under Heaven.
All under Heaven cannot know, cannot act.
Who can, with abundance, serve all under Heaven?

Nothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,
Yet it can reign over all under Heaven.

**States**

States with many sharp tools grow corrupt.
States in chaos have loyal ministers.
A state with its mother-state can endure long.
Neighboring states face one another.

To govern a state and love its people,
Can one truly act without action?
Rule with rectitude.
Govern a great state as one would cook a small fish.
To govern with knowledge is the ruin of the state.
To govern without knowledge is the state’s blessing.

Great states flow downward,
The confluence of all under Heaven.
Great states subdue small states, then take them.
Great states desire only to nurture the people.
Small states submit to great states, then are taken.

**The weak employ the Way of the weak**—*qi* does not boast, yet it endures.
**It does not boast of its own strength**, so it grows;

and those who cut themselves down achieve no merit.

**The Way of non-action** is always non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
**The virtue of the highest Sage** is non-action, yet nothing is left undone.
**The highest Benevolence** acts, yet does nothing.
Thus, I know the benefit of non-action.
**The benefit of non-action**, few under Heaven can attain.
**To diminish again and again**, until reaching **non-action as non-action**,
**non-action yet nothing is left undone**—
**to govern with love and nurture the people**,
can one truly achieve non-action?

**action**
**Action belongs to lower virtue**—those who act do so with purpose.

**The Original Doctrine’s Essence**
The Original Doctrine’s Essence—its unfolding, Volume Below Complete.
The Original Doctrine’s Essence—its unfolding, Preface.

In the beginning of antiquity, everyone was Laozi, every home held virtue and Dao.
Words could not be heard—how could there be five thousand words as scripture?

The Great Uncarved Block scattered; the Original Scripture gathered the seven.
A sage traversed Shang and Zhou, laughing at strife and contention, imagining the Great Court’s irrecoverable loss.
Thus, he spoke five thousand words to expound ancient principles and rectify the mind.

The Blue Ox departed far; subtle words were buried, five thousand words expanded into tens of thousands.
To exhaust the Dao’s virtue, making it vast.

The True Person coexisted with the Three Sovereigns—
Surely he did not write books, lest later ages exhaust Hanwen and Gai Gong.
Thus, the Original Doctrine’s book also does not emerge from today’s Riverbank.

This book, from before Heaven, has twelve chapters, standing alone as a text.
Opening and closing ancient and modern, weaving logic and numbers,
Grasping the Gate’s intent, gathering the Great Achievement of Mystic Learning.

「He who reads this text shall stand in awe of the **Hongmeng** (the primal chaos of creation), and find himself naturally attuned to the **Jiande** (the Virtue of the Lord on High).
The past and present fade away, the self and the world are both forgotten—
just as **Yuanming** (Xian Zhi) ascended to **Xihuang** (the Dao of the Primordial Sovereign),
or sought the **Weiyin** (the awe-inspiring resonance) of the **Chanzong** (Zen Patriarchs).

The **Taiji** (Great Polarity) of **Mao Shou** (Master Mao of the Zhou) was originally **Wuji** (Non-Polarity).
Though it unfolded with **wuyun** (flourish and decline), the ancient and modern remain undivided.

The **Dao** (Way) and its arts may diverge,
yet the **universe** (Tianren) has but one body—
how can one know that **Laozi** (the Old Master) was not **Zisheng** (the First Sage)?
And how can one know that **Zisheng** (the First Sage) was not **I**?

In the midst of **Bai Shidongtian** (White Stone Cave’s celestial realm),
where water gleams and mountains rise,
I take up my staff and bow three times,
for those who inquire shall surely trace it back to me.

The **Lu Mountain Daoist, Huang Shigong** (Master Huang of Yellow Stone) respectfully dedicates this book.

Did the people truly have a beginning?

To open things and complete undertakings,
beyond the **thirteen gua** (trigrams) there is no further account,
yet the records of **Yunhuo** (Cloud Fire), **Shuili** (Water and Land), **Long** (Dragon), and **Niao Shi** (Bird Master)
and **Zishouzi** (Master Zhi of the Chen) bear witness to its truth.

Thus, **Zhuang Zhou**’s discourse on **Rongcheng** (Nourishing Perfection) and the twelve **Shi** (Sages),
was it not a **yuyan** (allegorical tale)?

Before **Huangdi** (the Yellow Emperor), there were seven **Tai** (Great) who ascended Mount Tai—
were they not **yicuo** (imagined conjecture)?

The **Five Sovereigns** (Wutai) initiated change,
and **three transformations** (San San) took root.
When the **Nine Ages** (Jiuzhi) concluded, the **Jia calendar** (Jia calendar system) emerged—
one can trace its origin,
and glimpse its subtle traces—
only in the **Book of Huangji** (the *Huangjing*) and the **Laozi** (the *Laozi*) does this remain.

Yet when I ponder it,
the **Yuanhui** (Great Cycle), **Yunshi** (Evolution of the World), and **Dayan** (Great Year) are vast,
while **years, months, days, and times** are minute.

The division of **Huangdi** (the Yellow Emperor) and **Wangbo** (the August Sovereign),
the fulfillment of opening and closing things—
its essence can be examined.

**Dayi** (Day of Jia), **Monthi** (Month of Yi), **Xinggui** (Star of Gui),
mark the age of **Shaohao** (Minor Hao),
and the **Jiazi** (Jia-Zi) calendar begins.

**Dayi** (Day of Jia), **Monthwu** (Month of Wu), **Xingjia** (Star of Jia),
signify the day of **Xia Yu** (Great Yu of Xia),
and the **Wangdao** (Way of the Kings) takes form.

Yet then, from the **6480 years** hence,
the reckoning breaks at **Yao** (Emperor Yao).

From **Jiachen** (Jia-Chen) onward—
were there no events worthy of record?
It is merely that **strategies and documents** (jiance) were lost and scattered,
and though raised, they lack confirming evidence—
this is why **Yao**’s deeds were omitted.

**Du Zunsheng** (Master Du of the Southern Valley),
a **Daoist** (Dao) spanning two dynasties,
his learning delving into ancient origins,
once declared that the **eight gua of one’s person** (Yibing Ba Gua),
were the signs of **Pangu opening Heaven** (Pangu’s creation of the cosmos),
and the **dawn and night of a day** (Dan-Ye),
the distinction between opening and closing things.

Thus, I gathered the **Nine Ages** (Jiuzhi) from ancient histories and calendars,
and cross-referenced them with **Laozi**’s subtle meanings,
to trace back to the **first, middle, and latter Three Sovereigns** (Sanhuang San San),
and connect them to the **established human extreme** (Renji) of **Huangdi** (the Yellow Emperor).

By this method, one can find
the **original intent** (Yuanshi) of the *Huangjing* (Book of Huangji),
and its purpose is to **revere the Sovereign’s Dao** (Huangdao) and **praise the Emperor’s virtue** (Dide).

I titled this book *Expounding the Original Intent* (Yuanshi Faxi),
divided into twelve chapters.

The first six chapters conclude with the **Zhou** (Zhou Dynasty),
the latter six expound on **Laozi**’s (the Old Master) beginning and end.

In essence, it reveals that **Laozi**’s (the Old Master) person was **Cangshi** (Hidden Historian),
his **five thousand words** (Wuyan) encompassing all the books of the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** (Sanhuang Wudi),
with **profound words** (Xian) and **deep intent** (Suishi),
a **Cangshi** (Hidden Historian) without name in antiquity—
thus I took them to supplement **Shaozi** (Master Shao’s) unexpressed accounts,
and perhaps this is the book that humanity ought to have.

A disciple of **Laozi** (the Old Master), I say:
Words that touch upon **Heaven and Man** (Tianren) are beyond reach,
yet if rulers of states grasp his teachings and apply them,
then the **sovereign** (Jun) shall be **youshu** (auspicious and harmonious) above,
and the **ministers** (Chen) shall be **minxing** (responsive and sensitive) below—
thus the people shall be nurtured by **mystic transformation** (Xuanhua),
perhaps this is **Laozi**’s (the Old Master) true intent.

Therefore, the account is made.

In the **tenth year of the Great Virtue** (Dayan) season of **winter** (Dong),
on the **twelfth month** (Shiyue), the **full moon** (Wang) of the **twenty-fourth day** (Ershi),
**Shidi** (Disciple) **Juchang Ren** (任士林) of **Shu** (Shu),
wrote this in the **moneyed abode** (Qiantang) of the **Natural Daoists** (Ziran Daoshi).」
