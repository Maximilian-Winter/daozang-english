**Scripture Title:** *Commentary on the Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility*
**Commentator:** Du Guangting, a Daoist of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period.
**Volume:** One.
**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Washen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.

**Commentary on the Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility (Fascicle Five)**
**Annotated by:** Du Guangting, Grand Master of Propagating the Dao, Transmitted Perfected Reality, Celestial-Bestowed Purple Robe, and Vast Accomplishment.

**The Supreme Lord Lao**
*"Tai"* (Supreme) signifies greatness. *"Shang"* (Above) signifies reverence. None among the lofty Perfected precede Him, and all sages hold Him in shared veneration. Thus, He is called the *Supreme Lord Lao*.
*"Lao"* (Old) denotes longevity, for the Lord Lao cultivates Heaven and Earth, naturally attaining long life—hence, *Lao*.
*"Jun"* (Lord) is a title of honor, for His Dao is pure and His virtue perfect—thus, *Jun*.
This clarifies that the Lord Lao is the Ancestor of all sages, the Origin of true spirits, and that all myriad things are fashioned by Him. Therefore, He is the Primordial Ancestor.

**The Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility**
This elucidates the principle of purity and tranquility.
*"Chang"* (Constant) means *dharma* (law). By constantly adhering to this law, the scripture embodies purity and tranquility.
*"Qing"* (Pure) is the primordial. *"Jing"* (Tranquil) is *qi*.
*"Jing"* (Scripture) is the *dharma* (law): first, it is the path of the sages; second, it is the ladder of the immortals. All who study the Dao attain true sageliness through scripture and precepts.
No sage arises without relying on scripture and precepts, nor does any achieve the Dao without the primordial *qi*.
This chapter’s verses are divided into three sections: first, clarifying the formless Dao; next, expounding the principle of its movement; and last, elucidating the nameless *dharma*.

1. **Clarifying the Formless Dao**
2. **Clarifying the Unfeeling Dao**
3. **Clarifying the Nameless Dao**

**First: Clarifying the Formless Dao, Which Shapes Heaven and Earth, Dividing and Judging the Pure and Turbid**
The Lord Lao said: *"The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth."*
*"Dao"* is the term uttered when the mouth opens and the tongue moves. It is also said: *"Dao"* is the *qi* of emptiness and nothingness, the origin of primordial chaos, the ancestor of *Qian* and *Kun*, capable of being and non-being, encompassing Heaven and Earth.
The Dao is fundamentally formless, defying all names.
The form of the formless is called the *true form*; the image of the imageless is called the *true image*.
It precedes Heaven and Earth yet is not ancient; it follows Heaven and Earth yet is not old.
It manifests without form, stands without image, and transforms without action. Thus, it is called the *Great Dao*.
The scripture says: *"Look for it, and it cannot be seen."* Hence, it is *formless*.
Vast and obscure, within it lies essence; chaotic and undifferentiated, it divides into *yin* and *yang*, thus forming Heaven and Earth.
*"Yu"* (Nurture) means to nourish. It fosters *yin* and *yang*, hence *giving birth and nurturing*.
*Yang* is pure, ascending to become Heaven. *Yin* is turbid, sinking to become Earth. Heaven and Earth are the children of the Great Dao.
This section clarifies the unfeeling yet operative nature of the Dao, the function of *yin* and *yang*.

The sun and moon are the essence-*qi* of *yin* and *yang*. The Great Dao is unfeeling, yet it moves the sun and moon.
From non-being, it generates being, shaping and transforming to form all things.
Without the essence-*qi* of Heaven, there would be nothing to govern the brightness of the sun and moon; without the essence-*qi* of Earth, there would be nothing to stabilize the mountains and peaks; without the essence-*qi* of humans, there would be nothing to sustain the body’s existence.
Thus, the sun and moon receive their movement from *yin* and *yang*.
Therefore, the Dao’s lack of feeling follows the mechanism of transformation.
It is also said: *"What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed."* *"What does Earth say? The myriad things are born."*
The scripture says: *"Its use is inexhaustible."* It is unfeeling yet moves the sun and moon.
The sun and moon are the functions of the Great Dao.

**This section clarifies the nameless Dao, which spontaneously gives life to and nurtures the myriad things.**
The Great Dao is nameless, nurturing the myriad things.
The primordial *qi* is formless and cannot be named.
The scripture says: *"The Dao is hidden and nameless."*
It is born of Heaven and Earth.
Thus it is said: *"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things."*
The myriad things are the descendants of the Five Phases.
The Three Powers (*Heaven, Earth, Humanity*) are the parents of the myriad things.
The Dao is the ancestor of the Three Powers.
Thus, the primordial *qi* is pure and tranquil, and cannot be constantly named.
Those who study the Dao must observe the origin and examine conduct. If one’s wisdom and nature are unimpeded, one may ascend the path of the Great Dao, roam beyond the Three Powers—something ordinary people cannot comprehend.

The preceding chapter clarifies the formless and nameless nature of the Dao, enabling it to move the sun and moon.
These two phrases are the Supreme Lord’s self-designation, a name for the nameless, forcibly called the *Dao*.
*"I do not know its name; forcibly, I call it Dao."*
*"Wu"* (I) means *me*. This shows the Supreme Lord saying: *"I do not know its name; forcibly, I call it Dao."*
This also clarifies that the highest virtue does not act as virtue, hence the meaning of *having virtue*.
The Lord Lao shapes Heaven and Earth, opens *Qian* and *Kun*, transforms the myriad things, yet does not say *"I am the cause."*
The Dao follows spontaneity and cannot be named.
At times, it moves from being to non-being, or from non-being to being; its concealment and manifestation are boundless, its existence and cessation are free—how could it have a constant name?
Thus, the scripture says: *"I do not know whose child it is; it seems to have existed before the Lord of Heaven."*
It also says: *"I do not know its name; I style it the Dao."*

The first two phrases clarify the Supreme Lord’s self-designation, for the Dao is nameless.
The following nine phrases elucidate the exalted and humble nature of the Great Dao, using the primordial *qi*’s purity and tranquility and the analogy of Heaven, Earth, male, and female.
Within this chapter, it is divided into three sections:
1. **Clarifying the Dao’s division into pure and turbid, movement and stillness by analogy;**
2. **Clarifying the mechanism of movement and stillness in Heaven, Earth, male, and female;**
3. **Clarifying the origin and end of the myriad things.**

*"The Dao has purity and turbidity, movement and stillness."*

The pure is Heaven, for the *qi* of true Yang ascends and forms Heaven. The turbid is Earth, for the *qi* of true Yin descends and congeals into Earth. *Fu* is an introductory particle. The Dao can be pure or turbid, active or still—so vast and unfathomable is the Great Dao that the terms "pure," "turbid," "active," and "still" all serve as its functions. Thus, those who study the Dao: if they can comprehend the *qi* of activity and stillness, stabilize their position, then the Great Dao will naturally return to them. When activity and stillness are in harmony, this is called the correct state.

These four phrases, together with the preceding three, all elucidate the principles of purity and turbidity, activity and stillness. Combined with the following two phrases, they form a single chapter, revealing the exalted and humble positions of the Great Dao, as well as the origin and end of all things.

Within these three sections, the second clarifies the functions of purity and turbidity, activity and stillness in male and female. Heaven is pure, Earth is turbid; Heaven is active, Earth is still. Male is pure, female is turbid; male is active, female is still. *Liezi* says: "Heaven is but accumulated *qi*; Earth is but accumulated masses." Heaven and Earth are joined, never to be separated. All above Earth is Heaven. There are many Heavens and many Earths, each with different names. On all four sides and eight directions, above lie the Thirty-Two Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors, all composed of pure *qi*. Below lie the Nine Earths, and beneath the Nine Earths are the winds and waters. Beneath winds and waters, darkness unfathomable. From the Nine Earths upward to the various Heavens, all emerge from the *Hunyuan* Diagram. *The Upper Clarity Scripture* states: "In every direction, there are fifty-five myriad, five thousand, five hundred and fifty layers of Heaven, and the number of Earths is the same." This demonstrates the supremacy of the Great Dao, vast enough to embrace all, subtle enough to contain all.

Male is Yang; female is Yin. When a person is in the mother’s womb at the moment of conception, they receive the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang to form their body. Those who receive the pure Yang *qi* of Heaven and Earth become male. During the ten months, if they remain beneath the mother’s left armpit, it is a male. Those who receive the pure Yin *qi* of Heaven and Earth become female. During the ten months, if they remain beneath the mother’s right armpit, it is a female. The water-nature of the female is the *qi* of extreme Yin, thus she is still. The fire-nature of the male is the *qi* of extreme Yang, thus he is active. The active ascends and corresponds to Heaven; the still is turbid and sluggish, corresponding to Earth. Thus it is said: "Heaven is exalted, Earth is humble; Qian and Kun are established. Male is exalted, female is humble; Yin and Yang are divided." Hence, "male is active, female is still."

These two phrases clarify the origin and end. Together with the preceding seven phrases, they form a single chapter, divided into three parts. The origin flows into the end, giving birth to the myriad things. The origin is the primordial; the primordial is the Dao. The Dao originally encompasses primordial *qi*; primordial *qi* divides into the Two Modes; the Two Modes divide into the Three Powers; the Three Powers divide into the Five Phases; the Five Phases transform into the myriad things. The myriad things are the end. If one can embrace the primordial and guard the One, return to the Great Dao, and revert to the root, they do not return to the end. The end is transformation; the origin is generation. If one can return to the root, this is called the Dao of regulating and restoring life and nature. *The True Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: "Life is the congealing of spirit; death is the transformation of things." If one can return to true spirit, returning to true spirit is called reverting to the origin and returning to the source—one must not pursue things.

This section of four phrases clarifies the source of purity and turbidity, the foundation of activity and stillness. If one possesses the Dao, the Dao naturally returns. The pure is the source of the turbid; the active is the foundation of the still. If one can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth will all return. The pure is the *qi* of Heaven; the turbid is the *qi* of Earth. All things are born from the *qi* of purity and turbidity. If worldly people seek the Dao of longevity, refining Yin into Yang, refining to near-perfection and becoming a sage, it is all because the pure arises from the turbid, and the active arises from the still. Purity and turbidity are alternate names for the Dao. Those who study immortality, if they can firmly guard the Great Dao, all things will naturally return to them. Thus, *The Western Ascension Scripture* says: "The Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, and the seas do not desire fish, turtles, or dragons—yet fish, turtles, and dragons naturally return to them. If one can be pure and empty, desireless and non-active, though they do not seek the Great Dao, the Great Dao will naturally return to them." Simply guard the primordial *qi* of Great Harmony, embody the Dao and unite with the true, and all things will return.

These four phrases clarify that the heart and spirit are originally pure and still, but are disturbed by worldly desires. The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desires entangle it. Spirit is wondrous and unfathomable—it is called spirit. The heart is spirit; spirit is the heart. When the heart is disturbed, the spirit moves; when the spirit moves, the heart floats; when the heart floats, desires arise; when desires arise, the spirit is harmed; when the spirit is harmed, the Dao is lost. If one can subdue the heart, inwardly stabilize the spirit, and outwardly eliminate desires, they will naturally become pure and still. This refers to the following text.

This section of four phrases clarifies the effort of cultivation: dispelling desires and settling the heart to naturally attain purity and stillness. If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally become still; if one can settle the heart, the spirit will naturally become pure. *Dispel* is a metaphor for removal. If one can eliminate emotions and desires, inwardly guard primordial harmony, the heart and spirit will naturally be at peace. When the heart is at peace, how can worldly desires arise? Thus, citing *The Western Ascension Scripture*: "To teach people to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart; to teach people to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao." Therefore, one must cut off the single source of profit, cultivate truth and nurture nature, then preserve the heart and spirit in peace and joy. Thus, the sages say: "Cultivate truth and nurture nature, carry the spirit and support life—then one can leave suffering and ascend to joy, blessings and fortune will flow, and the true Dao is accomplished."

These two lines form a single passage, elucidating that through the cultivation of truth to the point of spiritual attainment, the six desires and three poisons naturally dissipate. Naturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished.

The six desires refer to the six roots. The six roots are the eye, ear, mouth, nose, heart, and intent. *Desire* signifies the appearance of attachment and the metaphor of emotional love. Perceiving external phenomena and becoming defiled is called desire—thus, the eye sees, the ear hears, the intent knows, and the heart perceives. If one can sever emotional attachments, dispel desires, settle the heart, forget anxieties, and stabilize the spirit, the six desires will naturally vanish—how could they arise? When the inner spirit does not stray outward and the six consciousnesses remain unmoved, the six roots naturally attain purity and thus do not generate.

The three poisons are extinguished. The three poisons are the roots of the three paths and the ancestors of the three karmas. The three are the body, heart, and mouth. When one possesses a body, the body engages in deluded actions; the heart harbors deluded thoughts; and the mouth utters deluded speech. These three karmas constitute the three poisons. It is also said that the three poisons are the three corpses: Peng Ju, Peng Zan, and Peng Jiao. The upper corpse delights in adornments, the middle corpse in rich flavors, and the lower corpse in lust. If one can sever attachment to adornments, distance oneself from rich flavors, and cut off lust, abandoning these three matters, it is called the extinction of the three poisons. Once the three poisons are extinguished, the spirit harmonizes, qi flows smoothly, essence solidifies, the three origins attain tranquility, the three karmas do not arise, and purity naturally ensues.

The three origins are the upper origin, middle origin, and lower origin. The upper governs the three realms, giving rise to all things, and the three origins under heaven oversee human nature and life. The upper origin presides over the Niwan Palace in the brain, forming the upper cinnabar field; the middle origin governs the Crimson Palace in the heart, constituting the middle cinnabar field; the lower origin rules the Sea of Qi, belonging to the Kidney Palace, forming the lower cinnabar field. These three origins—upper governing spirit, middle governing qi, and lower governing essence—thus oversee human nature and life. If one can sever the three karmas, preserve these three palaces, further refine the qi of the four seasons, circulate essence and vitality endlessly, then the three cinnabar fields will solidify, all harmonies will be gentle and compliant. The heart, like the great void, will be inwardly and outwardly pure and untainted—all due to the extinction of the three corpses, the removal of the false and retention of the true, which is the Dao of purity.

The preceding elucidates that cultivating truth to the point of spiritual attainment naturally extinguishes the six desires and three poisons. Here, it clarifies that if delusions remain unsevered and the heart becomes attached, one cannot exhaust wondrous function. The reason one cannot is that the heart is unsettled and desires remain undispelled. If one can eliminate the prior three karmas, the three corpses will be extinguished; when the three corpses are extinguished, the three cinnabar fields are preserved; when the three cinnabar fields solidify, qi flows unimpeded in endless circulation—then worldly desires cannot entangle the heart, and this is the Dao of purity. If one cannot single-mindedly devote effort, settle the heart, and sever anxieties, the heart cannot inwardly cultivate the supreme Dao, nor can it exhaust the principles of wondrous function. Without mastery over the monkey-mind, spirit and essence gradually dissipate. Once spirit and essence are lost, the six roots arise in delusion, and worldly desires entangle. This is what it means to be unable to extricate oneself from the net of birth and death, to struggle to escape the web of samsara.

The previous chapter clarifies the ability or inability to cultivate. This chapter uniquely elucidates that one can cultivate without attachment, break fixations, and attain truth. Nine essential sentences divide into three distinct meanings, forming a single passage.

For those who can dispel: inwardly observe the heart, and the heart has no heart. If one can sever emotions, abstain from excessive indulgence, and dispel desires, then the sins of the three karmas vanish. Without single-minded devotion to inner cultivation and guarding the Crimson Palace, one naturally observes one’s own heart inwardly. The heart is fire. Thus, citing *The Scripture of Inward Observation*: "The heart is fire, the essence of the great yang in the south, governing fire. It corresponds above to Mars and below to the heart." The heart as the Crimson Palace is spirit—its wondrous function unfathomable, its transformations without fixed form. Spirit relies upon it, its three leaves like a lotus. It is also said: when restrained, it is upright; when unrestrained, it is wild. In purity, it lives; in turbidity and agitation, it perishes. It illuminates the eight directions yet may darken in one. Therefore, those who study must observe it: the heart resides within form, yet one must not observe the heart through form. If one observes through form, it becomes a duality. Form is the dwelling; the heart is the master. The dwelling cannot observe the master, hence it must not be observed thus. One may cause the spirit to observe the heart. Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit. When the heart and intent guide qi and preserve spirit to observe, resonance naturally occurs. How does one know this? An ancient virtuous one said: "To cause qi and spirit to unite, spirit and heart, qi and the Dao, do not stray far from one another." Thus, the sages established methods to teach people: to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart; to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao.

When the heart has no attachments, there is no heart to observe. With no heart to observe, there is nothing to employ, nothing to cultivate—then one coalesces with the Dao in stillness. Thus, the heart having no heart is the Dao of purity.

Externally observe form, and form has no form. The heart is the master of form; form is the dwelling of the heart. Form without a master is unstable; the heart without a dwelling cannot stand. The heart resides within, form appears without. Inner and outer mutually sustain one another and cannot be separated. Heart and form both function yet must not be observed with fixation. Coalescing in primordial chaos, seemingly formless yet not nonexistent—if not for the absence of heart, how could one forget the body? Forgetting the body is called having no heart. This scripture states: "I have a great affliction, for I have a body. When I have no body, what affliction do I have?" Heart and form, in motion without defilement, at rest without attachment—this is what it means for form to have no form.

Observe things from afar, and things have no thingness.
The five phases give rise to transformation—this is called "things."
It is also said: that which congeals into solidity is called "form."
Whatever possesses form and substance is called a "thing."
That things have no thingness is called "the real," the true emptiness.

This scripture states: "Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is something."
That "something" is the marvelous functioning of the Dao—it is not the ordinary things of this world.
Once these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.
The three are heart, form, and things.
Within, without, and in between—all are without attachment: this is called non-action.
Having entered non-action, this is called the Dharma of emptiness.
Emptiness is the functioning of the Dao.
Where there is functioning and attachment, it cannot be called the Dao.

The preceding section discusses three matters.
This section alone clarifies the principle of non-emptiness and non-quiescence.
Though it bears the name of emptiness and quiescence, if all are without attachment, this is the true Dao.
These six lines form a single passage.

To observe emptiness as empty—emptiness has no emptiness.
Emptiness is true emptiness.
The characteristics of the Dharma of emptiness manifest in two kinds:
There is great emptiness, and there is small emptiness.
Great emptiness is the principle of non-action and non-non-action.
Small emptiness is the breaking of being to return to non-being, taking non-being as non-being—this is called small emptiness.
When both these emptinesses are absent, one naturally does not defile the true nature, and thus accomplishes the true Dao.

Emptiness has no great or small, nor any departure.
With attachment, it becomes manifest; without attachment, it remains hidden.
The characteristics of the Dharma of emptiness appear like a shadow following form.
To say there is no seeing is annihilation.
This Dharma abides eternally, like water or a mirror.
Within the human body, it governs life and nature.
All that dwells in substance relies on the Dao to complete its form.
Every kind of thing arises from the Dao without exception.

The great Dao is level and ever-present in things—it is not annihilation.
What is emptied is already without, and the without is also without.
Emptiness is neither great nor small, like the nature of the Dao, which has no length or shortness, nor any dust or defilement.
When awakened to, it is called true emptiness; when unawakened, it is called illusory appearance—it is not the supreme Dao.

The *Shangqing Scripture* states: "The characteristics of emptiness and illusion return again to illusion."
The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, established the characteristics of emptiness and illusion as skillful means,
responding to conditions and transforming in accordance with the moment,
teaching and guiding humans and heavenly beings to return to the supreme Dao.
The emptiness spoken of is not emptiness itself.
The characteristic of emptiness is the marvelous functioning of the Dao.
When the Dao functions, it is present; when it does not, it is absent.
It is neither absent nor present—this is not called the Dao.

The Dao is originally the formless form, the true that can be named.
Virtue is originally the imageless image—this is called the true image.
Vast and obscure, within it there is essence.
That essence is most true—it is not non-action.
When the ten thousand dharmas are all absent, this is called empty absence.
The Dao of empty absence is also not natural.
Breaking through this empty absence, one returns to the absence of absence.

When the absence of absence is absent, it is profoundly and eternally quiescent.
The absence of absence is the absence of attachment.
Though there is no attachment to views, one returns to the Dharma of quiescence.
The Dharma of quiescence is also absent—it is not quiescence, nor emptiness, nor absence.
To take non-emptiness as emptiness is called true emptiness.
To take non-absence as absence is the Dharma within absence.
The Dharma is also entirely absent, returning to true quiescence.
True quiescence is also absent—it is not the absence of Dharma.
It is neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor form.
Provisional names and appearances are used to transform and guide sentient beings.
All kinds of distinctions are attachments to views.
When attachments to views are absent, this is called the natural.

Purity and quiescence are not the Dharma of emptiness and quiescence.
When emptiness and quiescence are absent, then it is profoundly and eternally abiding, open and unobstructed—this is called the true and constant Dao.

The preceding six lines clarify the principle of emptiness and quiescence.
These four lines clarify that when emptiness and quiescence are both absent, the natural is without desire, and thus the true Dao is accomplished.

Quiescence has no quiescence—how could desire arise?
This clarifies that all dharma-characteristics return to quiescent extinction.
The true Dao is natural, eternally abiding and unchanging.
Without attachment or desire, one naturally accomplishes the Dao.

When desire does not arise, this is true stillness.
True stillness is the natural absence of desire.
With desire, affliction arises; without desire, the Dao arises.
This scripture states: "I have a great affliction, for I have a fivefold embodied self.
When I have no self, what affliction do I have?"
No self is no desire; no desire is called the true self.
The true self is the Dao-body.

The preceding four lines clarify the absence of desire and quiescence.
These four lines clarify the Dao of true nature, which responds to conditions and things without fail, naturally pure and still.
The true and constant respond to things.
"True" means the essence is without increase or decrease—this is called true.
"Constant" is the Dharma.
To constantly embody the Dharma is called the true and constant Dharma.
When the Dharma is true and constant, it responds to things and conditions, transforming and guiding sentient beings without fail—this is the thingness of the Dao.
"Constant" is the Dharma of the Dao.
"Responding" is the functioning of the Dao.
When Dharma and functioning are absent, both are the constant Dao.
Within the constant Dao, there is naturally the Dao of true response.
Thus it is said: the true and constant respond to things—this is the marvelous functioning of the Dao.

The true and constant attain nature.
To attain true nature, one must cultivate constant nature.
That which attains the nature of the Dao is movement.
To move one’s fundamental nature is to attain nature.
Constantly responding, constantly still, one is constantly pure and still.
Being in the nature of the Dao, one originally seeks purity and stillness.
Naturally responding to things, constantly functioning in the world,
without defilement or attachment, without filth or dust, one transforms in accordance with conditions.

This scripture states: "The highest good is like water."
Water benefits the ten thousand things.
It also states: "Harmonize its light, blend with its dust, profound and seemingly abiding."
That which abides is the Dao.
Originally pure and still, it constantly responds without fail,
adapting to all directions and remaining still without exception.

Thus it is said: "constant purity and stillness."
These six sentences mark the nature of prior purity and stillness.
As the nature of the Dao is pure and still, one attains true nature;
having attained true nature, one returns to the principle of non-attainment.
Through such purity and stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao.
This pure and still nature is called the true Dao.
The scripture does not speak of it, yet urges people to cultivate through nature,
gradually advancing to become true.
That which is true is able to endure and persist, neither increasing nor decreasing,
coexisting with heaven and earth in longevity—thus it is the true Dao.
Having entered the true Dao is called attaining the Dao.
Having entered the true Dao is called awakening to the cultivation of truth.
Refining the mundane into truth, refining truth into spirit,
that which is spirit and truth is the Dao.
Thus it coexists with heaven and earth in longevity, matches the sun and moon in brightness,
and transforms the ten thousand things—hence it is called attaining the Dao.
Though called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.
The Dao is without attainment or loss, and also without constant form.
This scripture states: "The Dao is originally formless, beyond all naming."
Thus it is said: though called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.
The great Dao abides constantly, without departure or dwelling.

It further states: "The highest virtue does not act as virtue, thus it possesses virtue."
Earlier, the principle of true nature’s Dao returning to non-attainment was clarified.
Here, the great sage establishes teachings with the nameless name,
forcibly naming it the Dao to instruct humans and devas,
responding to all beings. Though without fixed form, the awakened will surely attain it.
For the transformation of sentient beings, it is called attaining the Dao.
Transformation means returning to preserve truth—this is transformation.
Transformation signifies the meaning of change, altering appearances in response to conditions.
Transformations vary in kind, manifesting in forms and demeanors,
unfathomable in their presence or absence, guiding and transforming the people of the time.
To guide and transform is to point to matters as metaphors,
constantly exhorting and awakening—this is the name of teaching the Dao.
It universally urges later learners to abandon evil and follow goodness,
cherish the body and preserve life.
Thus it is essential to return to the sagely teachings.
For example, when the Most High transformed the eighty-one kingdoms west of the Flowing Sands,
he manifested in dharmic forms and appearances:
sometimes appearing as a giant, a thousand *zhang* tall,
sometimes as a small person, eighteen *chi* in height,
changing appearances without limit, altering forms and names.
Sometimes as a golden immortal, sometimes as a solar or brahmanic immortal,
he adapted his transformations to each region, sharing the same essence under different names.
Teaching people to cultivate the Dao, abandon delusion and become true,
he established the teaching of purity and stillness—all for transformation.
Manifesting his birth in the Grand Clarity, to the right of the Vortex Waters,
to the left of the True Source, where the Nine Wells endure and the Twin Cypresses remain,
he revealed the marks of the Dao to transform humans and devas.

The *Scripture of the Sage’s Chronicle* states:
From the primordial chaos of remote antiquity, whether undivided or just divided,
the Old Lord opened heaven and earth, arranged the sun, moon, and stars,
distributed the Five Phases, and transformed the ten thousand things, ceaselessly through the ages.
As the teacher of heavenly kings, he was unknown to the people of his time,
yet his transformations were not limited to the western lands.
The Dao is originally spontaneous, pervading all without exception;
in the ten directions and all heavens, none do not propagate the supreme Dao.
Throughout the cosmos, all is transformation.
Even the dullest creatures possessing life bear the nature of the Dao.
Those who can understand and comprehend it are called attainers of the Dao.
Those who awaken to it may transmit the sagely Dao.
Awakening is enlightenment, like penetration.
Penetration is attainment.
For all students of immortality, if they awaken to the true principle,
they will not regard the West or the East as distinct,
nor differentiate within the six directions, between heaven above and earth below—
the transformation of the Dao is one.
If one awakens and comprehends it, one does not exalt the supreme Dao,
nor regard the teachings of images as different, nor separate the Confucian school.
The three teachings of the sages differ in expression, yet their principle is one.
This scripture states: "Emerging together yet bearing different names."
It further states: "The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things."
Awakening to one’s fundamental nature is not attained through differentiation.
Only by embodying emptiness and nothingness can one constantly attain the supreme Dao returning to the self.
Cultivating purity and stillness within, one follows heaven and aligns with correctness;
harmonizing with human affairs externally, one can relieve suffering and dispel misfortune.
Through such cultivation, purity and stillness arise naturally.

Transmission is the name for bestowal and empowerment.
When one is pure and still, the supreme Dao comes of itself,
attained without seeking, accomplished without learning.
This scripture states: "The Way of Heaven is impartial, yet it constantly aligns with the good."
Purity and stillness arise naturally, and the sagely Dao returns to the self.
Thus it is said: one may transmit the sagely Dao.

In this passage, the earlier emphasis on non-contention and non-virtue
is followed by the observation that later learners, clinging to partial views,
are deluded by false emotions, losing the Dao and straying from the source.
The Old Lord thoroughly clarifies this earlier meaning:
as there are distinctions between high and low, he breaks through clinging to nature.
The Old Lord says: "The superior person does not contend; the inferior person loves contention."
Contention is the pursuit of stillness.
The superior person seeks tranquility amid contention, calming the fundamental nature to attain stillness.
Contention is clinging to existence.
The superior person does not cling to views of existence, nor is it about noisy strife.
Because the inferior person seeks to comprehend the fundamental nature,
they love contention in pursuit of stillness, clinging to views in their search.
This is called embodying the Dao and uniting with truth—
not attaching to the illnesses of the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, body, or mind,
nor to the flavors of saltiness, bitterness, spiciness, sweetness,
nor to the sounds of *gong*, *shang*, *jue*, *zhi*, or *yu*.
All such clinging to views is not the fundamental nature.
This is the principle of the inferior person’s love of contention.
With no mind in any view, how can there be contention?
If one has no contention, one is pure and still.

The highest virtue does not act as virtue; the lower virtue clings to virtue.
Virtue is nobility, possessing a name.
The highest virtue refers to the lords of remote antiquity who originally had no titles,
nor any designations—thus it is said they did not act as virtue.
This scripture states: "The highest virtue is non-action, which is what the Dao and virtue designate."

It further states: "What exists seems not to exist; what is real seems empty." If one clings to views of existence or to names in the Way, this is not the highest virtue. Fundamentally, there is neither being nor non-being, neither emptiness nor fullness. In application, it is present; when obscured, it is absent. Thus it is said: "The knowing do not speak; the speaking do not know." Those who know yet do not speak conceal it. Moreover, to know as if not knowing is superior; to know without knowing is a flaw—hence it is said the knowing cannot be spoken of. Therefore, the highest virtue does not act as virtue, while the lower virtue clings to virtue. Those of lower virtue who cling to virtue possess names, traces, and meritorious deeds, thereby establishing reputations and self-display. All views that arise give birth to discrimination.

The scripture also states: "When you meet it, you do not see its head; when you follow it, you do not see its rear." How can there be discrimination? Once discrimination arises, one clings to virtue. If one can eliminate the mind of duality, this is called the natural Way. Duality refers to the dharmas of action and non-action. Some establish non-action as right and refute action as wrong; others cling to action as right and refute non-action as wrong. This is the mind of duality. The supreme Way is natural—neither action nor non-action. Thus, the supreme Way is naturally profound, still, and pure, blended yet unstained, harmonious yet distinct, neither being nor non-being.

Those who study immortality must not cling to negation. If all clinging views are absent, one naturally attains the true Way, transcends the Three Vehicles, and returns to the One Vehicle. The Way does not descend to the inferior, so those who cling to virtue cannot be called the Way. Those who cling cannot be called the Dao and virtue. As previously stated, clinging to virtue is the lower virtue. Thus, clinging to forms and engaging in action is not called Dao and virtue. Dao and virtue are boundless in transformation, free in existence and cessation, manifest in application, able to honor and ennoble—all naturally so, not for those who cling to views. How could those who cling to views know it?

This passage clarifies why sentient beings fail to attain the true Way and perpetual purity. The reason sentient beings do not attain the true Way is the presence of deluded mind. Delusion is movement. When emotions float and intentions stir, the mind generates delusion. Movement is thinking, and delusion is the root of chaos. All sentient beings fail to attain the true Way because they are stained by emotions, moved by intentions, and deluded by thoughts. Thoughts give rise to feelings, and feelings stir emotions, deluding the mind. If the deluded mind does not arise, one is naturally pure and still.

It is also said: "Deluded movement is loss." All lose their inherent nature of the Way, following circumstances to stir emotions and delude the mind, thus failing to attain the true Way. Once the deluded mind arises, it startles the spirit. Startling is the extreme fear of the heart, called *jing*. This is not merely the heart’s alarm. There are two explanations for startling: first, in inner cultivation of purity, one forgets the form and startles the spirit; second, in external engagement with affairs, one wearies the mind and startles the body. Externally startling the body internally seduces and startles the spirit. If the heart and spirit are at peace, external desires do not arise. Once desires do not arise, one is naturally pure and still.

When the spirit is startled, one clings to the myriad things. If a person startles the spirit, externally they cling to circumstances, and internally they lose their true nature. The myriad things are a name for multiplicity. The Way values guarding the One; one must not cling to the myriad things and startle the spirit. Humans are born into the world, endowed within the four great elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, harmonized by qi, nurtured by the Three Powers—this is indeed difficult to surpass. If one can remain unshaken, inwardly guarding primordial harmony, thoughts will not be confused, and one will be naturally pure and still.

Once clinging to the myriad things, desire and seeking arise. Desire is the appearance of attachment. Though called attachment, it has two distinctions: first, desire for worldly affairs, seeking external adornments to delight the emotions—this is a yin fault, not in accord with yang teachings. Belonging to yin, it cannot be pure and still, becoming turbid and stagnant. Second, desire for progress in cultivation, exhaustively seeking true teachings and resolutely pursuing the supreme Way—this is inner desire. Though called desire, its principle accords with yang teachings, being light and pure, while yin is turbid and deviant. If one can embody the Way and unite with the real, one is naturally light and still.

Once desire and seeking arise, affliction follows. Yet desire for external affairs can gradually be severed; desire for inner cultivation should be encouraged with diligent progress. Even in seeking the supreme Way, one must not cling firmly, for this too generates affliction. Affliction has two kinds, distinguished by weight: minor affliction and major affliction. Minor affliction arises from desiring the supreme Way and clinging to it; major affliction arises from seeking worldly dharmas. Minor affliction accords with yang and is called purity; major affliction accords with yin and is called turbidity. Though distinguished by weight, one must not cling to either. Clinging is attachment. Once there is attachment, delusion arises.

By relinquishing the heavy and embracing the light, inwardly guarding primordial harmony, profoundly unmoving, this is called "cherishing the Way and embracing virtue," naturally simple and unadorned. The Way of longevity lies entirely in nurturing the spirit. If one guards primordial harmony without loss, the spirit abides within. When the spirit abides, the heart is greatly at peace, joyful and content, naturally pure and still—how could affliction arise? Affliction and delusion distress body and mind, leading to turbidity and disgrace, drifting through birth and death, forever sinking in the sea of suffering, eternally losing the true Way. When body and mind are attached to external circumstances, sorrow and suffering arise within.

The turbid is defilement; disgrace is pollution. When body and mind are defiled and polluted, one inevitably drifts and wanders—this is the cycle of rebirth. Trapped in the wheel of rebirth, one cannot escape the sea of suffering. The sea of suffering is the ocean of sorrow and affliction. "Sea" signifies vastness, for the sorrows and afflictions of life cannot be avoided. This is not because the supreme Way lacks compassion, but because the human heart creates its own suffering.

Those who study the Way must inwardly guard their unity while outwardly eliminating delusions. "Unity" refers to the body. The sages all speak of preserving the Three and guarding the One. The Three are essence, qi, and spirit. To guard the body is necessarily to preserve the Three. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Guard the body without loss, and it will abide constantly." By focusing solely on this unity and refraining from delusive thoughts, one avoids sinking into the sea of suffering. Sorrow and affliction will no longer cling to body and mind, and one naturally attains liberation, merging with purity and stillness.

Thus, the sages bequeathed their scriptures to rectify meaning, erecting the great bridge of the Dharma to close the paths of error. They taught and transformed those yet to awaken, guiding them into the wondrous gate. This makes clear that all people lose their true origin themselves—it is not that the supreme Way lacks compassion. The eternal and constant Way is attained by those who awaken. Those who awaken to the Way abide in constant purity and stillness. The true Way is ever-present, neither ancient nor modern, neither born nor destroyed. Externally, it encompasses heaven and earth; internally, it enters the finest hair. It is the law that governs all things and is ever employed in the world. Those who comprehend and awaken attain it for themselves, not for the sake of transforming others.

What the Most High speaks of is human awakening. To awaken is to return to one’s original nature—this is called attaining the Way. It is neither that the supreme Way is difficult to seek nor that it is easily obtained. This scripture states: "The Way of Heaven is impartial, yet it constantly bestows upon the good." It also says: "The Way is originally formless; nothing can name it." Those who attain awakening know it for themselves. The good constantly guard purity and stillness, and thus all are those who have attained the true Way.

This chapter is recorded in its entirety as one section. First, it clarifies that the Immortal Elder recited and upheld this method. Next, it recounts its transmission to the Lord of the Eastern Florescence. The celestial palaces and grotto-heavens all hold it in secret seclusion, for it is not to be lightly shared. The Immortal Ge Xuan said: "I attained the true Way after reciting this scripture ten thousand times." The Immortal’s surname was Ge, his given name Xuan, and his courtesy name Xiaoxian. When he first studied the Way, he constantly recited this scripture. Later, he attained the Way of immortality and now holds the rank of Left Immortal Elder.

The Immortal Elder had a grandson named Hong, courtesy name Zhichuan, whom the people of this world know as Baopuzi. Their ancestral line sought immortality, and all became perfected beings. When the Immortal Elder first entered the Way, he resided on Mount Changbai or on the Eastern Peak. Later, he traveled through all the famous mountains, diligently seeking the Way. After attaining the Way, he concealed his traces and transformed his form, leaving this scripture in the world to exhort and awaken later learners.

To speak of reciting the scripture ten thousand times means that ten thousand practices are perfected and complete. The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states that "the ten thousand models unfold," clarifying that the celestial Brahma-qi pervades all without exception. "Model" means method. All ten thousand methods are the same, responding both internally and externally. When dispersed, they become the forms of the ten thousand phenomena; when gathered, they form the bodies of the ten thousand spirits—this is the meaning of perfection.

It also says that when the ten thousand recitations are complete, the Way is perfected, and one ascends to the great void, the ten thousand spirits fulfilled. When the ten thousand recitations are complete, the Way of purity and stillness is achieved. It is not merely about reciting the scripture’s words—why should one exhaust the body and weary the spirit? This scripture is practiced by the Heavenly People and not transmitted to the unworthy. The Heavenly People are the immortals of utmost yang. The Heavenly Immortals soar through the azure vault, roaming freely, their armpits bearing feathers—they are also called Feathered Guests. All Heavenly Immortals and Feathered Guests dwell above the Three Clarities, constantly practicing the scriptures and methods, which are not lightly transmitted to the unworthy.

If worldly people cultivate the practices of the Heavenly People, they are called Heavenly Beings. For those who wish to study and learn, why not recite and practice this scripture daily, advancing in cultivation? Without a mind of laziness or retreat, one becomes a person of progress without regression. It is also not to be lightly transmitted to the unworthy. The sages also said: "When the scriptures and methods circulate in the world, if learners encounter them, they must treasure and honor them, not lightly disclose them. If one meets a worthy person with a sincere heart, then transmit; if one meets a good person, then pass it on." This is for the sake of widespread salvation, so that those who awaken may comprehend. Whether to transmit or teach depends on the person.

I formerly received it from the Lord of the Eastern Florescence. "I" is the Immortal Elder’s self-reference. According to the *Scripture of Supreme Purity*, in the east there is the Azure Cloud Realm, the Jasper Radiance Kingdom, and within the Emerald Feather City stands the Azure Dragon Palace. Its halls and towers are all constructed from dragon and phoenix treasures and precious pearls. Above, five-colored azure clouds cover it, hence it is called the Azure Dragon Palace. It is the dwelling place of the Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Youthful Sovereign. This clarifies that the Immortal Elder himself said that he encountered that Lord and received this scripture from him—it is not lightly transmitted to the unworthy.

The Lord of the Eastern Florescence received it from the Lord of the Golden Portal. The Golden Portal refers to the west, where there is the Coral Realm, the Jasper Radiance Kingdom, and within the Lapis Lazuli Palace. Its halls and towers are all constructed from coral, precious jades, and lapis lazuli, hence it is called the Lapis Lazuli Palace. There is a Lord within this palace who also treasures and secretes this scripture. He is also called the Lord of the Golden Portal. Depending on his name and title, or the Most High’s manifestations and transformations, the names and titles may differ.

The *Scripture of Supreme Purity* states: "The Later Sage, the Lord of the Golden Portal, the Mysterious Origin, the Yellow Emperor, the Venerable Lord"—this is the Most High. The *Master Yin’s Record of the Mysterious* says: "The Most High Lord Lao constantly resides in the Purple Tenuity Palace. Sometimes he is called the Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor, sometimes the Supreme One, the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, or the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal."

Thus we know the Most High manifests transformations according to place, and his appellations are boundless. It is known that the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal, ruler of the Lapis Lazuli Realm in the West, is none other than the Former Sage. All the exalted lord emperors have treasured and secreted this scripture—how much more should later students, in receiving and transmitting it, in cultivating, upholding, and reciting it, revere and esteem it, practicing it with utmost gravity?

The Lord of the Golden Portal received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother is the mother of all heavenly deities, divine kings, and lord emperors, and she resides on Kunlun. According to the *Treatise on Heaven and Earth*, "The Queen Mother dwells on the western side of Kunlun, where the Yellow River issues forth." She is the mother of heaven and earth. It is also said that the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother govern all perfected beings, presiding over the Three Realms—above in heaven and below on earth—making the Queen Mother the Most Honored Mother. When the Lord of the Golden Portal received this scripture from the Queen Mother, it was not lightly transmitted to those of lesser attainment. The Queen Mother passed it down orally, without committing it to writing.

Now, in this world, I have recorded it in written form. The oral transmission of ancient sages, in passing down scriptures and methods, always relied on the inner treasury of the heart and mind to secretly receive the scriptural texts. In circulating and propagating them to teach and guide humans and devas, they did not commit them to writing—unlike what is seen in the present age. Since the time of the immortal elders, this scripture has been written down and transmitted to later generations, widely disseminated to universally deliver and elevate later students.

First, the transmission by former sages is clarified; next, the hierarchy of later students is explained. If one can awaken to and comprehend the true Dao, one will attain fruition according to one’s merit.

The superior practitioner, upon awakening, ascends to become a celestial official. The superior practitioner externally refines the bodily form and internally nurtures the spirit. Externally, they harmonize their radiance and merge with the dust; internally, they cultivate merit and preserve their primordial essence. This *primordial essence* is the primordial qi. Primordial qi is the mother of spirit. If one can constantly abide in primordial qi, safeguarding it below in the Cinnabar Field, securing it above in the Mud Pill Palace, and guarding it at the center in the Crimson Palace, cherishing and preserving the Three Origins—this is called internally nurturing the spirit. Spirit is the child of qi; form is the dwelling of spirit. Spirit is the master of the body; without a master, the body is not at peace. Without spirit, form cannot stand.

The advanced practitioner constantly absorbs the essence of the sun, preserving it in the lower Cinnabar Field, and drinks the radiance of the moon, preserving it in the Brain Palace. The Brain Palace is the upper Cinnabar Field of the Mud Pill, belonging to yang, and thus the essence and qi of the Great Yin are preserved there. The lower Cinnabar Field, the Qi Sea of the Kidney Palace, belongs to yin, and thus the essence and qi of the Great Yang are preserved there. As the *Book of Changes* states: "The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao." If one can await the dual luminaries of the sun and moon to support the bodily form in practice, one will ascend to become a celestial official.

The *five clouds and five qi* are the true qi of the Five Phases. For those who tread the Dao above, once the five viscera are perfected, the qi of the five viscera naturally arises. The true qi of the Five Phases transforms into five clouds, supporting the bodily form as it ascends through the Three Realms. The Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. It descends to roam the Ten Directions. The Ten Directions are the four cardinal directions, four intermediate directions, above, and below. Once free from all obstructions in the Three Realms and Ten Directions, one ascends into the Supreme Purity and attains the title of celestial official.

The middling practitioner, upon awakening, is ranked among the immortals of the Southern Palace. Gold corresponds to the lungs; jade corresponds to the bones. Those who study the Dao must first refine their bones, calling them *precious jade*, and refine their lungs to preserve fluids, calling them *qi gold*. Stone corresponds to the kidneys; cinnabar corresponds to the heart. Calming the heart and regulating the breath to preserve the kidney viscera enables longevity—this is not the gold, stone, jewels, or jade of the mundane world. This *gold and stone* can preserve one’s life.

As the *Nanzi Tu* states: "How can external treasures compare to the preservation of internal treasures?" This is the meaning. If one can internally preserve one’s nature and life, one may ascend to partake in the sacred texts of Supreme Purity. The *sacred texts* are all the secret treasures of Supreme Purity. Those who attain the profound and subtle below reach the lower origin of the kidneys. The *Scripture of Supreme Purity* states: "In the south is the Cinnabar Spirit Heaven, within which lies the Palace of Medicinal Pearls. There resides a perfected lord named the Spirit Heaven Lord." It is also said that the Vermilion Yang Palace, or Vermilion Mound Palace, contains within its heavens a scorching refining pool, within which are palaces of the seven treasures, also called the Purple Yang Palace. If a practitioner who has attained the profound below succeeds in their studies, the True Lord of Life and Destiny records their name and petitions the Southern Palace, where they receive the title of immortal official.

The inferior practitioner, upon attainment, enjoys long life in the world. The inferior practitioner cannot sever the root of desire and seeks only methods to sustain the body and prolong life. Some ingest numinous medicines, some consume cinnabar, some renounce fame and abandon rank, some cultivate tranquility to pacify the spirit, some rely on forests and springs, some conceal their traces in the marketplace, internally cultivating the supreme Dao while externally harmonizing with the Five Constants. Whether hidden or revealed, they embody the Dao and unite with the real. If they persist without regression, they may still preserve longevity—how much more so for lofty scholars and worthy sages who seclude themselves in mountain valleys, study the arts of divine immortality, cultivate elixirs, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

Why are later people unable to achieve such single-minded devotion? Even now, the mountain-dwelling recluses Ding and Chen of Mount Hua in the Western Peak enjoy longevity in the world. Their names are recorded to enter the ranks of immortals—how can later people fail to emulate them? Thus, these examples are cited to illustrate that the supreme Dao is impartial, and those who seek it will surely attain it. As this scripture states: "The Dao of heaven is impartial; it constantly accords with the good." All paths ultimately converge as one. Roaming through the Three Realms, one ascends into the Golden Gate.

The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: "Among the thirty-two heavens and thirty-two emperors, the sixth is named the Heavenly Emperor of the Luminous Seven Luminaries, Shangming Qiyao Moye, which belongs to the Realm of Desire." Though such accounts exist, those who study the Dao need only eliminate desire to be called true persons. The Realm of Form comprises twenty-four heavens, with the Heaven of Boundless Vows as its highest, ruled by the Heavenly Emperor named Piaonu Qionglong.

Moreover, the Heaven of Supreme Primordial Radiant Joy and Forbidden Ascents serves as the Heavenly Emperor of the Formless Realm, named Longluo Juechang.

These Three Realms refer to heaven and earth, constituting the external framework in broad terms. Yet when likened to the human body, the Three Realms correspond to the three cinnabar fields: the lower cinnabar field as the Realm of Desire, the middle cinnabar field as the Realm of Form, and the upper cinnabar field as the Formless Realm. Should one preserve the three cinnabar fields, essence, qi, and spirit abide within the bounds of the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields—thus does the true person roam through the Three Realms. If the spirits of the three cinnabar fields are all complete, one naturally ascends to heaven. Hence the scripture states: "When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth"—this is what it means.

The *Scripture of Supreme Clarity* states: "The Great Canopy Heaven lies above the thirty-two heavens." The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* also says: "Above the Three Realms stretches the vast Great Canopy." Within the bounds of the Great Canopy exist only the palaces of the Three Clarities, where all the exalted sages and lofty venerables wander above. It further states: "There are fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred and fifty layers of heavens." These are not recorded in full here.

Moreover, the Tang dynasty worthy Le Penggui stated: "The eighty-one heavens are but half the lifespan of the Most High." This is spoken in broad terms. If the practitioner of the Dao first cultivates inner conduct and preserves the three primordial spirits within the Three Origins, once the three primordial spirits are all complete, one naturally ascends to heaven, roaming through the realms of the Three Clarities, entering and exiting before the Golden Gates, and paying homage to the Most High—thus becoming a true person. Hence it is said: "Ascending into the Golden Gate."

Earlier, the writings of the immortal masters distinguished the hierarchy of the most exalted studies. Here, what the true persons expound is the guidance of all beings, universally instructing them to recite and uphold the true scriptures, so that benevolent spirits may shield their bodies and they may gradually ascend the ranks of the immortals.

The Left Mystery True Person said: "Left is yang. Mystery is the One. The Dao Lord is titled 'Attainer of the One,' and the true persons stand to his left and right—this is the unity of yin and yang." Hence the name Left Mystery True Person. The Left Mystery True Person is titled "Dharma Interpreter." Out of great compassion, this true person responds to the many inquiries of the benevolent, descending into the Five Turbidities to rescue and deliver all beings. Upon returning to the Three Realms, he attends the Most High with reverence, and the Most High protects him, proclaiming his name.

For those who study immortality, simply preserving the One and guarding the yin and yang qi makes one a true person. What is meant by "guarding the One"? The One is the fundamental nature of the Dao. The One is the Great. It is also said to be the body. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Loving others is not as good as loving the body; loving the body is not as good as loving the spirit; loving the spirit is not as good as relinquishing the spirit; relinquishing the spirit is not as good as guarding the body. Guarding the body ensures longevity and eternal existence."

If learners have not yet grasped the subtle mysteries, they should first protect their form and cherish their qi, disdaining material things and despising fame, ensuring their thoughts are free from confusion. Thus, their blood and qi will be harmonious, and this alone is the One they may preserve. The yin and yang qi are the functions of Kan and Li, and thus they constitute the body of the true person. Thereafter, paying homage to the Most High, all may become ministers of the Dao. Above, they may partake in the Three Realms; below, they may wander the ten directions, guiding and instructing all beings, teaching and transforming the unenlightened, leading and uplifting the multitude, universally enabling them to attain the Dao—this is the work of the true person.

For those who study the Dao and recite this scripture—"reciting" means reading from the text, while "upholding" means reciting from memory. If practitioners of the Dao maintain a righteous heart, their devotion to the Dao unwavering, and cultivate in accordance with the method as if facing the Most High, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, always holding fast to singular focus—this is what is meant by "reciting and upholding." They will then be protected by the ten heavenly benevolent spirits.

This explains that if scholars constantly contemplate the Dao and recite the true scriptures, they will be shielded by benevolent spirits. The "ten heavens" refer to the eight directions, above and below. The *Sutra of Causes and Conditions* states: "Each month, on the ten straight days of purification, benevolent spirits preside over each day—these are also benevolent spirits."

Moreover, humans possess the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, as well as the six roots of the sensory faculties—thus the ten evils arise. The ten evils are: lust, killing, stealing, jealousy, deceit, anger, harsh speech, divisive speech, false speech, and frivolous speech. The ten virtues are: the body does not act recklessly, the heart does not stir recklessly, the mind does not think recklessly, the nature is not recklessly disturbed, the ears do not recklessly listen to improper sounds, the mouth does not recklessly utter frivolous speech, the eyes do not recklessly gaze upon improper sights, the nose does not recklessly inhale foul odors, the tongue does not recklessly taste improper flavors, and the consciousness does not recklessly entertain fear—these are called the twelve virtues.

When the ten virtues arise, the ten evils naturally vanish, and one is protected by the true sages. When the ten practices are complete, one naturally attains purity. With purity, there is no affliction. Without affliction, one accomplishes the true Dao. Then, the jade talismans and treasure spirits refine the form with golden liquid, and when form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth.

The "jade talisman" refers to the talisman of the Jade Emperor. When a practitioner of the Dao perfects their merit and fulfills their conduct, ascending the ranks of immortality, they first receive the Jade Emperor’s talismanic decree before ascending as an immortal. Regarding the jade talisman in relation to the body, it clarifies the affairs of the Middle Origin. The Middle Origin is the heart. If the practitioner’s heart can remain tranquil, it will naturally be unstained by worldly defilements, preserving purity and securing the form and spirit.

If those of the highest rank awaken to the Dao of refining golden liquid, they may solidify their physical form. Those of middling attainment, not yet awakened, seek elixirs outside the body, compounding and refining them to preserve their nature and life. As for the Dao of exiting and entering, one must first secure the physical form, then nurture the spirit and consciousness. When the form is secure, even if the body grows emaciated and strength wanes, the spirit remains its master. When the master is at peace, the exterior is secure. For example, a house in the world without occupants cannot remain intact—such is the principle of inner and outer affairs.

Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "My body is the chariot of the spirit, the abode of the spirit, the master of the spirit. When the master is tranquil, the spirit dwells within; when restless, the spirit departs." It further says: "The spirit gives birth to the form, and the form completes the spirit. Without the spirit, the form cannot live; without the form, the spirit cannot be perfected. When form and spirit unite, they mutually generate and mutually complete one another." This is the principle of inner and outer correspondence.

It also states: "The spirit constantly loves humanity, but humanity does not love the spirit." The spirit constantly loves humanity because it wishes for their life. Humanity does not love the spirit because the heart is disturbed. The heart is also spirit, and this spirit is called the "Numinous Youth." It can be evil or good, dull or bright, joyful or angry, upright or crooked. It drives the mind like a horse in the wind and the heart like an arrow in flight, crafting a thousand schemes and devising ten thousand strategies—all within this spirit.

The *Scripture of Inner Contemplation* also states: "The heart is the spirit. It is neither blue nor white, neither red nor yellow, neither large nor small, neither short nor long, neither curved nor straight, neither soft nor hard, neither thick nor thin, neither round nor square. Its transformations are unfathomable, blending yin and yang."

The vast encompasses heaven and earth, the minute enters the tip of a hair. Restrain it and it halts; release it and it rages. In clarity and stillness it lives, in turbidity and agitation it perishes. If one can attain clarity and stillness, cultivate the supreme Dao within, and subdue the heart, the heart becomes tranquil, and the spirit is born. When the spirit is born, the form is stabilized; when the form is stabilized, the spirit is perfected. The spirit relies on the form to be perfected, and the form relies on the spirit to be born. Form and spirit depend on each other—through tranquil cultivation and practice, the form is stabilized and the spirit is preserved. Thus it is said: when form and spirit are both wondrous, inner and outer correspond, and one naturally unites with the Dao in truth.

The preceding elucidates the power of recitation and upholding, refining and attaining perfection. This clarifies the preciousness of the true scripture’s virtue and power—when worldly people comprehend its profound subtleties, they transcend the Three Realms in body.

The Perfected of Orthodox Unity states: "Orthodox" means true; "Unity" means great, and also refers to the heart. The heart is the symbol of the southern great yang, yet its origin lies in the northern direction. Why does the great yang reside in the north? Because within Kan and Li there is a single line, thus it is called the one yang—this is the heart. One is the yang position within yin, and two is the yin position within yang. This is the principle of the Five Phases’ reversal and the function of yin-yang transformation—this is called Orthodox Unity.

The Perfected of Orthodox Unity is the Celestial Master of the Han, surnamed Zhang, named Daoling. Today, he serves as the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, holding the position of the Perfected of Orthodox Unity, and also as the Master of Salvation of the Three Clarities. This Perfected now resides in the rank of sagely perfected ones. He once refined the Five Phases, cultivated merit for the state, supported the declining, rescued the suffering, eliminated harm, fostered life, and benefited the common people. With merits complete and conduct fulfilled, he transcended the near and attained sagehood, occupying the exalted position of the Perfected of Orthodox Unity.

If one can refine the heart, naturally the palaces of the body will be unobstructed, the spirit harmonized, and qi unimpeded—all through the practice of Orthodox Unity. Today, there exist the Celestial Master’s methods of Orthodox Unity for slaying demons, the Three-Five Flying Steps, bronze talismans and iron charters, the precious scriptures of the Golden Elixir, secret formulas and numinous chapters, and the twenty-four ranks of registers—these are not enumerated one by one here.

When a household possesses this scripture, those who comprehend it will be untouched by calamities and obstructions, and all sages will guard the gate. The "household" is the body; the "scripture" is the heart. External learning is likened to the household residence.

The Perfected says: If a household possesses this scripture and one can comprehend its profound subtleties, still the body and heart, cultivate and uphold the Dao, and recite without retreat, then all sagely spirits and divine beings will protect the gate. With divine beings guarding the gate, calamities and obstructions will not afflict the household, and evil demons will not invade the dwelling—all because the master is clear and still, thus the divine luminaries guard the gate.

This inner analogy likens the household to the body, and the heart to the scripture. If one can attain clarity and stillness, practicing the supreme Dao within the heart, this is called possessing this scripture. "Comprehension" means awakening; "attainment" means understanding; "penetration" means realization. Awakening and realization mean the heart possesses the scripture. Without the scripture, one has not awakened or understood, hence calamities and obstructions arise from afflictions. If the heart is enlightened and attains understanding, there are no afflictions. With afflictions gone, clarity and stillness naturally prevail, calamities and obstructions do not arise, and thus they do not intrude.

When all sages guard the gate, within the human body there are thirty-six thousand spirits: three hun on the left, seven po on the right. The body has twelve thousand forms and shadows, the frame possesses twenty-four thousand essences of radiance, and the five viscera and six bowels have twenty-four spirits—even the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose each have their own. Each resides in its own palace. If one is clear and still, all spirits return to the body and each dwells in its palace—thus it is said that all sages guard the gate. Moreover, the thirty-six thousand spirits each reside in jade palaces, confirming that the words of Master Yanluo are not empty.

When the spirit ascends to the upper realms, it pays homage to the exalted ones. The spirit is the heart. The Daoist canon states: "Intelligent, bright, upright, and direct is called spirit; unfathomable in yin and yang is called sage." Thus, when the heart is numinous, the Dao descends; when the Dao descends, the spirit is numinous; when the spirit is numinous, it is sagely. When the spirit is sagely and luminous, it can ascend. "Ascend" means to ascend and reach the upper realms. The "upper realms" refer to the Three Clarities’ realm above the Three Realms, the Great Canopy Heaven.

If one can preserve essence, nurture qi, cherish the spirit, harmonize with primordial qi, replenish the brain, refine the spirit-water, transform and refine the spirit, and when spirit and qi are complete, one will ascend beyond the Three Realms to pay homage to the Most High and Exalted. Among those who study immortality, what is called "paying homage to the origin" has two aspects: one concerns heaven and earth, the other the human body.

This clarifies the three cinnabar fields. As for "paying homage to the origin" in the Three Realms, these are the upper, middle, and lower origins. The upper origin corresponds to Jade Clarity, transformed by the primordial qi, named the Heavenly Treasure Lord. It governs the Jade Clarity Sagely Realm of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, presiding over the twelve divisions of sagely conduct scriptures as the Master of the Cavern of Truth. Within the human body, it corresponds to the upper cinnabar field, the Palace of the Brain, also called the Palace of Muddy Pellet, ruled by the Sovereign Lord, governing qi.

The middle origin corresponds to Upper Clarity, transformed by the original qi, named the Numinous Treasure Lord. It governs the Upper Clarity Realm of the Yu-Yu Heaven, presiding over the twelve divisions of true conduct scriptures as the Master of the Cavern of Mystery. Within the human body, it corresponds to the middle cinnabar field, the Scarlet Palace of the Heart, ruled by the Sovereign Lord, governing the spirit.

The lower origin corresponds to Supreme Clarity, transformed by the mysterious qi, named the Divine Treasure Lord. It governs the Supreme Clarity Immortal Realm of the Great Red Heaven, presiding over the twelve divisions of immortal conduct scriptures as the Master of the Cavern of Spirit. Within the human body, it corresponds to the lower cinnabar field, the Sea of Qi in the Kidney Palace, ruled by the Sovereign Lord, governing life.

These three origins, three palaces, and three treasures—heaven and earth obtain them to be established and lose them to collapse; the human body obtains them to live and loses them to die. Thus, the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: "The spirit and essence of the body—guard them carefully, never lose them."

Thus, one must cherish and protect them.

It is also said: "Immortal adepts and Daoist masters are not divine by nature—they accumulate essence and amass qi to attain perfection." For all who study the Dao, if they can refine and employ their vital essence, visualize spirit and qi, pay homage to the Three Origins, and persist in their practice without retreat, they will naturally attain the true Dao after long cultivation. Thus, the sages declare: "The heart commands qi and spirit; if one knows how to guide the master of qi, one becomes an immortal." This clarifies the method of visualization, wherein all is directed by the heart.

When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one resonates with the Sovereign Lords. Through unwavering recitation and devotion, the body ascends upon purple clouds. This describes the fruition of Daoist practice.

When merit reaches eight hundred and conduct fulfills three thousand—merit and conduct here refer to the achievements of cultivation—if a practitioner can master the art of embryonic breathing, performing eight hundred cycles daily, they may ascend to heaven. Through the resonance of merit and conduct, they will naturally rise.

The ancients said: "When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, one ascends as a minister of the Golden Towers, walking alone upon the Jade Capital as a perfected adept."

If a practitioner can focus on the Three Palaces, pay homage to the True Origin, the hundred joints and gates of the body will naturally open and harmonize, while the myriad spirits will be at peace.

Resonating with the Sovereign Lords occurs when one guards and visualizes the Three Origins, each of which is presided over by a Sovereign Lord. Unwavering recitation and devotion ensure the mind remains aligned with the true Dao—this is the practice of recitation.

Ascending upon purple clouds follows the proper method of inner contemplation. Humans possess five viscera corresponding to the five phases. If one cultivates the five phases, true qi permeates the five viscera, filling the abdomen. Once the true qi of the five viscera is perfected, one naturally undergoes liberation from the corpse, moving freely between existence and non-existence, transformation and spontaneity, presence and absence—this is the attainment of the Dao.

Purple clouds are formed from the coalescence of the five phases' true qi, embodying the celestial decree of ascent. Thus, all who attain the Dao depart riding purple clouds, ascending to the Three Realms to pay homage to the Most High and Exalted One, signifying the noble realization of the perfected adept.
