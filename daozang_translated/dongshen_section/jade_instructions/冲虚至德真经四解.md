*The Fourfold Exegesis of the Perfect Scripture of the Dao of Primal Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*

**Title:** *The Fourfold Exegesis of the Perfect Scripture of the Dao of Primal Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*
Compiled by Gao Shouyuan of the Jin dynasty, completed circa the *yiyou* year of the Dading era (1185). Twenty fascicles.

**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Yujue* category.

**Liezi**
Liezi, surnamed Lie, personal name Yukou, was a native of Zheng. He dwelt in the Zheng gardens for forty years, yet no one recognized him. Initially, he studied under Master Huqiu, later became a disciple of the Old Master Shang, and befriended Master Bogao. Having mastered the Way of these two masters, after nine years he could ride the wind and travel. His disciple Yan Hui asked: "Is the purpose of seeking the Dao for wealth?" Liezi replied: "Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Dao, hence their downfall."

His work comprises eight pian. Liezi was a man of the Dao, and Zhuangzi frequently praised him. Today, the Liezi Temple in Bianliang, Zhengzhou, and Putian stands on the site of his former retreat. During the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Person of Primal Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue, and his work was titled *The Perfect Scripture of the Dao of Primal Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*.

Sima Qian, in his account of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, placed them before the Six Classics, thereby demonstrating his reverence for the arts of the Dao. Why, then, did he omit *Liezi*? Liu Xiang later collated and edited the text, which elucidates inner and outer truths, verifies life and death, and harmonizes self and other—largely in accord with Master Meng of Zhuang. Even the passages on "not knowing whether I ride the wind or the wind rides me," or "Zhou becoming a butterfly, the butterfly becoming Zhou," seem as though spoken from a single mouth.

Yet among later commentators and transmitters, few engaged with *Liezi*. In the Jin dynasty, there was Zhang Zhan; in the Tang, Lu Chongxuan. Compared to the *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi], Zhang Zhan is like Guo Xiang, and Lu Chongxuan like Cheng Xuanying.

By the Zhenghe era of the Song dynasty, there were exegeses, and Fan Zhixu (style name Qian Shu) of the Left Auxiliary also produced a commentary. At that time, the empire established Daoist learning, with teaching and nurturing methods equal to those of the Three Halls’ *jinshi*. The Confucian minister Wang Li memorialized: "The two works *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* are the wings of the Old Master [Laozi], just as Yan [Hui] and Meng [Zi] are to Confucius. Their subtle words and wondrous principles enlighten later generations, restoring the resplendent Way of the Yellow Emperor—a merit no less than that of Yan and Meng. It is fitting that the court order officials to deliberate on how to honor and esteem them." The court assented, and thus the text gained widespread circulation.

In Pingyang, the reclusive scholar Gao Shouyuan, styled Shanchang, collected two exegeses, combining them with the works of Zhang [Zhan] and Lu [Chongxuan] into a single volume. This truly enriches the learner, enabling one to knock at the gate of mystery and explore the threshold of the sages, attaining vastness while exhausting subtlety—how could this not be right? I have often reflected that the art of exegetical glossing has ever been difficult. Lu’s preface states: "A sage appears but once in a thousand years, and even then, they stand shoulder to shoulder; enlightenment dawns across ten thousand generations, yet it differs not from dawn to dusk." One cannot but sigh in lament.

In the third lunar month of the *jiyou* year of the Dading era, written by Mao Hui, Retired Gentleman for Meritorious Service, former Vice Prefect of Qinzhou, Cloud Rider Cavalier, and recipient of the *Feiyu* Fish Bag.

The newly compiled book is hereby finalized, comprising eight chapters.

The Protector of the Left Directorate of Waterways and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Minister Xiang, respectfully reports: The *Liezi* in the imperial archives consists of five chapters. Your minister Xiang, along with Minister Can, Magistrate of Changshe, collated three chapters from the Grand Temple archives, four from the Imperial Historiographer’s archives, six transcribed by your minister Xiang, and two by Minister Can—twenty chapters in total from both internal and external sources. After collation, twelve duplicate chapters were removed, leaving eight chapters definitively established. The imperial archives contain more, while external sources have fewer; passages are disordered and scattered across chapters, with frequent character errors—such as *jin* (exhaust) miswritten as *jin* (advance), or *xian* (worthy) as *xing* (form). In the newly compiled book, collation was conducted based on the imperial archives’ established text, all transcribed onto bamboo slips for fair copying.

*Liezi* was a native of Zheng and a contemporary of Duke Mu of Zheng, a man of the Dao. His learning derived from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he was numbered among the Daoists. The Daoists grasp the essential and hold to the root, embracing clarity, emptiness, and non-action. In cultivating the self and engaging with others, they esteem non-contention, aligning with the Six Classics. However, the chapters *King Mu* and *Tang’s Questions* are extravagant and fantastical, not the words of a noble person. As for the *Power and Fate* chapter, it wholly espouses Yangzi’s doctrine of predestined fate, valuing only unrestrained abandon—two doctrines at odds, unlike the work of a single school. Yet each has its insights, and there is much worth observing.

During the reign of Emperor Xiaojing, the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi flourished, and this book circulated widely. Later, it was lost and scattered among the people, with no transmitters. Moreover, it contains many parables, akin to those of Zhuang Zhou. Thus, the Grand Historian Sima Qian did not compose a separate biography for him, merely recording him in brief. Your minister Xiang, at the risk of death, respectfully submits the catalog of the *Liezi* collated by the Protector of the Left Directorate of Waterways and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Minister Xiang.

Presented on the *renyin* day of the eighth month in the third year of the Yongshi era.

Zhang Zhan of the Jin dynasty’s commentary and preface.

I have heard from my late father that my grandfather, along with Liu Zhengyu and Fu Yinggen, were all nephews of the Wang family, and in their youth, they studied under their maternal uncle, Wang Shizhou. Shizhou’s elder cousin, Wang Zhengzong, and his younger cousin, Wang Fusi, were both fond of collecting books. My grandfather and the others obtained nearly ten thousand scrolls from the family library of Wang Zhongxuan. The Fu family, too, had long been a scholarly household, and the three youths, in their childhood, vied to transcribe rare books. When they grew older, they encountered the chaos of the Yongjia era and fled south with Yinggen to escape the turmoil. Each carriage bore as much as its strength allowed, but with bandits and raiders growing ever more rampant and the road ahead still long, I said to Fu: "Now we cannot preserve all that we carry. Let us instead sort through what is most rare in the world, each safeguarding and recording what we must, so that nothing is lost." Thereupon, Yinggen took only the collected works of his ancestor Fu Xuan and his father Fu Xian. Among the books my grandfather had transcribed was the *Liezi* in eight scrolls. By the time they reached the south, only a few remained. Of the *Liezi*, only the scrolls *Yang Zhu*, *Explaining the Omen*, and the *Catalogue* survived. Later, during the upheaval, Zhengyu, who had become Inspector of Yangzhou, had already crossed the river and possessed four scrolls in his household. Soon after, I obtained six scrolls from the home of Fusi’s son-in-law, Zhao Jizi. Comparing and collating what was present and absent, the text was at last made complete. The general purport of the book is to clarify that all beings take ultimate emptiness as their fundamental principle, and that the myriad things are verified by their eventual dissolution. Spiritual wisdom is preserved in quiescent constancy and wholeness.

Reflections that cling to things bring about the loss of life, while wakefulness and transformation are as insubstantial as dreams—whether great or small, they are not confined to a single realm; success or failure does not depend on wisdom or effort. In cultivating the self, the highest value lies in unrestrained spontaneity. Follow one’s nature, and wherever one goes is fitting; one may tread upon water or fire. Forget all concerns, and nothing, however hidden, remains unilluminated. Such is the essence of this work.

Yet what it elucidates often intersects with Buddhist scriptures, while its fundamental return aligns with Laozi and Zhuangzi. Its diction and allusions bear a marked resemblance to the *Zhuangzi*. Zhuangzi, Shen Dao, Han Fei, Shizi, and the *Huainanzi* all point toward the same end, frequently citing its words. Thus, I have annotated it accordingly.

**Preface and Discussion by Lu Chongxuan, Tang Court Gentleman for Miscellaneous Affairs**

Liu Xiang said: Liezi was a man of Zheng who lived contemporaneously with Duke Mu of Zheng. He was, in all likelihood, a man of the Dao. His learning originated with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and was called the Daoist school. The Daoist school grasps the essential and holds to the root, embracing clarity, emptiness, and non-action. In governing the self and engaging with things, it esteems non-contention and aligns with the Six Classics. However, the chapters *King Mu* and *Tang’s Questions* are extravagant and fantastical, not the words of a noble person. As for the *Power and Fate* chapter, it entirely defers to destiny, while the *Yangzi* chapter values only unrestrained freedom. These two doctrines contradict one another and do not resemble the work of a single school. Nevertheless, each has its insights, and there is much worth observing. Moreover, it abounds in parables, much like the *Zhuangzi*. For this reason, Sima Qian, the Grand Historian, did not write a separate biography for him.

Zhang Zhan’s preface states: The general purport of the book is to clarify that all beings take ultimate emptiness as their fundamental principle, and that the myriad things are verified by their eventual dissolution. Spiritual wisdom is preserved in quiescent constancy and wholeness. Reflections that cling to things bring about the loss of life; wakefulness and transformation are as insubstantial as dreams—whether great or small, they are not confined to a single realm; success or failure does not depend on wisdom or effort. In cultivating the self, the highest value lies in unrestrained spontaneity. Follow one’s nature, and wherever one goes is fitting; one may tread upon water or fire. Forget all concerns, and nothing, however hidden, remains unilluminated. Such is its essence. Yet what it elucidates often intersects with Buddhist scriptures, while its fundamental return aligns with Laozi and Zhuangzi.

I, Chongxuan, consider the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi to have expounded the Dao for ages, yet no one in later generations has truly understood them. All attempt to discern their true essence through the distinctions of emotion and intellect, but though their explanations may be many, they all lead to incomprehension. Though their expositions may be numerous, they merely elaborate upon the dregs, invariably pointing toward the great Dao’s profound remoteness within the vast emptiness. The essence of the Dao is subtle and wondrous, transcending all speech. To expound upon it is to obscure its true nature, leaving only empty words; the ultimate principle of emptiness and nothingness is preserved in speech alone, yet people fail to realize that the Dao arises from within the self. They borrow words to explain it, forgetting that one must grasp the meaning and abandon the words, seek realization beyond language, and yet they remain entangled in the discriminating thoughts of birth and extinction, moved by the vulgar heart of emotional activity. They pride themselves on the flowery adornments of the Dao, seeking fame at the cost of substance.

Our August Emperor of Kaiyuan, Sagely in Culture, Divine in Martial Prowess, knows that the Dao is the root of life and that the highest virtue transcends words. He has broadly summoned scholars from the four directions and inquired widely of the myriad regions, hoping to find one who has grasped its profound principles, that he might succor all living beings. I, a humble servant of limited understanding, have by chance come to admire this Dao. Having twice received the sagely decree, I have re-examined its subtle words. Respectfully tracing the text of the *Liezi*, I have annotated its essential teachings, though my wisdom is meager. This is not an attempt to provide a guide; if by chance I might silently align with the subtle and formless, like the dark pearl grasped by the one without conscious intent, it would be my greatest wish—though I dare not hope for it.

**Discussion:**
What, then, is life? It is the meeting of spirit and form.

What, then, is death? It is the parting of spirit and form. Form knows birth and death, but spirit knows neither death nor birth—thus Laozi says, "The valley spirit does not die," and "That which dies yet does not perish is longevity." Yet this birth and death pertain only to form; as for the function of spirit, there is no birth or death at all. Spirit is fundamentally empty and mysterious, and those who align with the true constitute its nature. Form is fundamentally substantial and obstructive, and those who are stained by it constitute its emotions. The perfected person forgets emotion and returns to nature, thus drawing near the Dao; the ordinary person, deluded, clings to nature and pursues emotion, thus losing the true. Therefore, to impair the limbs and dull the senses is the constant nature of those who follow the Dao; to crave life and fear death is the common sentiment of all things. Do not cling to love and thereby harm life, nor seek fame and thereby cast away the treasure. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: "In doing good, do not draw near to fame; in doing evil, do not draw near to punishment." "Follow the axis of the Dao as your constant," for by this one may nurture life and fulfill one's years. Yet later generations, believing that the absence of striving for fame allows the heart to indulge in evil, have strayed far from this truth. Why is this so?

When others laugh, one laughs; when others wail, one wails; what others fear, one cannot but fear—how then could one do evil? Thus we know the spirit is the master of life, while the form repays the spirit’s merit. The spirit possesses the power to aid beings, and the form receives the reward of honor and reverence; the spirit exerts the function of harming beings, and the reward takes the form of baseness and degradation. Therefore, the spirit’s movement is inexhaustible, while the form has its span of long or short; when the reward is exhausted, death ensues, and when merit is manifest, new life arises. It is like the pure and upright ascending to glory, while the greedy and cruel descend in demotion. Speaking in terms of rank, if the form does not change, the station differs; speaking in terms of the spirit, if the spirit remains unaltered, the form transforms. The perfected person fully comprehends this Way and thus possesses and treasures the true. The true spirit has no form, and the mind’s wisdom is its function—this function may be defiled or pure. The distinction between the common and the sage lies here: those submerged in defilement become common, while those abiding in purity become one with the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance; one need only depart from emotion—how could it be sought in the depths of obscurity or discerned beyond the realm of the indistinct? Thus *Laozi* says: "My Way is most easy to know, most easy to practice, yet none can know it, none can practice it. Why is this so?" Later generations merely regard the form as life, not knowing the spirit is the master of life; they regard qi as death, not knowing the spirit is the root of qi. Attachment to form gives rise to emotion, and delusion about the spirit causes one to lose the Dao. Bound to what confuses the root, drowned in what destroys the return, they forget the way back. The sage laments their stubborn clinging and sighs that those who know the Dao are not easily encountered. Thus it is said: "A worthy in a thousand *li* is like a neighbor; one who knows the Way in ten thousand generations is no different from one in the morning or evening"—how deeply to be pitied! Is it not so?

Should one take this discourse to heart, relinquishing emotions and intellect to return to the root, diminishing again and again until acting through non-action, then upon reading the book of *Liezi*, one may have already grasped more than half of its profound meaning.

*Preface to the Zhenghe Commentary*
The Dao flows through the myriad things, yet things are confined to a single corner. The people of the world see things but not the Dao; the sage sees that nothing in things is not the Dao. Thus truth and falsehood stand apart, dream and waking are distinguished, being and non-being are discerned, and past and present diverge. Those who attain do not rely on wisdom; those who lose are not due to folly—yet the disparity between success and failure arises from the mismatch of effort and fate. Those who act for themselves abandon benevolence; those who act for others abandon righteousness—and the words of Yang Zhu and Mo Di are ridiculed by masters of the great Way. Yet *Liezi* transcends truth and falsehood, unites being and non-being in one principle, and leaves gain and loss, success and failure to their natural course. He embraces self-interest and universal love alike, achieving great harmony, while deeply pitying the delusion of the people. They see profit and forget their true nature—like thieves, like those who snatch gold—deluded without return, rushing headlong without a backward glance. Thus he composed eight chapters to reveal the wondrous workings of the spirit, which moves freely beyond all bounds, and the ever-victorious Dao that holds fast to the rear and guards softness in the realm of non-contention. His teachings are vast and unbridled, drawing on external discourses and attributing words to the Yellow Emperor and Confucius. Yet in essence, they all trace back to the intent of the *Daodejing*. However, when we examine his words, probe his meaning, and investigate his attainments—seeing how he was entranced by spirit-mediums, prostrated himself before Bo Hun Wu Ren’s archery—we find that his progress in the Dao culminated only in riding the wind home. Thus he remains far from Zhuang Zhou.

*Zhuangzi* says: "Liezi rode the wind and traveled, yet still relied on something." Alas! To be swift without haste, to arrive without moving—only the utmost spirit of the world, the true embodiment of the Old Master, achieves this. In the intervals of my myriad duties, having already studied the *Five Thousand Characters* and composed annotations for them, and having also commented on the *Zhuangzi*’s *Inner Chapters*, I could not leave the book of *Liezi* without a proper account. Thus I offer these explanations based on what I have heard, awaiting the understanding of future sages.

*Preface written on the first day of the intercalary ninth month of the Wuxu year of the Zhenghe era.*

*Preface by Fan Zuo Cheng, Left Assistant Minister, Wu Shizhong*
What the world values is the written word, yet writing is but speech. What is valued in speech is meaning, and meaning has its source. Those who grasp the meaning may forget the words. Those who fail to grasp the meaning not only misvalue what should be valued but also stand in disorder, collectively rejecting it—how can they be worthy of discussing the great Way?

*Liezi* was a man of virtue from the state of Zheng. Observing his teachings and discourses, one sees his elucidation of the principles of nature and destiny, and his salvific, medicinal words for the world—surpassing all other masters. Beyond words and meaning, he generally took the Primal Origin as his foundation. In his choice of phrases and analogies, he galloped alongside *Zhuangzi*. Yet vulgar scholars and worldly teachers, constrained by names and things, unable to transcend their rigid views, sought only within narrow bounds and thus rejected him as beyond sagacity and wisdom. Even Sima Qian, who especially revered Daoist learning, did not include him in his *Records*; Liu Xiang, erudite and well-versed, collator of books, dismissed the *King Mu* and *Tang’s Questions* chapters as absurd and fantastical, unworthy of a gentleman, and thus rejected and condemned them. Was this not because they failed to grasp the source of his meaning and lost sight of what should be valued?

I have observed the *Zhenghe Commentary* and seen how, in later ages, it exalts the Daoist teachings, aiming to guide the people of the world back to the feelings of their nature and destiny and restore the Great Ancestry—what a profound bestowal! Thus, it commanded scholars of the imperial academy to study the Daoist scriptures alongside their regular texts. Under the hands of great masters, the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi shone like the sun and stars. Those who read and were transformed found their models and could no longer engage in idle debate.

As for the book of *Liezi*, Zhang Zhan once provided a commentary, but its errors and inconsistencies were severe. Not only did it fail to grasp the method of exposition, but it also missed the essence of the text, which has long troubled scholars. Thus, those who truly grasp the meaning of this book, though they may wish to forget words, how could they?

Left Assistant Minister Fan, Master Taichu, in the midst of harmonizing governance, personally provided annotations, expounding the meaning as if it sprang from *Liezi*’s own mind. His explanations suffice to dispel the obstructions of learners. Subtle words and wondrous Dao, after thousands of years, are suddenly made clear—like parting clouds and mist to behold the blue sky. Those who read his book will grasp its meaning in an instant, without even leaving their seats. Thus, its contribution to our sovereign’s way of transforming the world is of boundless benefit. Therefore, I have overseen its carving to broaden its transmission, and respectfully place this preface at the beginning of the volume.

*Written on the full moon of the first autumn month of the first year of the Xuanhe era.*

*The Four Commentaries on the Perfect Book of Profound Virtue, Volume One*
Commentaries by Zhang Zhan of the Jin, Lu Chongxuan (Vice Director of Communications) of the Tang,
*Zhenghe Commentary* of the Song, and Fan Zhixu (Left Assistant Minister) of the Song.
Compiled by He Guang Sanren, Gao Shouyuan.

Zhang observes: How can great and small be at odds, or long and short differ in nature? Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad beings numerous, all that falls within the realm of living things and pertains to the domain of activity and function is governed by the natural signs of life, death, and transformation. Only that which is utterly still and supremely empty, concentrated in oneness and unchanging, lies beyond the cycles of yin and yang or the shifts of the four seasons.

Xu comments: All moving beings take life as their master, yet they cling to life without understanding the principle of life begetting life. That which undergoes generation and transformation is the realm of form; that which begets life is formless. Form belongs to things; the formless is called spirit. It may be employed like yin and yang, yet in its true nature, it eludes the grasp of yin and yang. Thus, the *Book of Changes* states: "That which yin and yang cannot fathom is called spirit." Is this not the great numinous portent at the heart of heaven and earth? Hence, it is called *Heavenly Portents*.

The *Zhenghe Commentary* explains: Things undergo generation and transformation, but the Dao knows no past or present. Only those who embody the Dao can remain unchanging while responding to things, without harboring intentions. Thus, *Heavenly Portents* begins with generation and transformation and concludes with Guoshi’s act of thievery.

Fan remarks: Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, all flow into the realm of life and death, all fall into the mechanism of emergence and withdrawal. They follow one another in cycles of beginning and end, succeed one another in transformations, and in life and death, long life and early demise, gain and loss, fulfillment and deficiency—none escapes the natural signs. Those who embody the Dao transcend the world of things, rising above the domain where the ten thousand forms flow and turn, merging with the unchanging source of singular nature. Day and night cannot enslave them, yin and yang cannot mold them, and thus they master things without being mastered by things.

The *Liezi* places the character *zi* (Master) above the surname, suggesting that the opening chapter may have been recorded by a disciple. He dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. Not mingling in form with things, nor engaging in speech with them, they remained unaware of his utmost virtue, as if he were unknown. Lords, ministers, and great officials regarded him as they would the common folk. Not that he isolated himself from things, but his words bore no judgments, his actions left no traces—thus, things could not comprehend him.

The *Zhenghe Commentary* states: The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—so deep as to be unfathomable.

Fan says: The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—so deep as to be unfathomable. Thus, they embraced their nature and held fast to spirit, wandering among the common world, flowing with things and moving with their currents. How could they ever adorn their wisdom to astonish the foolish or strive to set themselves apart from the world and its customs?

When the state suffered famine and dearth, he prepared to depart for Wei. To leave one’s home is called "marrying out."

Xu notes: "Insufficiency" refers to famine. "Marrying out" means to go forth.

A disciple said: Master, you depart without a set time for return. Dare we make a request?

Lu explains: *Ye* (谒) means "to request."

What teaching will you leave us?

The Master had not heard the words of Huqiu Zilin?

Huqiu Zilin was Liezi’s teacher.

Liezi laughed and said: What did Master Hu say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born—do they require words?

Fan remarks: The "pot" (*hu*) is empty yet indestructible; the "mound" (*qiu*) is firm and unmoving. *Zilin* (Master Lin) embodies the mother of the Dao, ruling all under heaven. The Dao cannot be questioned, and questions receive no answer. Those who embody the Dao silently comprehend it, needing no words. To speak much is to stray far from the Dao.

Nevertheless, the Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren, and I overheard it. Let me try to tell you.

Bohun was Liezi’s friend, a fellow student under Huzi. That he did not say he received teaching directly from Huzi reflects Liezi’s humility.

The *Zhenghe Commentary* states: The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak of it is to miss it. Then what did Huzi say? Only when unavoidable did he speak, and so I heard and now tell you.

Fan says: The Dao cannot be spoken; to speak of it is to miss it. Yet in the end, he could not avoid words. This is because his "wordless words" were never truly spoken. In this case, he spoke only to convey the broad outlines for you.

Bohun Maoren embodied the Dao and became a thing, perpetually preserving his radiance and concealing his brilliance, leaving nothing to be seen. Some called him "the man of no-thing." From the perspective of one who stands apart from the world and accompanies heaven, this is what Huqiu Zilin meant when he spoke to him. The Dao cannot be heard, nor can it be told. Thus, when he heard it, he said, "I overheard it"; when he told it, he said, "Let me try to tell you."

His words were: There is life that does not live, transformation that does not transform. This inert form of ours is born by things yet does not birth itself; it exists in change and alteration, transforming things yet does not transform itself.

Lu says: Not born by things, not transformed by things, it can thus give life to all living things and transform all transformations. That which does not live can give life to life; that which does not live is the origin of all living things. That which does not transform can transform transformations; that which does not transform is the master of all transformations. That which lives cannot but live; that which transforms cannot but transform. The living do not live by their own power, nor do the transforming transform by their own power—they simply cannot but live, cannot but transform.

Lu says: All that has life must die. Those transformed by things are ever-shifting; how can they be without life or death, without transformation or change? Thus, they are ever-living, ever-transforming. All that falls within the realm of movement cannot be without it for even a moment. Ever-living, ever-transforming—they are never without life, never without transformation. Life and transformation follow one another; existence and annihilation, presence and absence, alternate without end.

Fan says: The spirit’s mechanism and the mother of qi rise and fall, enter and exit. From the wriggling of insects to the fluttering of winged creatures, all dwell within the realm of generation and transformation. Only those who are not things yet master things can give life without being bound by life, transform without being bound by transformation.

That which is generated by generation depends on this to be generated and cannot but be generated—thus it is ever-generating, without any moment when it is not generating. That which is transformed by transformation depends on this to transform and cannot but transform—thus it is ever-transforming, without any moment when it is not transforming. How could one tread upon form and yet transcend the realm of generation and transformation? To be neither generated nor transformed is to merge with the profound sameness of the Dao/Way—this is called the Perfected Person.

Yin and yang, the four seasons—yin and yang, the four seasons, the things of change and transformation—all belong to the realm of the generated, following this shaping and revolving. The four seasons shift without ceasing; the myriad things transform without rest.

Fan says: All that are shifted by yin and yang, turning with the seasons, are things of form. Moment by moment they shift and transform, their life and death endless—thus they are ever-generating, ever-transforming. The ungenerated is called "solitary." How could the generation of the ungenerated be verified in reality? It is suspected of being obscurely one, without beginning or end.

Fan says: The spirit has no fixed comparison, hence it is called "solitary." Laozi says: "Solitary, it stands alone and does not change." "Suspected" means not daring to speak decisively to clarify what is profoundly wondrous. The untransformed moves to and fro—its boundary cannot be exhausted. Alternation without gap, the succession of forms and qi—its Dao/Way does not end. Suspected of being solitary, its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed. How could one know whether it is fathomable or not? One simply suspects that it stands alone and does not change, circulating without end.

Fan says: The changes of the four seasons cannot be exhausted; the functioning of the spirit and its transformations cannot be fathomed.

*Zhenghe* states: Generation arises from nonbeing to become being; transformation proceeds from being to become nonbeing. That which is generated and transformed is a thing; that which is neither generated nor transformed is the Dao/Way. Things are bound by number, thus the generated cannot but generate, the transformed cannot but transform. The Dao/Way moves through things, thus it is ever-generating, ever-transforming, without any moment when it is not generating, without any moment when it is not transforming. Standing alone above the myriad things, thus the ungenerated is suspected of being solitary, responding without exhaustion. Thus the untransformed moves to and fro—its boundary cannot be exhausted. For none know its beginning or end. Suspected of being solitary, its Dao/Way cannot be fathomed. For it cannot be fully investigated. No thing can pair with it—how could one truly know its reason? One can only suspect it.

Fan says: Yin and yang illuminate, cover, and govern one another; the four seasons replace, generate, and destroy one another. Who directs this? Who maintains its order? Is there a mechanism that ceaselessly operates? Or does it revolve without being able to stop itself? Yin and yang do not depart from qi; the four seasons do not escape from number—thus they cannot transcend the realm of generation and transformation. The true essence of the Dao/Way stands alone and does not change. Because it does not generate itself, it can endure forever. The wondrous functioning of the Dao/Way circulates without end. That which daily transforms with things is the one that does not transform. To transform things without being transformed is to command the transformation of things while alone preserving its origin. Thus, the boundary of no-boundary, the beginning and end returning to no beginning—who knows where it ends? To generate things without being generated is to exist before heaven and earth yet not be long-lasting. Thus, the image of no-thing—none can pair with it—who knows where it ends?

*The Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: "The valley spirit does not die." This ancient book once existed, but now it is no longer extant. The valley is empty yet houses being—just as Zhuangzi speaks of the "ring’s center." Utterly empty of things, thus it is called the valley spirit; fundamentally without generation, thus it is said not to die. This is called the Mysterious Female.

Laozi has a chapter on this. Wang Bi’s commentary says: "Without form or shadow, without opposition or resistance, abiding in lowliness without moving, guarding stillness without decline. The valley completes it yet its form is not seen—this is the ultimate thing. Abiding in lowliness and unable to be named, thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Vague yet existing, its use is inexhaustible."

Wang Bi says: "Gate" refers to that through which the Mysterious Female operates. Tracing it to its origin, it shares the same body as the Great Ultimate—thus it is called the root of heaven and earth. If one wishes to say it exists, its form is not seen; if one wishes to say it is gone, the myriad things are generated by it—thus it is said to be "vague yet existing." No thing is not completed by it, yet it does not labor—thus it is called "without movement."

Fan says: The valley is empty, and qi resides within it; the form is empty, and the spirit dwells within it. "Mysterious" means wondrous and without form; "female" means responding without fixed direction. From birth to death, nothing does not depend on it—thus it is called the "gate." The root of all that has form—thus it is called the "root." Seen yet not visible, used without exhaustion—thus it is said to be "as if existing."

Fan says: The Yellow Emperor and Laozi both embodied the spirit and illuminated the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way is one alone—how could their words differ? Thus, the teachings of the valley spirit and the Mysterious Female appear in Laozi, while Liezi attributes them to *The Book of the Yellow Emperor*. The valley’s function has no appearance; the spirit’s essence has no fixed direction—it is that from which the myriad things receive their mandate. "Mysterious" is the color of heaven; "female" is the kind of earth—it is that from which the myriad things receive their forms. Though their names differ, in reality they are one thing. Heaven and earth are the above and below of the myriad things, yet the gate of the Mysterious Female is that through which even heaven and earth enter and exit. From its own root, from its own origin, existing since antiquity—it endures like the transmission of fire, yet its end is unknown. To generate generation without being generated, to transform transformation without being transformed, moving yet ever emerging—what labor is there in this? Thus, that which generates things is not generated; that which transforms things is not transformed.

*Zhuangzi* also contains these words. Xiang Xiu’s commentary says: "My generation is not generated by me—thus generation generates itself."

Does that which generates generation possess any thing? Thus, it does not generate. My transformation is not transformed by any thing—thus transformation transforms itself. Does that which transforms transformation possess any thing? It possesses no thing, thus it does not transform. If that which generates things were itself generated, and that which transforms things were itself transformed, then it would be transformed along with things—how would it differ from them? Only by illuminating the ungenerated and untransformed can one become the root of generation and transformation.

Lu says: This spirit is the master of generation, able to generate and transform things, yet no thing can generate or transform it. It generates itself, transforms itself, forms itself, colors itself, knows itself, empowers itself, diminishes itself, and ceases itself—all of its own accord. How could there be a master to preside over it? To speak of generation, transformation, form, color, knowledge, power, diminution, or cessation is mistaken. If there were a mind intent on generation, transformation, form, or color, how could it govern heaven and earth and contain the myriad things, overseeing all living beings without omission?

Lu says: The spirit’s solitary movement is not compelled by any thing. If it were bound by emotion and stagnation, becoming like the generation and transformation of things, this would not be the Dao.

*Zhenghe* says: The movement of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, the principles of the myriad things—suddenly they exist, suddenly they vanish. Form is real, color is manifest, knowledge and strategy arise, power is exerted, waxing and waning follow one another, ending only to begin again. Though nothing moves without change, and no time passes without shift, all abide in the Dao, yet their ceaseless turning is of their own accord.

Fan says: The things of the world are born from being, and being is born from non-being—thus no thing fails to be generated. Hidden transforms into manifest, manifest transforms into hidden—thus no thing fails to be transformed. Only the ungenerated and untransformed can serve as the source of generation and transformation. Thus, filling the space between heaven and earth, the living grow of themselves, the transforming succeed of themselves. Form divides from the Great Beginning, color emerges from the Great Simplicity. Knowledge varies in greatness, power in strength; some diminish and diminish, some cease and cease—all of their own accord. Who is it that acts upon them? Once there is intent in the mind, this is called not-Dao.

Master Liezi says: Of old, the sages relied on yin and yang to unify heaven and earth. Heaven and earth refer to the totality of forms; yin and yang clarify their measures and governing principles.

Lu says: All things with form have that by which they are generated and moved. The greatest of these is heaven and earth; that which moves heaven and earth is yin and yang. Yin and yang are the transformations of qi, without substance or form. Heaven and earth rely on them to manifest life and death. Yin and yang are easily distinguished, but the spirit’s discernment is difficult to fathom. Borrowing one to illustrate the other serves as an analogy. Only then can one know that the spirit governs form, and that being does not give rise to being.

Fan says: To "unify things" means to bind them in relation; that which is unified permeates them. Heaven moves above, earth rests below, and the sage stands between them. How could this suffice to unify them? Yet here lies the Dao: above, it reaches heaven; below, it coils through earth. It completes, assists, encompasses, and shapes—nothing lies beyond it. Thus, by relying on yin and yang to unify them, heaven and earth, vast as they are, will not exceed the bounds of one’s measure.

Yangzi says: Exalting heaven, embracing earth, distinguishing groups, pairing things, ensuring they do not lose their unity—nothing is better than the ruler. That which has form is born from the formless. To call it "generated" is not to say it is not non-being; to call it "non-being" is not to say it does not generate. Thus, the non-mutual generation of being and non-being is a principle that stands as such. Then from what does being arise? Suddenly, it generates itself. Suddenly, it generates itself, yet knows not how it generates; not knowing how it generates, generation is fundamentally identical to non-being. Fundamentally identical to non-being, yet not non-being—this clarifies how the formed takes form of itself, without the formless shaping it. Then how do heaven and earth come to be? If heaven and earth have no source from which to be generated, they generate naturally.

Lu says: Heaven and earth are the greatest of forms. Yin and yang are not spirit or discernment. If that which has form is born from the formless, do heaven and earth possess spirit, discernment, mind, or nature? If they are formless, from what do they arise? This hypothetical question will clarify that the myriad things possess generation.

Fan says: Heaven and earth are the smallest things in the void, the greatest within being. Thus, they are confined within form alongside the myriad things. Tracing their origin, there must be that which existed before heaven and earth—what the *Book of Changes* calls the Supreme Ultimate.

Zhuangzi says: The luminous is born from the obscure; order is born from the formless. Thus, there is the Great Simplicity, the Great Beginning, the Great Inception, and the Great Simplicity. This clarifies how things progress from the subtle to the manifest, how transformations follow one another in succession.

Fan says: It has no body, no number, and is obscured by qi. Before form and substance separated, it was called the Great Simplicity. As for the Great Beginning, it had already begun to manifest in qi; as for the Great Inception, it had already divided into form; as for the Great Simplicity, it had already become manifest in substance. How could there be no origin to trace? The knife is what tailors the garment, yet when the knife is first used, there is no garment—this is merely the garment’s beginning. Thus, at the beginning of qi, it is named the Great Beginning. Only after the beginning is there an inception. The woman receives inception and gives birth; the terrace is begun and completed. That which gives birth is on the left, that which completes is on the right. Thus, at the beginning of form, it is named the Great Inception. Before it receives dye, it is unadulterated. Once dyed, it remains pure and does not contend with things. Thus, at the beginning of substance, it is named the Great Simplicity. These four progress from the subtle to the manifest, having already departed from non-being. Thus, they are spoken of in terms of being. The Great Simplicity has not yet revealed qi.

The term *yi* (易) signifies that which is inexhaustible and unobstructed. When it congeals in stillness within the realm of the Great Void, what can be perceived? This is akin to the *Taiji* of the *Yi*’s *Xici* or the "undifferentiated unity" of the Old Master. Fan states: There is yang qi, there is yin qi, and there is the harmonizing qi—all arise without movement. Before the Great *Yi*, qi has not yet appeared, let alone form and substance.

The Great Beginning (*Taichu*) is the inception of qi. Before yin and yang are distinguished, this is what the following phrase calls "undifferentiated unity." Fan states: In the Great Beginning, there is being and non-being, yet no name exists; it dwells in the indistinct and nebulous, transforming to give rise to qi. Thus, the Great Beginning is the inception of qi.

The Great Inception (*Taishi*) is the inception of form. Once yin and yang are distinguished, the myriad things flow into form. Fan states: The *Yi* says, "Qian knows the Great Inception." That which has an inception also has what precedes inception. What has an inception is called the Great Inception. Only when there is no inception of inception does the formation of all forms depend upon this as their origin.

The Great Simplicity (*Taisu*) is the inception of substance. Substance is nature. Once a thing exists, it possesses square or round, hard or soft, still or restless, sinking or floating—each with its own nature. Fan states: With qi and form, substance is complete; the manifestation of all colors arises from this.

When qi, form, and substance are present yet not yet separated, this passage discusses only qi, form, and substance, no longer mentioning the Great *Yi*. The Great *Yi* is the primordial origin of these three, which will be clarified in later passages. Fan states: The primordial qi of the *Taiji* contains the three as one. Thus, when qi, form, and substance are present yet not separated, it is called "undifferentiated unity." This is what the *Laozi* refers to as "the undifferentiated." Though appearances, images, sounds, and colors differ in ten thousand ways, all are contained within this. Hence, it is called "undifferentiated unity." Undifferentiated unity means the myriad things are intermingled yet not separated.

Though it is a single, undivided qi, the Way of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity) is already latent within it. *Lun* is an auxiliary particle. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—hence, it is called *yi*. *Yi* has no form or boundary. (The following character is unclear.) The *Laozi* says, "That which cannot be seen is called *xi*." Here, it is called *yi*, another name for *xi* in its simplicity.

The meaning of the Great *Yi* is thus: it serves as the primordial lord of the myriad transformations, obscurely one and unchanging. Fan states: Within undifferentiated unity, the three cannot be scrutinized. That which is colored is manifest, yet the source of color has never appeared—thus, it cannot be seen. That which is sounded is audible, yet the source of sound has never arisen—thus, it cannot be heard. That which is formed is tangible, yet the source of form has never existed—thus, it cannot be grasped. Such is this: I know not its name, so I style it *yi*.

*Yi* transforms into One. The so-called *yi* is profound and indistinct, beyond transformation. Qi relies upon it to transform, so it is provisionally named "transformation." One transforms into seven, seven transforms into nine. Nine transformations are the ultimate; the ultimate is the limit. The transformation of one into seven and nine does not follow sequential numbers but fully encompasses the yang numbers to summarize their convergence. It then transforms back into One. One is the inception of form’s transformation. Once it enters the realm of form, principle and number unfold from one to nine. When the nine numbers are exhausted, it returns to One. Returning to One is a reversion to the inception of form’s transformation, illustrating that transformation and change are ceaseless and boundless.

Fan states: The great image has no form—who can distinguish high from low? Descending into numerical reckoning, transformation arises from this. Thus, *yi* transforms into One—this is what is meant by "the Dao gives birth to One." The arising of One has what precedes form. Though it enters into numbers, it remains close to the Dao. Yet once it is called One, can it remain without transformation? Once it is named One, can it avoid transformation? Thus, seven and nine arise from the division and transformation of One, ensuring its inexhaustibility. Seven is the number of young yang; nine is the number of old yang. When numbers reach their limit, they are exhausted. Thus, nine transformations are the ultimate. When exhausted, they transform; when transformed, they flow. Thus, nine returns to One. One is the inception of form’s transformation. Beginning and end revert in an endless cycle, like a ring without seam. From this point onward, even the most skillful reckoning cannot calculate it.

That which is clear and light ascends to become Heaven; that which is turbid and heavy descends to become Earth. What are Heaven and Earth? They are merely the self-distinction of emptiness and fullness, clarity and turbidity. This entire chapter is from the *Qian Zaodu* of the *Zhou Yi*.

Fan states: Once undifferentiated unity is distinguished, the Three Powers commence their division. Heaven arches above, Earth sprawls below, and humanity dwells dazedly in between. Heaven is but accumulated qi—clear and light, belonging to yang. Earth is but accumulated mass—turbid and heavy, belonging to yin. Humanity receives the mean of Heaven and Earth to live, thus bearing yin and embracing yang, harmonizing with the harmonizing qi. The harmonizing qi gives rise to humanity. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and are born.

Extending this reasoning, yin and yang qi intermingle and harmonize; when qi harmonizes, humanity is born. Once humanity is born, it has something upon which to rely and stand. Lu states: One, three, five, seven, nine—these are the numbers of yang. When they reach their limit, they return to One, circulating endlessly. The *Yi* says: "That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward." That which inclines downward is the category of grasses and trees; that which inclines upward is the category of sentient beings. Thus, animals possess spirit, while plants lack consciousness.

Those without consciousness are transformed by qi; those with spirit are moved by consciousness. Thus, from *Taiyi* and *Dahuo* to the primordial chaos of *Hunlun*, this speaks of the gradual transformation of qi. Within it, the most refined and pure is called "spirit"; those whose spirit and qi are subtle become the worthy and the sagely, while those whose spirit and qi are turbid become the common and the foolish. Extending to all living things, their distinctions are manifold.

*Zhenghe* states: Yin and yang are the greatest of qi; Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms. When qi transforms and takes form, then there are yin and yang, and thereafter Heaven and Earth. The Dao/Way is their universal principle; the sage is the steward of the Dao/Way. This is how the sage governs Heaven and Earth through yin and yang.

The *Yi* speaks of the Supreme Polarity, which gives rise to the Two Modes. This is what *Zhuangzi* refers to when saying the Dao/Way exists prior to the Supreme Polarity. Thus, *Taiyi* is the state before qi is manifest, dwelling in the realm of boundless obscurity. When it transforms and qi arises, this is *Dahuo*, the beginning of qi. When qi transforms and takes form, this is *Taishi*, the beginning of form. When form differentiates and substance emerges, this is *Taisu*, the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, the full embodiment of the Dao/Way resides therein. Thus, it is said: *Hunlun* is what Laozi refers to as "the thing that is undifferentiated and complete."

With nothing to employ its clarity, it cannot be seen; with nothing to apply its hearing, it cannot be heard.

With nothing to gather its strength, it cannot be grasped. These three—seeing, hearing, and grasping—cannot be pursued through inquiry; thus, they merge into one. Yet once called "one," how could there be no discourse on it? This is why it is forcibly named *Yi* (Change).

*Yi* has no fixed form or boundary, for it has no body. When *Yi* is compared to yang, it is the origin of the One. Thus, it transforms into the One. Numbers arise from the One, so it transforms into seven—coiled yet not extended. Seven transforms into nine—intertwined and undergoing change. When numbers reach their limit at nine, they revert to the One. The One is the beginning of all transformations of form, and heaven, earth, and humanity all derive their existence from it. Thus, it is said: the pure and light ascends to become heaven; the turbid and heavy descends to become earth; the harmonious and balanced becomes humanity.

Essence is the One. The One gives rise to the Two, the Two to the Three, and the Three to the myriad things. Thus, heaven and earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.

Master Fan says: When yin and yang concentrate their essence, they become heaven and earth; when their essence scatters, they become the myriad things. Heaven and earth are the above and below of the myriad things. Things and heaven-earth have no inherent priority; when the sequence of the Great Dao is made clear, there is heaven and earth, and then the myriad things are born. Thus, the *Yijing* says: "Heaven and earth interact, and the myriad things are transformed and born."

Master Liezi says: Heaven and earth have no complete functions, the sage has no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses. "Complete" here means "exhaustive." Master Fan says: The great wholeness of the Dao is divided between above and below—this is how the positions of heaven and earth are established. That which fulfills the capacities of heaven and earth is the sage; that which fills the space between heaven and earth is the myriad things. Their functions of covering and supporting, their complementary abilities, and their diverse uses have never not relied upon one another—how could any possess the great wholeness in full?

Thus, heaven’s duty is to give life and cover; earth’s duty is to shape and bear; the sage’s duty is to teach and transform; and things’ duty is to fulfill what is fitting. "Duty" means "to preside over." Each life has its nature, and each nature has what is fitting for it. Master Fan says: Those with duties should heed their superiors.

Therefore, when the Three Powers are established in their positions and the myriad things are scattered in their diversity, all have their constant duties. Yet when one ascends beyond form, observes heaven and earth, and looks down upon the myriad things without sharing the sage’s concerns, what cannot be encompassed by sound has no part in it. Indeed, what duty could it possibly receive?

Thus, heaven has its shortcomings, earth has its strengths, the sage has its limitations, and things have their penetrations. That which is suited to one direction will be obstructed when applied elsewhere. Wang Bi says: Form must have its divisions, and sound must have its categories. For example, warmth cannot be cool, and the *gong* note cannot be the *shang* note.

Master Fan says: When the Three Powers are complete and the myriad things are divided, their uses have never not relied upon one another. Thus, what has shortcomings has strengths, and what has penetrations has limitations. Why? That which gives life and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot violate what is fitting. Compliance leads to penetration. What is fittingly determined does not exceed its position. All have their inherent allotments, which cannot be reversed.

Master Fan says: Heaven arches high and is strong and vigorous, covering all without fail, yet it cannot necessarily shape and bear. Earth is heavy and still, sustaining all without fail, yet it cannot necessarily teach and transform. The sage stands between them, observing above and below, participating with heaven and earth. Teaching is established by the self, and transformation is enacted by the self—only thus can one assist in heaven and earth’s transforming and nourishing. Yet how could the function of teaching and transformation violate what is fitting for things? Things have no constant fittingness; what is fitting lies in following the moment. I simply comply with their nature without disturbing their established patterns, allowing the myriad things to be born, each attaining what is fitting for it.

Thus, teaching emerges from non-speech, and transformation is accomplished through non-governance. Not violating what is fitting for things—this is how one assists and harmonizes with what is fitting for heaven and earth. Therefore, the Dao of heaven and earth is either yin or yang; the sage’s teaching is either benevolence or righteousness; and what is fitting for the myriad things is either softness or hardness. These all follow what is fitting and cannot exceed their positions.

The square and the round, the still and the active—principles cannot be combined. Yet when examining form and addressing affairs, names and divisions cannot encroach upon one another. In the coherence of principle, the square and the round need not conflict. Thus, the virtues of the Two Modes, the Dao of the sage, covering and nourishing the multitude of beings, and permeating the myriad things with their blessings—all attain their purity, tranquility, and true essence. Then, diverse paths merge, movement and stillness become one, for the sage does not violate the natures of the myriad things, and the myriad things do not transgress the sage’s transformation.

Whatever is fixated on one direction is obstructed by the divisions of form. The operation of the Dao is always profoundly penetrating and without dependence. Master Lu says: That which is moved by qi can cover and bear; that which is moved by spirit can teach and transform. Thus, heaven and earth give life to the myriad things, and the sage follows their forms and employs them.

The *Zhenghe* says: Heaven is positioned above, earth below, and the sage between heaven and earth—all to bring about transformation. As transformations alternate and arise, the myriad things have their differing fittingness. How could heaven and earth, along with the sage, violate what is fitting for them?

Thus, the sage’s relation to heaven and earth: when distinguished, they are the Three Extremes; when interconnected, they are the Three Powers. That which gives life and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot determine what is fitting. What is fittingly determined does not exceed its position. This speaks of the divisions of duty.

Therefore, in terms of their distinctions: the sage’s Dao reaches up to heaven and coils down to earth, transforming and nourishing the myriad things, yet it cannot be represented by images. Then, above and below flow together without separation—how could there be the mutual manifestation of strengths and shortcomings, or the mutual divergence of penetration and obstruction?

Master Fan says: Heaven has yin and yang, and earth has yin and yang. Thus, in the Dao of heaven and earth, yin and yang must value their interaction.

Without transformation, there is no life; without righteousness, there is no completion. Thus, in the sage’s teaching, benevolence and righteousness must value their mutual fulfillment. Movement and stillness have their constancy, and hardness and softness are thereby determined. Therefore, in the fittingness of the myriad things, hardness and softness must value their mutual blending.

Yet heaven and earth embody the Dao, and so they possess the power to cover and bear. The myriad things depend on them for life, yet they never retain the Dao. The sage embodies the Dao and assumes the duty of teaching and transformation, so things depend on him for completion, yet he never harbors intention. Both simply follow what is fitting for things and do not exceed their positions.

Why should the roc and the quail mock each other for their size? Why should Kui and the centipede pity each other for their many or few legs? One does not bathe the swan to blacken the crow, nor spin the duck’s down to sever the crane’s legs—each abides by its natural state and is left to spontaneity.

Thus, there are those that are born, and those that give birth; there are those that have form, and those that give form; there are those that have sound, and those that give sound; there are those that have color, and those that give color; there are those that have flavor, and those that give flavor. Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise in an instant yet cannot generate themselves. That which cannot generate itself is the root of non-action. The root of non-action is not bound to a single image, nor tied to a single flavor, and so it can serve as the master of form and qi, the source from which all movement proceeds.

Lu says: The beginning of form is called life; that which gives life to this life is called formative spirit. That which forms its form, sounds its sound, colors its color, and flavors its flavor—all are the work of spirit, using non-being to govern being. What is born of life dies, yet that which gives life never ends. What is formed of form is substantial, yet that which gives form never exists. What is sounded of sound is heard, yet that which gives sound never emits. What is colored of color is manifest, yet that which gives color never appears. What is flavored of flavor is tasted, yet that which gives flavor never presents itself.

All that is confined to a single form follows the cycle of generation and decay, and so what is born must end, while that which gives life to things knows no change. These are all the duties of non-action. The utterly non-existent is thus able to serve as the ancestral master of the myriad transformations.

Lu says: What spirit employs must have a beginning and an end. Form, sound, color, and flavor are not self-differentiating. Therefore, the hidden operation is the supreme work of spirit—non-action yet nothing left undone.

*Zhenghe* states: The arising of form, sound, color, and flavor are all transformations of things, so the hidden departs as the manifest arrives. Yet that which returns—what gives life, what gives form, what gives sound, what gives color, what gives flavor—are all the subtleties of the Dao. Who can trace their origin? Who can grasp their end? The Dao is constantly non-active yet leaves nothing undone—this is what is meant.

Fan says: The solitary does not generate; what does not generate can generate life. Thus, form, sound, color, and flavor all arise in dependence. Yet within the great void, when things attain the principle of life, their forms naturally appear. The great mountain and the autumn down—from where do they derive their form? Only the great image without form can give form to forms. The myriad winds blow differently, yet sounds naturally respond. Thunder’s roar and the midge’s flight—from where do they arise? Only the great sound without sound can give sound to sounds.

After movement ceases, color arises, yet it cannot color itself. Ornamentation without color is the color-giver of the active. After things are formed, flavor arises, yet it cannot flavor itself. Blandness without flavor is the flavor-giver of the active. It gives form yet has no form itself, so like a mirror’s stillness, beauty and ugliness are fully revealed, yet the mirror has no form—how could it share existence with what it reflects? It gives sound yet has no sound itself, so like an echoing valley, good and evil all respond, yet the valley has no sound—how could it share emission with what it echoes?

What is colored of color is manifest, so if one probes its root, traces its end, follows its hues, reverses its numbers, and seeks its limit, though colors differ, that which gives color never appears. What is flavored of flavor is tasted, so if one responds to saltiness, acts upon sourness, transforms through bitterness, exhausts sweetness, and changes through pungency, though flavors differ, that which gives flavor never presents itself. Then can the subtlety of life-giving be bound to perish with what is born of life? If not for that which is non-active yet leaves nothing undone, who could assume this duty? Thus it is said: These are all the duties of non-action.

It can be yin, it can be yang; it can be soft, it can be hard; it can be short, it can be long; it can be round, it can be square; it can give life, it can bring death; it can be hot, it can be cool; it can float, it can sink; it can be gong, it can be shang; it can emerge, it can submerge; it can be dark, it can be yellow; it can be sweet, it can be bitter; it can be rank, it can be fragrant. It has no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do. When knowledge is exhausted, there is no knowledge; when ability is perfected, there is no ability—thus there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do.

He Yan’s *Discourse on the Dao* says: Being as being relies on non-being to arise; affairs without affairs are accomplished through non-being. The Dao acts without speech, is named without a name, is seen without form, is heard without sound—this is the Dao in its entirety. Thus it can illuminate sounds and emit qi and things, envelop form and spirit and manifest light and shadow. Through it, the dark becomes black, the plain becomes white, the carpenter’s square becomes square, the compass becomes round. Round and square attain form, yet this has no form; white and black attain names, yet this has no name.

Lu says: The *Laozi* states: "I do not know whose child it is—it seems to have been before the Lord of Heaven." This is spirit, prior to heaven and earth, spirit of spirits and lord of lords—none can know it, none can verify it.

If one can embody and realize this Dao, then within heaven and earth there is nothing one does not know and nothing one cannot do.

Fan says: That which is hidden without form and profound beyond measure is called *yin*; that which exquisitely crafts heaven’s work and illuminates the myriad things is called *yang*. To be able to embrace both *yin* and *yang* is to transcend what *yin* and *yang* themselves can fathom.

To establish the root through bending and adapt to the times through flexibility—this is called *softness*. To embody solidity as one’s nature and employ decisiveness as one’s function—this is called *firmness*. To be able to be both soft and firm is to transcend what softness and firmness themselves can define.

Length and shortness take shape in relation to one another, as do the foot and inch—yet the Dao can be both short and long. Roundness and squareness are refined through one another, as are the compass and square—yet the Dao can be both round and square.

To be able to give life and bring death is to stand beyond fate’s reckoning. To be able to bring heat and coolness is to stand beyond time’s confinement.

When things are in water, the sinking cannot float, and the floating cannot sink—yet that which can both sink and float is like sunlight upon the water.

When things produce sound, striking *gong* moves *gong*, and striking *shang* resonates *shang*—yet that which can be both *gong* and *shang* is like the spontaneous music of heaven’s breath.

That which emerges from mechanism swiftly enters mechanism; that which emerges from darkness swiftly enters darkness. Only that which does not turn with mechanism or darkness can thus emerge and submerge.

In heaven, the profound is small, yet it is the subtlety of the Dao; on earth, yellow is central, yet it is the radiance of color. Only that which is not confined by heaven and earth can thus be both profound and yellow.

To be able to be sweet and bitter is to rest in the blandness of flavorlessness; to be able to be pungent and fragrant is to abide in the indifference of odorlessness. Such is the Dao’s non-action that is yet non-non-action—thus it is without knowledge.

Encompassing the myriad things without omission, it is without not-knowing and without not-able; carving all forms without being crafty, it is without not-able.

*Zhenghe* says: To have some knowledge and some ability is but a partial aspect of the Dao, not its full and complete realization. Yet to be without knowledge and yet without not-knowing, to be without ability and yet without not-able—this is to be all-encompassing, all-pervading. What then could one not do?

*Yin* and *yang* are *qi*; softness and firmness are materials; shortness and length are forms; roundness and squareness are implements; life and death are fate; heat and coolness are seasons; floating and sinking are conditions; *gong* and *shang* are sounds; emergence and submergence are traces; profoundness and yellow are colors; sweetness and bitterness are flavors; pungency and fragrance are scents. All transformations and creations arise from these. Is not such a person complete?

The six penetrations* and four openings*, the small and the great, the refined and the coarse—all their movements are present everywhere, whither could one go and not find them at leisure?

*The True Classic of Perfect Virtue in Four Explanations, Scroll One* ends here.
*The True Classic of Perfect Virtue in Four Explanations, Scroll Two: Heavenly Portents*

When Master Liezi journeyed to Wei, he took a meal by the roadside. His followers noticed a century-old skull, overgrown with brambles, and pointing to it, he turned to his disciple Baifeng, saying: "Only he and I know that we have never been born and never died. Both of us tread the path of transformation—thus I am born while he is dead. Yet if we push this to its ultimate realm, in principle there is neither birth nor death."

Lu* said: "In form there is birth and death, but in spirit there is neither death nor birth. I abide as spirit remains, while he departs as spirit departs. Though the skull and I differ in birth and death, if one awakens to the spirit, there has never been birth or death. Is this an excess of nurture? An excess of joy? When one encounters form, one cannot but nurture it; when one meets life, one cannot but rejoice. These are the errors of the deluded, not the true reality of principle."

Lu said: "Once one receives form, joy and nurture lose their proper measure, leading only to death."

*On the Seeds of Transformation:*
First, we inquire into the number of kinds of transformation—how many are there?—before clarifying them below.

The *yuan* becomes a quail; this is recorded in the *Mozi*. When it obtains water, it becomes a *geng*; at the border of water and earth, it becomes the clothing of frogs and toads. "Clothing" here means covering. Born in high and pure places—*lingtun* refers to lofty, clean ground—it becomes *lingxi*. This is transformation according to the place of birth.

The *lingxi* obtains *yuqi* and becomes *wuzu*. This is mutual generation through combination. The root of *wuzu* becomes a grub, and its leaves become butterflies. "Root" refers to the origin, "leaves" to the scattered parts—thus *wuzu* is the origin of the grub, and its dispersed parts transform into butterflies.

Butterflies, in turn, all transform—*xu* means "all," indicating that all things undergo change—and become insects, born beneath the stove. Their form resembles a cast-off skin, and their name is *yiduo*. This is transformation within a single form.

After a thousand days, *yiduo* dies and transforms into a bird called *qianyugu*. The foam of *qianyugu* becomes *simi*. "Foam" here refers to the essence that arises. *Simi* becomes *shixi yilu*, *shixi yilu* is born from *shixi huangxu*, *shixi huangxu* from *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* from *maorui*, and *maorui* from *fuxuan*. These are all cases of a single form dying and being reborn.

Sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*, horse’s blood into *zhuanlin*, and human blood into *wildfire*. These are all spontaneous transformations within a single form.

The sparrowhawk becomes a *zhan*, the *zhan* becomes a cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to a sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes a clam, the field mouse becomes a quail, the rotten melon becomes a fish, old leeks become amaranth, the aged ram becomes a *yuan* (a ram is a male sheep), and fish roe becomes insects. These are all natural transformations without external cause.

The beast of *Danyuan* conceives by itself and is called *lei*. *Dan* is pronounced *shi*. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "On Mount Danyuan there is a beast resembling a wildcat with fur, named *lei*, which reproduces as both male and female."

The birds of rivers and marshes conceive by gazing and are called *yi*. This is birth through mutual gaze. *Zhuangzi* says: "White *yi* birds gaze at one another, their pupils unmoving, and the wind transforms them."

The purely female is called *dayao*, and the purely male is called *zhifeng*. *Dayao* refers to creatures like turtles and soft-shelled turtles. *Zhi* means "small." These transform without male or female.

Having discussed the principles of insects and beasts, we now clarify that the Way of humans is likewise.

A longing scholar remains unwed yet becomes moved; a longing maiden remains husbandless yet conceives. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: "There is a country of Thoughtful Seclusion, where longing scholars take no wives, and longing maidens take no husbands." Through the subtle resonance of essence and qi, they bear children without intercourse. This is akin to the white *yi* birds.

Hou Ji was born from a giant footprint. Records say: "Jiang Yuan, consort of Emperor Gaoxin, saw a giant footprint and, admiring it, trod upon it. As if moved by some principle, she conceived and gave birth to Hou Ji. Grown wise, he became an aide to Yao and was the ancestor of the Zhou."

Yi Yin was born from an empty mulberry tree. Records say: "Yi Yin’s mother lived by the Yi River. After conceiving, she dreamed a spirit told her: 'When mortar water flows out, flee eastward and do not look back.' The next day, she saw mortar water flowing out and told her neighbors. Fleeing ten *li* east, she looked back to see her village submerged. Her body transformed into an empty mulberry tree. A girl of the Youxin clan, gathering mulberries, found an infant within the hollow tree and named him Yi Yin, presenting him to her lord. Ordered to be raised by a cook, he grew wise and became Prime Minister to Tang of Yin."

Jue Zhao was born from moisture—this is birth through steam and dampness. Vinegar flies are born from wine—this is birth through sour qi. The sheep’s millet compares to the *bugun*—this is affinity between different kinds.

Old bamboo gives birth to *qingning*, born in forests and marshes. *Qingning* gives birth to *cheng*. From *geng* to *cheng*, all are living things—snakes, birds, insects, and beasts—showing their ceaseless transformations: some change through form, some die and are reborn, beginning and end following one another endlessly.

*Cheng* gives birth to horses, horses to humans, and humans in time enter the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism. How can the transformations of life and death be fathomed?

Born here, one may die there; dying there, one may be born here. Yet the master of form’s arising has never for a moment been absent. Thus the sage knows that life is not eternally preserved, death is not forever extinguished, and the transformations of a single qi take on ten thousand forms.

The ten thousand forms undergo ten thousand transformations, yet that which does not transform abides in the unchanging—this is called the *mechanism*. The mechanism is the origin of all beings, the source to which all movement traces back. Thus, from non-being it issues forth into being, from being it scatters back into non-being—nothing does not proceed from it.

Lu asks: Are there kinds among seeds? Or do they mutually give rise to one another? This question is posed to clarify that where the spirit goes, there is life; where the spirit departs, there is death. Form has no constant master, spirit no constant shape. The spirit has no fixed term, while form congeals—once it receives the substance of being, it is bound as if by the mechanism’s constraints. To live is to emerge; to die is to return.

In the *Zhenghe* edition of the *Book of Changes*, it is said: "Trace beginnings back to their end, and thus know the discourse on death and life." For where there is life, there must be death, yet those who die here may not fail to be born there. One who grasps this knows only the present and the other—never having been born, never having died. Now living, now dying; now dying, now living—thus one nurtures form and delights in life. What exists now is but what once passed away. Hence it is said: Is this nurturing a passing? Is this delight a passing? As the ten thousand things succeed one another in different forms, the transformations of life and death are beyond reckoning. Thus it is asked: How many kinds are there? What follows is but what the eyes and ears can perceive.

That frogs become quails speaks to the transformations of the ten thousand things between rivers and lands. *Xun*, the cast-off skin of frogs and toads, and *lingxi* are of one kind. Some, finding water or the border of water and earth, are born below; others, finding high ground, are born above—this shows how the ten thousand things transform according to the forms and qi they encounter. *Lingxi* that obtains dense shade becomes *wuzu*; thus it borrows another thing as its body. The root of *wuzu* becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies—thus the same body scatters into different things. Butterflies, called *xu*, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off shell, their name *yiduo*. Here, winged creatures transform into wriggling ones. After a thousand days, *yiduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*—here, burrowing creatures transform into forest-dwellers. Some shift through form, as when *simi* becomes *yilu*. Others arise from origins like the yellow *huangkuang* born from rotten *guanxuan*, or the transformations of *tianlu*, *zhuanzhen*, and wildfire. Some reverse through nature, as when the sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk the cuckoo, and the cuckoo reverts to the sparrow hawk. Swallows become clams, field mice become quails, rotting claws become fish, old leeks become amaranth, aged rams become apes, and fish eggs become insects—some follow their kind, others form kinds from what is unlike. The beast *danyuan* conceives itself and gives birth to its kind without external stimulus. The river marsh bird *yi* is born from gazing—without mating. The purely female is called *dayao*, the purely male *zhifeng*—thus among things, there are those that generate themselves through a single yin or yang. The longing scholar remains unwed yet stirs, the yearning maiden remains husbandless yet conceives—thus among humans, there are those who connect subtly beyond yin and yang. Even the birth of Hou Ji from a giant footprint, or Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry, though beyond inquiry, are not to be marveled at. *Juezhao* is born from dampness—transformed by qi; *xiji* is born from wine—transformed by flavor; *yangxi* pairs with *bugou*—transformed by habit; old bamboo gives rise to *qingning*—from the insentient arises the sentient; *qingning* gives birth to *cheng*—from the unknowing arises the knowing. The *Shizi* takes *cheng* as a kind of leopard; *cheng* gives birth to horses—thus like gives rise to like; horses give birth to humans—thus unlike gives rise to unlike. Yet the comings and goings of insects, the life and death of plants and trees, are transformations without end—how can one know the order of life and death? Only this: the ten thousand things have their origins in sprouting, their return in dissolution. The sage, knowing this, understands they are bound by the mechanism’s constraints and cannot cease.

Fan says: The Dao has no beginning or end, but things have life and death, smelted in the great transformation’s crucible. When qi gathers and forms arise, we forcibly call it life; when the mechanism of creation turns and something is left behind, qi scatters and form decays—we forcibly call it death. The gathering and scattering of qi are but the coming and going of floating clouds; the presence and absence of form are but the rising and vanishing of a bubble. The names of life and death stand in opposition: now dead, now alive, as a dream ends and waking comes; now alive, now dead, as waking ends and dreaming comes. Who knows the reason for this? Only those who trace beginnings back to their end know that one has never died, never been born—coming without source, going without destination, nearly entering the realm of neither death nor life. A skull a hundred years old is but the remnant of decayed bone—what does it know? Yet *Zhuangzi* records its words: "How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?" Thus it is clear: it did not delight in life and loathed death. The benighted of the world cling to a single body and wish, fixated on the ten thousand transformations. Born, they transform into death and grieve; thus is this nurturing a passing? For they fear death. Dead, they transform into life and rejoice; thus is this delight a passing? For they delight in life. Yet what is there truly to fear in death, or to delight in in life? These are but the ten thousand transformations, endless and unbounded. Moreover, as the ten thousand things succeed one another, their names differ—quails, *xun*, the cast-off skin of frogs and toads, *lingxi*—these are one kind, yet some find water, some the border of water and earth, some high ground, and their births differ accordingly.

The mole cricket, the grub, the butterfly—they and the *lingxi* are also of one kind, yet some dwell in dense thickets, some on leaves, some on roots, and their transformations differ accordingly. The *ciruo*, the dried bones, the *simi*, the vinegar gnat—they and the *xu* are also of one kind, yet some thrive beneath the stove, some after a thousand days, some in their own foam, and their births differ accordingly.

The vinegar gnat is born of vinegar; the yellow *huang* feeds on vinegar, the yellow *huang* is born of the *jiuyou*, the *jiuyou* of the *maorui*, the *maorui* of the rotten *quan*—thus their kind is unknown, arising naturally. The sheep’s liver transforms into the *digao*, the horse’s blood into the *zhuanlin*, human blood into wildfire, the sparrow hawk into the *zhan*, the *zhan* into the cuckoo; the swallow into the clam, the field mouse into the quail, rotting claws into fish, old leeks into amaranth, aged rams into apes, fish eggs into insects—thus their kind is unknown, transforming naturally.

There are those conceived of themselves, like the beast *danyuan*; those born by gazing at one another, like the birds of rivers and marshes; the *dayao* kind, purely female without males; the *zhifeng* kind, purely male without females. By the longing of the scholar, one may conceive without a wife; by the longing of the maiden, one may conceive without a husband. As for the *juezhao* and the vinegar fly, they arise from some cause, while the *yangxi* without haste has no cause to compare. The *jiuzhu*, the *qingning*, the *cheng*—these too are born of horses and humans.

Observing thus, some things are born of emotion, some without emotion; some emotion gives rise to the emotionless, some the emotionless to the emotional. Some are born without cause, some without stimulus—ten thousand forms, ten thousand transformations, without end or limit. Could it be that there is a mechanism, an inevitability? When function emerges, it bursts forth vigorously—all that emerges does so from this mechanism. When function retreats, it flows smoothly away—all that retreats does so into this mechanism. Though myriad in difference, born and dying, none know their origin. Yet in the tension of the spiritual mechanism, the movement of the qi mechanism, there is assuredly one that governs, revolves, and controls.

Liezi first discussed the office of non-action, then followed with this—rightly so. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: "When form moves, it does not generate form but shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but echo." Where there is form, there must be shadow; where there is sound, there must be echo. These arise naturally, emerge together, and vanish together—how could there be a sequence of dependence or precedence?

Guo Xiang’s commentary on the *Zhuangzi* elaborates this in detail. Yet世’s speakers claim that when form moves, shadow follows, and when sound issues, echo responds. The sage takes this as a metaphor, clarifying that when things move, they lose their root; when still, they return to it—no longer entangled in the intricate interplay of influence and response. Without movement, the insubstantial does not generate the substantial. The existence of the substantial relies on the insubstantial to arise; to speak of arising is necessarily from the insubstantial, yet the insubstantial does not fail to generate the substantial. This function of circulation and penetration necessarily depends on the insubstantial. Thus the term "arising and moving" is established in accordance with circumstances.

Lu says: "What has form can generate, but cannot generate the formless—shadow and echo are examples. The spirit, though formless, when moved, generates the substantial—all things are examples." Fan says: "The shadow as shadow seems to depend on form, yet in truth depends on nothing. When form moves, shadow naturally follows—shadow does not seek form. The echo as echo seems to depend on sound, yet in truth depends on nothing. When sound moves, echo naturally responds—echo does not seek sound. The principle of being born from the insubstantial is like this."

Form must end. Do heaven and earth end? They end together with me. Measuring great and small, calculating long and short, they differ from me; yet in converging upon an end, the principle is no different. Lu says: "Though great and small differ, they alike come to an end." Fan says: "The end of things is like the end of the year; the end of numbers is like winter. Without things, without time—who knows where they end? Heaven and earth are the greatest of forms; once confined to form, though they may wish not to end, can they avoid it?"

Do they advance toward an end? One cannot know. "Advance" should be "cease." In this text, "cease" is often written as "advance." When things gather, they form; when they scatter, they end—this is the world’s so-called end and beginning. Yet for the gathered, the beginning is solid form, the end is dispersion; for the scattered, the beginning is emptiness, the end is solid form. Thus they alternately serve as each other’s end and beginning, yet in principle there is truly no end and no beginning.

Lu says: "‘Advance’ should be ‘cease’—suppose one asks whether heaven and earth have an end. Or does one not know? The answer follows. The Way ends at what has no beginning, ceases at what is not long-lasting. ‘Long-lasting’ should be ‘existent.’ Without beginning, it does not end; without existence, it does not cease." Fan says: "Without things, without time—who can speak of end and beginning? Without days, without years—who can speak of long and short? To say the Way ends—how could that be? It is simply unknown."

The "no beginning" it speaks of is what *Zhuangzi* calls "never yet having had a beginning." Can the Way truly be said to cease? It simply remains unknown. The "not long-lasting" it speaks of is what *Zhuangzi* calls "existing before heaven and earth yet not being long-lasting." Where there is birth, there is a return to non-birth; where there is form, there is a return to formlessness. The born revert to their end, the formed revert to emptiness—such is the natural principle.

Lu says: "All things with a beginning and an end originate from what has no beginning and return to what does not exist. If we speak from the perspective of *Tai Chu* (Great Beginning) and *Hun Dun* (Primal Chaos), this implies a beginning—how then could there be no end? How could there be no cessation? The 'non-born'—this non-born first had birth before reverting to death and extinction. It is not originally non-born; the originally non-born has never had birth or extinction from the outset. The 'formless'—this formless first had form before reverting to dispersion. It is not originally formless; the originally formless has never had aggregation or dispersion from the outset. That which gives birth to life does not itself undergo birth; that which gives form to things has no form. Thus it can give form to the myriad things while its own essence remains unchanged. To say that what is born and formed later returns to non-birth and formlessness is merely the cyclical alternation of existence and extinction—it is not the unchanging nature of beginning and end."

Lu says: "The 'non-birth' of spirit does not mean it was never born. The birth of the myriad things and the formation of all beings are all set in motion by spirit. Because it can give birth, once born, it embodies itself without birth or extinction—it is not that there is no form or birth, but that it is identical to the *qi* of the Great Void."

Fan says: "What is born by birth dies and returns to non-birth. What is formed by form becomes solid and returns to formlessness. The 'non-born' is not originally non-born but arises from having been born and then reverts to this state. How can this be what gives birth without itself being born? The 'formless' is not originally formless but arises from having had form and then reverts to this state. How can this be what gives form without itself having form? Birth is a principle that must end. Ending cannot but end, just as birth cannot but begin. The born does not give birth to itself yet is self-born—though born, it does not know how it is born. Not knowing how it is born, birth cannot be severed; not knowing how it dies, death cannot be resisted. To desire to preserve one’s life and exhaust one’s end is to be deluded by principle."

"Exhaustion" means annihilation.

Lu says: "Things that are born must have an end, just as the harmonious *qi* that sprouts plants and trees cannot but give birth. To wish for eternal life is to be deluded by the supreme principle."

Fan says: "Birth has its origin in sprouting, death has its return in dissolution. Beginning and end revolve without end, and none know where they cease—there is surely a principle governing this. To desire to fear their exhaustion is merely to cling without loss to the cycle of birth and death, unaware and unenlightened. Is this not delusion?

Spirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh belong to earth’s portion. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and aggregates. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—heaven’s portion returns to heaven, earth’s portion returns to earth, each reverting to its origin. Thus it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means "return"—returning to its true dwelling. The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void."

Lu says: "When spirit and brightness depart from form, it is called death. Returning to the true dwelling is reverting to the Great Clarity. To take the Great Clarity as the true dwelling is to clarify that this form and bones are but empty illusion."

Fan says: "Essence is water; spirit is fire. Water and fire combine to generate earth. Thus when a person is born, essence gathers and spirit assembles, and the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all thereby established. Spirit belongs to heaven’s portion because it moves without end and is thus clear and disperses. Bones and flesh belong to earth’s portion because they are constant and unchanging and are thus turbid and aggregate. When spirit disperses, each returns to its true nature—this is why it is called *gui*. To elaborate further: when a person is first born, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and *qi* are all complete before form is established. *Hun* is like clouds—it follows spirit without ceasing. *Po* is like whiteness—it governs things and has its limits. The sage uses *hun* to restrain *po*, so spirit does not become enslaved to form. The common person follows *po* with *hun*, so spirit is insufficient to command form. When spirit does not become enslaved to form, even in death there is no difference from life. When spirit is insufficient to command form, even in life there is no difference from death. The death of a worthy person becomes a ghost—though one may say their ghost lacks spirit, it is still distinct from those who sink into dark yin and transform into other beings. *Liezi*’s words, though not reaching the ultimate, provisionally speak of returning to the true dwelling, and thus call it *gui*."

The *Erya* says: "*Gui* means 'return.'" The Yellow Emperor said: "Spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what of me remains? What birth lacks form? What form lacks *qi*? What *qi* lacks numinosity? Thus the mind, wisdom, form, and bones are one body in the yin realm, a partial accumulation of one *qi*. When they depart from form and return to the root, they revert to their true dwelling, and I have no thing."

Lu says: "Ordinary people take form as the self, and through the self, emotions arise. Those with many emotions are deeply mired in love; those with few emotions have meager desires. Only the perfected person has no self and fully comprehends spirit. Ordinary people, not understanding, cling ever more tightly—when spirit returns to the true and form returns to earth, where then is the former self?"

*Zhenghe* says: "Stillness returns to nature; movement departs from the root—such is principle."

Form moves yet does not generate form—it generates shadow. Sound moves yet does not generate sound—it generates echo. Non-movement does not generate non-being—it generates being, and thus one strays far from the root. Non-being generates being; being must return to non-being. Hence it is said: form must end. Heaven and earth are born together with me; when they end, they end together with me. Who knows their limit? Thus to speak of an end is to advance into the unknown.

That which has an end has a beginning; that which endures has a fleeting moment—these pertain only to temporal things. Therefore, to have a beginning is to take the beginningless as the supreme Dao; to end at the root is to reach the ultimate. The beginningless is again the ultimate. That which endures takes the non-enduring as the supreme Dao, advancing toward the root; the non-enduring is again the ultimate.

Why is it that when there is life, it returns to non-life, and when there is form, it returns to formlessness? The non-living is not suddenly non-living; the formless is not originally formless—it is only from the perspective of those with life and form that this appears so. Life is principle’s inevitable end; what ends cannot but end, and what lives cannot but live. Yet to desire life’s eternal persistence, to take the end as a boundary—how can one then comprehend the boundlessness within the cycle? This is the delusion of those who fixate on numbers.

Life is heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony. Spirit is heaven’s portion—thus it is clear and disperses. Bones are earth’s portion—thus they are turbid and congeal. When spirit scatters and returns to its true nature, what remains of me? Yet this is spoken from the perspective of ordinary people.

Thus it is said: spirit enters its gate; bones return to their root—what then remains of me? But the sage, above, roams with the Creator; below, returns with those without end or beginning. Thus his form never decays, and I alone endure.

Fan says: The myriad things have their emergence, yet none see their gate; they have their birth, yet none see their root. Spirit entering its gate returns to whence it came; bones returning to their root revert to whence they were born. If this is so, then returning to the true dwelling, what remains of me? The sage gathers essence to concentrate spirit, employs spirit to govern form, and sustains spirit through form. Essence remains whole and undiminished; spirit is used yet inexhaustible; form lives yet does not decay. Closing the gate, no thing enters through the eyes; deepening the root, no thing can shake it. The unperishing appearance has existed since ancient times—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision. The ancients cultivated themselves for twelve hundred years, yet their forms never decayed, for they had advanced beyond this.

From birth to end, the great transformation has four phases. Between them, change occurs without a moment’s pause—these four are but a rough outline. Lu says: The infant has not yet given rise to right and wrong in the heart, thus virtue is profound and the will is single-minded. When desires and thoughts arise in abundance, those who attack them must be many. In old age, *qi* softens, drawing nearer to the Dao, and at life’s ultimate end, one rests. Infancy, youth, old age, death.

Fan says: Observing from the perspective of non-being, the true and constant abides in profound stillness, enduring since ancient times. Thus rivers rush ceaselessly, yet in truth they never flow. Observing from the perspective of being, the great transformation shifts imperceptibly—crossing arms, one has already lost it. Though Mount Song stands firm, it cannot avoid concealment. Once one enters the mechanism of yin and yang, traverses the path of creation and transformation, then what takes form is indeed real. No movement is without change; no moment is without shift. Borrowing light from a mirror, the present "I" is not the former "I"; halting a lamp before a jar, the flame is not the later flame. Grasping the tools of time, dwelling in the boundless, appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor remain unchanged for a day—yet can one truly escape transformation? Thus from infancy to youth, from old age to death, the great transformation advances daily, with no interval to spare.

Only one who is seamless day and night can penetrate day and night, and knowing that ancient and modern do not replace one another, can participate in the ten thousand years. Reversing and returning through ends and beginnings, lifting heaven and earth to hasten toward stillness—this is transformation transforming yet not transformed by transformation.

In infancy, *qi* is single-minded and the will is unified—harmony at its utmost. No thing harms it; no virtue surpasses it. *Laozi* says: "One whose virtue is profound resembles an infant." Fan says: The child dwells without knowing what it does, moves without knowing where it goes. Thus its *qi* is single and unadulterated; its will is unified and unwavering. Inwardly, harmony is firmly established—nothing can harm it; sorrow and misfortune cannot enter; perverse *qi* cannot assail it. Thus its virtue is complete and its form unharmed. This is what *Laozi* calls "one whose virtue is profound."

In youth, blood and *qi* overflow; desires and thoughts arise in abundance. Things assail it; virtue thus declines. Standing in the arena of striving, things do not align with it. Fan says: This is what Confucius called "when blood and *qi* are just at their peak." In old age, desires and thoughts soften; the body prepares to rest, and no thing precedes it. Rest. Having no competitive heart, no thing contends with it. Though not yet equal to the infant’s wholeness, it surpasses youth. Fan says: This is what *Zhuangzi* called "letting me grow old in ease."

In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate. Lu says: Drawing near to nature, one embodies the Dao; deluded by emotions, one loses the true. Thus one whose virtue is profound resembles an infant; weary yet not acting is still secondary. Compared to those who race and compete, the difference is vast. *Zhenghe* says: In infancy, *qi* is single-minded and the will is unified—harmony at its utmost. This is what *Laozi* called "one whose virtue is profound." In youth, blood and *qi* overflow; desires and thoughts arise in abundance. This is what *Zhuangzi* called "engaging with things in contention."

As one ages, blood and *qi* wane, desires and thoughts soften, and the body prepares for rest. When one returns to the true dwelling, one comes to rest, reverting to the ultimate. This is what *Zhuangzi* meant by: "The great clod bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death."

From infancy to death, all passes away day by day—thus it is called transformation. Fan says: This is what Zigong meant by "the noble person comes to rest." The four transformations of form are common to all life. The multitude undergo physical transformation, and their hearts transform with it; the sage undergoes external transformation, yet within remains unchanged.

Confucius, traveling on Mount Tai, saw Rong Qigi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe with a rope belt, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked him: "Sir, what is the source of your joy?" He replied: "My joys are many. Heaven gives birth to the ten thousand things, and man is the most noble—yet I have been born a man: that is my first joy. Extending this reasoning, the spirit and *qi* of man differ not from those of other beings; only their paths diverge, hence their forms vary. Thus Rong Qigi deeply probed the causes of fortune and misfortune, clearly discerned the signs of the hidden and manifest, and so rejoiced in attaining human form and, moreover, the dignity of manhood—his words were no idle boast. Between man and woman, man is honored and woman is humble; thus to be born a man is esteemed. Having been born a man, that is my second joy. Before a person is born, whether man or woman is not yet fixed—thus I rejoice again in having attained a male body. Among men, some never see the sun and moon, never leave their swaddling clothes; yet I have lived to ninety years: that is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar; death is the end of all men. To dwell in constancy and meet one’s end—what cause for sorrow?" Confucius said: "Excellent! He is one who can console himself." Not entirely forgetting joy and sorrow, he was nonetheless adept at reasoning to console himself.

Lu says: When the great smelter casts metal, it follows the mold to take shape. Thus spirit serves as the mold, and the myriad forms are completed through it. Whether man or woman, long-lived or short-lived, yin and yang are already determined—why? Spirit directs its work, and form repays the labor. Since form cannot perfect itself, and spirit, though formless, already knew Qigi’s fate, his joy only began in old age. This is to awaken to the Dao late, his emotions still bound to form. The Master merely praised his self-consolation, not granting him deep attainment of the ultimate Way.

Lin Lei was nearly a hundred years old, yet no records of him survive—likely a recluse of old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe (for it was still cold), gleaned stray grains from the harvested fields, and sang as he walked. Confucius, traveling to Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples: "That old man may be worth speaking to. Go and inquire of him." Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of a ridge. Facing him, he sighed and said: "Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you go?" Lin Lei did not pause in his steps or cease his song. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, until at last he looked up and replied: "What should I regret?" Zigong said: "In youth, you did not strive in conduct; in maturity, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy do you find in gleaning and singing?" Lin Lei laughed and said: "The source of my joy is something all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. What I find joy in, all men share, but they cannot remain level in the face of events, so they know no moment’s gladness."

Lu says: The humane are not anxious, the wise are not fearful—they do not cling to form, for life’s lot follows them. Thus the noble person is not distressed by poverty and low station, nor restless for wealth and honor. Those who fail to grasp this turn it into sorrow—why do you find me strange? In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in maturity, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. Not striving in conduct, I left behind fame and reputation; not competing with the times, I had no profit or desire. With these two absent from my heart, I have attained a lifespan of a hundred years without seeking it.

Lu says: To pursue conduct beyond one’s lot, to compete for opportunities beyond fate—such striving harms life and shortens years. My joy comes from knowing Heaven’s decree and attaining this longevity. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be joyful like this. This is what it means to delight in Heaven and know fate, and so be without sorrow.

Lu says: Wife and children only weary life and trouble the heart—how can they extend a man’s years? Dwelling in constancy and awaiting one’s end, the heart knows no sorrow or distress—thus one can be joyful like this.

Zigong said: "Longevity is what men desire; death is what they detest. Why do you find joy in death?" Lin Lei said: "Death and life are but a going and a returning. Thus one who dies here—how do we know they are not born there? So I know they are not the same. How do I know that busily striving for life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?" Pursuing this meaning, existence and extinction, going and returning, are endless.

Lu says: Knowing that form undergoes change while spirit knows no death or life, that going and coming are like morning and evening—why then cling greedily to this and fear that?

Zigong, not comprehending his meaning, returned and told the Master. The Master said: "I knew he was worth speaking to—indeed, so it is. Yet what he has attained is not yet complete." Hearing Lin Lei’s words, Zigong had thought he had reached the ultimate, but the Master said he had not yet fully grasped it. To be complete is to be complete in all things, yet also to be complete in nothing—only then is principle wholly fulfilled. Now, when one opposes non-being to being, rejects that and takes this, one cannot but perceive a difference between inner and outer. Yet what remains incomplete is but a small part.

Should the myriad transformations return to the mysterious One, where self and other are both forgotten, principle naturally levels itself—yet in truth, nothing is cast aside. When inner darkness and outer wandering merge with the common crowd, how can there be any question of completeness or incompleteness?

Lu says: To die here and live there is the inevitable principle. What Lin Lei spoke of was but words of doubt and semblance—hence it is called incomplete.

In the *Zhenghe* edition, the *Book of Changes* states: "Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus free from care." Abiding in constancy to the end, death and life bring no change to oneself—this is the source of one’s joy. Cultivating the self, accepting poverty or success, knowing that going and coming are not real, and that I am not disturbed by change in the heart’s deliberations—what sorrow can there be? Yet to know joy and to know sorrow is not true joy. Confucius took the absence of joy as true joy. Rong Qiqi was truly able to ease himself, while Lin Lei had grasped it but not fully.

Fan says: The living are companions of death, and the dead are the beginning of life. In the ten thousand transformations, there is no end—only those who trace origins and return to endings truly understand the discourse on death and life. From the perspective of not delighting in life nor detesting death, those who greedily seek life may be called deluded. Yet how can one know it is delusion? From the toil of life and the rest of death, the dead today are surely better than the living of the past. Yet how can one know they are better than the living of the past?

Observing Lin Lei’s words, one sees he is truly worth speaking to. Yet when viewed by what he took as joy, he still could not avoid opposing non-being to being, taking this and rejecting that—thus the Master said he had grasped it but not fully.

Zigong, weary of learning, said to Confucius: "I wish to rest." The purpose of learning is to return to one’s original state, yet to grow weary of it is to damage the principle of nature. Confucius said: "In life, there is no rest." To toil the mind and employ the limbs—these are the affairs of the living. As *Zhuangzi* truly says: "Life is corvée labor."

Zigong said: "Then is there no place for me, Ci, to rest?" Confucius said: "There is. Look to the grave mounds—soaring, towering, swelling, and rising—then you will know where rest lies." Seeing the distinctness of their burial mounds, one knows rest has its place. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Death is rest."

Zigong said: "Great is death! The noble man rests in it; the petty man is laid low in it." Rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate, awaiting the end with composure—this is the noble man’s rest. Departing from sorrow and suffering, dying in oblivion—this is the petty man’s submission.

Confucius said: "Ci, you have understood. People all know the joy of life but not its suffering; they know the weariness of old age but not its ease; they know the dread of death but not its rest." As *Zhuangzi* says: "The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death."

Lu says: Life is the substance of activity and function—only in death can one truly rest. It is like the sun’s streaming light, where all things move; the noble man pursues fame, the petty man pursues profit—never resting.

"Zhenghe says: If one studies the Dao yet does not reach the understanding of death, what is the use of such study? Zigong grew weary of learning and wished to rest—this shows he did not comprehend the meaning of death. Thus the Master told him that in life there is no rest, gazing toward the grave: its brightness is like the sun’s radiance, its height like the ruler’s majesty, its mound vast as the earth, its vessel sealed—utterly cut off from the world. This is where rest lies. Yet while the common people call death a thing, the noble man, though dead, does not perish. Hence it is said: the noble man rests in it; the petty man is laid low in it.

The suffering of life is what is meant by 'labors me with life'; the ease of old age is what is meant by 'eases me with old age'; the rest of death is what is meant by 'rests me with death.' Fan says: *Laozi* states, 'In the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.' And again: 'Cut off learning, and there is no sorrow.' Zigong, weary of study and wishing to rest, had not yet advanced in daily accumulation—how then could he reduce and reduce again, achieve non-action yet accomplish all things, and attain that which is called 'cutting off learning'? Confucius told him that in life there is no rest, urging him to strive unceasingly until death.

*Zhuangzi* says: 'The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death.' Does the one who embodies the Dao have no part in the ease of old age or the rest of death? Is this spoken only for those burdened with form and labored by life? Thus Confucius answered Zigong in this way.

Yanzi said: 'Excellent! The ancients had death.' Life and death are the same in past and present, yet only the death of the ancients is praised—this makes clear that the ancients did not delight in life nor detest death. The virtuous man rests in death; the unvirtuous man is laid low. Cultivating the self and acting with caution, ever mindful and fearful—this is the concern of the virtuous. Indulging in desires without restraint, never satisfied—this is the suffering of the unvirtuous. Only in death do they find rest and submission.

Death is the culmination of virtue. 'Virtue' means 'attainment'; 'culmination' means 'return.' It speaks of each attaining its proper return. The ancients called the dead 'those who return.' If the dead are called 'those who return,' then the living are 'those who journey.' To journey without knowing return is to lose one’s home. If one person loses their home, the world condemns them; if the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it. This is how the many and the few overthrow one another. Yanzi, a Confucian and Mohist in his teachings, valued form and life—yet he did not distinguish this in his words, merely borrowing what he cited.

Lu says: *Laozi* states, 'Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering one’s mandate; recovering one’s mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination.' Not knowing constancy, acting recklessly—this brings misfortune. The embodied spirit receives but a single term of retribution, deluded by its origin and clinging to existence, exhausting spirit and mind—weariness reaches its limit. Only in death does one return to the true, like casting off shackles and laying down a burden. Those who cling to life and fear death, attached to existence, do not know to return to the root—yet the world does not condemn them. The deluded are many.

There are those who leave their homeland, part from the six relations, abandon their family and livelihood, wander the four directions without returning—what manner of people are these? The world must call them reckless and dissolute. And there are those who cling to worldly worth, cling to worldly worth—one would expect them to value form and life, boast of their skills, cultivate reputation, and vaunt themselves in the world, yet they know not themselves—what manner of people are these? The world must call them wise and cunning. These two are both lost. Though their conduct differs in small ways, neither escapes drowning and ruin. Yet the world approves of one and not the other—only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject. Those who regard life and death as waking and dreaming are to be embraced; those who drown and forget their return are to be abandoned.

Lu says: To abandon the root and chase the branches, to exhaust spirit and mind—whether following emotions or seeking fame, whether pursuing desires or chasing profit—both are lost. What is weighty, what is slight? Yet the multitude calls one right, and the whole world follows; whatever they cling to, the whole world calls wrong."

Only those who embody the Dao know what to embrace and what to abandon. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: Zang and Gu, two shepherds, both lost their sheep. One was absorbed in gambling, the other in reading—though their conduct differed in good and ill, the loss of their sheep was the same. If one strays from the Dao, then wandering the world or pursuing study—how far apart are they?

*Zhenghe* says: Life and death are likewise submissive. To perfect one’s life is to perfect one’s death, hence the saying: "Excellent indeed!" The ancients had death, yet death without annihilation is called longevity. The humane attain longevity, while the inhumane perish with things—thus it is said: "The humane rest, the inhumane submit." There is a place of return.

Life is yang. Life is the radiance of virtue, and radiance arises from yang. Death is yin. Death is the return of virtue, and return arises from yin. Thus to take life as journey and death as homecoming is the meaning of yin and yang, movement and stillness. The reckless lose themselves, and the cunning lose themselves. Outwardly they reject this to grasp that—such is the blindness of the world. Only the sage knows what to embrace and what to abandon.

Fan says: When a person dies, it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means "return"—to return to one’s true dwelling. Once grasping the finite span of life, entrusting oneself to an inescapable place, clashing and grinding against things, one’s conduct is like a galloping horse that cannot be reined in—is this not lamentable? To toil one’s whole life without seeing accomplishment, wearily laboring without knowing where to return—how can this not be pitiful? Such are those who wander astray without turning back; people call them "undying," but what benefit is there?

Consider one who leaves homeland, severs the six relations, abandons family and livelihood, and roams the four directions without returning—what manner of person is this? Merely a wanderer of creation, a traveler in the inn of yin and yang, wearily laboring without knowing return. Then there is one who clings to worldly worth, prides himself on conduct and ability, cultivates reputation, and strives to display himself in the world without self-knowledge—what manner of person is this? Merely one who adorns cleverness to startle the foolish, cultivates the self to expose others’ flaws, and peddles fame alone in the world. Though these two differ, in drowning and forgetting their return they are one. Yet the world approves of one and not the other—some deem themselves reckless, others deem themselves cunning. In essence, only the sage knows what to embrace and what to abandon.

*Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing Sijie*, Scroll Three.

Someone once asked Master Liezi, "Why do you value emptiness?"
Liezi replied, "Emptiness is beyond valuation. All valuations arise from preferring this over that, affirming oneself while negating others. But when both sides are forgotten and the myriad differences merge into oneness, this is called emptiness. If emptiness is truly empty, where can the names of noble and base arise?"

Fan said: "The valley responds because it is empty; the mirror reflects because it is empty; the flute and pipe receive sound because they are empty; the ear hears because it is empty; the eye sees because it is empty; the nose smells because it is empty. If there is solidity or fullness within, it obstructs these functions—emptiness is indeed worthy of esteem. Yet what is esteemed here is despised there, and the names of noble and base remain untranscended. If one is transformed by the Dao, why value emptiness?"

Master Liezi said: "It is not about the name. Things have their evident reality, not merely derived from names. Nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness. Stillness and emptiness attain their proper place; grasping and giving lose their proper place. The principle of emptiness and stillness lies not beyond the mind’s deliberations or outside the bodily form. Seek and attain it, and it is one’s own nature. When the inner self is at peace, natural wholeness is realized. Thus, all things that remain whole do so through emptiness and stillness, thereby attaining their proper peace. Those that fail do so through restless seeking, thereby losing their proper place."

Lu said: "When asked why I value emptiness, I answer that there is nothing to value. What I cherish in emptiness is not for the sake of a name. Emptiness is where brightness arises and auspiciousness abides. Only in stillness and emptiness does one attain their proper place. If one indulges in grasping and giving, the spirit loses its peace, and then names, profits, right and wrong all surge forth in contention—how can one endure it? Thus, emptiness is not what *I* value."

Fan said: "Unchanging oneness is the perfection of stillness. Harmony without resistance is the perfection of emptiness. To steadfastly guard stillness and thoroughly attain emptiness—how could this concern the trivialities of fame and reputation? Within the unity of nature lies the true dwelling. Where there is a corpse, there is decay; where there is decay, there is attachment. Stillness is sufficient to respond to all movements; emptiness is sufficient to receive all realities. Stillness and emptiness do not contend with things—the true dwelling is within me, and residing in it brings peace. But if there is grasping, there is seeking; if there is giving, there is responding. The body and nature are driven astray, submerged in the myriad things. Gazing toward the old capital brings joy; pointing to the former home brings tears. Longing to return to one’s true nature yet finding no way in—is this not like an exile who has left their homeland? Though one may wish not to lose their proper place, can it be attained? This is the sorrow of those in the world who have lost their true home.

The *Book of Changes* takes the well as ‘dwelling in one’s proper place’ and *Gen* as ‘stopping in one’s proper place.’ The well is the source of nature; *Gen* is the stillness of nature. Only these do not lose their proper place. When affairs are broken and ruined, those who then perform rites of benevolence and righteousness cannot restore them. One should act before things arise and govern before disorder begins. When integrity is lost and vitality withers, then to drum up benevolence and righteousness in hopes of returning to the ultimate of nature and life—this is never attained."

*Huǐ* is pronounced *huǐ*.

Lu said: "What I speak of as emptiness is cultivated before disorder arises. If the true nature is broken and ruined, the heart-mind and spirit are muddled and confused. To then play with the teachings of benevolence and righteousness or stir the waves of human emotions is to be unable to recover."

*Zhenghe* states: "Where there is nobility, there is baseness; where there is name, there is reality. Emptiness is without these. *Laozi* says: 'Attain the utmost emptiness, guard stillness steadfastly.' Emptiness is sufficient to receive the myriad realities; stillness is sufficient to respond to the myriad movements. Thus it is said, 'Nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness.' To regard emptiness and stillness as attaining one’s proper place means that the myriad movements and realities cannot obstruct them. To regard grasping and giving as losing one’s proper place means clinging to this while rejecting that.

When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness. When affairs are broken and ruined, and only then do people perform benevolence and righteousness—how can they return to the Dao?"

Fan said: "*Zhuangzi* says, 'If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why resort to benevolence and righteousness?' For when the Dao is lost, then virtue arises; when virtue is lost, then benevolence arises; when benevolence is lost, then righteousness arises. Benevolence establishes others; righteousness establishes oneself—yet they are far removed from the Dao. When affairs are already broken and ruined, then to hobble about in benevolence and stamp about in righteousness, seeking to console the hearts of the world—all under heaven rush to respond to benevolence and righteousness, yet none can return to their nature and recover their original state. This is why the utmost persons of old struck and discarded them—there was good reason for it."

Zhou Xiong said: "The turning of the cosmos never ceases; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices? This is the meaning of *Zhuangzi*’s ‘boat and valley.’ Confucius said, 'Day and night without pause—I pass away thus.' All things take transformation as their body, and the body follows transformation in its changes. Transformation does not pause even briefly—how can things remain unchanged? Thus, the form that lived before is not the form that lives now. In the space between lowering and raising one’s head, ten thousand changes have already occurred. Qi disperses, the form decays—not suddenly in a single day, yet the deluded grasp at vessels of inevitable change, entrust themselves to ceaseless movement, and claim they can escape transformation. Is this not lamentable?"

Fan said: "Yin and yang illuminate, cover, and govern one another; the four seasons replace, give birth to, and destroy one another. The teeming myriad kinds daily pass away in a single breath. In the space of no delay, they swiftly form and swiftly decay, rise and fall in alternation, flourish and decline in succession, suddenly appear and suddenly vanish. The treasures of valleys and marshes—what is now is not what was before. In the time it takes to cross arms, it has already become an old trace. The great transformation shifts imperceptibly, yet the deluded do not know. Without penetrating the Dao of day and night, who can awaken to it?"

Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is depleted there. This is what is meant by rivers running dry and valleys emptying, hills leveling and abysses filling. Loss and fullness, completion and depletion follow the world and follow death—yet this world may also be called life. Coming and going connect without interruption, with no gap to spare—who can perceive it? One who has just achieved completion is already depleted; one who has just attained life is already secretly dead.

Fan said: When hills level and abysses fill, what is diminished there is not necessarily unfilled here. When a tree is planted and grows, what is completed here is not without depletion there. To diminish oneself is to benefit; to complete oneself is to ruin. Life and death cycle through boundless transformation; coming and going revolve through ceaseless mechanism. Day and night proceed without pause, with no interval to comb through—unless one is profoundly enlightened to the beginning and end, who can perceive the reason for this?

For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete all at once. One does not sense its completion, nor does one sense its depletion. All occurs in obscurity and transforms in secret, inherently beyond the reach of ears and eyes.

Fan said: What dissipates soon breathes its last, yet does not advance all at once. What fills soon empties its form, yet does not deplete all at once. In its advance, it daily creates what was not and delights in what is new. In its depletion, it daily reduces what was and diminishes what was completed. Though one may grasp and try to retain it, it departs from obscurity. As *Zhuangzi*’s metaphor of valleys and marshes says: "At midnight, a forceful one carries them away"—this clarifies the point.

It is like a person from birth to old age: appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change without a day’s pause. Skin, nails, and hair fall away with the world, not remaining as they were in infancy. Even the coarse aspects of form and appearance—new and old replacing each other—are unrecognizable, let alone what is subtler than this? The interval is imperceptible; one must wait until later to know.

Lu said: The mind’s subtle operation, yin and yang’s dynamic interplay—thus the body transforms, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly. Loss and gain, fullness and depletion—who can awaken to it? This is why the Dao is prized: to know the root and not grieve over loss.

*Zhenghe* states: The spirit is that which subtly governs the myriad things. If its subtlety is unknowable, then all that is bound to form, constrained by number, or confined between heaven and earth—where the revolving of the two qi never ceases and the coming and going of the myriad things never ends—cannot be grasped in its governing and unfolding. How then can one know it? Only the sage, penetrating to the source of things, awakens to this and merges with it. Those who wait until later to know are the last to awaken, if they awaken at all.

Fan said: Born between heaven and earth, once one receives one’s completed form, it does not perish until it is exhausted. The form transforms, and the mind transforms with it. Yet it rushes and gallops, unperceiving and unawakened—how can one not lose the heart of an infant? The ancients who embodied the Dao used spirit to guide form, transforming without being transformed by transformation. The four limbs and hundred parts would become dust and grime. Death and life are great indeed, yet one does not change with them. Though myriad transformations have no end, how can this weary the heart? Thus, one of profound virtue returns to the state of an infant, roaming above with the Creator and below with those who transcend life and death, equalizing beginning and end as friends.

A man of the state of Qi worried that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, forsaking sleep and food. Another, worried about his worry, went to enlighten him. The first man’s worry was deluded, yet the second, though not deluded, worried about his delusion—refusing to worry about what he worried about—only deepened the confusion. How could they enlighten each other?

He said: Heaven is but accumulated qi. There is no place without qi. Like bending and stretching, breathing in and out, one moves and rests within heaven all day—why worry about collapse? The azure of heaven is not a solid substance. Then what is called heaven—is it merely distant and without limit? From the earth upward, all is heaven. Thus, looking up and down, breathing—one never departs from heaven.

The man said: If heaven is accumulated qi, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall? The enlightener said: The sun, moon, and stars are luminous within accumulated qi. Qi is all-pervading—even the vastness of heaven and earth rests securely within the realm of the Great Void, let alone what is lifted by qi. Even if they fell, they could cause no harm.

The man said: What of the earth’s ruin? The enlightener said: The earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions. There is no place without clods. Like stepping and treading, one moves and rests upon the earth all day—why worry about its ruin? The man released his concern and rejoiced greatly. (Note: *she* should be *shi* [释], meaning "release." The enlightener, too, released his concern and rejoiced greatly.)

These two—one worrying about inevitable ruin, the other rejoicing in inevitable preservation—did not know the true cause of worry and joy. Though they consoled and enlightened each other, they remained deeply deluded.

Lu said: Heaven is accumulated qi—where is there no qi? Earth is accumulated clods—where is there no clod? Clods hide nothing; qi collapses nowhere. The sun, moon, and stars are luminous within qi—why worry about collapse?

Fan said: What stands firm and rises is heaven in motion—is it merely accumulated qi, naturally clear? If not, it might tear apart. What sinks and settles is earth in stillness—is it merely accumulated clods, naturally at peace? If not, it might erupt. Kunlun’s vastness stands as an obstruction in the Great Void. To worry about its ruin is delusion; to worry about another’s worry is even greater delusion.

To be free from delusion is to aspire to the greatest freedom from delusion.

Changluzi heard this and laughed, saying: The rainbow, the clouds and mist, the wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi that form heaven. The mountains and peaks, the rivers and seas, metal and stone, fire and wood—these are the accumulations of form that constitute earth. To know that qi accumulates and that clods accumulate—how can one then speak of indestructibility? Before the primordial chaos divided, heaven and earth were one qi, and the myriad things were one form. When they separated into heaven and earth and dispersed into the myriad things, this was merely a difference of convergence and divergence, of emptiness and fullness in form and qi. Now, heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest entity within what has form. That they are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. That they are difficult to measure, difficult to comprehend—this is certainly so. To worry about their ruin is indeed far-fetched; to claim they will not be ruined is also incorrect. Heaven and earth cannot but be ruined, and when they meet their ruin, they will return to it. When that time comes, how can one not be anxious? This is to know that what has a beginning must have an end, that what has form must be destroyed, yet not to recognize the vicissitudes of fortune and the rise and fall of yin and yang, nor the emergence and disappearance of vessels and heaven and earth.

Lu said: Qi and clods accumulate to form heaven and earth—where there is accumulation and formation, how can there be no ruin? Only because their vastness makes their end difficult to witness. Yet if one encounters their time of ruin, how can one not be anxious?

Fan said: The classic states: How do we know that the demise of heaven and earth does not give rise to something greater than heaven and earth? Viewed from within the void, they are but a tiny thing. It also states: Heaven and earth are the greatest of forms. Viewed from within what has form, they are the most immense. Because their end is difficult to exhaust, they are difficult to fathom; because they are difficult to measure, they are difficult to comprehend. To worry about their ruin is indeed far-fetched; to claim they will not be ruined is also incorrect. Yet to say that heaven and earth cannot but be ruined, and that when their time of ruin comes one should not be anxious—this places Changluzi’s words squarely in the realm of the laughable.

Master Liezi heard this and laughed, saying: To say that heaven and earth will be ruined is mistaken; to say they will not be ruined is also mistaken. Whether they are ruined or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one perspective, and this is another. That perspective speaks of indestructibility; this one speaks of ruin. If they are not ruined, they endure together with humanity; if they are ruined, they perish together with humanity. Why rejoice or grieve over this? Thus, the living do not know death, and the dead do not know life; the coming does not know the going, and the going does not know the coming. Whether ruined or not, why should I concern myself with it? Not knowing life while alive is like not knowing death while dead. When something comes into being, none know its destruction; when it is destroyed, how can one know its formation? This is the visible proof of going and coming, the clear evidence of success and failure. I accept them all—my feelings hold no distinction between them. Where is there room for concern?

Lu said: Heaven and earth are the greatest of things; the physical body is the smallest of things. The great are but one thing, and the small are but one thing. All things must be ruined—what is the use of debating it? Moreover, in life one does not know death, and in death one does not know life; coming and going are not self-aware, and formation and ruin cannot be understood. If one cannot even comprehend what is close at hand, why expend the mind on heaven and earth and worry over debates beyond the realm of things?

Zhenghe said: From the perspective of vessels, there is formation and there is ruin; from the perspective of the Dao, there is neither formation nor ruin. Those confined to vessels say that because things have form and qi, they cannot but be ruined. Those who comprehend the Dao know that they neither collapse nor fall, and thus cannot be ruined. Only the enlightened understand this passage. This is why Master Liezi has no room for concern.

Fan said: Heaven and earth within the void are like a bubble in water. Water forms its own boundary, and the bubble becomes water; when it is ruined, it is still water. It forms and is ruined in an instant, ruined and forms in an instant. The worry of the man of Qi over its ruin is like mourning the death of a person. Those who worry about what others worry about can enlighten them—this is like mourning the mourning of others. Changluzi’s laughter is like mourning those who mourn the mourning of others. Advancing further, whether ruined or not, there is no room for concern—this is the ultimate discourse. Thus, the transformations of life and death, the mechanisms of coming and going, are not sufficient to be known. Whether ruined or not, why rejoice or grieve over it?

Shun asked Zheng: Can the Dao be possessed?

Shun wished to clarify that all beings are identical to nothingness, so he took the Dao as the starting point for his question.

Zheng replied: Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?

Guo Xiang said: The body is not something you can possess; it simply exists of itself. If you do not even possess what you have, how much less can you possess what you do not have?

Lu said: You and I are merely designations for self and other in form; they do not refer to the spirit. The common people take their own bodies as "I" and others as "you." How can one hope to possess the Dao? Thus it is said: Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?

Shun said: If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?

He pressed the question further, based on the possession of this body.

Zheng replied: It is the entrusted form of heaven and earth, a partial manifestation of the one qi. Life is not your possession—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Only through the accumulation of harmony does life come to be. Fate is not your possession—it is the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. Only through the accumulation of compliance do existence and perishing come to be.

Guo Xiang said: If the body were yours to possess, then beauty and ugliness, life and death, would be determined by you. Yet qi gathers and life arises, and you cannot prevent it.

When qi scatters, death comes, and you cannot halt it. Clearly, its gathering and dissolution arise of themselves—it is not yours to possess. Your descendants are not yours to possess—they are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth, the cicada’s molt as qi gathers and disperses of itself. If they were yours to possess, then even the number of sons and daughters would be determined by you. Thus, in walking you know not where you go; in dwelling you know not what you hold; in eating you know not why. All emerges from the self-so, not from knowing or doing.

Heaven and earth are the supreme yang—qi itself. How then could they be possessed? Heaven and earth are but the greatest of all entrusted gatherings. Now, in walking, dwelling, eating, and resting, all are set in motion by the supreme yang—how could you know the reason? Supreme yang is like unyielding solidity, yet it is not the ultimate principle of unyielding solidity. When turned toward the extreme of emptiness and harmony, there is no form, no life, no death, no end. Then to what would fate and life be entrusted in compliance? To what would descendants be entrusted in shedding? Where would walking and dwelling find their mooring? On what would eating and drinking depend?

Lu said: Since the numinous clarity of the Way is unknown, one borrows heaven and earth to speak of it. Heaven governs the numinous function; earth governs forms and things. That which enters into being is the entrusted form. That which embodies harmony is the life of nature. That which responds and functions is the entrusted compliance. That which nurtures emotions is the entrusted shedding. Now, in your walking, stopping, eating, and resting, you know only the movement of the supreme yang, yet remain unaware of the true lord of numinous clarity. How then could you possess the Dao?

Someone asked: Yu and Shun were sages—how could they not know the Dao?

The answer: When borrowing guest and host to dispel confusion, how could one remain in silent mystery alone? Yet *Zhuangzi* says: "The ruler of Liang possesses a sage’s talent but not a sage’s Dao; I possess a sage’s Dao but not a sage’s talent." Thus, one who has the talent to aid the world and occupies the highest position may not necessarily know the Dao. One who dwells in the mountains and forests with a reputation for solitary integrity may not necessarily govern others.

Thus, after thirty years on the throne, the Yellow Emperor dreamed of the Land of Huaxu; only after Yao met the Four Masters did he gaze in wonder upon the southern banks of the Fen River. How then could it be strange that Shun had not yet awakened?

In *Zhenghe* it is said: Emptiness is loss, fullness is possession—whatever is grasped and held is subject to being seized. The Dao’s subtlety is formless, its depth unknowable. Since it cannot be possessed, how then can the human body—with its form, nature, and life—claim to endure when it arises and vanishes in an instant?

The body is but a vessel, and thus one’s person is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Harmony is qi, and thus life is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted harmony. The birth of things follows the principle of nature and life, and thus nature and life are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance. The body is the legacy of one’s parents, and thus descendants are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted shedding. If this is so, then none of it is truly one’s own. Thus, in walking one knows not where one goes, in dwelling one knows not what one holds, in eating one knows not the taste. There is indeed one who governs this, one who commands it—nothing more than the supreme yang of Heaven and Earth, the movement of qi alone. How then could one possess the Dao?

Yet the Dao is the shared path of all people. Thus it is said: “The Dao will make a dwelling for you.” Could it then remain forever unpossessable? To claim possession is to lose it; only the sage possesses it by not possessing.

Master Fan said: The Dao is originally without substance, and your body is also empty. If emptiness is not possession, where then could the Dao reside? Thus, of all things under Heaven, what you claim to possess most exclusively is your own body; of all that abides within the body, nothing is more precious than life; of the root of life, nothing is more fundamental than nature and destiny; of all that is closest to the body, nothing is dearer than one’s descendants. Yet you cannot truly possess any of these. Therefore, observing your own body, you see that it is fundamentally without knowledge: in walking, how could you know where you go? In dwelling, how could you know what you hold? In eating, how could you know the taste? All is but the supreme yang of Heaven and Earth, the workings of qi. How then could you claim to possess the Dao?

In Qi, the Guo family was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang family was desperately poor. Traveling from Song to Qi, Xiang sought their method. Guo told him: “I am skilled in theft.” When I first began stealing, I had enough after one year, sufficiency after two, and great abundance after three. From then on, my bounty extended to towns and villages. Overjoyed, Xiang grasped the words of theft but not the Dao of theft. He scaled walls, broke through chambers, and seized whatever his hands and eyes reached. Before long, he was caught with stolen goods and forfeited his ancestral wealth. Believing Guo had deceived him, Xiang went to complain. Guo said: “How did you steal?” Xiang described what he had done. Guo said: “Alas! Have you lost the Dao of theft to this extent? Now I will tell you.

I have heard that Heaven has its seasons, Earth its advantages. Spring, autumn, winter, summer—each region yields what it produces. I steal Heaven and Earth’s timely benefits, the soaking rains of clouds, the nurturing bounty of mountains and marshes, to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, I steal from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of Heaven. How could they be mine? Heaven cannot even produce itself—how could it produce things? People cannot even possess themselves—how could they possess things? This is to make clear that all things arise and possess themselves.

Yet when I steal from Heaven, I incur no misfortune. Heaven does not withhold its gifts, and I act with impartiality—where then could resentment arise? Gold, jade, treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people amass. How could they be Heaven’s to give? If Heaven cannot give them, how can people amass them? This too makes clear that all things gather themselves. If you steal them and incur punishment, whom should you resent?

People possess their wealth, and I violate their private holdings—this is why you bring trouble upon yourself.”

Master Lu said: Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. Devoid of feeling in their nurturing, how could they have intent in giving or taking? The great consume the small, the clever exploit the foolish. Seizing opportunities to pursue profit, using force to serve private ends, all actions of taking and giving are theft. Yet when people hoard wealth, they do not act as its true masters. To take from them and be punished—whom else could you resent?

Master Fan said: Theft arises from covetous ambition, taking what is not one’s own. Yet there is what is called public theft and what is called private theft. Grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are born of Heaven—Guo stole from them and incurred no misfortune. Gold, jade, treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are amassed by people—Xiang stole from them and was punished. Though the two differ, to take what is not one’s own is the same.

Bewildered, Xiang believed Guo had gravely deceived him. He encountered Master Dongguo and asked him about it. Master Dongguo said: “Is not your very body itself theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to form your life, to bear your form—how much more are external things not theft? If theft exists, then my body is but one thing among Heaven and Earth’s myriad things, and I cannot but claim it as my own. If theft does not exist, then inner and outer cannot differ. Truly, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To measure and claim possession is delusion.

Heaven and Earth are the collective name of the myriad things; the myriad things are the alternate name of Heaven and Earth. Though each claims its own body, in principle they are not separate. To measure and claim possession is delusion. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form is not mine. To adorn and cherish appearances, to boast and flaunt wisdom and ability—this is delusion.”

As for those who go to extremes, they arbitrarily measure and claim external things as their own, even inscribing names to set themselves apart, relying on kin to secure their position, adorning their robes to dazzle others, leveraging rank and status to sway the masses, amassing wealth and property, and establishing factions of power—all their lives they delight in such playthings, never awakening to the truth. Thus *Laozi* says: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.” *Zhuangzi* says: “Of my hundred bones and six viscera, with whom shall I be intimate?” Grasping this principle, the mind’s square inch is as empty as the primordial void, and the bodily form exists equally among the myriad things.

Fan says: “To claim possession, whether great or small, is delusion.” Xiang’s parable speaks of theft in word but not of the Dao of theft, thus erring in pursuing wealth. Guo’s parable speaks of the Dao of theft but not of the reason for theft, thus erring in being burdened by things. If one attains the Dao, even the body within cannot be arbitrarily claimed as one’s own—how much less the myriad external things? Why? When a person is born, their hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera all exist together. With whom shall I be intimate? To recognize and claim them is great delusion. Only by not allowing profit to burden the form, nor the form to burden the mind, can one see that the myriad things and the self cannot be distinguished—when I have no self, what trouble can I have?

Guo’s theft is the public Dao, thus incurring no misfortune; Xiang’s theft is private desire, thus incurring guilt. “Public” is the opposite of “private”; without private desire, the name “public” vanishes. Now to call violating Heaven “public” and violating man “private” is not the ultimate principle. Lu says: “Heaven and Earth are without private desire; to take from them is without opposition, thus incurring no misfortune. The human heart has private desire; to take with attachment is theft. To take what is privately desired with a heart of private desire—private desire has its opposite, so how can guilt be doubted?” Thus, the law forbids private desire; without opposition, there is no prohibition. Those who act with public or private intent are still thieves—only the object of violation differs, not the nature of theft. Those who transcend public and private are also thieves. The body cannot but exist, and wealth cannot but be gathered; to then seek to abandon them is not the same as being without attachment from the outset.

Lu says: “The sage establishes laws and teachings, harming none and encroaching not upon the multitude—this is not theft. Those who do not violate the law act by the public Dao; those who violate the law act by the private Dao. Even if one does not violate the public but claims things for oneself, it is still theft—how much more so to violate the law and claim for oneself?” Public and private are the virtues of Heaven and Earth. Life is one principle of Heaven and Earth; the body is one thing among Heaven and Earth’s myriad things. What one now covets and clings to is but coveting and clinging to the life and body born between Heaven and Earth. In affairs, there is no public or private; in principle, there is no coveting or clinging. One who knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth—who is a thief? Who is not a thief? What is the virtue of Heaven and Earth? It is simply spontaneity. Where does it pass through the names of public and private? Once the names of public and private are abolished, theft and non-theft are without distinction in principle.

Lu says: “To know public and private yet be without private desire, to be of the same pattern as things without finding it strange—this is the virtue of Heaven and Earth. If one knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth and takes without private desire, this is not deceiving Heaven. To take without differing from others, to obtain without private desire, is not theft. If so, who is a thief? Who is not a thief? Only those who thoroughly comprehend the spirit and awaken to the Dao know this.”

*Zhenghe* says: “To take what is not one’s own is nothing but theft. Some act by the public Dao and incur no misfortune; others act by private desire and incur guilt—the difference lies in whether one is burdened by possession or by recognizing and claiming possession. Yet those who act with public or private intent cannot be without attachment, thus it is said: those with public or private intent are also thieves. Those who transcend public and private cannot be without lingering attachment, thus it is said: those who have transcended public and private are also thieves. To act with public or private intent as it arises naturally, without contrivance—this is to embrace the myriad things, which is called the virtue of Heaven and Earth. One who knows this merges into great unity. Though things differ in shape and form, they unite with Heaven and Earth. How can I discern their distinctions? Thus the chapter *Heavenly Auspices* concludes.”

Fan says: “To act for oneself is private; to turn away from private desire is public. Public originally has no name; it is only through private desire that it is known. When Heaven follows principle, it is vast and public—thus Guo’s theft of what Heaven produces is the public Dao. When man follows emotion, it is petty and private—thus Xiang’s theft of what man possesses is private desire. From the perspective of the Dao, both are partial. Those who act with public or private intent are thieves; those who transcend public and private are also thieves. Public and private are the virtues of Heaven and Earth. The sage does not discard either. Awakening to this and merging into obscurity, how can one discern the distinction between theft and non-theft?”

*The Four Explanations of the* Perfect Virtue of the Pristine Dao, *Volume Three* concludes.
*The Four Explanations of the* Perfect Virtue of the Pristine Dao, *Volume Four*

The *Harmonious Radiance Scattered One*, Gao Shouyuan, compiled:

What the Yellow Emperor received at birth is called *nature*; attaining the utmost of nature is called *harmony*. Thus, responding to principle and dwelling in compliance, one’s path is ever unobstructed; following emotion and turning from the Dao, one encounters things and is impeded.

Lu says: This clarifies forgetting form to nurture spirit, following profound silence to manifest true wisdom. At the outset of nurturing, one relinquishes the myriad existences to inwardly clarify the heart-mind; when wisdom is manifested, one transforms all living beings outwardly to engage with things. Thus, in its beginning, one purifies the heart-mind and disciplines the body, not mingling in governance; in its final chapter, one praises Confucius and Mozi to aid humanity. Such is its great purport.

In governance and harmony, those of old who illuminated the great Dao first clarified Heaven, then followed with virtue and the Dao. *Liezi* begins with *Heavenly Omens* and is followed by *The Yellow Emperor*—could this be the reason?

Fan says: The self-emptiness of the non-substantial flows unimpeded everywhere; clinging to the substantiality of things, one meets obstacles at every turn. Then is it easier to act from having? One must dissolve the heart-mind of right and wrong, gain and loss, abandon the fervor of cunning and decisiveness, uproot suspicion and anxiety, so that things cannot harm one’s essence, nor can others precede one. Rejecting the conduct of self-aggrandizement and upholding the constant Dao of victory, if you apply this among men, the afflictions of the human realm may well cease. The Land of Huaxu, the Mountain of Guye—are they far away? Such is the purport of this chapter.

Emperor Huangdi, having reigned fifteen years, rejoiced that all under heaven bore him allegiance—yet this was but worldly joy. He cultivated the mandate of correctness, which is precisely the cultivation of one’s nature. He delighted the ears and eyes, gratified the nose and mouth, yet his complexion withered and darkened, his five emotions grew dull and confused. The toil of heart and wit was insufficient to nurture his nature and life—it only sufficed to wither his form.

Lu says: The people of his age all sought to nourish their bodies with sounds and sights, with food and drink; only those of abundant means were deemed noble and wealthy. Yet the sage knew this path was enough to harm life, and so he grew withered and joyless.

The first chapter reveals the spirit as the master of life; the second seeks to clarify the Dao for nurturing the body. Thus it first shows what the multitude drowns in, then gradually guides them forward.

After another fifteen years, he grew anxious that all under heaven remained untended—yet this was but worldly anxiety. He exhausted his keen hearing and bright vision, advanced his wit and strength, and busied himself for the hundred clans. Again his complexion withered and darkened, his five emotions grew dull and confused. The use of keen hearing and bright vision was insufficient for governance—it only sufficed to disorder the spirit.

Lu says: Those of his age called themselves "noble men," scholars who ordered others. All wearied their hearts and wore themselves out, sacrificing their bodies for things, seeking fame and pursuing profit. Yet they knew not that toil of the spirit forfeits reality, and thus they drifted ever farther from the Dao.

Yellow Emperor then sighed in admiration—*sighed* should read *lamented*. "My errors run deep indeed—*deep* should read *excessive*. To nurture the self alone brings such calamity; to govern the myriad things brings such calamity. Only by entrusting without nurturing, by indulging without governing, may one’s nature and life remain whole, and all under heaven rest in peace."

Lu says: *Excessive* means straying from the Dao. All living things know to nurture themselves, selfishly preserving their lives, yet they know not that what gives life also leads to death. Those who grasp at benevolence and righteousness all know to pursue fame for profit, selfishly believing themselves capable, yet they know not how this exhausts the spirit, harms life, and hastens death. To serve the self and act selfishly is the way of the petty man; to aid others without selfishness is the way of the noble man. Outwardly, goodness and evil appear distinct, yet inwardly, the pursuit of fame and loss of reality both end in ruin. Now that the great Dao is made clear, both are condemned.

Fan says: To animate the myriad things without sharing the sage’s anxieties—this is the Dao. To share the people’s fortunes in good and ill—this is worldly affairs. Embracing the Dao, one knows no sorrow; engaging in affairs, one meets with calamity. The sage governs all under heaven only when unavoidable—how could he do so with indifference? Inwardly nurturing the self means preserving the true mandate, delighting the ears and eyes, sating the mouth and nose—yet its calamities are already thus. Outwardly governing the myriad things means exhausting keen hearing and bright vision, advancing wit and strength, and busying oneself for the hundred clans—its calamities are again thus. How could such trivial skills, which bind the body and startle the heart, inherently entail such manifold sorrows? Only when one takes the people’s heart as one’s own heart must one also share what they fear.

Thus, he set aside the myriad affairs, forsook the palace chambers, dismissed his attendants; stilled the bells and chimes, reduced the royal fare, and withdrew to dwell in leisure within the Hall of the Great Court. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form—his heart free of desire, his form naturally compliant. For three months, he did not attend to governance.

Lu said: To set aside the myriad affairs does not mean doing nothing at all. Matters arise and are met as the four seasons turn. Thus it is said: What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born—yet it does not toil in anxious thought to court empty fame, nor scheme for ability across a thousand ages to leave a fragrant name upon bamboo and silk. Rather, it responds in profound obscurity, moved only by necessity, neither exalting its own name nor increasing its cravings, neither enriching its flavors nor indulging in wanton sounds. It purifies the heart and subdues the body. Three months is but one season. Confucius said: Yan Hui did not stray from benevolence for three months—this is the same. Selecting worthy talents and entrusting them with rewards and punishments without partiality—this is not attending to governance oneself.

In daytime repose, he dreamed. Profound truths cannot be sought through emotion, so they are entrusted to dreams. The sage has no dreams. He wandered in the land of Huaxu. In perfect harmony: the perfected one does not burden the form with things, nor burden the heart with the form; above, he roams with the Creator, below, he befriends those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. Sorrow and joy do not alter him—what calamity could there be? The Yellow Emperor, by this means, cast off the burdens of the myriad things and returned to the One. Thus, purifying the heart and disciplining the form, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu.

Fan said: The governance of the sage, though daily handling ten thousand details, now setting aside the myriad affairs, no longer wearies the heart over the least trifles. Forsaking the palace chambers is not attachment to the comfort of dwelling; dismissing attendants is not delight in the multitude of servants. Stilling the bells and chimes, the ear is not ensnared by sound; reducing the royal fare, the mouth is not ensnared by taste. Withdrawing to dwell in leisure within the Hall of the Great Court, purifying the heart and disciplining the form, for three months not attending to governance—this is the utmost purity of fasting. Thus, the land of Huaxu is attained in dream.

The Classic says: When form meets, it is affairs; when spirit encounters, it is dream. All that one does must manifest in dream—thus the communion of the hun in sleep is not necessarily empty. All that one dreams at night must accord with the day—thus the awakening of the form is not necessarily real. Only one who comprehends the Way of day and night can know this. Merging dream and waking into one, regarding the world’s gains and losses, right and wrong, nobility and baseness, life and death as no more than dream and illusion—thus, dwelling in the palace of the transformed man, one wanders in dream; serving as the steward of Yin, one finds joy in dream; obtaining the deer of the man of Zheng, one litigates in dream. Whatever one encounters, one accepts—knowing it is illusion, not real. Why doubt this alone?

Yet the true person of old, in sleep, had no dreams. Liezi speaks of this to clarify that the utmost Dao cannot be sought through emotion, and so provisionally entrusts it to dream. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture. It need not actually exist—it merely illustrates that the utmost principle must be thus. *Huainanzi* says: Due west is Yan Prefecture, northwest is Tai Prefecture. How many thousands of miles distant is this land? *Si* means "apart," *qi* means "center." It is beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot—only spirit may roam there. Boats, carriages, and feet are but the resources of form; the spirit’s way is subtle and indistinct, arriving without traveling.

Fan said: *Hua* means "to unfold and depart from the root," *xu* means "to emerge and meet." The principle is supremely subtle, yet need not be sought in the depths of darkness and silence. Though departing from the root of the Dao, it meets with things—this is what is meant by "returning to the root and recovering the mandate," which remains ever thus. Due west is Yan Prefecture, due north is Tai Prefecture; west of Yan and north of Tai is the place of returning to the root and recovering the mandate.

When the Dao descends to the mean, even those with feet may reach the mound. How many thousands of miles distant is this land? It is far removed from humanity—beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot, only spirit may roam there. Only spirit—swift without haste, arriving without traveling—thus it enters and exits the six directions, roams in the realm of nothingness. Where could it not go in leisure?

In that land, there are no teachers or leaders—only spontaneity. Its people have no cravings—only spontaneity. Spontaneity does not rely on externals. They do not know joy in life, nor aversion to death—thus no premature deaths; they do not know closeness to self, nor distance from things—thus no love or hatred; they do not know opposition or compliance—thus no benefit or harm. Principle knows no life or death—thus no joy or aversion; principle knows no love or hatred—thus no closeness or distance; principle knows no opposition or compliance—thus no benefit or harm. They cherish nothing, fear nothing. Entering water, they do not drown; entering fire, they do not burn; struck or flogged, they feel no pain; pricked or prodded, they feel no itch. In perfect harmony, nothing can harm them—heat, drowning, pain, or itch. In truth, these arise from anxiety and fear; the principles are detailed in the following chapter. *Xiao yang* means "aching itch," as explained in the *Rites of Zhou*.

They tread the void as if on solid ground, sleep in emptiness as if on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their sight, thunder and lightning do not disturb their hearing, beauty and ugliness do not confuse their hearts, mountains and valleys do not trip their steps—only spirit moves. In perfect compliance, nothing can oppose them.

Lu said: This is metaphorical speech. Purifying the heart and disciplining the form, when spirit unites with the Dao, one attains that great land. Spirit is the master of life. As the master of life, it governs spirit to nurture life. If nurturing is contrary to principle, it becomes harm instead.

The vulgar mistake indulgence in desires for nurturing life, yet this is precisely the root of premature death. Thus the noble person nurtures their nature, while the petty person nurtures their emotions. To nurture one’s nature is to be free of cravings, to preserve the natural, to feel no joy in life nor aversion to death, to hold no preferences or aversions, no fears or taboos—simply following the natural. One whose spirit moves is one whose spirit unites with the Dao. This is not some separate realm or distinct kind of person.

Thus it is said: the Way of humaneness is not distant—practice it and you arrive. A single word in accord, and you grasp it in an instant. *Zhenghe* lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, thousands of miles from the state of Qi—its Way is secluded and boundless. Only those who wander in spirit can reach it. Without teachers or superiors, they govern themselves; without cravings, they are self-sufficient. Life and death bring no change to them, near and far impose no burden on their bodies. They do not pursue profit, yet profit does not come; they do not resist harm, yet harm does not arrive. They cherish nothing, fear nothing, and their hearts forget all things. They enter water yet do not drown, enter fire yet do not burn, suffer blows without pain, endure scratches without itching. Their forms are left behind, they tread the void and sleep in emptiness, unobstructed and untroubled. Wherever they go, they have no leisure—thus they come and go through the realms of yin and yang, beyond all reckoning, let alone human comprehension. This is what is meant by "spirit moving alone."

Fan said: In that land, there are no teachers or superiors—all is natural. Thus there is no labor of governance, yet the state governs itself. Its people have no cravings—all is natural. Thus there are no greedy impulses, and the people remain unspoiled. They do not know life in death, nor death in life, so they feel no joy in departure nor resistance to return. Who then could fear early death? They see others as themselves and themselves as others, so there is nothing too intimate, nothing too distant. Who then could harbor love or hatred? Anger arises from opposition, joy from compliance—so they do not turn away from difference nor incline toward sameness. Who then could be swayed by profit or harm? Free of love and hatred, their hearts know nothing; free of fear and taboo, their forms feel no alarm. Such beings are untouched by the greatest floods, though they reach the heavens; unburned by the fiercest droughts, though metal and stone melt and mountains wither. Though assailed by the brave, blades cannot pierce them; though struck by the strong, blows cannot land. They touch solidity yet are unobstructed, tread emptiness yet do not fall. They see without eyes, hear without ears. Their hearts are hollowed of all things—beauty and ugliness cannot disturb them. They move in concealment yet are not stifled; mountains and valleys cannot trip their steps. Their comings and goings are inexhaustible—such is the work of their spirit.

The Yellow Emperor, having awakened, knew this was but a dream—yet the sage is never truly asleep or awake. Serene and self-content, he summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji—his three ministers—and said: "I have heard that after three months of purifying the heart and disciplining the form, one should seek the Way to nurture the self and govern all things, yet I have not attained its method. The self cannot be nurtured, things cannot be governed, and though I have sought it with utmost diligence, I have not found it. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have understood, I have attained it—but I cannot explain it to you. If it cannot be sought through emotion, then it cannot be conveyed through emotion."

Twenty-eight years later, the realm was greatly ordered, nearly like the land of Hua Xu. *Zhenghe*: Toil of form and agitation of heart, to know and debate—thus the method was not attained. Purification of heart and discipline of form, awakening to the obscure—thus the Way was obtained. Though it has reality and truth, it

The people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.

Lu said: Having awakened to the Dao, one no longer relies on external things to attain it. Exhaustion leading to sleep is obscurity in principle, the abandonment of desires. The spirit of consciousness returns to its nature—this cannot be sought through emotion. That it cannot be conveyed to you is because the heart is stilled and words forgotten. All who govern the world through calculation merely achieve an empty name; when calculation reaches its limit, traces become visible, and what is empty cannot be made real. Those above demand empty names from those below, and those below respond with empty names to those above—superior and inferior deceive one another, accumulating emptiness as governance. How then can one seek purity and simplicity?

The Dao is a spiritual union with principle, responding to things with truth. It does not favor petty virtues nor rage at minor faults. Like spring spreading over all things, giving life, customs transform and winds shift—naturally and imperceptibly, without knowing how transformation occurs or how completion is achieved. Thus the people long for it, unaware of its limits.

Fan said: To have a body is to be burdened by things and lose the self. Turning inward to observe the body, one finds the body fundamentally non-existent; yet if one insists on nurturing it, one has not departed from the body. Looking outward to observe things, one finds things fundamentally non-existent; yet if one insists on governing them, one has not departed from things. Seeing neither self nor other, one drifts far from the Dao. Why? The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate is dim and silent. Sought through emotion, the Dao will never be attained. What enables one to know it is no-knowledge; what enables one to attain it is no-attainment. Knowing is fundamentally no-knowledge; attainment is fundamentally no-attainment—how then could one convey this to others?

Truly understanding this, one roams the heart in blandness, unites qi in vastness, follows the natural course of things, and admits no selfishness—thus the world is ordered. After a thousand years, weary of the world, one departs to become an immortal of the highest realm, releasing the bow and ascending in transcendence. People follow this path—who would still take things as their concern?

I have examined the writings of Zhuang Zhou, who said that the Yellow Emperor first disturbed the human heart with benevolence and righteousness, then later inquired of Guangchengzi about the Dao, suggesting that only by abandoning sagacity and discarding knowledge could the world be ordered. Thus the Yellow Emperor, the so-called disturber of the human heart, must have been speaking in allegory. The meaning of this text aligns precisely with that.

Mount Liegu in the midst of the sea and rivers is recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Upon it dwells a divine person—serene and still, hence called a divine person. They inhale wind and drink dew, eating no grain; having abandoned grain, why would they still need to inhale wind or drink dew? This describes the appearance of breath cultivation, no different from other things. Their heart is like a deep spring, their form like a maiden—having reached the ultimate of softness and emptiness, their natural endowment is pure, not declining through cultivation. They show no partiality or attachment—partiality is also attachment—treating all things like straw dogs, with no favoritism. Immortals and sages serve as their ministers; immortals are the traces of long life, sages the names of ordered governance. They show no fear or anger, and the sincere and guileless serve them. How could there be any lordship or servitude here? High and low, long and short, each occupies its proper place—this is merely a figurative expression.

They do not bestow favors, yet all things are sufficient; they do not hoard or accumulate, yet nothing is lacking. Yin and yang are always harmonious, sun and moon always bright, the four seasons always in order, winds and rains always balanced, nurturing always timely, grains always abundant. The land knows no pestilence, people no premature death or misfortune, things no blemish or plague, and ghosts no supernatural manifestations. Heaven and humanity unite in virtue, yin and yang follow their sequence, darkness and light observe their measure, and disasters do not arise. Thus the Dao harmonizes the two modes and accords with the four seasons. As *Laozi* says: "Those who govern the world with the Dao—ghosts have no spirit."

Lu said: This speaks of the spirit uniting with the Dao, hence it borrows from the midst of what lies beyond form, designating it as a divine person. It does not rely on grain for nourishment but preserves wholeness through the inhalation and exhalation of true qi. The heart is like still water, incapable of stirring waves in the form; like a maiden, free from the entanglements of thought. Joy and anger do not enter their breast, right and wrong do not interfere with their function. Without seeking or desiring, they align with Heaven and Earth’s non-benevolence; without bestowing or giving, they rectify the generation of the myriad things by yin and yang, which cannot disturb them. Ghosts and spirits cannot attest to their truth—such is their achievement.

*Zhenghe*: The spirit is that which subtly brings forth the myriad things. Embodying the spirit’s subtlety and transcending form and calculation, one can overcome things without burden. Inhaling wind and drinking dew, eating no grain, one is not intent on nourishment. The heart like a deep spring, the form like a maiden—one is tranquil and undivided. Showing no partiality or attachment, immortals and sages serve as ministers; showing no fear or anger, the sincere and guileless serve them—thus one moves in harmony with the Dao. Such a one acts with ease and non-action, and yin and yang are harmonious and still; the multitude of beings is unharmed. Thus they do not bestow or favor, do not hoard or accumulate. Yin and yang are harmonious, the four seasons are in order, nurturing is timely, grains are abundant, people know no premature death or misfortune, things know no blemish or plague, and ghosts know no supernatural manifestations. This is how the sage subtly completes the myriad things without omission.

Fan said: The spirit is that which subtly brings forth the myriad things. The myriad things are at the end of the Dao. Those who embody the spirit dwell above the myriad things, seeing nothing in them that could disturb their heart—thus they overcome things without burden. If not a divine person, who could dwell on Mount Liegu? Inhaling wind and drinking dew, eating no grain, they are not intent on nourishment. The heart like a deep spring is still and reverent, not flowing; the form like a maiden is soft and compliant, without resistance.

Neither clinging nor coveting, they do not cultivate favor to draw near, yet immortals and sages truly establish this as their rule. Neither fearing nor resenting, they do not commit wrongs to estrange, yet the sincere and guileless truly serve as their instruments—detached from all things. They bestow no favors, yet all things naturally prosper; they take nothing for themselves. The Dao suffices to command yin and yang, so yin and yang remain harmonious, free from calamities of disorder. The Dao suffices to assist the sun and moon, so sun and moon remain luminous, free from eclipses or dimming. Moving the numbers with the Dao, one accords with the four seasons. Moving the qi with the Dao, one equalizes wind and rain. Thus, they never disrupt the tranquility of the six qi in nurturing all living beings, yet their nurturing is always timely. They never seize the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains, yet the harvests are always abundant, and the soil suffers no blight. People delight in their lives, knowing no premature death or misfortune, and fulfill their destinies. Things attain their natures, free from plague or blemish. Ghosts lose their numinosity, emitting no supernatural manifestations. This is the Dao—who but the most divine under heaven could partake in this?

Liezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi, advancing in the Way of these two masters until he could ride the wind and return. *Zhuangzi* says: Liezi traveled by riding the wind, soaring lightly and gracefully, returning after fifteen days. This is how the divine person, Yu Kou, described him.

Lu said: When the spirit is mired in being, the hundred limbs are all obstructed; when the spirit accords with the true, the five senses are all unobstructed. With unobstructedness, nothing is too distant to perceive; with no impediments, one rides the wind and travels. Those who don feathered robes to come and go, or entrust themselves to scales and fur to leap and bound, do so as a matter of constant principle—not because they prize the extraordinary, but because this is the meaning of their allegory.

*Zhenghe* says: The Classic states: "The good traveler leaves no tracks." Though riding the wind leaves no visible trace, it still depends on something. Only the spirit arrives without moving.

Yin Sheng, having heard of this, went to live with Liezi. For months, he did not return home. He then asked repeatedly to be taught the art, but after ten requests, Liezi refused ten times. Yin Sheng grew resentful and asked to leave, but Liezi gave no command. Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his resolve unbroken, he returned again. Liezi said: "Why do you come and go so frequently?"

Yin Sheng replied: "Formerly, Zhang Dai (Yin Sheng’s courtesy name) made a request of you, but you did not grant it, so I harbored resentment. Now, my heart is suddenly at ease, so I have come again."

Liezi said: "Before, I took you for one who understood. Now, do you show such vulgarity? Ji, I will tell you what I learned from my master."

*Zhenghe* says: Three questions met with no answer; ten requests met with no teaching—the Dao cannot truly be spoken. In the end, he told him only what he had learned from his master.

Fan said: The Dao does not answer questions; questions receive no response. Thus, the ancients had those who asked three times and received three "I do not know"s, or four times and four refusals. With Yin Sheng and Liezi, ten requests went unanswered—was this not because he wished him to grasp the Dao through his own heart and silently comprehend it? Yet he grew resentful, even indignant enough to ask to leave—how could his vulgarity be so great? Thus, Liezi had no choice but to tell him what he had learned, as if speaking without speaking.

Lu said: When you left before, I thought you had grasped my Way. Now, seeing you return to assuage your resentment, I know your shallowness.

Since I began serving my master (referring to Lao Shang) and befriending such a one (referring to Bo Gaozi), after three years, my heart dared not entertain thoughts of right or wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit or harm—only then did my master deign to glance at me once. Truly harboring profit and harm yet not daring to speak is to conceal resentment and hide one’s feelings, so he merely glanced.

Lu said: Devoted and unwavering in reverence, one seeks only to observe my form and study my conduct.

After five years, my heart *geng*-thought of right and wrong, my mouth *geng*-spoke of profit and harm (*geng* should read *geng*, "again"). Only then did my master relax his expression and smile. Right and wrong, profit and harm are the common principles of the world—letting the heart think as it will, the mouth speak as it will, without arrogance or stinginess in the breast, inner and outer as one—is this not far beyond concealing and not revealing? Delighted by this restraint, he smiled in passing.

Lu said: After three years, devoted to stillness, he merely glanced. After five years, transcending devotion, his smile became clear.

After seven years, following the heart’s thoughts, *geng* without right or wrong; following the mouth’s words, *geng* without profit or harm—only then did my master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat. What is the heart? It is stillness without intention or thought.

What is the mouth? It is silence that naturally inhales and exhales. If one follows the heart’s utmost, then there is no right or wrong; if one follows the principle of the mouth, then there is no profit or harm. When the Dao harmonizes with master and friend, standing side by side in the same position, this is fitting.

Lu said: Examine carefully before speaking to ensure right and wrong, profit and harm do not lead one astray. After nine years, whether the heart’s thoughts are unrestrained or the mouth’s words are unchecked, one no longer knows one’s own right or wrong, profit or harm, nor that of others; one no longer knows the master as one’s teacher or others as one’s friends—inner and outer have advanced. Since the heart has no thoughts and the mouth no contradictions, one may indulge in thoughts and give free rein to speech, embodying the Dao and exhausting its essence, becoming a bridge for the world. Though one thinks all day, it is not one’s own thought; though one speaks all day, it is not one’s own speech. If one takes non-thought as thought and non-speech as speech, one has not yet reached the ultimate. The saying “non-action yet nothing is left undone” is like this—where then can one seek the difference between self and other? Where can the relationship between teacher and disciple be applied? Thus it is said: inner and outer are complete.

Lu said: With no heart at all, right and wrong, profit and harm are not chosen before speaking—words flow freely. When the heart is unrestrained and speech follows, all accords with this Dao.

Fan said: The manifestation of right and wrong is how the Dao becomes deficient; the arising of profit and harm is how emotions and falsity become entangled. In Liezi’s study, after three years, the heart dared not think of right or wrong, yet the heart still chose what to think; the mouth did not speak of profit or harm, yet the mouth still chose what to say. Thus, he merely received a glance from the master—yet the Dao resided in that instant of eye contact. After five years, the heart *geng* thought of right and wrong, so the heart no longer chose, though it had not yet dissolved right and wrong; the mouth *geng* spoke of profit and harm, so the mouth no longer selected, though it had not yet forgotten profit and harm. Thus, the master first relaxed his expression and smiled—his heart was in perfect accord. After seven years, following the heart’s unrestrained thoughts, *geng* without right or wrong, right and wrong were dissolved, though one had not yet reached non-thought; following the mouth’s unchecked speech, *geng* without profit or harm, profit and harm were forgotten, though one had not yet reached non-speech. Thus, the master first drew him to sit beside him on the same mat—understanding passed between them in an instant. When the heart’s thoughts are unrestrained, thought arises from non-thought; when the mouth’s speech is unchecked, speech arises from non-speech. Who is right, who is wrong? What is profit, what is harm? Self and other are both forgotten, merging into the Dao—how then could one know the master as one’s teacher or others as one’s friends?

The sequence begins with one, progresses through five, culminates at seven, and reaches completion at nine. Those who studied the Dao in ancient times: some attained mastery over life after nine days, some resolved their doubts after nine transmissions, some achieved great subtlety after nine years. This is because the order of entering the Dao reaches its end here, advancing into the realm beyond calculation. Thereafter, the eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth—all are the same.

Lu said: The eye, ear, mouth, and nose do not employ their usual functions; each is entrusted without the heart’s involvement—thus it is said they are no different.

The heart congeals, the form dissolves, bones and flesh completely fuse. One does not sense the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a dry leaf or husk. Does the wind ride me, or do I ride the wind? The eye, ear, nose, and mouth each have their appointed roles. When spirit congeals and form is abandoned, with no reliance on externals, then sight and hearing do not depend on the eyes and ears, scents and tastes do not rely on the nose and mouth. Thus, the six viscera and seven orifices, the four limbs and hundred joints, sit inert as a corpse, all becoming one thing. Where then does the body lean? Where do the feet tread? Whether I ride the wind or the wind rides me—who can distinguish?

Lu said: When spirit congeals, it does not move. When form dissolves, it is without obstruction. When bones and flesh completely fuse, one forgets the physical frame. Forgetting the frame’s destination, the spirit’s thoughts detach from attachment—then one rises and falls with the wind and air.

*Zhenghe* says: After three years, one is no longer deluded, so the master first glanced. After five years, one is no longer obscured, so he relaxed his expression and smiled. After seven years, one is no longer burdened, so he drew him to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, right and wrong, profit and harm cannot be distinguished—self and other are both forgotten, the five senses interpenetrate, the wind rides me, I ride the wind—where is there room for the heart’s involvement?

If you dwell in the master’s gate but have not yet passed a full cycle of time, yet resentment and grievance arise again and again—your single limb will not be borne by qi, your single joint will not be supported by the earth. Employing emotion and possessing a body, flesh and bone cannot coexist; the whole being will have nowhere to reside—how could heaven and earth cover and bear it? How could one approach riding the void and mounting the wind?

Yin was greatly alarmed, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.

Lu said: Liezi could ride the wind because he forgot his body. *Laozi* says: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I no longer had a body, what trouble would I have?” If one does not forget the physical frame, then the weight of a single joint is more than the earth can bear—how could one have leisure to ride the wind and soar through the void?

*Zhenghe* says: Those who attain the Dao forget the heart—how much more should they forget resentment and grievance? If a single limb is not borne by qi and a single joint is not supported by the earth, then your body will no longer be yours—how could you possess the Dao?

Fan said: When the six senses interpenetrate, all things communicate; when the six apertures conflict, all things are obstructed.

Those who advance in the Dao have eyes like ears, ears like noses, noses like mouths—unaware of how they see or hear, unaware of what they take in or taste, all merging seamlessly without the slightest doubt in the heart. Like dead ashes, the form is released; like withered wood, flesh and bone dissolve entirely, and one enters the great communion.

Thus, when the body leans, it leans without knowing the body; when the feet step, they step without knowing the feet. Drifting east and west with the wind, like a leaf or a dried husk. Then, in movement, the heavenly mechanism flows without tracks or traces—whether the wind rides me or I ride the wind, how can one distinguish the difference?

Liezi’s attainment of the Dao reached this point—it may be called perfection. When Zhuang Zhou spoke of being “dependent on something,” was he not referring to the very threshold by which one enters?

Liezi asked Guan Yin: “The perfected person moves in concealment without emptiness.” “Without emptiness” means possessing substance. The perfected person’s actions and stillness do not treat this substance as an obstacle. Guo Xiang said: “Their heart is empty, thus they can master all things substantial.”

They tread fire without feeling heat, walk above the myriad things without trembling. Xiang Xiu said: “The world delights in exalting them without tiring—it is not their own self-aggrandizement, hence they do not tremble.”

Liezi asked: “How does one reach this state?”

Guan Yin replied: “It is the preservation of pure qi, not the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness. Utterly pure and utterly true, this is one’s inherent nature, not sought from without. Guard it carefully without loss, and nothing can harm you—how could mere cleverness, calculation, or courage enable one to endure hardship and peril?”

Lu said: “The perfected person moves in concealment, accumulating virtue not as a foundation, but as emptiness. How can they tread fire without heat or ascend heights without trembling? This shows that pure qi arises from nature; preserving spirit to unite with the Dao enables such attainment—hence they are called perfected. How could cunning, skill, or boldness achieve this?”

Ji, the fish speaks to you. (Note: “Fish” should read “I.”) All things with form, sound, or appearance are merely objects. From the sage above to the insects below, all are beings of form and sound. Observing one another through form and sound, there is no absolute distinction. How can one object be distant from another?

Xiang Xiu said: “Only the heartless stand apart.”

What suffices to surpass others? Merely form. Xiang Xiu said: “All are beings of form and color—nothing suffices to surpass another. What surpasses is only spontaneity.”

Lu said: “All that has form is an object; all objects are equal—how can form be later or earlier? Those who arbitrarily rank things are deeply deluded. Only by forgetting form, preserving spirit, and cultivating stillness to generate wisdom can one communicate with the divine. Then one reaches the formless and rests where there is no transformation.

If existence has no beginning, then what is created is formless; if form has no end, then where it rests is without transformation.” *Zao* is pronounced like *zuo*.

Those who grasp this and exhaust it—how could they not be correct? To trace form and sound in pursuit of their beginning and end—how could one reach the ultimate? Lu said: “Forgetting form and preserving spirit, one reaches the formless. Treasuring truth and uniting with the Dao, one rests where there is no transformation. If one attains this Dao and exhausts principle to fulfill nature, how could one not be correct?”

They dwell in a measure not excessive, observing form and color without seeking their beginning or end, thus not losing the correctness of spontaneity. *Shen* should read *yin*. And they conceal themselves in the boundless thread, for where is the ultimate principle hidden? Acting without attachment, they are obscure and traceless, with no visible edges or limits.

Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things, those who ride principle without intention always journey alongside them—how could they not progress through beginning and end? Lu said: “The perfected person does not lose virtue, hence does not exceed their measure. Their conduct does not lose the path, hence they conceal themselves without bounds. Always returning to their root, they roam the beginning and end of the myriad things.”

Unifying their nature, nurturing their qi, containing their virtue, they communicate with what things create. Those whose qi is unified and virtue pure—how could they merely communicate with themselves? Where things reach, they remove all obstacles, then universally aid living beings. *Zao* is pronounced like *cao*.

Lu said: “Nature untainted and true unites with heaven and earth in virtue, communicating with the nature and destiny of the myriad things. Those like this preserve heaven completely, their spirit unobstructed—how could things enter? When the natural endowment is unharmed, form and spirit are whole and one—how could sorrow or misfortune enter?”

Lu said: “Treasuring the Dao preserves nature; eliminating emotion leaves no gaps, no traces. How could external things enter?”

Fan said: “The harmony of balanced qi is what all receive in common. When one engages with things and forgets to return, they may falter. Only the preservation of pure qi, single-minded and unadulterated, harmonious and without violence, attains utmost emptiness—how could cunning, skill, or boldness compare?

Why? Form, sound, and appearance—no thing is different. Thus, one thing is fundamentally no more distant from another.”

How could such things reach completion? They begin with their allure—mere appearance. Thus, the completion of things lies beyond form, not in being formed by form; it rests where nothing transforms, not in being transformed by transformation. If one attains this and exhausts it, how could external things find a place to halt?

They dwell within the measure of no excess, never transgressing. They conceal themselves in the boundless thread, never exhausting. Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things, they move with the Maker of Things yet do not act. In this way, they guard the spirit by withdrawing into seclusion, retreating into the hidden—how could things find a way in?

Thus, they move in concealment without obstruction, for solidity cannot hinder them; they tread upon fire without burning, for flame cannot scorch them; they walk above the myriad things without trembling, for height cannot endanger them. When a drunkard falls from a cart, though the speed be great, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He does not know he is riding, nor does he know he has fallen.

This uses the coarse to illustrate the necessity of the utmost principle. Life and death, alarm and fear do not enter his breast; thus, he clashes with things yet does not break.

Xiang Xiu said: “He encounters them without terror.”
Though he is preserved by wine, it is still so—
Xiang Xiu said: “Drunkenness causes him to lose what he knows, not that he is naturally without mind.”
How much more so when one is preserved by Heaven?
Xiang Xiu said: “One wholly preserved by Heaven is naturally without mind, yielding and following the utmost principle.”
The sage conceals himself in Heaven, so nothing can harm him.
Guo Xiang said: “Not peering beyond the bounds of one’s nature and destiny—this is called concealment.”

Lu said: “The drunkard’s spirit is not united with the Dao. Yet because he is wholly preserved by wine, fear and dread do not enter his celestial storehouse; life and death do not harm his form and spirit. If one is wholly preserved in spirit, then things cannot harm him.”

*Zhenghe* states: The perfected person is divine. “Purity” means not impairing one’s spirit. The Way of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit. Guard it without loss, and become one with the spirit. Thus it is said: The perfected person moves in concealment without obstruction, treads upon fire without burning, walks above the myriad things without trembling. This is the preservation of pure qi, not the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness.

Form, appearance, sound, and color—all have names and realities. Once names and realities exist, they cling to stillness and movement. Once they receive their completion, form does not perish until it is exhausted—how then could they be distant from one another? How could they alone reach what precedes them?

The Dao as a thing completes what is formless, yet does not pair with things; it rests where nothing transforms, thus standing alone and not being moved by things. If form, color, name, and sound are truly insufficient to grasp its essence, then those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be considered correct?

The perfected person in this regard dwells within the measure of no excess, thus acting appropriately without transgression; conceals himself in the boundless thread, thus moving without exhaustion; advances through the beginning and end of the myriad things, thus roaming with the Maker of Things. Unifying his nature without duality, nurturing his qi without depletion, containing his virtue without dispersion, he connects with what is called “completing the formless” and “resting where nothing transforms.” His heavenly endowment remains whole, his spirit without gaps—how could things find a way in? This is why he moves in concealment without obstruction, treads upon fire without burning, walks above the myriad things without trembling.

The drunkard riding in the cart is preserved by wine, thus able to resist things without breaking. The perfected person walks above the myriad things, concealed in Heaven, thus able to overcome things without being harmed—both preserve pure qi and do not impair their spirit.

Fan said: Tracing form to its beginning, Heaven and Earth are born with me; tracing numbers to their origin, the myriad things are one with me. What thing can be called a cart? What thing can be called a person? What thing can be called a fall? What thing can be called harm? Once Heaven opens and humans engage in construction, they grasp things as real—what they see is truly a cart. Recognizing the self as substantial, what they know is truly a fall. Once knowledge and perception are established, riding and falling are distinguished—how could there be no harm?

Yet the drunkard wholly preserved by wine has his knowledge extinguished, his perception darkened. Riding, he does not know there is a cart; falling, he does not know there is the ground. Life and death, alarm and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he clashes with things yet is not daunted. Even one who temporarily entrusts his wholeness to wine is like this—how much more so for one whose nature remains whole, never having departed?

The world is but a single cart. Those who rely upon it and ride atop it open the camp of knowledge and perception, which pursues the disturbance of illusory change. Once disturbed, it will topple into the realm of delusions—not merely harm to bones and joints. The sage conceals himself in Heaven, so nothing can harm him—this is what was meant earlier by “guarding wholeness without gaps.”

Yet to call it Heaven is to oppose it to humanity—if nature is one, how can there be Heaven? To call it concealment is to oppose it to openness—if Heaven is one, how can there be concealment? Examining what completes this, there are indeed things that words cannot discuss.

Lie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest, the arrowhead reaching the very end. He placed a cup of water on his elbow, his hand steady and firm—the water did not spill. He loosed the arrow, and the arrowhead vanished into the distance.
Guo Xiang said: The arrow departs, the arrowhead gone, then returns in obscurity.
As the arrow was still lodged, another was already in place.
Guo Xiang said: The arrow has just departed, not yet reaching the target, yet another is already placed on the elbow—speaking of the marvel of swiftness.

At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.
Lu said: Drawing the bow to fullness, placing water on his elbow, loosing one arrow while another remains—like a wooden figure.

Will resolute, spirit settled, form unmoving—thus he attained this.

Bohun Wuren said: This is the shooting of one who shoots. Though it exhausts the principles of shooting, it cannot but rely on pride in the thing. It is not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Forgetting whether one can or cannot, though not shooting, one is equal to shooting. Now, let us ascend a high mountain, tread on perilous stones, stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then? If within there is fear, you will lose your shooting.

Lu said: Relying on one’s skill and resting in one’s form, one examines only what is fitting. This is not to speak of forgetting form and leaving things behind, moving by spirit alone.

Thereupon Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod on perilous stones, stood at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss. His back receded, two parts of his feet hung over the edge. He bowed to Yu Kou and beckoned him forward. Yu Kou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Lu said: To ascend heights and tread peril, yet fear as he did—this is to worry for one’s body, to cherish one’s life. Little does he know that he who is aware of his form only harms his life, while he who forgets his form is precisely the one who preserves it. Yu Kou is merely skilled in shooting, not one who accords with the Dao. Only he who forgets form and perfects spirit, unburdened by all under heaven, attains the shooting of one who does not shoot.

Bohun Wuren said: The perfected person gazes upward into the blue sky, plunges downward into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits—his spirit and qi remain unchanged.

Guo Xiang said: To *hui chi* is to let go freely. When virtue fills within, spirit overflows without. No matter how distant, deep, or obscure, wherever one is, all is clear. Thus one discerns the pivot of safety and danger yet remains serene and self-possessed.

Now you are flushed with the ambition to follow the eye—within, you are already imperiled.

Guo Xiang said: Unable to grasp the ultimate distinction, you are beset by fear and lose much—how could this be limited to shooting?

Lu said: The person of utmost Dao is self-content between heaven and earth, spirit and qi sovereign alone. Sorrow and joy cannot enter. Now you still tremble with fear like this—how could you be near the Dao? In this, you have merely begun your first practice; you have not yet attained its marvel.

**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**
To draw the bow to full draw speaks of its power; to place a cup of water upon the elbow speaks of its precision. When loosed, the arrowhead and shaft follow in seamless succession—while the first arrow is still in flight, the next already rests upon the string. This describes one who, like a wooden figurine, remains unmoving, for their intent is utterly undivided. Yet this is still but a skill that has not yet penetrated the Dao. Thus it is called *the archery of archery*, not *the archery beyond archery*.

The perfected person gazes upward into the azure heavens—how could this be merely the height of climbing a mountain? They plunge downward into the Yellow Springs—how could this be merely the depth of standing at an abyss? They cast their spirit to the eight directions, their qi and spirit unchanging—how could this be merely turning their back in hesitation, with two parts of the foot still hanging over the edge?

When Liezi prostrated himself upon the ground, drenched in sweat, unable to shoot, it showed that though he guarded his purity without flaw, his spirit had not yet attained its utmost. Thus it is said: *Now you are imperiled within.*

**Fan’s Commentary:**
To draw the bow to full draw is the perfection of holding fullness; to place a cup of water upon the elbow is the perfection of levelness and straightness. When loosed, the arrowhead and shaft follow in seamless succession—this means the first arrow has just been released when the next already overlaps. The next arrow rests upon the string—this means the following arrow is already nocked while the first is still in flight. At such a moment, one resembles a wooden figurine, their intent undivided, just as the saying goes: *gazing upon them, they seem like a wooden rooster.* Such is the archery of archery, and nothing more.

As for the archery beyond archery, it is not merely standing upon a high mountain, treading upon perilous stones, or facing an abyss of a hundred fathoms—though the danger has reached its extreme, one’s heart remains unmoved, and every shot finds its mark. This is why it is called *the archery beyond archery.*

Extending this further, the perfected person gazes upward into the azure heavens and thereby exhausts its height; they plunge downward into the Yellow Springs and thereby fathom its depth. They cast their spirit to the eight directions, their qi and spirit unchanging—this is the utmost greatness and utmost firmness, filling the space between heaven and earth. Who among such as these would still tremble with the intent to follow the eye?

*The Four Commentaries on the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue and Emptiness, Scroll the Fourth—Concluded*
*The Four Commentaries on the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue and Emptiness, Scroll the Fifth*

Emperor Huang’s minister, the Fan clan, had a son named Zihua, who excelled at cultivating his private reputation and was a leader among the wandering knights. The entire state deferred to him; though favored by the Lord of Jin, he held no office yet ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at askance, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke of slightingly, the state of Jin demoted—*fei* meaning "to slight." Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the courtiers in number. Zihua had his knights attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, overpower the weak with strength, and though they suffered wounds before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, until the state nearly became a custom.

Lu comments: *"Pian shi"* means an intense sidelong glance; *"pian fei"* means thick slander. The knights took his words as the measure of honor and disgrace, so those who frequented his gate were comparable to the court of Jin. Zihua allowed his retainers to indulge in unrestrained debate, sparing nothing, until mutual slander and humiliation became the prevailing custom.

Hesheng and Zibo, the Fan clan’s foremost retainers, went on a journey and passed beyond the outer fields—*shang* meaning the outskirts beyond the suburbs. They lodged at the hut of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai (Geng should read *Yu*). In the dead of night, Hesheng and Zibo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish, the dead live, the rich poor, and the poor rich.

Lu comments: To make the living perish is to slander them; to make the dead live is to praise them; to make the rich poor is to seize from them; to make the poor rich is to bestow upon them.

Shangqiu Kai, a man of lowly origins and no understanding, took their words to be the work of sagely power. He had long suffered from cold and hunger and had been eavesdropping by the north window. Thereupon, he borrowed provisions and a basket and went to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s retainers were all from eminent families, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, pacing slowly with haughty gazes. When they saw Shangqiu Kai—old, feeble, with a swarthy face, his clothes and cap in disarray—they all sneered at him (*nie*, pronounced *nu ge*). Soon they grew familiar, insulting and deceiving him, shoving and striking, pushing and dragging—nothing was left undone. Shangqiu Kai never showed anger, and the knights’ tricks were meager, exhausted by their mockery.

Lu comments: *"Fu nong"* means the height of frivolous play; *"xia wu"* means treating him with undue familiarity; *"qi dai"* means acting with reckless presumption; *"dang"* means jostling him; *"bi"* means twisting his limbs; *"ai"* means subjecting him to shame; *"du"* means resisting and repelling him.

Then they went with Shangqiu Kai to a high terrace and, before the crowd, casually declared: "Whoever can leap down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces." All clamored to accept.

Lu comments: These were fools mocking him, so they feigned eagerness to comply.

Shangqiu Kai took them at their word and leapt first, his body like a flying bird, alighting on the ground—his bones unbroken, his flesh unharmed. The Fan clan’s faction thought it a fluke and did not yet find it strange. Then they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: "There is a treasure pearl in that spot; you can retrieve it by swimming." Shangqiu Kai again dove in and swam beneath the water (*yong* meaning to move submerged). When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to share their doubt. (*Fang* means "to begin.")

Then Master Hua of Fang ordered that Shangqiu Kai be provided with meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Master Hua said: "Whoever can enter the flames and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring out." Shangqiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the fire unscathed—no soot clung to him, nor was his body singed. The Fan clan’s faction, believing him to possess the Dao, jointly apologized: "We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you—*dan* meaning 'to deceive.' We did not know you were a divine being and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, or blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?"

Lu comments: Leaping from the terrace as though flying, retrieving the pearl from the water as though on land, entering and exiting fire without harm—Master Hua’s disciples all took him for a divine being possessing the Dao. Yet this man, though deceived and angered, showed no resentment. Surely he must have thought us deaf and blind, yet he still deigned to ask of his Dao.

Shangqiu Kai replied: "I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I know not how this comes to be. Nevertheless, there is one thing I can tell you. When your two guests lodged at my home, I heard them praise the Fan clan’s power—how they could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them without doubt and thus came without delay. Upon arriving, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my sincerity was insufficient, that my actions fell short. I knew not where to place my body or where harm and benefit lay. My heart was unified, and things offered no resistance—thus it was. Now that I know your faction deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display caution without. I recall with relief how I was not scorched or drowned, yet my heart trembles with dread. How could I again approach water or fire?"

Lu comments: The *Daodejing* says, "Great wisdom appears foolish"—this resembles but does not fully capture it. Only one whose will is single, without other concerns, and who can suddenly forget their own form may remain untouched by life and death, fear and dread. How much more so for one who merges indistinguishably with the Dao, treasures their spirit to unite with the real, whose wisdom pervades the cosmos, and whose power suffices for all things—how could such feats be merely a matter of one or two? Yet when right and wrong arise in the heart, even water and fire become unapproachable.

Thereafter, when the Fan clan’s disciples encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and reported it to Confucius. Confucius said: "Did you not know? A person of perfect sincerity can move things. They can stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could this be limited to treading perilous heights or entering water and fire? If Shangqiu Kai’s belief in false things did not meet with resistance, how much more so when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples."

Lu comments: Beggars and horse-doctors are lowly people; even fools dare slight them. Yet the Master spoke of the power of perfect sincerity—his reasoning is exhaustive.

*Zhenghe* states: Sincerity gives rise to spirit, and one whose spirit is whole follows the Dao of the sage, embracing spirit in their wanderings. Amid the vulgar world, they remain vast and perfectly unadorned, forgetting schemes, profit, and cunning. In such a person’s heart, life and death, shock and fear cannot enter. Thus, they defy things without fear and walk above the myriad things without trembling. When others deceive them, they respond with sincerity—where could they not go? Thus, Shangqiu Kai leapt from the high terrace, his bones unbroken; he swam to the river’s bend and emerged with the pearl; he entered and exited the fire without soot clinging to him. That he was not scorched was due to sincerity. For the Dao of perfect sincerity enters and unites with spirit, unaware of where to place the body or where harm and benefit lie—thus it can overcome things without injury. Hence, the drunken man who falls from a carriage suffers no harm, and the Yellow Emperor lost his dark pearl only to have Xiangwang retrieve it. As for treading fire without feeling heat, Guan Yin surely deemed it the preservation of pure *qi*. But if cunning resides in the heart, purity is incomplete. When purity is incomplete, the spirit is unsettled, and the Dao cannot bear it. Thus, when Shangqiu Kai realized the deception, recalling with relief his past escapes from scorching and drowning, he trembled with dread—water and fire became unapproachable because cunning arose and doubt took hold. The distance between believing in false things with sincerity and doubting with suspicion is thus vast. Yet the person of perfect sincerity surpasses even this. They can stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could this be limited to treading perilous heights or entering water and fire?

Fan says: Those who wield fame and power to intimidate others can never truly subdue them. But those who embody sincerity in their dealings with things find ease in every encounter. Shangqiu Kai could be said to have embodied sincerity. Thus, hearing praise of the Fan clan, he believed it without doubt; enduring the crowd’s insults, he showed no resentment; leaping from the high terrace, he suffered no injury; retrieving the pearl from the river’s bend, he did not drown; taking the brocade from the fire, he was not scorched. Tracing the reason for this, sincerity resided in his heart, and things offered no resistance—thus it was. If his sincerity could not be harmed by others’ deceit, how much more so for a person of perfect sincerity? Stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without resistance—this is no wonder.

King Xuan of Zhou had a herdsman named Liang Yang who could raise wild birds and beasts. He scattered food in the gardens, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and owls became gentle. Male and female gathered before him, breeding in groups. Different species lived together without attacking or biting. The king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it.

Liang Yang said: "I, Yang, am but a lowly servant—what art could I possibly teach you? I fear my lord suspects me of concealing something, so let me speak of my method for raising tigers.

All creatures with blood and qi rejoice when obeyed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. Yet their joy and anger are not wantonly aroused; both arise from opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not offer it living prey, for it would kill in fury; one fears provoking its rage through slaughter. Nor should one give it whole prey, for it would tear it apart in fury; one fears inciting its rage through exertion. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand the source of its anger."

Xiang Xiu said: "This means avoiding what angers its heart and complying with its nature."

Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, they fawn upon those who raise them—this is compliance. Creatures of disparate natures lovingly fawn upon me because I comply with them. Thus, to kill is to oppose; harming creatures opposes their hearts. How then could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet neither do I comply to make them rejoice. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger inevitably turns to joy—both miss the mean. When extremes are reached, they reverse; this is the inevitable pattern.

Now, my heart holds neither opposition nor compliance, so birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my gardens do not long for towering forests or vast marshes; those that rest in my courtyards do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work. The sage’s way of nurturing all living things, allowing each to fulfill its nature, is like a servant’s ability to tend birds and beasts so they do not harm one another."

Lu said: "Though forms and substances differ, spirit and qi are not distinct. Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: 'Seeing their differences, the liver and gallbladder seem as distant as Chu and Yue. Seeing their sameness, the myriad things are one body.' The perfected person unites them through spirit. Birds do not stray in flight, beasts do not scatter in herds—this is because their wills align without opposition. Thus, fierce beasts may be tamed, and sea gulls may be befriended.

Birds and beasts retreat to deep mountains and secluded valleys to preserve themselves and escape human harm. Yet if no threat exists, what difference is there between gardens and forests?"

*Zhenghe* states: "The softest in the world gallops through the hardest—this is the sage’s great path to victory. Tigers and wolves are the fiercest of beasts; eagles and owls, the most rapacious of birds. Yet different kinds dwell together without attacking or biting, content within the gardens—this is because the method of harmonizing and taming them is rooted in principle.

The nature of life and destiny finds peace in compliance. Excessive joy or anger disrupts the balance of yin and yang. To provoke anger is not to comply with the nature of life and destiny. Thus, one who raises tigers times their hunger and satiety, understands the source of their anger—all to comply with their nature.

How could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? This means not violating their nature. Nor do I comply to make them rejoice, for that would indulge their nature. Joy inevitably turns to anger, anger inevitably turns to joy—both are excesses of the Way. Now, my heart holds neither opposition nor compliance: I neither violate their nature to anger them nor indulge their nature to please them. Thus, their contentment and ease are fitting.

The sage’s way of nurturing life does not allow likes and dislikes to internally harm the body. Extending this to nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world—what other method is there but this?"

Fan said: "Creatures with blood and qi cannot be without joy and anger. Thus, though birds and beasts differ from humans, their joy and anger always arise from human opposition or compliance. One who skillfully raises tigers does not dare oppose them to provoke anger, nor does he comply to make them rejoice. Thus, birds and beasts of different kinds regard him as one of their own.

Yet when applied to human affairs, the decline of the human Way is often worse than raising tigers. Only the sage interacts with things without harming them, so things cannot harm him. *Zhuangzi*’s parables, such as the 'Human World' chapter, also speak of raising tigers—this is the principle it clarifies."

Yan Hui asked Confucius: "I once crossed the deep abyss of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat?' He said, 'Yes. Those who can swim may be taught; skilled swimmers quickly master it.'"

Xiang Xiu said: "Their skill comes naturally—speaking of their method, they must be unafraid of boats."

"As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet rise to handle it."

*Su* (起) is pronounced *su* (所六切), meaning "to rise."

Xiang Xiu said: "This refers to those who excel at diving."

*Wu* (骛) is pronounced *mu* (音木).

"I asked him, but he did not answer. May I ask what this means?"

Lu said: "Those skilled at handling boats can learn it. Those adept at swimming have practiced it repeatedly. As for divers, though they have never seen a boat, they rise to handle it—this is a spiritual communion they cannot defy."

*Zhenghe* annotates: "Handling a boat as if by magic means the Dao aids the world in ways beyond comprehension. 'Those who can swim may be taught' refers to their not being drowned by things. 'Skilled swimmers quickly master it' means they have long abided in the Way. As for divers, who have never seen a boat yet rise to handle it—this is wondrous and unknowable. Asking yet receiving no answer means the Dao has reached a point where it cannot be explained to others."

Confucius said: "Ah! You and I have long pondered its words, yet failed to grasp its essence—still, I shall now speak of it. *Ah* is pronounced *yi*. Seeing that handling a boat can be learned is merely pondering its words; not comprehending that divers act by nature is failing to reach its truth. Now I shall explain it to you.

'Those who can swim may be taught'—they treat water lightly. 'Skilled swimmers quickly master it'—they forget the water. Forgetting water means having no fear or caution. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet rise to handle it, they see abysses as hills and a capsized boat as a cart rolling back. Though ten thousand things lie before them, none enter their dwelling—for the spirit resides there. Where could they not find leisure? All they encounter is ease.

One who casts with tiles is skillful; with hooks, hesitant; with gold, confused. *Kou* means to cast with varying objects. Guo Xiang said: The heavier the stake, the more the mind clings. Lu said: Seeing that handling a boat can be learned is merely pondering its words. One who grasps its truth sees water as land, capsizing and drowning do not enter his spirit—where could he not find leisure?

One who casts with tiles sees only skill, hitting the mark without fear of losing the tile. With hooks, he is no longer focused on skill but fears clumsiness in losing the hook. With gold, he dares not hope to hit the mark, only dreads the loss of gold. Thus, past mastery lay in forgetting external things; present fear lies in cherishing them. People know the dual failings of clinging to externals yet covet things to their own ruin.

Skill is one, yet when one clings, externals grow heavy. All who prize externals neglect the internal. Only by forgetting both inner and outer, discarding light and heavy, does one transcend skill and clumsiness."

*Zhenghe* annotates: "*Ah* is the same as *yi*. It is like medicine—intent. Calling it *ah* may imply correcting one’s errors. 'Those who can swim may be taught'—they treat water lightly, so drowning does not burden their form. 'Skilled swimmers quickly master it'—they forget water, so treading its ways brings no change to themselves. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet rise to handle it, they unite self and world, doubting nothing in their actions. Life and death, fear and dread do not enter their breast—how much less the seeds of profit and harm?

This is why they see abysses as hills, a capsized boat as a cart rolling back. Though ten thousand things lie before them, none enter their dwelling—nowhere do they not find leisure. One whose inner resources in the Dao are shallow is easily swayed by external things. Thus, casting with tiles is skillful; with hooks, hesitant; with gold, confused.

Earlier scholars said *kou* means to cast with varying objects, referring to drawing lots or casting hooks. The heavier the stake, the more the mind clings. Thus, with tiles one is skillful; with hooks, hesitant; with gold, confused. Hesitation fears loss alone; confusion is as if lost. Hence, 'those who prize externals neglect the internal.' Neglecting the internal means the heart is bound and cannot rest.

Fan said: "The ancients who rode the Dao and virtue to roam freely emptied themselves of burdens, hollowed their hearts of things. They guarded the spirit, letting nothing enter—where could they not find leisure? Once one clings, how can there be no inner clumsiness?"

Confucius observed at Lüliang. The waterfall plunged thirty *ren*, its rapids surged thirty *li*, where turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and thought him in distress, wishing to die. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, loosened his hair, and sang as he walked beneath the embankment.

Confucius followed and asked him: "The waterfall at Lüliang plunges thirty *ren*, its rapids surge thirty *li*—where turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. Just now I saw you tread it and thought you in distress, wishing to die, so I sent my disciples along the current to save you. You emerged, loosened your hair, and sang—I took you for a ghost! Examining you, I see you are a man. May I ask if treading water has a method?"

The man said: "No. I have no method. I begin with what is innate, grow with my nature, and complete it with fate. I enter with the swirl and emerge with the surge. *Ji* and *gu* describe water swirling in and surging out. I follow the water’s way without imposing my will—this is how I tread it."

Confucius said: "What do you mean by beginning with what is innate, growing with nature, and completing it with fate?"

The man said: "I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is innate. *Innate* is like plainness; abiding in true plainness, one finds ease in all encounters. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is nature. Following nature’s principles, nothing opposes it. Not knowing why I am so yet being so—this is fate. The principle of spontaneity cannot be known by wisdom; knowing it cannot be known is called fate."

Lu said: "To be born on the hills and find ease in their use, to be born in water and find ease in water—habit becomes constancy. Thus it is said: beginning with what is innate, growing with nature. By habituating to what is innate, one settles into nature; suddenly, the spirit converges to complete fate, gaining it without self-awareness.

Therefore, the *Yi* says: 'Exhaust the principles, fulfill nature, to reach fate.' Fate is the契合 of the spirit-Way. *Zhenghe* states: Where the soft-shelled turtle and fish cannot swim, he swims—thus forgetting the peril of fording. Taking you for a ghost, yet observing you, you are but a man—yet one suspects the numinous. Yet seeking his Way, it is simply following the water’s way without imposing his will.

Those who sink with the *ji* plumb the depths; those who rise with the *gu* skim the heights—all is left to spontaneity. This is what is meant by 'following the water’s way without imposing one’s will.'

Born on the hills and at ease on the hills, he does not lose what is thus; grown in water and at ease in water, he does not oppose what is natural. The spontaneous is not burdened by externals, nor altered within; that by which it is so cannot be known—thus it is said: 'Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so—this is fate.'

Fan said: What is caused by something is innate; what is spontaneous without cause is nature; not knowing why it is so, yet it is so—this is fate.

The Lord of Lüliang sinks with the *ji* and rises with the *gu*, following the water’s way without imposing his will—thus he treads where the soft-shelled turtle and fish cannot swim. Is this due to some partial ability? Then the one who embodies the Way is indeed nowhere unsuited."

Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback catching cicadas as easily as if he were plucking them up. Confucius said: "You are skillful! Is there a method to this?" The man replied: "I have a method. After five or six months of practice, if I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I lose only a fraction; as Xiang Xiu notes: 'If one stacks eighteen and they do not fall, it is due to the steadiness of the hand—thus in catching cicadas, what is lost is no more than a hair’s breadth.' If I stack three and they do not fall, I lose one in ten. If I stack five and they do not fall, I catch them as easily as plucking them. When the hand is perfectly steady, nothing is lost. My stance is like a stump or a broken tree—Cui Zhuan says: 'A stump or broken tree.'—and my arm is as still as a withered branch. Though the world is vast and things are many, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?"

Guo Xiang says: "Abandoning the other, one attains this." Lu says: "At first, when learning to stack pellets, one never succeeds. After half a year of practice, one can stack two without them falling. With unceasing practice, one reaches the point of stacking five without them falling—why is this? My body is like a stump, my arm like a withered branch, my mind fixed and unwavering, free from stray thoughts. Though things are many, my awareness rests solely on the cicada—how could I fail?"

Confucius turned to his disciples and said: "When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit. 'Divided' means scattered; when intent is focused, it resembles the spirit." This is what the hunchbacked elder meant. Lu says: "With wholehearted focus, one congeals into spirit. The Master saw that the elder had not forgotten the cicada’s wings, thus he congealed into spirit—not that he had attained spiritual communion."

The elder said: "You are one of those in flowing robes—what do you know of such matters? Cultivate your own way, and only then may you speak of it." "Cultivate" means to refine. Refine the arts of benevolence and righteousness you employ, return to the natural Way, and only then may you embody these words. Lu says: "The Master’s disciples are all scholars in flowing robes, using benevolence and righteousness to teach the world, causing it to clamor after fame and profit, exhausting its wit and care, losing its true nature, and straining its spirit—what do they know of this Way? You who leave writings for later generations now wish to use the eloquence of your words to record this Way in writing."

*Zhenghe* says: "Will is the essence of single-minded focus. One who is precise in the Way is nowhere unsuited. His stance is like a stump, his arm like a withered branch—motionless and forgetting his own form. Though the world is vast and things are many, he knows only the cicada’s wings. Without turning or swaying, without letting the myriad things distract him from the cicada’s wings, his sincerity is unshaken, and external disturbances vanish. The longer his focus, the fewer his losses. Thus, at first, he loses only a fraction; with time, one in ten; and later, he plucks them as easily as if they were his own. There is no other reason—his will is single-minded. Single-minded will is called essence. Only the most refined essence in the world can penetrate, only the most divine spirit. Thus it is said: 'When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit.'"

Fan says: "Catching cicadas is a minor skill. When the will is undivided, one attains the wonder of congealed spirit. Thus, what was earlier called the guarding of pure *qi*—its undivided will is now clear."

There was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the shore and followed the gulls, and hundreds of them would come without fail. When the heart is harmonious and the form compliant, creatures do not shun it. "Without fail" should read "in great numbers." His father said: "I hear the gulls all follow you—bring some back for me to play with." The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not land. When the heart stirs within, the form changes without, and even birds sense it—how much less can human principles be feigned? Thus it is said: "The highest words transcend words; the highest action is non-action. What the wisdom of the world knows is shallow indeed." When words are utterly forgotten, things harbor no doubt. To be limited by what wisdom knows is to miss the mark by far.

Some doubt whether the elder feigned his form to catch cicadas or whether the boy’s harmonious heart allowed the gulls to approach—these two cases seem opposed, yet the boy did not offend the creatures. The foundation of these teachings differs, but though they appear contradictory, they converge in the same truth. The elder demonstrated that even with focused thought, one can avoid startling creatures—how much more so when one attains the profound, when one’s form is like wood or stone? As for the boy, his sincere heart filled his inner being, and his outward demeanor was open and unguarded. Though he had not yet forgotten both benefit and harm or dissolved all suspicion, he was at ease among different creatures, unperturbed by their strangeness. These two parables use the near to illustrate the distant, the minor to clarify the fundamental.

Lu says: "Spiritual communion can be understood through principle, not through emotion. When emotion arises, even flesh and blood suspect one another; when principle arises, all things are without barrier—only then can one discern the subtle and profound. To be one with the myriad things lies in spiritual communion; to be one with living beings lies in the extinction of emotion. To pride oneself on one’s mind and wit is to be far from the Way."

*Zhenghe* says: "The ancients who possessed the Way abandoned cunning and forgot schemes, their inner purity complete. Thus, they could enter the midst of beasts without disturbing the herd or join flocks of birds without disrupting their flight. Birds and beasts did not shun them—how much less humans? For their inner being was empty of intent, and creatures naturally trusted them. When inner purity is incomplete, schemes and stratagems multiply, and thus birds take flight to avoid the harm of nets and arrows. The gulls danced above but would not land because the boy had once abandoned cunning but now relied on it."

The sage does not govern the state through cunning. When he speaks, there is no burden of speech; when he acts, there are no traces of action. To equalize all that wisdom knows is but shallow.

Fan says: The *ou* is a seabird, emerging and submerging like bubbles. When scheming resides in the breast, even the seabirds on the sea merely dance above and do not descend—how much less humans? The sage who engages the world utters ultimate words yet leaves no words; though he speaks, he has never spoken. He performs ultimate non-action; though he acts, he has never acted. Suspicion and doubt do not arise, and his inner purity is fully realized. Entering flocks of birds, he does not disrupt their flight—who would dance above and not descend? But once one equalizes all that wisdom knows, speech may err and action may falter, and one has not yet escaped the burden—how could one deeply penetrate the Way?

Viscount Zhao of Zhao led a retinue of a hundred thousand to hunt in Mount Zhong, calling the great hunt a "royal chase." They set fire to the forests, fanning flames that scorched a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghostly being. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched by what he had traversed. Viscount Zhao, astonished, detained him and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were those of a man; his breath and voice were those of a man. He asked, "By what way did you dwell in the stone? By what way did you enter the fire?" The man replied, "What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?" He was utterly unaware of stone or fire—what thing could obstruct him? Viscount Zhao said, "What you emerged from just now was stone; what you traversed just now was fire." The man said, "I do not know." Only through the extremity of not-knowing could he attain this.

Duke Wen of Wei, having heard of this, asked Zixia, "What manner of man is he?" Zixia replied, "From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who harmonizes achieves great unity with all things—nothing can injure or obstruct him. To wander through metal and stone, to tread upon water and fire, all are possible."

Duke Wen said, "Why do you not practice this yourself?" Zixia answered, "To hollow out the heart and cast off knowledge—this I have not yet been able to do. Nevertheless, let me attempt to speak of it when there is leisure. For if one relies on the heart to hollow out the heart, borrows knowledge to discard knowledge, the burdens of heart and knowledge may indeed be exhausted—but the traces of what has been cast off still remain. To realize that the ultimate principle cannot be grasped by the exertions of the heart—this, in speech, is a matter of surplus leisure."

Lu said: The previous chapter spoke of wandering through water without obstruction; this chapter clarifies how fire and stone do no harm. Most men are accustomed to water, but few tread upon fire—lest the common mind cling to partiality, this further discourse on fire serves to elucidate. Within, he forgets his own form; without, he forgets all things. He does not know how stone obstructs or how fire injures.

Duke Wen, not understanding, raised the question. Zixia, having long known the matter, answered well. Thus the Duke pressed further: "Since you are one who knows, why do you not practice it?" Zixia replied, "To know and speak of it is already surplus for me. As for embodying and realizing it—this I have not yet been able to do."

Duke Wen asked, "Why does the Master not practice it?" Zixia said, "The Master is capable of it but does not act upon it." Duke Wen was greatly pleased.

In the world, there are those capable of something yet able not to do it; those capable of something yet unable not to do it; those incapable yet who force themselves to do it; and those who do not act yet naturally possess the ability. As for the sage—what does he do? What does he not do? What is he capable of? What is he incapable of? He bows and rises with the common world, ascends and descends with all things. Extraordinary deeds and wondrous traces never briefly appear; the sublime subtlety within his being is not one in ten thousand to be seen.

From the beginning of this scroll to this chapter, it has expounded the Way of following one’s nature and destiny. One who is not entangled by the five emotions, who single-mindedly cultivates softness, and whose sincerity is without duality—such a one may dwell in water and fire without scorching or drowning, traverse wood and stone without hindrance, touch blades without injury, and tread perilous heights without falling. No thing in the world opposes his heart; entering the midst of beasts, he does not disturb their herds. His spirit roams alone; his body ascends lightly. His ears penetrate all sounds; his eyes illumine all things.

These words may seem unconventional, truly startling to the common mind. Let us then examine them:

Yin and yang alternate in transformation; the five agents pervade all nurturance. Metal and earth beget one another as mother and child; water and fire contend through dryness and moisture. Human nature diverges in stillness and agitation; ascent and descent differ in their capacities and dispositions. Thus there are winged creatures soaring through clouds, scaled ones lurking in the depths, fire-dwelling mice, and wood-concealing insects. Why? Hardness and softness, heat and cold—each has its proper place. To be confined to one realm is to be hindered in all others.

As for the perfected person, their mind merges mysteriously with primordial qi, their body harmonizes darkly with yin and yang. Neither square nor round conforms to a single form; neither warmth nor coolness is bound to a single vessel. With spirit settled and qi harmonized, all they traverse accords with the Way. Thus the five agents cannot oppose them, nor can cold or heat cause harm. This is called possessing profound virtue and perfect harmony. Hence they dwell perpetually beyond the realm of death—how could deliberate effort or withdrawal preserve them?

Treading water and fire, riding clouds and mist, scaling perilous heights, entering the midst of weapons—these are scarcely worth marveling at.

Lu [Huiqing] says: When the Master *could* act yet did not, it was to employ benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and the Way of ruler and minister to rescue a declining age—not merely to perfect himself among flocks of birds and beasts.

*Zhenghe* [commentary]: When the mind merges with the Dao, they become one, never yet divided. When form shifts with things, the myriad transformations never begin differently. Subject and object stand opposed, touching all things as dualities. Harmonized by Heaven’s spontaneity, why seek distinction? Self and other share a single root; "that" and "this" are one in essence. Without the contrast of emptiness and fullness, passing through stone walls—what could obstruct? Without the friction of benefit and harm, ascending and descending through smoke and embers—what could cause injury? Thus it is said: Harmony unites with things; nothing can harm one so aligned. Obstruction means wandering through metal and stone, treading water and fire—all becomes possible.

Zixia understood this yet could not attain it; the Master could attain it yet did not act. For the Dao is not something the intentional can grasp from afar, nor the unintentional draw near. Thus Zixia said: "Carve out the heart and cast off wisdom"—yet Shang could not achieve this.

The sage conceals himself in Heaven without self-display. That the Master *could* yet did not act was true indeed. Those who toil to wander through metal and stone, tread water and fire, believing themselves possessed of the Dao—such a path opposes the world, making it possible for others to emulate them.

Thus the *Liezi* surveys the teachings of all masters and exalts the Master as the great completion.

Fan [Zhen] says: Stone is solid and obstructive; fire is fierce and burns. One who touches solidity yet is not obstructed—though emerging from stone walls, they know not the stone. One who treads fire yet feels no heat—though moving through smoke and embers, they know not the fire. To enter this Way, one must harmonize and unite with things—only then can it be achieved. For great harmony transcends the human; all things are viewed as one. Wandering through metal and stone, treading water and fire—nowhere is impossible.

If one seeks to carve out the heart yet cannot empty it of things, or to cast off wisdom yet cannot unite with the great flow, then though the words may be flawless, the deed remains unattainable. That the Master *could* yet did not act—was this not because he attained it through the heart?

A divine shaman from Qi arrived in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, and day with godlike precision. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in avoidance.

Xiang Xiu says: No one delights in hearing their own death date.

Liezi met him and was utterly enchanted. Xiang Xiu says: He was deluded by his Way.

Returning, Liezi reported to Master Huqiu, saying: "At first, I took the Master’s Dao as the ultimate, yet now there is something even more ultimate."

Guo Xiang says: He meant that Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even the Master’s.

Master Hu said: "I have shown you only its outward form, not yet its true substance—how then could you have grasped the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs?"

Xiang Xiu says: True substance is revealed through outward form; the Dao is made manifest through affairs. To possess the Dao yet engage in no affairs is like having hens without a rooster. Though you and I differ in depth, we both abide in the realm of substance—thus no outward form arises to manifest it. Therefore, I have not yet fully revealed the true substance of my Dao. This speaks of how the sage’s song must await a responsive echo. To oppose the world with the Dao is to be truly steadfast—only then can others perceive and assess you."

Xiang Xiu says: Lacking a single method to be steadfast in the world, one becomes assessable.

Lu says: Liezi was captivated upon seeing the Zheng shaman, believing his knowledge of life and death, fortune and misfortune encompassed the entirety of the Dao. Master Huqiu replied: "You and I have merely glimpsed its traces, not yet its true principle—how could you have attained my Dao? To still the spirit and quiet the mind is like a flock of hens; to act and achieve success is like a rooster. You now rest in stillness—how can you seek eggs without a rooster? To pit the ultimate Dao against a vulgar shaman is to be so deeply convinced that even spirits perceive you."

From the *Zhenghe* commentary: The *Zhuangzi* states—
Fan says: The term "spirit" describes the wondrous workings of all things. Shamans, however, deceive with false claims of divine speech. Thus, predictions of life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death—though seemingly precise to the year, month, or day—appear wondrous but are not truly so; they are merely "spiritual." Though called a "spirit shaman," Ji Xian embodies the wondrous responsiveness of things. To be "Xian" is to be responsive; to respond is to have intent. To impose one’s own intent upon others’ minds, to project one’s own perceptions onto others’ visions—these eight terms (life, death, survival, demise, fortune, misfortune, longevity, early death) are but empty names. Once names arise as empty, one falsely perceives them; once perceived falsely, one speaks of them falsely. Those in the world who cling to appearances and cannot transcend delusion then falsely accept them as true—hence they flee in avoidance. Though Liezi was enchanted upon seeing him, he could not master his own mind, for his understanding of the Dao, even when taken to Master Huqiu, had not yet cut off learning. He had grasped only its outward form, not its true substance. The Dao has never possessed anything, yet nothing exists outside the Dao. Thus, emptiness and voidness have no equal—like a flock of hens without a rooster. To cling to it alone within one’s breast is like seeking eggs without a rooster. To oppose the world with the Dao yet insist on being believed is to fail to stand in the unfathomable and wander in nothingness—thus others can perceive and assess you. Come, bring him to me, that I may show myself to him."

The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Master Hu. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: "Alas! Your master is dead—he cannot live. He will not last ten days. I saw something strange in him—like damp ashes."

Liezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked the bedding, and told Master Hu. Master Hu said: "Just now, I showed him *Earth’s Pattern*."

Xiang Xiu says: Like a clod of earth.

"Motionless yet not inert."

The character *zui* (罪) may also be written as *meng* (萌).

Xiang Xiu says: Sprouting yet unmoving, neither acting nor ceasing—like a withered tree sharing its lack of bloom, like dead ashes sharing their lifeless stillness. This is the sage’s state of non-responsiveness. The sage’s movement is like Heaven; his stillness, like Earth; his conduct, like flowing water; his depth, like a silent abyss. The abyss’s silence and water’s flow, Heaven’s movement and Earth’s stillness—all are naturally one in non-action. Now, Ji Xian saw me dwelling as a corpse and sitting in forgetfulness, and so declared me near death. Yet when he saw my spirit move and Heaven follow, he took it as a sign of life. If one responds without intent, then one ascends and descends with change, measuring the world—only then can one master things and follow the timeless without limit. How could a diviner perceive this? He merely saw me *blocking the subtle stirrings of virtue*."

Xiang Xiu says: Virtue’s stirrings were unmanifest, hence "blocked."

Lu says: Spirits and gods perceive only the movements of the human heart. Where there is attachment, spirits know it. Master Hu’s countenance remained like damp ashes; his mind clung to the soil, sprouting yet without thought—hence *Heaven’s Pattern*. To stir is to live; to be still is to be profoundly quiescent—hence "neither moving nor inert."

From the *Zhenghe* commentary: To see something strange is to perceive the extraordinary; damp ashes cannot be rekindled. The ancient sages operated the pivot of the Dao in the boundless—thus no duality could match them. Blocking the subtle stirrings of virtue without manifesting them is like being lost in a daze, as if one’s counterpart were absent—hence showing him *Earth’s Pattern*. Seeing me *blocking the subtle stirrings of virtue*, he declared me unable to live. Earth shares its virtue with Yin, yet its affairs and patterns are one in stillness and manifestation—hence "neither quaking nor inert." "Not quaking" means not stirring; "not inert" means not clinging.

Fan says: All forms are of Earth. With form comes the strange; with mind comes the perception of strangeness. When Earth unites with emptiness and mind unites with nothingness, the Dao flows as one—what then is strange? The ancient sages’ minds were like dead ashes, their depths unfathomable. Those who perceive with delusion see only the strange.

"Not quaking" means it has never stirred; "not inert" means it has never clung. The subtle stirrings of that which is neither quaking nor inert—this is what *Earth’s Pattern* reveals, and it is precisely so. Is this not seeing me *blocking the subtle stirrings of virtue* without manifesting them?

Once again, he came. The next day, he was brought to see Master Huchi. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: "Fortunate indeed that your master has met me—he will recover. There is life now, like cold ashes rekindled. I have seen *blocked potency*." It is useful yet without gain, hence called *blocked potency*.

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Huchi. The master said: "Earlier, I showed him *Heaven-and-Earth*. As Xiang Xiu says: *Within Heaven-and-Earth, the work of covering and bearing is manifest.* Is this *Earth’s Pattern* not also external? Names and realities do not enter, yet the mechanism arises from the heels." Guo Xiang says: *It constantly arises from the utmost.* This is *blocked potency*. Is this not seeing the subtle stirrings of my goodness? As Xiang Xiu says: *When there is goodness in another, they perceive it—how shallow was Jiyan’s vision!* Lu says: *To possess potency yet not employ it is to block.* Like Heaven’s covering, its work unseen, ascending from below—names and realities have not entered, hence "there is life now." *Zhenghe* says: *The rekindling of life within cold ashes may be understood as the intent of life persisting within what is no longer ablaze.* Earlier, seeing only damp ashes, the intent of life was extinguished. Extinguished, it was deemed lifeless. Now, seeing *blocked potency*, the function of movement is still concealed. Yet since movement exists, it is deemed alive.

I showed him *Heaven-and-Earth*—*Earth* being that which has breath. What is mandated by Heaven finds its breath here, hence *Heaven-and-Earth*. When names and realities do not enter, the true and the deluded are already obscured. When the mechanism arises from the heels, this is the origin of breath—this is *blocked potency*. For the Dao cannot be seen, yet its succession is like this alone. Hence, "Is this not seeing the subtle stirrings of my goodness?"

Fan says: *Names and realities are where things reside; namelessness and formlessness are where things are empty.* When names and realities do not enter and the mechanism arises from the heels, it is as if it has never been, yet never ceased to be. Though still and without action, qi naturally arises from this. This is what is meant by *the true person’s breath reaches the heels.* Showing him *Heaven-and-Earth* was indeed fitting. At first, Jiyan saw only damp ashes and, not recognizing *blocking*, deemed it death. Only upon seeing the wholeness of life did he realize that the earlier cold ashes were *blocked potency*, not true death. Is this not seeing the subtle stirrings of my goodness?

Once again, he came. The next day, he was brought to see Master Huchi. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: "Your master sits without fasting—or perhaps the character for 'sits' is absent." Xiang Xiu says: *Without going, there is no imbalance—all is merged as one. Those who peer at Heaven through a tube see no bounds, hence the lack of fasting.* I can find no basis to assess him. Let him fast, and I shall assess him again.

Liezi entered and reported this to Master Huchi. The master said: "Earlier, I showed him *Supreme Vacuity without trace*." Xiang Xiu says: *Abiding in the utmost of Supreme Vacuity, the mind is vast and tranquil, darkly one with the ten thousand directions—no trace is visible.* Is this not seeing the subtle stirrings of my *balanced qi*? *Balanced* means level.

The whirlpool of the salamander forms a deep pool; the still water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the flowing water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the overflowing water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the gushing water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the dammed water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the dispersed water’s backflow forms a deep pool; the rich water’s backflow forms a deep pool—these are the *Nine Abysses*. The names and meanings of these waters are found in the *Erya*. Though water is one, following high and low, smooth and rugged, it differs in eddies, surges, flows, and stillness. This resembles the mind of the perfected person, which, in response to external things—difficult or easy—displays movements of activity, stillness, advance, or retreat.

Xiang Xiu says: *Whether water flows or stills, whether the salamander whirls or the dragon leaps, it remains profoundly self-possessed, never losing its quietude and silence.* Guo Xiang says: *The perfected person acts when employed, rests when set aside. Though waves surge through nine transformations, and order and chaos intermingle, abiding in the utmost, they remain serene, self-possessed, and free from action.* Lu says: *The mind moves with the qi of Supreme Vacuity, vast and traceless, yet manifesting form—its turning and flowing are unceasing, like water’s transformations in name, never departing from the clarity of the abyss. Thus, its appearance cannot be discerned or debated.*

*Zhenghe* says: *Earth’s Pattern leans toward Yin prevailing over Yang; Heaven-and-Earth leans toward Yang prevailing over Yin. As for Supreme Vacuity, it contains both Yin and Yang yet is neither Yin nor Yang. Hence, *Supreme Vacuity without trace.* *Trace* is the omen of spirit in things—Yin and Yang are unfathomable, so no trace can be perceived.* Moreover, *Vacuity* is the intersection of Yin and Yang. *Supreme Vacuity without trace* reveals only its perfect balance, hence called the *subtle stirrings of balanced qi*. The alternation of Yin and Yang, intersecting yet without trace, can be understood through the *Nine Abysses*.

*Backflow* means the reversal of current—only through reversal can wholeness be preserved. This backflow is what makes each an abyss. The whirlpool of the salamander forms a deep pool, signifying wholeness in utmost movement; the still water’s backflow forms a deep pool, signifying wholeness in possible stillness; flowing water illustrates interaction with things. Overflowing suggests excess in engagement; gushing water suggests exhaustion in reception. Damming means river water, having emerged, returns—different from exhaustion in reception. Dispersing means having emerged yet not flowing—different from returning after emergence.

Fatness means divergence in emergence yet convergence in return—here lies the full meaning of *backflow* preserving wholeness.

Yet *Zhuangzi* singles out three, for nine divided become three, and three united become one. Fan said: "Earth’s pattern is Yin; Heaven’s expanse is Yang. At their supreme intersection, the alternation of Yin and Yang is like the balanced scales of Wei—hence it is called the *subtle stirrings of balanced qi*. All dharmas are equal, without high or low; disparities arise only from deluded perception, thus nothing can be grasped or compared."

*Laozi* says: "The heart excels in abyssal depth—abyssal, empty, and still, unmingled with things. Though the waves’ transformations may differ, the abyss’s tranquil nature remains ever thus." The *supreme intersection* is much the same.

Once again, he came. The next day, he was brought to see Master Hu. Before standing firm, he lost himself and fled. Master Hu said: "Pursue him." Liezi chased him but could not catch up; returning, he reported to Master Hu: "He has vanished, he is lost—I could not reach him." Master Hu said: "Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my source."

Xiang Xiu said: "Though moving and resting with the crowd, he ever roots deeply in tranquility’s utmost." I met him with emptiness and yielding compliance—Xiang Xiu said: "Without mind, one follows change." Not knowing who or what he was—Xiang Xiu said: "Adrift, unbound by anything." Thus he took me for withered grass, for flowing waves, and so he fled. *Withered grass* should read *crumbling decay*.

Xiang Xiu said: "Transforming like crumbling decay, worldly affairs like flowing waves—wherever one turns, one is shaped by causes, thus becoming what is not oneself. Though I do not act, I move and rest with the crowd. The perfected person is one, yet responds to worldly changes with timely action—thus the physiognomist, unable to employ his mind, lost himself and fled."

Lu said: "Abandoning thought, severing念, entering non-action, utterly empty and formless—his appearance unseen, like grass bending, like waves flowing, vast and drifting, beyond the ken of spirit-mediums."

Fan said: "Ji Xian, moved by intention and perception, each time he entered, declared he saw Master Hu. But Master Hu, without intention yet responsive, each time revealed to him one with intention gazing upon one without. Ji Xian was bound by forms and calculations, never free from seeing—where he saw, he took life and death to reside, with no escape. Thus, when shown *earth’s pattern*, he lamented death; when shown *heaven’s expanse*, he rejoiced in life; when shown the *supreme intersection* without trace, he named it *unsettled*, unable to grasp or compare.

He did not know that the perfected person’s heart, still, shares virtue with Yin; moving, flows in harmony with Yang. Sharing virtue with Yin, he could not be seen—thus he was shown *earth’s pattern*. *Pattern* is what things rely upon for coherence. Flowing in harmony with Yang, he could not be seen—thus he was shown *heaven’s expanse*. *Expanse* is what things rely upon for generation. When shown the *supreme intersection* without trace, Yin and Yang were perfectly balanced, with no partiality or dominance—this is what is called the *center of Heaven and Earth*. All three are called *subtle stirrings*. Movement’s subtlety is visible, hence he could perceive them. But as for *what had never yet departed from my source*—though shown, it remained hidden, and he could not glimpse it. Thus he lost himself and fled, and pursuit could not reach him.

Yet Master Hu told Liezi: 'You nearly saw my *power of closure’s stirrings*'; he also said: 'You nearly saw my *excellent stirrings*'; he also said: 'You nearly saw my *stirrings of balanced qi*'. All spoke of 'my'—thus establishing an 'I'. But when 'I met him with emptiness and yielding compliance, not knowing who or what he was'—even I lost myself. Who was the shower? Who was the gazer?

His stillness was like grass bending, yet he knew not why it bent; his movement was like waves flowing, yet he knew not why they flowed. Seeking me in movement and stillness, he found nothing—hence he fled. Thereafter, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet studied and returned home, not emerging for three years."

Xiang Xiu said: "He abandoned the near tasks of human affairs." He cooked for his wife—Xiang Xiu said: "He forgot shame."

Feeding pigs as if feeding men—Xiang Xiu said: "He forgot distinctions of noble and base."

In affairs, he held no partiality—Xiang Xiu said: "Neither attachment nor aversion."

Carving and polishing, he returned to simplicity; solitary, he stood alone in his form—Xiang Xiu said: "The ornament of carving and polishing restored his true simplicity, and so external affairs fell away."

Sealed in primordial wholeness—Xiang Xiu said: "His truth remained undispersed."

*(Note: "戎" may also be written as "哉.")*

In this state he remained to the end—Xiang Xiu said: "Thus he attained the Dao."

Lu said: "He forgot right and wrong, equalized noble and base, leveled self and other, stilled external entanglements, ceased to be bound by the self, guarded unity to the end—only then did he accord with the real."

*Zhenghe*: "Never having departed from our origin"—for the sage takes Heaven as his origin. Concealed in Heaven, he never departed from our origin.

*(The remainder is seen in the *Zhuangzi Jie*.)*

Fan said: "To study is to study what cannot be studied. Liezi, in his approach to the Dao, had grasped its ornament but not yet its substance. Thus he considered himself as one who had never yet studied and returned home—to study what could not be studied. Three years he did not emerge, cooking for his wife, feeding pigs as if feeding men—this was the utmost forgetting of self. In affairs, he acted without partiality—this was the utmost attainment of emptiness. Carving and polishing, he returned to simplicity—having carved and polished, he reverted to unhewn wood. Solitary, he stood alone in his form—seeming to have left things and departed from men, standing in solitude. Sealed in primordial wholeness, he remained thus to the end—though myriad threads tangled and disturbed, he remained unshaken, unchanged to the last."

*End of the Fifth Scroll of the Four Commentaries on the* Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing.
*Beginning of the Sixth Scroll of the Four Commentaries on the* Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing.

Emperor Huangdi, on his way to Qi with Master Liezi, turned back mid-journey, startled that others deferred to him with such reverence—thus he dared not proceed. He encountered Bohun Maoren, who asked: "Why have you returned?"

"I was startled," he replied.

"Startled by what?"

"I dined at ten taverns selling broth, yet at five of them, the broth was offered to me first. All showed deference to one beneath them."

Bohun Maoren said: "If this is so, why are you startled?"

He answered: "Though inwardly I do not seek it, outwardly I am adorned with false dignity. My mannerisms become polished radiance, outwardly overawing others’ hearts—yet within, I am insufficient. This causes men to slight their elders and honor me instead, bringing upon me what I detest. Those broth-sellers deal only in food and surplus profit—meager gain, trifling influence—yet even they defer thus. How much more so a lord of ten thousand chariots, whose body toils for the state and whose wisdom is spent on affairs? He would entrust me with tasks and demand results of me. This is why I am startled."

Extending this principle: the lesser the gain, the slighter the expectation; the heavier the burden, the greater the demand.

The *Zhenghe* commentary states: The utmost person of antiquity, clear and plain, practiced non-action and returned to simplicity. The celestial mechanism remained unstrung; silently, he harmonized with the Dao—dim as if absent yet present, effortless as if formless yet spirit-filled. Thus, others knew him as rare and valued him. If inner sincerity remains unresolved, the heart cannot be forgotten. If mannerisms become polished radiance, the form cannot be transcended. Outwardly overawing others’ hearts, causing men to slight their elders and honor oneself—while one’s body toils for the state and one’s wisdom is spent on affairs—then the afflictions of sorrow and the comforts of joy will alternately assail the body, while the terrors of urgency and the joys of relief will mingle and drown the heart. Bringing upon oneself what one detests—how could one not be startled?

Master Fan said: The sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, preserving his form. The living conceal themselves—not disdaining depth and obscurity alone. If inner sincerity remains unresolved, one has not attained the Dao and forgotten the heart. If mannerisms become polished radiance, one has not preserved inner light without display. Dining at ten broth-sellers’ stalls and having five offer first—this is to outwardly overawe others’ hearts, causing men to slight their elders and honor oneself. The utmost person dwells motionless in a humble chamber, yet the people wander wildly, knowing not where to turn. To now cause men to slight their elders and honor oneself is to bring upon oneself what one detests—self-inflicted harm. How could this be the way of one who wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within, concealing himself?

Bo Hun Maoren said: "Excellent observation! You recognize what startles men—this is true discernment. If you master yourself, others will safeguard you. Should you remain silent and unassuming, wherever you dwell—even in Qi—none shall fear you. But if you violate this principle, you will be guarded wherever you go."

Lu said: "When one displays imposing demeanor to others, men will risk death to honor him. Yet if a ruler wearies himself with affairs, he must delegate responsibility for achievements, and with rank comes increased anxiety—this is the source of their alarm."

Bo Hun replied: "If you withdraw to preserve your true nature, concealing your radiance to erase your traces, others will safeguard you. Why? The desire to advance goodness resides in all men. Where profit abounds, all compete for it. The nature of ordinary men may rise or fall; when they recognize that fame and gain cannot be forced, they advance goodness to cultivate themselves. The study of *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* is no easy task. But if one retreats to obscurity, stilling the heart and extinguishing cleverness, free from the lure of ostentation, one gains the reputation of a good man. Thus, in the gateway of Dao-learning, both good and ill converge. The nobleman purifies his heart; the petty man reforms himself. Though they may not fully grasp it, they still benefit from following goodness."

He continued: "Thus I say, others will safeguard you." Soon after he departed, shoes filled the doorway. When the crowd returned, Bo Hun Maoren stood facing north, leaning firmly on his staff, pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he departed without a word.

The attendant informed Liezi. Liezi rushed barefoot, shoes in hand, and upon reaching the gate, asked: "Master, since you have come, have you not set aside your medicine?" (Here, *set aside* means *to neglect*—as if no healing words were offered in place of medicine.)

Lu said: "*Set aside* should read *dispense*—Master, since you have come, why not offer the medicine of your words, if only a little instruction?"

Bo Hun replied: "Enough. I already told you others would safeguard you—and indeed, they have."

"Yet it is not that you can make others safeguard you. When you align with principle in engaging with things, then things will not safeguard you. Now, turning your back on principle to move things, seeking that things not safeguard you—this cannot be attained. And you cannot cause others to not safeguard you.

Guo Xiang said: *When one acts with equanimity and transforms, there is no stirring, no seeking. Without stirring, without seeking, there is no mutual safeguarding.*

Lu said: *Your withdrawing the self and preserving integrity, severing learning and abandoning cunning—this is why others safeguard you, not because you can summon them. If you could erase traces and merge with the real, so that foolishness and wisdom were not manifest, others would likewise not know to safeguard you. From this we see: your conduct is precisely what makes others safeguard you, yet you cannot cause them not to do so. Why then stir them? By what art do you move things in this way?*

*Responding in advance with the extraordinary.*

Guo Xiang said: *Bestowing kindness before things arise—such kindness, not contingent on their prior response, is extraordinary. Yet there must be stirring. To shake the root of one’s own body—this is meaningless. If you must constantly make things stirred by you, then the natures of self and other are disturbed and altered.*

*Those who wander with you tell you nothing. They are all followers who shake the root, unable to awaken one another. Their petty words are all poison to others. Petty words, subtle and clever, easily move people—thus they harm others. Unaware, unenlightened, how can they examine one another? They cannot aid or complete one another.*"

Lu said: By what Dao do you move them? You must extol the virtues of preemptive kindness and expound extraordinary teachings, wagging your tongue to display your ability before all things. Though they may yield and follow you, what benefit does it bring? Those who dwell with you do not criticize your faults but only praise your strengths—this merely poisons your conduct, inflates your pride, and how can it lead to mutual completion?

*Zhenghe’s commentary: How excellent is the one who observes inwardly! He who masters himself is told to withdraw and conceal. The perfected person embraces the spirit and wanders among the mundane, allowing no one to glimpse his depths—thus he must master himself. If he does not master himself, others will seek to preserve him. For others to preserve you is not what is meant by "allowing no one to glimpse your depths."*

Therefore, respond only after being moved—do not seek to be extraordinary. This is how you ensure others have no means to preserve you. To respond preemptively is to act only after being moved; to display the extraordinary is to seek distinction. Those who do so not only invite others to preserve them and perceive them as exceptional, but they must also stir things, shaking the root of their own body, inevitably burdening others. Those who wander with you tell you nothing, leaving you without self-awareness. Their petty words are all poison to others, bringing only harm. Unaware, unenlightened, how can they return to the Dao?

Thus it is said: How can they examine one another? To "examine one another" means to mutually refine and bring to completion. *Fan’s commentary: To respond only after being moved, to embody the nature and embrace the spirit while wandering among the mundane—this is how you ensure others have no means to preserve you. To respond preemptively is not to act only after being moved; to display the extraordinary is not to wander among the world. If you employ such methods, you join the company of others, and ten thousand from Dengxu’s household will follow you, while the multitudes of Qi will value you thrice over. They will worship you as a corpse and sacrifice to you as a spirit. Even the humble folk of Weilei will whisper among themselves, eager to honor you among the worthy, removing their shoes at your door—such followers will soon fill your home.*

How can one who must stir things, shaking the root of their own body, ever harmonize and communicate without losing their true bearing? Thus, those who offer no guidance but only petty words become poison to others, harming their nature. And those who remain unaware and unenlightened cannot refine one another to completion.

Then, when you are offered ten jars of fermented drink and five are sent ahead as tribute, will you be truly startled?

Yang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Laozi journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance at the outskirts. They arrived in Liang and encountered Laozi. *The Zhuangzi states: Yangzi Ju—Ju being perhaps Yang Zhu’s courtesy name—did not wait for Laozi’s timing, for this is all allegory.* Midway, Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed: "At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot." For one who wanders with the perfected yet cannot shed their pride and boasting, it is said: "You cannot be taught." Yang Zhu made no reply.

Upon reaching the lodging, he presented water for washing, a towel, and a comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: "Earlier, Master, you looked up to the heavens and sighed: ‘At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but your journey afforded no pause, so I dared not speak. Now that you have stopped, may I inquire as to my fault?"

Laozi said: "Your haughty gaze and arrogant bearing—with whom do you dwell? How can you conduct yourself with such self-importance and boasting, inviting others to deceive you? The purest white appears tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient. Not contending with things, one remains humble and restrained."

Yang Zhu’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: "I respectfully receive your instruction."

On his departure, the innkeeper’s entire household came to see him off—the master held the mat, his wife the towel and comb, the lodgers left their seats, and the cook stepped away from the stove. Such was their awe of his extraordinary demeanor. On his return, the lodgers vied with him for the same seat. He had become one with things, and things did not disdain him.

Lu said: The true recluse makes no sound of self-importance, bears no appearance of self-regard. Thus, when Yang Zhu departed, people came to send him off; upon hearing his virtue and governance, the lodgers vied for his seat. The previous chapter spoke of Liezi causing others to preserve him, while this chapter shows Yang Zhu enabling others to cease preserving him.

*Zhenghe’s commentary: A skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty; a noble person of great virtue appears foolish. Those who know me are few, and thus I am esteemed. Those who adorn their wisdom to astonish the foolish, who feign eccentricity to stand apart, who self-promote and self-display—how can they speak of the Dao? Even Liezi, who had no intention of startling others, was still criticized. How much more so Yang Zhu, who altered his appearance and bearing to distinguish himself from the crowd—his being deemed "unteachable" was fitting.*

"The purest white appears tarnished" means to cleanse the profound mirror and perceive no flaw, even bearing the world’s filth, yet not cultivating one’s person to expose its stains. "The greatest virtue seems insufficient" means that virtue cannot be surpassed, yet one does not consider oneself excessive—this is what is called "the highest virtue does not act as virtue."

Yang Zhu heard the instruction and departed, and those who harmonized with him vied for his seat—this was nearly it. For on his departure, they welcomed and served him, treating him as extraordinary; on his return, those who harmonized vied for his seat, showing how lightly the crowd regarded him. Thus the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. He discards the former and embraces the latter.

*Fan’s commentary: There is no greater thief than virtue. If the heart has intent, and the intent has eyes, how much worse for one with a haughty gaze and arrogant bearing? A haughty gaze is rebellious and unyielding; an arrogant bearing is intrusive and unstraight. It is to inwardly see one’s own ruin while outwardly appearing to scheme. "The purest white appears tarnished"—though one cleanses the profound mirror and abides in constancy, the multitude despises it. "The greatest virtue seems insufficient"—though one daily renews without flaw, one does not consider oneself excessive. Discerning this truth, those who harmonize will vie for your seat.*

When ten jars of fermented drink are offered and five are sent ahead as tribute, will you be truly startled? Yang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Laozi journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance at the outskirts. They arrived in Liang and encountered Laozi. *The Zhuangzi states: Yangzi Ju—Ju being perhaps Yang Zhu’s courtesy name—did not wait for Laozi’s timing, for this is all allegory.* Laozi sighed to the heavens midway and said: "At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot." For one who wanders with the perfected yet cannot shed their pride and boasting, it is said: "You cannot be taught."

Yang Zhu passed through Song and lodged at an inn traveling east. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason. The innkeeper’s young attendant replied: "The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty. The plain one is plain in her own eyes, but I do not see her plainness." Yangzi said: "Disciples, take note. Conduct yourself with worthiness yet discard the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be beloved? Pride, arrogance, self-importance, and boasting are what ghosts, spirits, and the human Dao reject. Empty yourself to cultivate principle, and the world will delight in exalting you. Proceed thus, and who can resist you?"

Lu said: This further binds the meaning of the two preceding sections. If one can make others cherish them, how could those who do not cherish them not be envious? If one does not presume to let things cherish them, then the world will forget their faults—how much more so the innkeeper’s concubines? *Zhenghe* states: From the Dao’s perspective, things have no inherent beauty or ugliness. To know beauty as beauty is to posit ugliness as its opposite. What the world deems beautiful is called the wondrous; what it deems ugly is called the putrid. Yet the wondrous transforms into the putrid, and the putrid transforms into the wondrous—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The sage does not cling to right or wrong, beauty or ugliness, but empties the self to wander through the world. Without pride or boasting, this is what is meant by "conducting oneself with worthiness yet discarding the conduct of self-regard." None in the world contend with them in ability, nor do they contend in merit—this is what is meant by "wherever you go, will you not be beloved?"

Fan said: The Dao has no distinct forms—who is beautiful, who is ugly? When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness already exists. The Dao has no separate grades—what is noble, what is base? Viewed through things, they deem themselves noble and others base. Thus, with the innkeeper’s concubines, who knows the reason for this? Only by conducting oneself with worthiness yet discarding the conduct of self-regard will the world delight in exalting you without weariness.

The world has a Way of constant victory and a Way of constant defeat. The Way of constant victory is called softness; the Way of constant defeat is called strength. Though these two are known, they should be treated as interchangeable—yet people do not understand this. Thus, the ancients said: Strength first concerns those not equal to oneself; what it overcomes lies beneath oneself. Softness first emerges from oneself, not contending with things, so things cannot overpower it. Those "first not equal to oneself" will, when they reach equality, be imperiled—encountering an adversary, they will surely be endangered. Those "first emerging from oneself" face no peril, for principle is ever at peace.

To overcome a single person is like nothing; to bear the world is like nothing—this is called overcoming without overcoming oneself, bearing without bearing. Embracing the Way of softness and emptiness, abiding in a place of non-contention, though it be the nobility of a single person or the vastness of the world, to guide it without intent is to be like nothing. "Nothing" means emptiness and humility.

Guo Xiang said: Listen to what the ears hear, see what the eyes see, know to stop where knowledge does not reach, and act only where ability suffices. Use what is naturally usable, do what is naturally doable, follow one’s nature without contending with things—this is the Way of utmost softness. Thus, lift what lifts itself, hold what holds itself. Without the weight of a hair’s tip, I exert no force.

Lu said: Strength and softness—these two are easily known. Why, then, do people not understand them? It is because the desire to prevail is too great. When encountering those not equal to oneself, one does not yet feel strong; but when meeting an equal adversary, one is constantly in peril. With this mindset, seeking to prevail over a single person or bear the world is to be ever like a servant without respite. Those who rest in softness do not even wish to prevail over those beneath them—how much less those who surpass them? People call it not prevailing, yet I prevail over myself; I bear, yet I have never faltered.

*Laozi* says: The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.

Fan said: To aid things and prevail is superior; to prevail by force is inferior. Thus, the Way of constant victory is called softness; the Way of constant defeat is called strength. *Laozi* says: Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it. Zhuangzi, in the *Outer Chapters*, discusses the mutual affection of Kui and She, saying: "Point at me, and I prevail; swallow me, and I prevail. To break great trees and topple great houses, only I can do this." This clarifies the matter. Yet though all know that the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong, none can practice it. Only the sage can accumulate many small non-victories into a great victory.

Zhouzi said: To seek hardness, one must guard with softness; to seek strength, one must preserve with weakness. Guarding softness not to seek hardness, one naturally becomes hard; preserving weakness not to seek strength, one naturally becomes strong. Thus, hardness and strength are not what desire can attain. Accumulate softness, and one becomes hard; accumulate weakness, and one becomes strong. Observe what is accumulated to know the realm of fortune and misfortune—for fortune and misfortune arise from what is accumulated.

Strength that prevails over those not equal to oneself will, when it reaches equality, become brittle and surely break. Softness that prevails by emerging from oneself has immeasurable power.

Fan said: Softness is the root of the Dao; weakness is its function. Thus, accumulating softness must yield hardness; accumulating weakness must yield strength. Observe what is accumulated, and fortune and misfortune arise from one’s own seeking. Using strength without knowing to preserve it with weakness, what one overcomes extends only to those not equal to oneself. Using softness, one ultimately prevails over the hard—thus, what one overcomes may surpass oneself.

The reason the ancients valued abiding in a place of non-contention is that through non-contention, none in the world can contend with them. Lao Dan said: "When weapons are strong, they perish."

Wang Bi said: What all things abhor must not endure. When wood is rigid, it snaps; when strength reaches its extreme, it destroys. The soft and weak belong to the company of life; the hard and strong belong to the company of death.

Lu said: The noble person declares: The overbearing do not meet their proper end; those who delight in victory will surely encounter their match. Accumulating virtue and amassing benevolence—this is the Way of softness. *Zhenghe* states: He who gathers many small victories to form a great victory—only the sage can achieve this. Laozi said: Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it, for there is nothing that can replace it. If there were something to replace it, one would follow others and lose oneself—how then could one prevail over things? Only by having nothing to replace it does one remain constant amid ten thousand changes, so that nothing can overcome it. This is called the Way of constant victory. The Way of constant victory is called softness; the Way of constant defeat is called strength. These two are easy to know, yet people do not understand them—this is what Laozi meant by "softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength," which all under heaven know but none can practice. Strength first overcomes those not equal to oneself; softness first emerges from within. He who first overcomes those not equal to himself will, when he reaches those equal to himself, be in peril. He who first emerges from within will never be in peril. For one who opposes the world with the Dao will surely meet his match; the timid, yielding, and humble gallop through the world’s utmost hardness. This is precisely the meaning. To overcome a single person or a multitude with this, or to bear the world’s burdens with this, is to extend from the self to all under heaven—only those who follow the company of softness and weakness can truly bear such a task. For they do not seek to overcome things but overcome themselves; they do not rely on others but rely on themselves.

When armies clash, the side that grieves prevails—thus it is said, "When weapons are strong, they perish." The carpenter knows to nurture the young paulownia or catalpa, but when they grow strong, he fells and measures them. Thus it is said, "When wood is rigid, it snaps." All things bear yin and embrace yang, blending through the harmonizing qi. Yang’s virtue is to bring forth life; yin’s function is to bring stern execution. When stern execution prevails, the harmonizing qi is lost. Thus it is said: The soft and weak belong to the company of life; the hard and strong belong to the company of death.

Fan said: The tradition states: The hard and strong dwell below; the soft and weak reside above. For softness overcomes hardness, and weakness overcomes strength—this is where Laozi’s arts of the Dao lie. Thus *Zhuangzi* said: "Take timidity, weakness, and humility as one’s outward form." Appearance need not be uniform to share the same wisdom; wisdom need not be uniform to share the same appearance. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Do they love those whose appearance resembles their own and fear those whose appearance differs? Possessing a seven-foot frame, differing hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human, yet humans are not without bestial hearts. Though they may have bestial hearts, their appearance makes them beloved. With wings and horns, fangs and claws, flying aloft or crouching to run—this is called a bird or beast, yet birds and beasts are not without human hearts. Though they may have human hearts, their appearance makes them estranged.

Fuxi, Nüwa, Shennong, and the Xia sovereigns—serpent-bodied with human faces, ox-headed with tiger noses—possessed forms not of humankind yet bore the great sagely virtue. Human appearances naturally include features resembling birds and beasts, and many ancient sages bore extraordinary visages. The so-called "serpent-bodied with human face" does not mean scaled and belly-crawling, devoid of limbs; "ox-headed with tiger nose" does not mean horned and dewlapped, with broad foreheads and slack jaws—just as physiognomy speaks of tortoise backs, crane strides, kite shoulders, and hawk beaks.

Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu—though their forms and seven apertures were identical to humans—harbored the hearts of birds and beasts. Yet the multitude clings to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom—how could this suffice?

Lu observes: What strange creatures cherish is spirit; when spirit departs, even the bond between father and child becomes estranged. Thus, in nights of terror, sharing a roof with living beings brings no fear, for their spirits are akin. Yet in an ordinary dwelling, sharing a room with a corpse induces dread, for their spirits differ. Though the dead and the living share the same former form, one feels secure and the other terrified—because kindred spirit departs, and form alone cannot foster closeness. How deluded are those who, ignorant of the shared spirit among living things, take the sameness or difference of appearance as the measure of intimacy!

Thus *Zhuangzi* states: What all things share is spirit, and spirit is the master of nurturing life.

Fan remarks: Mencius said, "That by which humans differ from birds and beasts is slight; the multitude abandons it, while the noble person preserves it." Seeking beyond the physical frame, one finds that though forms may be alike, wisdom need not be the same. Seeking within the physical frame, one finds that though wisdom may be alike, forms need not be the same. Thus, some ancient figures possessed non-human forms yet bore great sagely virtue, while others shared human forms yet harbored the hearts of birds and beasts—it lies solely in whether one preserves or abandons it.

When the Yellow Emperor battled the Flame Emperor at the wilds of Banquan, he marshaled bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, boars, and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, hawks, falcons, and kites as his banners—this was commanding birds and beasts by force. When Yao tasked Kui with overseeing music, striking and tapping the stones, the hundred beasts danced in unison, and when the *Xiaoshao* melody reached its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was summoning birds and beasts by sound. If so, how do the hearts of birds and beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and voices differ from ours, yet we know not the way to connect with them. The sage, knowing all and penetrating all, thus draws them forth and commands them.

The wisdom of birds and beasts naturally includes aspects akin to human innocence. In aligning desires and preserving life, they require no borrowed wisdom from humans: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they shun flatlands and cling to perilous heights, flee the cold and seek the warm; at rest they form groups, in motion they march in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking they accompany one another, when feeding they call in flocks. In the age of great antiquity, they dwelled alongside humans and walked among them. Where virtue was pure, birds and beasts harbored no fear. By the time of the Five Emperors, they began to scatter in alarm. By the final age, they hid and fled to evade harm. When humans harbor the intent to harm living things, those things too know to avoid them.

Fan observes: If they can be commanded by force and summoned by sound, then the hearts of birds and beasts naturally share something with humans. If in aligning desires and preserving life they require no aid from humans, then the wisdom of birds and beasts naturally includes aspects akin to human innocence. In an age of perfect virtue, when simplicity remained unspoiled, birds and beasts could be leashed and roam freely, and the nests of magpies and crows could be climbed to peer within. But in later ages, when cunning disrupted the world, when bows, crossbows, traps, and snares proliferated, birds were thrown into chaos above. When snares, nets, and pitfall traps multiplied, beasts were thrown into chaos in the marshes. Thus, even the creeping insects and fluttering creatures lost their true nature.

Now, in the eastern land of the Jie clan, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is but a fragment of partial knowledge. The tortoise and dragon are the lords of shelled and scaled creatures; the qilin and phoenix are the chiefs of feathered and furred beings...

Where it extends to the flying midges and creeping worms, all cry out in mutual resonance, each with its own intent and inclination—how does their mutual mastery differ from that of humans? Yet men, unable to comprehend, claim the sounds of birds and beasts lack structure or pattern. Thus, those who exhaust principle and perfect knowledge open myriad paths of understanding; those who grasp but a single thread through partial experience may chance upon one strand, as in the *Zuo Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals*: Jie Gelu heard an ox low and said, "This one will sire four calves, all to be sacrificial victims."

The divine sages of high antiquity, knowing fully the dispositions of all things, understood completely the voices of different kinds. Gathering and assembling them, they instructed and received instruction, treating them as kin to humankind. Thus, they first convened ghosts, spirits, and mountain demons—Yu’s assembly of the host of spirits at Mount Kuaiji being one such instance. Next, they reached the peoples of the eight directions, and lastly, they gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths—hence the saying that "the hundred beasts led the dance." This speaks to how creatures of blood and qi, though distant in form, share a commonality of heart and mind. The divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.

Lu notes: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records Jie Gelu hearing an ox’s low and knowing it would bear four sacrificial calves; Yu’s assembly of spirits and Shun’s dance of the hundred beasts are such examples.

Zhenghe observes: Earlier scholars took *tong* (童) as "same," and this should be considered correct. In the age of perfect virtue, all was as if without knowledge, its power undivided; all was as if without desire, called "pristine simplicity." Thus, humans dwelt alongside birds and beasts in flocks, mingling with the ten thousand things. Birds and beasts could be leashed and roam freely; the nests of magpies and crows could be climbed to peer within. Might the battles of the Yellow Emperor at Banquan and the musical attainments of Emperor Yao have arisen from this?

Jie Gelu heard the lowing of an ox in the time of Cheng Zhou, when offices were established to raise and teach birds and beasts, tame them, and even converse with them. Thus, they fully understood the voices of different kinds, gathering and instructing them. Traces of this persisted into later ages, as in the *Liezi*, which laments the scattering of pure simplicity, seeking the intent of the Dao and virtue, and embedding it in its text. Though the age had shifted toward cunning, it still aspired to restore the realm of unadulterated thickness, and so its words touched upon this.

Fan notes: The *Rites of Zhou* records that the *lu* officials were tasked with speaking to beasts, showing that understanding the speech of the six domestic animals was indeed a matter of comprehensive knowledge. Yet these chirps and cries, without skilled discernment, could not be engaged. Thus, Boyi mastered the voices of birds in speech, while Gelu distinguished the sounds of lowing oxen.

In Song, there was a man called Master Ju, who loved raising monkeys and was thus named for them. He cherished the monkeys, keeping them in troops, and could understand their intent, just as they grasped his heart. He diminished his household’s provisions to satisfy the monkeys’ desires. Soon, however, he faced scarcity and sought to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: "I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four at dusk. Is that enough?" The monkeys all rose in anger. Then he said: "I will give you chestnuts—four in the morning and three at dusk. Is that enough?" The monkeys all prostrated themselves in joy. Things that use their abilities to deceive and entrap one another all follow this pattern. The sage uses wisdom to entrap the multitude of fools, just as Master Ju used wisdom to entrap his monkeys. Names and realities remain unharmed, yet their joy and anger are manipulated.

Lu says: Though creatures possessing consciousness share the same spirit, those with round heads and square feet—humans—are the most intelligent. The most outstanding in wisdom become sages and worthies; the greatest in talent become kings. The sage assigns tasks according to ability, ensuring all—great or small—are rightly placed. Neither people nor things are discarded; all are entrapped by wisdom—how could this apply only to monkeys?

Zhenghe observes: The ancients who were skilled in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple. For the people may be led but not made to understand. Thus, those skilled in the Way merely guide them, reversing their usual state. The Way can be carried and shared with them, leaving no room for the exercise of cunning.

Fan says: In ancient times, those who spoke of deceit would call it "monkey deceit," for monkeys, by nature, are keen observers and fond of trickery. Thus, they exploit their cleverness, rely on their agility, feign appearances at odds with their true feelings, and harbor suspicion toward wisdom. Deceitful wisdom serves only to entrap. Though names and realities remain unharmed, joy and anger are put to use. Yet the monkeys, kept by Master Ju, were tossed between three and four, never realizing their plight—was this not because they were entrapped by what they loved?

Ji Xiaozhi raised fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: "Are the cocks ready to fight?" He replied: "Not yet. They are still vain and arrogant, relying on their qi, lacking substance yet full of self-importance." After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: "Not yet. They still respond to shadows and movements, quick to take offense." After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: "Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi, ever seeking an enemy and insisting on victory." After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: "Nearly so."

Though other cocks may crow, this one remains unchanged. When an opponent challenges, it does not respond—victory and defeat are forgotten. Beholding it, one sees but a wooden cock; its virtue is complete. To attain such wholeness is to transcend the realm of blood and qi. No other cock dares engage it; they turn and flee. One whose virtue is complete not only harbors no intent within but also prevents external things from arising in opposition.

Guo Xiang says: To nurture it to such completeness is to render it invulnerable to external foes—how much more so when one attains wholeness oneself?

Lu observes: Relying on qi and self-importance is no path to certain victory. Reacting to things with the swiftness of echo and shadow is to be turned by them, not to attain mastery. Fierce glares and surging qi betray a mind still entangled in calculation. Only one who forgets form and spirit, who remains unmoved by life and death, is truly invincible before external things.

In the *Zhenghe* edition: He who excels at overcoming foes does not contend. Precisely because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him. To still the mind, one must first calm the qi; to attain spirit, one must follow the heart—this is the virtue of non-contention. Such a one preserves heaven’s wholeness, his spirit unassailable; how could external things find entry? Though he may clash with the world, he is not cowed, nor can the world harm him. This is the steadfastness of pure qi, not the realm of cunning, skill, or reckless daring. Such is the person of complete virtue.

Fan says: A cock, though domesticated by man, remains subject to greater forces—thus its nurture cannot be without dependence. Vain and reliant on its own qi, it cannot yet be free of self-importance; responsive to echoes and shadows, it cannot yet be free of reaction. Fierce glares and surging qi reveal a lingering desire for victory. But when, though other cocks may crow, this one remains unmoved—when it appears as a wooden cock—then its nurture is complete, and no foe dares challenge it. If mere physical wholeness suffices for this, how much more so for one of complete virtue?

Hui Ang, grandson of Hui Shi, was received by King Kang of Song. The king stamped his foot, cleared his throat, and spoke rapidly: "What pleases me is courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you bring?" Hui Ang replied: "I possess a Way by which, though a man be brave, piercing him will not penetrate; though he be strong, striking him will not land. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of this?" The king of Song said: "Excellent. This is what I desire to hear."

Hui Ang replied: "That one may pierce without penetrating, strike without landing—this is still humiliation. I possess a Way by which, though a man be brave, he will not dare to pierce; though he be strong, he will not dare to strike. That he does not dare is not because he lacks the will. I possess a Way by which a man fundamentally lacks such will. When one lacks such will, there has never been a heart that loves or seeks advantage. I possess a Way by which all men and women under heaven, without exception, joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses mere courage and strength—it stands above the four burdens."

(For the king ranks above ministers, grandees, officers, and commoners, hence the term "four burdens.")

The king of Song said: "This is what I desire to attain."

Lu observed: "Piercing without penetrating, striking without landing—this is the first. Not daring to pierce, not daring to strike—this is the second. Fundamentally lacking the will to strike—this is the third. Causing men and women to joyfully love and benefit one another—this is the fourth. If one achieves two of these four, how would that compare?"

Thus the king of Song inclined his mind to hear it.

Hui Ang replied: "Confucius and Mo Di embodied this."

Lu remarked: "This is the illumination of wisdom to harmonize all things, the exaltation of teaching to transform people—both are the residual affairs of the Way ascending to virtue. Confucius and Mo Di, though they had no land to rule as lords nor office to lead as officials, yet all men and women under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess such will, then all within your four borders will receive its benefit—your worth will far surpass that of Confucius and Mo Di."

The king of Song had no reply. Hui Ang hastened out.

The king of Song said to his attendants: "How eloquent! The guest has persuaded me with his discourse."

Lu observed: "This is the exaltation of the Way to manifest virtue, the bequeathing of traces to benefit people. The multitude sees only the transmission of Confucius’ and Mo Di’s teachings—how could they know the hidden Way that makes virtue resplendent? Thus, when one inquires after the ford, they do not flock with the birds and beasts. This is its great purport."

*Zhenghe* states: "The sage’s way in the world is divine martiality without killing, treasuring compassion as his jewel. Thus, when benevolence extends to all under heaven, none do not cherish it; when righteousness extends to all under heaven, none do not submit. This is called the constant Way of victory—it far surpasses mere courage and strength. This is why all under heaven love and benefit from it."

(That Confucius is mentioned alongside Mo Di: *Zhuangzi* discusses the arts of the Way in antiquity, where the Hundred Schools and various techniques each had their strengths. Though Mo Di’s grasp of the Way was not comprehensive, he was still a talented scholar with particular virtues.)

Fan remarked: "One who has a heart that loves and seeks advantage has not yet enabled others to forget the self. Hui Ang’s words stop here, merely addressing King Kang of Song. That this chapter concludes with these words—could it be that the constant Way of victory also lies herein?"

Gathered by He Guang the Scattered Light Daoist, Gao Shouyuan
*King Mu of Zhou*

That which receives life and accepts form is called "embodiment"; the transformations of bowing and rising are called "change." Where spirit intermingles is called "dream"; where form makes contact is called "waking." Tracing them to their ultimate, both converge in emptiness and illusion.

Why is this? The root of living substance is stagnant, and after a hundred years it comes to an end; the branches of transformative nature are shallow, vanishing in the blink of an eye. The Dao of spirit is indistinct, now present, now absent; the principles of form are manifest, now real, now solid. Thus, one who thoroughly perceives knows that the principles of arising and ceasing are equal, and the paths of waking and dreaming are one. Though ten thousand changes intermingle, they do not touch the spirit’s contemplation.

The deluded, taking the manifest and obscure as proof, hesitate over the slowness or swiftness of verification and thus doubt. Secretly, they cling to self-interest, taking the bodily frame as their true dwelling. Who recognizes that the root and return of life and transformation lie in nothingness?

Lu remarked: Heaven and earth form vessels, encompassing all things. Human beings live within them, merely preserving their existence. They never realize that spirit governs form, unbound by existence. This is why the sage nurtures the root, while the foolish only know how to nurture their form, constricting themselves to life. Greedy for life yet unaware of life’s master, they take the decay of form as death, ignorant of the spirit’s enduring presence. The deluded become ordinary people; the enlightened attain sagely wisdom. The confused are many. Thus, the enlightened are first discussed to clarify the distinction.

*Zhenghe*: The Dao has no true or false; things have that and this. Like dreams and waking, they generate their own confusion. Only the great sage knows them, uniting all as one.

Fan remarked: Those attached to existence are separated by the slightest thread; those awakened to nothingness see the ten thousand dharmas as one source. One who embodies the Dao roams freely in the ancestor of the ten thousand things, transcending form to wander with the transformed beings. Comprehending the subtleties of principle, they silently harmonize with the Creator, equalizing the principles of life and death, unifying the paths of dream and waking. Though existence and annihilation, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and aversion—none of these are known. Though heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—none are distinguished. The Great Void is without thing; returning to the dwelling of nature, naturally—who would toil over things as matters of concern?

In the time of King Mu of Zhou, a transformed being came from the westernmost land. A master of illusion, he entered water and fire, pierced metal and stone, reversed mountains and rivers, and moved cities. Riding the void, he did not fall; touching the solid, he was not obstructed. His thousand changes and ten thousand transformations could not be exhausted. Having already altered the forms of things, he further transformed people’s thoughts, temporarily causing them to forget their long-held knowledge.

*Zhenghe*: One who knows the Dao of transformation—does this not mean knowing the workings of spirit? Unharmed by water or fire, unobstructed by metal or stone, high and low as one, void and solid both forgotten—his thousand changes and ten thousand transformations cannot be exhausted. This, too, is spirit. Yet spirit is that which subtly pervades the ten thousand things yet cannot be fathomed. Altering the forms of things and transforming people’s thoughts—this is merely exhausting calculations and mastering change, shifting and altering according to form. This is why he is called a "transformed being."

King Mu revered him as a spirit and served him as a lord. Lu remarked: The thoughts of ordinary people extend no further than desires, aversions, external gains, and benevolence and righteousness. The transformed being now returns them to their true nature—hence, it is said he "transforms" them. The transformed being is a body responsive to things, exhausting sagely wisdom and boundless application, his thousand changes and ten thousand transformations never reaching an end.

He spread out bedding for him to reside in, presented the three sacrificial animals to him, and selected female musicians to entertain him. The transformed being found the king’s palace crude and unfit to dwell in, the king’s kitchen fare rank and inedible (the stench of mole crickets), and the king’s consorts foul and unlovable.

Lu remarked: Finding the king’s palace crude, his kitchen fare rank, and his consorts foul clarifies that the transformed being did not value sensory pleasures, flavors, or dwellings.

King Mu then had it rebuilt for him. The labor of earth and timber, the red and white of ochre and plaster—no craft was spared. The five treasuries were emptied before the terrace was completed. A thousand *ren* high, overlooking the summit of Zhongnan, it was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected the most graceful and delicate maidens from Zheng and Wei, their beauty enchanting and their forms supple. He applied fragrant unguents, painted their moth-like brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings (earplugs), dressed them in fine silk and delicate linen, trailing gauze and fine silk. Powdered white and darkened with black, they wore jade pendants and rings, mingled with fragrant herbs, filling the terrace and pavilions. He performed the *Bearing Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to entertain him (*Bearing Clouds* was the music of the Yellow Emperor; *Six Radiance*, that of Emperor Ku; *Nine Shao*, that of Shun; *Morning Dew*, that of Tang). Every month, jade robes were offered; every dawn, jade delicacies were presented—such were their precious rarities.

Yet the transformed being still did not appear pleased, only reluctantly ascending it.

Lu remarked: The king did not grasp his intent and further embellished it. The transformed being still remained unmoved, making clear that his heart was not in these things.

*Zhenghe*: What the world deems beautiful is called "divine and marvelous"; what it detests is called "foul and rotten." Divine and marvelous, foul and rotten—each transforms into the other. Then how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished? The transformed being found the king’s palace, kitchen fare, and consorts unacceptable and insisted on rebuilding and selecting anew before ascending. This shows he had not yet forgotten the passions of beauty and ugliness. Thus, King Mu revered him only as a spirit.

Fan remarked: Confucius said, "If one does not transform with the transformed being, how can one transform others?" The so-called "transformed being"—is he not also one who has transformed into a human? Thus, water and fire can be entered and pierced, mountains and rivers reversed and moved. With nothingness entering the spaceless, he does not fall into the void;

With nothingness of thickness entering the spaceless, he is not hindered by solidity. Myriad transformations, boundless and inexhaustible—he has no fixed form. There are those who alter the shapes of things, yet without thought. There are those who shift the concerns of men—these are called "transformed beings," and it is only fitting they be thus. King Mu then fully honored the Way of serving them, offering his own bedchamber for their residence, yet they knew not its baseness and unfitness; he presented the three sacrificial animals to them, yet they knew not the stench and foulness of what could not be consumed; he selected female musicians to entertain them, yet they knew not the rankness and repugnance of what could not be embraced. Thereupon he built the Terrace of Central Heaven, selected the bearing of Zheng and Wei, performed the music of *Yunshao*, presented jade robes, and offered jade delicacies—yet still they remained unmoved. Unable to do otherwise, he attended them. This was merely to follow their encounter and settle in one dwelling, abiding in what could not be avoided. After but a short stay, they requested the king join them in travel. The king grasped the sleeve of the transformed being—*qu*, meaning the sleeve of a robe—and soaring upward, they halted only at Central Heaven. When they reached the palace of the transformed beings, its halls were wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, rising above clouds and rain, its foundations unseen below, appearing like piled clouds from afar. All that the eyes beheld and ears heard, all that the nose inhaled and mouth tasted, were unlike anything of the human realm. The king truly believed it to be the *Qingdu* and *Ziwei*, the abode of the Celestial Emperor, where the vast music of *Juntian* resounded. *Qingdu* and *Ziwei* are the dwelling places of the Celestial Emperor. Tradition records that Duke Mu of Qin, stricken with illness and insensible, awoke and said: "I was at the Emperor’s court, where it was most joyous. With a hundred spirits I roamed *Juntian*, where the vast music played nine suites and myriad dances, unlike the music of the Three Dynasties—its sound stirred the heart." Another account says the same befell Viscount Jian of Zhao. The king looked down and saw his own palaces and pavilions like heaped clods and piled straw.

The king believed he had dwelled there for decades without once longing for his kingdom—such is what is meant by "transforming a man’s thoughts."

Lu said: "The heart of the Central Heaven is the most numinous of minds. As King Mu could not instantly forget his desires, the transformation manifested in the splendor of palaces to seize his cherished heart." The *huaren* again invited the king to journey together. Wherever they went, above they saw neither sun nor moon, below they saw neither rivers nor seas. Where light and shadow fell, the king’s eyes blurred and could not see; where sounds arose, his ears confused and could not hear. His hundred bones and six viscera quivered and would not settle, his mind grew lost, his essence scattered, and he begged the *huaren* to return. The realm of the vast and indistinct is not a place mortals may tread—confusion of heart and eyes is the natural course.

*Zhenghe* said: "To say the king truly believed it the *Qingdu* and *Ziwei*, the *Juntian* and vast music, the Celestial Emperor’s abode, is to make clear it was not so. Wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, all that eyes beheld, ears heard, nose inhaled, and mouth tasted were unlike anything of the human realm. Yet the king came to forget his kingdom—so great was his joy. But where they journeyed, above he saw neither sun nor moon, below neither rivers nor seas; his eyes could not see, his ears could not hear, his mind grew lost, his essence scattered, and he begged the *huaren* to return—so great was his distress. This is what is meant by 'altering the forms of things and transforming a man’s thoughts.'"

The *huaren* shifted him—*shifted*, meaning *pushed*. The king seemed to fall through emptiness. *Fell*, meaning *plummeted*.

Lu said: "The ultimate principle is precisely the place the *huaren* reached. All phenomena are utterly exhausted—how could sun, moon, rivers, or seas remain? All common delusions are swept away—how could light or shadow persist? The mortal form cannot abide there, the ordinary heart has never known it, and though his attachments were not yet forgotten, he begged to return."

When he awoke, he still sat where he had before, his attendants still the same as before. Before him, the wine had not yet cleared, the dishes had not yet spoiled. The king asked where he had come from, and his attendants said: "Your Majesty merely sat in silent contemplation." Thereafter, King Mu remained disoriented for three months before recovering. He questioned the *huaren* again, asking why his form had not moved.

Lu said: "Free from the cares of clinging, one enters the realm of serene illumination—within a single thought, a myriad ages cannot compare. The domain of the perfected, how could it be some other sacred realm? Thus the wine had not yet cleared, the dishes had not yet spoiled. The attendants saw the king sitting in silence, yet he had gone nowhere; the king, lost in sitting-forgetfulness for three months, dared not ask further."

The *huaren* said: "I traveled with Your Majesty in spirit—how could the form have moved? What is called 'spirit' moves not swiftly yet arrives instantly, goes not forth yet reaches all. To illustrate with a common example: in a single night’s slumber, one may dream a hundred years’ events, or behold things from the farthest realms. While awake, in the brief span of a bow or a glance, one may yet roam beyond the six directions. If wayward thoughts and wanton fancies can achieve this, how much more so when the spirit-heart moves alone, unshackled from form and vessel, perfectly penetrating and mystically illuminating, silently congealed in emptiness?

Moreover, was the place we dwelled before any different from Your Majesty’s palace? Was the garden we wandered any different from Your Majesty’s own?"

The king, accustomed to the familiar, doubted what briefly vanished. Yet that and this—both are not true things. To grow used to what always remains and doubt what briefly vanishes is the delusion of the heart. At the extreme of transformation, between swift and slow, can any pattern be grasped? Transformation cannot be exhausted, nor can the principle of swift and slow be divided—seeking to trace its image with the mind’s intelligence is beyond measure.

Lu said: The spirit’s divergence from form is thus made clearer. The king, merely habituated to common sights, harbors doubt about what briefly vanishes. But for one who has attained the utmost Dao and constantly dissolves his form—what doubt could remain? The spirit’s transformations, swift or slow, cannot be fully described.

*Annotation in Zhenghe*: When the spirit-heart is in a state of vagueness, weaving through the ten thousand directions, then the spirit’s journey is swift. In the span of a bow or a glance, one may yet roam beyond the four seas—no need for the form to move, for the heart moves with it.

People of the world take what is constantly present as real and what is constantly absent as illusory. Thus, they grow accustomed to what always remains and cast doubt upon what briefly vanishes. Clinging to being and rejecting emptiness, they are blinded by partiality, unaware that neither that nor this is truly real. Once this is understood, how then is the place we dwelled before any different from Your Majesty’s palace? How is the garden we wandered any different from Your Majesty’s own?

Fan said: The Transformed One’s palace was wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, rising above clouds and rain, its foundations unseen below, appearing like a mass of clouds when viewed from afar. How would it compare to the terraces of mid-heaven? What the eyes saw and ears heard, what the nose inhaled and mouth tasted—none of it belonged to the human realm. How then would it compare to the postures of Zheng and Wei, the music of *Yunshao*, the presentation of jade robes and offering of jade food? The king truly believed it to be the Clear Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the vast music of the Heaven of Equal Power, the abode of the Emperor—never realizing that the forms of things could change and human thoughts be altered to such a degree.

Thus, when he looked down upon it, the palaces and pavilions seemed but piled clods and heaped straw—so the mutability of things’ forms became clear. The king had lived there for over a decade without longing for his kingdom—so the alteration of human thoughts became clear. Yet this was still but a beginning, not the ultimate attainment.

Therefore, the Transformed One again invited the king to journey together. Wherever they went, above they saw no sun or moon—so it was not the place said to "above, reveal light." Below they saw no rivers or seas—so it was not the place said to "below, become earth." The radiance that shone there dazzled the king’s eyes, so he could not see, for he had not yet attained the clarity of vision. The sounds that came assailed the king’s ears, so he could not hear, for he had not yet attained the harmony of hearing. His hundred bones and six viscera trembled without settling; his mind was lost, his essence scattered. He begged the Transformed One to return, terrified by the vastness, trembling in alarm, nearly undone—then suddenly awoke.

He found himself still seated where he had been before, his attendants unchanged, the wine before him still clear, the dishes uneaten. The king asked where he had come from, unaware that he had silently remained there while his form had never stirred. Thus was this called a spirit-journey.

Only the spirit—swift without haste, arriving without going, standing in the unfathomable, roaming in nothingness—can in a bow or a glance traverse the four seas, in vagueness weave through the ten thousand directions. How could form ever burden it? Truly understanding this, one sees that the extremes of transformation, the intervals of swift and slow, lie within oneself. How distant, then, is the Transformed One’s palace?

The king rejoiced greatly, no longer concerned with state affairs or delighting in ministers and concubines. Moved by these profound words, he abandoned all thought of the world’s order or disorder, forgot the hierarchy of ruler and subject. He gave himself wholly to far wanderings.

Lu said: *"The Zhuangzi* speaks of those who value the Dao, who abandon the world without a backward glance—this is like treating dust, grime, or husks as though they could mold a Yao or Shun. Who would take such things as their concern? Moreover, the drowning in sounds and sights, in cravings and desires—how could these be what the Dao delights in? Thus the king rejoiced greatly in this Way, no longer concerned with state affairs or delighting in ministers and concubines. To wander far is to forget what lies close at hand."

He commanded the harnessing of the Eight Steeds: on the right trace, *Lü* and *Green Ear*; on the left, *Red Qi* and *White Yi*. The chariot-master was Zaofu, his whip poised between heaven and earth. In the second chariot, the right trace bore *Quhuang* and the left *Yulun*; the left trace, *Daoli* and the right *Shanzi*. Baitian drove the lead chariot, Canbai served as charioteer, and Benrong rode at the right. They galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the Giant Sou clan. The Giant Sou presented the blood of a white swan for the king to drink and offered the milk of cows and horses to wash his feet—bestowing upon the Most Revered what they themselves held most precious, and likewise upon the two chariots’ attendants. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Waters. *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "Kunlun Mountain has waters of five colors." The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun, beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it to bequeath to later ages. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted them upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West was a human figure with tiger’s teeth, disheveled hair adorned with a sheng-crown, and a talent for whistling—so *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* records. She sang for the king a wandering song, a day-song called *White Clouds*. The king harmonized with her, his response a poem titled *Returning East*. Its words were mournful. Then they beheld the place where the sun sets. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: "He ascended Yan Mountain, traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day." The king sighed and said: "Alas! I alone am deficient in virtue yet in harmony with joy—harmony with eloquence. Will later ages recount my transgressions?" All from the passage beginning "He commanded the harnessing of the Eight Steeds" to this point is found in *The Chronicle of King Mu*.

King Mu was nearly a spirit-man! Yet he was not. As the *Zhenghe* edition notes: "The spirit is swift without haste, arrives without going." King Mu did not understand this. Though his comings and goings within the Six Directions were bound to this principle, he still commanded chariots and steeds, traveling ten thousand *li* in a day. Thus, though he reached the land of the Giant Sou, ascended the heights of Kunlun, beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and was received by the Queen Mother upon the Jasper Pool, he did not ride the clouds and qi, mount the flying dragons, and wander beyond the Four Seas. Hence it is said: "Nearly a spirit-man"—he approached the spirit yet was not spirit. Able to exhaust the joys of his own lifetime, he knew that a hundred years would still pass, that worldly affairs are without constancy, and so he gave free rein to his heart. The world believed he had ascended in transcendence. The character *jia* should be read as *xia* ("far"); the world’s belief in his "ascension" makes clear that he truly died.

Lu said: To select the finest steeds and discern worthy talents, to employ them as circumstances demand without distinction between Chinese and barbarian lands—only the Dao’s direction is not distant. The palace of the Yellow Emperor exhausts all that heaven and earth possess, the utmost of what divine knowledge can expound. Yet it does not exalt virtue to boast of its use, but delights in the Dao to commune with the spirit. Transforming and ascending for a thousand years, the common people believed he had departed far away.

Fan said: King Mu, awakened by the words of the Transformed One, no longer concerned himself with state affairs, ministers, or concubines. He harnessed the Eight Steeds, journeyed to the land of the Giant Sou, lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, sealed the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and feasted upon the Jasper Pool. Giving free rein to his far wanderings, traveling ten thousand *li* in a day—this could indeed be called spirit-like. Yet to speak of riding the clouds and qi, mounting the flying dragons, and wandering beyond the Four Seas—this he had not achieved. Thus he was deemed merely "nearly a spirit."

Lao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years without receiving instruction. Lao Chengzi requested to hear his faults and sought leave to depart. Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into the chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke: "When the Old Master Lao Dan departed for the west, he turned to me and said: 'The qi of living beings, the forms of shaped things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang transform—this is called life, this is called death. Exhausting the numbers and grasping the changes, shifting and altering forms—this is called transformation, this is called illusion. Mastering the numbers of the Two Modes, holding fast to the principles of yin and yang—one molds and moves the ten thousand forms without sensing difficulty. The Creator’s skill is subtle, its work profound—truly difficult to exhaust or bring to an end. Does the Creator have a heart? It is naturally and wondrously so. When qi and substance are coarse and thin, congealing to form shapes, they follow transformation in their course, and thus do not immediately dissipate. That which relies on form displays its skill openly, its work is shallow, and so it arises and perishes in an instant. Those who borrow things to enact changes, who shift with the formation of shapes—these are born for a moment, vanish for a moment. Their work is manifest, their deeds conspicuous, and so all things are startled. Only when one knows that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can one begin to study illusion.' The annotations in the chapter headings have already explained this in detail. You and I are also illusion—why study further? The body is illusion; to desire to study illusion is to have illusion study illusion."

Lu said: The changes of form and qi are ever-renewing, never abiding—how are they different from illusion? Thus, what the spirit and qi transform endures long and is difficult to know; what techniques and arts create is near and easy to see. Yet do people not recognize this? The difficult-to-know is the great illusion; the easy-to-see is the small illusion. If one knows that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death, why study further?

Lao Chengzi returned home and, applying Master Yin Wen’s words, pondered deeply for three months. Thereafter he could freely control life and death, reverse the four seasons—summoning thunder in winter, creating ice in summer—making the flying run and the running fly.

Deep contemplation for even a moment may yield the Dao—how much more so for those who attain it without conscious thought? Life necessarily follows principle; form necessarily follows life. There has never been life without principle, nor form without life. Life and form, form and principle—though differing in subtlety and coarseness, they alternate as guest and host, flowing and shifting without the slightest pause. Thus, they are ever-changing and impermanent, now gathering, now dispersing. When one grasps their order, their workings remain hidden yet their effects become manifest; when cultivation loses its measure, their traces appear and their transformations become evident.

Now, if the commands of the four seasons do not err, the three luminaries fall into disorder; when thunder and ice reverse their seasons, and vessels melt and scorch, then flying embers and drifting sands coalesce into surging waters. These are taken as ordinary, and none doubt them. Extending this principle to exhaust the subtleties of yin and yang and the nature of the myriad things, one may mold and shape all existence, matching the workings of creation itself.

As for those who master only partial arts, drawing upon qi and physical form—bowing and rising, they emerge and submerge; glancing about, they make the flying run and the running fly—these are but the lesser techniques. If one never clings to such arts throughout life, they will naturally remain untransmitted in the world. The Dao of the sage is used daily, yet the common people do not know it; displaying wonders to astonish the age is the way of ordinary men.

Lu said: To fathom the root of spirit and qi, to discern the source of life and death, is to attain boundless transformation—this is an inevitable principle. It must be realized through personal insight and embodied verification, for it cannot be transmitted through words or texts.

*Governance and Harmony*: One may journey with those who are ready, guiding them to the subtle Dao. But should one bow and usher them into the chamber? Those unready for this path must not be led. When one dismisses attendants to speak privately, it is because the movements of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, and the principles of the myriad things arise in an instant and vanish in a flash. Thus, it is said: the qi of life, the forms of existence—all are illusion. Things take life as their beginning and death as their end, life as the norm and death as change, yet all are obscured within the workings of creation and yin-yang. Therefore, what creation initiates and yin-yang transforms is called life and death. Having exhausted the numbers of creation and yin-yang, and comprehended the changes of qi and form, it is called transformation. When these are bound to numerical change and further altered by form, it is called illusion.

The creator is Heaven. Heaven is spirit, thus its craft is wondrous and unfathomable, its work profound and inexhaustible—hence its difficulty to fully know or comprehend. The shaper is man. Man is discerning, thus his craft is evident and swiftly accomplished, yet shallow and soon undone—hence its rise and fall in an instant.

Life and death are indeed so, while illusion and transformation are contrived. From the perspective of the Dao, none are truly constant. Knowing that illusion and transformation differ not from life and death, where is there anything that is not illusion? Now, you and I are both illusions—yet we study illusion. This is like interpreting a dream within a dream. To speak of things as sometimes existing or ceasing to those who are free in life and death—yet we ourselves remain. Reversing the four seasons, one commands yin and yang without being commanded by them; summoning thunder in winter and creating ice in summer, one governs the seasons without being governed by them; making the flying run and the running fly, one directs the myriad things without being directed by them. With wondrous skill and profound work, one roams with the creator. Yet if one never clings to such arts throughout life, the world will not transmit them, for they are difficult to fully know, fathom, or recognize.

Thus, those who excel in studying illusion establish it upon the constant of non-being, and only then can they exhaust its depths.

Fan said: To use one’s own illusion to invert things, though the root may be upright, is no way to comprehend them. Yet from the perspective of the Dao, even this comprehension is but illusion. Thus, in the faintest stirrings of qi and the division of form from primordial chaos, there is nothing that is not so. What is forged in the furnace and hammer is the beginning of creation; what is set in mechanisms and snares is the transformation of yin. Life and death are named as such, hence they are called life and death. Those who exhaust numbers and comprehend change have not yet transcended the bounds of the unnumbered. Those who alter forms have not yet wholly transformed beyond formlessness. Transformation and illusion are named as such, hence they are called transformation and illusion.

These two—one rooted in creation and attained naturally, thus wondrous, profound, and difficult to fully know or exhaust; the other rooted in form and unable to be without dependence, thus evident, shallow, and rising and falling in an instant. Yet if one truly grasps the Dao, then illusion and transformation differ not from life and death.

Was the automaton crafted by Yan Shi not capable of matching the work of creation? If one understands this principle, then even your body is not your own. Who possesses it? It too is but illusion. To study illusion with illusion—how is this different from interpreting a dream within a dream?

Lao Chengzi returned home and, applying Master Yin Wen’s words, pondered deeply for three months. Thus, he progressed from needing conscious effort to attain understanding. Thereafter, he could freely control life and death without being burdened by things, reverse the four seasons without being bound by numbers, summon thunder in winter and create ice in summer, make the flying run and the running fly, and never cling to such arts throughout his life. How much more so for those who embody the Dao? Wielding supreme authority to act alone, directing the myriad transformations in the unfathomable—there are indeed those who employ it subtly and transform independently, yet how could the world recognize them?

Liezi said: Those who excel in transformation follow a Dao that is subtle and unassuming, their work indistinguishable from others’. They seek only to benefit the world and bring peace to things, thus their achievements remain hidden, and none know of them. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings were not necessarily the result of wisdom or strength alone—some were accomplished through transformation. Who could fathom it?

The achievements and virtue of emperors and kings are named by the world, yet these names are not what make them emperors and kings. Bowing and yielding, halberds and shields—these are but borrowed paths; why should they not also borrow from illusions and transformations? Yet the traces that startle the world are employed subtly by the sage and never displayed.

*On Governance and Harmony*: The virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings—those whose Dao is subtle and unassuming speak of their Dao as hidden in its application. Those whose achievements are like others’ speak of their achievements as manifest in benevolence. The Five Emperors are called "virtuous," the Three Kings "achieving," yet these are but the traces they tread. Their hearts were never not one, yet once they were deemed the result of wisdom and strength, one dared not insist they were accomplished through transformation. Some doubted, so unfathomable was their mastery of transformation. Could this be called flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth?

Fan said: Their Dao is subtle and unassuming—hidden in its application. Their achievements are like others’—manifest in benevolence. This Dao is not easily attained without embodying the spirit and becoming transformation. Yet the Dao is the root; achievements are but its incidental affairs. Thus, though hidden in application—retiring into subtlety—what is usable and visible remains fundamental. Though manifest in benevolence—appearing no different from others—it never fails to equal the formless. If transformation is like this, then even dust, grime, chaff, and husks suffice to mold emperors and kings. Those who rely on wisdom and strength at such times leave only traces of responding to the world—how could this be their means of advancement? The ancients concealed their sharp instruments, never displaying them to others, yet in responding to the myriad changes, they remained serene and untroubled. Truly, this was because of this Dao. Thus, even the hidden depths of ghosts and spirits could not fathom it—how much less the benighted customs of the world? How could they plumb its mysteries?

Awareness has eight signs; dreams have six omens. *Signs* are verifications; *omens* are divinations. The divination of the six dreams is explained in the *Rites of Zhou*. What are the eight signs? The first is *the familiar*—past events. The second is *action*—what one does. The third is *gain*. The fourth is *loss*. The fifth is *sorrow*. The sixth is *joy*. The seventh is *life*. The eighth is *death*. These eight signs are what form engages. What are the six omens? The first is the *ordinary dream*—dreaming in calm repose. The second is the *startled dream*—the *Rites of Zhou* commentary states: *startled* should read as *alarmed*, meaning dreaming from alarm. The third is the *thought dream*—dreaming from reflection, as when Confucius dreamed of the Duke of Zhou. The fourth is the *waking dream*—dreaming while awake from what one has seen, as when Hu Tu dreamed of the crown prince. The fifth is the *joyful dream*—dreaming from happiness. The sixth is the *fearful dream*—dreaming from terror. These six are what the spirit encounters. Their portents can be divined, hence they are called the six omens. This chapter’s main point is also to clarify that awareness and dreams are not different.

Fan said: When King Mu of Zhou’s spirit wandered, it seemed to arrive yet did not; when the elder’s son learned illusions, they seemed real yet were not. Examining their essence, one sees that the myriad distinctions of the world are equal to awareness and dreams. Thus, this passage is followed by the discussion of awareness and dreams. Zhuang Zhou’s *Equalizing Things* chapter expresses the same idea. Therefore, in acting, one engages with affairs; in gain and loss, one differs from things; in sorrow and joy, one’s heart stirs; in life and death, one is bound by fate. These eight are what form engages—their events can be verified, hence they are called the eight signs. Dreaming in peace is the ordinary dream; dreaming from alarm is the startled dream; the thought dream arises from reflection, as when Confucius dreamed of the Duke of Zhou; the waking dream arises from what one sees while awake, as when Hu Tu dreamed of the crown prince; the joyful dream arises from happiness; the fearful dream arises from terror. These six are what the spirit encounters—their omens can be divined, hence they are called the six omens.

Those who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise; those who recognize their origin understand events when they arise. Understanding their origin, there is nothing to fear. All transformations and actions arise from causes. Those who do not seek their root when events have yet to come will inevitably be perplexed. Truly recognizing their origin, even if myriad wonders arise, the heart remains unshaken.

Lu said: With an empty mind and tranquil thoughts, reflecting inward and preserving the spirit, one can penetrate all obstacles and transform all living beings. Yet people only see its application—the traces of transformation—and do not recognize it. Penetration is the root of transformation. Why? Because its Dao is subtly applied and difficult to know, its achievements no different from human affairs. Thus, the Five Emperors and Three Kings are known only for their wisdom and strength, unable to recognize those whose achievements arose from transformation. Yet awareness has eight signs, and dreams have six omens—these are all the traces of living beings. Past events, action, gain, loss, sorrow, joy, life, and death are what form engages; ordinary, startled, thought, waking, joyful, and fearful dreams are what the spirit encounters. What form engages is all deemed awareness; what the spirit encounters is felt as dreams. Though awareness and dreams differ in manifestation, in transformation they are never distinct. Knowing the eight signs and six omens as the constant transformations of the Dao is to recognize their origin. If one knows to guard the spirit without disturbance and that transformations have origins, then what signs or omens could cause alarm?

*On Governance and Harmony*: Awareness engages with affairs, hence it is verified by the eight signs. Dreams conceal principle, hence they are divined by the six omens. What one encounters is called *the familiar*; what one does is called *action*. *Gain* refers to what one acquires; *loss* refers to what one forfeits. Sorrow and joy burden the heart; life and death transform the self. These eight are what form reveals and can be verified, hence it is said: These eight signs are what form engages.

The six states—*uprightness*, *startlement*, *contemplation*, *awakening*, *joy*, and *fear*—are what the ethereal soul intersects and can be divined, hence it is said: These six omens are what the spirit engages. In dreams, the ethereal soul intersects; in wakefulness, form unfolds. The alternation of day and night is transformation. Those who do not recognize the origin of responsive transformation will, when affairs arise, be perplexed by their cause, for they do not know they are dreaming and take themselves to be awake. Those who recognize the origin of responsive transformation will, when affairs arise, know their cause—this is what is called *great awakening* and knowing this to be the *great dream*. One who comprehends the Dao of day and night and knows it perceives the myriad things as one: who is awake, who dreams? What transformation could cause alarm?

Master Fan says: Wakefulness has eight signs, though they are what form engages, yet by their eight signs they are verified, and they are never absent from dreams. Dreams have six omens, though they are what the spirit intersects, yet by their six omens they are divined, and they never begin apart from wakefulness. Thus, the origin of responsive transformation likely arises from some cause. Those who do not recognize its origin will, when affairs arise, be perplexed by their cause. Those who recognize its origin will, when affairs arise, know their cause. Knowing their cause, then life and death too are great matters—one cannot transform with them, let alone the beginnings of profit and harm. What could give rise to distress? The heart is already alarmed, as if alarmed by transformation. The heart has what it loves, then it forgets its worries and grows dim; the heart has what alarms it, then it ponders its troubles and grows clear. Recognizing the origin of responsive transformation, then there is no trouble—what alarm could there be?

The waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this single body all communicate with Heaven and Earth and respond to the classes of things. Humans share qi with yin and yang; the body parallels Heaven and Earth in form. Fortune and misfortune alternate, and cannot but be mutually connected. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters and feels terror, for losing the center of harmony brings drowning and fear. When yang qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great fires and being scorched, for fire’s nature is fierce and violent, and encountering it brings burning. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death, for yin and yang function through harmony; when they contend, they harm each other, bringing either life or death.

When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking. Surplus leads to the desire to bestow; deficiency leads to the desire to seize. This too resembles wakefulness. Thus, those whose illness is *floating emptiness* dream of soaring; those whose illness is *sinking fullness* dream of drowning. Sleeping with a sash beneath one dreams of snakes; if a bird clutches one’s hair, one dreams of flying. These arise from the stimulation of corresponding things. When yin prevails, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep. These are all *lucid dreams*: some arise from affairs stimulating response, some reach extremes and invert, as in the *Rites of Zhou*’s six dreams and six principles—there is no principle without reason.

Master Lu says: When spirit and qi cling to what is fixed, transformation follows; when yin and yang stimulate, dreams change. Some respond after reaching extremes; some appear as likenesses and traces; some manifest reality from causes; some invert principles and do not reveal their nature. If one concentrates the spirit and aligns with the true, obscurely responding to the Dao, then clarity and stillness penetrate transformation, and sorrow and joy cannot enter.

Master Fan says: Form has waxing and waning; qi has ebb and flow. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, this truly communicates with them; though the classes of things are numerous, this truly responds to them. Dreams and wakefulness correspond—how could this be mere coincidence? Thus, what one sees in dreams may be assailed by yin and yang, or stimulated by the transformations of things. Some are the inverse of wakefulness; some resemble affairs—likely they arise from some cause. The ancients divined the fortune of the six dreams by the sun, moon, and stars—was this not for this reason?

Master Liezi says: *Spiritual encounter* is dreaming; *formal engagement* is affairs. *Zhuangzi* says: In sleep, the spirit intersects; in wakefulness, form unfolds. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—what the spirit and form encounter. These thoughts are the affairs of wakeful emotion and concern, not as in ordinary speech. Daytime thoughts of such affairs later follow in dreams. Thus, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. With no emotional concerns by day, there are no dreams by night. True wakefulness does not speak; true dreams are not expressed—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things. To dream of being a bird and soaring in the sky, to dream of being a fish and diving into the depths—these are the reciprocal transformations of emotion. Did the true persons of old truly forget themselves in wakefulness and not dream in sleep? Could it be mere empty words? The true person forgets all comings and goings—how could they sleep, let alone dream? This too is figurative speech to clarify principle.

Master Lu says: When the six emotions are all employed, people take them as real intentions. Those who recognize only the solitary mind take them as illusory—both are like dreams. Those who take dreams as real are like those who call waking real. They do not know that wakefulness too is the spirit’s movement, and dreaming too is the spirit’s activity. To believe one and not the other is to fail to comprehend. If one forgets the self, then there is no dreaming—how could there be another principle?

*On Governance and Harmony*: The world is unified by a single qi. This is why waxing and waning, ebb and flow all communicate with Heaven and Earth and respond to the classes of things. When yin qi is strong, one dreams of great waters and feels terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of great fires and is scorched. When both yin and yang are strong and harmonious, one may dream of life; when both are strong and discordant, one may dream of death. Those whose illness is *floating emptiness* dream of soaring; those whose illness is *sinking fullness* dream of drowning—this is the principle of waxing and waning. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking. When yin prevails, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating—this is the principle of ebb and flow. Sleeping with a sash beneath one dreams of snakes; if a bird clutches one’s hair, one dreams of flying—this arises from correspondence with their kind.

Those who drink wine dream of sorrow; those who sing of love dream of weeping—this is the reversal of their kind. For what the form encounters by day is stored, and thus what the spirit meets arises by night. Hence, what spirit and form undergo are all but the spontaneous workings of waxing and waning, ebb and flow.

As for one who darkly abides in singular truth, ever moving with the Dao/Way, waking and dreaming become one, reality and illusion both forgotten—this is the true person.

Fan [Yizhi] says: In sleep, the hun-souls intermingle, and so encounters become dreams. In waking, the form opens, and so contacts become affairs. Daytime thoughts and nighttime dreams are merely what form and spirit encounter. Yet there must be those whose spirit is concentrated—who penetrate day and night with knowing, who merge dream and waking into a single whole.

Yet when one suddenly awakens from sleep, the transformations of things come and go without the mind ever intervening. Thus one dreams of being a bird and soars to the heavens, dreams of being a fish and plunges into the abyss. Who knows whether Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly dreamed it was Zhou? The myriad learnings transform themselves; transformation knows no joy or sorrow. Who but the supremely awakened can compare to this?

Nevertheless, even if dreams reverse to oneness, there remains deluded perception. When the Dao/Way reaches the true person, in stillness they share virtue/power with yin, in movement they share waves with yang, using truth to darken illusion—truth and illusion become one truth. Waking and dreaming are no longer distinct. This is why their waking is free of delusion, and their sleep is dreamless.

Yet the Huaxu state of the Yellow Emperor is not unattainable—it is merely presented here to clarify the principle. *The Four Explications of the Perfect Dao-Virtue True Classic*, Scroll Seven, concludes.

*The Four Explications of the Perfect Dao-Virtue True Classic*, Scroll Eight.

In the southwestern corner of the Western Limits lay a land unknown where its borders touched, called the State of Ancient Wilderness. Yin and yang’s qi never mingled there, so cold and heat knew no distinction; the light of sun and moon never shone, so day and night knew no division. Its people ate no food, wore no clothes, and slept often, waking but once every fifty days. What they did in dreams they took for real; what they saw awake they deemed illusory.

The lands of the Four Seas—what they called the Central Kingdom—stretch across the north and south of the Yellow River, beyond Mount Tai to the east and west, spanning over ten thousand li. There, yin and yang are measured with precision, so one cold follows one heat; dawn and dusk are clearly divided, so one day follows one night. Its people range from wise to foolish; the ten thousand things flourish and multiply; skills and arts abound in countless forms. There are rulers and subjects in hierarchy, rites and laws to uphold order, and their deeds defy enumeration. Yet they too alternate between waking and sleep, taking what they do awake as real and what they see in dreams as false.

In the northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits lies a land called the State of Flourishing Desolation. Its earth is ever warm, bathed in the lingering glow of sun and moon, yet no fine crops grow there. Its people eat roots and fruits, ignorant of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, prizing victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, ever awake and never sleeping.

Such differences in customs are like the reversal of learning and dreaming, where waking and sleeping diverge in nature—each suited to its own place, none to be faulted. Lu remarks: Thus, though these two lands differ, the spirit that unites them is never distinct. Therefore, we know that the workings of the spirit’s principle are not bound by dreams or waking, food or clothing. If one clings to desires without cease, the heart remains entangled in the mundane.

In the *Zhenghe* commentary: Yang is movement and light; yin is stillness and darkness. The southwestern corner of the Western Limits inclines toward yin, so its people turn toward darkness, still and given to sleep. The northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits inclines toward yang, so its people turn toward light, active and ever awake. The Central Kingdom lies where heaven and earth converge, where the four seasons meet, where wind and rain gather, where yin and yang harmonize. Why should it be bright and active? Why dark and at rest? Movement and stillness do not miss their time; waking and dreaming dissolve into real and illusory. Who but those who embody the true and constant and excel in transformation can attain this?

Fan observes: The rooster is bright by day and dim by night; the owl is dim by day and bright by night—such is the nature of creatures. So too with the people of the southwestern corner of the Western Limits, the northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits, and the Central Kingdom: their customs differ, their waking and dreaming diverge. How can one fathom the reason?

The Lord of Yin in Zhou greatly expanded his estate. His servants toiled from dawn to dusk without respite. An old laborer, his strength spent, was yet driven harder. By day, he groaned as he worked; by night, exhausted, he slept deeply. His spirit scattered and waned, and every night he dreamed he was a lord, ruling over the people, overseeing the affairs of the state, feasting in palaces and towers, indulging every desire—his joy beyond compare. When he woke, he returned to servitude. Someone consoled him for his toil, but the laborer said: “A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave—it is bitter, to be sure—but by night, I am a lord, my joy beyond compare. What cause have I for resentment?”

The Lord of Yin, his heart consumed by worldly affairs and his mind fixed on his family’s wealth, exhausted both body and spirit. By night, he too slept deeply and exhausted. Every night, he dreamed he was a servant, running errands and laboring without cease, enduring every scolding and beating. In his sleep, he muttered and groaned, not resting until dawn. Troubled, the Lord of Yin sought counsel from his friend.

His friend replied: "Your rank suffices to honor your person, your wealth exceeds all needs—you surpass others by far. Yet in dreams you become a servant: such alternations of suffering and ease follow the constant course of things. For prosperity and decline succeed one another, and when joy reaches its height, sorrow arises. Thus what waking finds fair, dreams may find foul. Can one truly possess both waking and dreaming states at once?"

Upon hearing his friend’s words, the Lord of Yin eased the laborer’s tasks and lessened his own cares. His illness then abated somewhat.

This passage also shows that waking and dreaming are not distinct—suffering and joy each find their place. The laborer toils by day yet finds ease by night; the Lord of Yin enjoys honor by day yet suffers humiliation by night. If the principle does not permit both, neither state can claim superiority.

Lu said: "He who wearies the body yet rests the spirit will find waking wearisome but dreams peaceful. He who wearies the spirit yet toils the body will find waking pleasant but dreams bitter. The spirit is the master of life, yet men do not know to nurture the spirit to calm the body. The body is the vessel of the spirit, yet men do not know to sustain the body to ease the spirit. Thus when body and spirit are both exhausted, both exceed their proper measure. If labor and rest are balanced, illness will abate."

Zhenghe said: "The interplay of yin and yang, harmonious and even—this is the form Heaven bestows. When form loses its balance, it becomes biased and gives rise to illness. Some suffer by day yet find joy by night; some find ease by day yet toil by night. Such reversal from beginning to end is the inevitable principle. By easing the laborer’s tasks and reducing his own cares, each attains equilibrium, and so his illness abates.

Yet all things are of one equal nature—who is awake, who dreams? While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; only upon waking does one recognize the dream. But even then, the fool believes himself awake. Only with great awakening does one realize this was the great dream. Was he lord or shepherd? How rigid the distinction!

Fan said: "The Lord of Yin—master of his domain—might be called at ease, yet night after night he dreams of being a servant. The laborer—one who hurries to serve—might be called wretched, yet night after night he dreams of being a lord. Thus suffering and ease alternate, as if some predestined pattern governs the exchange. What the world values is not truly valuable; what the world despises is not truly base. From the perspective of the Dao, things hold no inherent rank—they merely exalt one another as slaves do. Are their servants and concubines not fit to govern one another? Do they not take turns as lord and subject?"

The fool toils by day, yet by night may fancy himself awake, anxiously certain—was he lord or shepherd? How rigid the distinction!

There was a man of Zheng gathering firewood in the wilds when he came upon a startled deer. He pursued it, struck it down, and killed it. Fearing discovery, he hastily concealed it in a ditch and covered it with plantain leaves, overcome with joy. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took the whole affair for a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale aloud. A passerby overheard, followed his words, and took the deer. Returning home, he told his wife, who said: "The woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but did not know where it was. Now you have it—his dream was real indeed." The man replied: "Are you dreaming that the woodcutter caught a deer? Was there ever a woodcutter at all? Now that I truly have the deer, is your dream real?" The wife said: "I hold the deer—what need have I to know whether he dreamed or I dreamed?"

The woodcutter, returning home discontented at his loss, dreamed that night of the very place he had hidden the deer, and of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream, found the deer, and brought suit against the man. The case was taken to the magistrate, who declared: "At first, you truly caught the deer but falsely called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of catching it but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer, and now you dispute it with him. Your wife, meanwhile, claims both dreamed of another’s deer—no one truly has it. Since I now hold this deer, let it be divided between you." He reported this to the Lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: "Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream he divides another’s deer?" He consulted his minister, who replied: "Whether it was dream or waking, your servant cannot discern. To distinguish dream from reality, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could suffice. How do the sages discern dream from waking? Simply by knowing they are not different. Now that the Yellow Emperor and Confucius are gone, who can decide? For the moment, let us trust the magistrate’s words." *Xun* means "to trust." Pronounced *gou*.

Amid joy and anger, one remains deluded, still unable to distinguish the emptiness or reality of waking and dreaming—how much less when waking and dreaming are fundamentally nonexistent? Lu said: Those who take it as a dream merely grasp at delusion. When the spirit’s perception is unclear, it becomes a false dream. The one who overheard and took the deer was likewise unclear—this too was a dream. The one who obtained the deer then dreamed of seeking it, bringing the matter before the magistrate: all were unclear, their deluded feelings the same. Thus, it was divided between them. Could any but the sage see through such delusion? Yet in an age without sages, affairs lack certainty, so the magistrate, unable to resolve what was unresolved, only added further delusion.

*Zhenghe* observes: From the Dao’s perspective, who is awake and who dreams? Right and wrong are but a single qi. Is there truly any distinction? With the rise of penal codes and names, truth and falsehood emerge. Thus, one truly obtains a deer, yet it is falsely called a dream. One truly dreams of shelter, yet it is falsely called real. The paths of right and wrong tangle and clash—how can their distinctions be known? The Yellow Emperor and Confucius, merging truth with delusion, truly had no "this" or "that." The magistrate’s words, using truth to discern delusion—truly had no "this" or "that." Thus, seeking verification from the Yellow Emperor or Confucius yields nothing, and so trusting the magistrate’s words suffices.

Fan said: One who embodies the Dao perceives solitude and embraces stillness, where gain and loss cannot burden the heart. The deer, a creature fond of herds, is not solitary. Swift of foot, it does not embrace stillness. Thus, one gathers firewood in the wild, obtains it, then suddenly loses it—concluding it was a dream. Another hears of it and takes it, then suddenly obtains it—likewise deeming the other’s account a true dream. Upon returning to tell his household, he too calls it a dream of another’s deer. Then who knows the reason for the deer’s gain or loss, the dream’s emptiness or reality? "This" and "that" attack each other, giving rise to deluded distinctions and the seeds of strife. Within the dream, one dreams of interpreting the dream—again dreaming of dividing another’s deer. How could one know this is the great dream? Only with a true person comes true knowledge. Thus, only the Yellow Emperor and Confucius could distinguish waking from dreaming. The magistrate acts to govern affairs; the minister of state discourses on the Dao.

In Song, in Yangli, there was a man named Hua Zi who, in middle age, suffered from forgetfulness. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he gave at night he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He did not recognize what came before, nor what came after. His entire household was distressed. They consulted a diviner and sought a prognostication, but none was given...

They sought a shaman to pray for him, but the malady remained; they consulted a physician to treat him, yet it persisted. In Lu there was a Confucian scholar who offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. His wife and children offered half their household property in exchange for the remedy. The scholar said: "This is certainly not a matter for divination by hexagrams or omens. For the subtle workings arise there, while the oracle bones respond here—thus good and ill fortune may be inferred from hexagrams, and hidden truths traced through images and numbers. But now, the forgetful mind is as still as cold ashes, as vast and empty as an abandoned mansion. The sage would dance before its mirror—how could hexagrams or omens reveal it? Nor is it a matter for prayer and supplication. For trust and obedience may invoke blessings, and upright sincerity may dispel deceit and falsehood—this is the natural course of things. Thus those who betray their conscience before the gods or incur resentment in human affairs all bring ruin upon themselves through such means. But when the emotions are free of obsession and conduct free of madness, then it is not a matter for prayer and supplication. Nor is it a condition for acupuncture or medicine. When illness lodges in the organs or disperses through the flesh, one must examine the pulses to discern excess and deficiency, and administer medicine or stone needles to attack the affliction. Yet if the heart is not disordered by desires, nor the body harmed by cold or heat, then the physician’s art is rightly set aside.

I shall attempt to transform his mind and alter his thoughts—perhaps he may yet be cured. But if forgetfulness utterly lacks thought or concern, what is there to transform? This principle seems to suggest that it is easy to restore a mind where none exists, to restore thoughts where none remain—though the words may appear contradictory. Thus, I tested him: I exposed him to the cold, and he sought clothing; I starved him, and he sought food; I plunged him into darkness, and he sought light. First, I took away what he relied upon to provoke a response. The scholar joyfully told his son: 'The illness can be cured.' Yet my method is secret, passed down through generations and not disclosed to others. I asked that all attendants be dismissed, and that I remain alone with him in his chamber for seven days. They complied. None knew what he did."

The scholar’s methods were manifold, not confined to a single path of verification. Yet an illness of many years was dispelled in a single morning. The preceding lines speak of how shamans, physicians, and all arts of calculation had exhausted their thoughts, yet the scholar alone, by addressing what ailed him, first drew Hua Zi’s forgetfulness into alignment with the natural, illuminating the extremity of no-mind—a state not to be regained through mere techniques or repeated inference. The scholar’s achievement surpassed that of historians and shamans; when principle is not obscured, myriad methods may be employed to guide. He further sought to awaken the forgetful one to the realization that his former oblivion had nearly touched the ultimate truth.

Lu said: *"The* Laozi *states: 'In the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates; in the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes. Diminish and diminish again, until one reaches non-action.' Hua Zi studied the Dao and forgot his own existence; the scholar studied existence to augment his knowledge. To augment knowledge is to distinguish right and wrong before one’s eyes; to forget existence is to remain untouched by gain or loss in the celestial storehouse. How could divination or medicine cure such a state?"*

Thus, the scholar used manifold means to lure his mind, entangling his thoughts in right and wrong. Hua Zi thereby lost the Dao and afterward virtue; having lost virtue, right and wrong clashed within his breast, and the Way of sitting in forgetfulness was lost. Hua Zi, now awakened, flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his son, and brandished a spear to chase the scholar away. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua Zi said: *"Before, I was forgetful—vast and boundless, unaware of the existence or nonexistence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly recalling the past, decades of survival and loss, sorrow and joy, likes and dislikes—ten thousand threads of disturbance arise within me. I fear that future survival and loss, sorrow and joy, likes and dislikes will disorder my heart like this. Can I ever recover even a moment’s forgetfulness?"*

If even an illness resembling the ultimate truth could provoke such a response, how much more so when embodying its extremity?

Lu said: *"Hua Zi longed to return to the real but found no way, so he raged at his wife and son and drove out the scholar."*

Zi Gong heard of this and found it strange, reporting it to Confucius. Confucius said: *"This is not something within your grasp."* Then, turning to Yan Hui, he said: *"Record this."* This principle should indeed be within Ci’s reach; the reason for deflecting him was to entrust the subtle appreciation to a greater worthy.

Lu said: *"Zi Gong was a scholar of disputation, eager for advancement and diligent in learning—hence the words 'This is not within your grasp.' Yan Hui, who loved learning and was second only to the sage, never deviated from benevolence—thus he was instructed to record it, to make the Dao manifest to the great worthy."*

Zhenghe said: *"To know forgetfulness is the harmony of the mind of right and wrong. Cast aside the limbs and depart from form; dismiss cleverness and abandon knowledge. The celestial mechanism does not unfold; silently, one accords with the Dao. Dim and seemingly absent, yet present in the world—how could it be perceived? The common people are bright; I alone am as if benighted. The plain and unadorned scorn the root of established affairs, while knowledge penetrates the divine—this is why the sage does not fall ill. Yet the world deems ignorance an illness, calling Hua Zi’s state 'forgetful sickness.' Then they sought to transform his heart and alter his thoughts, causing survival and loss, sorrow and joy, likes and dislikes—ten thousand threads of disturbance—to arise and burden his form. By disturbing his heart, the scholar claimed to cure his illness. Yet to open a man’s mind and harm his life, and for Confucius not to speak of it to Zi Gong—because of its multiplicity and confusion—while instructing Yan Hui to record it, was due to his ability to sit in forgetfulness."*

Fan said: *"Song is where fire resides, and brightness follows; yang is by nature ever-floating and active. Within, it dwells but is not profound; like a flower, it blooms yet detaches from the root. The 'son' is but an infant, yet by middle age, one has already deeply immersed in human artifice. The illness of forgetfulness is a return to nature. A fleeting restoration of heaven—yet it is called an illness, revealing the world’s desires as the true sickness, not one of delusion without recovery. The ancients, in speaking of attaining the Dao, necessarily prized the forgetting of the heart. Was not Song Zi’s illness close to the forgetting of the heart, and thus to the attainment of the Dao’s reality? In reality, one attains unity. Taking in the morning and forgetting by evening—forgetting in the morning; giving in the evening and forgetting by dawn—forgetting in the evening. On the road, one forgets walking—forgetting on the road; in the chamber, one forgets sitting—forgetting in the chamber. Not recognizing the past—forgetting in the present; not recognizing the present—forgetting in the future. First, forgetting taking and giving—forgetting things; then, forgetting walking and sitting—forgetting place; finally, forgetting past and future—forgetting time. Yet how could this be considered an illness? Having called it an illness, there must be one who suffers it—yet if it is called 'forgetting,' who then suffers it? Not knowing that he was never ill, the household poisoned him; when poisoning failed, they consulted historians and divined; when divination failed, they consulted shamans and prayed; when prayer failed, they consulted physicians and attacked. None of the three could apply their arts, and then a Ru from Lu followed behind, self-promoting his ability to cure. Lu is a land of culture and refinement; Ru are the descendants of benevolence and righteousness. The great unity was thus sundered. Yet if he himself had no doubts, then fortune and misfortune could not be known—what use were the hexagrams? If he himself had no faults, then ghosts and spirits could not fathom him—what use were prayers? If he himself had no illness, then yin and yang could not invade him—what use were medicines? Desiring to cure his forgetfulness, they tested his heart and altered his thoughts, hoping he might yet be healed. Thus, they exposed him to the elements, making him aware of cold; starved him, making him aware of hunger; plunged him into darkness, making him aware of light. The heart, not being singular, became paired with things. Aware of cold, he sought clothing; aware of hunger, he sought food; aware of darkness, he sought light—perception was no longer solitary, and the heart had an opposite."*

When they chiseled for seven days, the seven apertures of Chaos opened at once; when they swept it away in a single morning, the ten thousand forms of the world arose all together.

In great fury he banished his wife and children, for they were close to him, and thus his reproach ran deep. Grasping his halberd he drove out the scholars, for they made demands of him, and thus his resentment cut keen.

Loss and gain, sorrow and joy, love and hate—once, each had been unknown to him; now, they ceaselessly swarmed within. How could even a moment’s forgetfulness be attained?

Zigong questioned Confucius in astonishment, for he was submerged in the disputations of broad learning. Confucius turned to Yan Hui and recorded it, for he had attained the marvel of sitting-in-forgetfulness. Yet was Huazi’s forgetfulness truly forgetfulness? His affliction was to forget in darkness, and upon awakening, to rage in sudden fury—he had not yet forgotten both and been transformed by the Dao.

Among the Feng clan of Qin there was a son who in youth was clever, but in manhood suffered from delusion. Cleverness is not delusion, yet the flaw of using cleverness must lead to delusion. He heard singing and took it for weeping; saw white and took it for black; smelled fragrance and took it for rot. The *Monthly Ordinances* says: its scent is rot. He tasted sweetness and took it for bitterness; took wrong for right. Wherever his mind wandered—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not inverted.

Lu said: He who prides himself on petty cleverness is deemed wise by others. He who embodies the Dao and preserves harmony is deemed foolish. One who equalizes sound and color, who treats water and fire as illusions—such distinctions lie beyond the discernment of common folk. Thus they take the Dao for delusion.

Yang’s family told his father: “The gentlemen of Lu abound in arts and skills—might they cure him? Why not seek them out?” His father traveled to Lu, but passing through Chen, he encountered Lao Dan and recounted his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: “How do you know your son is the deluded one? Today, all under heaven are bewildered by right and wrong, benighted by profit and harm. Those sharing his affliction are many, yet none awaken. Moreover, the delusion of one man is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of one household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of one village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of one state is not enough to overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded, who then could overturn it? Were all under heaven like your son, *you* would be the deluded one.

Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can set them aright? Even my words here may not be free of delusion, let alone the gentlemen of Lu, those couriers of confusion. The gentlemen of Lu extol benevolence and righteousness, proclaiming right and wrong with clarity—hence they are couriers of confusion. How could they resolve another’s delusion? Gather your provisions and return home. To ‘gather’ is to abandon.”

This passage clarifies that the principles of right and wrong cannot be wholly fixed, for all disputes arise from the many overwhelming the few. Lu said: “To gather is to abandon.” The world teems with vulgar scholars; those who awaken to the Dao are few. The multitude, lost in delusion, scorn the solitary wise as deluded. Thus the *Laozi* says: “When lesser men hear the Dao, they laugh aloud—were they not to laugh, it would not be the Dao.” To seek the scholars of Zhao Jing to rectify right and wrong is to stray ever farther from the Dao.

The Confucians of Lu, far from the Way of forgetting form and preserving spirit, are themselves profoundly deluded. How could they enlighten another’s confusion? Better to abandon your provisions and hasten home.

In the *Zhenghe* edition: The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. That side has its right and wrong, this side has its right and wrong—so too with the sounds of singing and weeping, the colors of black and white, the scents of fragrance and rot, the tastes of sweet and bitter. Within the four seas, each man affirms what he affirms and denies what he denies. Who then shall set them right? The people’s delusion...

The delusion has endured for long indeed. Those who whisper knowingly call *them* deluded—yet how could I claim to know their distinctions? This is why Laozi said to his father, “How could you presume to know your son’s delusion?” And again: “Grief and joy, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can set them right?” The Dark Pearl was lost, and only Image-Net retrieved it. Yet the affliction of delusion and confusion—how could the world recognize it?

Fan said: Benevolence is the human heart. To act from the heart is what is called wisdom. To be wise from youth is merely to open to heaven. But when one reaches maturity and contracts the affliction of delusion and confusion, then knowledge becomes useless, and one drifts ever farther from the boundless Dao. In the northern lands, winter is called *wang*. *Wang* means the convergence of being. To be deluded to the point of *wang*—is this not nearly to reach the utter void, becoming the very source to which the myriad beings turn? Yet it is called an affliction because the world takes it as such.

To hear singing and mistake it for weeping is not to be without sound, but merely to fail to distinguish sounds. To see a white procession and call it black is not to be without color, but merely to fail to discern colors. To savor fragrance as rot is to approach the absence of scent. To taste sweetness as bitterness is to approach the absence of flavor. To take wrong for right is to arrive at the bounded Dao, where right and wrong have never yet arisen. At its root, wherever the mind turns—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all are inverted. Is this not the state where the ten thousand things merge, utterly without distinction?

Yang told his father that the gentlemen of Lu prized many arts and skills, for they personally practiced benevolence and righteousness, clearly distinguishing right and wrong, thus dissecting the undivided wholeness of the Dao. His father, traveling to Lu, passed through Chen and encountered Laozi, to whom he recounted his son’s obstinacy. For Laozi’s way was rooted in profundity, ordered by simplicity, and embodied the vastness of the Dao.

At that time, the people of the world were bewildered by right and wrong, benighted by profit and harm. Those sharing the same affliction were many, yet none awakened. Who, then, was deluded? Who was not? From oneself to one’s family, from family to village, from village to state, from state to the world—none were not wholly deluded. Who could overturn this? Had the hearts of all under heaven been like your son’s, then *you* would have been the deluded one.

Moreover, grief and joy, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—these incline and contend, yet who can determine which is correct? Who could I appoint to set them right, aligning them with me or with you? If they were aligned with me or with you, how could they then be set right to differ from me or from you? And if they were set to differ from me or from you, how could they be set right to avoid becoming the very messengers of delusion?

To seek to dispel another’s delusion only deepens the confusion, turning back upon your own nature and spirit, leaving no path to enter. Thus, abandon your provisions and hasten home. Laozi would surely say: “My words are not necessarily free of delusion—only I wish to cast off the burden of speech.”

A man of Yan was born in Yan and grew up in Chu. In old age, he returned to his homeland. Passing through the state of Jin, his traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying, “This is the city of Yan.” The man’s expression turned somber. They pointed to a shrine and said, “This is the village shrine of your homeland.” He sighed deeply. They pointed to a house and said, “This is your ancestors’ dwelling.” He wept silently. They pointed to a mound and said, “This is your ancestors’ grave.” He could not restrain his sobs. The companions burst into laughter, saying, “We were only teasing you—this is Jin!” The man was overcome with shame.

When he finally reached Yan and truly saw the city and shrines of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and graves, his sorrow was far less keen. This passage shows that emotions rise to a peak, but once grief and joy have passed, what once moved him now evoked no joy or sorrow.

Lu said: Human nature is fundamentally similar, but habits drive people far apart—each follows what their emotions and customs find familiar. Born in Yan, one does not depart from one’s roots. Raised in Chu, one grows accustomed to what one knows. Returning to one’s roots yet failing to recognize them, one is easily swayed by superficial resemblances. When deceived by what *seems* familiar, confusion arises. Realizing the deception, one feels shame, forgetting one’s emotions. Even upon seeing the truth, one still regards it as insubstantial. Thus, nothing is truly understood, and one’s emotions are swayed by others.

How much more so for the gentlemen of today, who cling to the cities and shrines of Jin as if they were real—how could they know the supreme Dao of nurturing the spirit and returning to the root?

Fan said: The realm of inherent nature spans the ages unchanged. Yet those who chase things and forget to return are many, drifting recklessly along the path of ceaseless change. Even those who seek to restore their nature through vulgar learning only deepen their confusion, mistaking things for themselves. Is this not because they know not where their true dwelling lies?

The man of Yan, born in Yan and raised in Chu, had chased things and lost the condition of his nature. In old age, returning to his homeland, he sought to restore his nature and recover his original state. Passing through Jin, his companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying, “This is the city of Yan,” and his expression turned somber. Pointing to a shrine and saying, “This is the shrine of Yan,” he sighed deeply. Pointing to a house and saying, “This is your ancestors’ dwelling,” he wept silently. Pointing to a mound and saying, “This is your ancestors’ grave,” he could not restrain his sobs. Then, when told, “This is Jin,” he was overcome with shame—this was the condition of profound confusion, of mistaking things for oneself and failing to return to one’s true dwelling.

When he finally reached Yan and truly saw the city and shrines of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and graves, his sorrow was far less keen.

The gain and loss here may be what is meant by "entering and only then finding joy." This person, though said to have been deluded before returning, is fundamentally different from those who exhaust themselves in toil without knowing where to return. The *Xu Wugui* speaks of the man from Yue, and Zhuang Zhou offers the parable of the old capital—both align with this meaning.

Confucius was a wise man who knew without being taught. Forgetting knowledge, he had nothing to know; employing knowledge, he had nothing to accomplish. Grasping the essence of spirit and moving alone, forgetting emotions and following principle, he was one who abided in serene and mysterious illumination.

Lu said: This chapter speaks of those who realize the Dao of non-action, who may then act without limitation. Worldly people see only the traces of the sage but do not know the root of what he has realized. Scholars merely grasp the beginning of transcending emotions but do not understand its application in saving all things—both miss the mean.

Zhenghe said: When acted upon, it is full; when left alone, it is empty. Observing subtleties in tandem, neither being nor non-being is obscured. Nothing is not forgotten, nothing is not possessed. In profound tranquility without limit, this is called uniting with principle.

Fan said: Only by forgetting knowledge can one refrain from using it; only by attaining the spirit can one avoid being named a sage. Such a one, turning inward in contemplation, finds right and wrong, profit and harm do not enter his breast. Thus, his eyes are like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all are the same. What is within me is like this. Looking outward, praise and blame, sorrow and joy do not disturb his mind. Thus, he sees life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and himself as one among them. What belongs to things is like this. Though his strength may subdue the world, he does not rely on it; though his eloquence may carve all things, he does not delight in it. True knowledge and true ability are found within oneself—this is what is meant by "non-action yet nothing left undone."

Confucius was at leisure when Zigong entered to attend him, bearing the weight of fame.

Zhenghe said: The sage retreats and hides in secrecy, thus his heart does not cling to joy or misfortune. Sharing the people’s concerns, he has sorrow.

Zigong did not dare ask. Though Zigong had not reached the level of nature and the Dao of Heaven, he had thoroughly heard the Master’s teachings. The sage’s freedom from sorrow was beyond the reach of common understanding—how much more so for Zigong? He did not dare ask because the elucidation of the profound principle would only arise after elevating one to the level of a great worthy, and only then could subtle words be proclaimed.

He went out and told Yan Hui, who took up his zither and sang. When Confucius heard this, he summoned Yan Hui to enter and asked, "Why are you alone in joy?"

Hui said, "Why is the Master alone in sorrow?"

Hui did not speak his intended question but used the zither and song to provoke the Master’s words.

Confucius said, "First, speak your own mind."

Hui said, "I once heard the Master say, 'Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus there is no sorrow'—this is why I am joyful. Heaven is the portion of nature; fate is the reckoning of success and failure."

Zhenghe said: Rejoicing in Heaven means not blaming others; knowing fate means not overrelying on effort. Following nature, the heart is not burdened—how could there be sorrow?

Confucius, his expression turning solemn, asked, "Did I truly say this? I will clarify that these words were incomplete." He showed a questioning demeanor to reveal the inadequacy of the statement. "Your understanding is mistaken. Those were my words of the past; let my words of today be taken as correct. The words of the past arose from circumstances; what I now clarify reaches their ultimate meaning."

Zhenghe said: Where does the Dao not go and yet not abide? What words abide and yet cannot be spoken? Adapting to the times is called "right"; embodying the constancy of the Dao is called "correct." Thus, the words of the past could be considered right, but from today’s perspective, they cannot be considered correct. Yet taking the past words as right and today’s words as correct, what is spoken remains unsettled. Knowing that the times have no fixed standard, how can those bound by teachings speak of this?

"You merely know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate bring no sorrow, but you do not know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate entail great sorrow. Knowing nothing that is not known, delighting in nothing that is not delightful, sorrowing in nothing that is not sorrowful—this is what is called 'great.'"

Zhenghe said: True joy is without joy, yet nothing is not joyful; true knowledge is without knowledge, yet nothing is not known. Cultivating it in oneself, there is no sorrow; cultivating it in the world, there is great sorrow.

Fan said: "Retiring from court" is called "leisurely dwelling"; "leisure" is called "at ease." Thus, there is "leisurely dwelling" and "dwelling at ease." Zigong’s learning grasped the words but not their underlying meaning. The Master’s teachings could be heard, but his words on nature and the Dao of Heaven could not be heard. Thus, regarding the sage’s sorrow, he dared not ask. Yan Hui’s learning was comprehensive yet subtle, attaining form and awakening—not truly foolish. "All day without opposition" was not to assist me; there was nothing not delightful. Thus, hearing the sage’s sorrow, he took up his zither and sang, intending to provoke something. This is why Confucius, upon hearing it, summoned him, and Hui entered with the question of "alone in joy."

The one who embodies the Dao is always joyful; the one who engages with affairs is always sorrowful. Heaven is what acts without acting—I rejoice in it and do not refuse. Fate is what gives rise to nature; thus, I know it without obstruction. Rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate, I set all things in motion yet do not share the sage’s sorrow. Looking down upon the world, all things arise, yet none burden my heart—this is why Hui is joyful. Yet this is only so much; it is not the ultimate.

Thus, Confucius took this as the words of the past.

Speech has no constant rightness; responding to the moment makes it correct. What was right in the past may now be deemed wrong; what was permissible then may now be rejected. You merely know that "rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate" brings no sorrow, yet you do not grasp its great sorrow—this is why you cannot take present words as correct.

Viewed thus, the *Liezi* may be said to delve deeper than the *Yi*. Wang Tong said: "All under Heaven are sorrowful; I alone attain freedom from sorrow." How could he have understood the sage’s intent? Now I tell you the truth: cultivating the self, accepting poverty or prosperity, knowing that going and coming are not of the self, and banishing disorder from the heart’s reckoning—this is what you call "rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate" without sorrow. This merely distinguishes the boundaries of inner and outer, discerns the realms of honor and disgrace, and no more. How could it attain the state of "no right, no wrong"?

Lu said: "To rejoice in Heaven, to know fate, and to be free from sorrow—this is the way of timely success, not the task of responding to things and saving the world."

Confucius said: "I once held these words, but now they differ from the past."

*Zhenghe* states: Those who understood the Dao in ancient times knew that action and stillness were not within human power but lay with Heaven, that rise and fall were not governed by effort but by fate. They neither rejoiced in success nor felt shame in failure, adapting to what came and went. To "adapt" is to follow. Abiding in the moment and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy could not enter—what sorrow could there be? Yet this is only the cultivation of the self.

Formerly, I studied the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern all under Heaven and bequeath them to later ages. The *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music are the instruments of governing the world. The sage employed them to remedy the ills of the time, but when their use strays from the Dao, they offer no benefit to order. It was not merely to cultivate the self or govern the state of Lu. The sage comprehends all things and saves the world through the Dao. To secure the self and rescue one state is not what makes a sage. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order; benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature grew ever more shallow. If the Dao does not prevail in one state or in this generation, what of all under Heaven and future ages?

The arts of governing the world truly require benevolence and righteousness. Once the world is ordered, the arts employed should be set aside. If, when all affairs are concluded, one clings to them without letting go, those who follow the truth will be few, while those who seek profit will be many. The beginning of decline and shallowness truly lies here. Observing all under Heaven through one state, and future ages through the present, are the ills of governance not the same?

Only one who is perfectly adaptable and unobstructed can follow change as it arises, not lingering in one place. I once knew that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know how to reform them—this is the sorrow of those who "rejoice in Heaven and know fate." Only by discarding the misuse of rites and music, not their proper use, can rites and music not be abandoned. Thus, I said I did not know how to reform them. Yet raising this as a sorrow lays the groundwork for what follows, which is why I spoke thus first.

Lu said: The *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music are not insufficient as the methods for governing all under Heaven, yet the theories of the world cannot be saved by the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music alone. If one discards these methods, there will be nothing left as the foundation of order. This is the profound sorrow of those who possess the Dao.

*Zhenghe* states: The *Odes* and *Documents* record the words of governance; rites and music are the instruments of governance. Confucius embodied the true Dao to cultivate himself, transcending form, color, fame, and reputation, yet he pitied the world’s ills. Thus, he spoke of benevolence and righteousness, clarified rites and music, and employed every means to console the hearts of all under Heaven. Yet the people of the world, losing their essence and drowning their minds, had no way to return to their nature and restore their original state. Benevolence and righteousness further declined, human nature grew more shallow, and the Dao did not prevail in that generation. Considering the world and later ages, this is the cause for sorrow.

Nevertheless, I have grasped it: those who "rejoice without joy" and "know without knowledge" do not refer to what the ancients called joy and knowledge. *Zhuangzi* said: "To rejoice in poverty or success, in things—this is not the sage." Thus, the ancients did not take the absence of joy as joy, nor the absence of knowledge as knowledge. Following what they rejoiced in, principle naturally has no joy; following what they knew, principle naturally has no knowledge. Without joy and without knowledge—this is true joy and true knowledge. To be entirely without joy and without knowledge is to be able to rejoice in the world’s joys, know the world’s knowledge, yet remain without self-interest. Thus, there is nothing not rejoiced in, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowed over, nothing not done. Abiding in the root and embodying completeness, one can act without acting and yet do all things.

What is there to discard in the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music? What is there to reform? If one seeks to diminish the *Odes* and *Documents* and alter the arts of governance, is this the way to remedy ills? Employ them without clinging, act without reliance, and things will be preserved of themselves.

Lu said: To know what Heaven’s decree allows no alternative and to accept one’s lot without sorrow—this is the constant heart of the noble person. Yet those in ancient times who opened things and accomplished tasks, who benefited people and improved customs, did not rest in their joy or rely on their knowledge. They preceded Heaven without opposing it, followed Heaven without defying its time—this is true joy and true knowledge. Being thus, there is nothing not rejoiced in, nothing not known, and thus nothing not done. How could they merely entrust themselves to it? Therefore, the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music are indeed the foundation for assisting transformation. What is there to reform?

Yan Hui faced north, bowed, and said: "I too have grasped it." This is what is meant by "not opposing yet seeming foolish."

He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was bewildered and lost, unable to fully align with the ultimate words, and thus fell into confusion. Returning home, he pondered deeply for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out.

Fired with determination to seek the Dao, he forgot sleep and food. Yan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon Zigong returned to Confucius’ gate, strumming the zither and reciting the texts, never ceasing for the rest of his life. Once he had awakened to the ultimate principle, all other matters were forgotten.

Lu said: Yan Hui, in following the Way of the sublimely sagely, heard and grasped it. Zigong relied on the *Odes* and *Documents* for his wisdom, and thus when he heard the words, he lost what he had taken as fundamental.

Yan Hui enlightened him again, and he came to realize the benefit of learning, yet did not understand the Way of daily diminution.

*Zhenghe* says: If the Dao and its virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness? If one’s nature and emotions are not estranged, why employ rites and music? Those who "rejoice in Heaven" rejoice in something—this is not the joy of the ancients. Those who "know fate" know something—this is not the knowledge of the ancients. One who rejoices in Heaven must ultimately reach a state of nothing to rejoice in—this is true joy. One who knows fate must ultimately reach a state of nothing to know—this is true knowledge. Being thus, there is nothing not rejoiced in, nothing not known, nothing not worried over, nothing not done, and one becomes a person in harmony with transformation. If one goes forth yet cannot transform, then governing with the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music may suffice. Retreating from benevolence and righteousness, discarding rites and music, may also suffice. Thus, in the beginning, the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder. Yet once one has attained the Way, one asks: How could the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music be abandoned? Why reform them?

Zigong had not dared to ask before, but upon hearing this, he was bewildered and lost, his thoughts yielding nothing, so he merely recited the texts without ceasing. Was this not what is meant by "grasping the words but not their underlying meaning"?

Fan said: The true Dao governs the self, and thus cultivates the person. It neither exults in success nor feels shame in poverty, and thus embraces both prosperity and adversity. Coming, one accepts it; going, one follows it—thus knowing that going and coming are not of the self. Not seeking eminence, one indulges the will without constraint; in poverty and hardship, one follows custom—thus banishing disorder from the heart and thoughts. This is what is meant by "rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow," and it is indeed found here.

Yet if even one general cannot be obtained to startle the world, then one must rely on remnants to govern the state and worthless chaff to order the realm. How can one who takes the hearts of the people as one’s own heart remain indifferent and without sorrow? Thus, the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music are the traces left by the former kings—tools for governance, not the Way of governance. Does one cultivate the *Odes* and *Documents* to govern? Yet benevolence and righteousness grow ever weaker. Does one rectify rites and music to govern? Yet human nature and emotions grow ever more shallow. If the Dao does not prevail in one state, what will become of the world? If the Dao does not prevail in the present age, what will become of future generations? I know that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music cannot save the world from disorder, yet I do not know how to reform them. This is why those who "rejoice in Heaven and know fate" seem to bear so many sorrows.

Nevertheless, I have grasped it: "Rejoicing in Heaven" is not the joy of the ancients—true joy is joy without joy, allowing whatever brings joy, and thus there is nothing not rejoiced in. "Knowing fate" is not the knowledge of the ancients—true knowledge is knowledge without knowledge, allowing whatever is known, and thus there is nothing not known. Being thus, though there may be daily sorrows, how could these be the anxieties of those who fret over the world’s ills? Thus, one can act without acting yet accomplish everything.

As for the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music of old: one may use them without necessarily abandoning them, follow them without necessarily reforming them. Accord with things as they are, without imposing private intentions. Who could exhaust themselves in taking the world and future generations as their concern?

Yan Hui had attained the subtlety of "sitting in forgetfulness," and thus, upon hearing the sage’s words, he gained insight. Zigong was submerged in the disputations of broad learning, and thus he was merely bewildered and lost.

A minister from Chen visited Lu and had a private audience with the head of the Shu Sun clan. The latter said: "There is a sage in our state." The minister asked: "Is it not Kong Qiu?" "It is," he replied. "How do you know he is a sage?" "This is a profound question. The Way of the sage transcends the bounds of common understanding, beyond the reach of all things, yet one glimpses traces of its convergence and penetration—hence one calls him a sage. How could one truly know what makes him sagely?"

The head of the Shu Sun clan said: "I have often heard of him from Yan Hui." "This is a profound answer. If one has not embodied both aspects and taken form, how could one speak of his likeness or glimpse his precedence? Even with Yan Hui’s capacity, he could not fully describe him—how much less those beneath him?"

The minister said: "Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body." These were Yan Hui’s words. The sage neither sets aside nor employs anything—such terms arise only in response to circumstances. Thus, bending and rising to myriad affairs, engaging with worldly matters, are all matters of the body’s advance. One who is profoundly detached and still as cold ashes is indeed serene and unmoving.

Lu said: The sage responds to things and arises, aiding the times and guiding the multitude of beings, manifesting traces to reveal the truth and transform the ordinary.

The minister from Chen said: "There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?" "Who is this sage?" "Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kǎng Cāngzǐ (also pronounced Gēng), who attained Lao Dan’s Dao. Lao Dan himself did not speak of attaining the Dao—how could Kǎng Cāng have attained it? This is merely a borrowed name to show that the ultimate principle is never severed from the principles of things. He could see with his ears and hear with his eyes."

The bodily form is the dwelling of the mind and intelligence; the ears and eyes are the windows and doors of seeing and hearing. If the spirit is thoroughly permeating, then seeing and hearing do not depend on windows and doors, and illumination is not obstructed by walls.

*Zhenghe* says: Confucius responded to things while forgetting the mind, and thus those who saw his sageliness thought he could set aside the mind and employ the body. Kǎng Cāngzǐ accorded with himself while forgetting the body, and thus those who saw his sageliness thought he could see with his ears and hear with his eyes. Setting aside the mind and employing the body is like the seesaw’s rise and fall.

What draws people is also drawn by them. Seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes shares the same meaning as Liezi’s "mind congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly dissolved." Yet what is set aside and what is employed? The Dao of the sage is without seeing and without hearing—how could it be subject to inquiry? This is merely how ordinary people perceive it.

Fan says: The mind is the master of the body, and the body is what the mind unites with. Only by controlling the mind can one set it aside, thus avoiding its burdens. Only by employing the form can one use it, thus avoiding its servitude. The sage’s sageliness lies in neither setting aside nor employing anything.

The hearing of Master Shusun was like this, and thus he praised Confucius in this way. The ears govern hearing, the eyes govern seeing. When essence is whole and unharmed, the ears become penetrating—then one may see. When spirit is employed yet inexhaustible, the eyes become penetrating—then one may hear. The sage’s sageliness lies in seeing without eyes and hearing without ears. The observation of Minister Chen was like this, and thus he praised Kǎng Cāngzǐ in this way.

The Duke of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished—not at Confucius’ employment of the body, but at the interchange of ears and eyes’ functions. His traces were the same as other things, so nothing startled his mind. He sent his highest minister with rich gifts to summon him. Kǎng Cāngzǐ accepted the invitation and arrived.

One who is utterly without intent finds nothing in the four directions that is not oneself. The Duke of Lu humbled his words and entreated him for instruction. Kǎng Cāngzǐ said: Those who transmit this speak falsely. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the functions of ears and eyes. To alter their functions is not yet to be entirely without use. To be entirely without use would mean the instruments one relies upon are discarded.

Lu says: The ears and eyes are the instruments of seeing and hearing. Only spirit can employ them. If spirit is not present, even a corpse’s ears and eyes cannot see or hear. Kǎng Cāngzǐ understood what people are capable of, and thus did not use ears and eyes as the masters of seeing and hearing. Was he commanding the ears to see and the eyes to hear? This is merely how transmitters, not understanding, fabricated the account.

The Duke of Lu said: This is even more extraordinary—what is its principle? I still wish to hear it.

Lu says: The Duke of Lu still did not grasp this meaning and instead took it as an even greater marvel. He persistently requested its principle.

Kǎng Cāngzǐ said: My body unites with the mind—this is form and intelligence not opposing each other. The mind unites with qi—this is further distancing the employment of form and intelligence, entrusting it to the tranquil qi. Qi unites with spirit—this is stillness without movement, wholly forgetting intelligence. When intelligence is wholly forgotten, the workings of spirit alone respond without obstruction. Spirit unites with nothingness. To be one with nothingness is to be spirit; to be one with spirit is to be nothingness. How could these two have form? Only one who possesses intelligence cannot but draw near to nothingness to commune with it; one who forgets the mind becomes one with nothingness.

Lu says: The body, having substance, becomes obstructive; the mind, having attachments, becomes fixated. The body uniting with the mind does not lie in physical obstruction but in breaking fixation. Thus qi, though moving, has no fixation. The mind uniting with qi does not lie in fixation but in dynamic function. Thus qi uniting with spirit does not lie in movement but in clear perception. Spirit uniting with nothingness transcends all form, so it does not lie in perception but in profound union with the real.

When there is the slightest presence or sound—whether far away at the eight wilds’ edge or near at one’s brows and lashes—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Only the vast openness of nothingness does not disturb the sage’s thoughts. In traversing the realm of being, the illumination of spirit and clarity knows no difference of far or near. Yet one does not know that this is what the seven orifices and four limbs perceive, what the heart, belly, and six viscera know—it is merely self-knowing. When all destinations are forgotten, how could there be any attainment of awareness?

Lu says: Thus, with form and sound, no matter how distant or near, whatever comes to disturb me, I can know it all—without employing the four limbs or seven orifices. Like a bright mirror hung high, it illuminates of itself; how could it rely on the ears?

The Duke of Lu was greatly pleased. Later, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.

Kang Cang’s words are exhausted—what more could Confucius say? Yet by answering with silence, he answers indeed, entrusting it to a smile.

Lu says: To entrust it to a smile is to grasp the purport of forgetting words.

*Zhenghe* observes: Even when eyes see and ears hear, one remains bound to form. When seeing and hearing are not employed, the ears and eyes detach from form. For ears and eyes, though engaged in seeing and hearing, remain tied to form and thus still fall short. Only when ears and eyes are not used does form fill the void. One sees in darkness, hears in silence, and unites with spirit—who in the world could comprehend this? When the body aligns with the heart, one moves from externals inward; when the heart aligns with qi, one proceeds from solidity to emptiness. When qi aligns with spirit, one stands beyond reckoning; when spirit aligns with nothingness, one acts without fixed direction. Not listening with the ears but listening with qi, I encounter with spirit rather than seeing with the eyes—this is what is meant by entering the infinitesimal with what is not. Whether the solidity of *jieran*, the smallness of form, the resonance of *weiran*, or the subtlety of sound—whether far beyond the eight wilds or near between the brows—it is not that nothing exists, but that one is confined by form and moved by sound. Though I dismiss keen perception to merge with the great penetration, whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it—yet how could I know *how* I know? Thus it is said: it is merely self-knowing. Confucius’ smile without answer was a smile that did not know how to answer.

Fan says: Ears and eyes are form; seeing and hearing are their function. Only when spirit is utterly lucid, with no obstruction, can one see with the ears and hear with the eyes—yet this merely exchanges their functions, not transcends their use. But when, beyond form, one sees solely with spirit in the realm of the soundless and listens solely with qi in the domain of the formless, then ears and eyes are not used, yet keen perception endures. Thus the Duke of Lu marveled all the more. Tracing how this is achieved, there must be a Way. When the body aligns with the heart, its discernment is flawless, free from the heart’s delusions. When the heart aligns with qi, it congeals, free from forcing qi. Qi moves without cease, its transformations rooted in spirit; when qi aligns with spirit, they fuse without gap. Spirit is omnipresent, its function ever resting in nothingness; when spirit aligns with nothingness, they merge as one. Those who debate things as small cling to the solidity of *jieran*; those who respond to things are moved by the resonance of *weiran*. Though it lies beyond the eight wilds, can it be called distant? The Dao is present here, undivided by distance. Though it lies within the brows, can it be called near? The Dao is present here, undivided by proximity. With great wisdom observing all, nothing can interpose; without distinction of far or near, one knows whatever comes from without, yet the body is fundamentally no-body—thus what the seven orifices and four limbs perceive, I do not know. Observing within, the heart is fundamentally no-heart—thus what the heart, belly, and six viscera know, I do not know. True knowing is no-knowing, yet nothing is unknown—is this not the work of spirit? When the Dao reaches this point, it is complete, perfect, beyond augmentation. Thus the Duke of Lu told Confucius, and Confucius smiled without answering.

The Grand Steward of Shang asked Confucius: “Is Qiu a sage?”
Confucius said: “How dare Qiu claim sagacity? What the world calls sages merely follow their traces—how could they know what makes one a sage or not? Yet Qiu is one who has broadly studied and retains much.”
He merely appears to have broadly studied and retained much—truly, he has nothing he has studied, nothing he has retained.

*Zhenghe* notes: Though the Master was a sage, he said, “How dare I claim sagacity?”—for he did not presume to occupy sagacity. Though broadly learned, he left no name; though retaining much, he unified it with one thread—this is why Confucius is the culmination of greatness.

Fan says: The man of Daxiang knew enough to recognize a sage, thus he said, “broadly learned yet leaving no name.” The Old Man of Hanyin did not know enough to recognize a sage, thus he said, “broadly learned to emulate sages.” Yet if the sage has no name, who can name him? Broad learning and much retention were spoken only in response to the Grand Steward of Shang. Yet when he told Zigong, “Do you take me for one who has broadly studied and retained much?” he said, “I unify it with one thread—why?” Broad learning and much retention are how the *Doctrine of the Mean* aligns with humanity; unifying with one thread is how it reaches the utmost clarity to align with Heaven.

The Grand Steward of Shang said: “Were the Three Kings sages?”
Confucius said: “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”
He said: “Were the Five Emperors sages?”
Confucius said: “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”
He said: “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?”
Confucius said: “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in employing what accords with the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”

Confucius’ broad learning, Tang and Wu’s martial might, Yao and Shun’s yielding deference, Fuxi and Shennong’s simplicity—these are all coarse traces of sages responding to the world’s affairs, not what makes one a sage. What makes one a sage is fundamentally beyond the reach of words and traces.

Lu says: To clarify that the great Dao is not a trace, one must replace what others expound, for they know only traces. Thus the Master, following what people commonly see, sought to illuminate the truly real sage.

*Zhenghe* notes: The Sovereigns spoke of the Dao, the Emperors of virtue, the Kings of enterprise. Skill in employing what accords with the times is how the Dao is enacted; skill in employing benevolence and righteousness is how virtue is perfected; skill in employing wisdom and courage is how enterprise is cultivated. Yet these are the burdens of action, not the affairs of non-action—thus he said, “whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”

Though the Sovereigns, Emperors, and Kings established their roles in response to the times, these are but traces. What makes their traces possible is not what makes them sages.

Fan says: The Kings spoke of enterprise, hence their skill in employing wisdom and courage; the Emperors spoke of virtue, hence their skill in employing benevolence and righteousness; the Sovereigns spoke of the Dao, hence their skill in employing what accords with the times. Yet these are but coarse traces of responding to the world—how could they be what makes one a sage? Thus the Master declared he knew not whether they were sages, and thereby revealed that they did not embody sageliness.

The Grand Steward Shang was greatly startled: what the world called sages, Confucius dismissed as non-sages—this was why he was so astonished. He asked, "Then who is a sage?" Confucius altered his expression and paused before saying, "There are sages among the people of the West. Is sageliness bound to any fixed place?" He spoke thus to point toward what lies utterly beyond. "There are sages there who govern not, yet there is no disorder; they do not govern through governance, hence disorder cannot arise. They speak not, yet are trusted; those who speak are not trusted. They transform not, yet their Way is enacted; those who act cannot transform. This is the perfection of non-action. Vast and boundless, the people cannot name them."

He Yan’s *On the Nameless* states: "What the people praise has a name; what is unpraised is nameless. As for the sage, his name is no-name, his praise is no-praise. To call no-name the Dao and no-praise the great is to speak of the nameless as though it had a name, and the unpraised as though it had praise. Yet how could this be the same as what can be named or praised? Compared to having nothing, these all have something. Yet within what has something, one must align with what has nothing, differing from those who possess something. Like attracts like, no matter how distant; unlike repels, no matter how near. It is like the yang within yin or the yin within yang, each seeking its own kind. Summer is yang, yet its nights, far removed, share yin with winter; winter is yin, yet its days, far removed, share yang with summer. All differ from what is near yet align with what is distant. Only by examining this interplay of sameness and difference can the discourse on the nameless be understood. What brings one to this realization? The Dao alone is what has nothing. Since the beginning of heaven and earth, all things have had something. Yet we still call it the Dao because it can return to and employ what has nothing. Thus, though dwelling in the realm of names, it effaces the image of the nameless. It is like the distant body of yang forgetting that it shares a distant kind with yin."

Xiahou Xuan says: "Heaven and earth operate through spontaneity; the sage employs spontaneity. Spontaneity is the Dao. The Dao fundamentally has no name, hence Laozi said, 'Forced to name it.' Confucius called Yao 'vast and boundless, beyond naming,' yet later spoke of his 'lofty achievements'—these were forced names, taken from what the world knows. How could one who has a name then be said to be beyond naming? Only the nameless can be named with all the names under heaven, yet how could these be its true names? To grasp this analogy yet remain unenlightened is like gazing upon the towering Mount Tai and claiming the primal qi is not vast and boundless."

I suspect they may be sages—yet do I truly know they are sages? Or are they not sages? The principle of sageliness is profoundly obscure, hence it cannot be described in words; one can only remain in doubt.

The Grand Steward Shang fell silent, pondering in his heart: "Confucius has deceived me!" Such matters lie beyond common understanding, so he took them for deception.

Lu says: "Those who establish traces to exalt teachings and manifest conduct to inspire transformation are but worthy sages who save the age. As for those who embody the great Dao, they cover and support like heaven and earth, their transformations flow like the four seasons. One sees no governance, yet there is no disorder; no reliance on speech, yet trust is assured. Their bounty flows abundantly, benefiting the myriad things; their vastness embraces all beings, yet their profundity is hard to fathom. To ascribe a place to such sages or define them in words is still to fall short of the ultimate. Thus, the Master spoke in terms of doubt and semblance to transcend language. This is what the Grand Steward could not comprehend, taking it as mere deception by Confucius."

*Zhenghe* notes: "Zhuangzi spoke of Suiren, Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, and the sage-kings from Tang and Yu onward, all as declines in virtue. Confucius, in dismissing the governance of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings as not truly sagely, then pointed to the people of the West, saying there are sages among them—this is because the Dao turns with the ages. The sage accords with the times. The governance of the Five Emperors and Three Kings gathered the myriad beginnings in the flourishing assembly of their eras, like spring and summer in the cycle of seasons. One sees only their outward royal enterprises, hence he said, 'I do not know if they were sages.' The people of the West, having turned from refinement back to simplicity, are like autumn and winter in the cycle—still and sagely. Thus he said, 'There are sages there.'

Only when there is no governance does governance arise; without the affair of governance, how can there be disorder? Hence, they govern not, yet there is no disorder. Those who require speech to be trusted lack true trust; silent understanding needs no words, hence they speak not, yet are trusted. The enactment of the Dao’s transformation leaves traces of action; transformation without trace—who could impose action upon it? Thus, they transform not, yet their Way is enacted. This is the meaning of 'nothing is done, yet all is spontaneously so.'

The Dao cannot be named, for it has no boundaries. Hence, 'vast and boundless, the people cannot name it.' Yet sageliness cannot be known—calling it sageliness, how could this be true? Thus, one can only doubt whether they are sages. The Grand Steward, finding these words far from human sentiment, was first shocked and startled. Seeking to measure them by conventional standards and finding no answer, he ultimately fell silent, pondering in his heart that Confucius had deceived him."

Fan said: Those who possess land possess great things, yet those who possess great things cannot be possessed by things. Only by not being a thing can one master things—this is how the ancients kept the world in its natural state, never hearing of "governing" the world. From the Three Dynasties onward, men abandoned the serene and effortless Way, delighting instead in the clamor of empty praise, bending and shaping rites and music to correct the world’s form. Alas! They soothed the world’s heart with benevolence and righteousness, calling this "governance"—what greater disorder could there be? Thus, the sage’s governance operates beyond rectification, ensuring only that those capable of their tasks perform them. Therefore, in leisurely non-action, the myriad things are freed from entanglement—why should I trouble myself with governing the world?

In establishing teaching, there is no burden of words, and so they trust themselves. In enacting transformation, there are no traces of transformation, and so it proceeds of itself. The Dao is eternally nameless; from a human perspective, though one sees its vastness, its great and nameless simplicity remains beyond all description. The people say, "We are naturally so—what has the emperor’s power to do with us?" Is this not what Zhuangzi meant by "the sage has no name"? Yet whether one is a sage or not, when doubt arises and knowledge fails, one approaches the divine mystery of the unknowable sage.

The Grand Steward was unfit to discuss such matters, hence he took Confucius’ words as deception.

Zixia asked Confucius, "What sort of man is Yan Hui?"
The Master said, "Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zigong?"
The Master said, "Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zilu?"
The Master said, "You’s courage surpasses my own."
Zixia asked, "What sort of man is Zizhang?"
The Master said, "Shi’s dignity surpasses my own." (Yet he prided himself on that dignity.)
Zixia rose from his mat and asked, "Then why do these four serve you?"
The Master said, "Sit, and I will tell you.

Hui can be benevolent but cannot adapt—
*Adapt* means to change. Clinging to one way without the wisdom to respond to things, wherever he goes, he will meet obstruction.
Lu said: One may journey with him toward the Dao, but not share in its flexibility.

Ci can be eloquent but cannot be reticent—
Lu said: He has the ability to advance, but has not yet ascended to the Dao.

You can be brave but cannot be timid—
Lu said: He knows only the masculine, not how to guard the feminine.

Shi can be dignified but cannot be harmonious.
Eloquence that cannot be reticent must lack the substance of loyalty and trust. Bravery that cannot be timid must violate the principle of the seven forbearances. Dignity that cannot be harmonious contravenes the meaning of blending with light. All these are fixations on one aspect.
Lu said: He guards his solemnity but cannot harmonize with things, losing the virtue of harmony.

Were I to exchange my Way for the possession of all four of these, I would not consent. These four each excel in one virtue; if they combined them and sought to alter my Way, I would not permit it. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty. The convergence of such qualities should be entrusted to the sage, and thus I cannot dismiss them.

Lu said: Though they possess benevolence, eloquence, dignity, and courage, I would not exchange my Way for them—how much less if they did not possess them all. The Master could encompass what the four could not, and so they served him without divided hearts.

This discussion concerns the greatest matters of the Dao, which are further expounded in the chapters on *Concealment and Display*.

Zhenghe: The sage’s Way is supremely lofty, yet it embodies the Mean. Whether in excess or deficiency, neither is the Dao. The worthy err in excess, and the sage takes nothing from them. Hui can be benevolent but cannot adapt—this is not great benevolence. Ci can be eloquent but cannot be reticent—this is not great eloquence. You can be brave but cannot be timid—this is not great courage. Shi can be dignified but cannot be harmonious—this is not blending with light. Though they do not encompass all aspects, each has a partial grasp of the Dao, and each has its use in its time. As for the Master’s great completeness, he embodies the Dao in its entirety.

Those four disciples, looking up to the sage, knew their own limitations. Thus, though Confucius deemed each superior to himself in their respective virtues, how could they serve him with divided loyalty?

Fan said: Yan Yuan grasped the *act* of the Way but not its *source*—thus, though he might not transgress for three months, he could not master himself for a single day. Is this not being able to be benevolent but unable to adapt? Zigong grasped the *words* of the Way but not their *source*—thus, Confucius ranked him among those skilled in speech, and Mencius praised his excellence in rhetoric. Is this not being able to be eloquent but unable to be reticent? When the Master spoke of sailing on a raft, some mocked his fondness for courage beyond their own; when asked about leading an army, some mocked his caution in the face of danger—thus, You’s ability to be brave but not timid is evident. Adorning his imposing demeanor made it difficult for him to practice benevolence; maintaining his lofty aspirations left his conduct exposed—thus, Shi’s ability to be dignified but not harmonious is evident.

These four were not complete talents, and so the sage would not exchange his Way for their combined virtues. Yet the Master’s Way is like the sea: whether small or great, whether much or little, each takes what they can and gains accordingly.

*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Nine* concludes.
*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Ten* begins.

Confucius, after Master Liezi had studied under Master Huqiu Zilin, daily diminished his reliance on teachers. Befriending Bohun Maoren, he then dwelled in Nanguo. Those who followed him grew daily in number, yet still could not be fully counted. Visitors came in an unbroken stream, and though he sorted and attended to them each day, he could not exhaust their multitude. Even so, Liezi remained unassuming—he himself did not know their number. Day after day, they debated together, and no discourse went unheard. Master and disciples lectured and practiced, their teachings resounding near and far.

Lu observed: Though the visitors were many and Liezi knew not their number, through daily discourse and instruction, no trace of the sage remained unheard. Yet for twenty years, he shared a wall with Nanguozi and never paid him a visit. Their Ways merged in profound harmony, and so, though they lived to old age, they did not call upon one another. When they met upon the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other, for when the Dao is present, sight is rendered void. The disciples and servants of his gate believed Liezi and Nanguozi must be adversaries without doubt—hostile enemies.

Lu noted: The multitude suspected enmity and resentment, seeing they did not visit one another. One who had come from Chu asked Liezi: "Master, what enmity do you bear toward Nanguozi?" Liezi replied: "Nanguozi’s appearance is whole, his heart empty; his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his heart knows nothing, his form stirs not. What should I do when I go to him? *Whole* means complete. When the heart is empty, the form is whole—thus his ears are not deluded by sound, his eyes not ensnared by form, his mouth does not choose its words, his heart does not employ knowledge; inner and outer merge as one, and so his form knows no tremor."

Lu said: Though his appearance is whole and his heart utterly still, he is not swayed by the distinctions of ears, eyes, heart, or mouth. Thus his heart has no use, and his form no cause for anxiety or fear. Nevertheless, let us go together. He gathered forty disciples and set out as one.

This journey was not to select the superior or inferior, nor to measure the long or short—forty being a fitting number, it was thus recorded. Upon seeing Nanguozi, he indeed appeared like a *qipo*—unapproachable. *Qipo*: a scholar. Another explanation reads *qitou*. His spirit congealed, his form dissolved; external things could not glimpse him.

Turning to regard Liezi, his form and spirit were not paired, and he could not join the company. For his spirit commanded his form. With no thoughts in his heart, his appearance showed no movement—thus they seemed not to govern one another, and how could external things find fellowship with him?

Lu said: "The forty disciples who went to see him indeed found him like a *qipo* in the likeness of a man, or as one with a *qitou*—his form and spirit could not be engaged. Suddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke to him. Though he stood in the last row, there was no rank of noble or base. He responded to what moved him, not by intent toward things. He appeared *kankan*, as if single-minded and dominant.

When principle reaches its utmost, there are no words; when words arise, the distinction between self and other emerges. The sage responds and adapts, merging with things—thus to observe his form, one might think he seeks rightness and values victory.

Lu said: "Those in the rear rank still cling to judgments of right and wrong—*kankan*, overflowing with the air of seeking victory." Liezi’s disciples were startled. Seeing him dwell like a corpse, they took him for wood or earth; seeing him engage with things, they thought him entangled in right and wrong—hence their shock.

Returning to their lodging, all bore expressions of doubt. Lu said: "They doubt whether he has truly forgotten the heart of victory and defeat."

Fan said: "Nanming—dwelling in the southern quarter, he embodies the intent of seclusion yielding to illumination. Those who follow him count the days without ceasing, speaking of preserving your multitude. Daily they debate, hearing all—speaking of their diligent practice. Yet for twenty years, though he shared a wall with Nanguozi, they never visited or inquired. This was their Way’s mutual forgetting, no exchange between them. When they met on the path, their eyes seemed not to see each other—this was their Way’s silent accord, no need for recognition. The disciples of the gate thus took him for a rival without doubt, never realizing that one who embodies the Dao merges self and other, never establishing opposition."

One came from Chu to ask, and Liezi told him: "Nanguozi’s appearance is whole—complete and unblemished. His heart is empty—hollowed and devoid of things. His ears hear only by turning inward; his eyes see only by gazing within. In silence, he recognizes—thus there are no words. In awareness, he merges—thus there is no knowledge. If this is so, then stepping beyond form, who would tremble in fear? He has departed from men and abides in constant stillness. To go is delusion; to act is pretense—hence it is said: *What should one do when going?*

Yet the Dao is nowhere absent, and nowhere is it unfit to go. That forty disciples journeyed together speaks of those with feet arriving at the mound. Seeing Nanguozi, he indeed appeared like a *qipo*—unapproachable, seeming almost inhuman. Regarding Liezi, his form and spirit were not paired, and he could not join the company—appearing as if bereft of vitality.

Suddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke—emerging as if plucked, responding to what moved him, compelled to speak. His words were like those of a maiden—when did he ever intend to speak? Thus, from without, one might see him *kankan*, delighting in the Dao. In stillness, he was single-minded; in movement, direct. Though he seemed to value things and seek victory, what is called *not striving for dominance* remained undisturbed.

Those who came with him were still doubtful—how could they, opposing the world with the Dao, not be startled? Liezi said: "One who attains non-intent has no words; one who advances knowledge also has no words. Exhausting principle and embodying its utmost, words and intent are both forgotten. Using non-words as words is still words; using non-knowledge as knowledge is still knowledge.

Those who seek to abolish words with non-words and dispel knowledge with non-knowledge—followers of rare speech and peripheral teachings—remain bound to words and knowledge. Non-words and not speaking, non-knowledge and not knowing—these are also words, also knowledge. By comparison, one might wish to preserve the natural, dwelling in the realm of no words and no knowledge—yet this is again to dispel what cannot be dispelled, to know what cannot be known.

To dispel what cannot be dispelled is to fail to depart from dispelling; to know what cannot be known is never to forget knowledge. This is not the natural forgetting of words and knowledge. There is nothing not spoken, nothing not known; there is nothing spoken, nothing known. For non-words are the origin of words; non-knowledge is the master of knowledge.

The heart of the perfected one is vast and empty, responding to things with words—not his own words. Knowing through things—not his own knowledge. Thus, though he speaks all day, he bears no name of profound silence; though he employs knowledge all day, he bears no name of toiling thought. Hence, there is nothing not spoken, nothing not known. It is only thus.

Why this groundless alarm? Failing to grasp where the subtlest converges, one takes the coarse as finer; failing to reach the highest, one turns downward—and then marvels at the strange demeanor of one who responds in stillness, the differing mien of his movement and rest. What is this if not deluded shock?

Lu said: "Utmost knowledge and intent both forget words. If there were distinctions of superiority and inferiority, words would be needed to guide them. Using the words of non-words, the knowledge of non-knowledge—how is this different? Though words and knowledge pertain to the Dao, one should discern them—thus there are times when one does not speak, times when one does."

Unknowing, yet not unknowing. The principle is precisely thus—why this groundless wonder?

*Zhenghe* notes: "Those who count the days yet cannot reach him speak of how many come together, yet none can match the Master. Even Liezi is but faintly discernible"—meaning Liezi’s Dao cannot be seen. "Day after day they debate, yet hear nothing"—the Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is to miss it. When debate arises unavoidably, what is heard is but shallow. "For twenty years, though living side by side, they never visited one another"—this aligns with Laozi’s principle of non-intercourse. "Meeting on the Way, their eyes seemed not to see each other"—thus the Dao exists without need for visual confirmation. "The hundred bones, nine orifices—all are complete"—this is what is meant by "form fully realized." "Void and empty, invisible to the eye"—this is what is meant by "heart emptied." Though possessing human form, with ears, eyes, mouth, and features all intact, he has no human emotions—thus no hearing, no seeing, no speech, no knowledge, no fear, his chamber utterly vacant. The spirit seems present, yet the form is not true—like an image of a man. "Form and spirit not paired"—this means the spirit does not abide in the form. "Joyful and upright, as if steadfast and virile"—this means he cannot know the virile yet abides in the feminine. With Liezi’s Dao, even Nan Guo views him thus—no wonder his disciples were startled and all bore expressions of doubt.

Words serve to convey the Dao. Words reside in meaning; grasp the meaning and forget the words—hence it is said, "One who grasps the meaning speaks not." What can be discussed in words is but the ancestor of things, yet one remains ignorant of what lies within. Thus it is said, "One who advances in knowledge also speaks not." To use wordlessness as speech is the highest speech; to use unknowing as knowledge is the highest knowledge. Aligning my wordlessness with the Dao’s non-speech, my unknowing with the Dao’s unknowing—from the perspective of one who grasps meaning or advances in knowledge, this is also a form of speech, a form of knowledge. The Dao does not lie beyond this—what ground is there for groundless alarm?

Fan said: "What follows meaning cannot be transmitted in words—hence one who grasps meaning speaks not. What knowledge cannot know, debate cannot exhaust—hence one who advances in knowledge also speaks not. Wordlessness is the Dao. To use wordlessness as speech is still not to forget words. Unknowing is the Dao. To use unknowing as knowledge is still not to forget knowledge. Though words may not be forgotten, there is that which has never been spoken—this too lies within the realm of the speakable. Though knowledge may not be forgotten, there is that which has never been known—this too lies within the realm of the knowable. Speech and knowledge, in themselves, neither bind nor burden. Responding to things in speech, one speaks without limit—yet in truth speaks not. Engaging with things in knowledge, one knows without limit—yet in truth knows not. The Dao, as described above, is merely thus. What then is there to marvel at?"

Liezi was a student. As stated in the previous chapter, "Liezi studied the art of riding the wind." After three years, his heart dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang grant him a single glance. After five years, his heart again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, whatever his heart desired to ponder, there was no right or wrong; whatever his mouth desired to speak, there was no profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him near to share his seat. Glances and smiles, shared seating—it seemed as though there were praise or censure, elevation or demotion. Yet the sage’s heart responds to affairs, gauging by the measure of external things—how could it be fixed to one side? After nine years, whatever his heart desired to ponder, whatever his mouth desired to speak, he neither knew his own judgments of right and wrong, profit and harm, nor those of others—inner and outer had merged. Only then were his eyes like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all alike. His heart congealed, his form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly fused. He was unaware of what his body leaned against, where his feet trod, what his heart pondered, or what his words concealed. Merely thus—the principle was nowhere hidden.

This chapter also appears in the *Huangdi* section, where it is explained in detail. Its repetition here first clarifies the ultimate attainment of nature, enabling boundless transformation; later, it elucidates the principle of following the heart, revealing that nothing, however obscure, does not submit. The two chapters appear in tandem, each with its own intent—how can one fail to examine them closely?

Lu said: Laozi said, "Great wisdom appears foolish, great eloquence appears inarticulate." People only recognize the strangeness of speech, not the sameness of wordlessness and unknowing. Thus, the *Huangdi* section clarifies the use of wordless speech to aid others, while this section reiterates the discussion of speech, showing that its use is no different from wordlessness.

*Zhenghe* notes: "At first, a single glance—this speaks of the Dao residing in the meeting of eyes. A relaxed countenance and smile—this speaks of the heart’s attainment beyond form’s dissolution. Drawing him near to share a seat—this is advancement, joining with him. When inner and outer merge, the mystery becomes unfathomable. Form is full, the heart empty—thus the heart congeals, the form dissolves, bones and flesh wholly fuse, reaching the utmost of form—hence the principle is nowhere hidden."

Fan said: "Riding the wind still depends on something. Thus, the previous chapter discussed the art of riding the wind, while this one does not repeat it, to show that Liezi’s learning was not merely this." Initially, Liezi loved to wander. Huqiuzi said: "Yu Kou loves to wander—what does he love in wandering?" Liezi replied: "The joy of wandering lies in the ever-new delight of what one encounters." When others wander, they observe what they see...

My wandering observes its transformations. People call them "ordinary folk" or "petty men"—they see only glory and decay as distinct sights, taking them for joy and sorrow, unaware that all moves with the flux, its momentum never pausing for even a moment. Wandering, ah, wandering—none can discern the nature of this wandering. When people wander with Liezi, their paths are the same; what they wander toward differs. Thus it is said: "Wandering, ah, wandering," to clarify the divergence of these two perspectives. None have debated this, meaning few truly understand.

Lu said: "Delighting in the transformations of things, which shift and fade without constancy—others merely take pleasure in what they see, while I observe their changes. This is how I differ from them."

Huqiuzi said: "Does Liezi’s wandering truly align with others’, or is it fundamentally distinct?" All that is seen is ever seen in its transformations. If there is no momentary pause, then what is seen now is never what was seen before. Thus, to observe what is seen and to observe what changes—where lies the difference? To delight in the endless novelty of things yet not know that I, too, am without constancy. Both things and I move together with the flux. Those who wander outwardly do not know to turn their gaze inward. The outward wanderer seeks completion in things; the inward observer finds sufficiency within. Finding sufficiency within—this is the perfection of wandering; seeking completion in things—this is its failure.

Though man is but a seven-foot form, the principles of Heaven and Earth are complete within him. Thus, his head is round and feet square, taking their pattern from the Two Modes; his nose is high and mouth recessed, resembling mountains and valleys; his flesh and muscles connect to the earth’s soil, his blood and vessels belong to rivers and streams; his warmth and steam are one with scorching fire, his breath no different from wind and clouds. Inwardly observing the myriad forms, not a single thing is lacking. Why must one gaze upward and downward, tread through court and countryside, only then to complete what is seen?

He said: "You consider yourself different from others. Yet what others see has never differed from what you see. Why? You know things, know their transformations, but do not know your own lack of constancy. Thus, you wander only outwardly and do not observe inwardly. Though moved by things, you lose yourself—this is the utmost, so why seek completion in outward wandering?"

Thereupon, Liezi never left his home for the rest of his life, believing himself ignorant of wandering. Having heard these ultimate words, he abandoned his excursions and observations. Not leaving did not mean secluding himself within his gates.

* * *
What delights is without constancy, thus ever new. Others’ wandering observes only appearances—forms, sounds, and colors. My wandering observes transformations—flux and reflux, fullness and emptiness. None can discern the nature of this wandering, for the difference between the two is scarcely known. Yet even those who perceive through their nature, in what they see, ever see its transformations. Thus it is said: "All that is seen—is it not ever seen in its transformations?" If I follow after things, I merely see their lack of constancy. Turning outward reflection inward, then what is within me is never not ever new. Thus it is said: "Delighting in the lack of constancy in things, one does not know that I, too, am without constancy."

Those who wander outwardly follow things and cling to them, seeing things but not their nature; the inward observer turns to the self and finds sincerity, seeing nature but not things. Chasing echoes for their sound—this is the kind that seeks completion in things. Dwelling in shade to rest one’s shadow—this is the kind that finds sufficiency within. Thus, the perfection or failure of wandering lies solely in the distinction between inward and outward. Liezi never leaving his home for life—this is what it means to return and seek within oneself.

Huqiuzi said: "Is this the perfection of wandering?" Earlier, he questioned Liezi’s words on wandering, not yet discussing wandering in its perfection, hence the reiteration.

The perfection of wandering knows not where it goes; the perfection of observation knows not what it sees. Sufficient within oneself, thus knowing not where it goes; reflecting back upon the self, thus knowing not what it sees. All things wander, all things observe. Forgetting wandering, one can encounter things and wander; forgetting observation, one can encounter things and observe. This is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation. What I affirm is, in truth, to affirm nothing. Where one goes is ever unobstructed, without fixation—this is what I call wandering and observation. Thus it is said: "Is this the perfection of wandering? Is this where wandering truly lies?"

Lu said: "When the body goes nowhere, the eyes fix on nothing, then nothing is not seen, and nothing is not wandered. Such wandering and observation—is this not the true perfection of wandering?"

* * *
The perfection of wandering moves with one’s nature; the perfection of observation sees through one’s nature. To have a destination is to have limits—how can nature have limits? Thus, the perfection of wandering knows not where it goes. To have something seen is to have obstruction—how can nature have obstruction? Thus, the perfection of observation knows not what it sees. Wandering without bounds yet truly wandering nowhere, observing without bounds yet truly observing nothing—above, one wanders with the Creator. Such is all.

Thus it is said: "Is this the perfection of wandering?"

Fan said: "The transformations of things are endless—what is old there is new here. With yin and yang, the old and new replace each other—this is Heaven. With dwelling and parting, the old and new replace each other—this is man. The joy of wandering lies in delighting in what is without constancy, thus where one goes is ever new. Yet others’ wandering observes what they see, taking the glory of things as their sole delight. My wandering observes their transformations, thus wandering with the Creator and observing amidst the teeming multitudes. Wandering, ah, wandering—who knows how this is so? Liezi’s love of wandering clarifies this. Yet even so, the perspectives of things and self differ. This is still not the utmost. Thus, to take others’ wandering as observing what they see, not knowing they too ever see its transformations; to take the joy of wandering as delighting in what is without constancy, not knowing that I, too, am without constancy."

Those who merely strive for external wandering and neglect inner contemplation—how could they ever attain the carefree and effortless state, wandering where things cannot pursue yet all abide? *Zhuangzi* says: "If one has the capacity to wander, how could they not wander? If one lacks the capacity to wander, how could they wander?" Only those who embody the Dao can wander through the world without bias.

Thus, those who focus on inner contemplation proceed from victory within, moving through the nameless. Those who pursue external wandering seek completeness in things, proceeding from victory without, their aspirations fixed on extravagance. To find sufficiency within oneself, with one’s contemplation fixed on the Dao—this is the utmost wandering. To seek completeness in things, with one’s wandering fixed on things—this is wandering that does not reach its utmost. The joy of wandering differs so greatly.

Thus, Master Feng believed himself ignorant of wandering, and Master Huqiu further instructed him in the teachings of wandering and contemplation. To be wholly occupied with observing the unerring—this is called the utmost wandering, where one does not know where they go yet finds their own ease. To perceive all things as boundless—this is called the utmost contemplation. Not knowing where one’s limits lie, one merely polishes what is within.

In such a state, the Dao does not oppose things, and no thing is not the Dao. Then every thing becomes a place of wandering, every thing a subject of contemplation—this is what I call wandering, this is what I call contemplation. All things are complete within me; turning inward to find sincerity, no joy could be greater. Why then make external wandering one’s sole pursuit?

When the Dao reaches this point, it is perfect, complete—nothing can be added. The ancients, whether known or unknown by others, remained serene in this way. This is nearly the state of which I speak.

Longshu said to Wen Zhi: "Your art is subtle. I have an affliction—can you cure it?" Wen Zhi replied: "I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your ailment." Lu said: "What Wen Zhi treats are merely illnesses of the organs, bones, and flesh. What Longshu speaks of is the heart that forgets form and transcends the common. Not belonging to the vulgar kind, he takes this as his affliction."

Longshu said: "Praise from my village does not bring me honor; slander from the state does not bring me shame. Gain does not make me rejoice; loss does not make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, and others as swine."

Wherever one goes, all is equal—thus one sees the myriad things as free from preference or aversion, nobility or baseness. One sees oneself as others; self and other are forgotten. Dwelling in one’s home is like meeting at an inn—one does not possess it as one’s own. Viewing one’s village is like gazing upon a land of barbarians. All under heaven is one.

These manifold afflictions cannot be swayed by rank or reward, nor cowed by punishment or penalty. Prosperity and decline, profit and harm cannot alter them; sorrow and joy cannot shift them. Thus one cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What binds a person to external things is the heart’s likes and dislikes, the body’s perceptions of benefit and harm. If one can regard the ten thousand differences as a single thread, how could one perceive any distinction between existence and nonexistence?

Therefore, the Son of Heaven cannot claim such a one as minister, the feudal lords cannot claim them as friend, wife and children cannot claim their intimacy, servants cannot claim their familiarity. What ailment is this? What method could cure it?

Lu said: *"The Zhuangzi* states: ‘Praise does not spur them, slander does not dishearten them. They settle the boundary between inner and outer, discern the realm of honor and disgrace.’ One who unites with the spirit while detaching from form sees poverty and wealth, life and death, human and beast, self and other as mere passing guests—what difference is there? Now, if one’s heart is thus engaged, the ways of ruler and minister, friend and companion are abandoned; the heart’s loves and hates, joys and angers are severed. What method could heal this?"

Wenzhi then instructed Long Shu to stand with his back to the light. Wenzhi himself faced the light from behind and observed him. After a moment, he exclaimed: "Ah! I see your heart now. The square inch within is empty—you are nearly a sage! Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, with but one still unopened. The old saying holds that the sage’s heart has seven apertures. Now, those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction may arise from this very cause. This is not something my shallow art can cure."

Lu said: "Standing with his back to the light means returning to the concerns of the common and vulgar. Facing the light to observe means inclining toward the heart of the supreme Dao. That the square inch is empty comes from clinging to written teachings. That one aperture remains unopened means perfection has not yet been attained. If all seven apertures were fully open, how could one still regard the Dao of sagely wisdom as a malady? This affliction is not something Wenzhi can remedy."

*Zhenghe* states: "Your art is subtle"—meaning it is wondrously refined. What Long Shu reported as an affliction, Wenzhi diagnosed as an illness, seeking only to understand its origin.

Praise and blame cannot bring him honor or disgrace; gain and loss cannot trouble or delight him; life and death cannot alter his heart; poverty and wealth cannot burden his form. Seeing others as swine, he forgets humanity’s superiority over things; seeing himself as human, he forgets his distinction from others. Dwelling in his own home as if in a transient inn, he does not linger; viewing his native land as a barbarian realm, he does not favor any place. For all these manifold afflictions, ranks and rewards cannot spur him, punishments and penalties cannot intimidate him—thus he is no longer subject to others’ control. Prosperity and decline, profit and harm cannot sway him; sorrow and joy cannot move him—thus he is no longer enslaved by things. Looking upward, he is truly unfit to serve a lord or befriend kin; looking downward, he is truly unfit to govern wife and children or command servants. Those of old who declined the world all claimed to suffer from a hidden sorrow—thus Wenzhi had Long Shu stand with his back to the light and face the light to observe him, suspecting he bore this hidden affliction.

The Dao of the sage holds nothing more precious than emptiness. Today, I see your heart—the square inch within is empty. You are nearly a sage!"

The ears, eyes, nose, and mouth are all connected to the heart; when the six apertures flow freely, the eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth. If even one aperture is blocked, the heart congeals. To regard external things—how could they be a burden? Yet those who call this an affliction—are they not akin to those who suffer from the loss of the heart?

Fan said: The ancients who embodied the Dao regarded the myriad things as one, making no distinction between self and other, and saw all forms as equal, without favor or estrangement. Though the world praised them, they remained unmoved by its murmurs; though the world condemned them, they remained untouched by its reproaches. Gaining what they deemed right brought no joy; losing it brought no sorrow. They did not see life as a cause for delight nor death as a reason for grief—life and death were simply as they were. They did not desire wealth nor despise poverty—poverty and wealth were simply as they were. They saw others as swine, forgetting distinctions of noble and base; they saw themselves as others, forgetting the divide between self and other. Dwelling in their own homes as if in a travelers’ inn, they viewed all households as alike; observing their own villages as if they were barbarian lands, they saw all villages as the same. Such a one could not be swayed by chariots and crowns, nor deterred by axes and blades; prosperity and decline, profit and harm could not alter him, nor could sorrow and joy move him. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, the feudal lords could not befriend him; even his wife and children could not draw near, nor could his servants grow familiar. The great unity of his Dao was thus. To call this an affliction and seek to cure it with medicine is to fail to recognize that it is not a condition treatable by herbs or stones.

Wenzhi then had Long Shu stand with his back to the light, for one whose heart embodies the Dao seeks the deepest recesses of the hidden. Wenzhi himself stood behind, facing the light to observe him, for one who governs others seeks to depart from the path of the hidden. Then he said: Ah! I see your heart now. The square inch within is empty, the palace of perfect clarity gleams without the slightest speck of dust, and you have attained the subtlety of the hollowed heart. The Dao of the sage is nearly within reach—thus it is said: "Your heart’s six apertures flow freely, yet one remains unopened." This is what is meant by "not yet having bridged the final gap." How could such a state be remedied by shallow arts?

That which arises without cause and yet is ever-present is the Dao. To forget all cares and accept whatever comes, whether in success or adversity, is to be without a place of death—this is the Dao of the sage.

Lu said: The supreme Dao abides eternally, not dependent on external things. To live by life is to live, and thus though one may perish, one does not vanish—this is constancy. As the *Laozi* says: "One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived." To grasp the principle of life and not lose the meeting of primordial auspiciousness is to preserve the Dao of life even unto death. This is the portion of the worthy, not the state of one who forgets all cares and darkly attains spontaneity in its fullness.

Lu said: To follow principle in true constancy, to move with the forms of life and death yet never perish—this is the constancy of the Dao. To live yet perish is misfortune. To serve the intellect in pursuit of preservation, to value the self and belittle things, to shun harm and seek profit, to be inwardly bound while outwardly laboring—even unto death, this arises from misfortune.

Lu said: To covet life and lose the Dao is misfortune. That which arises from a cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao. To follow the principle of certain death and go to the place of certain death—this is the correspondence of fact and principle, the natural Dao.

Lu said: The common understanding of ritual and teaching is that one must distinguish and proceed to death.

To die by death is to die, and thus though one may not yet have perished, one’s principle of life is already exhausted—this too is the constancy of principle.

Lu said: To cherish the body of life and death, to practice the teachings of life and death, and to take no account of the Dao or the world as constant.

To die yet live is fortune. To violate principle and defy what is fitting, to deserve death yet not meet it—this is to be mistakenly alive.

Lu said: To dwell in the work of change and decline yet restrain one’s desires is also to know the fortune of life.

Thus, to live without use is called the Dao; to use the Dao and attain completion is called constancy. To employ the Dao of the sage is to preserve or perish yet remain in accord with principle.

To die through use is also called the Dao; to use the Dao and attain death is also called constancy. To ride the principle of peril and harm one’s own body—this too is the constancy of the Dao.

Lu said: Not to serve the intellect in pursuit of preservation is the Dao. To use this Dao and reach completion is constancy. The common man serves his intellect unto death, believing it the Dao of aiding others. To use this Dao and reach death is also called constancy.

What the multitude delights in, the multitude calls the Dao. What the multitude finds secure, the multitude calls constancy. Thus, the Dao of transcendence and the Dao of the world share the same name but differ in reality.

*Zhenghe* commentary: What is prized in the Dao is that it can determine life and death. The Dao alone abides and is ever-present, existing everywhere without exception. Abiding alone and ever-present, it is said: "That which arises without cause and yet is ever-living." Existing everywhere without exception, it is said: "That which arises from a cause and yet is ever-dying." To live by the Dao is to die yet not perish—this is the constancy of principle. Thus it is said: "To live by life is to live, and thus though one may perish, one does not vanish—this is constancy." As for living yet perishing, this is not the true mandate, hence it is called misfortune. To die by the Dao is to perish before completion yet not regard it as a change, thus it is said: "Though one may not yet have perished, one’s life principle is already exhausted—this too is constancy." As for dying yet living, this is a deluded life, a fortunate escape, hence it is said: "To die yet live is fortune."

The inception of creation and transformation, the changes of yin and yang—having transformed to give birth, and transforming again to transform—all proceed from the Dao, all submit to fate. To be born even as one dies is simply the constant state of things.

Master Fan says: The Dao encompasses but two things—death and life. Life is the inception of creation and transformation; death is the change of yin and yang. Those who embody the Dao comprehend the workings of all things, and thus death and life are but great matters to them, beyond the reach of change. Once one enters the Dao of day and night, falls into the mechanism of exit and entry, one is born into death without awareness or realization—some delight in life yet burden the body, some forget life yet pursue profit. How could they know the reason for this?

Thus Liezi expounds and clarifies this: That which arises without cause and is ever-living can be lived by living. To live by living is to live, and thus though one may reach the end of one’s mandate, there is a principle of non-perishing—this is what makes it constant. As for living yet perishing, this is simply misfortune, as in the early death of Yan Hui. That which arises from a cause and is ever-dying can be died by dying. To die by dying is to die, and thus though one may not yet have exhausted one’s natural span, there is a way of self-exhaustion—this is what makes it constant. As for dying yet living, this is simply a fortunate escape, as in the long life of Robber Zhi.

Those who live without purpose follow the Dao of spontaneity and thus can employ the Dao to attain their end. Those who die with purpose follow the Dao of certain death and thus can employ the Dao to attain death. Both may be called constant. As for fortune and misfortune, they merely describe change.

When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu sang at his gate. Having fully followed the Dao of life and submission to the end, there was nothing to mourn. When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu wept over his corpse. Having lived in misfortune and died, there was cause for grief. The life and death of the common folk—some sing, some weep. The common folk are but the multitude. They know not why they live, nor why they die, and thus their sorrow and joy lose their balance, now singing, now weeping.

Master Lu says: Those who attain the principle of perfect life and return to its end are why the sage and worthy do not mourn. Those who lose their true nature, violate principle, and reach death are why the wise and worthy grieve. The life and death, singing and weeping of the common folk are but the constant of things—how could they know their destination?

In the *Zhenghe* [commentary]: To die yet not perish is to find joy in death, hence singing at the gate. To die in misfortune is to find grief in death, hence weeping over the corpse. As for the life and death of the common folk—some join in song, some gather in weeping—how could they know where death and life reside?

Master Fan says: The tradition states: "If one weeps on a given day, one does not sing." Song and weeping follow different paths; the rites of felicity and mourning do not interfere. Only those who embody the Dao are not thus. Ji Liang entrusted himself to the Dao, and at his death, Yang Zhu sang at his gate—was this not because he accepted his fate with equanimity, and thus death was not cause for grief? The ancients had those who sang before the corpse—this was all. Sui Wu could not forget the self, and at his death, Yang Zhu wept over his corpse—was this not because he died in misfortune, and thus his death was not to be rejoiced? The ancients had those who wept in response to weeping—this was all.

Yet sorrow and joy—are these the virtues of the perfected? Do those who have attained the Dao act with intention in such things? Though they sing at the gate, they know not who now sings. Though they weep over the corpse, it is not the wailing of those who follow in weeping. This differs from the life and death of the common folk, where some sing and some weep.

When the eyes are about to go blind, they first perceive the tip of an autumn hair. Master Lu says: The vision of the elderly is clear at a distance but dim up close—this is the gradual loss of sight. When the ears are about to go deaf, they first hear the flight of gnats. Master Lu says: In Qin, mosquitoes are called *rui*. Those with afflicted ears hear the sound of insects flying within—this is the gradual loss of hearing. When the mouth is about to lose its taste, it first distinguishes the waters of Zhi and Sheng. "Losing taste" means deviation. The waters of Zhi and Sheng have different flavors, and once mixed, they are difficult to distinguish. Master Lu says: *Yu ling* (反). Two rivers in the land of Qi. When the nose is about to become blocked, it first detects the scent of scorched and decayed matter. The scent of scorched and decayed matter has a subtle, nodal quality, also faint and hard to distinguish. When the body is about to stiffen, it first hastens in restlessness. "Stiffening" means collapse. As when Yan Yuan knew that Dongye’s driving of the horses would lead to a runaway, so too with the principle in humans. When the mind is about to be deluded, it first discerns right and wrong.

The eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, and mind—these six, when they maintain the Dao of harmony, cannot be altered or changed. Dwelling in the extreme of excess, none do not suddenly reach their end. Thus the decay of things must first begin with fullness, then proceed to deficiency. To reach the limit above is to return below; extreme flourishing must decline—this is the natural order. Therefore the sage dwells in the center and treads the path of harmony, seeing what the eyes see, hearing what the ears hear, employing the body’s abilities, following the mind’s discernment. Thus their wisdom encompasses all things, and they preserve their wholeness throughout life.

Master Lu says: When the mouth loses its proper taste, it distinguishes other flavors. When the nose loses its sense of smell, it detects other scents. When the body is about to collapse, it first hastens in restlessness. When the mind is deluded about the supreme Dao, it lies in right and wrong. Right and wrong thus become manifest, and the Dao is lost. Thus things do not return until they reach their limit. Only when they attain the extreme do they turn back. Therefore keen perception, strength, and discernment all become resources for obscurity, decline, and delusion.

Master Lu says: Returning to one’s constant nature is the path to the supreme Dao.

Thus it is said: One who gazes at the tip of an autumn hair cannot see Mount Tai; one who listens to the sound of a mosquito cannot hear thunder. Therefore *Zhuangzi* says: If you glue the eyes of Li Zhu shut, the world will all be bright; if you twist the fingers of Gongshu, the world will all be skillful. To combine the learning of Confucians and Mohists, to pride oneself on the fame of right and wrong as if it were wealth, to record the dregs of traces as if it were ability—how can one return to the real? By what means can it be attained?

Therefore the *Yijing* says: Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating. This is how the sage earnestly pursues the supreme Dao.

**Zhenghe’s Commentary:** When things reach their extreme, the mind turns back—this is the transformation of affairs. Once a form is established, it does not perish until it is exhausted, and thus it cannot escape entanglement. The sage does not fixate on form; in profound obscurity, he alone perceives the dawn; in utter silence, he alone hears harmony. How could form burden the spirit?

**Fan’s Commentary:** One who sees the tip of an autumn hair takes it for clarity, yet does not know that the five colors blind the eyes; one who hears the flight of a gnat takes it for keen hearing, yet does not know that the five sounds deafen the ears. The mouth is certainly capable of distinguishing the flavors of the Zī and the Miǎn, yet the five tastes muddy the palate, sometimes even dulling its sharpness. The nose is certainly capable of detecting the scent of burning or rot, yet the five odors choke the nostrils, sometimes even overwhelming the bridge of the nose. When the body is about to collapse, it first hastens in reckless abandon—this is why Dongye’s horse was bound to fail. When the mind is about to be deluded, it first discerns right and wrong—this is how right and wrong become manifest and the Dao is diminished.

When things reach their limit, they turn back—this is the principle of nature. The sage awakens to this and merges with obscurity. He flows with the waxing and waning of the times, advancing and retreating, preserving and perishing, without losing correctness. The seeing and hearing of the eyes and ears are not enslaved to anything; the intake and tasting of the nose and mouth are never indulged. The body harmonizes with the mind, the mind harmonizes with qi. Even life and death are great matters, yet they bring no change to him—how much less do gain and loss, fortune and misfortune affect him?

*Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing Sijie*, Scroll Ten—concluded
*Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing Sijie*, Scroll Eleven

In the marshes and gardens of Zheng, many worthies dwelled—those of Dao and virtue who remained hidden and silent. In Dongli, many talents resided—those with administrative skill who participated in state governance. Lu said: "Those who cultivate and exalt Dao and virtue are the worthy; those who study texts and scrutinize punishments are the talented."

Among the laborers of the marshes and gardens was a man named Bo Fengzi. While his cohort passed through Dongli, they encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi, a master of disputation and wisdom in the state of Zheng, wielded arguments of dual possibility, and none in his time could oppose him. He composed bamboo texts, which Zichan put to use.

Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: "Let us perform a dance for him—what will that approaching one make of it?" Some say this refers to mocking banter as playful teasing. His disciples replied: "We wish to know." (Here, "know" means "hear.") Lu said: "Deng Xi, proud among his companions, sought to deceive and toy with Bo Fengzi, and his disciples all desired to see it."

Deng Xi addressed Bo Fengzi: "Do you understand the meaning of *yangyang* (nurturing)?" Lu said: "Zhang Zhan notes: the first *yang* is pronounced like *yang* (to raise), the second like *yang* (to itch)." "Those who nurture others but cannot nurture themselves are like dogs and swine. Those who nurture things so that things serve them exercise human effort. If your followers eat their fill and rest in their clothes, it is the achievement of governance." He implied they were like dogs and swine, while he himself was the one in power.

"When the young and old gather in pens and kitchens as provisions, how are they different from dogs and swine?" Bo Fengzi did not respond—not because he could not, but because he scorned the question. Lu said: "He deemed Deng Xi ignorant of fundamentals and unworthy of engagement."

A follower of Bo Fengzi stepped forward out of turn and said: "Has the master not heard of Qi and Lu, where many cunning artisans dwell? There are those skilled in earth and woodwork, those skilled in metal and leather, those skilled in music and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are present. Yet none can occupy a position to coordinate them, nor can any direct the others. When tasks are established, they are not comprehensive; when skills are perfected, they are not all-encompassing. Those whose craft is partial and whose wisdom is matched cannot govern or command one another. The one who assigns positions lacks knowledge; the one who directs lacks ability. Yet knowledge and ability are made to serve. One who cannot know what others know, nor do what others can do, yet employs all talents—such a one does not occupy the place of knowledge or ability. Without aversion or preference, without distinction between this and that, he embodies a mind of non-action. Thus, the clear-sighted see for him, the keen-eared hear for him, the wise plan for him, the brave fight for him, and he remains without concern."

Gongchai said to Fu Gen and Xiahou Xuan: "In this world, your fame and achievements surpass mine, but your understanding falls short." Xiahou Xuan replied: "Success and fame depend on understanding. Who in the world has a deficient foundation yet excels in trifles?" He answered: "Success and fame depend on ambition, which is constrained by its own limitations. Thus, ambition and constraint are one and the same—certainly not the sole province of understanding. I can make you esteemed, but I cannot necessarily ensure the success of your endeavors. Those in power are but my instruments—why should you take pride in them?"

Deng Xi had no reply. He glanced at his disciples and withdrew. Lu said: "Only one who embodies the Dao can employ all talents for governance, utilize all things for their proper use, and ensure that chickens, dogs, oxen, and horses each fulfill their roles, while scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each remain in their places. How could your lot achieve this on your own? You see only the branches and not the root. To raise the arm of a mantis against a chariot wheel is to know no measure." Deng Xi, humiliated before his disciples, glared at them and departed.

In the *Zhenghe* commentary: "The hundred schools and myriad arts cannot interconnect, just as the ear, eye, nose, and mouth each have their strengths and timely uses. Yet a true ruler exists above them. He employs forms: earth and wood, metal and leather are made into tools; music, calculation, and writing are made into instruments; military affairs defend against external threats; ancestral rites cultivate internal harmony—all talents may be said to be present. Yet those who possess them for gain must relinquish them for use, only then can they be unified. Where there is action, there is that which cannot be done; where there is non-action, there is nothing that cannot be done. Thus it is said: 'The one who assigns positions lacks knowledge; the one who directs lacks ability. Yet knowledge and ability are made to serve.' Deng Xi did not grasp this and took pride in his governance—no wonder he was ridiculed by those of great learning."

Bo Fengzi’s silence was the eloquence of restraint. Fan said: "The worthy are spoken of in terms of virtue; the talented, in terms of ability. Bo Fengzi is the disciple mentioned earlier. Deng Xi wielded arguments of dual possibility and crafted endless words—such was the domain of the disputers. Thus, he challenged Bo Fengzi with the meaning of *yangyang*."

The *Tradition* says: "The cunning labor, the wise worry; the incapable seek nothing, eat their fill, and wander freely." One who embodies the Dao sheds cleverness and returns to incapacity—eating to satiety, resting in clothes, yet never acting. To liken such a one to dogs and swine is why Bo Fengzi could respond with silence.

As for Qi and Lu, with their many artisans: some excel in earth and woodwork, some in metal and leather, some in music and calculation, some in military affairs, some in ancestral rites—all talents are present, yet none can encompass them all. Thus, there is no one to coordinate positions or direct others, much like the saying: "The cunning labor, the wise worry." Yet in the world, those with administrative ability are many.

The hundred schools and myriad arts each possess their strengths, serving their purposes in due time—like the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, which cannot substitute for one another. Only the sage perceives the purity and wholeness of Heaven and Earth, grasping the great essence of the ancients. Thus, one does not strive to know what the multitude knows but employs those with knowledge; one does not force ability in what the multitude can do but enlists those with skill. Why then should one toil laboriously, exchanging techniques and exhausting form and mind?

This is what the Old Master meant by "using others’ strength." Gongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts to summon him. When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he saw a feeble man—*feeble* meaning weak. King Xuan, perplexed, asked: "What is your strength like?" Gongyi Bo replied: "My strength can snap the leg of a spring katydid and bear the wing of an autumn cicada." *Bear* here means to withstand. The king’s expression changed as he said: "My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or drag the tail of nine oxen, yet I still regret its weakness. You snap the leg of a spring katydid and bear the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?"

Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: "Excellent is Your Majesty’s question. I dare speak the truth. My teacher, Shangqiuzi, was unmatched in strength under Heaven, yet even his kin were unaware, for he never employed his strength. He governed things with the Way of utmost softness, and nothing could oppose him, so his achievements went unseen. I served him unto death. He instructed me: 'One who wishes to see what others cannot see must gaze where others do not look; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain must cultivate what others do not practice. People always attack what is difficult, but I alone do what is easy.'"

Lu said: "What the multitude does and sees are but the paths of profit and fame, the traces of action. What the multitude does not look upon or practice is where those of the Dao roam. Thus, one who is unmatched under Heaven has no opposing force. Therefore, those who study dimness first see a cartload of firewood; those who study hearing first hear the tolling of a bell. One who has ease within encounters no difficulty without. The ancients said: 'One skilled in strength lifts autumn down; one skilled in hearing hears thunder.' This is what it means. With no difficulty without, one’s name does not extend beyond one’s own Way. The Way’s ultimate power is profound, so its name does not become manifest."

Lu said: "A cartload of firewood is a nearby thing; the tolling of a bell is a great sound. What is easily heard and seen begins with the near and extends to the far. One who is skilled in living first nurtures their spirit. When the spirit is whole, the power of non-action becomes evident, and external things are all penetrated. Thus it is said: 'One who has ease within encounters no difficulty without.' This is attained through unity of mind and perfected in the household, so outsiders do not know. Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my teacher’s teaching, the display of my own ability. I have not yet been able to prevent my name and traces from becoming manifest. Yet my name does not betray my strength; rather, it is because I am free from self-importance that I have attained this. It is by being able to use my strength—by being skilled in using strength without employing it—that I am better than one who burdens themselves with their strength. To flaunt ability is to display its use."

Lu said: "Though I do not match my teacher’s concealment of his traces, am I not still better than one who burdens themselves with their ability and displays it?" One who harmonizes with the great Dao and transforms the myriad things is truly strong. Thus Zhuangzi said: "Hide a mountain in a marsh, conceal a boat in a ravine. One with strength carries them away in the dead of night, yet the ignorant remain unaware." But King Xuan mistook this for mere physical strength.

*Zhenghe* said: "To accumulate many small, unbeatable things into a great victory—only the sage can do this. How could this be about prizing strength? This is why not using strength is the true strength. Scholars study what they cannot study." Thus it is said: "One who wishes to see what others cannot see must gaze where others do not look; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain must cultivate what others do not practice." From having something to see, one discards and forgets it, reaching no-seeing—then one’s vision enters darkness, no different from seeing a dark corner or a cartload of firewood. From having something to hear, one discards and forgets it, reaching no-hearing—then one’s hearing enters silence, no different from hearing the tolling of a bell. When virtue does not take form, where can a name arise? Thus, to make one’s name manifest is to violate the teaching. Yet it is still better than prizing strength to seek fame—this is why one is valued in their time.

Fan said: "To snap the leg of a spring katydid and bear the wing of an autumn cicada may be called weak, yet weakness is the function of the Dao. To rend the hide of a rhinoceros or drag the tail of nine oxen may be called strong, yet strength is the path of death. Thus, under Heaven, the constant path of victory is softness, and the constant path of defeat is strength. Gongyi Bo’s teacher was unmatched in strength under Heaven, yet even his kin were unaware—was this not because he held to the constant path of victory and never employed his strength? The principle of the world is this: only one who can see what others do not look upon can see what others cannot see; only one who can cultivate what others do not practice can obtain what others cannot obtain. Seeing a cartload of firewood does not make one sharp-eyed, yet those who study vision must first see a cartload of firewood. Hearing the tolling of a bell does not make one keen-eared, yet those who study hearing must first hear the tolling of a bell. Why? One first practices what is easy and later what is difficult—then in the end, there is no difficulty. Only when there is no difficulty can no name be ascribed to one. Gongyi Bo’s strength being known among the feudal lords may seem like a violation of his teacher’s teaching and a display of his own ability, yet by being able to use his strength, he does not betray his strength."

As for those who pit strength against strength, gathering many forces to attack, even they may sometimes be subdued—how then could they gallop unchallenged beneath heaven to its most unyielding extremes? *Zhuangzi* says: "Those who employ it borrow from those who do not; by taking the long to gain its use, how much more so for that which has no unuse?" This is why Gongyi Bo’s ability to employ his strength does not compare to Shangqiuzi, of whom such things were never heard.

Zhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of the state of Wei. He was the son of Marquis Wen and composed four chapters of writings, which were called *Daoist*. When Wei conquered Zhongshan, he was enfeoffed with its lands, and thus came to be known as Zhongshan Gongzi Mou. Lu says: "Gongzi Mou was the son of Marquis Wen, enfeoffed at Zhongshan, hence called Zhongshan Gongzi." He delighted in associating with worthy men and neglected state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. Gongzi Mou and Gongsun Long seem to have lived after Liezi, yet they are mentioned here—perhaps later scholars added them to expand the text’s meaning. If such additions do not violate the overall principles and serve to clarify, what harm is there? All such passages are preserved and not removed.

Disciples of Yuezheng Ziyu laughed at him. Gongzi Mou said: "Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?" Ziyu replied: "Gongsun Long’s character is such that his conduct has no teacher, his learning no companions. He does not follow the sagely and worthy of old. He is glib but misses the mark..."

Though gifted in debate, he fails to align with reason. He wanders aimlessly without a school—Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, and the School of Names all jumbled together without a fixed doctrine. He delights in the bizarre and speaks recklessly, favoring the strange and embellishing his words with falsehoods. His aim is to bewilder men’s minds and silence their tongues, studying alongside men like Han Tan. Han Tan was a man’s name, and together they practiced his teachings.

As the *Zhuangzi* says: "The Duke of Huan’s Gongsun Long could overpower men’s mouths but not win their hearts—such is the stubbornness of debaters." Lu comments: "His conduct follows no master, his learning stands alone without companions. Though eloquent, his words miss the mark of reason; though expansive, he has no lineage to uphold. His Way may bend men’s tongues but cannot sway their hearts." Han Tan, as the *Zhuangzi* records, was also called Huan Tuan—both names referring to the same person, their sounds being close.

Gongzi Mou’s expression changed, saying: "Why do you depict Gongsun Long’s faults so harshly? Let me hear the truth of it." His displeasure showed in his face, for he found the accusations against Long excessive and demanded proof.

Ziyu replied: "I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan. Kong Chuan was Confucius’ grandson, as the *Records of the Generations* notes, and became Long’s disciple. The word *dai* means ‘to deceive.’ It is said that a skilled archer can make the rear arrow’s tip strike the front arrow’s nock, each shot following the last without break, the arrows linking seamlessly. The first arrow hits the target, and the next still clings to the bowstring, appearing as one continuous thing. The arrows connect without interruption—when the first strikes the mark, the next strikes the first, and the one behind it still seems to cling to the string, as if all were a single, unbroken line."

Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: "This is not yet the marvel."

Yong Hongchao, a disciple of Feng Meng, grew enraged at his wife and sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow—Wuhao being the bow of the Yellow Emperor—and nocked a Qi-Wei arrow, Qi being a place renowned for fine arrows, and Wei referring to the fletching. He loosed the shaft at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not so much as flutter; the arrow fell to the ground, and not a speck of dust stirred. Though the arrow struck, its force was spent—just as the saying goes, "Even a mighty crossbow’s bolt, at its end, cannot pierce Lu gauze."

Could this truly be the words of a wise man?

Gongzi Mou replied: "The words of the wise are not something the foolish can comprehend. With this in mind, jest with Ziyu about the rear arrow striking the front nock, the later shot aligning with the earlier. When the later shot follows the earlier, there is no miss."

In recent times, there was a man who cast five dice, achieving a hundred "Lu" in a hundred throws. People marveled, believing him to possess some Dao, and reported it to Wang Yifu. Yifu said: "There is nothing extraordinary here—he simply made each later throw match the earlier one." When Yu Zisong heard this, he remarked: "Lord Wang’s words, though unassuming, grasp the principle. All such cases are of this kind."

The arrow flew toward the pupil yet the eyelid did not blink—this was the exhaustion of the arrow’s force. One who can gauge the force of bow and arrow, the measure of distance, will know whether the shot will penetrate or not, all determined by the mind and hand’s judgment. There is no fear of error.

Now, if even the clumsiest archer were to blindly shoot toward a target, the arrow would inevitably reach its limit. At that limit, not even a hair’s breadth more can be gained. By reckoning that limit, one adjusts depth according to distance.

Liu Daozhen once told Zhang Shuqi: "I once discussed this with Le Yanfu, who said this need not be the province of sages alone. Even if Confucius or Yan Hui were archers, they would surely understand this." I believe that matters of form and function are but coarse principles of the Dao. One who grasps even a part of the Way can master them fully. Just as Pao Ding wielded his blade or Carpenter Shi swung his axe—such mastery in a single craft does not require a sage.

Why doubt it?

As for aligning the later with the earlier, a hundred shots become as one, and thus appear as a single, unbroken line.

The archer whose eyes do not blink—when the arrow’s force reaches the lashes, it is already spent. Thus, not a speck of dust stirs upon the ground, for the arrow does not fall *because* it strikes the lashes. When Ziyu heard this, he saw it as one continuous motion, saying that from bowstring to target, the arrows linked in unbroken succession, as if never separate. But when he heard that an arrow could strike the pupil and yet not pierce the eye, he claimed the shot had missed its mark—this is a failure to grasp the ultimate principle, not some perverse sophistry of Gongsun Long.

Yue Zheng Ziyu said: "You, a disciple of Long, how could you not gloss over his flaws? I shall speak of his most egregious errors—errors most extreme." Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: "There is intention without mind." Yet the mind is still and thoughtless; if wayward intentions and concerns arise, the mind’s true nature is lost.

Lu said: "What moves in the mind is intention. The world knows intention but not the mind itself."

"There is pointing that does not reach." To seek arrival through pointing is to rely on the self to correct things. Relying on the self to correct things means one has not yet attained the ultimate. Only by forgetting what one relies upon can both self and other be mutually realized.

Hui Shi said: "Pointing does not reach." Lu said: "Wherever there is pointing, there is no arrival. Arrival means there is no pointing."

"There are things that cannot be exhausted." Within the realm of coarse existence, there is always *being*; at the boundary where things are exhausted, the One always remains. The One remains indivisible—though one may wish to diminish it, principle does not permit exhaustion. Only by following without diminishing, by aligning without opposing, do the towering heights of Mount Tai and the vast expanse of primordial qi merge indistinguishably into one.

Hui Shi said: "Take a one-foot staff and halve it daily—it will never be exhausted, even after ten thousand generations." Lu said: "If it could be exhausted, it would not be *being*. A one-foot staff halved daily will never be exhausted, for though the divisions grow ever finer, principle does not allow for total depletion."

"There is a shadow that does not move." Shadow arises from light; if the light does not shift, the shadow is reborn anew. All things undergo hidden transformation in this way, yet the deluded fail to perceive it—hence the analogy of the shadow.

Hui Shi said: "The shadow of a flying bird never moves." Lu said: "If it moved, the shadow would change. New shadows arise in succession, so its motion is unseen."

"A single hair can draw a thousand *jun*." Things break only where there is imbalance. Where all is balanced, nothing can break. Thus, though a hair is fine, it can lift a heavy weight—its force is perfectly even.

Lu said: "Though fine, a hair can bear many *jun*, just as individual strands may seem light, but when gathered, can snap an axle."

"White horse is not horse." This argument survives, and many have debated it. But those who debate it lack broad understanding, so I leave it unaddressed.

Lu said: "White designates color; horse designates form. 'White horse is not horse' distinguishes form from color."

"An orphaned calf has never had a mother." This meaning is not worth exposing.

Lu said: "To call it an orphaned calf—how could it have a mother? Such inverted logic defies reason beyond measure."

Gongzi Mou said: "You fail to grasp the profound and instead call it error—yet the greater error lies with you. The blame for misunderstanding returns to Ziyu. Without intention, minds are the same, united in nothingness. Without pointing, all things are reached. The mind points, and thus nothing is beyond its reach. One who seeks to exhaust things remains bound by *having*. With a mind set on exhausting things, things are never exhausted, and the mind remains burdened by possession. The shadow does not move—its explanation lies in change. The shadow changes and is reborn, not the same as before. *Mozi* says: 'The shadow does not move; its explanation lies in transformation.' A single hair draws a thousand *jun*—its force is perfectly equal. Because of this perfect equality, it does not break. Breaking arises from inequality. Thus, *Mozi* also holds this view. 'White horse is not horse'—form and name are separate. Separation means division. *The White Horse Discourse* says: 'Horse' designates form; 'white' designates color. What designates color does not designate form. How can such statements be resolved? They remain unclear. 'An orphaned calf has never had a mother'—it is not an orphaned calf. This saying verges on the vulgar and is incomprehensible."

Yue Zheng Ziyu said: "You rank Gongsun Long with the braying of horses. You claim his words are no different from a horse’s call, yet you say they have coherence. If such nonsense issued from another’s mouth, you would accept it. You resent Long’s sophistry and rage at Mou’s words, so you spew this crude and insolent language."

Gongzi Mou fell silent for a long while, then withdrew, saying: "Let me return another day to discuss this with you." His anger was still fierce, and reason could not prevail, so he retreated with these deferential words.

Lu said: "One who loses reason in anger cannot be reasoned with—hence his withdrawal."

*Zhenghe* states: "Conduct is ruined by following others—thus one desires a teacher. Learning is impoverished in isolation—thus one desires friends. Loquacity leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center. Thus, glibness misses the mark. The hundred schools and myriad arts have their uses—thus, those who ramble lack a true school. There is the archery of shooting, and the archery of not shooting. The later arrow’s head aligns with the earlier arrow’s nock, no more than a hair’s breadth behind. The arrow strikes the pupil, yet the eye does not blink—thus, it does not exceed the arrow’s force. This is the archery of shooting—what doubt remains?

Intention arises from the mind; with intention, the mind is altered. Thus, 'intention without mind'—with intention, the mind is not itself. Without intention, minds are the same. To point at a thing is to fail to reach what is not pointed at—better to have no pointing, so all things are reached. Things cannot be exhausted."

To seek to exhaust things by their presence is to remain perpetually bound to existence—thus, where things are not exhausted, the exhaustion of things is ever present.

That a shadow does not move means: whether crooked or straight, its shadow remains the same—hence, the explanation lies in transformation.

To draw a thousand *jun* with a single hair means: the accumulation of small strengths that cannot prevail becomes a great strength that prevails—thus, it is said that power reaches equilibrium.

Yet though Gongsun Long could overcome men’s speech, he could not subdue their hearts—such is the confinement of the disputatious.

*The Liezi* records this, intending to expose the obscurity of perverse doctrines.

Fan [Zuyu] said: Tradition speaks of Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk—sophists who delude men’s minds, alter their thoughts, overcome their speech, yet fail to win their hearts. Gongsun Long himself claimed that by uniting sameness and difference, separating hardness and whiteness, affirming the unaffirmable, and negating the unnegatable, he could confound the wisdom of the hundred schools and exhaust the eloquence of all disputants—such were his tens of thousands of cunning words, yet none were worthy of emulation.

Prince Mou of Zhongshan, whom Zhuangzi deemed one who aspired to the Dao but had not attained it, delighted in Gongsun Long’s ultimate doctrines. Xun Qing, in denouncing the twelve philosophers, did so for this very reason.

As for Gongsun Long’s character: he followed no teacher, kept no companions, was glib yet missed the mark, rambled without a true school, indulged in the bizarre, and spoke recklessly—all to bewilder men’s hearts and silence their speech. This is why Yuezheng Ziyu condemned him.

Observe his letter to Kong Chuan: "A skilled archer can make the later arrow’s head align with the earlier arrow’s nock—this may be called 'the arrow’s head no more than a hair’s breadth behind.' When Hong Chao shot his wife, the arrow struck her pupil yet her eye did not blink—this may be called 'not exceeding the arrow’s force.' But 'intention without mind,' 'pointing without reaching,' 'things not exhausted,' 'shadows not moving,' 'drawing a thousand *jun* with a single hair,' 'a white horse is not a horse,' 'an orphaned calf never had a mother'—these defy categories and invert principles, and there is no end to such absurdities."

Yuezheng Ziyu said: "You take Gongsun Long’s clamor to be reasoned discourse—is it not rather like the wind howling through the reeds, devoid of meaning?"

Yet Prince Mou once delighted in Gongsun Long’s character. And Zhuangzi’s account of Gongsun Long questioning Wei Mou, concluding with the analogy of the frog in the shallow well, reveals an initial admiration followed by final rejection.

Yao governed the world because the world desired governance—thus, Yao governed it.

After fifty years, Yao knew not whether the world was well-governed or not, nor whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not. For when the Dao governs things, the name of governance vanishes. Once the name of governance is extinguished, Yao does not perceive himself above things, nor do things perceive themselves below Yao. He turned and asked his attendants—his attendants knew not; he asked the outer court—the outer court knew not; he asked those in the wilds—they in the wilds knew not. Had there been any who knew, the Dao of governance would not yet have reached its perfection.

Yao then disguised himself and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing:

*"He raised us, the multitudes,
None but you set our bound.
Unknowing, unperceiving,
We follow Heaven’s decree."*

*"Multitudes"* means the many. To enable the ten thousand things all to attain their bound without violating their natural natures—is this not to follow Heaven’s Dao? If one were to regulate the natures of things through knowledge and perception, how could that accord with Heaven’s Way?

Pleased, Yao asked, *"Who taught you to say these words?"*
The children replied, *"We heard them from a grandee."*
The grandee said, *"It is an ancient poem."*

To speak of an ancient poem in the present is to make the present the same as the ancient.

Yao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the world to him. His work accomplished, he withdrew—Shun did not decline but accepted, for the moment had come and he responded.

Lu said: *"To prize one’s person while standing above the multitude is to live in constant fear of failing to command their respect. To cherish one’s person while standing above the multitude is to live in constant dread of failing to benefit things. But one who is indifferent to the world neither dominates nor abandons it, governs before disorder arises, takes without presuming honor, and relinquishes without feeling loss. Like Heaven’s revolutions, the four seasons come to be; like Earth’s bearing, the ten thousand things are born. Thus, one accomplishes the work, fulfills the task, and withdraws—this is to be without self. To be without self is to abdicate the great position without reluctance and to accept the great position without refusal."*

Zheng said: *"Yao was not someone who acted upon others, nor did he perceive others as acting upon him. Not acting upon others, he knew not whether the world was governed or not. Not perceiving others as acting upon him, he knew not whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not. When he asked his attendants, the court, and those in the wilds, and none knew, then the people were vast and nameless—such was the effect. 'He raised us, the multitudes, none but you set our bound'—this means clothing and food were sufficient, and all received the mean of their mandate. 'Unknowing, unperceiving'—this means clothing and food were sufficient, and all followed Heaven’s principle. The hundred clans called it natural—this is the governance of the highest order."*

Fan said: *"One who is intent on governing will not necessarily govern the world; only one who takes no thought for the world can govern it. One who cannot be different will not necessarily be upheld; only one who is different will be upheld. Yet I have heard of letting the world be, not of governing it—thus, whether it is governed or not, I have no concern. When the noble man must assume office, he governs by returning to non-action. The spirit-man dislikes the crowd’s arrival, for when the crowd arrives, he does not compare himself to them—thus, whether they uphold him or not, he has no concern. When the world delights in pushing him forward and does not weary of him, then those who uphold him cannot let go. Thus, though Yao reigned for fifty years, he knew not whether the world was governed or not, nor whether the myriad people wished to uphold him or not. The hundred clans called it natural—what had the emperor’s power to do with them? When he asked his attendants, the court, and those in the wilds, none could explain why it was so. Only when he wandered the broad thoroughfares and heard the children’s song did he know that 'He raised us, the multitudes, none but you set our bound,' and that 'Unknowing, unperceiving, we follow Heaven’s decree.' Was this not the ultimate governance, where all traces vanish?*

*'He raised us, the multitudes, none but you set our bound'*—the *Ode to Wen* once praised Hou Ji with these words.
*'Unknowing, unperceiving, we follow Heaven’s decree'*—the *August* once praised King Wen with these words.
Thus, *Liezi* cited this to praise Yao, simply calling it an ancient poem.

That Yao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the world to him was because he had accomplished his work and did not dwell in it. That Shun did not decline but accepted was because the moment had come and he could respond. Moreover, when Yao was emperor, he regarded the imperial yellow canopy as no concern of his; when Shun was emperor, he held the world but did not possess it. Thus, their transmission and reception had their own Dao.

Yet the records of the historians say that Yao tested Shun through trials before yielding to him, and that Shun’s virtue was elevated before he received Yao’s abdication. Alas! How could this be the true nature of Yao and Shun?

Guan Yin Xi said: *"Abiding nowhere within oneself, empty and without attachment—how could there be any fixed grasp? Things take form of themselves. That things take form is like the unfolding of affairs and principles. Affairs and principles clarify themselves—it is not my doing. In movement, it is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Moving like water—this is to move in accord with things. Still like a mirror—this is to respond without concealment. Echoing like an echo—this is to respond without leading.*

Lu said: *"The utmost of Heaven is spirit—subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating, fathomless. Seen, it cannot be seen; heard, it cannot be heard. It ever resides within oneself yet none know its abode; it shapes the ten thousand things yet cannot be perceived. In movement, it is like water, moistening the lowly and aiding the exalted; in stillness, like a mirror, reflecting without weariness; in response, like an echo, leaving nothing unanswered—this is the highest principle of nurturing spirit. Thus, the Dao is like things, yet things depart from the Dao, while the Dao does not depart from things. Those who are one with the Dao, the Dao also attains."*

Lu said: *"This utmost Dao is not a thing with form, yet it responds perfectly without omission. Thus, things depart from it, but the Dao does not depart from things."*

One who excels in the Way does not employ the ears, nor the eyes, nor strength, nor the heart-mind. Only by forgetting all that is employed does one accord with the Way. Those who seek the Way through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect will never attain it.

Lu said: *"To excel in this Way, one must dismantle the limbs, silence brilliance, empty the heart-mind, and nourish the spirit—then one naturally turns toward realization. Gazing ahead, it suddenly lies behind; employed, it fills the Six Voids; abandoned, none know its whereabouts. Does the Way have front or back, much or little? It responds wherever sought."*

Lu said: *"This Way of nourishing spirit is hard to know, hard to see—neither existent nor nonexistent. To those who gaze upon it, it precedes the ten thousand things; to those who slight it, it does not contend with things. Employed, the Six Voids are all complete; abandoned, none know where it remains. It stands alone and does not change; it circulates everywhere without exhaustion—this is its perfection. Neither those with a heart-mind can draw near, nor those without a heart-mind can draw far. To seek the Way through having or lacking a heart-mind is to misjudge distance and nearness. Only by forgetting both existence and nonexistence, front and back, does one harmonize with the Heavenly Unification."*

Lu said: *"Those who seek with a heart-mind distance themselves from the Way—it is not the Way that distances them. Those who accord with the Way without a heart-mind draw near to it—the Way itself draws near. Having or lacking a heart-mind is a human distinction; the Way is never far. Only those who silently attain it and cultivate it through nature obtain it. Those who are naturally free of artifice lose nothing. To know yet be without emotion, to be capable yet not act—this is true knowing, true capability. Knowing to the utmost is to be as if without emotion; capability to the fullest is to return to non-action."*

Lu said: *"Only those who silently illuminate within and cultivate through nature attain it. Those who know through nature must forget emotion; those who forget emotion and act not—this is true knowing, true capability. If one arises from non-knowing, how can there be emotion? If one arises from incapability, how can there be action?"*

Lu said: *"Now, arising refers to what humans cannot know—how then could there be emotion? Arising from what humans cannot do—how could there be self-generated emotion? The deluded transform nature into emotion; the wise transform emotion into nature. Thus, the *Yi* says: 'If one does not restrain emotion through nature, how can one long practice correctness?' A clod of earth, a pile of dust—this is but a dwelling. Though one acts not, it is not the principle."*

Lu said: *"The non-acting yet accomplishes all. If one remains inert like a clod or dust, though emotion is abandoned and non-action upheld, it is not the highest principle."*

*Zhenghe* states: *"The Way moves above the ten thousand things. The sage embodies the Way, circulating without accumulation, yet things cannot depart from it. Thus it is said: 'Within oneself, it has no abode; in shaping things, it is manifest.' The movement like water means flowing with things, riding their waves, moving in accord with principle. Stillness like a mirror means neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealment, still yet unchanging. Response like an echo means never initiating, only harmonizing with others—this is the Way, which responds to things without contrivance. The Way is like things, yet things grow distant from the Way—this is what is meant by 'things depart from the Way.' The Way is vast and one with things—this is what is meant by 'the Way does not depart.' Things have no beginning; to speak of the Way as audible is to hear falsely. The Way cannot be seen; to see it is to see falsely. Thus, one who excels in the Way does not employ the ears or the eyes."*

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Without place, without repose—only then is the Way settled. Without thought, without worry—only then is the Way known. Thus, one who excels in the Way does not employ strength or the heart-mind. Form, color, name, and sound are insufficient to grasp its essence. Therefore, it is said: 'Those who seek the Way through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect will never attain it.' Gazing ahead, it suddenly lies behind—this speaks of its immeasurability. Employed, it fills the Six Voids; abandoned, none know its whereabouts—this speaks of its inconstancy."*

Those who govern the Way forget the heart-mind; when the heart-mind knows nothing, this is called attainment. Those with a heart-mind and those without have not yet forgotten the heart-mind, and thus cannot attain. Only those who silently attain it and cultivate it through nature—who employ no heart-mind—can obtain it. To know yet forget emotion is to be free from the burdens of knowing—this is true knowing. To be capable yet not act is to be free from the artifice of capability—this is true capability. If one arises from non-knowing, how can there be emotion? If one arises from incapability, how can there be action?

The Way is ever non-acting yet not without action. A clod of earth, a pile of dust—though called non-acting, how can this be the Way? Thus it is said: 'Though one acts not, it is not the principle.'"

Fan said: *"To accumulate is to be insufficient; to store nothing is to have surplus. The perfected person accumulates nothing, is merely empty—thus embodying the Way within, never abiding in possession. Yet how could they constantly harbor intentions toward indiscriminate response? The manifestation in things is each receiving of itself. Thus, flowing without resistance, its movement is like water; responding without concealment, its stillness is like a mirror; harmonizing without initiating, its response is like an echo. Following things naturally, without room for selfishness—this is why the Way is like things. The Way is not far from humans; humans distance themselves from the Way. Thus it is said: 'Things depart from the Way.' Those who harmonize with the Way, the Way also attains—thus it is said: 'The Way does not depart.' One who excels in the Way does not employ the ears or eyes—if one seeks the Way through ears and eyes, though sight and hearing be detailed, they become but deafness and blindness. One does not employ the heart-mind or strength—if one seeks the Way through heart-mind and strength, though form and intellect toil, they become but exhaustion and withering."*

How then could one ever align with the Dao? Only the Dao’s movement is present everywhere. Gazing ahead, one cannot follow it; suddenly behind, one cannot meet it. Employed, it fills the six directions, pervading heaven and earth without revealing its bounds; abandoned, none know its whereabouts, entering the depths of darkness where no trace or sign may be glimpsed.

Those who distance themselves from the profound, the profound also distances itself—yet this is not something the intentional heart-mind can achieve. Those who draw near to the profound, the profound also draws near—yet this is not something the unintentional can attain. Only those who silently recognize it may grasp it; only those who follow their nature may fulfill it. The Dao within me is never lost.

Thus the ancients, knowing, forgot words—this is true knowledge, which knows all things. Acting, they did not act—this is true ability, which can do all things. As for clods of earth, heaps of dust, or obstruction by inaction—how could these be called the Dao?

*End of the Eleventh Fascicle of the Four Commentaries on the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue*
*Beginning of the Twelfth Fascicle of the Four Commentaries on the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue*

**Zhang Zhan of the Jin, Lu Chongxuan the Tang Palace Attendant, the Song *Zhenghe* Annotations, and Fan Zhixu the Left Minister of the Song—compiled by Gaoshouyuan the Radiant Scattered One**

**Tang’s Inquiry**

Zhang [Zhan] said: What wisdom knows is bounded by what it does not know. Yet the world takes its own limited vision to bound all things—thus the great sage poses questions, and those who exhaust principle respond.

Lu [Chongxuan] said: The nature of the myriad things each prizes its own life, yet knows not how to nurture what sustains it. Loving the body, they lose their lives. Thus this chapter discards form to preserve life and penetrate its essence; essence flows into nature, and nature unites with the Dao.

**Zhenghe [Annotations]:** What is above form is spirit, unfathomable; what is below form is matter, inexhaustible. Those of the world take what their ears and eyes reach to expect what lies beyond sight and hearing—how shallow!

Fan [Zhixu] said: Beyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discourse; within the six directions, the sage discourses but does not debate. Thus Tang’s questions and Ge’s answers are not easily rendered. Those of narrow vision and scant learning call the Dao shallow. Scholars of one corner, daunted by its vastness, dismiss this chapter’s discussions as absurd and fantastical, obscuring the words of the noble man—how is this different from the folly of those confined to a dried-up well?

King Tang of Yin asked Xia Ge (the character *Ge* in *Zhuangzi* is pronounced *Ji*): “Was there being in the primordial beginning?”
He replied: “It was but a boundless blur.”
Xia Ge said: “In the primordial beginning, there was no being—how could there be being now? That there is being today is because there was being in ancient times. Would it be right for later people to say there is no being now? Later ages will surely take this age as ancient, so past and present turn in a cycle. If later people were to say there is no being now, that would be wrong.”

**Zhenghe [Annotations]:** The *Book of Changes* speaks of the Supreme Polarity, which generates the Two Modes. Between heaven and earth, ancient is as present.

King Tang said: “Then is there no first or last among things?”
Xia Ge said: “The end and beginning of things have no limit. What begins may become an end, what ends may become a beginning—how can one know their order? What is now called an end may be the beginning of a thing; what is called a beginning may be its end. End and beginning follow one another, ultimately indistinguishable. Yet beyond things, before events—this I do not know.”
To say that beyond things and before events there is vast emptiness is to have nothing to say.

Lu [Chongxuan] said: Later ages will take today as ancient—how is this different from asking about ancient times today? How can there be no being? From Tang’s perspective, ancient times come first, but the beginning of things and the origin of events precede one another endlessly—this cannot be known.

**Zhenghe [Annotations]:** Without beginning or end, its limit is unknowable. Since beginning and end cannot be fixed, how can one know where before and after lie? Yet within things, though time has no fixed beginning or end, before or after, there is still measure—thus it is said: “How can one know their order?” But beyond things, before events, to exhaust what wisdom knows with what wisdom does not know is only confusion. Thus it is said: “This I do not know.”

Fan [Zhixu] said: Ran Qiu asked Confucius: “Can one know what was before heaven and earth?”
Confucius told him: “Ancient is as present.” For time moves without lingering, things pass without abiding. What was today in the past is now ancient; what is today will be ancient in the future. Then how is the future different from the present, or the present from the past? When the primal qi-mother first divided, the ten thousand kinds filled the space between. What has a beginning must have an end; what has an end must have a beginning. Beginning and end turn against each other like a ring without seam. Unless one is supremely enlightened about beginning and end, how can one know where it begins? How can one know where it ends? Yet though beginning and end have no fixed origin, the times and things within them may still be known. But as for what lies beyond things—something not a thing—or before events—something not an event—without past or present, without beginning or end, even the sage may not know it.

King Tang said: “Then do the eight directions above and below have a limit?”
Though Tang and Ge answered each other, their exchanges remained unclear to sight and hearing, so he asked again, seeking full clarity.
Ge said: “I do not know.”
It is not that he did not know, but that it cannot be known by wisdom.
Tang pressed him, and Ge said: “If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end—how can I know this? To exhaust the limitless by bounding the limited is to reason from ignorance.”
Yet beyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the endless there is no further endless. If it is called limitless, how can it have an outside? If it is called endless, how can it have a middle? What is called “no limitless” and “no endless” is truly limitless and endless. The limitless has no further limitless; the endless has no further endless. Some might say that beyond the limitless there is another limitless, or that within the endless there is another endless—thus it is reaffirmed that the limitless has no further limitless, and the endless has no further endless. From this I know that it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has a limit or an end. To know the limitless is to know all; not to know the limited is true knowledge.

**Zhenghe [Annotations]:** Within the realm, above and below, the eight directions exist; beyond the realm, above and below, the eight directions do not exist. From the perspective of being, there is limit and end; from the perspective of non-being, there is no limit or end. Thus Tang’s questions to Ge often met with “I do not know.”

Fan [Zhixu] said: The measure of things is boundless—where does one draw the line between great and small?

Seeking to exhaust the realm of the utmost greatness through the utmost smallness only leads to confusion and self-defeat. How can one easily attain knowledge of the eight directions above and below? Thus, in non-being there is no limit; the eight directions above and below do not transcend non-being. In being there is an end; the eight directions above and below have already fallen into being. From man’s perspective, one sees only its limitlessness, yet beyond this limitlessness, how could there be another limitlessness? One sees only its endlessness, yet within this endlessness, how could there be another endlessness? From this I know that it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has a limit or an end. Such is the discourse on exhausting principle.

Tang further asked: What exists beyond the four seas?
Ge replied: It is like the Central State.
*Central (齐, qí)* means the middle.

Lu said: If there is no being, how can there be limit or end? Thus the Dao pervades all—this is what is meant by "non-being." Its essence and function are both vast, not mere emptiness or nothingness.

Tang said: How do you verify this?
Ge replied: When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. If one asks about what lies east of Ying, it is still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. If one asks about what lies west of Bin, it is still like Bin. From this I know that the Four Seas, the Four Wastelands, and the Four Poles are no different.

*The meanings of the Four Seas, Four Wastes, and Four Poles are found in the* Er Ya.

Knowing that they do not differ from what lies between, then what lies between is thus. Lu said: The four directions cannot be exhausted, for all have life and death, love and hate, parents and wives, children. Thus one knows that beyond the Four Wastes and Four Poles, it is no different from within Ying and Bin—this is what is meant by "thus."

**Zhenghe:** Heaven and earth cover and bear all; the Dao makes them impartial. The four directions are boundless, without demarcation. Observing near and far, what difference is there?

Fan said: That which is at the center of heaven and earth is called the Central State; that which lies beyond is called the Four Barbarians. Though the natures of the five directions differ, and the suitability of the five lands varies, if we speak only of what exists, how is what lies beyond the Four Seas different from the Central State? Thus, east of Qi, traveling to Ying, the people are the same. Asking about what lies east of Ying, it is still like Ying—from this one may know the east extends to where the sun rises. West of Qi, traveling to Bin, the people are the same. Asking about what lies west of Bin, it is still like Bin—from this one may know the west extends to where the sun sets. Observing thus, one knows the Four Seas, Eight Wastes, and Four Poles are no different.

*Tradition says:* East to Taiyuan, west to the state of Bin, south to Puye, north to Zhuli—these are the Four Poles. Beyond the goblet bamboo to the north, west to the Queen Mother of the West—these are the Eight Wastes. The Nine Yi, Eight Di, Seven Rong, and Six Man—these are the Four Seas. Thus the great and small contain one another, without end.

That which contains the ten thousand things is like that which contains heaven and earth. That which contains the ten thousand things is heaven and earth; that which contains heaven and earth is the Great Void. It contains the ten thousand things, thus it is inexhaustible. Heaven and earth contain transformations; yin and yang receive qi; the myriad things take form in flux, succeeding one another without ceasing in one life or ending in one form—thus it is inexhaustible. It contains heaven and earth, thus it is limitless. Heaven and earth enclose the Three Luminaries and encompass the Four Seas—they are vast indeed, yet as formed and bounded things, they must have limits. To exhaust their limits, how could it not be void? Considering heaven and earth within the Great Void, they are as if existing and as if not. Thus, within the realm of bounded directions, all things compare in size and differ in quantity. Extending this to the utmost of non-being, how could it be exhausted by one heaven or bounded by one earth? Then heaven and earth and the ten thousand things mutually envelop one another, alternating as states and cities—how could one know their fullness or emptiness, measure their number? How could I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths? The Great Void is endless; heaven and earth have limits. Containing the limited within the endless, heaven is not necessarily the greatest of forms.

Thus, what Zou Yan spoke of was but what he grasped—this too is what I do not know. All things may be inferred by principle, not proven by tangible evidence. To trust only what the mind and intellect know, yet not know that knowledge has limits, is superficial understanding. To believe only what the ears and eyes perceive, yet not know that seeing and hearing have bounds, is the way of the vulgar scholar. As for the enlightened person, they dissolve the obstructions of the mind and intellect, profoundly comprehend the wondrous principles beyond wisdom, break through the barriers of seeing and hearing, and remotely grasp the forms beyond things. Those who confine their thoughts to bounded realms and follow the steps within the Six Directions will claim that all is recorded in the Three Tombs and Five Classics, that the *Guicang* is exhausted by the Four Seas and Nine Provinces. How could they know the vastness of the Great Void, the limitlessness of great and small, that heaven and earth are but a dwelling, and the ten thousand things but floating dust? All are constrained by short-sightedness in their time, dimly perishing together.

Thus Liezi expounded the ultimate words of no-inner, releasing the obstructions of the mind and intellect; proclaimed the grand song of no-outer, opening the barriers of seeing and hearing. Those who aspire to follow the wind unknowingly shed their self-importance; those bound by teachings unknowingly cast off their shackles. Thus he carved away the Confucians and Mohists, pointing directly to the great square—was this merely a love of the strange and a fondness for the extraordinary, vainly seeking grandeur? Alas! When Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou were already mocked by worldly discourse, how could you alone escape it?

Lu said: The spiritual Dao contains the ten thousand things, thus it does not exhaust the yin and yang that contain heaven and earth. Thus beyond the limitless of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things, what I do not know cannot be debated—this does not mean I know nothing at all.

Zhenghe: "Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things." That which is the mother of the ten thousand things is heaven and earth, thus it contains the ten thousand things without exhaustion. That which is the beginning of heaven and earth is the Dao, thus it contains heaven and earth without limit. Heaven and earth are but a minute thing within the void, yet the Dao envelops them—thus beyond heaven and earth there must exist something greater still.

Fan said: The small differ and are distinct, while the great covers and unites them all. Only heaven and earth can cover and bear the ten thousand forms; only the great void can embrace the six directions. Great and small contain one another—who knows how this is so? Because it contains the ten thousand things, none know its bounds; this is why what fills the space between heaven and earth is only the ten thousand things. Because it contains heaven and earth, it has never had a limit; this is why heaven and earth, though vast, are not beyond its interior. Thus heaven and earth are merely a minute thing within the void, the largest of all that has form—how could one know that beyond the formless there exists something greater still? This may be grasped in the mind, yet when put into words, it often eludes understanding. Thus heaven and earth are also things. Things have insufficiencies, which is why in ancient times Nüwa smelted the five-colored stones to mend their flaws. When yin and yang lost their measure, the three luminaries waxed and waned—thus the flaws of heaven and earth need not be in their physical form. Nüwa was a divine being, so she could refine the essence of the five constants to harmonize yin and yang, ensuring the celestial markers followed their proper sequence, without needing to patch them with material substance.

Lu said: Zhang Zhan’s commentary here is apt. She broke the legs of the giant turtle to establish the four pillars. Later, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne, and in his rage struck Mount Buzhou. Gonggong rose to power between Fuxi and Shennong, and his descendants, relying on their strength, later vied with Zhuanxu for rulership. Zhuanxu was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor. Mount Buzhou stood at the northwestern extremity. The pillar of heaven was broken, the cord of earth severed; thus heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars settled there; earth sank in the southeast, and so the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.

Lu said: To disrupt the constant order and corrupt virtue is to break the pillar of heaven and sever the cord of earth. Thus the sage knows the Way of Heaven observes excess and supplements deficiency, so the three luminaries and the hundred rivers follow their great principles.

Zhenghe: Smelting stones to mend flaws and breaking the turtle’s legs to establish the pillars—these are the ways of the sage in shaping and aiding creation. The sun, moon, and stars settle in the northwest of heaven, and the hundred rivers and floodwaters flow to the southeast of earth—such is their inherent tendency.

Fan said: The *Book of Changes* takes Qian as the yang thing and Kun as the yin thing, so heaven and earth have not yet departed from being things. Thus the ancients sometimes smelted stones to mend flaws, broke the turtle’s legs to establish pillars, or shattered the pillar of heaven and severed the cord of earth. Though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot remain whole—how then could their encompassing and shaping be without dependence? The sun, moon, and stars revolve to the left because heaven is insufficient in the northwest; the hundred rivers and floodwaters flow eastward because earth is incomplete in the southeast. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: "Heaven is insufficient in the northwest, hence the north is yin, and a person’s right ear and eye are not as keen as the left; earth is incomplete in the southeast, hence the southeast is yang, and a person’s left hand and foot are not as strong as the right." Taking the near to understand the body, the vastness of heaven and earth becomes apparent.

Tang further asked: Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and shortness? Do they have sameness and difference?

Ge said: East of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, lies a great abyss—truly a bottomless valley, as recorded in the *Classic of the Great Wilderness* and the *Odes Containing Divine Mist*, which states: "It pours eastward into the bottomless valley, its depths without end." To call it "bottomless" is merely to speak of its unfathomable depth. The preceding line says "without limit," meaning it cannot be exhausted. Even if truly bottomless, there is nothing to astonish. It is called the "Returning Gully." *Master Zhuang* refers to it as "Weilü."

All the waters of the Eight Corners and Nine Regions, the celestial streams of the Milky Way, pour into it without increase or decrease. The Eight Corners are the eight extremities; the Nine Regions, the eight directions of heaven and its center. It is said that the Celestial River flows into the sea.

Lu said: The bottomless great abyss speaks of the Dao’s inexhaustibility. The most subtle and fine, entering into the spaceless, is nothing but water. That it receives without increase or decrease is because the myriad existents are all contained within it.

Within it stand five mountains: the first is Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and encircles thirty thousand *li*, with its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, making them neighbors. Their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade; their birds and beasts, pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all flavorful—consuming them grants agelessness and immortality. The inhabitants are all of the seed of immortals and sages; those who fly between them day and night are beyond counting. Though the distance between two mountains is seventy thousand *li*, and the total span among the five is two hundred eighty thousand *li*, the number of those who travel back and forth day and night cannot be reckoned—even the swiftness of wind and clouds cannot surpass their speed.

Lu said: All things with form arise within the great Dao, adorned and embellished. Delighting in finery, they know neither aging nor death, their movements ceaseless, vanishing and appearing in an instant—without limit. Yet the roots of the five mountains have no attachment. Such mountains still float upon the sea; by this reasoning, all realms of form are lodged within the great void, thus without root or stem. They constantly rise and fall with the tides, never resting for even a moment.

Lu said: The eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body are the five roots, drifting with the waves without pause. This describes how the world is all swept along by sounds, colors, fragrances, and flavors, clinging without respite—even to the point of forgetting life and scorning death in pursuit of fame and profit, unaware of how to cease and reflect, to nurture the spirit and return to the Dao.

The immortals and sages lamented this and appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the four extremities and the abodes of the immortals and sages be lost, the Emperor commanded Yuqiang.

The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: The spirit of the Northern Culmen is named Yuqiang, and the divine turtle serves as his messenger. Fifteen giant turtles lift their heads to bear the weight. The *Li Sao* asks: "If giant turtles bear the mountains, how can they remain stable?" They take turns in three shifts, exchanging once every sixty thousand years. Thus, the five mountains stand firm and unmoving.

Lu said: Form and substance are the dwelling of spirit and illumination. If the five roots drift and lose their place of abiding, then the immortals and sages will have no dwelling. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Once receiving its completed form, it does not perish until its end." If the five roots float adrift, they follow delusion to the point of death. A life spent in vain—how can this not be lamentable? Therefore, the great sages established methods and teachings to halt this, and the five roots thereby found stability. The five dusts correspond to them, the five senses arise from them, hence the number fifteen. Through the heart they are discerned, thus the three shifts and the exchange every sixty thousand years. From this, one knows the Dao of restraining the five roots.

Yet in the land of Longbo there was a giant who, in fewer than several strides, reached the abode of the five mountains. With a single cast of his hook, he caught six turtles, bundled them together, and hastened back to his country, where he scorched their bones to divine by them. A mountain spanning ten thousand *li* in height, breadth, and circumference was borne upon the head of a single turtle, and these six turtles were drawn by a single hook. That the people of Longbo could shoulder them together and bore holes in their bones to cast lots—such a person’s form must measure over a million *li*. Compared to him, the *kun*-peng is but a gnat, flea, or gust of wind. Then what could the great void not contain?

Lu said: *Bo* means "elder," the greatest of the mighty dragons. This illustrates how, among the vulgar, craving, pride, love, greed, and indulgence become the hook that ensnares, bearing the six senses to their own gratification. Is it merely that they lose their place of abiding? They even destroy and make use of it.

Thus, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the Northern Culmen and sank into the great sea, scattering immortals and sages beyond count. Lu said: What the vulgar heart drowns in, only sensory pleasures weigh heavily. Noble and base alike are ensnared by fame and profit—hence the two mountains flowed away. Love and indulgence run deep, likened to the great sea; the wandering of the numinous consciousness cannot be fully told.

The Thearch, in great wrath—*feng* meaning "great"—diminished the land of Longbo, making it straitened, and shrank its people, making them short. By the eras of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land still measured several tens of *zhang*. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "Beyond the Eastern Sea, within the great wilderness, lies the Land of Giants." The *River Chart Jade Tablet* records: "Nine myriad *li* north of Kunlun lies the land of Longbo, where people stand forty *zhang* tall and live eighteen thousand years before death." Lu said: The great sages abhorred the harm of craving and desire, so they established laws to restrain them. As the teachings of sagely wisdom spread, that land gradually shrank. Yet even under Shennong’s governance, its people still measured several tens of *zhang*, for while humanity cannot extinguish such traits, it can only pare them away.

Fan said: Tradition speaks of a great chasm beyond the Eastern Sea—this is the chasm now called. Its depths are bottomless, matching the so-called "valley that pours eastward without end." Named the "Returning Abyss," it is the same as the "tail’s vent" that drains all. The waters of the eight extremities and nine wilds, the flow of the Celestial Han—none fail to pour into it, yet it neither swells nor diminishes. It is filled yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted, unchanging through time or measure, unaffected by quantity or flux, such is its nature.

I once examined the words of the Grand Historian: "Within the Bohai Sea lie the three divine mountains, where all immortals and the elixir of deathlessness reside. From afar, they appear like clouds. But upon approach, they recede and depart."

Shall these, then, be the so-called Five Mountains? Thus, none but the seed of immortals and sages may dwell upon them. Yet the roots of the Five Mountains had no firm anchorage, so the Thearch, fearing they would drift to the westernmost reaches, commanded the gods of Yuqiang to bear them upon the heads of giant sea-turtles. Only then did the Five Mountains stand firm and unmoving.

In the land of Longbo there lived giants, who with but a few strides reached the Five Mountains. One cast his hook and bore away six of the turtles, whereupon Mount Yuanqiao sank into the great sea, and the seed of immortals and sages were scattered and displaced. The Thearch, enraged, diminished their land and shrank their people, so that by the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the folk of that land stood but a few dozen *zhang* tall.

Is this not the "land of giants" spoken of in tradition—beyond the Eastern Sea, within the Great Wilderness? From the Central States, forty thousand *li* eastward lies the land of Jiao Yao, whose people stand but a foot and a half tall. This is recorded in the *Poems Containing the Divine Mist*. In the far northeast there are beings called the Contentious Folk, who measure but nine inches. They are mentioned in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. The *Poems Containing the Divine Mist* also states: "In the far northeast dwell such people." Having spoken of the great, it thus clarifies the small.

Fan remarks: The Five Mountains rest upon the heads of giant turtles, and a single hook of the Longbo giant could lift them—thus are the vastness of things made plain. The people of Jiao Yao are short, standing but a foot and a half; the Contentious Folk of the northeast measure but nine inches—thus are the minuteness of things made plain. The sage observes from afar and from near, so that the small is not deemed insignificant, nor the great excessive. How, then, can one know that the tip of a hair suffices to define the limit of the finest? And how can one know that heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the greatest?

South of Jing lies the Dark Numinous, for whom five hundred years make a spring, and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Camphor, for whom eight thousand years made a spring, and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow fungi and mushrooms that sprout at dawn and perish by dusk. In the months of spring and summer there are midges that arise with the rain and die at the sight of the sun.

Lu says: If one harbors desires and loses their true nature, then what difference is there between the great of form and the small, the long-lived and the short-lived? Thus, whether one ascends to the heights of divine immortals or descends to the level of ants, to lose the true and forsake the Way, to be driven by the passions—this loss is one and the same.

Fan says: The Dark Numinous and the Great Camphor are what Zhuangzi called the "great years." The fungi and midges are what he called the "small years." Time has its durations, number its quantities. To awaken to this and yet remain unfathomable—distant yet not perplexed, grasping yet not straining—why then should the common folk trouble themselves with knowing Pengzu as long-lived and comparing themselves to him?

At the northernmost reaches of the northern lands, as Zhuangzi says, "beyond the farthest growth," lies the Dark Sea, the Celestial Pool. There dwells a fish, thousands of *li* in breadth, its length commensurate, called the Kun. There is also a bird, called the Peng, whose wings are like clouds trailing from the sky, its body commensurate. As Zhuangzi says: "The Kun transforms into the Peng." Yet how could the world know of such creatures? They amuse themselves with what they commonly see, grow accustomed to what they commonly hear—even if told of these things, they would still disbelieve.

Great Yu beheld them in his travels, Boyi knew and named them, and the sage Yijian heard and recorded them. Strange sights and wondrous tales are met with doubt by the multitude. Yet how could Yu, Boyi, and Jian have merely spun empty words of marvels to startle their age? Rather, they made plain that such creatures exist, to dispel the stubborn narrowness of those who cling to their views, and to remove the blindness and deafness of those who perceive and hear.

Though Yijian’s name is not widely known, he was one of the ancients well-versed in the myriad things.

Fan says: Scaled creatures blaze below, able to dive but not to fly. The Kun is the diver, bound to the yin. Feathered creatures soar above, able to fly but not to dive. The Peng is the flier, bound to the yang. Though vast, the Kun and Peng are still confined to the categories of yin and yang. The vulgar scholars of the world, constrained by what lies near to their ears and eyes, thus deem such creatures nonexistent—how then could they know of that which is without limit or end?

Thus, Liezi must attribute his words to figures like Great Yu, Boyi, and Yijian, for his account is rooted in antiquity, not merely spun as empty words to startle the age.

Between the riverbanks there breeds a tiny creature, so minute it is called the Jiao Ming. They gather in swarms upon the eyelashes of mosquitoes, yet never collide. They alight and depart, and the mosquito remains unaware. Li Zhu and Zi Yu, even as they wiped their eyes and raised their brows to gaze by day, could not discern their forms. Li Zhu, a man of keen sight in the time of the Yellow Thearch, could see the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces. Zi Yu’s identity is unknown. Chi Yu and Shi Kuang, even as they pricked their ears and bent their heads to listen by night, could not catch their sound. Chi Yu’s identity is unknown. Shi Kuang lived in the time of Duke Ping of Jin; Xia Ge had no reason to mention him, so later writers embellished the account.

Those who rely on the mind’s intelligence and depend on the ears and eyes for seeing and hearing cannot perceive the most minute of things. Only when the Yellow Thearch and Rong Chengzi dwelt upon Kongtong, fasting together for three months, their hearts dead and their forms abandoned—what is called "the heart like dead ashes, the form like withered wood"—did they slowly begin to see with the spirit...

The spirit is but silent, darkly illuminating—no need for the eyes. Suddenly one sees it, vast as the slopes of Mount Song; yet to bring form into the realm of spirit is like comparing Mount Song to its true immensity. Slowly one listens with qi—qi follows its natural course, not relying on external use. Suddenly one hears it, resounding like thunder; yet to bring sound into the domain of emptiness is like comparing thunder to its true vastness.

Lu said: If there be the obstruction of form and sound, then piled earth becomes mountains, swarming mosquitoes become thunder—suddenly one sees it, suddenly one hears it, and there is nothing strange in this.

Fan said: Li Zhu and Zi Yu, men of keen sight in ancient times, could see only what had form; beyond form, there was nothing they could perceive. Chi Yu and Shi Kuang, men of sharp hearing in ancient times, could hear only what had sound; beyond sound, there was nothing they could detect. Only the Yellow Thearch and Rong Chengzi, dwelling upon Kongtong, fasting for three months, their hearts like dead ashes, their spirits congealed, their forms like withered wood, their countenances still—seeing with spirit rather than eyes, listening with qi rather than ears—then between the riverbanks, swarms of midges gathered. Before, Li Zhu and Zi Yu, even as they wiped their eyes and raised their brows by day, could not perceive their forms; now, suddenly, they saw them as vast as Mount Song. Before, Chi Yu and Shi Kuang, even as they pricked their ears and bent their heads by night, could not catch their sound; now, suddenly, they heard it resounding like thunder. Who can fathom the principle behind the minute and the vast?

Moreover, from the perspective of ordinary people, the leviathan and the tiny insect are so far apart that their difference cannot be expressed in words. Yet from the boundless, limitless vantage, both are but things—what superiority is there between them?

In the lands of Wu and Chu, there is a great tree called *you* (sounding like "pomelo"). Its leaves are jade-green, and it bears fruit in winter; its berries are crimson and sour. Drinking its sap cures the illness of oppression. The people of the Central States prize it, yet when it crosses the Huai River to the north, it transforms into the trifoliate orange. The myna does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon dog dies if it crosses the Wen River—such is the influence of the earth’s qi. Though this matter is also recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*, the forms and qi differ, yet their natures remain the same. They do not change one another; all life is complete, all portions are sufficient.

How am I to know the great from the small? How am I to know the long from the short? How am I to know the same from the different? The ten thousand kinds, ten thousand forms, ten thousand natures, ten thousand dispositions—each rests in what it knows, following without grasping, then all are equal in completeness and sufficiency, without desire to change one another. Can this be discerned by wisdom?

Lu said: What is born of yin and yang, what suits the land, what connects with spirit and qi, what is altered by habit and influence—all are like this. What is there to debate?

*Zhenghe* commentary: The great and small belong to form; the long and short belong to number. With form and number, the names of sameness and difference are established. Beyond the four directions, within the six directions, there are ten thousand differences—who knows their limit? Yu the Great and Bo Yi named what they saw, yet this still lay within the realm of ears, eyes, heart, and knowledge. The Yellow Thearch and Rong Chengzi, seeing with spirit and listening with qi, had already transcended into the subtle, mysterious, and penetrating. Those who behold the Dao do not follow what is abandoned, nor trace what arises. All natures are equal, all lives are complete, all portions are sufficient. Knowing this alone, why must one discern where the great and small, the long and short, the same and different come to rest?

Fan said: The *Artificers’ Record* states: "The orange crosses the Huai to the north and becomes the trifoliate orange; the myna does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon dog dies if it crosses the Wen River—such is the earth’s qi." Its words are based on this. Things born between heaven and earth vary in fullness and emptiness, in growth and decline, in qi; yet the natures they are endowed with are natural and cannot be altered. All life is complete, without the slightest deficiency; all portions are sufficient, without the slightest lack. The great and small, the long and short, the same and different—awake or obscure, there is no boasting, so why must one seek knowledge of these?

The meaning of *Zhuangzi*’s "Free and Easy Wandering" accords with this.

The two mountains, Taihang and Wangwu—*Taihang* should read *Taihang* (the Taihang Mountains are in Heyang County, Henan; Wangwu is in Dongyuan County, Hedong)—span seven hundred *li* and rise ten thousand *ren*. They originally lay south of Jizhou and north of the Yellow River. There was an old man of the Northern Mountains, called the Foolish Old Man—though he was called foolish, he was not necessarily unwise. Nearly ninety years of age, he lived facing the mountains.

Lu said: *Cheng* (惩), pronounced *chí gāng*.

"Cheng" means caution, wound, or governance. The mountains blocked the north, making all journeys circuitous. He gathered his household to consult, saying: "I and you shall join our strength to level the perilous terrain, opening a path south to Yu and reaching the southern bank of the Han—would this be acceptable?" They all assented in unison. *Za* means "the rest."

His wife raised a doubt—*xiànyí* means to present a difficulty—and said: "With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuifu; what can you do to Taihang and Wangwu? Kuifu is a small hill, located in the borders of Chenliu. Moreover, where will you put the earth and stones?"

They replied in unison: "Cast them into the far reaches of the Bohai Sea, north of the Hidden Land." *Huainanzi* states: "The prefecture obtained in the northeast is called the Hidden Land."

Thereupon, he led his children and grandchildren—three men able to bear the load—striking stones and breaking soil, transporting them with baskets to the far reaches of the Bohai Sea. The widow of a neighbor from the Jingcheng clan—a widow is a woman without a husband—had an orphaned boy who had just lost his milk teeth; he leapt forth to assist them. As the seasons changed, they had only just made one return trip.

The Wise Old Man of the River Bend laughed and tried to stop them—those commonly called wise are not necessarily unwise—and said: "How extreme is your lack of wisdom!"

With his remaining years and waning strength, how could he harm so much as a single blade of grass upon the mountain—what then of its earth and stones?

The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain sighed deeply: "Your heart is so obstinate, so utterly impervious—you are not even the equal of a widow or a frail child. Though I should die, my son remains. My son will beget a grandson, my grandson will beget a son, and that son will beget yet another son. Sons beget sons, grandsons beget grandsons, without end or exhaustion. Yet the mountain will not grow—why then should we not level it?"

The Wise Old Man of the River Bend had no reply. He yielded in reason but submitted to the other’s resolve.

The Spirit Who Grasps the Serpent, hearing of this—*The Classic of Great Wilderness* states: "The spirits of mountains and seas all grasp serpents"—feared that the old man would not cease. If he did not cease, the mountains would surely be leveled.

The world knows well that small accumulations can build great heights, yet fails to grasp that great losses can dwindle to near nothing. The nine-tiered tower rises from heaped earth; the lofty bank becomes a hidden ravine. If effort is never abandoned, if one does not demand instant results, then no trifle will fail to accumulate, no vastness will fail to diminish. Now, when whetstone and blade grind ceaselessly against each other, one knows they will eventually wear away. If two things are thus, then hills and valleys must likewise shift—there is no cause for doubt. Those who are confounded by questions of scale or speed have simply failed to extend the principle.

He reported the matter to the Emperor. Moved by the old man’s sincerity—touched by the depth of the Foolish Old Man’s devotion—the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu. (Kuafu is unrecorded in the annals; he must have been a being of divine strength.) They bore the two mountains away, placing one in the northeast, the other south of Yong. From that time on, south of Ji and north of the Han River, there were no more obstructing ridges.

Those who seek merit in a single morning or evening will resort to deceit upon hearing the year’s end draw near; those who covet beauty in their own time will grieve endlessly after their death. Such is the shallow mind of the common man, the ordinary sentiment of a single generation. As for the great person, they take heaven and earth as a single dawn, myriad ages as a fleeting instant, act with utter forgetfulness, and achieve without deliberate intent. Whether it lies with me or with another, whether it belongs to this life or to others, they perceive no distinction, nor do they know what comes before or after. Thus, the Foolish Man of North Mountain and the widowed wife’s orphan are enough to mock the cunning of Hequ and deride the delusions of an entire age. O you aimless multitudes—can you not reflect upon this?

Lu says: This chapter is an *xing*. The vulgar follow what they are accustomed to and conform to the crowd; what the crowd deems right, they take as right. Though entangled in desires from birth to death, living in ceaseless drift and dying without knowing their destination, the foolish toil endlessly for food and clothing until their end, while the gentleman toils endlessly for fame and form until his death—both believe they are content with fate, as it has ever been. Yet the one who attains the highest learning must seek the Dao, forget life, and merge with the real. Upon hearing the Way, they act without regard for age; if they exhaust life without hearing it, their spirit may yet be moved to spontaneous understanding. Thus the *Yijing* says: "Abiding in stillness, yet when stimulated, they penetrate all." Only then can the hindrances of form be forgotten, and the principle of perfect equilibrium flow unimpeded.

*Zhenghe* says: To level the perilous and make it passable is to remove the obstruction of form. That the Emperor was moved by sincerity is to reach the wondrous realm beyond form. The old man of Hequ was shackled by the finitude of form and unaware of the Dao’s boundlessness; in his cleverness, he mocked the foolish, never realizing that pure, unadulterated foolishness is the greatest wisdom.

Fan says: The trickle from a cliff’s edge bores through stone; a single strand of hemp severs a tree trunk. Water is not a drill for stone, nor is rope a saw for wood—yet they wear away by ceaseless effort. The one who embodies the Dao discerns this principle clearly, taking ancient and modern as a single breath, life and death as a single thread. With steadfast resolve, they act without expecting results in an instant; with unwavering sincerity, they seek no merit within the span of a year. How could they ever deem worldly affairs difficult? Thus, the two mountains of Taihang and Wangwu stood south of Jizhou and north of Heyang, spanning seven hundred *li*, towering ten thousand *ren*—truly high and vast. Yet they had not transcended form and measure, and so could be leveled. The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain, nearly ninety years of age, dwelt facing the mountains. Vexed by the blockage to the north and the circuitous paths of his comings and goings, he gathered his clan to deliberate. With all their strength, they set about leveling the perilous heights. Shouldering baskets and wicker hampers, they carried earth and stone, dumping them north of Yintu and at the edge of the Bohai Sea—truly a distant removal. Some approved with a chorus of voices, while young boys just losing their baby teeth came to help. Those who raised doubts were not heeded; those who laughed and tried to stop them were ignored.

With descendants endless in number, leveling earth and stone that would never increase—such perseverance might well endure forever. His unceasing toil, thus carried to its end, moved even the Spirit Who Grasps the Serpent, who in turn stirred the son of Kuafu. Their strength bore the peril of the two mountains, smoothing the way so that no ridges remained to block the ascent. Ah! What seemed folly yet reached the height of wisdom—is this not the very essence of the Foolish Old Man?

*The Perfect Dao and Its Power: True Classic with Four Commentaries, Scroll Thirteen*

**Tang’s Questions**

Kuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow, pursuing it to the edge of Yu Valley. Yu Valley is Yuyuan, where the sun sets. Thirsting for drink, he rushed to the Yellow River and the Wei. When the Yellow River and the Wei proved insufficient, he set out northward to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he arrived, he perished of thirst along the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his corpse’s fat and flesh soaked the earth, Deng Forest grew. Deng Forest spread wide, spanning thousands of *li*.

*The Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: “Kuafu died, discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest.”

Lu says: When one arrives at the Dao with a single-minded resolve, one departs with a bond to the Real. Yet if one relies on ability to seek victory, one chases shadows and never catches them. In attaining the Real, all forms are leveled; in pursuing the superficial, one loses life and leaves only traces. The traces’ manifestation gave rise to Deng Forest; the bond to the Real leveled hills and ridges.

Zhenghe: Transformations and shifts proceed without end—who can fathom their limits? The Zheng man’s autumn cypress, Kuafu’s birth of Deng Forest—do these not arise from some hidden mechanism, some inevitability?

Fan says: Tradition holds that Kuafu died, discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest—this is the very Kuafu in question. Chasing the sun to the edge of Yu Valley, rushing to drink between the Yellow River and the Wei, he finally set out northward for the Great Marsh, only to die before arriving. Was this not the consequence of burdening himself excessively, failing to measure his own strength?

Great Yu declared: Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, illumination comes from the sun and moon, alignment from the stars, order from the four seasons, and summation from the Great Year. What the divine and numinous engender assumes diverse forms—some perish young, some live long—only the sage can fathom their Way.

The sage follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth, accords with the nature of the myriad things, allows each to find its place, and harmonizes their reversals and sequences, so that all differences find their proper measure and all lives, long or short, fulfill their allotted span.

Zhenghe: The sun and moon possess radiance, hence "illumination"; the stars form ranks, hence "alignment"; the four seasons proceed in sequence, hence "order"; the Great Year encompasses all, hence "summation." "What the divine and numinous engender" refers to what Heaven and Earth bring forth—Heaven as divine, Earth as numinous. The myriad things assume diverse forms, some perishing young, some living long. The sage roams the beginning and end of all things and penetrates their origins, thus it is said: only the sage can fathom their Way.

Xia Ge replied: Yet there are things that arise without relying on the divine or numinous, take form without depending on yin and yang, and shine without awaiting the sun and moon. That which lives lives of itself; that which takes form forms of itself; that which shines shines of itself—suddenly, spontaneously, inherently without cause or reliance. They perish young without awaiting violence, live long without awaiting nurture; those that perish young do so not through misfortune, those that live long do so not through care. They eat without relying on the five grains, clothe themselves without awaiting silk or floss, travel without awaiting boats or carriages—their Way is spontaneous. The spontaneous requires no reliance whatsoever. This is not what the sage can fathom.

The sage does not contravene the spontaneous, and the myriad things move of themselves—how could he delight in fathoming things? All the passages above were Xia Ge’s counsel to Tang of Yin.

Lu said: The beings that move and take form each have their proper place; the sage can follow their arising to fathom their Way. Yet the numinous consciousness is utterly transcendent, requiring nothing, not nurtured by the host of beings—it moves of itself, spontaneously. How could the sage fathom it?

Zhenghe: Beyond the Six Directions, the sage preserves without discussing—how could he fathom each and every thing? Is it not that which arises without reliance? Who knows why it is so? Allowing things to be spontaneous, leaving them to themselves—this is to delight in fathoming things, not the sage’s way.

Fan said: What Great Yu spoke of remained within the bounds of limits and ends; what Xia Ge spoke of reached beyond the boundless and endless. Thus one says: only the sage can fathom their Way; another says: this is not what the sage can fathom. In general, whether beyond things or within them, where do we see their difference?

When Yu governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed, leading an entire state astray. Those who wander beyond the farthest bounds are beyond the reach of deliberate thought, hence his words were those of one lost and mistaken. North of the Northern Sea, how many thousands of *li* distant from the Central States? "Distant" means "remote." That land is called Zhongbei.

Lu said: Zhongbei signifies the utmost depths of the obscure and subtle, a realm of profound stillness. Its boundaries and limits are unknown. No wind or rain, frost or dew arise there; no birds or beasts, insects or fish, grasses or trees are born.

The four directions are all level, encircled by towering heights—these are the layered ridges of mountains. Lu says: In this realm of profound stillness, without boundaries or limits, where wind and rain, birds and beasts, and all moving things cannot reach, there is only perfect flatness. The lofty land is but a hindrance of form and vessel.

At the center of the land stands a mountain named Huling, shaped like a *dan* (an earthen jar). Its peak has an opening, resembling a ring, called Zixue. Water gushes forth from it, named the Divine Spring—*fèn* refers to a mountain’s summit spring. Its fragrance surpasses orchid and pepper, its taste surpasses unstrained wine. Lu says: The mountain symbolizes the mind, while water serves as the function of wisdom, for it is the Dao’s divine spring that wells forth.

A single source divides into four channels, flowing down the mountain. The watercourses on the mountain are called *lie*. They nourish the entire land, reaching everywhere without exception. Lu says: They flow through the four limbs, permeating the hundred parts of the body, thus encompassing all forms and vessels.

The earth’s *qi* is harmonious, free from plague or pestilence. The people’s nature is gentle and yielding, following things without contention; their hearts are soft and their bones weak, neither arrogant nor envious. Young and old dwell together without rulers or subjects; men and women mingle freely without matchmakers or betrothals. They dwell along the water without plowing or sowing. The earth’s *qi* is warm and agreeable, so they know neither knowledge nor clothing. They live a hundred years without premature death or illness. Their people multiply without count, knowing only joy and happiness, free from aging, sorrow, or suffering. Lu says: The hundred bones and nine orifices respond to affairs as they are used.

They neither contend nor compete, nor boast or vaunt; embracing both yin and yang, they move with the turning of the seasons.

The Dao there is utterly yielding—no clothing, no food—neither aging nor death pursues them, neither short nor long life constrains them. The highest adept who diligently seeks it will reach that land.

Their custom delights in sound: hand in hand they take turns singing, their voices ceaseless all day. When hungry or weary, they drink the divine spring; their strength and will remain harmonious and peaceful. If they overindulge, they become intoxicated, and only after ten days do they awaken. Bathing in the divine spring, their skin glows with luster, their fragrance lingering for ten days.

Lu says: Humans live by *qi*, hence their love of sound. Their breath flows in and out without cease, thus their voices never falter. Drinking and eating with true wisdom, free from stray thoughts, they become intoxicated. When thoughts arise, they immerse themselves again, hence their radiant fragrance.

*Zhenghe* says: This land is one of delusion, showing it is not a realm the sage can fathom. Without knowing the boundaries that align and limit, there are depths within the six directions that cannot be exhausted. The *Book of Changes* says: "What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the divine."

In the heavens above, there is no wind, rain, frost, or dew; on the earth below, there are no birds, beasts, grasses, or trees. The people drink the divine spring and bathe in it, thereby sating hunger and weariness, nourishing their skin, preserving life, and fulfilling their years. This is called the divine spring—it is what makes them unfathomable.

King Mu of Zhou traveled north and passed through this land, remaining for three years before remembering to return. Once back in the Zhou court, he longed for that country and was lost in melancholy.

They consumed no wine or meat and summoned no concubines or attendants, and only after several months did they recover. Lu said: King Mu of Zhou had indeed once reached that land, yet could not remain there permanently, hence it is said they "recovered" thereafter. Fan said: When the House of Si regulated the waters and lands, their influence extended far, yet there were remote corners and foreign realms beyond the reach of human footsteps. Thus, this is spoken in allegory of delusion.

North of the northern sea, beyond countless thousands of miles from the Central States, its distance from mankind is vast indeed. The land is called Zhongbei, for it is the place where all return to the root and restore their mandate. Without knowing the boundaries that align and limit, one wanders through an expanse of boundless wilderness. Without wind, rain, frost, or dew, the qi of yin and yang do not intermingle. Without the birth of birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees, the myriad scattered kinds do not flourish. The land is level in all four directions, flat and never sloping. Encircling it are towering ridges, so high they cannot be surmounted.

Within the land stands a mountain, and at its summit lies an opening from which water gushes forth, called the divine spring—this is what the tradition refers to as "the great outflow beneath the tail." A single source divides into four streams, flowing down the mountainside, just as the tradition speaks of "water beneath the mountain." It circulates throughout the land, reaching every part without exception, thus illustrating its pervasive flow and beneficent nourishment of all things.

For this reason, the land knows no plagues or afflictions, and all beings are free from blemish or blight. Those who are gentle and compliant harbor no competitive impulses; those who are soft and tranquil exhibit no arrogance or envy. Without rulers or subjects, there is no hierarchy of elder and younger; without matchmakers or betrothals, there is no distinction between male and female. They dwell along the water, needing no grains to eat; the earth’s qi is warm and agreeable, requiring no silk or wadding for clothing. They dwell in the realm of benevolence and longevity, free from the suffering of premature death.

Drinking the divine spring, their strength and will become harmonious and balanced, as though their minds and wisdom were cleansed and opened. Bathing in the divine spring, their skin becomes sleek and lustrous, as though all dust and grime were washed away by goodness.

King Mu of Zhou traveled north and passed through this land, remaining for three years before remembering to return. Once back in the Zhou court, he longed for that country and was lost in melancholy.

After several months, he at last recovered. Such is the state of one who has yet to fully attain the Dao.

Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to journey to Liaokou, intending to reach that land together, nearly succeeding in their quest. Lu observed: Guan Zhong could describe its location—hence the phrase "journey to Liaokou"—yet though they wished to go, they could not arrive, thus "nearly succeeding."

Xi Peng remonstrated: "My lord, why forsake the vastness of Qi, its teeming populace, its majestic mountains and rivers, its abundance of resources, its flourishing rites and virtues, its splendid robes and ornaments? Your court overflows with beauty and grace, your halls brim with loyalty and wisdom. With a single shout, a million soldiers stand ready; with a mere gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why then covet that land and abandon Qi’s altars of soil and grain to follow barbarian ways?"

Lu remarked: "The words of worldly gentlemen concern only populace, rites, robes, and sensual pleasures—these they deem noble and worthy of desire."

Duke Huan desisted and relayed Xi Peng’s words to Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong replied: "This is truly beyond Peng’s understanding. His knowledge extends only to Qi; how could he grasp the grandeur of that land?" He mocked Peng: "I fear that land is beyond comprehension. Why cling to Qi’s wealth? Why heed Peng’s words? That land cannot be attained in life—would I halt for Peng’s sake?"

Lu explained: "Xi Peng’s understanding does not reach so far. Guan Zhong said: From what I have heard, I only fear it may not match the legends. Thus he said, 'I fear it is unknowable.' If the reality matches the tales, and one could journey there, then why cling to worldly wealth and glory? Why regard rites, virtue, or loyalty?"

*Zhenghe* states: Where does the Dao not reside? It is present in nothingness and in being alike. Free the mind and release the form, and neither nothingness nor being is obscured; toil the body and rest the mind is to cling to being and abandon nothingness. The sage, in relation to the Dao, embraces both presence and absence, perceiving the subtle and the manifest together—thus nothing is beyond reach. Those who cling to a state’s riches are far from the Dao, yet those who forsake their diverse people to yearn for an unfathomable land—how can they attain the Dao? King Mu’s intent, Guan Zhong’s words, and Xi Peng’s admonitions—none of these grasped the truth.

Fan observed: "Xi Peng was a man who forgot both high and low, ashamed to fall short of the Yellow Emperor yet pitying those beneath him. In governing the state, he heard nothing amiss; in managing his household, he saw nothing awry. Did Guan Zhong truly entrust the state to such a man? Yet his wisdom sufficed only to govern Qi. Thus, in the end, he opposed the northern journey and remonstrated against it."

This discourse contrasts those like Yu the Great, who deeply attained the Dao, with King Mu, who reached its shores yet turned back, and Duke Huan, who merely glimpsed the Dao from afar without ever beholding it.

The people of the southern lands wear their hair loose and go bare; the northerners don fur-lined robes and wrap their heads in felt. The Central States’ people wear caps and robes. The nine lands sustain themselves variously—some by farming, some by trade, some by hunting, some by fishing. Like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land, these arise naturally, shaped by nature itself.

The resources of each region emerge from its inherent capacity. The people of Wu and Yue use boats, while those of Yan and Shuo ride horses, adapting to the suitability of water or land without need of learning from the wise. Shen Dao said: "Those who control water build dikes and clear blockages—even among distant tribes, the method is uniform. They learn from water itself, not from Yu."

*Zhenghe* states: The southern climate is hot, so its people wear their hair loose and go bare, as in the *Book of Islands*’ "barbarians clad in grass." The northern climate is cold, so its people wrap their heads in felt and wear furs, as in the *Book of Islands*’ "barbarians clad in hides." The Central States, called Xia, are civilized and grand, donning caps and robes, practicing refined rites. The nine lands’ resources—farming, trade, hunting, fishing—along with winter furs and summer linen, are all prepared by the labor of a single body and the work of a hundred craftsmen. Yet all arise silently, shaped by nature, differing only in suitability.

Fan observed: "The southerners’ loose hair, the northerners’ felt wraps, the Central States’ caps and robes—these are differences of custom. The nine lands’ varied livelihoods—farming, trade, hunting, fishing—reflect differences in skill. Winter furs and summer linen suit different needs; boats and carts serve different purposes. Such things arise naturally and cannot be altered. Who knows their origins? They emerge silently, shaped by nature alone."

To the east of Yue lies the state of Zhexiou, where the eldest son is slaughtered and eaten at birth, deemed "fitting for younger brothers." When the grandfather dies, his widow is carried away and abandoned, for "a ghost’s wife cannot dwell with the living." South of Chu lies the land of the Yan people, where upon a relative’s death, the flesh is carved and discarded before the bones are buried—only then is one called a filial son. West of Qin lie the states of Yiqu and Kang, where the dead are heaped with firewood and burned. The rising smoke is called "ascending to distant realms," and only then is one deemed filial. Such practices are enforced as governance above and adopted as custom below, yet they are scarcely deemed strange. These accounts also appear in the *Mozi*.

Lu observed: "What the multitude deems right becomes correct; what the multitude practices becomes normal. Thus, the most correct and most common things go unquestioned. Those bound by custom are many—how could they know the ultimate principle?"

Zhenghe remarked: "East of Yue, south of Chu, west of Qin—where rites are absent above and learning is absent below—such acts are still enforced as governance and practiced as custom. These are perversions of human relations, unworthy of instruction."

Fan said: "East of Yue, south of Chu, west of Qin—all are distant, alien lands beyond mutual reach. Thus, what is enforced as governance above and practiced as custom below may differ in ways beyond comparison. Confucius, traveling east, encountered two children arguing and asked the reason. One child said: 'I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon.' The other insisted the sun was farther at dawn and nearer at noon. The first child argued: 'At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but at noon, it is no bigger than a plate—is this not proof that what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?' The second child countered: 'At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but at noon, it burns like boiling water—is this not proof that what is near is hot, and what is far is cool?' Confucius could not decide. The two children laughed: 'Who says you know so much?'

What lies beyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss. The two children’s mockery may not have missed this point—they may have been testing each other. Lu said: 'The sage’s life values the illumination of the Dao. When successful, they aid all under heaven; when obstructed, they cultivate themselves alone. Cultivating alone means nurturing the Dao to preserve authenticity; aiding all means establishing teachings to benefit others. If advancement does not fulfill the Dao and retreat does not benefit life, such one-sided debates are why the sage does not engage. Not deciding is not the same as not knowing. The world assumes that asking without knowing is ignorance, but the sage refrains from debating what is unprofitable. If every matter—whether reasonable or not—were debated, the sage’s labor would indeed be endless. Yet the children’s dispute can be clarified: at dawn, the sun’s light is not yet far-reaching, and people stand beyond its glow, seeing it as large. At noon, the light fills all things, and people stand within its brilliance, seeing its true form. It is like gazing at a candle’s flame from afar—it appears larger, but up close, the flame itself is small. Such is the principle of things—what is gained by debating it?'

Fan said: 'The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches. In its roundness, it does not depart from form; in its singular circuit, it does not depart from measure. Once bound by form and measure, distance—near or far—can be calculated. Yet Confucius could not decide—was it truly beyond his ability? Or did he simply acknowledge it without discussion? Balance is the ultimate principle of all under heaven. When every thing and every affair is level and equal, the principle is fully realized. This applies even to material objects. "Connected" means attached—what is attached to implements must also be balanced. When hair is evenly drawn and evenly suspended, it snaps under the slightest weight due to imbalance. Yet if the hair is extremely fine and delicate but does not break, it is because of perfect balance. What snaps now does so because of imbalance—like a scale tipped by unequal weight. If balanced, how could it break? It would never snap. Some dismiss this, but those who grasp the principle know it to be so. There are those who understand this truth. The *Mozi* also records this idea.'

Lu said: 'The ultimate principle is such that all under heaven is naturally balanced, not requiring adjustment to be so. Material things are the same—when aligned with principle, they are naturally balanced. Like hair suspending a weight: though fine, it does not break. What breaks is unbalanced; what is balanced does not break. The world may deny this, but they do not know the necessity of principle.'

Zhenghe said: 'The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao. The benevolent see it as benevolence; the wise see it as wisdom. The radiant light of the sun and moon appears differently to every eye. Judging by form, one assumes what is far is small and what is near is large; judging by qi, one assumes what is near is hot and what is far is cool. Yet the sun itself cannot be measured by near or far.'

Fan said: 'Hair lifting a thousand jun—this is the power of equal force. The principle aligns with this.' Zhan He..."

Jen Ho, a man of Chu, was renowned throughout the kingdom for his skill in angling. He used a single silkworm’s thread for his line, a needle’s barb for his hook, a stalk of thistle for his rod, and a split grain for his bait—yet drew forth fish as large as a cart. As the *Family Sayings* states: "The kun-fish is so vast it fills a carriage." In the swirling currents of a hundred-fathom abyss, his line never snapped, his hook never straightened, his rod never bent.

He adorned his bait with fragrance, dangled his delicate hook, sank it into the dark silt, and rode the churning waves. Following the water’s flow, he cast and retrieved, rising and falling with the current. Only when the fish had fully taken the bait did he strike, thus capturing it alive.

The King of Chu, hearing of this, found it extraordinary and summoned Jen Ho to ask the reason. Jen Ho replied: "I once heard my late master speak of Pu Juzǐ’s archery. Pu Juzǐ was a master archer of old. With a supple bow and fine cord, he rode the wind and loosed his arrow, bringing down two cormorants amid the azure clouds. His mind was single, his movements perfectly balanced. I took his method as my model and applied it to angling, studying for five years before mastering its principles.

When I stand by the river with rod in hand, my mind is free of distractions, fixed solely on the fish. Casting my line and sinking my hook, I feel no weight, and nothing can disturb my focus. The fish see my bait as mere drifting dust or foam, swallowing it without hesitation. Thus I am able to subdue the strong with the weak, and draw the heavy with the light.

If Your Majesty could govern the state with such skill, the world could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?"

The King of Chu said: "Well said." He approved of this analogy, using it to admonish his approach to governance.

Lu said: "When the sage orders the customs of the world, he must first examine the nature of all things and establish teachings to guide them. Then the people go about their daily lives unaware, effortlessly responding to his influence. It is like the supple bow and fine cord riding the wind, or the light hook and delicate bait moving with the waves—nothing can escape being mastered.

The Daoist nurtures life, preserves authenticity, and embraces all beings, drawing them naturally toward transformation. Thus, governing the world follows the same principle.

Zhenghe said: "From the age of penal codes and names onward, the great controls the small, the strong subdues the weak. The Dao manifests through weakness and humility, its subtlety and wonder lying in its profundity. Thus, nothing can escape it, and all things endure.

A hundred-fathom abyss may be measured in depth, the heights of azure clouds may be reached, yet the Dao encompasses and sustains them all. Those who embody the Dao hold fast to simplicity, and the myriad things submit of their own accord. The metaphor lies here: drawing a cart-sized fish with a fine line, or bringing down two cormorants amid the clouds with a weak bow. The sage’s governance of the world is no different.

Fan said: "The King of Chu, hearing of Jen Ho’s angling, understood how to govern the state. The Yellow Emperor, questioning a child herdsman, grasped how to rule the world—the principle is the same.

Gongyu of Lu and Qiying of Zhao both fell ill and sought treatment from Bian Que. After curing them, Bian Que said: 'Your former ailments, which arose externally and afflicted the organs, were easily remedied by medicine and stone. But now you have a congenital illness that has grown with your body. If I were to treat it now, what would you say?'

The two replied: 'We would first like to hear its symptoms.'"

Bian Que said to Gongyu: "Your will is strong but your qi is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decisiveness. *Will here refers to the mind’s intelligence; qi to one’s inherent nature. With abundant intelligence comes overthinking; with a weak nature comes indecision.* Qiying’s will is weak but his qi is strong, so he lacks forethought yet errs in recklessness. *With scant intelligence but a dominant nature, one acts boldly yet self-servingly.* If we were to exchange your hearts, you would both attain balance in virtue."

Thereupon, Bian Que gave the two men a toxic draft, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then split open their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and replaced them. After administering a divine medicine, they awoke as before. The two took their leave and returned home.

Yet Gongyu entered Qiying’s house and claimed his wife and children, who did not recognize him. Likewise, Qiying entered Gongyu’s house and claimed his wife and children, who also did not recognize him. *As their hearts were exchanged, they followed their original memories, each returning to the other’s home. Since their forms were no longer their own, their families failed to recognize them.* The two households then brought suit against each other, seeking Bian Que’s judgment. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was resolved.

This account is fantastical, rarely found in records. Yet during the Wei dynasty, Hua Tuo could split open abdomens, exchange viscera, and cleanse the five organs—proof that the world holds principles beyond human comprehension. One should not dismiss such matters out of hand; better to preserve them without debate.

Lu said: "The body is an insensate thing; the spirit is the sentient master. Abiding in one’s true nature preserves wholeness and aligns with the Dao, while clinging to form loses one’s nature and succumbs to emotion. The common folk see only the body’s attachments, unaware that the spirit governs. This tale of exchanged hearts and estranged families illustrates that the heart rules the emotions, while the body is truly insensate. Thus, the Daoist values the cultivation of spirit."

Zhenghe said: "Illness arises when form loses balance; so too when nature loses balance. Physical illness is treated with medicine and stone; illness of nature requires Daoist arts. The will commands qi, and qi fills the body. Will governs planning; qi governs decisiveness. When balance is lost, strength and weakness invert. Thus, one with a strong will and weak qi excels in planning but lacks decisiveness, while one with a weak will and strong qi lacks forethought but errs in recklessness. The heart is the master of the five senses. Exchanging hearts adjusts their strengths to harmony—this is the marvel of the illness-free, the profound work of medicine. The sage governs the world through the mysterious Dao, unifying balance and imbalance—how is this different?"

Fan said: "Mencius said: 'The will arrives first; qi follows.' He also said: 'Hold fast to your will; do not coerce your qi.' The will is the mind’s direction; qi is the will’s instrument. Any imbalance disrupts nature’s harmony, creating illness. Thus, the will is like a general; qi like the troops. A strong will with weak qi leaves a general without an army—hesitant and indecisive. A weak will with strong qi leaves troops without direction—reckless and self-serving. Without medicine to transform the heart and alter its thoughts, how could such illness be cured? I have observed that Hua Tuo of the Wei dynasty possessed the arts of splitting abdomens, exchanging viscera, and cleansing the five organs—thus this account is hardly strange.

When Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. *Hu Ba was a master zitherist of old.* Zheng Shiwen, hearing of him—*Shiwen was a music master of Zheng*—abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. *Master Xiang was also a renowned zitherist of old.* For three years, he placed his fingers on the strings and plucked, yet could not form a melody. *Adjusting his fingers and tuning the strings, he spent three years without mastering a single piece.* Master Xiang said: 'You may return home.' *He despaired of teaching him.*

Shiwen set down his zither and sighed: 'It is not that my fingers cannot pluck the strings, nor that I cannot form a melody. My focus lies not in the strings; my aspiration not in sound. Only by forgetting the strings and sound can one fully realize their use. If the heart is not at ease within, nor the instrument responsive without, how dare I move my hands to play?' *When heart, hand, and instrument harmonize without discord, then perfect music arises.*

Lu said: "People know how to train the body to produce sound, but do not realize that discerning sound and moving the body is the work of the spirit. If the heart does not respond to the instrument, the music, though formed, lacks precision. To exhaust the instrument’s potential and perfect the body’s artistry, one must achieve spiritual resonance and inner attainment."

Master Xiang granted him a brief respite to observe his progress. Before long, Shiwen returned. Master Xiang asked: 'How is your zither playing?' Shiwen replied: 'I have grasped it. Please allow me to demonstrate.' *Lu said: When the heart is attuned and the instrument responsive, one may then practice sound to commune with the spirit.*

Thus, in spring, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*—*Shang, the metal tone, belongs to autumn; Nanlü is the eighth-month pitch.* A cool breeze suddenly arose, and plants bore fruit. *He captured autumn’s essence, bringing maturity.* In autumn, he struck the *jiao* string to arouse *Jiazhong*—*Jiao, the wood tone, belongs to spring; Jiazhong is the second-month pitch.* A warm breeze gently swirled, and plants flourished. *He captured spring’s essence, bringing vitality.*

In summer, he struck the *yu* string to summon *Huangzhong*—*Yu, the water tone, belongs to winter; Huangzhong is the eleventh-month pitch.* Frost and snow descended together, and rivers and ponds froze solid. *He captured winter’s essence, bringing congealed yin and frozen waters.* In winter, he struck the *zhi* string to arouse *Ruibin*—*Zhi, the fire tone, belongs to summer; Ruibin is the fifth-month pitch.* The sun’s rays blazed fiercely, and hard ice instantly melted. *He captured summer’s essence, bringing dissolution.*"

At this moment of playing the zither, there was no means to suddenly alter the four seasons. Yet by demonstrating the effect of one season, the other three could be inferred—this was merely to convey the marvel of the responses evoked. As the performance drew to a close, he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize all four, and then the *jing* wind soared, auspicious clouds drifted, sweet dew descended, and sweet springs welled forth. Such perfect harmony moved Master Xiang to press his hand to his heart and exclaim in exaltation: "How subtle is your playing! Even the *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang—when he performed it for Duke Ping of Jin, the first playing summoned white clouds from the northwest; the second brought gale winds and rain; the third tore the curtains, shattered the ritual vessels, sent roof tiles flying, and sent all attendants fleeing in panic. Duke Ping cowered in terror, and Jin suffered a great drought, its lands scorched for three years—could only produce sounds that brought either fortune or misfortune. Or like Zou Yan’s blowing of the pitch-pipes—there was a land in the north, fertile yet frigid, where the five grains would not grow. Zou Yan blew the pipes to warm it, and suddenly millet and sorghum flourished. Nothing surpasses this; they would but clutch their zithers and flutes to follow in your wake."

Lu said: "When one acts in accord with one’s inherent nature, the responses of yin and yang’s numerology and the sequence of the four seasons arise spontaneously. Even water and fire cannot drown or burn one—how much less the qi of wind, rain, cold, or heat? Thus the *Book of Changes* says: 'Act before Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose; how much more so for man? How much more for ghosts and spirits?' This is what it means. Such transformations through sound and pitch do not depend on the four seasons."

*Zhenghe* states: "The supreme music regulates the four seasons, harmonizes the myriad things, and as the four seasons succeed one another, the myriad things follow their cycles of life. In its subtlety, the two kinds [of sound and qi] merge, the two interact. What some call death, others call life; what some call substance, others call flourishing. Moving or lingering, scattering or shifting, it does not adhere to ordinary sounds. Thus, when sound stirs qi, it responds to the stirring—this is the inevitable principle. In spring, strike the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*, and autumn’s qi answers; in autumn, strike the *jiao* string to arouse *Jiazhong*, and spring’s qi answers; in summer, strike the *yu* string to summon *Huangzhong*, and winter’s qi answers; in winter, strike the *zhi* string to arouse *Ruibin*, and summer’s qi answers. Thus, music’s influence can even alter the sequence of the four seasons and seize the mechanism of creation—its marvel is such. When all are harmonized together, they intermingle to form perfect accord, and so the *jing* wind soars, auspicious clouds drift, sweet dew descends, and sweet springs well forth. For the qi of all under Heaven is one. When sound aligns with qi, the response is natural. Birds dance and fish leap—these are but its incidental effects."

Fan said: "The zither is the gentleman’s constant companion in music. Its construction is refined, its meaning profound; its sound subtle, its power great. It begins by guarding the heart to restrain oneself and ends by transcending the instrument to attain enlightenment. Thus, a sound produced in the space of a single step resonates to the heights of the Great Purity. Of old, the Yellow Emperor played the *Qingjiao* zither to assemble the ghosts and spirits, and phoenixes blotted out the sun. Yao played the zither, and the celestial spirits descended; Shun sang the *Nanfeng*, and all under Heaven was transformed. How could this be mere bird dances and fish leaps like those of Hu Ba? Yet the zither’s construction rests on silk strings stretched over wood—its sound emerges thus. For fire finds voice through wood, and spirit responds to form in the world, harboring ineffable marvels within. If one clings rigidly to the nearness of form and instrument or is blinded by the superficiality of sound, how can one grasp the Dao of music?

When Master Wen first studied, his fingers pressed the bridges and hooked the strings, but in the end, he set the zither aside and sighed in realization. What he preserved was not in the strings; what he aspired to was not in the sound. He may be said to have attained this. Thus, striking the strings to summon the pitches transforms the four qi. When he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize all four, the *jing* wind soared, auspicious clouds drifted, sweet dew descended, and sweet springs welled forth—so harmonious was the sound that it brought forth such auspicious signs. Compared to this, Master Kuang’s *Qingjiao*, which summoned wind and rain when played, or Zou Yan’s pitch-pipes, which warmed the land so millet and sorghum flourished—how could they surpass it? It is fitting that Master Xiang pressed his hand to his heart and danced in exaltation.

Xue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing—both were renowned singers of the state of Qin. Before exhausting Qin Qing’s art, Xue Tan believed he had mastered it and took his leave. Qin Qing did not stop him but saw him off at the crossroads in the suburbs. There, he beat time and sang a mournful song; its sound shook the trees, its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then apologized and begged to return, never daring to speak of leaving again. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said: 'Long ago, Han E, a skilled singer of Han, traveled east to Qi. Running out of provisions, she passed through Yongmen, where she sold her songs for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams, lingering for three days without ceasing. The people thought she had not gone. When she passed an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then sang a long, mournful lament. The old and young of the village grieved and wept, facing one another in sorrow, and for three days they ate nothing. They hastily pursued her. Han E returned and sang a long, joyful song. The old and young of the village leapt and danced for joy, unable to restrain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. Thus, the people of Yongmen to this day excel in singing and weeping, emulating Han E’s lingering tones. In the time of the Six States, there was a man of Yongmen named Zhou, skilled in the zither and also in weeping, who wept before Lord Mengchang.'"

Lu said: "The six senses, when employed, can all achieve communion. When communion is achieved, marvelous responses arise without limit—not merely through the mind’s perception. Thus, Gongyu of Lu spoke directly of the heart’s function, while those like Hu Ba attained communion through sound."

*Zhenghe* states: "When sound shakes the trees and halts the passing clouds, this is but the strength of its emission and the distance of its lingering resonance. When long, drawn-out songs and weeping move the old and young of a village to joy or sorrow, stirring their spirits and altering their thoughts—this is the sublime mastery of singing."

Fan said: "When Qin Qing struck his rhythm, his sound shook the trees and halted the passing clouds; when Han E’s drawn-out song transformed the old and young of a village—this arose from sincerity within that evoked response without, and could not but be so. How much more, then, when one’s own sincerity is expressed?

Boya was skilled in playing the zither, while Zhong Ziqi was skilled in listening. When Boya played, his intent was to ascend a high mountain. Zhong Ziqi said: 'Excellent! Lofty as Mount Tai!' His intent turned to flowing water. Zhong Ziqi said: 'Excellent! Vast as the Yangtze and Yellow River!' Whatever Boya conceived, Zhong Ziqi invariably grasped.

Once, Boya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai. Suddenly, a violent storm arose, and he took shelter beneath a cliff. His heart filled with sorrow, he took up his zither and played. First came the melody of ceaseless rain, then the sound of crumbling mountains. With every piece he performed, Zhong Ziqi exhausted its essence.

Boya then set aside his zither and sighed: 'Excellent! Excellent! How well you listen! Your thoughts and imaginings are as my own heart—our minds align in secret, no different from mine. Where could I hide my sound from you?' Once a note was struck, Zhong Ziqi had already grasped his intent, leaving no place to conceal its meaning.

Lu said: "The formation of sound follows what moves it; the heart’s arising is accompanied by sound. Thus, the five senses all commune, wholly transmitted by the perceiving mind. For one skilled in listening, even a cough reveals its meaning—how much more when sound is shaped by pattern? How could it not be discerned?"

*Zhenghe* states: "What resides in the heart is intent. All sound arises from the human heart. Moved by things, it then stirs, and the heart’s direction may be examined. Yet if listening stops at the ear, one knows sound but not music; if listening unites with the heart, one examines music to know its meaning. This is how Ziqi’s listening attained the subtlest depths."

Fan said: "The Dao cannot be heard; what is heard is not it. Yet beyond sound, there are indeed those who reach the realm of listening. What Boya played and Ziqi heard never departed from the realm of form and sound—high mountains and flowing waters—yet with every performance, its essence was exhausted. What sound could possibly escape?"

Yao asked:

When King Mu of Zhou made his western tour of inspection, he crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, he encountered someone presenting a craftsman named Yanshi. Along the way, a certain state had offered this master of ingenuity. King Mu received him—*jian* here should be read as *jin*, "to present." The king asked, "What skills do you possess?"

Yanshi replied, "Your servant awaits only your command to demonstrate. However, I have already created something; I humbly request that Your Majesty first observe it."

The king said, "Come together on another day"—*ri* here meaning a separate day. "I shall view it with you."

Lu commented: "The marvel of spiritual application—how could it be limited to sound alone? Color, fragrance, and flavor all attain their principles. Thus, this chapter speaks of carving and shaping to the utmost subtlety."

The next day, Yanshi sought an audience with the king. The king received him and asked, "Who is the person accompanying you?"

He replied, "It is a singing performer I have created"—*chang* meaning an actor or entertainer.

King Mu gazed at it in astonishment: its gait, bowing, and posture were truly those of a human. When the skillful craftsman stroked its chin, it sang in perfect harmony; when he took its hand, it danced in time. With a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it followed intention as desired. The king took it for a real person and, together with Sheng Ji, his inner consort, observed it closely. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: "Sheng Ji was King Mu’s beloved beauty."

As the performance neared its end, the performer winked at the king’s attending concubines on the left and right. The king grew furious and immediately sought to execute Yanshi.

Yanshi, greatly terrified, immediately disassembled the performer before the king to reveal its construction: all were joined from leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. The king examined it closely—within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, limbs, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and hair—all artificial yet perfectly complete. When reassembled, it appeared as it had at first sight, just as when it had first met the king.

The king tested it: when he removed its heart, its mouth could not speak; when he removed its liver, its eyes could not see; when he removed its kidneys, its feet could not walk. All these were controlled by mechanisms, and without the master mechanism, they could not govern one another—just as when a person’s five viscera are afflicted, the seven orifices and four limbs outwardly respond.

Lu said: "The inner liver, gallbladder, heart, and lungs enable the outer functions of sight, hearing, movement, and perception; when set in motion, they become living things. Without spirit, they cannot employ their five senses. Now, the creation of living things by the forces of nature—how is it different from what Yanshi has made? If devoid of spirit, they would be no more than plants and trees; but if spirit is present, what is so extraordinary about their movement? The wooden figure moves by Yanshi’s spirit, so it fittingly resembles a living being. The craft of spirit reaches its utmost—how far removed is it from transformation?"

King Mu, now pleased, sighed and said: "Can human skill truly match the work of creation?" He ordered his secondary chariot to carry it back.

In recent times, some have claimed that human intelligence arises from mechanisms—what does this mean? The work of creation is supremely subtle, thus all things are nurtured, moving without fixed form. Human artistry is crude, merely shaping form from inert matter. Yet when skill reaches its utmost, it nearly approaches creation. Perhaps such claims arise from this idea, though this text does not endorse them. To clarify this point, one should consider that supreme skill transcends conventional limits, so examples of extreme craft are given to dispel common delusions—not to suggest that things lack a spiritual essence, which would be a grave error.

Ban Shu’s cloud-ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite were each deemed the pinnacle of their skill. Ban Shu’s cloud-ladder could ascend the void for assault; Mozi’s wooden kite flew for three days without landing. When disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yanshi’s craft, they reported it to the two masters, who thereafter never dared speak of their own arts and constantly held compass and square. "Constantly held compass and square" means they dared not boast of their skills.

Lu said: "Yanshi’s subtlety unites with the spirit of creation; Ban Shu and his like merely exhaust mechanical ingenuity. This shows that supreme skill cannot be confined to mere tools."

*Zhenghe* states: "Borrowing from strange materials, entrusting to a shared form, lodging within a hundred bones, imitating ears and eyes—its sight, hearing, speech, appearance, gait, bowing, and posture seemed as if naturally its own, unaware of its own actions. Such exquisite skill, such profound workmanship, uniquely achieves its own nature, possessing human form—how could it merely approximate reality? Yanshi’s creation truly matches the work of creation.

Yet living beings are but temporary assemblages. The Dao grants them appearance, Heaven grants them form—how is this different? Fang said: "Kunlun is the mound of tranquility; Yan Mountain is where the sun sets. To pass Kunlun without reaching Yan Mountain is to seek stillness while still in motion, unable to depart brightness for darkness—thus one turns back. Yanshi’s performer equals the work of creation: when its chin is stroked, it sings in harmony like the spontaneous music of nature; when its hand is taken, it dances in rhythm like the self-moving mechanism of Heaven. With a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it follows intention as desired. King Mu gazed in astonishment, truly believing it a real person—never realizing it was merely an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. Such is the advancement of skill—how much more so for one who embodies the Dao and comprehends the workings of things?"

Gan Ying, an ancient master archer, drew his bow and beasts crouched, birds descended. His arrows never missed, and birds and beasts dared not flee. *The Strategies of the Warring States* records: "Geng Lei shot without drawing the bow, yet birds fell." His disciple, Fei Wei, studied archery under Gan Ying and surpassed his teacher. Ji Chang, in turn, studied under Fei Wei.

Fei Wei said: "First learn not to blink, then we may speak of archery." Ji Chang returned home, lay beneath his wife’s loom, and fixed his gaze on the heddle rod. After two years, even if a cone’s tip touched his eyelashes, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei, who said: "Not yet."

Lu said: "Drawing an empty bow to bring down birds is the subtlety of skill; surpassing one’s teacher is the penetration of spirit. Subtlety lies in practice, spirit in precision. Learning not to blink is the utmost precision; fixing the gaze without movement is the settling of spirit. Yet if settled but not applied, it is still insufficient—you must learn to see."

Lu said: "This means using unblinking eyes to see." "See the small as large, the faint as clear—then tell me." Lu said: "To see clearly is to perceive the small as large."

Chang suspended a louse from the window with a yak’s hair and faced south to observe it. Within ten days, it gradually grew larger; after three years, it appeared as big as a cartwheel. Viewing other things, they all seemed like mountains. Seeing the louse as a wheel, other things proportionally enlarged. Then, with a bow of Yan horn and arrows of northern reeds, he shot through the louse’s heart without breaking the suspension—demonstrating the marvel of his hand’s skill.

He reported this to Fei Wei. Fei Wei leapt up, clapped his chest, and exclaimed: "You have grasped it!" Lu said: "To see the small as large—piercing it is no longer difficult."

Once Ji Chang had mastered all of Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that in all the world, only one man could rival him, and so he plotted to kill Fei Wei. Lu said: "To crush his ability to compare, one must surpass the master’s method. To erase Fei Wei’s name does not mean severing his life."

They met in the wild, and the two exchanged shots. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground without stirring a speck of dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. *Exhausted* means depleted. Ji Chang loosed one final arrow, and as it flew, Fei Wei intercepted it with the tip of a thorn, not missing by a hair. Lu said: "Two arrows followed the same path, meeting as their momentum faded—thus they fell to the earth without raising dust, so minute was the difference. To deflect with a thorn without error is the height of precision."

Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, and bowed to each other on the road, pledging to become father and son. They cut their arms and swore an oath never to reveal their art to others, guarding its secrecy. This chapter’s principles are already detailed in the *Zhongni* section. Lu said: "This is what is meant by spiritual communion and mutual understanding—it transcends the art of archery. Thus they cast aside their bows and swore, for only then could the profound connection be transmitted, and so they could not pass on the technique."

*Zhenghe* states: "Only when the inner is settled can the outer respond. Only when the minute is scrutinized can what is manifest be grasped without omission." Bohun Maoren said to Liezi: "You still harbor the intent of a squinting eye within—this is perilous." He referred to the inability to settle the inner. Ji Chang first learned not to blink, training his eyes to follow the suspended hair for this reason.

*Zhuangzi* says: "One who views the great as small lacks clarity." This refers to the inability to scrutinize the minute. Chang, gazing at the louse suspended by yak hair until it gradually grew large, did so for this reason. Truly, those who do not comprehend this yet excel in archery are rare.

Fan said: "When shooting at a hundred paces, the arrow’s arrival depends on your strength, but its hitting the mark does not. Thus, those who teach archery must focus on the draw, and learners must likewise focus on the draw. Is this not because what lies within the division of strength can be learned, while what lies beyond it cannot be forced?" Fei Wei studied archery under Gan Ying and surpassed his master, for he had naturally attained the innate essence of the art.

In the human body, the heart governs the inner, while the eyes lead in engaging the external. Thus, spirit unites with the heart, and its mechanism is ever present in the eyes. When Ji Chang studied under Fei Wei, he was first instructed to learn not to blink, so that his spirit might be whole within, and he would not be daunted when confronting things. Yet merely not blinking was not the ultimate attainment. Among the ancients who cultivated courage, there were those who practiced not averting their gaze. But to see the small as large, the faint as clear, and to perceive a louse on the eyelash as towering Mount Song—this approaches the realm of gazing with tranquil spirit. Thus, he could draw the Yan horn bow, loose the northern reed arrow, and pierce the suspended louse, achieving the "shooting that does not shoot," with mastery residing within himself.

Yet in time, having perfected the skill of piercing willow leaves, he bent the bow of Hou Yi—how vainly he relied on strength and strove for supremacy in technique! Thus, at first they met in the wild and exchanged shots, their arrowheads clashing; later, they bowed on the road, cast aside their bows, and cut their arms to swear an oath. If even the humble art of archery must not be revealed to others, how much more so for one who embodies the Dao and advances into the untransmittable mystery?

Zaofu’s master was Taidou Shi, mentioned in various miscellaneous records. When Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with great humility. Taidou taught him nothing for three years. Zaofu’s observance of the rites grew even more reverent, and then Taidou said: "An ancient poem states: *The son of a good bowmaker must first learn to weave baskets; the son of a good smith must first learn to sew fur.* Baskets and furs require flexibility and patching before they become tools. For bowmakers and smiths, harmonizing sinew and horn or blending metal and iron is the same. Thus, the learner must first master what is easy before achieving what is difficult—this is the lesson."

Lu said: "The basket is the tool for making bows; the fur is the tool for fanning the forge. Laozi likened it to a bellows—today’s leather bag. The one uses a bow-bending frame, the other a fire-fanning bag; though not bows or smelting, bowmaking and smithing rely on them. Now observe my movements." *Movements* means actions. "Move as I do, and then you may hold the six reins and drive the six horses."

Zaofu said: "I will follow your command." Taidou then set up wooden planks as a path, just wide enough for his feet. Having secured his footing, he measured steps and placed them at intervals matching his stride. He walked upon them, running back and forth without stumbling. Zaofu learned this, and in three days mastered its skill.

Taidou sighed: "How quick you are! You grasped it swiftly." *Quick* means fast; *swift* means rapid. "All charioteering is like this." Lu said: "Setting up wood like feet, arranging them like steps. *Zhuangzi* says: *Beyond the space for one’s feet, all earth is removed—those who cannot walk it are unsettled.* If driving horses is like guiding one’s feet, then it is sublime."

"Previously, your movements were guided by your feet and responded to by your heart. Extending this to charioteering, you harmonize the reins and bit, adjust the tension in the lips and mouth, align the measure within your chest, and grasp the rhythm in your hands. Within, you attain the center of your heart; without, you unite with the horse’s intent. Thus, you can advance and retreat along the line, turn and curve within the compass, take the road to distant places, and still have strength to spare—truly mastering the art."

Perceiving it in the bit, responding with the reins; perceiving it in the reins, responding with the hands; perceiving it in the hands, responding with the heart. Then one need not rely on the eyes to see, nor use the whip to drive. With a tranquil heart and upright body, the six reins remain untangled, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning or advancing, retreating or curving, all align with the rhythm, harmonizing with the chime of the *heluan* bells. Only then may the wheels leave no excess track beyond their path, the hooves tread no ground beyond their place. Unaware of the peril of valleys or the levelness of plains, one regards them as one. My art is exhausted—you must grasp this.

What one treads is merely the space for one’s feet. Beyond the feet, there is no excess, yet others dare not step there—this is because the heart is not at ease, the body not tranquil. When the heart is at ease and the body tranquil, advance and retreat follow constant measure, speed and slowness adhere to fixed degree. If one attains its subtlety, this is not only applied to the self but may be extended to things. Though the six reins be tangled and the horse’s hooves numerous, with proper regulation, disorder is no concern. Thus, beyond the wheels, one does not rely on useless tracks; beyond the hooves, one does not depend on wasted ground. Can this not be so?

Lu said: *Zhuangzi*’s butcher explains: "Between the bones there is space; the blade of the knife has no thickness. With no thickness entering where there is space, how vast the room for movement!" This speaks of the principle—abundant leisure. Not regarding the ground beyond one’s feet keeps the mind focused; with focused intent, the feet move as the heart wills. If this is applied to the reins and bit, exchanged for a spirited steed, where tracks align with steps, what peril could there be?

People of the world seek the branches yet know not the root. Those who recognize truth must seek the root before applying it. Thus, even the minor arts of archery and charioteering must accord with the Dao.

**On Governance:** Without an inner master, there is no stillness; without outer correctness, there is no movement—this is the way of nature and practice mutually completing each other. Thus, governing the Dao begins with practice, and when the Dao is attained, it is perfected in nature. The son of a skilled archer first learns to weave baskets; the son of a master smith first learns to sew furs—this illustrates the importance of practice.

Setting wood as a path, just enough to hold the feet, placing them step by step, treading and walking—this is how one practices. For setting wood as a path, just enough for the feet, when extended to charioteering, the wheels leave no excess track, the hooves tread no wasted ground. Placing them step by step, treading and walking, when extended to charioteering, the peril of valleys and the levelness of plains are seen as one. Harmonizing the reins and bit, adjusting the tension in the lips and mouth—this is what is meant by "externally uniting with the horse’s intent." Aligning the measure within the chest, grasping the rhythm in the hands—this is what is meant by "internally attaining the center of the heart." Advancing and retreating along the line, turning and curving within the compass—this describes the mastery of driving. Taking the road to distant places with strength to spare—this describes its smoothness.

The reins connect to the bit, so perceiving it in the hands responds to the reins; the hands hold the reins, so perceiving it in the reins responds to the hands; the heart moves the hands, so perceiving it in the hands responds to the heart. To the point of not relying on the eyes to see or the whip to drive, where turning and advancing, retreating and curving all align with the rhythm—this is as if by nature’s spontaneity, unaware of one’s own doing. This is called skillful driving.

Fan said: When Jichang learned archery from Fei Wei, Fei Wei did not teach him archery but first instructed him to learn not to blink. When Zaofu learned charioteering from Taidou, Taidou did not teach him driving but first told him to observe his intent. This is drawing the bow without releasing, opening the door without leading through—allowing deep mastery of self-attained subtlety. Even in the minor arts of archery and charioteering, it is so—how much more for the Dao, which can be transmitted but not received? Thus, what is shown here is merely the form to awaken understanding; what is observed there is seen with the eyes yet retained in the mind. This is called "self-attainment"—how profound must its attainment be?

Observing Taidou’s charioteering: at first, he harmonized the reins and bit, adjusted the tension in the lips and mouth, aligned the measure within his chest, and grasped the rhythm in his hands. Internally attaining the center of his heart, externally uniting with the horse’s intent, he could advance and retreat along the line, turn and curve within the compass, take the road to distant places with strength to spare. This was within the bounds of method, never daring to transgress—such was his discipline.

As time passed, perceiving it in the bit, responding with the reins; perceiving it in the reins, responding with the hands; perceiving it in the hands, responding with the heart. No need to rely on the eyes to see or the whip to drive. With a tranquil heart and upright body, the six reins remained untangled, the twenty-four hooves landed without error, and in turning or advancing, retreating or curving, all aligned with the rhythm. This transcended method, effortlessly hitting the mark—such was his mastery.

To summarize in the end: beyond the wheels, no excess track; beyond the hooves, no wasted ground. Unaware of the peril of valleys or the levelness of plains, regarding them as one. Then there is no place that is not movement, no movement that is not the Dao. Whether level or sloped, the Dao unifies all—where could there be no leisure? In driving, one has reached this point—this is beyond mere skill.

Wei Heilu killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity. *Nixian* refers to private grudges. Lu said: Those who kill or harm out of personal enmity or indulge desires to destroy things are but common folk, not men of the Dao. Qiu Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Dan was fierce in spirit, exposed in form, ate by counting grains, and ran with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield a weapon to exact revenge...

The man had courage and spirit, yet his body was frail and weak, unable to lift a weapon. Ashamed to borrow strength from others, he swore to slaughter Heilu with his bare hands and a sword. Heilu’s ferocity surpassed all others, his strength equal to a hundred men. His sinews, bones, flesh, and skin were not of mortal kind. He would stretch his neck to meet the blade, bare his chest to receive arrows—edges bent and points shattered, yet his body bore no mark. Relying on his natural strength, he regarded Lai Dan as but a fledgling chick.

Lai Dan’s friend Shen Ta said: “Your hatred for Heilu is extreme, and his contempt for you surpasses all bounds—what plan will you devise?” Lai Dan wept and replied: “I beg you to devise one for me.” Shen Ta said: “I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, obtained the treasured swords of the Yin Emperor. When a mere boy wielded one, he repelled the masses of three armies. Why not seek his aid?”

Lu said: The most refined objects of Heaven and Earth serve only to overawe the multitudes with their majesty. If their merit lay in cutting and severing, they would not be of the utmost refinement.

Lai Dan then journeyed to Wei, where he met Kong Zhou. Assuming the role of a servant and charioteer, he first offered his wife and children in service before stating his desire. Kong Zhou said: “I possess three swords—choose whichever you wish. None can kill a man, but first let me describe their forms.

The first is called *Han Guang* (Concealed Light): invisible when gazed upon, unfelt when wielded. Where it touches, all boundaries dissolve—it passes through things, yet they remain unaware.

The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow): at the cusp of dawn’s first light or the dimming of dusk, when facing it, one perceives only a faint presence, its form unrecognizable. Where it touches, a faint whisper sounds—it passes through things, yet they suffer no harm.

The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Forged): by day, its shadow appears but its light does not; it shares the hue of sun and moon. By night, its light appears but its form does not. It illuminates the darkness. Where it touches, it severs with a *huo* sound—*huo* (the noise of splitting). It cuts and instantly mends, swift yet bloodless.

These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet they have never been put to use, for they cannot harm living things. They remain sealed in their caskets, never once opened.”

Lai Dan said: “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”

Kong Zhou then sent his wife and children away and fasted for seven days. During the quiet of dusk—*yan yin*, meaning the dimming of late evening—he knelt and presented the lowest of the swords. Lai Dan bowed twice and received it before departing. Since it could be grasped and seen, it was the lowest of the three.

Lu said: “The more precious the weapon, the deeper its harm to living things. The ultimate Dao and its utmost refinement inflict no injury upon them.”

Lai Dan then took the sword and followed Black Egg. At the time, Black Egg was drunk and sprawled beneath the window. Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist. Black Egg remained unaware. Believing Black Egg dead, Lai Dan hurried away. At the gate, he encountered Black Egg’s son and struck him three times as if thrusting into emptiness. Black Egg’s son merely laughed and said, “Why do you act so foolishly, waving at me three times?” Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.

When Black Egg awoke, he raged at his wife: “You let me drink until I exposed myself! Now my throat aches and my waist is stiff.” His son said, “Just now, Lai Dan came and met me at the gate. He struck me three times, leaving my body sore and my limbs stiff. He must have cursed me!”

Lu said: “The man who has attained the utmost Dao harms nothing in the world, nor can the world’s harms injure him. Thus, venomous creatures do not sting him, fierce beasts do not seize him. Even the most refined of things cannot harm him. As *Laozi* says: *His spirit does not injure; therefore, he is sagely.* What is prized in man is his ability to remain unharmed by all things. Why is this so?

*Zhenghe*: The *Han Guang* (Containing Light) blends with brightness yet does not shine; the *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow) abides in darkness yet does not shift. At the darkest hour, *Xiao Lian* (Night Forged) possesses tangible form, while *Han Guang* has none. Thus, it cannot be seen, its motion leaves no trace, and though it passes through things, they remain unaware. *Cheng Ying* exists in a state between presence and absence—though its form may not be recognized, its sound may sometimes be heard. *Xiao Lian*, however, is already something, for it has tangible form. Thus, by day, its shadow appears. Since it operates in darkness, by night, its light appears.

The Dao values non-action above all; existence between being and non-being is secondary, while confinement to form is lowest. Therefore, of the three swords, *Han Guang* is supreme, *Cheng Ying* comes next, and *Xiao Lian* is the lowest. Was the sword Lai Dan received the *Xiao Lian*?

Yet these three do not excel in cutting or severing—they are all divine swords. There exists in the world a constant path to victory: advance without obstruction, move without hindrance, and all under heaven will submit. How could it lie in mere striking and combat? Thus, *Zhuangzi* deemed the sword that severs necks and pierces lungs as the weapon of commoners. Alas, Lai Dan did not grasp this. Knowing the sword could not kill, he still deceived himself—how could this be the constant path to victory?

Fan said: Black Egg embodies the Dao’s return to utmost obscurity; Bing Zhang manifests the Dao’s brilliance in utmost clarity; Lai Dan, in turn, represents the hue of utmost yang. Thus, seeking vengeance for his father’s foe, he requested a sword from Wei Kong Zhou. One who possesses a sword from Yue keeps it sheathed and hidden, never daring to use it—such is its supreme value. The Dao’s utility is like this: advance without obstruction, lift without limit, press without descent, move without constraint. It parts floating clouds, severs earth’s foundations, and in its vastness, leaves ample room for the play of the blade.

Lai Dan received the sword from Kong Zhou yet used it only to avenge his father, striking Black Egg three times from neck to waist while he was drunk. In this, he differed not at all from those who sever necks above and pierce livers below—how could he have understood the way to wield it?

King Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong, who presented him with the *Kun Wu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a half, its finely wrought steel blade cutting jade as easily as mud. The fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire: the cloth turns the color of flame, while dirt takes on the cloth’s hue. Removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as white as snow. This is recorded in the *Book of Zhou*.

The Crown Prince believed no such things existed, dismissing the accounts as fabrications.

Xiao Shu said: The Crown Prince was obstinate in his self-assurance, obstinate in his denial of reason! This passage concludes the chapter, yet it recounts the jade-cutting sword and fire-washed cloth to demonstrate that all the preceding records are factual. If these two things are not false, then none are.

Lu said: If metal cannot cut jade, it is not because the blade is dull; if cloth cannot be washed in fire without burning, it is due to the object’s peculiar nature. Within heaven and earth, among the myriad things, some can be understood by reason, while others lie beyond its reach. Thus, though jade is hard, it has veins that can be carved; though a sword is iron, it has an edge that must sever. When an edge that must sever meets a thing that can be carved, failure to penetrate arises not from the blade’s lack of sharpness but from the absence of a principle of cutting. Yet if such a principle exists, why doubt it?

Moreover, among living things, their natures differ: some thrive by water and fire, others perish by them. The fire-mountain rat lives by fire, the wind-born beast lives by wind. Man depends on empty space to stand, fish depend on water to exist. Thus, the fire-washed flax is neither ramie nor hemp, yet its name as cloth is the same as those of the Central States. Its nature is akin to the fire-rat’s fur—what is so strange about this? To be obstinate in self-assurance is truly to lack understanding.

*Zhenghe*: The people of the world take what their ears and eyes perceive as real and dismiss what they cannot as nonexistent. Yet beyond the eight wilds, the limits cannot be fathomed—how can one assume that what ears and eyes cannot reach does not exist?

Fan said: The jade-cutting blade and fire-washed cloth exist by principle, yet those confined to the use of their ears and eyes insist such things do not exist. How could they ever comprehend the farthest reaches of knowledge?

This passage concludes the preceding records to clarify that all previously documented matters are grounded in the ultimate principle, not merely extravagant empty words meant to astonish the world.

**On Power and Fate**
Zhang said: Fate is the inevitable term, the predestined portion. Though the matter has yet to manifest, the principle is already so. To claim that longevity or early death depends on nurture, or that success and failure hinge on knowledge and effort, is to be deluded by heavenly principle.

Lu said: Fate is the fixed portion, yet without power it cannot be fulfilled. Power is the force of advancement, yet without fate it cannot be realized. Those endowed with fate must rely on their power; those with power may or may not align with their fate. There are things power cannot attain—this is the absence of fate. Waiting for fate without striving is to await the hour; trusting fate but not power is a grave error, while trusting power but not fate is likewise misguided.

*Zhenghe*: Power may be wise or foolish, fate may be prosperous or impoverished; the disparity between gain and loss cannot be opposed. Unwavering in resolve is how one establishes fate.

Fan said: The ancients had a saying: "That which arrives without knowing how is fate." Another: "Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so—this is fate." Fate resides in Heaven; before form takes shape, its portion is already set—how could power ever control it? Only by knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it can one attain this, and none but the virtuous can achieve such equanimity.

Power said to Fate: "What is your merit compared to mine?"
Fate replied: "What have you ever done for things that you dare compare yourself to me?"
Power said: "Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are all within my power."
Fate said: "Peng Zu’s wisdom did not surpass Yao and Shun’s, yet he lived eight hundred years; Yan Yuan’s talent did not exceed that of ordinary men, yet he died at thirty-two. Confucius’s virtue did not fall below that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai; King Zhou of Yin’s conduct did not surpass the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew wealthier than Zhan Qin. If these were within your power, why grant longevity to one and early death to another, obstruct the sage while elevating the wicked, debase the worthy while ennobling the foolish, impoverish the good while enriching the evil?"
Power said: "If what you say is true, then I have no merit in things—yet why do things turn out as they do? Is this not your doing?"
Fate said: "Since it is called fate, how could there be one who controls it? I merely follow the straight and yield to the crooked. Whether long-lived or short-lived, successful or failed, noble or base, rich or poor—things are so without knowing why, and this is fate. How could it be controlled? How could I ever comprehend it? How could I ever comprehend it?"

This passage clarifies that all things have their fate, rendering wisdom and power ineffectual. The *Yang Zhu* chapter speaks of people indulging their desires, implying that control does not derive from fate. The principles differ and seem contradictory. Yet as order and chaos shift, love and hate contend, emotions and deceit multiply, and the times compel competition—who can truly know the reason? Thus, the sage preserves both without debate, for the great support of the moral order cannot entirely block the paths to corruption. Some rely on cunning and force to defy fate, like King Zhuang of Chu inquiring about the Zhou tripods or Wu Zhi causing chaos in Qi. Others feign natural integrity to pursue fame, like Boyi and Shuqi starving on Western Mountain or Zhong You being minced in Wei. Therefore, Liezi examines both extremes, allowing all things to seek their own middle way. If one attains this middle, then the cunningly active will not disrupt their inherent portion with power, nor will the proud and fame-seeking harm their lives through artificial restraint. The intent of this discourse lies herein. Alas, can readers fail to discern this?

Lu said: Fate is Heaven; power is man. Fate can fulfill, power can move—thus it is called "moving fate." *Zhuangzi* said: "Knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate"—this is when power cannot move it. Confucius said: "At fifty, I understood Heaven’s mandate. Without understanding fate, one cannot be a noble person." Yet when traveling through the states and seeking office, he longed to hold the whip of a charioteer—this was not forgetting power.

*Zhenghe*: Fate lies in Heaven, power lies in man—power may achieve its ends. Yet what lies in Heaven is beyond human mastery, so the noble person does not rely on power but submits to fate. What lies in man is beyond Heaven’s opposition, so the noble person does not rely on fate. Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are what all things receive, for there is indeed one who ordains them. Because one dares not resist, one follows the straight. Because it cannot be halted, one yields to the crooked. It is neither within power’s ability to control nor fate’s power to oppose—it is simply natural. Why trouble oneself with excessive knowledge? Thus it is said: "How could I ever comprehend it?"

Fan said: Time does not halt, so years vary in length—Peng Zu and Yan Yuan’s differing lifespans illustrate this. Portions are not constant, so circumstances vary in gain and loss—Confucius and King Zhou’s differing fortunes show this. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng monopolized Qi—how vastly different their nobility! Yet from the Dao’s perspective, there is such a thing as equal nobility. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew wealthier than Zhan Qin—how vastly different their wealth! Yet from the Dao’s perspective, there is such a thing as equal poverty and wealth.

The boundaries of nature’s allotment are scarcely knowable, so one may only push forward in straightness, allowing each to find its proper place without partiality; or yield in flexibility, allowing each to follow its course without resistance. Longevity and early death, success and failure, nobility and baseness, poverty and wealth—all are self-determined. Who, then, is the agent behind them? Only those who grasp the truth of fate do not strive in vain, knowing what lies beyond human control. Thus, life and death are of great consequence. If one cannot alter them, how much less can the gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes that lie between disturb the heart?

Beigongzi said to Ximenzi: "You and I share the same era, yet you are esteemed while I am not. We come from the same clan, yet you are revered while I am slighted. Our appearances are alike, yet you are beloved while I am ignored. Our words are similar, yet yours are valued while mine are dismissed. Our conduct is the same, yet yours is trusted while mine is doubted. We both serve in office, yet you are exalted while I remain lowly. We both till the soil, yet you grow wealthy while I remain poor. We both trade, yet you profit while I do not. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain and oysters, dwell in a thatched hut, and walk on foot. You wear embroidered silks, feast on fine millet and meat, live in a mansion with towering beams, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you wear a carefree expression as if casting me aside; at court, you bear a haughty demeanor as if scorning me. We no longer seek each other’s favor, nor do we travel together—this has been so for years. Do you truly believe your virtue surpasses mine?"

Ximenzi replied: "I have no way of knowing the truth of this. You pursue affairs and meet with failure, while I pursue them and meet with success—is this not proof of the disparity in our virtue?"

Lu said: "All I pursue meets with success, while all you pursue meets with failure. The thickness or thinness of virtue is plain to see. Yet you claim to be my equal—how shameless you are!"

Beigongzi had no reply. He departed in dismay, and on the road, he encountered Master Dongguo.

The master asked: "Where have you been that you return with such a halting gait and a look of deep shame?"

Beigongzi recounted what had transpired.

Master Dongguo said: "I shall relieve you of your shame. Let us go together to question Ximenzi. Ask him: ‘Why do you humiliate Beigongzi by probing so deeply?’ Speak plainly."

Ximenzi replied: "Beigongzi says we share the same era, clan, age, appearance, words, and conduct, yet our nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty differ. I told him: ‘I have no way of knowing the truth of this. You pursue affairs and meet with failure, while I pursue them and meet with success—is this not proof of the disparity in our virtue?’ And you claim to be my equal—how shameless you are!"

Master Dongguo said: "Your notion of ‘thickness’ and ‘thinness’ refers merely to differences in talent and virtue. My understanding of ‘thickness’ and ‘thinness’ differs. Beigongzi is thick in virtue but thin in fate; you are thick in fate but thin in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are matters of Heaven, not of man. This is simply the way of nature, not a result of human skill or clumsiness. Yet you take pride in your thick fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his thick virtue—both fail to recognize the inherent principle of things."

Ximenzi said: "Master, you have silenced me. I dare not speak further." He heard the truth and submitted.

Lu said: "Ximenzi’s success in his pursuits is a matter of fate. Beigongzi’s failure in his pursuits is also a matter of fate. Those who do not understand fate bear an air of self-importance; those who understand it harbor no sorrow or shame. Success or failure is not a matter of wisdom or folly, nor of talent or virtue. Ximenzi dared not speak further because, knowing his success was a matter of fate, he dared not rely on his virtue."

After returning home, Beigongzi donned his coarse hempen robe, yet it warmed him like fox or marten fur. He ate his coarse beans, yet they tasted as fine as rice and millet. His thatched hut sheltered him like a grand hall, and his humble cart rode as smoothly as an ornate carriage. For the rest of his days, he remained at ease, unaware of honor or disgrace residing in others rather than himself. Once enlightened to the principle, the abundance or scarcity of external things no longer weighed upon his mind.

Lu said: "To know fate is to be free from sorrow and shame, and also to be unaware of the thickness or thinness of one’s virtue."

Master Dongguo, upon hearing this, said: "Beigongzi has slumbered for so long—yet a single word awakened him. How easily he was startled!"

Lu said: "To slumber is to remain unenlightened. When awakened, one is merely startled by what is ordinary."

*Zhenghe* states: Though they shared the same clan, words, conduct, age, and appearance, their nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, success and failure differed. Beigongzi’s failure was not due to folly, nor was Ximenzi’s success due to wisdom. The one who failed felt shame for his thick virtue, while the one who succeeded took pride in his thick fate—both were confined to a single corner of things, failing to comprehend the Dao. Who but Dongguo could have awakened them? Ximenzi dared not speak further, knowing only that his former view was mistaken. To awaken is to dissolve one’s intentions into the Dao—is this not the way to near-perfection?

Fan said: "Fate lies with Heaven; virtue lies with oneself. The noble person of old cultivated what lay within their power and awaited what lay with Heaven. Though they might prosper in their undertakings, they did not pride themselves on their abundant fate; though they might falter in their undertakings, they did not shame themselves for their abundant virtue. Abiding in their time and dwelling in accord, neither sorrow nor joy could enter them.

Beigongzi wore coarse hemp, ate coarse grain, dwelt in a thatched hut, and traveled on foot—one might call him impoverished, yet he did not know his virtue was abundant and thus felt shame for this. Ximenzi wore embroidered silks, ate fine meats, dwelt in a mansion, and rode in a carriage of four—one might call him prosperous, yet he did not know his virtue was meager and thus took pride in this. How could they recognize the principle that is inherently so?

Master Dongguo declined and withdrew, and only then did those who heard his words and awakened show no deep shame, and those who heard his reasoning and submitted abandon their self-aggrandizing conduct. In applying this to oneself, one does not covet another’s brocade robes—clad in coarse hemp, one has the warmth of fox and badger fur; why should one inherently feel shame for plain garments? One sated within does not covet another’s rich fare—partaking of coarse beans, one tastes the savor of fine rice; why should one inherently feel shame for simple food?

A hall towering several *ren* high—I, should I attain my will, would not build it; though sheltered in a thatched hut, it is as though shaded by a vast mansion. A thousand chariots in procession—I, should I attain my will, would not ride in them; though traveling in a humble cart, it is as though adorned with ornate carvings. All my life, I remain at ease, knowing neither honor nor disgrace lies with others but with myself. Thus, within the bounds of my allotted span, I move through namelessness. My view of things that come and go by chance is like watching sparrows, mosquitoes, gnats, and flies pass before me—how could they suffice to alter my plain path? Without understanding fate, one cannot advance to this."

Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were close friends, dwelling together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi royal clan was favored with many scions, and the lines of legitimate and lesser heirs advanced side by side. Yi Zhong, younger brother of Duke Xi of Qi, sired Gongsun Wuzhi; Duke Xi doted on him, granting him rites and rank equal to the crown prince. The people of the state feared disorder.

Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu. Jiu was the younger brother of Duke Xiang. Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai in flight to Ju. Xiaobai was Jiu’s younger brother. Soon after, Gongsun Wuzhi stirred rebellion. When Duke Xiang ascended, he demoted Wuzhi’s rank and robes, whereupon Wuzhi killed Duke Xiang and seized the throne. The people of the state swiftly slew him. With Qi left without a ruler, the two princes vied to return. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai on the road to Ju, shooting an arrow that struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Xiaobai feigned death and thus secured the throne—he was Duke Huan. He coerced Lu into executing Prince Jiu; Shao Hu died for his lord, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.

Qi sent word to Lu: “Prince Jiu was our lord’s brother; we cannot bear to execute him ourselves, so we ask you to kill him. Shao Hu and Guan Zhong are our enemies—we demand their bodies to be minced into meat sauce. If you refuse, we shall destroy Lu.” Lu, alarmed, put Prince Jiu to death. Shao Hu took his own life, while Guan Yiwu requested imprisonment.

Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.” Duke Huan replied: “He is my enemy; I wish to kill him.” Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy lord harbors no private grudges. Moreover, one who serves his own master loyally will surely serve a lord well. If you seek hegemony, without Yiwu it cannot be done. You must spare him.” Thereupon, Duke Huan summoned Guan Zhong. Lu returned him to Qi, and Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the outskirts, releasing him from his bonds. Duke Huan treated him with courtesy. Bao Shuya personally met Guan Zhong at Tangfu, removed his fetters, and presented him to Duke Huan at the Qi outskirts. He was elevated above Gao and Guo—the great clans of Qi—while Bao Shuya humbled himself beneath him. Entrusted with the governance of the state, he was styled “Father Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became hegemon.

Guan Zhong once sighed: “In my youth, when I was poor and troubled, I once traded goods with Bao Shuya, taking the larger share for myself. Bao Shuya did not deem me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shuya that led to great hardship; he did not deem me foolish, knowing that times may be favorable or unfavorable. I served three times and was thrice dismissed by my lord; Bao Shuya did not deem me worthless, knowing I had not met my time. I fought three battles and fled thrice; he did not deem me cowardly, knowing I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I endured imprisonment and humiliation; Bao Shuya did not deem me shameless, knowing I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name were not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life; Bao Shuya knows me.”

Thus the world praises the fine friendship of Guan and Bao, and Xiaobai’s skill in employing the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable. If there was no fine friendship and no skill in employing the capable, it was not that there existed some other fine friendship or skill in employing the capable. This makes clear that in the Dao of principle, there is no fine friendship or skill in employing the capable—this is not limited to Guan, Bao, and Duke Huan.

Lu said: “When the mandate calls for one’s use, then through friendship one attains advancement—this is not a matter of some other fine friendship or skill in employing the capable. Thus, those who rely on talent to gain office do so by mandate; those who advance through friendship do so by effort. Yet it is not solely a matter of Heaven’s timing, but also of human planning. When human effort succeeds, all is ascribed to mandate. When the mandate comes, Bao Shuya could not but exert his utmost, and Duke Huan could not but employ him—all was mandate. Shao Hu had no choice but to die; Bao Shuya had no choice but to recommend the worthy; Xiaobai had no choice but to follow counsel. All were driven by unseen forces, not controlled by human effort.”

Lu said: “Mandate is perfected through effort, and effort is perfected through mandate—there is no partiality in this.”

Fan said: “Guan Zhong’s relationship with Qi was such that to Bao Shuya he was a friend, and to Duke Huan he was a lord. He took the larger share of profits yet was not deemed greedy; his plans led to hardship yet he was not deemed foolish; he was dismissed thrice from office yet not deemed worthless; he fled thrice in battle yet not deemed cowardly; he endured imprisonment and humiliation yet not deemed shameless. Thus, Bao Shuya’s treatment of Yiwu truly embodied the Dao of fine friendship. At first, there was the battle on the road to Ju, where an arrow struck the belt hook; in the end, there was the welcome at Tangfu, where his fetters were removed.”

Holding a position above the state’s highest ranks, he bore the honorific “Uncle-Father”; nine times he assembled the feudal lords, once he rectified the realm—thus Duke Huan’s treatment of Yiwu truly embodied the Dao of employing the capable.

Yet in truth, there was no “fine friendship” in Guan and Bao’s bond, nor was there “skill in employing the capable” in Duke Huan’s use of Yiwu. If one were to set these aside and seek elsewhere, could there be any finer friendship or any greater skill in employing the capable? Such things arise not from deliberate action but always occur naturally—indeed, there is something in them that defies comprehension.

When Guan Yiwu fell ill, Duke Xiao Bai visited him and said: “Uncle-Father’s illness is grave. There is no need for reticence.” This meant the sickness was so severe that it could no longer be concealed.

Lu said: “When death is near, one cannot avoid speaking of it.”

“In the event of a fatal illness,” the duke asked, “to whom should I entrust the state?”

Yiwu replied: “Whom does Your Lordship desire?”

Duke Xiao Bai said: “Bao Shuya would be suitable.”

“No,” Yiwu said. “He is a man of purity and integrity, content with keeping himself unsullied. Toward those who do not measure up to him, he refuses to associate. He seeks to make all things equal through his own virtue. Once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. He cannot overlook flaws to recognize merit. If he were to govern the state, above he would constrain his lord, below he would alienate the people. He would insist on enforcing the ruler’s decrees, yet his Way would not be expansive. If the Way is not expansive, he would oppose the people and fail to win them over. His offense against the ruler would not be long in coming.”

Duke Xiao Bai said: “Then who would be suitable?”

Yiwu replied: “If there is no alternative, then Xi Peng would do—not that he is inherently suitable, but he will suffice. His character is such that above he forgets himself and below he does not incite rebellion. Though he occupies a high position, he does not dwell on his status, so he need not fear the people’s defection. He feels shame for falling short of the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not match his own abilities. He is humbled that his Way does not reach the sages and pities the people for not keeping pace with him. Thus, he does not discard others.”

Lu said: “When one forgets one’s own loftiness and feels shame for lacking virtue, the resolve to promote goodness runs deep. Those who are not one’s equal are met with compassion

Fan said: “The Old Master said: ‘Capacity leads to impartiality, impartiality leads to kingship.’ Impartiality and kingship—these names arise from reality. Only through impartiality can one be impartial; only through kingship can one be a king. As for Bao Shu’s character, he refuses to associate with those inferior to himself, and upon hearing of another’s fault, he never forgets it for the rest of his life—how can this be called capacity? As for Xi Peng’s character, above he forgets himself and below he does not incite rebellion. He feels shame for not matching the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not match himself. What he does not hear in the state, what he does not see in his household—this is the capacity that embodies the Way of impartiality.

When Guan Zhong answered Duke Huan, he deemed Bao Shu unfit to entrust with the state—not out of deliberate disparagement, but because he could not but disparage him. He deemed Xi Peng fit to entrust with the state—not out of deliberate esteem, but because he could not but esteem him. The ebb and flow of esteem and disparagement—how could one harbor intentions in their midst? It is simply a matter of following nature and nothing more.

Deng Xi wielded arguments of dual possibility, crafting endless words. During Zichan’s governance, he composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*—a simplified law. The state of Zheng adopted it. He repeatedly challenged Zichan’s administration, and Zichan yielded to him. Zichan seized and executed him, swiftly putting him to death. This tradition states that Zichan killed Deng Xi, while the *Zuozhuan* records that Sima Duan executed Deng Xi yet adopted his *Bamboo Penal Code*. Zichan died twenty years before Deng Xi’s death. Thus, Zichan did not willingly adopt the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he could not but adopt it. Deng Xi did not willingly yield to Zichan—he could not but yield. Zichan did not willingly execute Deng Xi—he could not but execute him. The principle of this passage mirrors that of the preceding one.

Lu said: “To establish laws is a matter of effort; to suffer execution is a matter of fate. To employ those laws is also a matter of effort; to execute the man is also a matter of fate. To apply effort to affairs is a matter of talent; for talent to go unrecognized is also a matter of fate.”

*Zhenghe* commentary: “To be unable not to adopt the *Bamboo Penal Code* is a matter of the times; to be unable not to execute Deng Xi is a matter of circumstances.”

Fan said: “Carefully examining the *Zuozhuan*: In the twentieth year of Duke Zhao, Zichan died. In the ninth year of Duke Ding, Sima Duan killed Deng Xi and adopted his *Bamboo Penal Code*. Thus, the claim that Zichan killed Deng Xi is merely a figurative expression to clarify the principle. Some live because they are meant to live—whether through accumulating virtue and practicing benevolence, or by encountering the right moment and achieving success, gaining the favor of their time and fulfilling their personal aspirations—it may seem like retribution, as if it arose from wisdom and effort.”

Heaven’s blessing—simply to live, simply to be at peace, not necessarily through virtue or wisdom, nor through power and effort. Yet through faithful and compliant conduct, one may fulfill personal aspirations, live out one’s years without care or fear—what else but Heaven’s blessing could this be?

To die when one might die:
Some accumulate evil and act with violence; some suffer hunger, cold, and destitution, thus scorning punishment and scorning life, so that death is imposed upon them—it may seem self-inflicted, as if it came in response to their deeds.
Heaven’s blessing—simply to die, simply to be brought low, not necessarily through cruelty or folly. Yet by indulging a cruel heart, dwelling in a place where life is not worth living, and having death imposed—such a death, fitting for one who dies, is also called Heaven’s blessing.

Lu said: To dwell in a time when one may live and obtain life is Heaven’s blessing; to dwell in a time when one may die and obtain death is also Heaven’s blessing. Like Yiwu, who sought life in the time of Duke Huan of Qi and succeeded in preserving his life—truly Heaven’s blessing. Like Chu Ni, who dashed his head against a locust tree to meet his end, neither dishonoring his lord’s command nor harming a worthy man, thus fulfilling his death and leaving behind an undying name—this too is Heaven’s blessing.

To live when one might not live:
Dwelling in honor and prosperity, wishing for long life yet dying early—this is Heaven’s punishment. To wish for life yet not obtain it is called Heaven’s punishment.

To die when one might not die:
Dwelling in hardship and disgrace, yet not wishing for a long life and yet not dying—this is Heaven’s punishment. To treat death lightly yet not die is also Heaven’s punishment.

Lu said: Dwelling in honor and prosperity, occupying a lofty position, yet not obtaining life when one might live—such as Dong Xian and the like. Dwelling in hardship and disgrace, enduring suffering and distress, yet not obtaining death when one might die—such as Ren Jing and the like. When desires are not fulfilled, all are Heaven’s punishment.

There are those who may live or die and do live or die—this is to live when one should live, to die when one should die. There are those who may neither live nor die, yet live or die nonetheless—this is to live when one should die, to die when one should live. These two cases seem to repeat what was already encompassed in the previous principle; perhaps there is an error in the text.

Yet in life and death, neither things nor the self hold sway—all is fate, beyond the reach of wisdom. Since the principles of life and death are unfathomable, death does not come from things, nor does life reside in the self—how could wisdom control them?

Lu said: Not from things, nor from the self; knowing cannot direct it, strength cannot achieve it—only then can one submit to fate.

*Zhenghe* commentary: That which comes through compliance is called blessing; that which descends through adversity is called punishment. To live when one may live, to die when one may die—both follow their natural course, thus they are called Heaven’s blessing. This speaks of Heaven’s favor, which comes in accordance with what is fitting. To not live when one may live, to not die when one may die—both defy what is inherently so, thus they are called Heaven’s punishment. This speaks of Heaven’s punishment, which descends according to the nature of things. Yet some may die when they might live, or live when they might die—such is the workings of fate. Who knows the reason? Thus even the wise are greatly perplexed, and only the enlightened understand its flow.

Fan said: Life is the companion of death, death the beginning of life—who knows their order? Only those who trace things back to their origin and return to their end, understanding the discourse on life and death, grasp the essence of fate and do not strive after what wisdom cannot control. Thus it is said: Profound and boundless, the Way of Heaven meets of itself; vast and undivided, the Way of Heaven moves of itself. Boundless and undivided—this is the ultimate of the natural. Meeting and moving of themselves—how could they be compelled?

Heaven and Earth cannot transgress it;
Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot defy the natural.

The sage and the wise cannot interfere with it;
Though the sage’s spirit is subtle, they cannot go against the course of time.

Ghosts and spirits cannot deceive it.
Though ghosts and spirits are uncanny, they cannot falsify what is true.

The natural silently completes it—
Silence, nothingness.

Levels it, pacifies it—
Leveling and pacifying require no action.

Guides it, welcomes it.
Yet in its lossless efficacy, it seems as if guided and welcomed.

Lu said: When one aligns with the Dao and fulfills fate, even Heaven and Earth cannot defy it; when one applies principle and responds to change like a spirit, not even ghosts and spirits can deceive it—how much less human affairs?

*Zhenghe* commentary: "Profound" speaks of depth and obscurity; "vast" speaks of boundlessness and indefinability. The wondrous essence has no essence, thus it is profound and boundless, and its Way meets of itself through the natural. The wondrous function has no function, thus it is vast and undivided, and its Way moves of itself through the natural. Given this, who can know the cause of life and death’s transformations?

That Heaven and Earth cannot transgress means that though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot violate the principle of the natural. That the sage and the wise cannot interfere means that though the sage and the wise are subtle, they cannot go against the principle of the natural. That ghosts and spirits cannot deceive means that though ghosts and spirits are hidden, they cannot delude the principle of the natural.

The natural silently completes it, existing without speech. In its non-action, it is still and unmoving—thus to level and pacify it is to abide in quietude, leaving no traces, and not be burdened by being. In its action, it responds and thoroughly penetrates the world’s affairs—thus to guide and welcome it is to respond to things without concealment and not be obscured by non-being.

Fan said: "Profound" is the utmost of obscurity; "vast" is the ultimate of stillness. The Way of Heaven is profoundly obscure, and things cannot fathom it—thus it is said to meet of itself. Without boundaries or limits, the Way of Heaven is utterly still, and things cannot disturb it—thus it is said to move of itself.

Without discrimination, though Heaven and Earth be vast, there are things they cannot transgress; though sagely wisdom be wondrous, there are things it cannot interfere with; though ghosts and spirits be uncanny, there are things they cannot deceive. In life and death alike, all follows the natural. To silence it requires no reliance on argument or explanation; to complete it demands no meddling with excess or deficiency. Merely level it, and there is neither lack nor surplus; merely pacify it, and there is neither disturbance nor agitation. With something to guide it, one can abide in harmony and depart in accord; with something to welcome it, one can rest in ease and meet the moment of its coming. Knowing that nothing can be done, one thus accepts it as it is—who but those of utmost destiny could attain this?

*Sixteenth Scroll of the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue Emptied and Subtle, *Four Commentaries*
**Strength and Destiny**

Yang Zhu’s friend, Ji Liang, fell ill, and after seven days, his condition grew critical. *Gradual* here means severe. His sons gathered around him, weeping, and summoned physicians. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu: “My sons are so foolish—why do you not sing for them to enlighten them?” Yang Zhu sang:

Does Heaven not know man—how could man awaken?
No blessing descends from Heaven, no calamity arises from man.
Is it I or you who does not understand?
Physicians and shamans—do they truly know?

He meant that only he and Ji Liang understood that life and death are a matter of destiny, not something physicians or shamans could comprehend. His sons did not understand and ultimately consulted three physicians, failing to grasp the meaning of Yang Zhu’s song and assuming it aligned with their own views.

Lu said: His sons sought physicians—could even Heaven’s mandate not be known? How then could men perceive it? Heaven does not bestow extra fortune, nor do men commit excesses. To encounter illness is simply one’s destiny. If even I and you cannot know it, how could physicians or shamans? Moreover, the song’s meaning was that neither I nor you could cause this illness, nor could shamans cure it.

The first was Master Jiao, the second Master Yu, and the third Master Lu—they diagnosed his illness. Master Jiao said to Ji Liang: “Your cold and warmth are unbalanced, your deficiency and excess out of measure. The illness stems from hunger and satiety, lust and desire, the scattering of essence and the turmoil of thoughts—neither Heaven nor ghosts are to blame. Though severe, it can be treated.” Ji Liang said: “A common physician!” and swiftly sent him away.

Master Yu said: “At your beginning, your fetal qi was insufficient, while your mother’s milk was excessive. This illness did not arise in a single day or night—its origins have grown gradually, and it cannot be cured.” Ji Liang said: “A fine physician!” and bade him stay to eat.

Master Lu said: “The illness of which Master Jiao spoke arises from human affairs and the misapplication of strength. The illness of which Master Yu spoke is born with the body, a congenital insufficiency of qi—it cannot be remedied.” Master Lu continued: “Your illness comes neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. From the moment of receiving life and form, there has been one who ordains it, and one who knows it. The division of life and death, the span of long and short—all are fixed by non-action, by the ordinance of Heaven’s principle. This is what the benighted find confounding, and what the profoundly enlightened come to understand. What can medicine or stone do for you?”

Ji Liang said: “A divine physician!” and sent him away with generous gifts. Soon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved of itself.

Master Lu said: “The illness of which I spoke arises from the spirit. What the spirit creates may bring merit or fault. The spirit is the vessel through which the divine repays—it is the spirit that ordains. Before form was received, the spirit already knew. When the spirit is insufficient, the form follows. Long or short, beautiful or ugly—one’s material form is already determined. How could medicine or stone cure this?”

Ji Liang, taking him for a divine physician, cultivated the spirit and nurtured virtue, and his illness healed itself.

Fan said: “Movement and transgression give rise to illness. A physician may cure those who are ill and await treatment, but it is better to hear of it and take medicine beforehand. Yet for illnesses that come without cause, do not take medicine. Even when one is ill, if one can speak of the illness, there is hope for recovery—yet such cases cannot be treated with medicine or stone.”

Ji Liang’s illness worsened over seven days. His sons gathered around him, weeping—such is the confusion and attachment of ordinary men. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu: “My sons are so profoundly unworthy. Why do you not sing for them to enlighten them?” He wished to impress upon them the principle of life and death to awaken them. Yet their simple, rustic hearts remained unchanged, so he summoned three physicians.

Master Jiao went against the principle of life and nature in attempting to treat it, so he was called a common physician. Master Yu followed the natural course of life and did not seek to cure it, so he was called a fine physician. As for Master Lu, he traced things back to their origin and returned to their end, knowing there was one who silently ordained them. Decoctions and acupuncture could add nothing more—who but one who transcends skill and aligns with the divine could reach such understanding? Thus Ji Liang took him for a divine physician.

In ancient times, when illness entered the spirit or settled in the vital organs, even divine physicians deemed it incurable and trusted in this—was this not akin to Master Lu’s approach?

Life is not preserved by esteem, nor is the body enriched by love. Life is not cut short by contempt, nor is the body diminished by neglect. Thus, esteem may not preserve life, nor contempt bring death; love may not enrich, nor neglect diminish. This appears contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, arise of themselves. Esteem may bring life, or contempt death; love may enrich, or neglect diminish. This appears natural, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, still arise of themselves.

Fan said: “Life is not yours to possess—it is the harmony bestowed by Heaven and Earth. The body is not yours to possess—it is the form entrusted by Heaven and Earth. Whether one lives or dies, whether one is enriched or diminished—how can man defy this? All is simply natural.”

Yuxiong said to King Wen: “Yuxiong was King Wen’s teacher. What is long is not thereby increased, what is short is not thereby diminished. What is lost to calculation—what can be done about it?” *Calculation here means wisdom.*

Master Lu said: “If one knows the retribution of form, one acts without private sentiment. Private sentiment is what gives rise to esteem and love, contempt and neglect. The body does not follow the thickness or thinness of sentiment—what seems to follow or oppose, to be contradictory or natural, is in truth neither. It is like length and beauty—how could they be altered by sentiment or love? They are beyond the reach of wisdom and calculation.”

Fan said: “Though the crane’s neck is long, to sever it brings sorrow—this is not to increase it. Though the teal’s legs are short, to lengthen them brings grief—this is not to diminish them. Length and shortness stand in relation to one another, with a fixed number between them. Even the most skilled reckoner cannot calculate it—how much less the ordinary man? Thus, the great tree and the morning mushroom differ in duration, Pengzu and the short-lived child differ in lifespan. In the unseen, all has its fixed portion—how can it be perceived by calculation?”

Laozi said to Guan Yin: “Who knows the reason for Heaven’s dislikes?” Wang Bi said: “Who can know Heaven’s intent? Only the sage.” To anticipate Heaven’s will, to weigh advantage and harm, is not as good as ceasing. One who follows Heaven’s principle without intent cannot be violated by ghosts or spirits, nor disrupted by human affairs. But to anticipate Heaven’s will, to calculate fortune and misfortune, to act in accord with the natural while avoiding the contrary, to pursue advantage and shun harm—this merely sets one in great opposition to adversity and misfortune. It is the height of cleverness in the use of wisdom, yet it cannot prevent the arising of good and ill fortune, nor the exhaustion of blessing and calamity.

Master Lu said: “How can one who does not know the Way know what Heaven loves or hates? To anticipate Heaven’s will, to weigh advantage and harm in service of private sentiment, is to fail to follow principle and entrust oneself to fate. This chapter speaks of how strength cannot defy destiny, and destiny cannot be foreknown. To entrust oneself to it is to be late; to strive against it is to defy destiny—thus one is shamed.”

One who knows the Way cultivates the spirit and nurtures the true. One who creates karma at the outset strives to alter destiny—this is to seek to shorten what Heaven has ordained.

Under the *Zhenghe* reign: When destiny is constrained, even Heaven cannot know it—how much less can man? If blessings do not come from Heaven, and misfortunes do not arise from man, then fortune and misfortune are but what one summons, and calamity and auspiciousness respond in kind. They are neither Heaven’s private favor nor something man can bring about. Diviners and physicians are but the basest of craftsmen, yet even wisdom cannot know what destiny constrains. When illness strikes and one seeks a physician, does one suppose the physician truly knows? There are three schools of medicine: the Jiao, the Yu, and the Lu. The Jiao school speaks of resisting and treating; the Yu school, of following and regulating; the Lu school, of unifying principle and obscuring distinctions.

For instance, when cold and heat are imbalanced, deficiency and excess are disordered, one knows the illness lies in man alone—yet failing to comprehend destiny, this is the way of resisting and treating. When prenatal qi is insufficient and breast milk excessive, one knows the illness is received from Heaven alone—accepting it as destiny, this is the way of following and regulating. If illness does not arise from Heaven, it is not what the Yu school can treat; if illness does not lie in man, it is not what the Jiao school can attack. When none know why things are as they are, this is destiny at work—what use are medicines and stones? This is what it means to unify principle and obscure distinctions, and such a one is rightly called a divine physician.

Those who prize life nourish the form to preserve life; those who cherish the body do not harm it through nurture. Yet this is not the way to perfect the body and cultivate life. For in pursuing things, one cannot avoid endangering the body; in living with sorrow and anxiety, one cannot escape harming life and body. Only one who does not treat life as something to be prized surpasses those who prize it. For life is not preserved by valuing it, nor cut short by despising it. Only one who forgets the body can be free from harm, for the body is not made substantial by cherishing it, nor diminished by slighting it.

Thus, prizing life may not preserve it, despising it may not end it; cherishing the body may not make it flourish, slighting it may not make it wither. From the perspective of constant principle, this seems contradictory, yet accepting destiny, it is not. Some prize life and live, some despise it and die; some cherish the body and it flourishes, some slight it and it withers. From the perspective of changing principle, this seems natural, yet constrained by destiny, it is not. All this arises of itself, so it is said: one lives or dies, flourishes or withers, of itself.

Yu Xiong said: “What is long is not made so by addition; what is short is not made so by reduction.” What is natural cannot be increased or diminished. The *Classic* says: “What Heaven detests—who knows the reason?” What is natural cannot be fathomed. This is why the true person of old did not destroy destiny for the sake of causes.

Fan said: “What is equal in man is equal in Heaven. What man deems beneficial, Heaven detests—who can know which to follow? Anticipating Heaven’s will, weighing advantage and harm, wisdom may yet falter. This is why foresight is the flower of the Way and the beginning of folly. Heaven’s workings are soundless and scentless—how can they be hastily measured? Thus it is said: ‘Better to desist.’”

Yang Bu was the younger brother of Yang Zhu. He asked: “Consider two men here: in years, they are brothers; in speech, they are brothers; in talent, they are brothers; in appearance, they are brothers. Yet in longevity and early death, they are father and son; in nobility and lowliness, father and son; in fame and reputation, father and son; in love and hatred, father and son. I am perplexed.”

Master Lu said: “In years, speech, talent, and appearance, they are alike—hence brothers. In longevity and early death, nobility and lowliness, they are vastly different—hence father and son. This is the unknowability of destiny, so you are perplexed.”

Yangzi said: “The ancients had a saying I once understood and shall tell you: ‘What is not known to be so yet is so—this is destiny.’ The principle of spontaneity cannot be known by wisdom. Now, in confusion and obscurity, in tangled disorder, whether one acts or does not act, days pass and return—who knows the reason? It is all destiny.”

Master Lu said: “What the multitude does not know they take as natural: in confusion and obscurity, days passing and returning, ceaseless in motion—do they take this as destiny? One who trusts in destiny denies longevity and early death; if there are longevity and early death, it is not destiny. One who trusts in principle denies right and wrong; if there are right and wrong, it is not principle. One who trusts in the heart denies adversity and favor; if there are adversity and favor, it is not the heart. One who trusts in nature denies safety and danger; if there are safety and danger, it is not *zhu* [nature]. Then one may speak of having nothing to trust, nothing not to trust. Principle, too, has no trust or distrust.

Truly sincere and earnest—what to leave, what to approach? What to grieve, what to rejoice? What to do, what not to do? If principle has no heart, then there is nothing not done, and nothing done.”

Master Lu said: “Longevity and early death are destiny; right and wrong are principle; adversity and favor are the heart; safety and danger are nature. If one who trusts in destiny denies longevity and early death, one who trusts in principle denies right and wrong, one who trusts in the heart denies adversity and favor, one who trusts in nature denies safety and danger—then one may speak of having nothing to trust, nothing not to trust, and thus attains the true Way. What to leave, what to approach? What to grieve, what to rejoice? What to do, what not to do? This is the ultimate Way.”

Fan said: “Brothers are of heaven’s bonds—this is why we speak of their sameness. Father and son are of heaven’s ties—this is why we speak of their difference. Consider this man: though their years are equal, their longevity and early death differ; though their words are equal, their nobility and baseness differ; though their talents are equal, their fame and repute differ; though their appearances are equal, their love and hatred differ. What causes this? It is simply the natural course. The principle of the natural course cannot be fathomed, so in dimness and obscurity, one remains in darkness alone, with nothing to be seen; in confusion and disorder, one follows along alone, with nothing to oppose. Whatever is done, whatever is not done, I harbor no intent. Knowing that going and coming are not of the self, the heart’s deliberations are not disturbed—who then can know its cause? That which arrives without knowing how is fittingly ascribed to destiny. Thus, one who trusts in destiny denies longevity and early death, and Peng and Shang’s fixed allotments become one thread; one who trusts in principle denies right and wrong, and Yao and Jie’s natural sameness becomes one continuum; one who trusts in the heart denies adversity and favor, never turning from one to embrace the other; one who trusts in nature denies safety and danger, never departing from peril to seek safety. When the Way reaches this point, trust and distrust will also dissolve. Therefore, the true is but one and does not stray; the sincere is whole and solid, without flaw. Going and approaching, grief and joy—no distinctions remain. What to do? What not to do?”

Thus it shall transform of itself. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: "The perfected person dwells as though dead, moves as though a machine." This illustrates the ultimate of non-mind. They know not why they dwell, nor why they do not dwell; they know not why they move, nor why they do not move. They do not alter their countenance for the gaze of the multitude, nor do they claim that their countenance remains unchanged when none observe. They do not allow external things—sights or sounds—to alter their measure. Alone they come, alone they go, alone they enter, alone they depart—who can obstruct them? Things go, and they go; things come, and they come, letting things enter and depart as they will, thus nothing can obstruct them.

Lu says: "Dwelling as though dead" means having no mind. "Moving as though a machine" means employing mechanisms. Like a wooden figure’s movements—what knowledge does it possess? It lies neither in emotion nor in appearance, but only in spirit wandering free. Who could obstruct it?

In the *Zhenghe* edition: Brothers are spoken of in terms of the order of precedence; father and son, in terms of the hierarchy of rank. Talent, appearance, speech, and age belong to oneself; longevity and early death, nobility and lowliness, fame and reputation, love and hatred belong to the external. Years may be the same, yet longevity differs; words may be the same, yet reputation differs; talent may be the same, yet rank differs; appearance may be the same, yet love and hatred differ. All that belongs to oneself arises from what is inherently so, while what is external cannot be made certain. Principle has its natural course and its induced course—this is what is meant by "knowing not why it is so, yet it is so." Destiny, then, is that of which we know neither its natural nor its induced causes.

Dim and obscure, it cannot be made clear. Confused and shifting, it cannot be fixed. Following what is done, following what is not done, it responds without concealment. Day by day it departs, day by day it arrives, ever in motion yet never accumulating. In this manner, who can know it? Thus it is said: "Who knows its cause?" All is destiny.

Longevity and early death are not two; cultivate the self and await it—this is how one establishes destiny. Therefore, one who trusts in destiny denies longevity and early death. "Right and right, wrong and wrong" is called wisdom, and wisdom is what exhausts principle. Therefore, one who trusts in principle denies right and wrong. The human heart delights in compliance and rages at opposition—thus one who trusts in the heart denies adversity and favor. Human nature finds peace in what it attains and peril in what it loses—thus one who trusts in nature denies safety and danger. Trust means yielding to what is natural.

Though unified in trust, one is still bound. Only when there is neither trust nor distrust does one attain the utmost truth, free from delusion and flaw. In such sincerity, there is no entry where one does not find contentment. Thus it is said: "What to leave? What to approach? What to grieve? What to rejoice? What to do? What not to do?"

The perfected person dwells as though dead—this is called stillness without motion. When moving, they are like a machine—like the operation of a mechanism. They do not know why they dwell, nor why they do not dwell; though abiding in stillness, they have never clung to stillness, and the reason for their stillness remains unknown to them. They do not know why they move, nor why they do not move; though emerging in motion, they have never been swept away by motion, and the reason for their movement remains unknown to them. They do not alter their demeanor when observed by the multitude, nor do they remain unchanged when unobserved—thus the myriad forms cannot sway them. Alone they come, alone they go; alone they emerge, alone they enter. Their movement is present everywhere—who can obstruct them?

Master Fan says: Those who attained the Dao in ancient times came to rest in profound obscurity, standing like withered wood; they moved with effortless grace, trailing like a dead branch. In dwelling, they were unbound; in action, they pursued nothing. Truly, they never allowed the vicissitudes of external things to lodge as thorns in their hearts. Roaming within the Six Directions, wandering across the Nine Provinces, alone they came, alone they went; alone they emerged, alone they entered. None could pair with them—this is to cast off things and stand in solitude, to attain clarity at dawn and perceive the One. Who then could oppose the great Dao or invite trouble by colliding with its path?

Mo Yin: "Brow-tilted, stern, and sternly restrained."
Lu: "The appearance of silence, deception, and feigned foolishness."

Single sounds: *Zhàn* to *zhì*, *Dí*—
Lu: "The appearance of light, impulsive movement."

*Chǎnchǐ* to *xuānhuǎn*, *Xuányuán*—
Lu: "The appearance of meandering slowness."

*Biēfáng* to *mièfū*, sound *fū*—
All these are the guises of silent deception, sudden outbursts, sluggishness, and haste.
The four roamed together in the world, each following their own will;
though they spent their years side by side, they never knew one another’s hearts, each believing their own wisdom to be profound.
Lu: "Though they wandered together in the world, through all their years they never learned each other’s names, each convinced of their own excellence."

*Qiǎonìng*—
Lu: "The appearance of cunning flattery."

*Yúzhí*—
Lu: "The appearance of guileless simplicity."

*Nǎnzhuó* to *lüèzhuó*—
*Nǎnzhuó*: the look of one who fails to comprehend.
Lu: "The appearance of blunt obstinacy."

*Biànpì*—
Lu: "The appearance of fawning compliance."
The four roamed together in the world, each following their own will;
though they spent their years side by side, they never exchanged a word of their arts, each believing their own skill to be most subtle.
Lu: "Though they wandered together in the world, through all their years they never visited one another, each convinced of their own cunning."

Wondrous indeed!
*Kǔjiāo* to *kǔ*, *yá*—
Lu: "The appearance of stubborn defiance and unyielding force."

*Qínglù*—
Lu: "The appearance of unhidden feelings."

*Jiǎnjí*, sound *jiǎn*—
Lu: "The appearance of halting speech."

*Língsuì*, sound *suì*—
All these are the guises of sharp reproach, stammering hesitation, and contentious eloquence.
Lu: "The appearance of seizing an opening to censure another."
The four roamed together in the world, each following their own will;
though they spent their years side by side, they never came to mutual understanding, each believing their own talent to be perfectly realized.
Lu: "Each convinced of their own abilities."

*Miánmòdiǎn*—
*Niǎn*, *tújiǎn*—
Lu: "The appearance of lifeless dullness."

*Zhuìzhǐ* to *lěiwěi*, like *wěi*—
Lu: "The appearance of burdensome complexity."

*Yǒnggǎn*—
Lu: "The appearance of bold vigor."

*Qièyí*—
*Miánniǎn*: the look of one who fails to open or connect.
*Zhuìwěi*: the appearance of burdensome complexity.
Lu: "The appearance of timid indecision."
The four roamed together in the world, each following their own will;
though they spent their years side by side, they never reproached one another, each believing their own conduct to be free of fault.
Lu: "Each convinced they had attained the perfect mean."

*Duō’ǒu*—
Lu: "The appearance of harmonious conformity."

*Zìzhuān*—
Lu: "The appearance of self-reliance."

*Chéngquán*—
Lu: "The appearance of wielding power."

*Zhīlì*—
Lu: "The appearance of solitary integrity."
The four roamed together in the world, each following their own will;
though they spent their years side by side, they never glanced at one another, each believing the time to be perfectly suited to them.

These are the manifold dispositions—countenances not one in kind—yet all converge in the Dao, for this is where their fates return.
Lu: "Deceptive cunning, clever eloquence, foolish clumsiness, flattering sincerity—though their dispositions differ, all attribute it to fate. Such reasoning is unsound. Those who speak now say that the qi one receives is thick or thin, and thus their differences arise, all resigned to Heaven with nothing to be done. This is the view of the unknowing."

Thus the scholar who knows the Dao nurtures their spirit, preserves their true nature, transforms their thoughts, and alters their form. Their bodily frame is self-fashioned. They strengthen their conduct and shift their fate—all these are the splendid achievements of those who give life to life.

Yet if one relies on form to discern fate, then effort is no match for fate;
if one relies on effort to contend with form, then fate is no match for effort.

*Zhènghé*:
*Mòxī* speaks of one whose nature admits no passage;
*Dānzhì* speaks of one whose conduct finds its way;
*Chǎnxuān* describes the slowness of temperament;
*Biēfū* describes the urgency of the heart.
Those who believe their wisdom to be profound do so because each measures by what they know.

The cunning and flattering are deceitful;
the foolish and upright are sincere.
*Nǎnzhuó* is the name for unyielding resolve;
*biànpì* is the look of pliable compliance.
Those who believe their skill to be most subtle do so because each measures by what they can do.

*Kǔjiāo* conceals what is in the heart;
*qínglù* leaves nothing hidden in affairs.
*Jiǎnjí* is the height of stammering;
*língsuì* is the fluency of argument.
Those who believe their talent to be perfectly realized do so because each measures by what they have attained.

*Miánniǎn* seems to lack vigor in action;
*zhuìwěi* seems slow in speech.
The bold and daring press forward;
the timid and hesitant fall behind.
Those who believe their conduct to be free of fault do so because each measures by how they act.

Those who conform to the crowd are *duō’ǒu*;
those who stand apart are *zìzhuān*;
those who ride power act by clinging to influence;
those who stand alone dwell in solitude.
Those who believe the time to be perfectly suited to them do so because each measures by what they encounter.

These manifold abilities and dispositions arise from what the heart can do.
Since hearts differ, appearances are not uniform—
this is why they follow their own faces and bear different names and reputations.

Yet all who act must proceed from the Dao;
those who proceed from the Dao must heed their fate.
These manifold dispositions—some find their end, some go astray—
yet all equally proceed from the Dao and heed their fate.
Thus it is said: all converge in the Dao, for this is where their fates return.

Fan:
Diverse wills and thoughts—some find their end, some go astray;
varied paths and pursuits—some clash, some align.
Yet those who believe their wisdom to be profound spend their years without knowing one another’s hearts;
those who believe their skill to be most subtle spend their years without exchanging their arts;
those who believe their talent to be perfectly realized spend their years without mutual understanding;
those who believe their conduct to be free of fault spend their years without reproaching one another;
those who believe the time to be perfectly suited to them spend their years without glancing at one another.
The teeming manifold dispositions—each with its own countenance—
yet all roam together in the world, each following their own will.
Perhaps this is simply the result of following their true nature.

*Guǐguǐgūwēi*—
*Chéng* is *qiǎochéng*; *qiǎo*, pronounced *xiào*, means "to resemble."
Lu: "*Wēiwēi* is the appearance of one on the verge of desire;
*qiǎo* means 'to resemble.'"

At first, it is not truly success—*guǐguǐ* failure is but a semblance of failure, yet at first, it is not truly failure. The world speaks of near-gains and near-losses, yet in truth, there are scarcely any such things.

Lu says: One who desires success yet does not achieve it resembles success but is not success; one who nearly fails yet does not fail resembles failure but is not failure. Thus, delusion arises from semblance, for one is confused by success and failure and cannot discern the source of the error. The moment of semblance is obscure. If, in the midst of semblance, one is not obscured, *jì* means "convergence"—it speaks of the murky indistinction. Lu says: Human delusion arises from resemblance. If one does not comprehend, then all remains obscure. But if one perceives resemblance without obscurity, this is called clarity. Then one is not startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. Are misfortune and fortune truly external or internal? All is determined by the profound constancy of principle. Seeing their sudden rise, one calls them externally arrived; seeing their gradual manifestation, one calls them internally formed. Moving with the time, halting with the time—wisdom cannot comprehend it. Movement and stillness are not mine, so they are not what knowledge claims to grasp.

Lu says: What is called clarity is thorough understanding of one’s nature and penetration of the spirit. Here lies the source of strength, the completion of destiny. Thus, there is no external misfortune to fear, no inner fortune to rejoice in. Movement and stillness follow the time, requiring no calculation of wisdom.

*Zhenghe* says: *Guǐ* is the appearance of near-desire; *qiào* is the term for resemblance. *Guǐguǐ* success is near-success yet not success—thus it is called *qiào* success, for at first, it is not success. It resembles success but is not. *Guǐguǐ* failure is near-failure yet not failure—thus it is called *qiào* failure, for at first, it is not failure. It resembles failure but is not. Viewed by its traces, the moment of success or failure is as narrow as a hair’s breadth; viewed by principle, the slightest deviation swiftly leads a thousand *li* astray. This is why the benighted fall into delusion at the threshold of resemblance, never awakening. Thus it is said: Delusion arises from semblance, and the moment of semblance is obscure. Yet the vision of the enlightened is like the dawn breaking upon solitude. Therefore, in the midst of semblance, they are not obscured. The inception of success or failure brings no change to themselves—thus they are not startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. Movement and stillness do not transgress their time, nor do they cling to sentiment. Thus they move with the time, halt with the time—this is not something wisdom can grasp. Hence it is said: Wisdom cannot know it.

One who trusts destiny harbors no duality between self and other, no emotions of joy or fear. For one who maintains duality between self and other, it would be better to cover the eyes and plug the ears, to turn one’s back to the slope and face the moat—yet even then, one would not stumble or fall. This shows that relying on cunning calculation is inferior to following nature.

Lu says: If one can maintain no duality between self and other, then words of misfortune, regret, or shame do not arise. If one cannot know destiny and follow principle, then preserving the body and avoiding harm is already enough to escape collapse and ruin. Thus, people of the world never cease striving by force, yet cannot entrust themselves to destiny.

Fan says: The ten thousand things under heaven rise and fall in alternation, suddenly appearing and vanishing—mechanisms of success and failure follow one another endlessly. Thus, near-success is not truly success, but only *qiào* success; near-failure is not truly failure, but only *qiào* failure. At the threshold of resemblance, doubt lingers unresolved—here is the source of delusion. The sage perceives the endless transformations, recognizes the numerical patterns of fullness and emptiness, and remains transcendent and self-possessed, unburdened by things. Misfortune does not arrive, fortune does not come; movement and stillness follow the time without resistance. How could private wisdom intervene? Trusting destiny, there is no duality between self and other—nothing is done, yet all is naturally so.

Thus it is said: life and death follow destiny; if it were not so, the benevolent and wise would surely live long, while the cruel and foolish would surely die young—but this is not necessarily the case. Poverty and hardship follow the times; if it were not so, the diligent and frugal would surely grow rich, while the extravagant and indolent would surely remain poor—but this, too, is not necessarily the case.

Lu says: Zixia said, "Life and death are a matter of destiny; wealth and honor lie with Heaven." "Heaven" here means the times. When yang warmth spreads its *qi*, all things come to life. The sage appears at the opportune moment, and all beings with spirit flourish. What is fixed by the self is called destiny; what is reached by transformation is called the times. Those who resent early death do not understand destiny; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. These are all failures to recognize the principle of naturalness. To face death without fear when it is time, to remain untroubled in hardship—this is to know destiny and be at peace with the times.

Lu says: To know destiny and be at peace with the times is the greatest virtue. When the time comes, it cannot be met with resistance; when destiny arrives, it cannot be refused. Thus it is said: abide in the time and follow the natural course, and sorrow and joy cannot enter. Grief arises from resemblance, delusion from ignorance of the times.

*Zhenghe* says: That which is direct and without gap is called destiny. Thus, one who trusts destiny harbors no duality between self and other; to hold such duality is to introduce a gap. Those with intent cannot attain the Dao, while those who govern the Dao forget intent. Therefore, those with duality are no better than one who covers their eyes and plugs their ears, turns their back to the slope and faces the moat—yet does not fall. For one who covers their eyes and plugs their ears has dimmed their clarity; one who turns their back to the slope and faces the moat has nothing to look back upon. In this way, shock and fear do not enter the heart, and thus they do not fall. Though they have not yet fully grasped destiny, they are still better off than those who do not.

"Life and death follow destiny" means they are determined by that which is beyond the self. "Poverty and hardship follow the times" means what one encounters does not lie within the self. Destiny lies beyond, yet the noble person awaits it without doubt—how could one who resents early death understand destiny? The times lie beyond, yet the noble person waits for them without complaint—how could one who resents poverty understand the times? Only one who faces death without fear treats life and death as day and night—this is one who knows destiny. One who remains untroubled in hardship treats poverty and prosperity as the sequence of cold and heat—this is one who is at peace with the times.

If a person of great wisdom weighs gains and losses, assesses emptiness and fullness, and measures human nature, they may succeed half the time. If a person of little wisdom does not weigh gains and losses, does not assess emptiness and fullness, and does not measure human nature, they may still succeed half the time. What difference is there between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, measuring and not measuring?

Lu says: One who predicts the affairs of the world and is correct half the time must be skilled in prediction. Yet one of little wisdom who does not predict may also succeed half the time—what difference is there? Only when there is nothing to weigh does one not labor the mind. When there is nothing not weighed, one relies on the mind’s knowledge—then one is whole and without loss. Yet this is neither true wholeness nor true loss. One is whole of oneself, perishes of oneself, loses of oneself. Wholeness does not come from the exertion of the mind, nor does failure arise from misconduct.

Lu says: Even if one strains the mind and exhausts the will to predict half correctly, it is still inferior to not predicting at all and preserving one’s life. Those who labor their thoughts do not understand destiny; those who make no predictions do not rely on their own strength. Those who do not rely on their own strength draw near to the Dao—thus, one must abandon the former and embrace the latter.

*Zhenghe* says: Affairs have gains and losses, principles have emptiness and fullness, human nature has sincerity and deceit—these are not things that great wisdom can measure, nor are they beyond the reach of little wisdom. This is why success and failure are each half. To insist that great wisdom must succeed is to deny early death; to insist that little wisdom must fail is to deny humanity. Thus it is said: What difference is there between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, measuring and not measuring? Only by merging them into one and entrusting them to their natural course can one approach the truth.

Fan says: Destiny may be heeded but not opposed; the times may be followed but not defied. Those who resent early death do not know destiny; those who resent poverty do not know the times. Only the noble person can know destiny and be at peace with the times. Thus, they regard life and death as the constant alternation of day and night—facing death without fear, never despising death; regarding poverty and prosperity as the sequence of cold and heat—remaining untroubled in hardship, never disdaining poverty. How could they exhaust their spirit in vain conjectures, forcing wisdom where none exists?

Duke Jing of Qi was traveling on Ox Mountain. Looking north over his capital, he wept and said: "How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I leave it and die? If the ancients had never died, where would I go from here?" Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju both wept with him, saying: "We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Even coarse meat and broken-down horses are gifts we receive—how could we wish to die? How much more so for our lord?" Only Yanzi laughed to the side.

The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: "Today I am overcome with sorrow. Kong and Ju weep with me, yet you alone laugh—why?" Yanzi replied: "If worthy rulers always preserved the state, the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still rule today. If brave rulers always preserved the state, Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still rule today. Had these rulers remained, Your Lordship would now be wearing a straw raincoat and hat, standing in the fields, concerned only with your affairs—when would you have had time to brood over death?"

Lu says: Those who speak of death and rebirth draw from Buddhist and Daoist texts, echoing Confucian teachings but never stating it plainly. Now, to say that Your Lordship would be standing in the fields wearing a straw raincoat and hat is to make the principle of life and death perfectly clear.

Thus we know that effort brings destiny to fruition, and only when destiny is fulfilled does life arise—here the workings of life’s perpetuation become visible. Then how could our lord have attained this position and stood in it? For it is but a succession of occupying and relinquishing. That our lord alone weeps for this is unkind. To see an unkind ruler and flattering, fawning ministers—when I behold these two, I cannot but laugh in secret.

Duke Jing felt ashamed and raised his cup to punish himself, then penalized his two ministers with two cups each.

*Zhenghe*: Master Yanzi said: "How excellent! In ancient times, death was the repose of the virtuous. Thus to weep was deemed unkind."

*Fan* said: Heaven and earth are without end, but human death has its appointed time. Wielding the instruments of this appointed time, one lodges within the boundless—suddenly, no different from a swift steed galloping past a crack. Then even a ruler who holds a state may long to preserve it—can he truly do so? Duke Jing wept on Ox Mountain, for he did not understand this; no wonder Master Yanzi laughed in secret.

There was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died yet he felt no sorrow. His steward said: "Your Lordship’s love for your son was unmatched in the world. Now that he has died, why do you not grieve?" Dongmen Wu replied: "I was once without a son, and in that time of childlessness I felt no sorrow. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?"

*Zhenghe*: "Children and grandchildren are not your own; they are the cast-off husks of Heaven and Earth. Their coming cannot be refused, their going cannot be halted—thus to have a child is no cause for joy, and to lose a child is no cause for distress. Without penetrating the truth of life and destiny, how could one attain this?"

The farmer hastens to the season, the merchant pursues profit, the artisan chases skill, the official chases power—circumstance compels them. Yet the farmer meets with flood or drought, the merchant with gain or loss, the artisan with success or failure, the official with favor or disfavor—destiny compels them. This is the dark workings of nature.

*Lu* said: "Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—each pursues profit and chases power through their own effort. But flood or drought, success or failure, favor or disfavor lie beyond what effort can achieve; thus one entrusts oneself to destiny and finds peace. This is to gather one’s fallen elms without harming the sheltering tree. Yet people all call what cannot be helped ‘destiny.’ Those who do not strive with effort are deluded by what seems like attainment.

Dongmen Wu was skilled at resting in destiny, but not at understanding it. If the living possess life, and the living grasp what creates their destiny, how could they willingly entrust their destiny to the living? They grasp what brings the succession of occupying and relinquishing. One who truly understands destiny entrusts it to fate while still exerting effort."

*Zhenghe*: "Power lies with man; destiny lies with Heaven. What lies with man can be achieved through effort; what lies with Heaven cannot be attained through effort. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—these four encompass all the people under Heaven. They hasten to the season, pursue profit, chase skill, and seek power—this is what we can do. Flood or drought, gain or loss, success or failure, favor or disfavor—this is what we cannot do. What we can do lies with man; what we cannot do lies with Heaven. Man’s inability to overcome Heaven has been so for ages. Thus Liezi concludes his discourse on effort and destiny with this."

*Fan* said: "To hasten is to pursue at a measured pace; to chase is to pursue more urgently. Those who open land and plant grain are called farmers, thus what they hasten to is the season. Those who circulate goods and sell wares are called merchants, thus what they pursue is profit. Artisans gather in government offices to discuss techniques, so they merely chase skill. Scholars gather in banquets to discourse on benevolence and righteousness, so they merely chase the times. Day and night they engage in these pursuits, never turning aside to other things—circumstance compels them. But when farmers meet with flood or drought, merchants with gain or loss, artisans with success or failure, officials with favor or disfavor, this is not due to circumstance but to destiny at work."

Master Heguang’s Collection
Yang Zhu’s Chapter, with Zhang’s Commentary:

What is life? A momentary gathering of qi, a fleeting spark of awareness in a single thing. What gathers will scatter, what flickers will return to emptiness. Yet all things share one constant nature: they shun toil and crave ease. Thus, what delights them in life is nothing more than rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful forms, and harmonious sounds. But then they cannot freely follow what soothes their nature or pleases their senses. Instead, they use benevolence and righteousness as bolts, ritual and music as sashes, withering themselves in their prime while chasing posthumous fame—this is to miss the true joy of living.

Lu’s Commentary:
The noble pursue fame, the base pursue profit; both fame and profit are passions that drown men, what the vulgar world contends for. Thus, one who embodies the Dao does good without seeking renown, avoiding what the crowd competes for; does ill without courting punishment, shunning what the crowd condemns. To violate the Dao for fame or drown in passion for desire is to lose the mean—hence the man of Dao dwells not there. This teaching seems perverse, and scholars often doubt it. Yet how does the *Yang Zhu* chapter differ from the way of Robber Zhi?

Zhenghe’s Commentary:
When sagely kings do not arise, recluses offer reckless opinions to flatter their own tastes. Lie Yukou saw how heterodox doctrines obscured one corner of the truth, and how scholars of the age, unlucky not to see the vastness of heaven and earth, had torn the Dao into fragments for the world. Thus, he spoke out to refute them.

Fan’s Commentary:
Those who serve cunning and deceit to seize the times do so through power, disrupting their natural allotment. Those who violate their innate truth to chase falsehoods do so through forced restraint, harming their bodily life.

Only these two paths both deviate from the central Way. Thus, the *Strength and Fate* chapter pushes all to their allotted fate, while the *Yang Zhu* chapter exalts only unbridled indulgence. Some suppose these two doctrines clash, unlike the teachings of a single school—how could they know the intent of the perfected in setting forth their words is to preserve both without discarding either?

Yang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged with the Meng family. Meng asked him: “Man is but man—why strive for fame?”
Yang Zhu replied: “Those who seek fame do so for wealth.”
“Once wealthy, why not stop?”
“For honor.”
“Once honored, why not stop?”
“For death.”
“Once dead, what then?”
“For descendants.”
Yet those who endlessly pursue affairs never satisfy their desires. What benefit does fame bring to descendants?
Yang Zhu said: “Fame torments the body and scorches the heart. Fame seeks truth through falsehood, summons reality through emptiness, and forces conduct against one’s nature—how could it not bring ruin through care and sorrow? Yet those who ride fame bring blessings to their clans, profit to their villages, and all the more to their descendants.”

Fan’s Commentary:
Fame is a public vessel—one cannot take too much of it. Thus, those who maim their lives and harm their natures, offering themselves as sacrifices, are what the perfected deeply lament. Yet with fame comes honor, without it comes disgrace. That one’s name goes unspoken after death is what the noble man detests. Thus, to seek wealth and honor in life and leave it to descendants after death, fame cannot be entirely abandoned. All who pursue fame must be incorruptible—yet incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who pursue fame must yield—yet yielding leads to lowliness. These are the words of a troubled household. Now, one may have the fame of generosity and yielding yet still suffer poverty and lowliness—this is doing good without seeking profit.

Lu’s Commentary:
In this world of men, there is only fame and profit. The sage uses fame and profit as hooks: petty men die for profit, noble men die for fame—none fail to reach their end. Though good and evil differ, both involve seeking. Yet those who seek fame and succeed—do they not gain wealth and honor, bringing glory to descendants and profit to their villages? Though they torment body and heart, toil in incorruptibility and yielding, their aspirations have their hopes and their passions their forgetfulness—both lose the mean.

It is said: When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, if his lord was dissolute, he too was dissolute; if his lord was extravagant, he too was extravagant. He did not claim sole credit for good or evil. His will aligned with his lord’s words, and the Way was practiced—Qi became a hegemon. Yet after his death, only the Guan family remained.

Lu’s Commentary:
The profit of true fame is meager. When the Tian family served as ministers of Qi, if their lord was full, they diminished themselves; if their lord took, they gave. This was shifting blame to the lord. The people all turned to them, and thus they took Qi for themselves. Their descendants enjoyed it, and it continues unbroken to this day.

Lu’s Commentary:
The profit of false fame is deep. If true fame brings poverty, false fame brings wealth. Doing good without seeking fame, yet naturally arising—this is true fame. Seeking fame to attract profit, yet the world remains unaware—this is false fame. False fame is what brings profit.

It is said: Truth has no fame, fame has no truth. Fame is but falsehood. Without falsehood, one cannot attract profit.

Lu’s Commentary:
Those who act with truth have no fame; those who seek fame have no truth. Thus, without falsehood, profit does not become manifest. Formerly, Yao and Shun falsely yielded the world to Xu You and Shan Juan yet did not lose the world, enjoying a reign of a hundred years. The traces of falsehood and truth arise from circumstances. Those who create falsehood follow the traces of Yao and Shun, yet the sage has no falsehood. Boyi and Shuqi truly yielded the rule of Guzhu yet ultimately lost their state, starving to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and falsehood is as clear as this. *Sheng* means to examine.

Lu’s Commentary:
The false seek fame without truth; the true act with truth yet forget fame. The contrast between Yao, Shun, Boyi, and Shuqi is so luminous—yet the traces of truth and falsehood are not easily examined! If the world’s people do not lose their truth by chasing fame and profit, they drown in passions and forget the Way. The good are few in the world, the ungood many—thus those who chase fame are rare, while those who follow desires are legion. Even the wise can do nothing about it, for both lose the mean.

Zhenghe’s Commentary:
The sage has no fame, yet others give him fame—thus all so-called fame is but a guest to truth. The worthy chase fame, yet fame may exceed truth—thus so-called fame is often taken through falsehood. Nevertheless, the sages of old did not act as vessels for fame, only fearing that fame would burden them. Once fame exists, how can truth and falsehood be distinguished? Thus, some gain fame through truth, some through falsehood; some use truth to create falsehood, some use falsehood to create truth. Yet Guan Zhong and the Tian family still contend with Yao, Shun, Boyi, and Shuqi over the distinctions between truth, falsehood, fame, and reality—this is why the *Zhuangzi*’s discussion of nurturing life desires that one do good without drawing near to fame.

Fan’s Commentary:
Generosity without seeking may not avoid poverty; yielding without contention may not avoid lowliness—if so, what benefit is fame? Yet fame is one, though truth and falsehood differ. True fame brings poverty, as with Guan Zhong; false fame brings wealth, as with Tian Cheng. Extending this upward, if Yao and Shun yielded the world, or Boyi and Shuqi yielded their state—some did not lose the world but enjoyed a hundred years of emolument, while others lost their state and starved to death—is this not also a matter of truth and falsehood?

Yang Zhu said: “A hundred years is the greatest span of life. Of a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, half is spent in infancy and senility. Half of what remains is lost to nightly sleep and daily oblivion. Half of what remains is consumed by pain, illness, sorrow, loss, care, and fear.”

Within the span of a decade or so, one may find fleeting moments of ease and self-contentment, free from the slightest care—yet even these endure but a brief while. Then for what does man live? What joy does he seek? It is for rich pleasures, for sounds and sights. Yet rich pleasures cannot always sate, nor sounds and sights always delight. Thus one is further bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or restrained by fame and law; anxiously vying for an ephemeral reputation in one’s time, scheming for posthumous glory; fretfully conforming to what the ears and eyes perceive, clinging to the judgments of body and mind—all the while forfeiting the supreme joy of one’s prime, unable to indulge even for a moment. How does this differ from a prisoner weighed down by fetters?

*Yi* (异) here means "to differ"—an ancient character.

Lu observes: The common crowd all take a hundred years as the span of a lifetime, yet even this is diminished by the sorrows and toils of day and night. Moments of unburdened contentment are few. The joys one seeks are no more than sensual pleasures and fine flavors, yet these are constrained by rewards, punishments, fame, and moral teachings, preventing the free expression of one’s nature. How then does this differ from being shackled in prison? Such are the words of those ensnared by emotion.

*Zhenghe* cites *Zhuangzi*: "The supreme joy in ordering one’s life lies only in non-action, where something of the self may yet remain." Man’s life is born with care; what he delights in is bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beauty, and music. If the body knows no comfort, the mouth no rich taste, the form no fine attire, the eyes no beauty, the ears no music, then great anxiety and fear arise. One toils a lifetime in pursuit of the supreme joy, yet the joy thus attained is but meager. Therefore, only one who takes no joy as joy attains the supreme joy. Now, if one is urged or restrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or withdrawn by fame and law, conforms to what the ears and eyes perceive, and clings to the judgments of body and mind—all in pursuit of one’s own joy—how does this differ from a prisoner weighed down by fetters? How can such a life truly nourish the self?

The people of high antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn, and death a brief departure. That life is a fleeting arrival and death a long departure is common talk. Yet to say that death is also a "brief departure" may, at first glance, seem a textual error. However, the overarching theme of this work holds that existence and annihilation, form and qi, alternate and continue; life and death transform without ceasing. This principle has already been expounded in detail in the commentary on the "Heavenly Tally" chapter. Thus, one follows the heart’s impulses without resisting what is naturally desired; the joys of the present are not to be forsaken, and so one is not swayed by the allure of fame. Those who do good do not seek fame. One roams in accord with nature without opposing what all things desire; posthumous renown is not to be pursued, and so one is not subject to punishment. Those who do evil do not invite punishment.

Fame before or after, the length or brevity of life—these are not matters of concern.

Lu says: The people of high antiquity acted in accordance with the mean. That which is born and dies is form; that which emerges into life and enters death is spirit. Knowing that life and death are but brief arrivals and departures, one does not hastily seek fame. Knowing that spirit is neither born nor dies, one does not anxiously strive for the Dao. Thus, one follows the heart’s impulses without resisting what is naturally desired—merely delighting the self. What need is there for fame? One roams in accord with nature without opposing what all things crave—merely pleasing the self. What fear is there of punishment? Therefore, fame and reputation, whether before or after, and the length of life are not matters of calculation. To delight the self and please the mind is to act in harmony with the Dao, not to be drowned in emotion.

*Zhenghe* notes: To die here is not necessarily not to be born elsewhere; thus, life and death are but fleeting transitions. The heart may arise and cease, but nature suffers no gain or loss. Therefore, one who follows the heart’s impulses does not forsake the joys of the present; one who roams in accord with nature does not seek posthumous fame. To follow the heart’s impulses without resisting what is naturally desired is to act in accordance with what is inherently so within oneself. To act in accord with nature without opposing what all things desire is to follow what is spontaneously so in the external world. Not to be swayed by the allure of fame is what *Zhuangzi* calls "not drawing near to fame"; not to be subject to punishment is what *Zhuangzi* calls "not drawing near to punishment." For such a one, posthumous fame is certainly not a concern, nor do the joys of the present become a burden. Then how could one trouble oneself over fame before or after, or the length of life?

Fan says: Man’s life in the world is like a bubble on water—born, it transforms and dies; formed, it swiftly decays. Dying, it transforms and is born; decayed, it swiftly forms anew. Only by tracing things to their origin and returning to their end can one understand the discourse on life and death. To follow the heart’s impulses and roam in accord with nature is to not forsake the joys of the present. One who does good does so without drawing near to fame, and thus is not swayed by its allure. Posthumous fame is not to be pursued, and so one is not subject to punishment. Fame and reputation, whether before or after, and the length of life are never entertained in the mind. Why then would one be constrained, anxious, or hurried, placing oneself in the bonds of a prisoner weighed down by fetters?

Yang Zhu said: What distinguishes all things is life; what they share is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are their distinctions. In death, there is putrefaction and dissolution—this they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base are not of one’s own making; putrefaction and dissolution are also not of one’s own making. Thus, life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies; worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish; nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base. All is spontaneous, not the work of one’s own ability. Yet all things equally live, equally die, are equally worthy, equally foolish, equally noble, equally base—all return alike to spontaneity.

Ten years, and one dies. A hundred years, and one dies. The benevolent sage dies, the cruel fool dies. Alive, they may be Yao and Shun; dead, they are but rotting bones. Alive, they may be Jie and Zhou; dead, they are but rotting bones. Rotting bones are all the same—who knows their distinctions? Moreover, one should hasten to the present life—why idle over what comes after death? This mocks those deluded by postmortem reckoning.

Not scheming for what came before, not fretting over what comes after, without clinging to the present—this is the perfection of virtue.

Lu said: Life is the recompense of a single body; death is the end of that recompense. Worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness—these are the distinctions of living things, hence their differences. Putrefaction and dissolution—these are the constants of dead things, hence their sameness. The world points to form as death, yet in life, none know there is spirit beyond form. When the spirit departs, all is ignorance. Thus, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness, putrefaction and dissolution—none are of form’s own making. If not of its own making, then the essence of all living things has never not been equal. People know what is equal but not what makes them distinct. Thus, they vie in the present life and have no leisure to nurture what gives them life. This is why those who embody the Dao differ from such pursuits.

*Zhenghe*: Those who grasp the truth of life know that life comes but briefly—how much less should they exhaust themselves over death? Knowing that life must end, that all beginnings have an end, equalizing life and death, sameness and foolishness, nobility and baseness—then a hundred cares become one. To scheme for what comes after death is delusion.

Fan said: Bound by the mechanisms of yin and yang, molded in the crucible of creation, treating the body as a great affliction, life as finite—unable to delight the mind or nurture longevity—these are not those who have mastered the Dao. Why? Worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness differ in life, but in death, all share putrefaction and dissolution. Ten years, and one dies; a hundred years, and one dies—Peng Zu and the short-lived child have no difference in duration. The benevolent sage dies, the cruel fool dies—Confucius and Robber Zhi have no distinction between good and evil. Who would then sacrifice the body to pursue posthumous glory?

Yang Zhu said: Bo Yi was not without desire—his pride in purity led him to starve to death. Zhan Ji was not without emotion—his pride in chastity led him to a childless lineage. Such errors of purity and chastity—goodness taken to this extreme! These are words that slander the worthy and betray reality. Yet to praise or blame, one must direct judgment toward the loftiest.

Lu said: Such excess in pursuing reputation to this end is not how one embodies truth, perfects the Dao, forgets fame, and realizes reality.

*Zhenghe*: People cannot be without desire—being human, how can they lack emotion? Thus, desire and human emotion exist. Bo Yi’s pride in purity was not without desire; Zhan Ji’s pride in chastity was not without emotion. Yet they starved to death, left their lineage barren—this is not what is meant by "not allowing likes and dislikes to internally harm the body, always following spontaneity without forcing life."

Fan said: Bo Yi’s starvation and Zhan Ji’s childlessness were not free from pride—this merely critiques the traces of their conduct to correct the flaw of seeking fame. Those who read this text must grasp the meaning beyond the words.

Yang Zhu said: Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu; Zigong prospered in Wei. Poverty harmed his life; prosperity burdened his body. If poverty is not permissible, nor is prosperity—where then lies the permissible? It lies in delighting in life, in easing the body. Thus, those who delight in life do not suffer poverty—they suffice in what sustains them, never lacking. Those who ease the body do not seek prosperity—they do not labor the mind to amass wealth.

Lu said: Clinging to poverty without striving harms life; amassing wealth for survival burdens the body. Only those who embody the Dao neither seek wealth to ease the body nor cling to poverty to afflict life. They delight in the Dao, preserve truth, and respond to things without obstruction.

*Zhenghe*: Those who honor life, though rich and noble, do not harm the body with excess; though poor and lowly, do not burden form with profit. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life because he burdened his form with profit; Zigong’s prosperity burdened his body because he harmed himself with excess. Sorrowing over the body, injuring life with grief and distress—this is not delighting in life. Thus, those who truly delight in life do not suffer poverty. Wearing out the body, falling ill, amassing wealth without using it—this is not easing the body. Thus, those who truly ease the body do not seek prosperity.

Fan said: Yuan Si sat alone in his walled hut—his poverty was evident. Zigong traded wealth between Qi and Lu—his prosperity was evident. These two, one harmed life, the other burdened the body—I do not see how either is permissible.

Yang Zhu said: An ancient saying goes: The living cherish one another; the dead abandon one another. This saying is perfect. The way of cherishing is not merely emotion—it is diligence that brings ease, hunger that brings fullness, cold that brings warmth, poverty that brings success. The way of abandonment is not without sorrow—it is not burying pearls and jade, not clothing in patterned silks, not offering sacrifices, not preparing funerary objects.

Lu said: Knowing the way of cherishing and abandonment as perfect, yet none can attain it—why? Cherishing lies in sustaining and aiding life; abandonment lies in not burdening form. This is the utmost appropriateness. If in life one cannot sustain and secure it, yet in death vainly buries treasures to dazzle with fame, inviting bandits to inflict further harm—this is to lose what is fitting.

*Zhenghe*: In all under heaven, only reality and sincerity matter. Diligence that brings ease, hunger that brings fullness, cold that brings warmth, poverty that brings success—this is the reality of cherishing.

Not interring pearls and jade, not clothing in patterned silks, not offering sacrifices, not preparing funerary objects—this is the sincerity of abandonment.

Fan said: Those who cherish in life seem to delight in life; those who abandon in death seem to detest death. The ways of life and death differ, and one cannot truly regard them as one. Did Yangzi speak of this with some intent?

Yan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu said: Let it be unrestrained—do not obstruct or confine it. Yan Pingzhong said: What does that entail? Yiwu said: Indulge the ears in what they desire to hear, the eyes in what they desire to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it desires to speak, the body in what it desires to rest in, and the mind in what it desires to do.

Guan Zhong’s achievements resound in the world; as minister to Qi, he brought hegemony, acting through power and strategy. The way of effortless action was not his concern, nor did circumstances permit such words. Earlier, he urged Duke Huan to journey to the northern lands at life’s end—these were likely all allegories.

What the ears desire to hear is sound, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing hearing* (阏聪). What the eyes desire to see is beauty, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing sight* (阏明). What the nose desires to smell is fragrance, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing breath* (阏颤). What the mouth desires to speak is right and wrong, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing wisdom* (阏智). What the body desires is comfort, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing ease* (阏适). What the mind desires is freedom, yet if denied, it is called *obstructing nature* (阏性). All these obstructions are the tyranny of the ruler. *Tyranny* (废) means great

Liezi records this as an allegory meant to remedy prevailing ills. When Zichan served as minister of Zheng, he monopolized the state’s governance. After three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformative influence, while the wicked feared his prohibitions—Zheng thus achieved order, and the feudal lords stood in awe of it.

Yet Zichan had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was addicted to wine, Mu to sensual pleasures. In Chao’s chambers, a thousand *zhong* of wine were amassed, yeast piled like hills; from a hundred paces outside the gate, the reek of fermented mash assailed the nostrils. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, the regrets and resentments of human affairs, the presence or absence of kin within his household, the closeness or estrangement of his nine clans, or the sorrows and joys of life and death. Even if water and fire, blades and weapons clashed before him, he remained oblivious.

Mu’s rear courtyard contained dozens of adjoining chambers, each filled with young women of tender age and alluring beauty—*wǒ* (婑, pronounced *wūguǒ*) and *duò* (媠, pronounced *núzuò*). When he was engrossed in sensual indulgence, he shunned close kin, severed friendships, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, and even then, his desires remained unfulfilled. If a maiden of exquisite beauty appeared in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and relent only when he had secured her.

Zichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, saying: “I have heard that governing the self extends to the household, and governing the household extends to the state—this means proceeding from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my own household is in chaos. Is my Way perverse? What method can save these two brothers? I beg you to instruct them.”

Deng Xi replied: “I have long been perplexed by this but dared not speak first. Why not admonish them in due time, illustrating the weight of life and fate, and enticing them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”

Lu commented: “To illustrate life and fate and entice with ritual and righteousness is to curb their avaricious and dissolute impulses, tempting them with the allure of high rank and eminence—these are the worldly ends to which all aspire.”

Zichan heeded Deng Xi’s advice. Seizing an opportune moment, he visited his brothers and addressed them: “What elevates humans above beasts is wisdom and foresight. What wisdom and foresight guide is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and rank follow. If you act on impulse, indulging in desires, your lives will be imperiled. Heed my words, and by evening, you will enjoy emoluments.”

Chao and Mu replied: “We have long known this and long deliberated upon it. Yet affairs are multifarious, and we have simply chosen what we prefer. Why must we await your words to recognize it? Life is hard to attain but death comes easily. With a life so difficult to obtain, awaiting a death so easily reached—how can one not ponder this deeply? To exalt ritual and righteousness merely to impress others, or to feign a nature contrary to one’s true self for the sake of reputation—we deem this worse than death.

How profound are these words! As for those who painstakingly conform to convention, violate their nature to comply with external things, forfeit the fleeting joys of the present, and harbor lifelong sorrow—though their limbs remain intact, they are in truth as good as dead. We wish to exhaust life’s pleasures and plumb the depths of joy in our prime, fearing only that our bellies will burst from unrestrained drinking or our strength fail before we sate our passions. We have no leisure to fret over the tarnishing of our reputation or the peril to our lives.

Moreover, do you presume to dazzle others with your governance of the state, seeking to sway our hearts with honeyed words and delight our minds with honors and emoluments? Is this not contemptible and pitiable? We wish to part ways with you—*part ways* meaning to debate. Those skilled in governing externals may not bring order to things, yet their persons suffer toil; those skilled in governing the internal may not plunge things into chaos, yet their natures enjoy ease. Your method of governing externals may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our method of governing the internal can be extended to the world, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease.

We have long wished to expound this art to you, yet you instead seek to instruct us with that other art?” Zichan was left speechless, unable to respond.

Lu said: “Those who martyr themselves to passion and indulgence wield deceptive words and perverse arguments sufficient to silence the mouths of sages and disrupt the laws of the world. Thus, Jie and Zhou’s cunning was enough to adorn their wrongs, and Shaowao’s eloquence enough to delude the masses.”

Though they may not prevail in their own time, they stir the age with their advocacy. Thus, Confucius yielded to the arguments of Robber Zhi, and Zichan was confounded by the words of Chaomu—such setbacks are no cause for deep regret. Yet the deluded believe that Liezi acquiesced to indulge his passions, and Zhang Zhan annotated his text to elucidate its principles—these are but the vulgar predilections of the common crowd, how could they be the refined arts of the Dao’s lineage?

One day, he recounted this to Deng Xi, who replied: “You have dwelt with a true person and yet do not recognize him—who would call you wise? The governance of Zheng was merely fortuitous, not your achievement. Without knowing a true person, one cannot govern a state; those who govern states do so by chance alone.” This entire discourse is too blunt and unyielding, lacking the tone and spirit of a noble person. Yet its intent is to free those bound by self-imposed constraints, hence its occasional excesses.

Lu said: “When rewards are bestowed according to ability and appointments made by virtue, the worthy advance day by day while the unworthy retreat. To employ only by talent is to ensure the Way of the good flows unimpeded; to dismiss the unworthy is to leave the petty without grounds for resentment. If the worthy and unworthy each settle into their proper place and fulfill their aspirations, then the governance of Zheng would be fitting. Those two men—Chaomu and his like—indulge in wine and sensual pleasures, neglecting ritual and righteousness, neither relying on the influence of fathers and elder brothers to seize the moment nor restraining their hearts’ desires with remorse: these are truly *true persons*. Yet you seek to correct their conduct, mold their hearts, and seize emoluments and rank for private gain—this is but a state accidentally governed by principle, not your utmost impartiality. How can this be called wisdom? Such ‘true persons’ are not true sages but truly talentless men.”

*Zhenghe* commentary: Those who toil the body and startle the heart are enslaved by external forces; those who release the heart and free the body draw near to spontaneity. External forces breed delusion, while spontaneity preserves one’s authenticity. Chaomu, steeped in wine and sensuality, acted without regard for the disgrace of his reputation or the peril to his life—he was one who released the heart and freed the body, unburdened by constraints. Zichan, proud of his governance through ritual, righteousness, laws, and standards, forced his nature to conform to the allure of honor and emolument, ever fearful his person might go ungoverned—he was one who toiled the body and startled the heart, bound by constraints. The unburdened suffice to perfect their death; the constrained cannot delight in their life. Thus, those who labor the body and exhaust the life are deluded, while those who follow their passions and indulge their hearts are true.

Hence, Chaomu deemed his governance *internal* and Zichan’s *external*, saying: “Those skilled in governing the external may not bring order to things yet wear themselves out; those skilled in governing the internal may not plunge things into chaos yet enjoy ease in their nature.” Who but a true person could grasp this?

Fan said: “To govern a state with cunning is to plunder it; to govern a state without cunning is to bless it. Zichan was like the mother of the masses—able to feed them but not to teach them. Even the sage condemned the use of imperial carriages for crossing rivers; thus, in governing a state, he still fell short. Hence, he dwelt with a true person and did not recognize him.”

The true persons of old did not delight in life nor loathe death. They came serenely, they departed serenely. The pains of anguish, the ease of contentment—these did not register in their bodies. The fears of alarm, the joys of elation—these did not register in their hearts. When had they ever wearied the heart or labored the body to hazard their authenticity?

*The True Classic of Perfect Virtue, Expounded in Four Commentaries*, Scroll Eighteen.

Wei’s Duanmu Shu lived in the age of Zigong. Relying on his ancestral wealth, his family amassed ten thousand gold. He did not attend to worldly affairs but gave free rein to his desires. Whatever the people of his time wished to do, whatever men’s hearts longed to enjoy—he did it all, he indulged in it all. His walls and halls, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines—all rivaled the lords of Qi and Chu.

Whatever his nature craved, his ears wished to hear, his eyes wished to see, his mouth wished to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote regions, from places beyond Qi’s borders—he would inevitably procure it, as if it were but a thing within his garden walls. When he traveled, though mountains and rivers barred the way, though the roads were long and winding, he would inevitably go, as if it were but a step across the room. Guests filled his courtyard daily by the hundreds; his kitchens never ceased their smoke and fire; his halls and corridors never stilled their music.

From what remained after his own sustenance, he first distributed to his clansmen; from what remained after the clansmen, he next distributed to his village; from what remained after the village, he then distributed throughout the state. At sixty years of age, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs and dispersed all his storehouses—his treasures, jewels, carriages, robes, concubines, and attendants. Within a year, he had exhausted it all, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no medicines or stones in reserve; when he died, he had no funds for burial.

Those who understood the principle knew that the ten thousand things are impermanent, that wealth and goods are but temporary gatherings. Their accumulation was not his achievement, yet he fulfilled all proper sustenance. Their dispersal was not his gift, but rather revealed that things do not endure in one place. Such a man—could he be moved by fame or reputation, bound by ritual and law?

The people of the state who received his bounty pooled their resources to bury him and returned his wealth to his descendants. Qin Gu and Qu Li heard of this and said, “Duanmu Shu was a madman—he shamed his ancestors.” Duangan Sheng heard of it and said, “Duanmu was a man of understanding—his virtue surpassed his ancestors.” What he did, what he pursued, shocked the common mind, yet it was truly in accord with principle. The gentlemen of Wei, who clung to ritual and teaching, were fundamentally unable to grasp such a man’s heart.

**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**
To grasp the essence of life is to let it flow without obstruction; to know the fixity of one’s allotted share is to accumulate yet be able to disperse. Whatever one desires to do, one does without restraint; whatever the heart longs to enjoy, one enjoys without limit. To indulge the heart’s desires without hindrance—if this is not to be far from the true nature of life, what else could suffice? To scatter wealth among village and kin, to cast aside hoarded stores, to accumulate yet be able to disperse—if this is not to know the fixity of one’s allotted share, what else could suffice? To exhaust the joys of one’s years without heed for cares after death—only one who has attained understanding can fully comprehend this. Thus, to have no resources for burial is acceptable; for the people of the state to pool their means and bury him is also acceptable. Qin Gu and Qu Li, measuring his conduct by conventional virtue, deemed it a disgrace to his ancestors; Duangan Sheng, perceiving his heart through the virtue of understanding, saw that his power surpassed his ancestors’. To seek it externally is why the common mind is shocked; to seek it internally is why true principle affirms it. The gentlemen of Wei, clinging to ritual and teaching, were bound within the confines of form and appearance—how could they comprehend such a mind, and thus they were fundamentally unable to grasp this man’s heart?

**Fan’s Commentary:**
One who embodies the Dao regards things as transient lodgings, knowing that wealth and possessions are but temporary gatherings. To claim them as one’s own is delusion. Thus, one does not confine worldly profit to one’s private share. In this, Duanmu Shu may be said to have understood this truth.

Meng Sunyang asked Master Yang: “Suppose there were a man who prized life and cherished his body, seeking not to die—would that be acceptable?”
He replied: “In principle, there is no not-dying.”
“Then seeking long life—would that be acceptable?”
He replied: “In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by prizing it, nor is the body made substantial by cherishing it. Moreover, what is the purpose of long life? Even if one were granted long life, it would not be what one truly wished. The five passions of love and hate were the same in ancient times as now; the safety and peril of the four limbs were the same in ancient times as now; the joys and sorrows of worldly affairs were the same in ancient times as now; the shifts between order and chaos were the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these, having seen them, having experienced them, one finds even a hundred years wearisome in their excess—how much more the suffering of long life? The course of a single life is thus: now liking, now disliking; now at ease, now in peril, like an endless cycle. If one takes this as joy, then repeated experiences bring no renewed delight; if one takes this as suffering, then personal afflictions cannot be endured again. Thus, the longer one lives, the more sorrows accumulate.”

Meng Sunyang said: “If so, then swift death is preferable to long life. One could then walk upon blades or enter boiling water to achieve one’s aim.”
Master Yang replied: “Not so. Once born, one should let go and follow the course, pursuing one’s desires while awaiting death. One should simply give free rein to one’s nature and await the end. When death comes, one should let go and follow the course, pursuing one’s destined path to its final dissolution. Since control does not lie with oneself, there is nothing to cling to or regret. To let go of all, to follow all—why then hasten or delay between them?”

**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**
That there is life must mean there is death; that there is a beginning must mean there is an end—this is the natural principle. To prize the body and cherish life, seeking not to die—how could this be the understanding of one who has grasped principle? For where there is life, there is a return to non-life, so life is not preserved by prizing it; where there is form, there is a return to formlessness, so the body is not made substantial by cherishing it. To seek long life in this way is only to deepen one’s delusion. The passions of love and hate stir within; the safety and peril of the body press from without; worldly affairs of joy and sorrow burden the heart; the shifts between order and chaos move one’s conduct. From ancient times to the present, what one has heard, seen, and experienced can be foreseen and known in advance. Thus, a hundred years of life bring lifelong cares and not a single morning’s joy. One soon wearies of its length and suffers its duration—how then could one seek long life? This is why Meng Sunyang, upon hearing Master Yang’s words, wished for swift death. Yet while seeking long life is not the understanding of one who has grasped principle, desiring swift death is also not the penetration of the Dao—both are in error. Only by being born and then letting go, following one’s desires while awaiting death, can one avoid the affliction of harming life. When death comes, letting go and following one’s destined path to its final dissolution, one avoids the affliction of hating death. To live when one can live, to die when one can die, with life and death bringing no change to oneself—this is what it means to have attained understanding.

**Fan’s Commentary:**
One who prizes life does not harm himself, yet is enslaved by things—it seems as though he could preserve life, yet life is not preserved by prizing it. One who cherishes the body does not harm himself, yet is constrained by things—it seems as though he could make it substantial, yet the body is not made substantial by cherishing it. Though one may desire long life and not die, how can this be achieved? Moreover, the five passions of love and hate, the safety and peril of the four limbs, the joys and sorrows of worldly affairs, the shifts between order and chaos—all turn like a ring without end. Having lived long, having seen much, even a hundred years seem wearisome in their excess. The long-lived grow dull, and the longer one’s sorrows, the more unbearable not dying becomes. How far removed is this from the form one inhabits! Thus, not to covet long life is for good reason. Those who fail to grasp this deem swift death preferable to long life, walking upon blades or entering boiling water to achieve their aim. Yet they do not understand: once born, one should let go and follow the course, giving free rein to one’s nature without resistance. This is not to delight in life. When death comes, one should let go and follow the course, yielding to what is fitting without longing. This is not to hate death. To let go of all, to follow all, to dwell in accord with the times and rest in what is fitting, to fulfill what one has received from Heaven—why then hasten or delay between them?

Yang Zhu said: "Bo Chengzi Gao did not use even a single hair to benefit others, abandoning his state to plow in reclusion. Great Yu did not use even his own body for self-benefit, leaving one limb withered. The ancients would not yield even a single hair to profit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve a single body. If each person refrained from harming even a hair, and each person refrained from benefiting the world, the world would be well-ordered."

*Commentary (Zhenghe):* "Not using even a single hair to benefit others is self-regard. Not using even one’s own body for self-benefit is regard for others. One who regards others must not lose oneself; one who regards oneself must not lose others. To harm even a single hair to benefit the world—there are things one does not yield. To take the whole world to serve a single body—there are things one does not do. When the distinction between self and others is each satisfied and halted, then one’s regard for others is too little, and one’s self-regard is too much—this is certainly insufficient to govern the world. Yet Yang Zhu’s teachings uniquely reside in this: he is a scholar of one corner."

*Commentary (Fan):* "Bo Cheng abandoned his state to plow in reclusion—this is self-regard. Great Yu passed by his door without entering—this is regard for others. Though the traces of their conduct differ, their hearts of saving the world are one. The ancients would not give even the smallest thing to others if it were not righteous, not in accord with the Way—how much less a single hair? They would not take even the smallest thing from others if it were not righteous, not in accord with the Way—how much less the whole world? Yang Zhu’s conduct, in its excess of self-regard, refuses to pluck even a single hair to benefit the world—Mencius indeed likened him to beasts. Yet Liezi found something to take from him. At that time, the customs of the world were steeped in deceit and cunning, and simplicity and honesty had scattered. Even the learned scholars and great officials of the age did not know the Way of valuing oneself and devaluing things. Thus, they cast aside the threads of ritual and propriety, seized and snatched amid profit and harm, pursued gain without shame, and perished without resentment, gradually sinking into irredeemable ruin. Therefore, what this chapter records, taking from Yang Zhu, was likely intended to correct the world’s ills.

Qinzi asked Yang Zhu: 'Would you remove a single hair from your body to save the world?' He doubted that Yang Zhu valued the body too much, so he posed this question. Yang Zhu said: 'The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.' He suspected Qinzi did not grasp his meaning, so he answered thus. Qinzi said: 'Suppose it could save it—would you do it?' Yang Zhu did not respond.

Qinzi went out and spoke to Meng Sunyang. Meng Sunyang said: 'You do not understand the Master’s heart. Allow me to explain. If someone could gain ten thousand gold by harming your flesh, would you do it?' He said: 'I would.' Meng Sunyang said: 'If someone could gain a state by severing one of your limbs, would you do it?' Qinzi was silent for a while. Meng Sunyang said: 'A single hair is smaller than flesh, and flesh is smaller than a limb—consider this carefully. Yet hairs accumulate to form flesh, and flesh accumulates to form limbs. A single hair is indeed one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you treat it lightly?' Qinzi said: 'I cannot answer you. But if you asked Lao Dan and Guan Yin, your words would be correct—their teachings value the body and devalue things. If you asked Great Yu and Mo Di, my words would be correct—their teachings forget the self to save others.'

Meng Sunyang then turned and spoke of other matters with his disciples.

*Commentary (Zhenghe):* "The teachings of Laozi and Guan Yin value the body and devalue things. The teachings of Great Yu and Mo Di forget the self to save others. Yet one who regards oneself does not lose others, and one who regards others does not lose oneself. Yang Zhu studied the Way of Laozi and Guan Yin but did not reach it, so he would not pluck a single hair to benefit the world. Mo Di studied the Way of Great Yu but did not reach it, so he wore himself from head to heel to benefit the world. Yet neither grasped the fullness of the Way. Meng Sunyang saw something in Yang Zhu’s Way, and Qin Guli saw something in Mo Di’s Way—thus each affirmed what they affirmed, but neither was comprehensive."

*Commentary (Fan):* "Zihua Zi said to Duke Zhao Xi: 'Suppose the world inscribed a pledge before you: if you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be disabled; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be disabled. Yet whoever seizes it will gain the world—would you seize it?' Duke Zhao Xi said: 'I would not.' For his two arms were weightier than the world. Then how could one harm flesh for ten thousand gold or sever a limb for a state? Yang Zhu’s conduct exceeds self-regard. Those who record such sayings do so only to remedy the ills of the time. If measured by the Way of the sages, they are not without bias.'

Thus, Qinzi said to Meng Sunyang: 'If you asked Lao Dan and Guan Yin, your words would be correct—for their teachings devalue things and value the self. If you asked Great Yu and Mo Di, my words would be correct—for their teachings forget the self to save others.'

Yang Zhu said: 'The world’s praise gathers upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou, and Confucius; the world’s blame gathers upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun plowed at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his four limbs never resting, his mouth and belly never enjoying fine fare. His parents did not love him, his brothers and sisters did not cherish him. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom already in decline. Shang Jun was unworthy, so he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death.'"

These were the bitterest afflictions endured by heaven and man. Gun governed the waters and lands, yet his achievements were never completed, and he was banished to Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his task and avenged his cause, but was consumed by the labor of reclaiming the wilds—his son went unraised, and passing his own door, he did not enter. His body became emaciated, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he dwelt in a humble palace, yet adorned his robes and crowns with splendor, living in sorrow until his death. These were the sorrows and hardships endured by heaven and man.

When King Wu passed, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou assumed the Son of Heaven’s governance. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread slander. Exiled to the east for three years, he executed his brother and banished his kin, barely preserving his own life, living in anxiety until his death. These were the perils and fears endured by heaven and man.

Confucius illuminated the Dao of emperors and kings, responding to the summons of timely rulers. He was driven to fell a tree in Song, to erase his traces in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, and insulted by Yang Hu, living in distress until his death. These were the harried tribulations endured by the people of heaven.

All four of these sages lived without a single day of joy, yet in death, they gained a name for ten thousand generations. But a name is not something real that can be grasped. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they were unaware—no different from a clod of earth or a block of wood. Observing their forms and deeds, the traces of their cares and dangers are manifest. Searching within their hearts, there was none whose mind was not gripped and disturbed.

To clarify the words of the utmost principle, one must present the extremes of beauty and ugliness in opposing pairs.

Jie relied on the resources of generations, occupying the honored southern throne. His wisdom was sufficient to resist all beneath him, his might sufficient to shake the realm. He indulged his ears and eyes in whatever pleased them, exhausted his thoughts and desires in whatever he fancied, living in bliss until his death—this was the wanton dissipation of the people of heaven.

Zhou too relied on the resources of generations, occupying the honored southern throne. His might knew no bounds, his will no opposition. He gave free rein to his passions in the Leaning Palace, indulged his desires through long nights.

They did not torment themselves with rites and righteousness, but lived in bliss until their execution—such were the wanton excesses of the people of heaven.

Those two tyrants enjoyed the pleasures of following every desire in life, yet in death bore the names of folly and brutality. In truth, names have no part in reality: though slandered, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how did they differ from clods of earth or blocks of wood? Having exhausted every extreme of arrogance and luxury, indulged every insatiable nature, though nourished by all within the four seas, they never once found contentment in their hearts. This was but lifelong suffering in disguise.

Those four sages, though the paragons to whom all beauty turned, endured hardship to the end, and all alike met death. Those two tyrants, though the embodiments of all evil, reveled in pleasure to the end, yet likewise met death. In governance and harmony: what sets living things apart is life, what unites them is death—so too with man. Thus, whether sage or fool, wise or wicked, their endowments were surely different, yet in returning to the void, they were not at all distinct. Then what is there to debate between name and reality? What is there to choose between sorrow and joy? This is why those who wander beyond the bounds of the world equalize life and death and forget both their ways.

In Fan Yue’s words: what sets living things apart is life; what unites them is death. Shun’s bitter toil, Yu’s exhausting labors, the Duke of Zhou’s perilous fears, Confucius’s restless haste—those four sages, to whom all the world’s beauty turned, yet lived in sorrow until death, and in death were the same. The wanton dissipation of Jie of Xia, the reckless abandon of Zhou of Shang—those two tyrants, to whom all the world’s evil turned, yet lived in bliss until death, and in death were the same. Thus, the benevolent sage dies, the wicked fool dies—where do we see their difference?

When Yang Zhu met King Hui of Liang, he said that governing the world was as easy as turning one’s palm. The king replied: “You cannot even manage one wife and one concubine, nor tend three acres of garden—how can you claim governing the world is as easy as turning your palm?” Yang Zhu answered: “Have you seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a boy of five feet carrying a switch, will go east when he wishes, west when he wishes. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch behind him, they could not make it move forward. Moreover, I have heard that fish large enough to swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams, and swans soaring high do not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aims are too far-reaching.”

The grand tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frantic dances. Why? Their notes are too sparse. One who would govern the great does not govern the petty; one who would achieve great works does not achieve small ones—this is what is meant. *Zhenghe* states: Governing the household to extend to the state—this speaks of gradual progression in sequence. What applies to the state cannot be applied to the household—this speaks of appropriateness in scale. Thus, herding sheep is a task for a child, while governing the world requires the Dao of Yao and Shun. One who would govern the great does not govern the petty; one who would achieve great works does not achieve small ones. This is the essence of governance, and therein lies the importance of understanding the Dao.

Fan says: A crossbow of a thousand *jun* is not loosed for a mole; a bell of ten thousand *dan* is not struck by a stalk to produce sound. The *kun* fish cannot move its body without the vast sea; the phoenix cannot dry its wings without the towering *wu* tree. One who would govern the great does not govern the petty; one who would achieve great works does not achieve small ones. This is the natural principle.

Yang Zhu says: The affairs of the distant past are extinguished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not; the deeds of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams. The deeds of the Three Kings are sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, yet one in a hundred million is not recognized. Affairs of one’s own time are sometimes heard, sometimes seen, yet one in ten thousand is not recognized. Immediate affairs are sometimes preserved, sometimes discarded, yet one in a thousand is not recognized. From the distant past to the present, the years are truly beyond counting. Yet since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed—whether wise or foolish, fair or foul, success or failure, right or wrong—all vanish, differing only in the swiftness or slowness of their passing. To be deluded by such swiftness or slowness, to strive endlessly in vain—is this not contemptible? To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to exhaust one’s spirit and body in pursuit of a name that may linger a few hundred years after death—can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?

*Zhenghe* states: Time does not linger, and traces fade with it. Those who come after view the present as we view the past. Thus, to pursue fleeting praise or blame and regard life as joyous is to fail to grasp the principle. The distant past is remote, its affairs untransmitted, so they seem extinguished, unrecorded. Since the Three Sovereigns, the past is nearer, so their affairs waver between existence and nonexistence. Since the Five Emperors, the past is nearer still, so their affairs seem real yet resemble dreams. To say they exist as if they exist not is to doubt their presence when in truth they are absent; to say they seem like waking dreams is to doubt their reality when in truth they are unreal. From the Three Kings onward, the past is even nearer, so their deeds are sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed. What has passed is already fading into nothingness, while what remains can attest to its existence—thus their remembrance is uncertain. As for affairs of one’s own time, though recent, what has passed is already heard, what remains is seen, yet both hasten toward stillness. Immediate affairs are unfolding now, yet what the eye fixes upon remains, while what it passes over fades—nothing endures. Thus, in discussing time, there is a difference between near and far; in discussing affairs, there is a disparity in quantity. Yet as the years pass, all become equally unrecognizable. Whether wise or foolish, fair or foul, success or failure, right or wrong—all differ in principle, yet in the end, they vanish alike. To spend one’s life in toil, clashing with things, competing for empty fame in the moment, scheming for posthumous glory—this is not the way to honor life.

Fan says: Affairs in the world arise and perish in an instant, wax and wane in turn, rise and fall in succession, flicker into being and vanish—this is an endless cycle of existence and nonexistence. From the earliest times to the present, countless millions of years have passed. Whether wise or foolish, fair or foul, right or wrong, success or failure—though differing in ten thousand ways, all meet the same end. Yet the deluded do not understand this. They begin by entangling themselves in schemes, exhausting their bodies and startling their hearts, inwardly filling their minds with thorns, outwardly burdening themselves with snares, toiling their whole lives without a moment’s peace. If they do not even permit themselves this, how can life be joyful?

Yang Zhu says: Humans resemble the heavens and earth in kind, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. *Resemble*—to be like; *kind*—to share the same *yin* and *yang*; *nature*—endowed with the Five Phases. They are the most spiritually endowed of living beings. Yet humans’ claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin insufficient for protection, their speed insufficient to escape harm or seek advantage. Lacking fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, they must rely on external things to nourish their nature, employing wisdom rather than strength. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving oneself; what strength disdains is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it; things do not belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot but part with them. The body is the master of life, just as things are the masters of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot possess the body; though one does not part with things, one cannot possess them. To possess things or the body is to wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s body and the world’s things. Only the sage can do this—knowing the body cannot be privately owned, things cannot be possessed. To share the world’s body and the world’s things—only the perfected person can do this. This is what is called the utmost of the utmost. The world’s body is the same as one’s own body; the world’s things are the same as one’s own things—how could this be achieved by anyone but the perfected person? Having realized that selfishness is wrong and knowing that impartiality is right—this is what is called the utmost of the utmost.

*Zhenghe* states: *Resembling the heavens and earth in kind*—referring to their form, round and square, moving and still; *bearing the nature of the Five Constants*—referring to the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. All things share life, yet only humans are the most spiritually endowed of all living beings.

As humans are the most spiritually endowed of all living beings, their intelligence is thus in surplus; yet with claws and teeth unsharp, lacking fur and feathers for protection, their physical strength is thus insufficient. Intelligence in surplus and strength insufficient, they must therefore rely on external things for sustenance—precisely because their intelligence can control the strength of other beings, making them serve their purposes.

Yet if one relies solely on intelligence while also depending on brute force, one fails to discern the relative worth of self and things. What intelligence values is the preservation of the self, for the self is nobler than external things; what brute force degrades is the encroachment upon things, for things can then enslave the self.

The body is not one’s own possession—how could the sage sacrifice things for the body? It is entrusted by the divine luminosity, and thus, once born, one cannot but preserve it. Things are not one’s own possession—how could the sage pursue things at the expense of the body? Knowing they serve only the ears and eyes, once acquired, one cannot but relinquish them.

What is prized in life is this: the body is fundamentally the master of life. Nurturing the form must first rely on external things, and thus things are also the master of sustenance. Nevertheless, what threatens life is the body itself—even if one preserves life, the body cannot be possessed as one’s own. What corrupts the will is external things—even if one does not relinquish them, things cannot be possessed as one’s own.

To claim things as one’s own externally and the body as one’s own internally is to be blinded by partiality and ignorant of the great principle. Secretly hoarding the world’s body and its things as private possessions—how could this be the impartiality of the Dao?

The sage knows the body is the world’s entrusted form and thus can share the world’s body; knowing how things differ from one another, the sage can share the world’s things. Only the utmost sage can achieve this, and thus it is called the utmost of the utmost.

*Fan* states: Your body is not your own—possessing what cannot be possessed is to wrongfully claim the world’s body as private. External things cannot be certain—insisting on what cannot be certain is to wrongfully claim the world’s things as private.

*Laozi* says: *"Know what should be accommodated, and accommodation becomes impartial."* Only impartiality enables all-embracing inclusivity.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"The great person merges all into impartiality."* Only impartiality enables unification.

To share the world’s body is to treat the self as if it were one’s own, yet the self fundamentally has no self. To share the world’s things is to treat things as if they were one’s own, yet things fundamentally have no things.

Those who advance in this Dao—how could there remain any trace of self-serving knowledge in their hearts? How could they make self-interest their concern? Only the perfected person, free from self, can achieve this. The sage, however, has not yet transcended the human way and thus still falls short in this regard.

Is this not what *Zhuangzi* meant by *"that which has never yet begun to be a thing"*—that which cannot be surpassed?

*Yang Zhu* said: *"The people’s inability to rest arises from four causes: first, for longevity—daring not indulge their desires; second, for reputation—"*

second, for reputation—daring not indulge their conduct; third, for rank—bending their will to seek advancement; fourth, for wealth—hoarding gains and begrudging expenditures. Those bound by these four live in fear: fear of spirits, fear of others, fear of authority, fear of punishment. Such are called the "fugitive people," for they violate their own nature. Their lives hang by a thread, controlled by forces beyond themselves. Only when nothing is tied to the self—when one does not defy fate—why covet longevity? When one does not prize nobility, why covet reputation? When one does not crave power, why covet rank? When one does not lust for riches, why covet wealth? These are called the "obedient people." They follow the principle of life, and nothing in the world can oppose them, for they hold command within. External things cannot control them.

*Zhenghe* states: Those who labor for life seek longevity; those who seek acclaim chase reputation; those who exalt titles pursue rank; those who chase profit covet wealth. With inner restlessness comes outer dread—thus in darkness they fear the reproach of spirits, in daylight they fear the censure of men. Where power is applied, where punishment reaches, there is no end to their fear. Their lives are spent in toil, never a moment’s rest. Is this not why they cannot find respite?

To know one’s allotted portion and refrain from envy is to dwell in stillness and rest. Where could one go and not find leisure? Those called "fugitive people" act against their natural principles; those called "obedient people" follow what is inherently so. Those who violate their nature submit to fate without understanding, so their lives may be taken or spared, and command lies beyond them. Those who follow what is inherently so command all things without submission, so nothing in the world can oppose them, and command lies within.

*Fan* said: Those who seek longevity live in a daze, endlessly anxious about death—what suffering is this? Their form is already far removed from the Way, so they take life as a burden, even fearing the reproach of spirits. Day and night they ponder right and wrong, their form already estranged from the Way, so they take fame as truth, even fearing the judgment of men. If power is not great, yet the boastful grieve over it, then rank is all they have—how can they not fear authority? If wealth is not amassed, yet the greedy fret over it, then wealth is all they have—how can they not fear punishment? Acting thus, they flee from heaven and betray their nature, forgetting what they have received. Life and death are named, but control lies not with them—how can they find their own contentment?

Only those who embody the Dao rest in the fixed portion of nature, follow the unchanging truth, welcome what comes with equanimity, and accept what goes with compliance. Never do they look outward with envy or desire. Thus, they stand apart yet equal to heaven, leave things behind yet abide in solitude, and turn the myriad transformations as they will. This is what the ancients meant by "commanding all things without submission." As the saying goes:

If one neither marries nor enters officialdom, half of human desires are lost; if one neither wears fine clothes nor eats rich food, the Way of ruler and subject ceases. As the Zhou proverb says: "A field laborer can be killed by sitting still." Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; sipping bean broth and chewing coarse greens, he deems this the height of flavor. His flesh is rough and thick, his sinews and joints taut—should he suddenly be clad in soft furs and fine silks, offered fine grains and meats, fragrant orchids and citrus, his heart would grow restless, his body vexed, and inner heat would breed illness. Thus exhausted, he would be undone. Whatever one is accustomed to cannot be abruptly changed—how much more so for the eyes and the heart?

Thus, what the rustic finds at peace, the rustic finds beautiful, and he deems nothing in the world surpasses it. Once in Song there was a field laborer who wore only tattered hemp to endure the winter. When spring came and he began his eastern toil, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s grand halls and secluded chambers, its silk floss and fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: "The warmth of the sun at my back—none know of this. If I offered it to our lord, he would surely reward me richly." A wealthy man of his village told him: "Long ago, there was one who praised the fine flavor of wild beans, the sweetness of water celery and duckweed seeds to the village magnate—the village’s most honored man. The magnate took and tasted them, only to be stung in the mouth and stricken in the belly. The crowd mocked and reviled him, and the man was deeply shamed. You are of this kind."

When the world is at peace with the dispositions of life and nature, then these four—marriage, office, fine clothes, rich food—may exist or vanish as they will. When the world is not at peace with the dispositions of life and nature, then the foolish and the wise mock one another, and envy arises. The duty between ruler and subject, the rites between husband and wife—these are fate, yet rooted in nature; the noble person does not call them fate. The mouth’s delight in flavor, the limbs’ ease in comfort—these are nature, yet subject to fate; the noble person does not call them nature.

Yangzi cited the words on marriage and office, ruler and subject, and invoked the tale of the field laborer and the village magnate—all to show that when the world is not at peace with the dispositions of life and nature, it comes to this. Yang Zhu said: "Grand houses, fine robes, rich flavors, fair faces—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who have them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Such insatiable nature is a canker in the balance of yin and yang. It not only burdens the self but also erodes the upright qi."

When movement transgresses, punishment takes hold. Those who suffer inner punishment are consumed by yin and yang. If insatiable nature is a canker in yin and yang, is it not then the fault of inner punishment?

Fan said: The roc of the southern sea cannot spread its wings in the brambles, while the sparrow’s freedom has space to spare. The turtle of the eastern sea cannot stretch its feet in a roadside ditch, yet the frog leaps and bounds with water to spare. The fixed portion of nature cannot be altered. Thus, one must not harbor ambitions beyond one’s lot. Should one stray beyond the bounds of one’s allotted span and reach extravagance, then desires swell, likes and dislikes grow, and the dispositions of life and nature sicken. The raiders of yin and yang—how can one escape them?

The arguments of this chapter lean toward excess and indulgence, for they aim to remedy prevailing ills. Yet if one fails to grasp the intent to rescue from ruin and takes this as the norm, then the world’s noble persons will endanger their lives and abandon their nature in pursuit of things—how can they find peace in their fixed portion? Thus, the tale of the field laborer follows.

Loyalty is insufficient to secure the ruler’s peace and only endangers the self; duty is insufficient to benefit others and only harms one’s life. The ruler’s peace does not arise from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty perishes; benefiting others does not arise from duty, and so the name of duty vanishes. When ruler and subject are both at peace, when self and others both profit—this was the Way of the ancients.

Loyalty is meant to secure the ruler’s peace, but if loyalty is used lightly at the cost of one’s life, it cannot secure the ruler’s peace and only endangers the self. Duty is meant to benefit others, but if duty brings distress to oneself, it cannot benefit others and only harms one’s life. Thus, loyalty that secures the ruler’s peace desires that ruler and subject both be at peace; duty that benefits others desires that self and others both profit. This was the Way of the ancients.

Master Yu said: "Abandon fame, and you will have no worries." Laozi said: "Fame is the guest of reality." Yet the careless pursue fame without end. Fame cannot be abandoned—can it not be treated as a guest? Now, with fame comes honor and glory; without fame comes lowliness and disgrace. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; lowliness and disgrace bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are bound to reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can it be treated as a guest? One need only despise those who cling to fame and thus burden reality. Clinging to fame and burdening reality, one will fret over the threat of ruin—how could it be merely a matter of ease and joy, sorrow and suffering?

From within, abandoning fame brings freedom from worry; from without, having fame brings honor and glory. Yet the sage lets things be as they are—why should he trouble his heart? To relinquish merit and fame, returning them to the multitude, is not the way to seek freedom from worry. If one possesses reality, yet when others grant fame, one refuses it—this is not the way to pursue honor and glory. Unbound by either, this is called the Way of following the dispositions of life and nature.

Fan said: Fame cannot be schemed for, for that is contention; it cannot be boasted of, for that is vanity; it cannot be wielded with power, for that is coercion. Thus, the ancients called it a public vessel, not to be taken in excess. Those who die for fame, those who prize fame, those who steal fame—how could they know that the perfected person sees it as shackles and speaks of being free from the burden of fame?

This chapter began with the discourse on fame and necessarily concludes with it, thereby shedding the encumbrance of its words. *The Fourfold Exegesis of the True Scripture of Perfect Virtue and Utmost Emptiness, Scroll Eighteen* ends here.

**On Correspondences**
Zhang said: Affairs have no fixed direction; fortune and misfortune propel one another. When words are verified by events, they are grasped at the convergence of transformation and adaptation.

Lu said: This chapter strips away the superficial to reveal the fundamental, distinguishing form from spirit to establish matters and manifest the real. By seeking reality through names, one then perceives how following emotions leads one astray from the Dao, and how pursuing desires results in the loss of authenticity. Thus, those who know the Dao do not lose their proper timing, and those who employ their abilities need not flee from harm.

*Zhenghe*: One who speaks well of Heaven must have verification in man. *Heaven’s Auspices* demonstrates the verification of spontaneity; *On Correspondences* aligns human affairs with it. This is the meaning of the book’s chapter titles from beginning to end.

Fan said: The changes of events and things are myriad and disparate. Success and failure follow one another; fortune and misfortune alternate like the succession of generations. When words are verified, how could it be mere coincidence? They accord with the natural correspondences, and that is all. Confucius said: “I wish to be without words.” To be without words is the original mind of the sage. Yet, compelled by necessity, he speaks—his purpose being to clarify the Dao. If all under Heaven attained the Dao, what need would there be for words? Thus, the *Laozi* concludes with “trustworthy words are not beautiful,” summarizing the intent behind its composition. The *Liezi* concludes with *On Correspondences*, thereby erasing the traces of its own authorship.

Master Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin. Master Huqiu Zilin said: “If you understand how to hold back, then we may speak of how to preserve the self.” The *Laozi* says: “Hold back the self, and the self will advance.” Liezi said: “I wish to hear about holding back.” The master replied: “Observe your shadow, and you will understand.” Liezi turned and examined his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness followed the form and did not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depended on the object and not on the self. This is what is meant by “holding back to be first.” No thing can contend with it, and so it is always first. These words seem to be Huzi’s answer, though not explicitly stated. Liezi grasped the meaning of holding back and thus explained it himself. Huzi, taking this as clarification, did not respond further.

Lu said: The shadow arises from the form, and its crookedness or straightness lies in the form. The living form arises from the spirit, and its authenticity or falsity lies in the spirit’s function. If one sees the shadow and discerns the form, or knows the form and illuminates the spirit—without demanding that the shadow rectify the body, or clinging to the body to clarify the Dao—then by observing the branch, one knows the root; by examining the manifest, one perceives the subtle. Only then can one always be first.

*Zhenghe*: The Dao takes softness, weakness, and humility as its outward expression. Thus, it responds to stimuli without ever preceding others. Like a well-sweep, it rises and falls with others. Not contending with things, yet nothing under Heaven can contend with it—this is how “holding back the self, the self advances,” as the principle resides herein. Thus it is said: “Bending and extending depend on the object and not on the self.” This is what is meant by “holding back to be first.”

Fan said: The shadow, as a thing, is present with fire and sunlight, and absent with darkness and night. It seems to depend on conditions, yet in truth depends on nothing. When it goes, I go with it; when it comes, I come with it. When it grows bright, I grow bright with it. Whether crooked or straight, it merely follows the form. Thus, Liezi observed it and grasped the principle of holding back. While others all seek to be first, he alone sought to be last. Daily bearing the world’s filth—this is what is called “holding back.” Not contending with things, yet nothing under Heaven can contend with it, and so it is always first. The *Laozi* says: “The sage holds back the self, and the self advances.” It also says: “Desiring to be first among men, place the self behind them.” The meaning here accords with that.

Guan Yin said to Master Liezi: “Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; ugly words produce an ugly echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. A name is like an echo; the self is like a shadow. The retribution of good and evil is like an echo or shadow—there is no discrepancy in principle. Thus it is said: ‘Be cautious in your words, for they will be known; be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed.’ This is what is meant by ‘Utter good words, and a thousand *li* away they will respond; act near at hand, and it will be seen afar.’ Therefore, the sage perceives the outward to know the inward, observes the past to know the future—this is the principle by which he knows beforehand. Seeing words go forth, the echo returns; seeing the form depart, the shadow arrives. The principle of retribution is no different from this. Yet beings do not comprehend it, and so it is called ‘knowing beforehand.’”

Lu said: The echo follows the sound; if the sound is good, the echo is beautiful. The name follows the reality; if the reality is good, the name is true. Thus, the name is the echo of the voice, and the self is the shadow of the spirit. The voice goes forth and the echo responds; conduct is practiced and the spirit follows. Therefore, the sage hears the echo and knows the sound, sees the conduct and knows the Dao.

*Zhenghe*: Words are uttered and the echo responds; the form moves and the shadow follows. Beauty and ugliness, length and shortness reside here and not there. Thus, when the noble person is about to speak or act, he must be cautious in solitude. The *Book of Changes* says: “To foreknow the incipient is to be divine, is it not?” Perceiving the outward to know the inward, observing the past to know the future, acting before things arise—is this not being divine in foreknowledge?

Fan said: Words and deeds in interaction with things are like sound to echo, form to shadow. If the sound is beautiful or ugly, the echo responds accordingly; if the form is long or short, the shadow follows suit. Thus, words issue from the self and are applied to the people; conduct arises near at hand and is seen afar. Words and deeds are how the noble person moves Heaven and Earth—how could he not be cautious? He must examine the incipient. The sage is lucid at dawn in perceiving the solitary, radiant in the subtlest and most profound. Perceiving the outward to know the inward, observing the past to know the future.

The greatness of words and deeds begins with deliberation and ends in transformation and change. Thus, words should be free from flaws that could bring blame, and deeds should leave no traces that can be followed. The measure lies within oneself, while verification rests with others. If others love me, I must love them in return; if others hate me, I must hate them in return. The rites and measures reside in oneself, but their testing and proof lie with others. Love and hatred follow accordingly, and things will not betray oneself.

Tang and Wu loved all under Heaven, thus they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under Heaven, thus they perished—this is the verification and proof of what is tested. Lu said: The rites and measures lie within oneself, while testing and verification lie with others, like a shadow responding to form or an echo answering sound. The traces of Tang, Wu, Jie, and Zhou can be tested, their measures can be discerned, and the heart of love and hatred cannot but be cautious.

If the principles of testing and measuring are clear yet the Dao is not followed, it is like going out without using the door or walking without following the path. When the principles of testing and measuring are understood yet the Dao is still not practiced, then one may leave without passing through the gate or walk without taking the path. Seeking profit in this way—is it not difficult? To gain profit by violating principle—this has never been.

Lu said: If the matters of testing and measuring are clear yet the Dao is not followed, it is like walking without using doors, gates, or thoroughfares. To seek profit for oneself in the world in this way—is it not difficult? I have observed the virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor, examined the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and weighed the words of learned scholars and worthies. In all cases of survival or ruin, decline or rise, none have departed from this Dao. From ancient times to the present, none have failed to accord with this verification.

Lu said: Examine their conduct, test their traces, and the words of emperors, kings, and sagely ministers throughout the ages—whether in survival or ruin, rise or decline—are as clear as firewood. Those who govern without following this Dao have never existed.

*Governing in Harmony* states: "Measuring" speaks of what can be measured, "testing" speaks of what can be examined. To know what can be measured in oneself, one must consider what others test—thus it is attained. Therefore, others’ love or hatred toward me arises from my own love or hatred. The rise of emperors and the flourishing of kings—many officials and scholars can clarify this. In testing the Dao of rise and decline, none have departed from this.

Fan said: To take oneself as the measure—its root lies here; to take testing as the decision—its effect lies there. If one loves others, others will love me; if one hates others, others will hate me. The sentiments of love and hatred never fail to originate from oneself. Tang and Wu accumulated virtue and possessed all within the seas; their love was evident, thus their rise was swift. Jie and Zhou were unbenevolent and lost the world; their hatred was evident, thus their fall was sudden. Is this not the verification of what is tested in others and the proof of this Dao? From ancient times to the present, none have departed from this.

Yan Hui said: Those who inquire about the Dao do so for the sake of wealth. To inquire is like to learn. Now that you have obtained a pearl, you are wealthy—why still seek the Dao? The Dao is the root of wealth; the pearl is but its branch. When the root exists, the branch endures; if one clings only to the branch, the root is lost.

Master Liezi said: Jie and Zhou prized profit and slighted the Dao, hence their downfall. They were not without wealth, yet losing the root brought ruin to themselves. How fortunate I am not to have spoken to you earlier! A man without righteousness is but a feeder—righteousness is propriety. To attain the proper principle is to hold what no thing can wrest away. Such a one is no better than a chicken or dog. To vie for food with brute force, where the stronger prevails, is the way of beasts. To seek victory through strength is not the human Dao. To become like chickens, dogs, or beasts yet desire others’ respect is impossible. How could one expect others to honor them? When the Dao is present, self-respect naturally follows. If others do not honor you, peril and disgrace will befall you. To be joyfully esteemed without weariness—this is what it means to be honored. Should one violate this principle, ruin will come.

Lu said: To be free from want is called wealth, not the wealth of seeking profit. To prize profit and slight the Dao was the downfall of Jie and Zhou. Chickens, dogs, and beasts know not benevolence or righteousness; they contend for food by force, heedless of all else. Acting thus invites peril and disgrace, and how can one then expect others’ respect? This is what it means to seek substance through name.

*Zhenghe* states: The Classic says: Though one possesses a large jade disc preceded by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao. If one slights the Dao to pursue things, others will not honor them, and peril and disgrace will follow.

Fan said: Balance is fortune; excess is misfortune—no thing is exempt, and wealth is the most extreme case. The rich toil their bodies and labor diligently, amassing wealth they cannot fully use. Their form becomes externalized—how could they know the Dao-followers who speak of contentment? Within the realm of free wandering, moving without name, though ten thousand differences exist, all needs are met, and the wealth of nations is encompassed. Thus, none confer rank upon them, yet they remain naturally esteemed; the world delights in honoring them without weariness. They have never prized profit and slighted the Dao, nor regarded wealth as right.

Liezi learned archery and hit the mark. He hit it effortlessly, not by deliberate aiming. He consulted Master Guan Yin. The master asked: Do you know why you hit the mark? He replied: I do not. Master Guan Yin said: It is not yet time. Though you hit the mark, you do not know why—thus, it is not yet time. He withdrew and practiced. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin. The master asked again: Do you know why you hit the mark? Liezi said: I know now. Master Guan Yin said: It is time. Hold to this and do not lose it. With a calm mind and upright body, seeking within oneself, one attains the Dao of hitting the mark. Then, one can aim beforehand and shoot without fail. This is not only true of archery but also of governing a state and cultivating oneself.

Thus, the sage does not examine existence or extinction but examines their causes. Though one hits the mark in archery, not knowing why means it is not the true Dao of hitting. Though one’s body endures, not knowing why means it is not the true principle of endurance. Therefore, in archery, both the clumsy and the skilled may hit the mark, but their understanding of why differs. Both the worthy and the foolish may endure, but their understanding of why diverges.

Lu said: One who does not know why they hit the mark is not the most excellent. To grasp it with the hand and respond with the heart, to hit the mark as intended—this is attainment. To attain and hold it is called the Dao. To know this Dao is not only for archery but also for governing a state and cultivating oneself. The excellent archer does not value merely hitting the mark but values the reason for certain success. Likewise, one who excels in governing a state or cultivating oneself does not value mere endurance but values the reason for certain endurance. Thus, the worthy and foolish, order and chaos, can be understood through this Dao.

*Zhenghe* states: Can an archer who hits the mark without prior aim be called a good shot? Only by aiming beforehand can one control the outcome, ensuring no duality and acting as one wills. Extending this to self-cultivation and state governance follows the same principle. The sage does not examine existence but examines its cause, does not examine extinction but examines its cause. Existence and extinction are branches; their causes are the root. Examining the cause of existence reveals how to avoid extinction; examining the cause of extinction reveals how to preserve existence.

Fan said: The archers of old aligned their inner will, straightened their outer form, steadied themselves, then released the arrow, never missing the target—this is what it means to aim beforehand and hit. If one reflects within yet does not know the Dao of hitting the mark, how can arrow after arrow follow and shot after shot strike true? Yet this is not only true of archery but also of governing a state and cultivating oneself. Only the sage, deeply attuned to the subtle workings, clearly perceiving the formless, does not examine existence or extinction but examines their causes. Thus, in nurturing life, they are abundant in flexibility; in conducting themselves, they are fitting in ebb and flow; in managing affairs, they know the strategies of success and failure; in confronting enemies, they grasp the power of capture and release. Responding to myriad changes, they are flawless everywhere—no different from aiming beforehand and hitting the mark.

Liezi said: Those abundant in beauty are arrogant; those abundant in strength are aggressive—they cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Beauty and strength are what ordinary people pursue. Thus, even those with graying hair who speak of the Dao err, let alone practice it. Only when beauty and strength wane do they seek to speak of the Dao, but their awakening comes too late. Even speaking of it is beyond their grasp, let alone practicing it. Thus, those who act aggressively find none to instruct them. With none to instruct them, they are isolated and without aid. The arrogant and aggressive, though instructed, do not accept it—they harbor envious hearts, their ears and eyes are self-blocked, and who would assist them?

The worthy entrust others, thus even in old age they do not decline, and when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos. If they do not rely solely on their own wisdom, all things willingly serve them. Therefore, the difficulty in governing a state lies in recognizing the worthy, not in considering oneself worthy. Those who consider themselves worthy are precisely the "isolated and without aid" mentioned above. Recognizing the worthy allows the wise to plan for them, the capable to serve them, and no talent is wasted—thus the state is easily governed.

Lu said: What the common people rely on are beauty and strength. Relying on beauty breeds arrogance and indolence; relying on strength fosters aggression and violence—they cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Those whose beauty and strength have faded are the gray-haired. Even hearing the Dao in old age, they cannot practice it, let alone put it into action. Thus, those who cling to weakness are surely embraced by the Dao, while those who boast of their strength find none willing to instruct them. With none willing to instruct them, how could they have any aid? The worthy entrust others, thus even in their final years their spirit does not wane, and when their wisdom is exhausted, their minds do not fall into chaos. Those who govern by this principle, recognizing the worthy and entrusting them, find worthy talents at their service. Those who consider themselves worthy and lack aid lose the people.

*Zhenghe* states: The Dao takes plain simplicity as its essence and meekness, humility, and deference as its outward form. Thus, those who flaunt their beauty to dominate others yet do not discard their beauty, or those who exalt their strength yet cannot but rely on it, are both unfit to discuss the great methods of the Dao. As the saying goes: "Practice worthiness and abandon the conduct of self-worth—where could one go and not be loved?" Thus, those who do not boast of themselves find others gladly teaching them the good Dao. Therein, those who hear the Dao may be advanced in years yet retain the countenance of a child—this is what is meant by "even in old age they do not decline." Therein, those who understand the Dao may grasp principles yet not let things harm them—this is what is meant by "when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos." This is why the way to govern a state lies in embodying it oneself, humbling oneself before others, and only then casting aside arrogance and self-importance.

Fan said: Only by not boasting can one avoid flaunting beauty to dominate others; only by not being self-important can one avoid using strength to overpower others. Those who embody the Dao cannot advance further. Moreover, in the principles of the world, relying on oneself leads to pettiness, while seeking counsel leads to abundance. Those who govern well humble themselves before the worthy, never lording their worth over others. Thus, the perceptive exhaust their sight and hearing, the wise and capable devote their schemes and efforts. If one can practice worthiness while abandoning the conduct of self-worth, how could there be any state left ungoverned?

A man of Song crafted a mulberry leaf from jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its veins, stems, and branches, its finest details and lustrous sheen, were indistinguishable from real mulberry leaves when mixed among them. This man then lived off his craft in Song. When Master Liezi heard of this, he said: If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, there would be few things with leaves. Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao, not on cleverness and skill. This illustrates that relying on skill and ability is insufficient to provide for all things, but following the Dao in transformation, nothing is left unfulfilled.

Lu said: Carving and polishing to return to simplicity is the way of restoring purity. Thus it is said: The skilled binder needs no glue or lacquer; the skilled locker needs no bolts or keys. Therefore, great eloquence seems inarticulate, and great skill seems clumsy. If it takes three years to craft a single leaf indistinguishable from a real one, is this the skill of one who governs a state and preserves the Dao? Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao, like the harmonious qi spreading to generate the myriad things, not on cleverness and skill. If one violates heavenly principles and produces false craft, this is failing to understand the root and branches.

*Zhenghe* states: The Dao carves and shapes the myriad forms yet is not deemed clever. Secretly relying on one’s own wisdom and strength to do so, how could one provide for every single thing? Thus, without carving or polishing, it measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion—this is why the sage entrusts the transformative power of the Dao and not cleverness and skill.

Fan said: Great systems are not divided. The carving and shaping of the myriad forms—those that fill the space between heaven and earth, with trunks and fruits, branches and vines—take shape without compass or square, their forms cut and tailored by themselves; they take on color without cinnabar or indigo, their adornments applied by themselves. Though there are ten thousand differences, not one is lacking. How could it be that heaven is assisted by man and thus bears the labor of carving mulberry leaves? The sage is simply heaven and earth, thus taking the Dao as transformation, acting without action so the world aids him—who would toil over cleverness and skill?

Master Liezi was poor, his appearance bearing the look of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang of Zheng, saying: Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao, yet he lives in your state in poverty—could it be that you do not favor scholars? Ziyang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Master Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed.

When Master Liezi returned home, his wife gazed at him and, striking her breast, said: "I have heard that the wives and children of those who possess the Dao all enjoy ease and joy. Yet you bear the look of hunger, and the lord, having learned of it, sent you food. You refused to accept—could this not be fate?" Master Liezi smiled and said to her: "The lord did not know me of his own accord. It was on another’s word that he sent me grain, and when he punishes me, it will likewise be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept." In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.

Lu said: "To eat another’s grain is to share his concerns. The lord did not know me; he bestowed his gift on the word of another. If he were to punish me, it would also be on the word of another. What I value is the true understanding of one who knows me—a man who has awakened to the Dao. When Ziyang’s rebellion arose and I was not harmed, this was truly what is called ‘not being injured or burdened by external things.’"

*Zhenghe* states: "Those who honor life do not harm their bodies with sustenance." In this, Master Liezi had the principle of foreknowledge.

Fan said: "The exemplary scholars of old would not exchange their integrity even for the rank of the Three Ducal Ministers, nor abandon their resolve even for the emoluments of ten thousand *zhong*. If something could be refused yet was given, they never accepted it with delight. The passage states that the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang, further illustrating how the sage’s awareness of the subtle is like this."

The Lu family of the Shi clan had two sons. One loved learning, the other military arts. The one fond of learning offered his skills to the Marquis of Qi, who received him and made him tutor to the noble scions. The one fond of arms went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and appointed him military commandant. Their salaries enriched the household, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.

The Meng family, neighbors of the Shi clan, also had two sons with the same pursuits, yet they were impoverished. Envying the Shi family’s prosperity, they inquired about the means to advancement. The two sons truthfully told the Mengs. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his skills to the King of Qin. The King of Qin said: "Now the feudal lords contend with force, and their sole concern is arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin." He then castrated the man and banished him. The other son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The Marquis of Wei said: "My state is weak and hemmed in by great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military authority, destruction would be imminent. If I were to let you return intact and you went to another state, the harm to me would be no small matter." He then had the man’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.

Upon their return, the Meng father and sons beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi patriarch said: "Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your success differed—you missed the moment, not that your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What accords with the moment is right; what misses the meeting is wrong. What was once used may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. In this use and disuse, there is no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and meeting the times, responding to affairs without fixed method—this belongs to wisdom. Even with the arts of the Seven Virtues and ritual propriety, if wisdom does not suit the time, then action will miss the meeting. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not be in dire straits? The reason your two sons fell into hardship was not due to their learning or skill, but because they did not follow what was timely."

The Meng father and sons relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: "We understand. Say no more."

Lu said: "To study the Way of benevolence and righteousness, to master the arts of strategy—though civil and martial differ, both return to the use of talent and conduct, which must rely on wisdom’s timely application. Wisdom is the function of the Dao; to employ wisdom alone is not the Dao. To strike is to hit the gap; to meet is to suit the time. Responding to change without fixed method—all this is wisdom. Thus, those who suit the time are never at a loss for talent; those who understand the Dao are never lacking in wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as martial as Lü Shang, one would not escape hardship. The Mengs having awakened, they said, ‘Say no more.’"

*Zhenghe* states: "Principles have no constant right—the timely is right. Affairs have no constant wrong—what does not suit the time is wrong. When one’s mandate accords with the time and one is greatly in harmony with the world, what was discarded may be used; when one’s mandate does not accord with the time and one is greatly in dire straits, what was used may be discarded. The noble man knows that hardship has its mandate and that success has its time. Thus, he rests in the time and follows the mandate—how could he rely on petty cunning to seize opportunities and meet affairs?"

Fan said: "Things have no constant suitability; suitability lies in following the time. What is right and what is wrong are not yet fixed. The Mengs’ two sons shared the same path as the Shi sons yet differed in success—was their conduct flawed? This is what is called ‘not encountering the time.’"

Duke Wen of Jin went out to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. Viscount Chu looked up to the sky and laughed. The Duke asked why he laughed. He replied: "I laugh at my neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home. On the road, he saw a woman picking mulberries and, pleased, spoke with her. Yet when he turned to look at his wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I secretly laughed at this." The Duke grasped his meaning and called off the attack.

Returning with his troops, before they had even arrived, there came those who would raid his northern borders. What I have done, others will also do. Yet one seeks to indulge one’s own ambitions, believing things will not give rise to intentions—this is confusion over the feelings of self and other.

Lu said: "To value attainment yet not know that attainment requires something to uphold—this is the common disposition of the vulgar. Thus desires are endless, and the true Dao daily diminishes. What is precious about knowing the Dao is that one inwardly upholds the Dao without loss, outwardly employing things without omission. The people of the world, however, are not so: outwardly they covet sensual pleasures, delighting in other men’s wives, while inwardly they lose the Dao—thus their own wives are beckoned away."

Zhenghe said: "Observing the full and the empty, knowing that division has no constancy—how then could one alone elevate oneself over others in departure or approach? This is why the sage perceives the cicada and magpie entangled yet does not allow things to harm the self."

Fan said: "Those who accompany things are in turn accompanied by things; those who harm others are repaid in kind. Things inherently entangle one another—these two kinds summon each other. This is why the forester of the chestnut grove took me for a target of vengeance, and why the true person of old did not appear at court for three months."

The tradition records that when the King of Wu wished to attack Jing, a youth remonstrated with him—his principle accords with this. The state of Jin suffered from bandits.

There was a man named Xie Yong who could discern thieves by gazing into their eyes, scrutinizing the space between their brows and lashes to uncover their true nature. The Lord of Jin employed him to identify thieves, and among thousands, not one escaped his detection. The Lord of Jin rejoiced greatly and told Zhao Wenzi: "I have found a man who can eradicate all thieves in the state—what need is there for more?" Wenzi replied: "If my lord relies on surveillance to catch thieves, thieves will never be eradicated. Moreover, Xie Yong will surely not meet a natural death." Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: "The one who has cornered us is Xie Yong." They then joined forces to assault and kill him. The Lord of Jin, hearing this, was greatly alarmed. He immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: "Just as you predicted, Xie Yong is dead. But what course should we take now?" Wenzi said: "There is a Zhou proverb: 'He who sees the fish in the abyss brings misfortune; he who predicts hidden things invites calamity.' This is why he met his end. If you wish to eliminate thieves, nothing is better than elevating the worthy and entrusting them with office. Let instruction be clear from above, and transformation will flow below. When the people possess a sense of shame, what need is there for thieves?" This is the way to stop thievery. Thereupon, Sui Hui was appointed to govern, and the bandits fled to Qin.

Those who employ cleverness to discern right and wrong provide an escape for the deceitful; those who rely on foresight to expose hidden evils incur the hatred of the wicked. Is the peril of cunning merely empty words?

Lu said: "Instruction is the trace. It is what the multitude follow and practice. Transformation is the Dao. It is what the multitude employ daily and submit to in their hearts. When hearts submit, shame arises; when traces are clear, instruction is accomplished. Elevate the worthy and employ the capable, and thieves will flee."

Someone asked: "Zhuangzi said, 'When the sage is born, great thieves arise.' Yet here it is said that elevating the worthy and employing the capable causes bandits to depart. What does this mean?" The reply: "Those who seek empty fame while losing substance give rise to great thieves; those who attain substance while forsaking fame cause bandits to depart. Thus, elevating the worthy and employing the capable is the pursuit of fame; appointing Sui Hui is the attainment of substance. The principles do not contradict—what doubt can there be?"

Zhenghe said: "Guide them with virtue, and they will possess shame and be corrected." The sage teaches the people and transforms them through the Dao, so that even if rewarded, they would not steal. To regard severity as wisdom is to grasp at the branch and neglect the root. Excessive scrutiny inevitably provokes unfilial hearts in response. Xie Yong’s scrutiny of thieves is why he was killed. Elevate the worthy, and the unbenevolent will distance themselves. Sui Hui’s governance is why the bandits fled to other lands.

Fan said: "When water serves as a mirror, it reflects forms without employing cunning, so that the square, round, crooked, and straight cannot escape. The skillful ruler conceals his sharp instruments, does not display them to others, governs through non-action so the people naturally transform, and remains desireless so the people naturally become simple. Why would he ever rely on schemes, multiply laws, embellish intelligence to astonish the foolish, or depend on keen observation to expect the capture of thieves? Xie Yong did not understand this."

Confucius, returning from Wei to Lu, halted his carriage by the bridge over the Yellow River to observe. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its circular current flowing ninety *li*, where fish and soft-shelled turtles could not swim, and alligators could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: "This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its current flows ninety *li*, where fish and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim, and alligators cannot dwell. Surely it is difficult to cross?" The man, without hesitation, proceeded to wade across and emerged. Confucius asked him: "Is this skill? Or do you possess a method? How were you able to enter and exit?" The man replied: "When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust; when I exited, I followed with loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act selfishly. This is how I was able to enter and exit." Confucius said to his disciples: "Remember this, my disciples. If even water can be traversed by entrusting oneself to loyalty and trust, how much more so with people?" This passage also appears in the *Huangdi* chapter, though with slight differences, but the meaning is not distinct, so its interpretation is not repeated here.

Lu said: "Loyalty is harmony with things; trust is absence of doubt. Harmonious and without doubt, not selfish toward oneself—this is how one enters and exits. Thus, to be harmonious and without doubt, not selfish toward oneself, is to know the Dao." This passage already appears in the *Huangdi* chapter.

Zhenghe said: "The Dao of utmost sincerity is unobstructed in all things. Loyal and without deceit, trustworthy and without doubt—acting with a sincere heart can move things. It can stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance. Thus, one may traverse metal and stone, tread through water and fire."

Fan said: "He who swims at Lüliang must follow the principles of life and destiny; he who crosses the river bridge must embody the Dao of loyalty and trust. Their essence is one."

Bai Gong asked Confucius: "Can one speak with you in subtle words?" Confucius did not respond. Bai Gong was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. His father Jian, slandered by Fei Wuji, fled to Zheng, where the people of Zheng killed him. Sheng wished to have Prime Minister Zixi and Marshal Ziqu attack Zheng, but though they agreed, they had not yet acted. When Jin attacked Zheng, Zixi and Ziqu prepared to rescue Zheng. Sheng grew angry and said: "The people of Zheng are here—our enemies are not far!" He intended to kill Zixi and Ziqu, hence his question to Confucius. Confucius, knowing this, did not respond.

Lu said: "Subtle words are secret words, which others cannot know. Bai Gong was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. Jian fled to Zheng, and Bai Gong sought to cause chaos, which is why Confucius did not respond."

Bai Gong asked: "If one casts a stone into water, what then?"
Confucius replied: "A skilled diver of Wu could retrieve it."
The stone sinks when cast into water—this illustrates how subtle words escape notice, and so Confucius answered that only a skilled diver could recover it, making clear that nothing can remain hidden.

Bai Gong asked: "If one pours water into water, what then?"
Confucius replied: "When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers mingle, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them."
Again, even a master of flavors could discern them.

Lu said: "Casting a stone into water is like traces that cannot be seen; pouring water into water is like blending that cannot be concealed. Flavors may be distinct, yet the waters of the Zi and Meng cannot truly merge. Only through spiritual resonance with principle can one grasp such things."

Bai Gong asked: "Is it then impossible to speak in subtle words with others?"
Confucius replied: "Why should it be impossible? Only those who do not understand the meaning of words would think so."
The meaning of words is what conveys their intent; when the intent of speech is revealed, then the subtleties of language are manifest. When embodied in action, nothing remains hidden. Those who understand the meaning of words do not rely on words themselves—for when words are used to speak, subtlety and concealment vanish.

Lu said: "When emotions arise, events become evident; when flavors differ, they can be tasted. Only the boundless spirit, the one who understands the meaning of words, achieves spiritual communion. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—not because they delight in it, but because the situation compels them. Thus, the highest words transcend words, and principle becomes self-evident; transformation proceeds of itself. The highest action is non-action, principle fulfills itself, and things follow naturally. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial. When the root remains while the branches are pursued, clarity comes only after affairs are exposed—and few escape unscathed."

Lu said: "Fish dwell in water, and those who contend for them get wet; beasts flee across the wilds, and those who pursue them must run—not by choice, but by the force of circumstance. Therefore, the highest words lie beyond speech, and the highest action requires no action. Shallow wisdom chases the trivial and constantly loses the Way. Where the Dao advances, all things find their proper place."

Bai Gong, unable to restrain himself, later died in the bathhouse. Not understanding the meaning of words, he incited rebellion and thus met with disaster.

Lu said: "Acting in rage without principle, dying to satisfy his impulses—this is how the foolishly ignorant disrupt order."

*Zhenghe* notes: "When a stone is cast into water, it takes form; if one form were cast into another form that had never taken form, not even a skilled diver could retrieve it. When the waters of the Zi and Meng mingle, they acquire flavor; if one flavor were mingled with another flavor that had never manifested, not even Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them. Subtle words are indeed hidden yet not fully revealed, for words, once spoken, exist. Only when the Way is perceived in an instant, without need for sound, does one understand the meaning of words without relying on words themselves. Contending over fish or chasing beasts—these are trivial pursuits. Thus, the highest words must transcend words to be truly profound; the highest action must transcend action to be truly accomplished. How could Bai Gong be worthy of such discourse?"

Fan said: "When a stone is cast into water, a skilled diver can retrieve it; when water is poured into water, a master of flavors can taste the difference. Once something touches the realm of things, there is no escaping detection. Yet those who do not understand the meaning of words—how can one speak with them? Those who do understand the meaning of words need only remain silent, and their intent is already conveyed. To engage in subtle speech, one must be one who understands the meaning of words. Moreover, in the principles of the world, those who fight over fish get wet, and those who chase beasts must run—not because they inherently delight in it, but because the situation compels them. Why is this? Things are moved by stimuli, all arising from the mind. When the mind is fixated, thoughts shift with each passing notion. If speech is careless, even the smallest matter may leak and lead to harm. Thus, the highest words transcend words, appearing as though unspoken; the highest action transcends action, achieving non-action that accomplishes all. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial. Bai Gong’s contention led to his destruction—this is what it means."

Viscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. Muzi was Xin Zhi Gou, a household retainer of Viscount Xiang. The Di were the people of Xieyu. He defeated them and captured Zuoren and Zhongren. Zuoren and Zhongren were two towns in Xieyu. He sent a messenger to report the victory. The messenger, a courier, came to announce the news.

Lu said: "He came in haste to report the triumph."

Viscount Xiang was eating when his expression turned troubled. His attendants said: "In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord appear troubled?"
Viscount Xiang replied: "The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River lasts no more than three days—referring to the ebb and flow of tides. Fierce winds and torrential rains do not last the morning; the sun at its zenith does not linger. What flourishes must inevitably decline."

Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao clan have found no ground for accumulation. Without accumulated virtue yet possessing weighty merit—this cannot but inspire caution and fear. In a single morning, two cities have fallen; if ruin does not overtake them, what will? To never forget the prospect of ruin is the way to avoid ruin.

Lu said: "They have not amassed virtue or piled up good deeds, yet by sheer force they have taken two cities. When things reach their zenith, they must decline—what awaits them but destruction? Thus the wise do not rejoice in greed, for they know the peril of fleeting gain. Only when one understands the fear that comes with reckless success can one begin to accumulate true virtue."

Confucius, hearing of this, said: "The Zhao clan shall prosper. For it is anxiety that brings prosperity, and deep vigilance that sustains it. Joy, on the other hand, is the path to ruin, for it leads to arrogance and boasting. Victory is not the difficult part; maintaining it is. A worthy ruler preserves victory through this principle, and so his blessings extend to later generations. The states of Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed, yet in the end they perished—failing to grasp how to hold their victories. Only a ruler aligned with the Dao can truly sustain victory. Those who conquer their enemies may rival great states, yet if they cannot maintain their triumph, peril and ruin will befall them."

Lu said: "Boasting of merit and flaunting ability bring ruin; anxiety over gain and caution in strength bring prosperity. The worthy ensure blessings for their descendants through this, while those who follow the Dao extend their influence to all living beings—this is what it means to hold victory. To hold victory is to maintain this vigilance and prudence, overcoming the strong and overbearing. Only those who walk the Dao can practice this. Confucius possessed such strength that he could lift the crossbar of a city gate, yet he refused to be known for his power."

*Strength* here means force; *lift* means to raise. Confucius had the power to raise a gate’s crossbar, yet his reputation was not built on force—because he did not rely on it.

Mozi devised defensive strategies, and even Gongshu Ban was subdued, yet he refused to be recognized for his military skill. Gongshu Ban excelled in crafting siege weapons, but Mozi’s defensive designs overcame him, earning Ban’s admiration. Yet Mozi did not claim expertise in warfare—because he did not take pride in his ability.

Thus, those who truly hold victory turn strength into weakness. For weakness is the mother of attack.

Lu said: "Confucius had the strength to lift a gate’s crossbar, and Mozi had the skill to overcome enemies. Yet neither sought fame through force or strategy, but through virtue and the Dao—this is the art of holding victory, of turning strength into weakness. Those who perfect their skills will inevitably be enslaved by others; those who love victory will inevitably encounter stronger foes. Only through virtue, benevolence, and righteousness can one command things and inspire transformation."

*Governance and Harmony* states: To be full yet dwell in emptiness, to be complete yet dwell in deficiency—this is the Way of holding victory. To be firm yet guard with softness, to be strong yet guard with weakness—this is the Way of constant victory.

The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River is diminished by time. The gathering of wind and rain must eventually cease. The sun at its zenith must eventually decline. If even heaven and earth cannot endure forever, how much more so for man? Only those who begin with diligent care end in ease and joy—this is why anxiety brings prosperity. Those who indulge in pleasure and grow idle invite disaster—this is why joy brings ruin. Understanding this ensures blessings for later generations—this is the Way of holding victory.

To possess strength enough to overpower the many yet bear no record of martial prowess, to command armies capable of defeating enemies yet leave no fearsome reputation, to dwell in softness and humility yet overcome the hard and strong—none can surpass this. This is the Way of constant victory. Yet the Way of constant victory is precisely what it means to hold victory.

Fan said: "Winning battles is easy; preserving victory is hard. Thus only a ruler aligned with the Dao can hold victory."

*True Classic of Perfect Virtue, with Four Commentaries, Scroll Twenty* begins.

**Matching Omens**

There was a man of Song devoted to practicing benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. One day, his family’s black ox unexpectedly bore a white calf. He asked Confucius about it, who said: “This is an auspicious omen—offer it in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord.”

A year later, his father suddenly went blind, and the ox again bore a white calf. The father once more instructed his son to consult Confucius. The son said: “Last time we asked, you lost your sight. Why ask again?” The father replied: “The words of a sage first seem contrary but later align. The matter is not yet resolved—ask again for now.” The son returned to question Confucius, who again said: “It is auspicious.” He instructed them to perform the sacrifice.

The son returned and relayed the message. His father said: “Follow Confucius’ words.” A year later, the son also went blind without cause. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital, the people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. All able-bodied men climbed the walls to fight, and more than half died. But this man and his father, both afflicted with blindness, were spared. When the siege lifted, their sight returned. This is what is meant by misfortune and fortune leaning upon each other.

Lu said: “The benevolent love others; the righteous aid all things. To practice this for three generations without ceasing is to accumulate goodness profoundly. If one possesses the talent, it invites emolument; if not, it still brings fortune—this is where blessings concentrate. Auspicious omens are the signs of goodness, ensuring preservation of life and attainment of benefit. Is the reward for accumulated virtue mere empty words?”

Zhenghe said: “Brightness arises from obscurity; order emerges from formlessness. Misfortune leans upon fortune, and fortune harbors misfortune. Who knows their limits? Thus, the principle of mutual dependence has no constancy. Only those of deep virtue enjoy enduring fortune, for blessings take root while misfortune does not come. This is why the man of Song, through practicing benevolence and righteousness, could turn misfortune into fortune.”

Fan said: “An omen in things foretelling fortune is called auspicious; an omen foretelling misfortune is also called auspicious. Is not what we call ‘auspicious’ merely the forerunner of good? Yet when a pig’s omen appears, the father deemed it inauspicious; what shamans and priests call inauspicious, spirits and sages regard as greatly auspicious. For sorrow and joy gather at the same gate, good and ill share the same domain, and the mutual dependence of misfortune and fortune remains unknowable—only the sage understands its workings.”

There was a man of Song called Lanzi, who, whenever people did not recognize his origins, was simply called *Lan*. He sought an audience with Duke Yuan of Song to display his skill: he bound two rods twice his height to his legs, running swiftly while juggling seven swords, five of which remained aloft at once. The Duke was astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk.

Another Lanzi, skilled in acrobatics like today’s tumblers, heard of this and also sought an audience with the Duke. Enraged, the Duke said: “Previously, a man with extraordinary skill sought my favor—he was called Xianqiao. His skill was of no use, but I happened to be in high spirits, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. He must have heard of this and come again, hoping for my reward.” He had the man seized and nearly executed, releasing him only after a month.

Lu said: “One who accumulates benevolence and righteousness to uphold the Dao may preserve fortune; one who relies on strength or skill for luck will not enjoy lasting emolument. Liezi presents these two cases to illustrate the benefits of virtuous conduct.”

Zhenghe said: “Principles have no fixed right, affairs no fixed wrong—they depend on the times one encounters. Yet clinging to skill without understanding the Dao is especially not what can be called a constant Way. The noble person, knowing that allotments are not fixed, is thus careful in advancing or withdrawing.”

Fan said: “Those who meet the times prosper; those who miss them perish. If one indulges a heart bent on seeking advantage while ignorant of timely action, few escape harm.”

Duke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le: “You are advanced in years. Is there anyone among your kin who can seek horses?” (Bo Le was skilled in judging horses.) Bo Le replied: “A good horse can be discerned by its form and bone structure. But the finest horse in the world appears as if vanished, as if lost—it cannot be judged by form, bone, or coat. Such a horse seems to leave no tracks, its speed unmatched. My sons are all mediocre; they can be taught to recognize good horses but not the world’s finest.”

“I have a companion who gathers firewood with me—his name is Jiu Fanggao. In judging horses, he is not inferior to me. I ask to present him to you.” (Jiu Fanggao carried ropes and firewood, a menial task.)

Lu said: "One who carries ropes and firewood is a menial laborer. 'Kin' refers to those of the same clan among one's descendants."

Duke Mu received him and sent him to seek horses. After three months, he returned and reported: "I have found one—it is in Shaqiu." The Duke asked: "What kind of horse is it?" He replied: "A yellow mare." The Duke sent men to fetch it, but it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said: "It is ruined! The man you sent to seek horses—Jiu Fanggao—cannot even distinguish color or sex. How could he know horses?"

Bo Le sighed deeply and said: "Has it truly come to this? This is why he surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure." (This means his skill in judging horses was so extraordinary that he exceeded him by an incalculable degree.)

Lu said: "In judging horses, Fanggao discerned their spirit, not their form. Form is what ordinary people distinguish." Bo Le marveled that he forgot form to grasp the spirit, his focus reaching such singular depth that he deemed himself immeasurably inferior to Fanggao. Thus, Duke Mu saw failure where Bo Le saw ability.

What Fanggao observed was the *heavenly mechanism*—the inner essence that governs the movement of hooves and limbs, grasped in the heart yet not outwardly manifest. He perceived the essence while forgetting the coarse, attended to the inner while disregarding the outer. (The "essence" refers to the heavenly mechanism; the "coarse" refers to sex and coat color.) He saw only what was to be seen—the heavenly mechanism alone.

He does not see what is not to be seen—what is not to be seen is sex and coat color. He gazes upon what is to be gazed upon, attending only to what ought to be seen, never forgetting what he sees while disregarding what he ought not. What ought not to be seen is not worth his attention.

In Fanggao’s judgment of horses, there was something more valuable than the horse itself. His art was not merely about judging horses; what his spirit grasped must have been something far nobler than mere equine appraisal—such was its marvel. When the horse arrived, it proved to be a steed of the world.

Lu said: "Form and substance are the manifest aspects of the myriad things, while spirit and qi are the subtle, formless essence. That which moves the formed is itself formless; that which employs the formless gives shape to things. We use it all day without perceiving its work, operate it all year without feeling its labor. To know and nurture it is to master the Dao.

Fanggao saw what he saw through spirit, for he connected with the horse’s spirit and thus valued what transcended the horse. Others do not know what he valued.

*Zhenghe* states: The Dao resides in the formless. It vanishes as if extinguished, eludes sight as if lost; it cannot be grasped, leaves no dust nor track, and pursuit cannot reach it. Mediocre scholars and lesser talents—how could they comprehend this? What can be spoken of is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped in thought is their essence. To attain the essence while forgetting the coarse is beyond the reach of words. To know the outer while remaining ignorant of the inner, or to dwell within while forgetting the outer—this is knowledge that transcends knowing.

He sees only what is to be seen and not what is not; this is why his seeing is unique. He gazes only upon what ought to be gazed upon and not upon what ought not; this is why his gaze is divine. Since what he seeks does not lie within form and bones, what he attains is not confined to the superficialities of form, name, or reputation—this is the way of advancing toward the sage’s Dao.

The fine horse is an analogy for talent; the steed of the world is an analogy for the sage’s Dao.

Fan said: A yellow mare and a black stallion—how vastly different they are! Yet in Fanggao’s judgment of horses, he grasped the essence and forgot the coarse, attended to the inner while disregarding the outer, penetrated the marvel of the heavenly mechanism, and remained oblivious to color, sex, or outward traits. This is why Bo Le sighed in awe, deeming himself immeasurably inferior to Fanggao.

King Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He: "How should one govern the state?"
Zhan He, a recluse, replied: "Your servant is enlightened in cultivating the self but not in governing the state."
The king said: "I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain; I wish to learn how to preserve them."
Zhan He replied: "I have never heard of a well-ordered self leading to a disordered state, nor of a disordered self leading to a well-ordered state. Thus, the root lies in the self; I dare not respond with mere branches."
The king said: "Well spoken."

Lu said: To diminish things for the sake of enriching life is the common inclination of petty men; to diminish life for the sake of benefiting things is the deceptive conduct of those who crave fame. To secure the altars of soil and grain, one must place the self last; to cultivate the self well is to ensure the state governs itself. The ruler is the master of the state; the spirit is the master of the body. Governing the state depends on pacifying the ruler; cultivating the self depends on pacifying the spirit. When the spirit is at peace, the Dao is exalted; when the Dao is exalted, the state is well-ordered. The spirit is the root of the self; the Dao is the function of the spirit. Thus, I dared not respond with mere branches.

*Zhenghe* states: The root of the state lies in the self. Therefore, those who illuminate virtue throughout the world, wishing to govern their state, first cultivate themselves—this is what is meant by "ordering the root so the branches follow." The ancients used the truth of the Dao to cultivate the self, and its remnants were applied to the state. How could a well-ordered self lead to a disordered state?

Fan said: The root of the state lies in the family; the root of the family lies in the self. What else does one who governs well require but to return to the root?

Zhan He’s fishing relied on using the weak to overcome the strong. By employing the light to attain the heavy, one may speak of governing the state. If one is truly capable of this, then the world may be moved within a single grasp. From this perspective, applying such a mind to other matters would surely render what was once neglected as effortless.

The elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao, a grand minister of Chu: "There are three resentments a man may incur—do you know them?" (Huqiu was the name of a town; *zhangren* refers to an elder.) Sunshu Ao replied: "What are they?" The elder answered: "Those of high rank are envied by others; those in great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emoluments are pursued by grievances." Sunshu Ao said: "As my rank rises higher, my aspirations grow humbler; as my office grows greater, my heart grows smaller; as my emoluments grow richer, my generosity grows wider. By this, may I avoid the three resentments?"

Lu commented: "A heart that grows humbler with higher rank is the function of the Dao; generosity that grows wider with greater wealth is the function of virtue. One who employs the Dao to humble himself incurs no resentment; one who employs virtue to extend his bounty earns the lord’s favor. From whence could the three resentments arise?"

*Zhenghe* states: The noble man does not seek to elevate others excessively. As his rank grows higher, his heart grows humbler—this is how he avoids the envy of others and suffers no loss. As his office grows greater, his heart grows smaller—this is how he avoids the lord’s suspicion and suffers no loss. As his emoluments grow richer, his generosity grows wider—this is how he avoids the pursuit of grievances and suffers no loss. Such abundance is called "holding the rear while occupying the front."

Fan said: Sunshu Ao thrice served as prime minister without vanity, and thrice resigned without distress. With such a disposition, he was bound to avoid resentment wherever he went.

When Sunshu Ao fell ill and neared death, he instructed his son: "The king has repeatedly offered me a fief, but I have not accepted it. After my death, the king will surely enfeoff you. You must not accept fertile land. Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qinqiu—this land is barren, and its name is most inauspicious. The people of Chu revere ghosts, while the people of Yue believe in omens." (Lu notes: The character *ji* is pronounced *jiyi* or *jixi*. The *Huainan Tradition* states: "The people of Wu revere ghosts; the people of Yue believe in *ji* [portents].") "Only this place may be held in perpetuity." After Sunshu Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son fertile land. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead, and it was granted to him.

To this day, it has not been lost. The Han minister Xiao He likewise said: "Let not your descendants be overpowered by powerful families"—this is of the same principle.

Lu notes: What men contend for, the strong will surely seize; what yields little profit, men will not vie for. That which is not contested may be long enjoyed, while that which is fiercely disputed cannot be eternally preserved. Men know only to contend for immediate gain, not that lasting possession brings deeper profit. Thus, desire is the ground of contention, while preserving the Way is the path to enduring prosperity. One skilled in the Way extends this principle to all things—wherever he goes, how can it not be the Way?

*Zhenghe* states: When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. Only he who dwells where the multitude shun and does not contend approaches the Way and may endure.

Fan notes: The ancients who attained the Way dwelt where others recoiled, not allowing personal preferences to burden their hearts. The enfeoffment of Qinqiu was how Sunshu Ao admonished his son.

Niu Que was a great Confucian of Shangdang. Traveling to Handan, he encountered bandits in the reeds of Ou Sha, who took all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away unhurried, gazing back with a joyful countenance, free of distress or regret. The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. He replied: "A noble man does not harm what sustains him for the sake of what sustains him." The bandits exclaimed: "Ah! How worthy!"

Then they conferred among themselves, saying: "With his worthiness, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao, he will surely expose us—this will surely bring us to ruin. Better to kill him." So they pursued and slew him together.

When the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another: "If you encounter bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang." All took the lesson to heart. Soon after, Niu’s younger brother traveled to Qin. Arriving at the palace gates, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he struggled fiercely against them. When this proved futile, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: "We spared your life generously, yet you hound us without end—your tracks will soon be exposed. Once a bandit, where is your humanity?" They killed him on the spot, slaying four or five of his companions as well.

Niu Que brought misfortune upon himself by refusing to show regret, while the people of Yan, though pretending to cherish life, met with disaster. The unpredictability of safety and peril is of this kind.

Lu observes: He who knows the times and responds to principle acts without confusion when events arise, seizes opportunity when it comes, moves in accord with truth, and aligns with change. But to display one’s name and leave traces without regard for timing is to court failure at every turn. Niu Que did not know the times, and his brother overreached—much like the two sons of the Meng clan, who diverged from the paths of Wen and Wu. Those who force reputation beyond measure never escape such consequences.

*Zhenghe* states: Life cannot be preserved by valuing it, nor the body enriched by cherishing it—this is what befell Niu Que. The wealthy harm themselves with indulgence, the poor burden their bodies with profit—this is what befell the people of Yan. Thus, those who treat life lightly are not exempt from calamity, while those who cling to it remain entangled. This is why the sage regards the body as a great affliction.

Fan remarks: Niu Que invited misfortune by refusing regret, while the people of Yan met harm through forceful resistance. The workings of fortune and misfortune cannot be foreseen—such is the way of things.

Yu Shi was a wealthy man of Liang. His household overflowed with abundance, his wealth and silk beyond measure, his treasures beyond estimation. He would ascend a high tower overlooking the main road, where he set out music and wine and played *bo* on the upper floor. As knights-errant passed by, the gamblers on the tower would shoot dice—when the bright *qiong* piece landed true, they would reverse two *yu* pieces and burst into laughter. (The bright *qiong* was a die with five white faces; rolling five whites won the game, reversing two *yu* pieces secured victory, hence their laughter.) Just then, a kite swooped down and dropped a rotting rat onto the board. The knights-errant conferred: "Yu Shi has reveled in wealth and pleasure for too long, yet he constantly scorns others. Though we have not provoked him, he insults us with this rotting rat. If we do not avenge this, we cannot establish our reputation in the world." (Reputation for bravery.) They vowed in unison: "Let us join forces and lead our followers to destroy his household and all its equals." All agreed.

On the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons to attack Yu Shi’s estate, utterly annihilating his family. The ruin wrought by arrogance and extravagance follows no single path. Yu Shi harbored no intent to humiliate others, yet his household was destroyed—this too stemmed from his failure to cultivate humility and restraint in better times.

Lu observes: The previous chapter spoke of how the study of benevolence and righteousness brought blessings to the Three Dynasties, while this chapter shows how arrogance and extravagance invite disaster in a single day. When conduct lacks steadfastness, flying calamities strike. Fortune and misfortune have no fixed gate—they are summoned by man alone. These paired examples serve as profound warnings.

*Zhenghe* states: Fortune and misfortune come as man summons them. Yet who knows the reasons for Heaven’s displeasure?

Fan remarks: The Way rejects extravagance and excess. Extravagance corrupts virtue, excess strains one’s nature—how can this be the Way? Yu Shi reveled in wealth and pleasure for too long, indulging his scornful heart and abandoning humility and reverence. Thus, his ruin came swiftly, standing ready to befall him.

In the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. While traveling, he starved by the roadside. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu ate three mouthfuls, his vision cleared, and he asked: "Who are you?" The man replied: "I am Qiu of Hufu." Yuan Jingmu exclaimed: "Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why feed me? I will not eat your food on principle." He pressed his hands to the ground and retched, but nothing came up. Gagging repeatedly, he collapsed and died.

The man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To condemn the food as stolen merely because the giver was a bandit and refuse to eat it—this is to confuse name and reality.

Lu observes: To seek reputation at the cost of reality, to violate the Way and forfeit life—does this not describe Yuan Jingmu? The man of the Way acts otherwise: he transforms the bandit’s heart, perfecting his humanity. By embodying the Way, others bathe in his influence. The noble man rescues the imperiled, preserving both himself and the giver. To retch is to lose both, and to gag repeatedly—what pretense of foolishness is this?

*Zhenghe* states: The excesses of the worthy make the Way difficult to practice. This is the narrowness of Boyi, which the noble man does not follow.

Fan remarks: A haughty offer is spurned even by beggars; food given with contempt is refused even by the starving. How much more so when the giver is called a bandit? Yet there are those who turn others away beyond the city gates—when their exchange is guided by the Way and their gifts by ritual, even Confucius would accept them. Would he refuse food merely because the giver was a bandit?

Zhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju but considered himself unappreciated and lived by the sea. In summer, he ate water caltrop and water chestnut; in winter, acorns and chestnuts. When Duke Ao faced danger, Zhu Lishu bid farewell to his friend and went to die for him. His friend said: "You left because you believed yourself unappreciated. Now you go to die for him—does this not erase the distinction between appreciation and lack of it?" Zhu Lishu replied: "Not so. I left because I believed myself unappreciated. Now, in dying, I prove that I was indeed unappreciated. I will die to shame those rulers of later times who fail to recognize their ministers."

Those who recognize their worth will die for it, while those who do not will not—this is the conduct of one who follows the straight Way. Zhu Lishu may be called one who resented injustice to the point of forgetting himself.

Lu said: "He never truly knew you, yet you died to prove his ignorance—how could this be the conduct of one who walks the Way? Such foolish attachment to reputation abounds, far removed from those who preserve life and treasure the Dao."

Zhenghe said: "The noble person may sacrifice their life to perfect benevolence, for benevolence cannot be abandoned; or lay down their life to uphold righteousness, for righteousness cannot be refused. Yet resentment, lacking any proper outlet, serves only to destroy the body. Those who cannot restrain their anger or curb their desires, who deliberately defy convention to squander their lives—such have never heard the great Way of the noble person."

Fan said: "Death may weigh heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a goose feather—it depends entirely on how one meets it. Dying is not difficult; how one dies is. When Prince Jiu faced peril, Shao Hu died while Guan Zhong did not. The ancients never failed to criticize the prince yet praised Guan Zhong—how much more so in cases of mere unrecognized worth? To resent injustice to the point of forgetting oneself is not what the noble person values."

Yang Zhu said: "Benefits bestowed will truly reach others; resentments borne will bring harm in return. Benefits do not travel alone, nor do resentments spread universally—this is the natural order. What arises within will find response without: this is *qing* (emotion)." *Qing* here should read *emotion*. What emotion stirs reaches without regard for distance or depth. Thus the worthy are cautious in what they express. Goodness made manifest brings auspicious response; evil accumulated invites calamity.

Lu said: "This *qing* is as if one summons it oneself. The coming of fortune or misfortune is like shadow and echo—thus the worthy are cautious in what they express."

Nowadays, those who admire the Dao all cast off the teachings of names and rites, lightly abandoning ritual and law. They indulge their emotions and follow their own inclinations, believing this to be mastery of life; they treat duty as shackles, dwellings as mere garments, and scorn karmic retribution while neglecting human affairs. Thus Ji Kang’s followers perished without time to reflect, while Xi Kang’s generation hated the world as an enemy yet never grasped the true principle.

Zhenghe said: "Words issue from oneself and affect others; conduct begins near yet is seen afar. Words may invite disaster, actions may bring disgrace—the noble person cannot but be cautious. The saying that what arises within finds response without refers to the coming of fortune or misfortune, honor or disgrace, which are summoned solely by oneself."

Fan said: "Fortune and misfortune have no gate—they are summoned only by oneself. The coming of honor or disgrace reflects one’s virtue. What goes forth from you returns to you—can one not be cautious?"

Yangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. Having already led his own kinsmen in pursuit, he then asked Yangzi’s servant to join the chase. Yangzi said: "Hmm, why so many in pursuit of one lost sheep?" The neighbor replied: "There are many branching paths." When they returned, Yangzi asked: "Did you recover the sheep?" The neighbor said: "It is lost." Yangzi asked: "How was it lost?" The neighbor said: "Among the branching paths, there were further branches. I knew not where to go, so I turned back."

Yangzi’s countenance fell into sorrow, and for a long while he did not speak. For the rest of the day, he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked: "The sheep is a lowly beast, and moreover not your own. Why has this diminished your words and smiles?" Yangzi did not answer, and his disciples could not fathom his intent.

Disciple Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi. Another day, Xin Duzi came with Meng Sunyang and asked: "Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu. They studied under the same master and returned home having advanced in the Way of benevolence and righteousness. Their father said..."

The father asked: "What is this Way of benevolence and righteousness like?"

The eldest son said: "Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my body first, then my reputation. I dare not harm even my hair or skin."

The second son said: "Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my body to achieve renown. I do not seek life at the cost of benevolence, but embrace death to fulfill it."

The youngest son said: "Benevolence and righteousness allow me to preserve both body and reputation. Being enlightened and wise, I safeguard myself."

These three paths diverge yet all stem from Confucianism. Which is right, and which is wrong?

Yangzi said: "There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, bold in swimming, he ferried passengers for a living, supporting his hundred-member household. Those who came with provisions to learn from him formed a crowd, yet nearly half drowned. They came to learn swimming, not drowning, yet the outcomes were so divergent. Which is right, and which is wrong?"

Xin Duzi left in silence. Meng Sunyang reproached him: "Why did you ask such a roundabout question, and why did the Master answer so obliquely? I am even more confused."

Xin Duzi said: "The great Way loses the sheep through many branching paths; scholars lose their lives through many methods. Though their fundamental learning is not different, nor their root distinct, their ends diverge so widely. Only by returning to unity can one avoid loss and gain. You have long studied at the Master’s gate, practiced the Master’s Way, yet fail to grasp his circumstances—how lamentable!

Lu said: "The sheep was lost by straying from the spirit; guarding the spirit without fail is the Way. Once the sheep is lost and one rushes along branching paths, it cannot be recovered. Simply guard the spirit, and there will be no loss or gain, no dependence."

Zhenghe said: "Since the Daoist arts were divided by the world, the Hundred Schools have gone forth and not returned. Thus, the people of the world each follow their own methods, fragmented and scattered, no longer seeing the great wholeness of the ancients. This is why many paths lose the sheep, and many methods lose lives. 'Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my body first, then my reputation'—this is like the departure of Viscount Wei. 'They make me sacrifice my body to achieve renown'—this is like the death of Bi Gan. 'They allow me to preserve both body and reputation'—this is like the wisdom of Viscount Ji. Yet these three benevolent ones all returned to the same Way. If the people of the world, though taking different roads, could return to the same destination, there would be no gain or loss."

Fan said: "The Way does not desire complexity; complexity leads to multiplicity, and multiplicity to disorder. Those who embody the Way unify it with singular focus—how could multiplicity be valued? Converging different roads into one return, encompassing a hundred considerations into a single principle—this is near to the Way."

Yang Zhu’s younger brother, Bu, went out wearing white clothes. When it rained, he removed his white garments and returned in black. His dog, not recognizing him, barked as it ran to meet him. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. Yang Zhu said: "Do not strike it. You would do the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could you not find it strange?"

This passage clarifies that when one’s own form changes, external things cannot comprehend it, hence the arising of right and wrong. To seek nothing within oneself and blame others exclusively is like Yang Bu, who changed his clothes and was surprised by his dog’s barking.

Lu said: "Guard truth and return to unity, and even seagulls can be tamed. Lose the Way and alter constancy, and even a household dog will grow fearful."

Zhenghe said: "The conduct of the noble person is inwardly guarded and outwardly unchanging. Some know white but uphold black; some value black but esteem white—ordinary people surely do not understand. If one loses the true essence of their nature and outwardly changes between white and black, how can one prevent others from finding it strange?"

Fan said: "Things change without constancy, right and wrong vary. To know that it is so but not why it is so is delusion. Distinguishing true and false by force, names and realities shifting by morning and evening, praise and blame confusing again and again—is this not bewildering?"

Yang Zhu said: "Acting with goodness not for the sake of reputation, yet reputation follows; reputation does not seek profit, yet profit comes; profit does not invite conflict, yet conflict arrives. Thus, the noble person must be cautious in doing good. In wisdom, others contend with you; in strength, others compete with you—this is the natural order. There has never been one who dwells amid profit and reputation yet avoids calamity."

As the saying goes: "In doing good, do not seek nearness to fame." Is this not true?

Lu said: "Goodness that seeks reputation is what people inevitably contend over. Thus, 'in doing good, do not seek nearness to fame' means not contending with others for profit. Doing what others cannot do without boasting—this is being cautious in doing good."

Zhenghe said: "Goodness does not seek reputation, yet reputation comes of itself; reputation does not seek profit, yet profit comes of itself. Wealth and goods gather, and those who see them contend—thus their flow generates disaster. The sage sees the outcome to know the beginning, observes the past to know the future. Therefore, in the issuance of words and actions, one must be cautious in solitude."

*Zhuangzi* says: "In doing good, do not seek nearness to fame."

Fan said: "Goodness is what people desire. Once there is desire, some may pursue fame without rest, some may chase profit without satisfaction, risking their very nature and life to contend for it. They will resort to plunder, deceit, and every kind of falsehood. Thus, Bo Yi starved at the foot of Mount Shouyang, while Robber Zhi raged atop Dongling. Is this not bewildering?"

Formerly, there was a man who claimed to know the Way to immortality. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it, but before success, the teacher died. The Lord of Yan was furious and was about to punish the envoy. A favored minister advised: "What people fear most is nothing so urgent as death; what they value most is nothing beyond life. He himself lost his life—how could he enable the lord to avoid death?" Thus, the envoy was not punished.

There was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Way. Hearing that the teacher had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi heard of this and laughed: "He wished to learn the Way to immortality, yet when the teacher died, he still regretted it—this is not knowing why one studies."

Huzi said: Fuzi’s words are wrong. Generally, there are those who possess a technique but cannot practice it, and there are those who can practice it but do not possess the technique. There was a man of Wei skilled in calculation who, on the verge of death, explained its principles to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. Another man asked him, and he recounted what his father had said. The questioner applied the words and practiced the technique, matching his father’s skill without discrepancy. If this is so, how can it be said that the dead cannot transmit living techniques? Some things can be spoken of but not practiced, while others can be practiced but not spoken of—such are the differences in talent and nature.

Lu said: There are those who claim to possess techniques but merely speak empty words to argue principles, never having practiced or verified them themselves. Thus, people doubt their words, believing them to be untrue. Therefore, this passage speaks of those who know, those who know but cannot practice, and those who practice but do not know. Thus, knowing without practicing, practicing without knowing, or neither practicing nor knowing—though all may attain understanding—are not without distinction. How much more worthy is one who hears and practices, gaining enlightenment through understanding, than one who does not know the words?

Zhenghe said: Little Liang possessed the talent of a sage but not the Way of a sage; Lady Ou possessed the Way of a sage but not the talent of a sage. Some have the talent, others the Way—this is why none fully attain sagehood. Those who expound but cannot practice are said to have the Way; those who can practice but lack the technique are said to have talent. If the Way of the sage is taught to one with the talent of a sage, they may yet become a sage. Who says the dead cannot transmit living techniques?

Fan said: This speaks of how people’s talents and natures differ. The people of Handan presented doves to Viscount Jian on New Year’s Day, and the viscount was greatly pleased, rewarding them generously. A guest asked the reason, and Viscount Jian replied: “On New Year’s Day, I release living creatures to show my benevolence.” The guest said: “The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them, and many die. If you wish to preserve life, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them—your kindness does not compensate for the harm.” Viscount Jian said: “So it is.”

Lu said: What people consider good are all the branches of affairs. If one addresses the root, which most cannot comprehend, the effort is doubled compared to tending the branches—such is the case here. Thus, petty kindness is the thief of great kindness. The traces of name-based teachings are the branches; the workings of the Great Dao are the root. Most people see the small but do not recognize the great. Therefore, I briefly cite the release of doves to illustrate this grand principle.

Zhenghe said: Heaven and earth, in their forms, colors, wisdom, and power, allow the myriad things to fulfill themselves. The sage’s virtue of cherishing life is likewise all-encompassing. Tian of Qi held a sacrifice in his courtyard, with a thousand retainers in attendance. During the feast, someone presented fish and wild geese. Tian gazed at them and sighed: “Heaven is bountiful to the people. It grows the five grains and gives birth to fish and birds for their use.” The retainers echoed his words in unison. Bao’s son, twelve years old, was present and stepped forward, saying: “It is not as you say. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and we are born together as the same kind. There is no nobility or baseness among kinds. Though all are living kinds, they esteem themselves and despise others. They merely dominate one another by size, wisdom, and power, devouring each other in turn—not born for one another’s sake. People take what is edible and eat it—did Heaven originally create them for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats bite skin, and tigers and wolves eat flesh—did Heaven originally create mosquitoes and gnats to feed on humans, or tigers and wolves to feed on flesh?”

Lu said: Those that eat flesh devour one another, extinguishing Heaven’s principle—how could this be Heaven’s intent? Bao’s words strike the proper principle. There was once a vulgar scholar who said that Fuxi invented nets and traps, and Suiren cooked meat to eat—yet those two emperors were sages. How far are sages from tigers that eat flesh? The sutras of the Buddha, though not from the sages of China, restrain people for their benefit. The Buddha is a sage of the six penetrations, restraining consciousness for the teaching, universally benefiting sentient beings. Now, the book of Liezi again clarifies this meaning—thus, the teachings of the Great Dao have never differed.

Zhenghe said: Heaven and earth are born with me; the myriad things and I are one. Thus, the similar and dissimilar are all of the same kind. Yet from the descent of forms and names, the large dominate the small, the near and far take from one another, the high and low vie with each other, and the ebb and flow of wisdom and power are all as they naturally are. Therefore, the sage’s Way is to let the myriad things be as they are and not act.

Fan said: People cherish all things. How can releasing creatures to show kindness truly be so? Heaven gives birth to all things. How can it be said that it creates things for the people’s use? In Qi, there was a poor man who constantly begged in the city. The city’s people, troubled by his frequent appeals, gave him nothing. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, working as an assistant to the horse doctor to obtain food. Someone in the capital mocked him: “Working for a horse doctor for food—is this not shameful?” The beggar replied: “Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how is working for a horse doctor shameful?” He did not consider working for a horse doctor a disgrace. This passage speaks of things reaching their extreme in one place—once distinctions are set, there is no longer any sense of shame or honor. How much more so for those who naturally equalize gain and loss?

Lu said: There are scholars who break their limbs or lick sores to gain advancement—this too is seeking clothing and food. Serving at the gate of a lowly physician is also seeking clothing and food. Those who gain much profit consider it honorable; those who gain little consider it shameful. Who among people truly knows the reality of honor and shame?

"In the *Zhenghe* era: Viewed through the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness; viewed through custom, nobility and baseness do not reside in things. Once this is understood, then the world’s shames are not enough to shame one’s person. This is what those who embody the Dao value.

There was a man of Song who, while traveling on the road, found a contract someone had lost and discarded. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its teeth-like notches. The carved marks resembled teeth. He told his neighbor: ‘My wealth is imminent.’ Those who grasp at empty names to seek substance are like this man clutching a lost contract to seek riches."

Lu said: "The common people, deluded by empty names and losing sight of true principle, are all like one who picks up a lost water contract, calculates the number of its notches, and awaits wealth. It is also like feeling no shame at begging in the marketplace yet feeling shame at serving others. How is this different from a runaway slave who abandons his master to serve another, performing the same labor yet believing himself no longer bound to anyone? Following deluded emotions and losing sight of true meaning—all such cases are of this kind."

"In the *Zhenghe* era: What the world values as the Dao is books. Though the Dao is transmitted through books, it is not something books can truly capture. Those who rely on empty words to seek the Dao are far from the Dao indeed. Clutching a lost contract to await wealth—this illustrates the point."

Fan said: "Those who focus on inner observation understand the limits of sufficiency, so serving a horse doctor brings no shame. Those who crave external admiration indulge boundless desires, so they clutch lost contracts hoping for wealth.

A man had a withered parasol tree. His neighbor’s elder said withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man immediately cut it down. Though the elder’s words were fair, they were misplaced. The neighbor’s elder then asked to take it as firewood. This treads on dubious ground. The man became displeased, saying: ‘The neighbor’s elder only wanted firewood and taught me to cut it down.’ In matters of doubt, things cannot be trusted. To have such a treacherous neighbor—how can this be? "

Lu said: "Advising him to cut the tree was fair; asking for it as firewood was reasonable. Yet suspicion arose from the request after the advice. Thus it is said: ‘What people fear, one cannot but fear. Do not think it harmless—its calamity will grow.’ This is the meaning."

"In the *Zhenghe* era: In the realm of suspicion, every encounter breeds doubt, which is why the Dao cannot be practiced."

Fan said: "There was a rich man of Song whose wall collapsed in the rain. His son said: ‘If it is not repaired, thieves will come.’ The neighbor’s elder said the same. That evening, the family indeed lost much of their wealth. They trusted their son but suspected the neighbor’s elder. Thus, treading on dubious ground and misplacing words—how can one prevent others from doubting?

A man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. His gait seemed like an axe-thief; his expression, like an axe-thief; his speech, like an axe-thief; his movements and manner—nothing was not like an axe-thief. Later, he dug in his grain field and found the axe. The next time he saw his neighbor’s son, his movements and manner no longer resembled an axe-thief. When the mind is biased and deluded, it shifts with one’s thoughts. In extreme cases, white and black become the same color, square and round share the same form—can external things truly alter them? Thus the saying: ‘The myriad affairs, tangled and confused, all arise from the mind.’"

Lu said: "Many disasters arise from resemblance and doubt. Even a falling kite or a rat can cause suspicion. Only those who accumulate virtue, guard the Dao, and harbor no private attachments can avoid calamity. Thus, losing an axe and suspecting a neighbor—these are one and the same."

"In the *Zhenghe* era: Harboring a suspicious mind leads to obstruction everywhere. This is why the Dao remains obscure."

Fan said: "The myriad things, tangled and confused, all arise from the mind. When the mind is biased, it shifts with thoughts. Moreover, when something probes the clarity within, it sinks and drowns one’s true nature. Becoming infatuated with external goods, things transform. This is even more severe than suspecting an axe-thief.

Bai Gongsheng’s thoughts were in chaos. *Lü* here means ‘to consider’—he was plotting rebellion. After court, he stood still, inverted his staff, and its tip pierced his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he did not know it. A man of Zheng heard of this and said: ‘If he could forget his chin, what would he not forget?’ When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over a tree stump or bump one’s head against a post without realizing it."

"In the *Zhenghe* era: Where the mind is fixed, the body is forgotten. Once, a man of Qi coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed and went to the market. Arriving at a gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and left. The authorities arrested him and asked: ‘With people all around, why did you seize their gold?’ He replied: ‘When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.’ The chaos of craving distorts the human heart to such an extent. Thus the ancients said: ‘One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who tunes the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder.’ When the mind is swiftly attached to external things, even great forms and sounds are missed. How much more so for one whose heart abides by principle, restrains emotions, gathers thoughts, and remains still and settled—can the movements of the myriad things disturb them?"

Lu said: "Zhang Zhan said: ‘The chaos of craving distorts the human heart to such an extent.’ Thus it is said: ‘One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who listens to the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder.’ When the mind is fixed, the body is forgotten—all such cases are like this. This passage speaks of the great harm in indulging desires: the loss of one’s person and the destruction of one’s nature."

"Now, one seeks to enrich the body with that which destroys it. If one could be without this body, what use would gold have? To speak of being without the body is not to annihilate it, but merely to refrain from indulgence.

*Commentary (Zhenghe edition):* To perceive gain and forget form, to see profit and forget truth—this is how the worldly lose themselves to things. This chapter concludes with the tale of seizing gold, echoing the *Tianrui*’s account of thievery.

Fan said: When Duke Bai contemplated rebellion, he took up a thornwood staff with a spike to pierce his skull; when the man of Qi seized gold, he did so in the marketplace amid the gentry. The mind becomes so fixated that the body is forgotten—how can one not be cautious of such tendencies?"

*The Twenty-First Scroll of the Four Commentaries on the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue concludes.*
