**The Authentic Scripture of Penetrating Spirit, Fascicle One**
Annotated by He Can

**1. The All-Encompassing Dao**
When the mind merges with the ultimate void, virtue penetrates the subtle and mysterious. Its merit aligns with the four seasons, and the common people transform of themselves.

Kang Cangzi dwelled on the southern slope of Mount Yu for three years. *Mount Yu*, as recorded in the *Yugong* chapter of the *Book of Documents*, lies in Xuzhou. The *Canon of Shun* states: "Gun was executed at Mount Yu." It was situated in the eastern frontier and later belonged to Lu. *Southern slope* refers to the mountain’s southern face. The *Zhuangzi* cites this passage as: "He dwelled north of Mount Kunlun," which refers to this same mountain. The local customs knew no plagues or pestilence, and the grain harvests ripened in succession. Where the worthy and sagely dwell, Heaven protects and spirits aid, so that nearby regions suffer no plagues or pestilence, and the five grains yield abundant harvests. *Successive ripening* is called *still*. The people secretly said to one another...

When Master Kangcang first arrived, I was struck with astonishment—*fresh with wonder* describes my reaction. I marveled at his empty heart and tranquil stillness, so far removed from common sentiment. Now, as I reckon each day, I find it lacking, yet when I tally the year, I find it abundant. Could he be a sage? Having witnessed his beneficence, I suspect he may indeed be one. Why do we not together enthrone him in sacrifice and worship him as our lord, establishing ancestral temples and honoring both soil and grain? Why not offer him the ritual vessels, perform the invocations, and serve him as our sovereign?

When Master Kangcang heard this, his expression showed unease. His disciple Yanshuai, following his lead, sought to persuade him. *Yanshuai was one of Master Kangcang’s disciples.* Wishing to fulfill the people’s desire, he thus urged his master. Master Kangcang replied: I have heard that the perfected one dwells like a corpse in a humble chamber, while the common folk roam wildly, unaware of where they go. The perfected one, with a heart stilled and thoughts extinguished, resembles a corpse—free from affairs, he abides alone in his modest dwelling. Yet the people, drawn by admiration, flock to him in devotion. But when one examines their allegiance, it is not born of wisdom. Now, the elders and youths of Yu’s folk whisper among themselves, preparing to honor me with ritual vessels. Am I truly such a man? I originally sought seclusion to preserve the Way and follow my true nature. Now, to be exalted with ritual vessels is to become the very mark of worldly distinction. This is why I remain unsettled by the words of Lao Dan: "I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I refrain from meddling, and the people prosper on their own; I cherish stillness, and the people correct themselves." Yet now, the opposite has come to pass. Thus, I cannot set aside my disquiet.

Yanshuai said:

"Nay,"—"nay" means "not so." Consider the shallow puddle: the great fish cannot turn its body within it, while minnows and loaches dominate its bounds. The modest hillock: the mighty beast cannot conceal its frame upon it, while wretched foxes claim its omens. A length of eight *chi* is called a *xun*; twice that is a *chang*. A *wu* is a pool. *Huan* means to turn back. The *ni* is a small fish with legs. *Zhi* means to monopolize. Six *chi* make a *bu*; seven *chi* make a *ren*. *Nie* signifies misfortune. *Xiang* means auspiciousness. Thus, shallow waters cannot contain the great fish, nor can small hills hide the massive beast. This illustrates that one as lofty as Kang Cang must require ample emolument.

Moreover, to honor the worthy and employ the capable, to incline toward goodness and pursue advantage—this has been the way since the time of Yao and Shun. How much more so for the folk of Yu? Sir, you should heed this.

Kang Cangzi said: "Ah, come! Ah!"—*Xi* is an exclamation, expressing surprise at their failure to grasp his intent. Wishing to instruct them in loftier matters, he called out, "Come!"

"Do those two understand?"—The "two" refer to Yao and Shun. "Understand?" implies, "How could they?" The beast that fills a carriage, once parted from the mountain, is ensnared by nets and traps. The fish that swallows a boat, once cast from the water, is tormented by ants and crickets. Thus, birds and beasts seek the heights for their dwelling, while fish and turtles seek the depths. For one who preserves his form and life, to conceal himself requires nothing less than profound obscurity. *Han* means fullness. *Jie* means solitary. *Miao* means distant.

I speak to you of the roots of great disorder, which trace back to the era of Yao and Shun and will endure for a thousand generations hence. In a thousand generations, there will surely be men who devour one another. *Ruo* means "you." For matters may begin in success and end in failure, start with fortune and conclude with misfortune—how can one be certain? Thus, Yao and Shun’s abdication brought a momentary glory, but their legacy flowed into later ages, giving rise to usurpation and regicide. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Yao and Shun abdicated and became emperors; Zhi Kuai abdicated and perished. Tang and Wu contended and reigned; Bai Gong contended and was destroyed." Is this not the proof?

Only by refusing to establish a reputation for goodness can one ensure that no traces remain to invite emulation. Before he could finish speaking, the man Rongzhi Chu’s countenance darkened, and he drew his knees close upon his mat, saying: "My years advance ever onward—how may I entrust my life’s work to these words?" Rongzhi Chu is the Nan Rong Chu of whom *Zhuangzi* speaks. Having heard such profound teachings, his expression changed, and he gathered himself upon his seat, entreating instruction with reverence.

Kang Cangzi said: "Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts churn restlessly. If you persist in this until the end of your days, you may yet attain these words. *Yingying* means ceaseless motion. *Xu* means conclusion. To preserve form and embrace life is to still the churning of thought, emptying the mind into profound stillness, where the Dao naturally abides. If you do so until the end of your days, you may attain these words.

Yet my talents are meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to seek my master, Dan?"—Dan is the courtesy name of Laozi.

Kang Cangzi, having dismissed Rongzhi Chu, did not abandon the folk of Yu but soared like a dragon through the world. *Xie* means to send away. "Did not abandon the folk of Yu" means he remained in reclusion, wandering like a dragon, ascending and descending with the times.

Water’s nature is to be clear, but earth muddies it, so it cannot remain clear. Man’s nature is to live long, but things muddy it, so he cannot attain longevity. *Gu* means disorder. Man’s nature is to live a full span, but external things disorder it, preventing him from completing his natural years.

Things exist to nourish our nature, yet the deluded of this age often use their nature to nourish things, failing to distinguish weight from lightness. Clothing and food nourish our nature and cannot be lacking for even a day. Yet the deluded harm their nature in pursuit of things, accumulating more while their nature suffers ever greater injury—unaware that nature is weighty and things are light. This is a complete inversion.

Thus, the sage’s approach to sounds, colors, and flavors is this: if they benefit his nature, he takes them; if they harm his nature, he discards them. This is the way to preserve one’s nature. A thousand men draw their bows, all aiming at a single target, and the target is struck without fail. A thousand things clamor, all harming a single life, and that life is wounded without exception. *Juan* means to discard. *Cao* means to hold. *Zhao* is the target. *Zhangzhang* means bustling. Thus, the sage’s regulation of the myriad things is to preserve their Heaven. The sage restrains the myriad things, preventing them from harming his nature, thereby preserving his Heavenly truth. When Heaven is preserved, spirit is preserved.

The man of whole spirit requires no deliberation to penetrate all things, no scheming to act rightly. His essence illuminates all without, his will congeals within the cosmos, and his virtue descends like Heaven. Such a one may be the Son of Heaven yet remain unarrogant, or a common man yet remain untroubled—this is the man of whole Dao. The man of whole spirit is filled with wisdom and insight, his essence shining boundlessly, his will and qi congealing within the cosmos, his virtue of nurturing and sustaining equal to Heaven and Earth. Whether exalted as the Son of Heaven or lowly as a common man, he does not alter his resolve in response to poverty or prosperity.

A mind level and upright, unenticed by external things, is called *qing* (pure). Purity sustained becomes *ming* (lucidity). Lucidity sustained becomes *xu* (emptiness). In emptiness, the Dao is whole and dwells within.

When Qin Yi died, Kang Cangzi wept for him. Qin Yi was an ancient man of the Dao, a friend of Laozi. His disciple asked: "When all the world dies, Master, why do you weep?"—*Yi* refers to a disciple, one who serves. The way of life and death is constant across past and present. The enlightened comprehend this and do not weep—is that not so?

Kang Cangzi said: "When all the world weeps, how can I not weep? To weep in accord with things is to weep without truly weeping."

His disciple said: "Weeping must express sorrow, yet Master, you have not begun to grieve. Why?"

"Unbegun" means "never yet." The world’s weeping must arise from sorrow and pain—yet though you weep, Master, no grief appears. May I ask why?

Kang Cangzi said: When all under heaven shares no joy with me, where would I find sorrow? Joy and sorrow are the common lot of men. The enlightened see broadly—what distance lies between kin and stranger? Since I share no joy, I take no sorrow.

What falls away is called water; what falls away from water is called *qi*; what falls away from *qi* is called emptiness; what falls away from emptiness is called the Dao. "Falling away" means casting off. Casting off earth is water; casting off water is *qi*; casting off *qi* is emptiness; casting off emptiness is the Dao. Thus the perfected person, unbound by joy or sorrow, attains the ultimate.

Emptiness is the Dao’s body; stillness is the Dao’s ground; principle is the Dao’s warp; discernment is the Dao’s eye. To say the perfected person can be empty, still, discerning, and principled is to say they unite with the Dao’s form and grasp its warp and weft.

The Dao preserves spirit; virtue expands capacity; ritual orders conduct; things nourish the body. These four sustain life and cannot be briefly forsaken.

Those who favor white things deem black defiled; those who favor black things deem white defiled. How then can I know what under heaven is truly pure or defiled? Thus I do not fix upon purity or defilement.

The dim-sighted see yellow as red, blue as black—what I call black and white, how can the discerning not see as crimson and yellow? How then can I know what under heaven is the true color? Thus I do not flee from colors.

*Mao* means vertigo. *Tou* is yellow; *cheng* is red. Those with vertigo cannot see clearly, mistaking yellow for red and green for black—just as the common mind clings falsely to purity and defilement. Even a great sage cannot correct this, so I do not fix upon purity or defilement nor drift among colors.

Those who love wealth excessively see nothing else worth loving; those who love horses excessively see nothing else worth loving; those who love books excessively see nothing else worth loving. How then can I know what under heaven is truly lovable or detestable? Thus I do not see things as worthy of attachment, and nothing can disturb my constancy.

"Fruit" means determination; "preserve" means cherishing. Duke Huai of Chen sent his minister Dao to pay a visit to Lu. Huai was his posthumous name; Liu was his given name. Dao was the name of Chen’s minister.

Viscount Sun privately asked: The Viscount Sun clan had long served as ministers of Lu. Does our state have a sage? Do you know of him?

The sage referred to Confucius.

The minister of Chen asked: How can you be certain of his sagacity?

Viscount Sun said: He can set aside the mind and use the body.

The sagely realm transcends the ordinary—how can common sentiments fathom it? They see only his ability to handle worldly affairs and take that as proof of sagacity, yet how can they know his true sagacity?

The minister of Chen said: Our humble state is small, yet it too has a sage, different from what you have heard.

He asked: Who is this sage?

The minister of Chen said: There is one called Kang Cangzi, who partially attained the Dao of Lao Dan. Among his disciples, he is most renowned—hence "partially attained." He can use his ears to see and his eyes to hear.

Duke Ding heard this and found it strange. He sent the Viscount Sun clan to return the visit and invite Kang Cangzi, receiving him with the rites due an upper minister.

Kang Cangzi arrived and was lodged in the secondary hall. The Duke of Lu spoke humbly to inquire of him.

Kang Cangzi said: I can hear and see without using ears or eyes—it is not that I reverse their functions, as the messenger mistakenly reported.

The Duke said: How can this be? You increase my wonder. What is this Dao like? I truly wish to hear of it.

Kang Cangzi said: My body unites with mind, mind with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, spirit with nothingness. Though there is a boundary of being, a resonance of sound—whether distant beyond the eight wilds or near within the space between brows and lashes—whatever comes to me, I know it completely, yet do not know *how* I know it.

What my seven orifices and limbs perceive, what my six viscera, five organs, and heart-mind know—these I know of myself. When mind and form merge, spirit and *qi* mysteriously align, utterly forgotten, one with nothingness—then the mind grows ever stiller and wisdom ever more far-reaching, spirit ever more silent and illumination ever clearer. Principle reaches its limit and naturally flows; without thought, one gazes into the profound.

Who but the supremely sagely and spiritually attuned can attain this? This is indeed the pivotal essence of numinous reality, the wondrous Dao of profound mystery.

**Using the Dao, Second Chapter**

Nothing fails to benefit things; it accords with the heart of Heaven. Mastering oneself, one returns to benevolence; transformation spreads, and punishments are set aside.

Heaven cannot be trusted; falling cannot be trusted; men cannot be trusted; the heart cannot be trusted. Only the Dao can be trusted. How can worthy rulers and outstanding scholars know this?

Of old, Jie trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not cultivate the Dao, so Heaven took his state and granted it to Yin. Zhou likewise trusted Heaven and his ancestral dominion over the Four Seas, yet he did not personally practice the Dao, so Heaven took his state and granted it to Zhou.

"Granted" means "bestowed"; "ancestral" means "primary." The Xia tyrant Jie and the Yin tyrant Zhou indulged in excess and extravagance, claiming their mandate came from Heaven. Yet they acted with utter cruelty, neglecting the Dao, so Heaven took their states and bestowed them upon Tang and Wu.

Now, the slothful farmer trusts that falling seeds produce all grains, yet if he does not exert himself in the Dao, weeds will steal his harvest and leave it overgrown. The indolent farmer trusts that seeds produce grain but does not diligently weed or plow, so the fields become choked with weeds.

Thus he cannot reap his harvest.

The Lord of Qi trusted in human nature’s propensity for yielding and deference, yet he did not comprehend the Dao. He entrusted his entire realm to others, who in truth were like kites and jackals, seizing his state. *Lord* refers to the ruler, namely Duke Jian of Qi. Trusting in human nature’s lack of clarity in yielding and deference, he was assassinated by Chen Heng, who took his state. *Kites and jackals* is a metaphor for rapacity and cruelty.

Whenever one does not cultivate the Dao but follows the heart’s inclinations as a teacher, nurturing desires to flourish and multiply, calamities and illnesses arise in swarms, harming the body and shortening life—such is the heart’s harm to the self. When one takes the heart as teacher and does not follow sagely teachings, desires burn fiercely, and a hundred misfortunes gather. This is how the heart harms the body. *Swarms* means groups; *arise* means to stir; *harm* means to injure.

Thus it is said: only the Dao can be trusted. The Dao is vast, tranquil, and serene, unstained by attachment. If one empties the heart and returns to the Dao, body and life are preserved.

Heaven, without the Dao, cannot endure long; Heaven attains the One and becomes clear, Earth attains the One and becomes stable. The common people, without the worthy, cannot be pacified and obedient; governance, without talent, cannot be harmonized and ordered. When the worthy and talented are all employed, the Dao is used to order things.

Those who employ the Dao do not display their use of it; their blessings nourish the myriad things, yet they claim no merit. Their hidden merits and subtle aid allow the people to say, “We are naturally thus.” Their spirit flows and their deeds flourish, their numinous blessings enduring long. *Flows* means to circulate. When the workings of spirit are unimpeded and virtue’s deeds flourish, accumulated goodness gathers, and blessings flow to descendants.

To know and distinguish is called *discernment*; to know without distinguishing is called the *Dao*. Discernment is for governing people; the Dao is for pacifying them. Analyzing and distinguishing things guides people to abandon evil and embrace good—this is how one governs. Embracing vastness, dwelling in tranquility, refraining from praise or blame—this is how one pacifies and stills restless striving.

The rooster crows at dawn, toiling under the sun, sweat dripping to the ground, resting only at midnight—such is the farmer’s Dao. *Dawn* refers to the cock’s crow at daybreak; *midnight* is the middle of the night; *toiling under the sun* means exposed to the sun’s heat; *only* means barely.

Bending to gather, reaching to take, sharpening the mind like an awl, straining thought to concentrate, seeking profit and gain—such is the merchant’s Dao.

Swallowing qi and nurturing spirit, cutting off thoughts and reducing cares, transcending and ascending lightly, refining the essence of the sun to attain immortality—such is the noble adept’s Dao. *Swallowing qi* refers to embryonic breathing and the Five Sprouts; *nurturing* means to cultivate; *cutting off* means to sever; *essence of the sun* means absorbing solar essence; *refining immortality* means refining one’s substance until ascent to immortality is achieved.

Directing emotions and focusing thoughts, dedicating oneself wholly to one’s duties, deliberating with such devotion that sleep is forgotten, planning to fulfill one’s office—such is the minister’s Dao. Concentrating emotions and rectifying thoughts, devoting loyalty to the ruler one serves; guiding governance and measuring affairs to render service in one’s office—this is the minister’s Dao.

Purifying the heart and reducing thoughts, examining and verifying close attendants, striving to seek worthy talent to pacify the myriad people—such is the ruler’s Dao. *Purifying the heart* means diminishing desires; *reducing thoughts* means being selfless; *close attendants* refers to courtiers.

If each follows the order of their aspirations and measures, not obstructing their professional conduct, this is called *the world possessing the Dao*. Farmers and merchants each preserve their vocations; enlightened rulers and worthy ministers each cultivate their Dao—thus the world follows its order, and professional conduct is secure.

Guiding the sinews and bones preserves the form; pruning emotions and desires preserves the spirit; quieting speech preserves blessings. Mastering these three preservations is called *pure worthiness*.

When the Dao and virtue flourish, ghosts and spirits assist; when trust and integrity are sincere, the noble converge; when rites and propriety are complete, the petty submit.

Those with discernment are self-assured; those without discernment are also self-assured. Those with the Dao are silent and still; the dull and obtuse are also silent and still. Things inherently possess what seems right but is wrong, what seems wrong but is right. Some wail first and laugh later; some begin auspiciously and end in misfortune. Some bodies may be embraced, yet their talents cannot be; some talents may be revered, yet their bodies cannot be. Excessive reverence precludes intimacy; excessive intimacy precludes reverence. Embracing may lead to estrangement; estrangement may lead to embrace. Excessive favor breeds resentment; excessive love invites hatred.

Some value speed, some value slowness; some value straightness, some value curvature. The suitability of all affairs arises from the subtlest origins—one cannot be ignorant of them, which is why the wise find them difficult.

Stillness allows spirit to penetrate; adversity allows intent to penetrate; nobility allows speech to penetrate; wealth allows the body to penetrate—such is the nature of principle and circumstance. Some texts read: *such is the nature of principle, the force of circumstance.*

Those who share the Dao love one another; those who share chrysanthemums envy one another. Those who give love one another; those who take envy one another. Those who share suffering love one another; those who share strength envy one another—this is the natural human condition. When emotions connect without seeking, they love; when competing for ability and striving for superiority, they envy—such is the force of circumstance.

Talented yet fond of humility, poor and lowly yet not obsequious, enduring toil yet not deeming it disgrace, noble and wealthy yet increasingly reverent and diligent—this may be called one who possesses virtue.

**Section Three: The Dao of Governance**
Enforce the decrees of Heaven and act accordingly, without regard for near or far. Distant lands converge as one, submitting at the mere sight of virtue.

Men cannot fathom the cycles of Heaven’s four seasons—cold and heat, nor the movements of sun, moon, and stars. Yet if they knew the proper course of Heaven’s seasons—cold and heat, sun, moon, and stars—then all living creatures of blood and qi would find their place and rest secure in their procreation.

Ministers likewise cannot fathom where their lord’s rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments will fall. Yet if they knew where such bestowals were fitting, then the near and far, worthy and unworthy alike would exhaust their talents and strengths to be of use.

When trust is complete, the realm is at peace; when trust is lost, the realm is in peril. When the common people toil exhaustively and their resources are spent, contentious and harmful thoughts arise, and trust is broken. When men do not trust, it is because governance is unjust. When governance is unjust, it is the fault of the officials. When officials are at fault, it is because punishments and rewards are uneven. When punishments and rewards are uneven, it is because the lord is not diligent and enlightened. When the lord is diligent and enlightened, punishments and rewards are unified; when punishments and rewards are unified, officials uphold the law; when officials uphold the law, governance flows downward; when governance flows downward, the people find their place and mutual trust is restored. Thus we know that the loss of trust throughout the realm stems from the lord’s lack of diligence and enlightenment.

Kang Cangzi dwelled in Xirang for five years. (Xirang was a place name in Zhou.) King Ling dispatched Minister Ji to present a bamboo basket of silk and threaded jade. (King Ling was King Ling of Zhou; Minister Ji was a minister of Zhou. *Lu* was fine jade.) King Ling, admiring Kang Cangzi’s virtue, sent Minister Ji with gifts of jade and silk to summon him. (The *fei* was a basket for holding silk; *ren* was the cord used to string jade.) The king said: “I, a humble and unworthy youth, have disgraced the throne. Floods and droughts come unseasonably—how, as a mere man, may I avert them?”

King Ling said: “I, a shallow and unworthy youth, have failed in virtue and disgraced the royal seat, bringing untimely floods and droughts that cause the people to suffer hunger. I humbly ask for the method to dispel these calamities.”

Kang Cangzi replied: “Floods are the disorder of yin. In governance, yin corresponds to punishment; in human affairs, it corresponds to selfishness. (*Li* means disorder. Water is a yin image, and yin governs punishment. Water also resembles hidden, selfish currents.) If punishments are unjust and human affairs are rife with selfishness, then the disorder of floodwaters arises.

Drought is the excess of yang. In governance, yang corresponds to virtue; in human affairs, it corresponds to excess. (Drought is a yang image. Yang governs virtue. Yang also resembles ostentation, arrogance, and excess.) If the lord does not cultivate virtue and human affairs are marked by extravagance, then the calamity of great drought arises.”

Chu (Kang Cangzi’s given name) concluded: “Whenever floods or droughts occur, the Son of Heaven should rectify punishments and cultivate virtue, while all officials should eliminate selfishness and guard against excess. Thus, by correspondence, the calamities will dissipate, and a hundred blessings will arrive.” (All subsequent references follow this pattern.)

In Zheng, there were the Hu jade tablet and the Rong bow. Hu was the name of a state. *Feng gui* refers to a large jade tablet, while *Rong gong* refers to a type of bow. These two objects originally belonged to the state of Hu and were later obtained by Zheng. At another time, Zheng failed to attend the *tong* assembly with Jing. *Yishi* means "at another time." The feudal lords’ formal audience with the overlord was called *tong*. Jing was the former name of Chu. At that time, Chu was powerful, and the feudal lords gathered to pay court to it during the scheduled assembly. Zheng arrived late, so Jing said, “You must hand over the *feng gui* and *Rong gong*; otherwise, we will bring our troops against you.” Relying on its strength, Jing acted unjustly, using Zheng’s tardiness as a pretext to coerce and extort the two treasures.

The lord of Zheng was troubled by this. He drove his carriage to see Kang Cangzi and said, “The *feng gui* and *Rong gong* were obtained from Hu by our former lord, passed down through generations as tokens of merit and virtue to be cherished by our descendants. Now Jing, relying on its size, demands them, threatening military action if we refuse. Our state will be in peril. I wish to send other jade tablets and bows in their place—what do you think?” *Other jade tablets* refers to different jade tablets.

Kang Cangzi replied, “My lord, put your mind at ease for now. Even Jing possesses treasures of its own. I shall adorn Jing’s treasure to absolve you of blame—though Jing itself cannot do this. *Shi* means ‘to defer.’ To deceive a great state with counterfeit jades is to tarnish our integrity with falsehood. Though the blame may be postponed, it will ultimately lead to punishment. You must present the genuine articles.” He urged the lord of Zheng not to send substitutes.

“Now Jing, over a trivial offense, wields its might and punishment, indulging in unjust aggression to plunder and weaken its allies. Jing will lose the allegiance of the feudal lords. When the lords hear of this, they will take warning, strengthen their defenses, and unite in righteous assembly, with Zheng at the forefront. My lord, wait patiently—could this not be a blessing in disguise?” *Qian* suggests insignificance; *fu* means “to rely on”; *cheng* means “to indulge”; *lunbi* means “peers” or “equals”; *gu* means “for now.”

Zheng’s tardiness was indeed a minor fault, but Jing, relying on its strength, sought to impose its will and punishments, coercing the surrender of the jade and bow while encroaching upon its allies. Such greed and lack of virtue would surely cost it the allegiance of the feudal lords.

Thus, Zheng sent the Hu jade tablet and Rong bow. Before they reached Ying (the capital of Jing), the people of Jing heard of it—likely of Kang Cangzi’s counsel. They said, “They follow the words of a sage. How can we accept these gifts, exposing our injustice to the world and giving the feudal lords cause to resent us?” They promptly returned the gifts and treated Zheng with even greater favor.

Human nature desires life and fears death, seeks security and shuns peril, craves honor and avoids disgrace. When people attain their desires, they are joyful and at peace; when they do not, they suffer and face danger. If a ruler indulges his desires, then all officials and administrators will likewise pursue theirs. *Fang* means “to indulge.” *Baili* refers to all officials; *shu guo* refers to the heads of various affairs. *Zhan* means “to extend.” If officials and administrators all pursue their desires, then the people of the realm—whether poor or wealthy—will exhaust their strength or their wealth. The four classes (scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants) will lose their proper order, and none will attain their desires.

When the people of the realm cannot attain their desires, they will band together, clinging to one another, fleeing and hiding, drifting like floating weeds, gathering wild fruits to sustain their lives. *Jun* means “to gather”; *cai* means “to collect.” They will forage for wild fruits to preserve their lives. If officials then pursue and capture them, they will be overwhelmed by hardship and danger, and thoughts of rebellion will arise. If such rebellious thoughts spread, the state will no longer be the ruler’s own.

Do not covet population growth, for the people will flee from you. Do not fortify your cities excessively, for the people will be exhausted. If taxes are not moderate, the poor will grow poorer. If punishments are inconsistent, the powerful will grow more powerful. If laws and prohibitions are not enforced, the state will collapse. *Zhong* means “balanced.” If officials are unworthy, then leniency and severity will be misapplied. Some may even compete with the people for profit, breeding cunning and deceit, making the people treacherous and difficult to govern.

When the people are difficult to govern, the ruler becomes suspicious. When the ruler is suspicious, the people grow more confused. When the people are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to deter. The state becomes easily agitated and difficult to pacify—all because the right people are not in office.

The essence of governance lies in carefully selecting officials. *Li* means “to be diligent.” If a scholar’s talent and conduct are esteemed by his village, entrust him with village affairs. If his talent and conduct are esteemed by his county, entrust him with county affairs. If his talent and conduct are esteemed by his province, entrust him with provincial affairs. If his talent and conduct are esteemed by the state, entrust him with state affairs. Only then will there be no hidden talents left unutilized.

If someone commits a transgression in the village, admonish them. *Li* means “offense.” If they do not reform, send them to the county for punishment. If they still do not reform, send them to the province for exile. If they persist in their transgressions, execute them.

And only then can there be no rebellious conduct.

If this is truly so, every person under heaven will harbor no seeds of disobedience, resentment, indolence, or arrogance in their hearts—this is called *jingren* (the settled people). When worthy talents are employed and the violent and wicked turn toward goodness, the people of the world will be at peace.

Of all the affairs of the world, none is greater than seeking out scholars. Of all the ways scholars await being sought, none is better than *tongzheng* (open governance). And of all the virtues of open governance, none surpasses *jingren*. When the ruler is enlightened by sagely teachings, scholars will flock to him. When many worthies govern together, nothing is better than *jingren*.

The talents of *jingren*, however, are scarcely found among those judged by literary composition—perhaps only four or five in a hundred. For literary compositions are often florid and deceitful, lacking substance. If one were to rigorously assess the talents of *jingren* by their writings, not even four or five in a hundred would meet the mark.

If judged by their speech, perhaps one or two in ten might suffice. For those who speak well may not possess virtue, and those who possess virtue may not speak well—thus, only one or two in ten may prove true.

But if judged by their *qi* and settled demeanor, eight or nine in ten will be genuine. The worthy and good have broad minds and relaxed bodies; their *qi* is harmonious and unhurried. Their movements and bearing invariably align with propriety. By carefully observing these signs, one may identify eight or nine out of ten.

All this depends on the discernment and judgment of a sagacious king in a prosperous age. Even if worthy talents exist externally, without a ruler’s clear discernment, they cannot be properly selected.

In a declining age, if rulers select scholars by literary composition, cunning and extravagance will flourish, while refined and sincere voices will retreat. When florid writing is prized in a degenerate era, those of true simplicity will not come forward.

If scholars are chosen by their speech, glib and ostentatious men will thrive, while forthright and loyal remonstrators will fade into obscurity. When those who flaunt their eloquence are esteemed, the candid and upright will withdraw.

If scholars are selected by their *qi* and settled demeanor, those who appear upright but harbor wickedness will be exalted, while those of pure cultivation and true substance will remain hidden. This occurs when rulers lack discernment and fail to choose the right people.

In such cases, the more "worthies" are appointed, the more governance strays; the more decrees are issued, the more the people descend into chaos. To mistake the unworthy for the worthy is to invite greater disorder.

The world is the greatest of vessels; the throne of the emperor is the weightiest of positions. With the right scholars, there is peace; without them, there is chaos. The ruler labors in seeking the worthy but finds ease in employing them.

Alas! He who guards heaven’s mandate and gathers the people—how can he not devote himself sincerely to scholars?

When human affairs go awry, nothing concerns the ruler more deeply than the miscarriage of justice. Of all such failures, none is more grievous than errors in punishment.

A ruler of enlightened talent, when adjudicating disputes, may employ deception to coax the truth, or intimidation to compel it, or empathy to draw it out, or punishment to force it. Though his methods may vary, he must always ensure fairness. Even a single misjudgment weighs heavily on a wise ruler—how much more so the grave matter of criminal trials?

In examining cases and interrogating prisoners, the utmost effort must be made to uncover the truth. If a prisoner conceals the facts, the ruler may employ threats to compel them; or guide them with reason; or, if necessary, resort to punishment. Though his tactics may be manifold, he must never allow injustice or excess.

Thus, the people of the world will have no cause for gratitude in life or resentment in death. If a man’s life is rightfully spared, he owes no debt of gratitude; if his death is rightfully decreed, he bears no grievance.

A ruler who governs the state, appoints officials, and administers justice in this manner may be called *zhiguan* (the perfect office). In an age of perfect governance, the people’s hearts are harmonious and upright; all livelihoods are fitting; love and respect run deep; superiors and inferiors are firmly aligned, unshakable as a single family. How could any disobedience or rebellion arise?

When King Ping restored order and settled in the capital, he devoted himself to seeking worthy talents. Upon hearing even a single good report, his joy would last for days.

King Ping succeeded the chaotic reigns of Kings You and Li, when the world was in turmoil and all discipline had collapsed. He then quelled the disorder, moved the capital east to Luoyi, corrected past wrongs, and diligently sought wise men. Upon hearing even one commendable deed, his delight would endure for days.

*Resided* refers to dwelling; *heavenly capital* refers to Luoyi. *Attained* means *obtained*.

His attendants repeatedly praised certain great ministers as exceptionally worthy, and this continued for over a year. These attendants were minor officials at his side, who, seeing the king’s pleasure, flattered him to curry favor.

The king said: "I, alone, am not enlightened in virtue. I strive to seek out the worthy, yet I fear that those hidden in mountains and marshes may go unrecognized. How could I take pleasure in hearing good reports only to shut myself off from them?

Formerly, my fawning and obsequious servants repeatedly extolled those in power, gradually gaining influence at my side. My own weakness and dullness left me unable to discern clearly, so I merely echoed their harmonious words, allowing their influence to grow unchecked.

No greater harm to virtue comes from the failure to correct such errors in time, allowing cliques to form and solidify."

"Oblique flattery" refers to perverse flattery. "Those in power" are the great ministers. "To ascend" means to rise. "Weak" means feeble. "Dependence" means mutual reliance. Perverse and flattering minor officials extolled those in power, climbing by clinging to the king’s attendants, jointly concealing the truth, claiming that I was dim-witted and weak, unable to discern clearly. If not suppressed in time, factionalism would deepen and solidify.

Thereupon, he cast out three of his closest attendants to the marketplace—meaning he executed them and exposed their corpses in public. In ancient times, criminals were punished in the marketplace, where all could witness their rejection. He demoted five of the chief ministers of the various offices—these were the powerful great ministers—saying: "Let no minister who serves his lord attach himself to inferiors to deceive his superiors, nor cling to his salary while flattering to curry favor."

When the realm heard of this, they called him enlightened and discerning. Seven states west of the Southern Sea submitted in allegiance.

In an age of perfect governance, carriages and robes were plain and unadorned, laws and decrees were lenient and simple, and prohibitions were sparse and broad. When carriages and robes were plain, people did not covet excess; without mutual envy, desires waned. When laws and decrees were lenient and simple, customs knew no taboos; when prohibitions were sparse and broad, transgressions were easy to avoid yet hard to commit. If people did not covet excess, their cravings diminished, and they willingly followed their labors with joy. If customs knew no taboos, repression dissolved, and hearts opened in glad exchange. If transgressions were easy to avoid yet hard to commit, good and evil became distinct, and people valued virtue and knew shame. To value virtue is to refrain from wrongdoing; to know shame is to avoid it easily.

To willingly follow one’s labors with joy is called *obedience*; to open in glad exchange is called *harmony*; to value virtue and know shame is called *rectitude*. The indolent cannot overcome *obedience*; the rebellious cannot overcome *harmony*; the wicked cannot overcome *rectitude*. *Obedience*, *harmony*, and *rectitude*—these three are the foundation of governing a state.

In an age of decline, carriages and robes were ornate and cunning, laws and decrees were superstitious and excessive—*superstitious excess* meaning overabundance—and prohibitions were biased and perverse. When carriages and robes were ornate and cunning, people followed the current in mutual envy, as flames rise in emulation. When laws and decrees were superstitious and excessive, customs brimmed with taboos; when prohibitions were biased and perverse, none knew where to flee. If people followed the current in mutual envy, they became disloyal and impure, scorning simplicity and prizing ostentation. If customs brimmed with taboos, emotions and intentions were stifled, and superiors and inferiors clashed in discord. If none knew where to flee, slander and calamity multiplied, and the people feared not death.

To scorn simplicity and prize ostentation is called *frivolity*; for superiors and inferiors to clash in discord is called *strife*; for the people to fear not death is called *recklessness*. The truly upright cannot serve in *frivolity*; the just and impartial cannot serve in *strife*; the capable and talented cannot serve in *recklessness*. *Frivolity*, *strife*, and *recklessness*—these three are the ladders to a state’s ruin.

King Xiong Yu of Jing inquired about floods, droughts, order, and chaos. *Xiong* was the surname of Jing, and *Yu* his given name. Master Kang Cang replied: "Floods and droughts come from Heaven; order and chaos arise from man. If human affairs are harmonious and well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot bring harm—such were the cases of Yao and Tang. In Yao’s time, there were nine years of floods; in Tang’s time, seven years of drought. Thus, the *Zhi Guan* of Zhou states: 'Man’s strength overcomes Heaven.' *Zhi Guan* is a chapter of the *Book of Zhou*. If human affairs are corrupt and chaotic, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble and collapse—how were Jie and Zhou destroyed by floods and droughts alone? One version reads: 'How were they destroyed *because of* floods and droughts?' The rulers Jie and Zhou perished through cruelty, extravagance, and debauchery—not merely from floods and droughts."

The lord of Jing faced north, followed in reverence, and bowed deeply, saying: "Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, allowing me to hear these words." One version reads: "followed and cultivated." *Followed in reverence* means to retreat in deference. The lord of Jing held Master Kang Cang in such esteem that he called him "Heaven." *This unworthy one* is a humble term used by kings and dukes. That Master Kang Cang did not abandon me is why I have been able to hear these words.

Thereupon, he presented ten pairs of great jade discs as a gift to Master Kang Cang and appointed him as Vice Minister. *Great jade discs* refers to large jades. *Ten pairs* means ten sets. *Vice Minister* is a lesser ministerial rank. He said:

"Might my state yet recover?" Master Kang Cang, unable to bear this, departed in the dead of night in plain clothes for another land. *Recover* means to improve. *Departed* means to leave.

In an age of perfect governance, mountains harbor no false recluses, markets yield no illicit profits, and courts grant no sycophantic stipends.

Guo Chan asked: "How might one restore the people’s customs to purity and simplicity?" *Guo Chan* was the courtesy name of Gongsun Qiao, a grandee of Zheng.

Master Kang Cang replied: "When governance is oppressive and laws proliferate, the people grow cunning and deceitful. The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arise. When governance is streamlined and unified, the people return to purity and simplicity. *When its governance is carefree, its people are unsullied.* The customs of the people follow the shape of state policy as the inchworm conforms to the leaf—feeding on green, its body turns green; feeding on yellow, its body turns yellow."

He asked: "What must be done to enrich the people?"

Master Kang Cang replied: "When taxes are levied in due season and officials are pure and frugal, the people grow rich. When taxes are unchecked and officials are extravagant and indulgent, the people grow poor."

The arrows of Gou Yue are tipped with refined gold, fletched with the feathers of startled falcons. Yet when used for beating, they differ not from withered wood. *Gou Yue* refers to Eastern Yue. *Arrows* here means arrow shafts. *Startled falcons* are akin to eagles and ospreys. *Beating* means striking. The *Erya* states: "Among the finest things of the southeast are the bamboo arrows of Kuaiji." Though the arrows of Gou Yue are tipped with refined gold and fletched with falcon feathers, when used for striking, they are no different from withered wood.

Yet when deployed in repelling bandits and contending for victory, when fitted to a mighty crossbow, they leave no foe standing beyond three hundred paces. *Repelling bandits and contending for victory* means to engage in decisive combat. When such arrows are mounted on a powerful crossbow, none can withstand them.

The sword Fei Jing dazzles the white sun with its radiance, its qi surging like purple rainbows. Yet when used for reaping, it differs not from a sickle blade. *Fei Jing* is a divine sword. *Sickle blade* here means a reaping tool. Though the divine sword is keen, when used to harvest rice, it is no different from a sickle.

Yet when malevolent qi and seething toxins roil unchecked, when wielded in the palm, its might courses unobstructed for a thousand li. *Malevolent qi and seething toxins* refer to pestilential vapors. This divine sword dispels such malevolence, so that wherever its awe-inspiring light reaches, none within a thousand li may tarry.

Each material has its proper place, and each use its fitting application. What matters is to employ them aptly according to the times. Withered wood and sickle blades suffice for common tasks, while the arrows of Yue and the sword Fei Jing are for warding off calamities. Each material has its proper use, valued according to the needs of the time.

In ancient times, the Radiant August Thearch governed the realm in peace, all things flourished, and all beings attained their full potential—this was because he followed the times without disturbance.

In recent ages, the realm has grown rife with deceit and treachery, while the upright are few. The frivolous and profit-seeking abound, while the steadfast and retiring are rare. The wicked outshout the loyal, their cunning and falsehood sowing confusion, leaving none able to discern the truth. Thus the people of the realm come to harm one another.

Alas! In crafting laws, what is prized is that they be easy to avoid yet hard to violate. In remedying abuses, what is prized is that measures be simple and decrees unified. Eliminate the overbearing, and officials will be at ease. Enforce punishments and prohibitions without fail, and officials will not dare pursue private gain. When officials do not pursue private gain, the people grow rich.

The *Records of Punishment* state: "Calamities and disasters call for amnesties, but amnesties should not be frequent. Frequent amnesties embolden the wicked, while the common people grow restive. When the wicked are emboldened, they redouble their villainy; when the common people grow restive, they too turn to wrongdoing. Thus the worthy and good are stifled."

When one commits great harm, and the officials apprehend them, they may cast a wide net, falsely implicating the innocent, dragging in distant connections, hoping to stretch out the proceedings until an amnesty is declared. The victims of such harm find no satisfaction, only self-inflicted torment. As a result, the common people devise ever more cunning schemes, officials toil under harsh governance, and none can quell the chaos—all due to the excess of amnesties.

People refrain from wickedness and injustice because of punishment, and are encouraged toward virtue and right conduct because of rewards. Now, if the wicked and unjust are pardoned, while the virtuous and upright are harmed and go unrewarded, is it not difficult to expect people to embrace goodness?

If there were a worthy ruler or discerning scholar who would heed this discourse:

*Finally* means to reach an end. *Satisfaction* means joy. *Torment* means suffering. *Heed* means to accept.

The resentment of the people does not stem from failing to engage with them; the wrath of the spirits does not stem from failing to serve them. The more cunning and flattery abound, the more the people resent; the more excessive the sacrifices, the more the spirits rage.

**Scroll on the Way of the Ruler, Chapter Four**

To govern with clarity and non-action, leading by personal example.

That which gives life is Heaven; that which nurtures and completes it is man. All things owe their beginning to Heaven; to assist Heaven in nurturing them is the role of man. One who can nurture what Heaven has brought forth without disturbing the things of the world is called the Son of Heaven. *Disturb* means to agitate. When man aids Heaven in nurturing things and they become docile, he who governs them is called the Son of Heaven.

In ancient times, Shun possessed sagely virtue, and wherever he moved, a capital flourished. The movements of the Son of Heaven serve to preserve the *qi* of Heaven—this is the principle by which offices are established. Offices are established to preserve life. Heaven does not govern directly, so the sage acts on Heaven’s behalf to order all things. The sage cannot govern alone, so he establishes offices to assist him. The purpose of establishing offices is fundamentally to nurture all things, valuing the preservation of Heaven’s *qi* and preventing harm or depletion.

Yet the deluded rulers of this age multiply offices only to harm life, losing sight of the original purpose of their establishment. Later generations of misguided rulers focus on increasing offices, but more offices lead to more policies, and more policies harm the people—this betrays the original intent of establishing offices.

When grasses are stifled, they rot; when trees are stifled, they become infested; when men are stifled, they fall ill; when a state is stifled, a hundred evils arise, and chaos becomes uncontrollable. *Stifled* means the *qi* is obstructed. When offices multiply and policies proliferate, affairs become congested, like grasses and trees succumbing to rot and infestation.

The so-called stifling of the state occurs when the ruler’s virtue fails to spread downward and the people’s desires fail to reach upward. Wicked ministers block the way, so the ruler’s virtue does not descend; the common folk are oppressed, so their desires do not ascend. Therefore, sagely kings value loyal ministers and upright scholars, for they dare to speak frankly and dispel obstructions.

By restraining oneself and returning to ritual, the worthy and good will come of their own accord. *Restrain* means to diminish; *return* means to revert. If the ruler can humble himself and return to ritual, the worthy and good will gather to him. When the ruler plows and the empress tends silkworms, the common people will naturally be transformed. When the Son of Heaven personally plows and the Empress personally tends silkworms, leading by example, the world follows their model.

Thus, the worthy and upright may be awaited but not sought—those obtained by seeking are not truly worthy. When the ruler embodies ritual and deference, worthy ministers will come of their own accord, so they may be awaited. If the ruler lacks ritual and deference, even if he seeks the worthy, those who come will not be truly worthy.

The common people may be transformed but not punished—punishment that is applied is not in accord with principle. When the ruler plows and the empress tends silkworms, the people will emulate them, so they may be transformed. If one does not act oneself but compels others to act, they will not obey.

Though...

even if punishment is repeatedly applied, such punishment does not accord with the highest principle.

Yao and Shun labored as rulers for the people, yet harbored no desires as rulers for themselves—thus the world each attained fulfillment of its desires. "Labor" refers to toiling with the mind to nurture all things; "desire" refers to serving the self to gratify one’s own wishes. They held the position of ruler but not the mind of one—thus the world each could freely follow its heart. "Position" means occupying office to govern affairs; "mind" means seeking ease for one’s own comfort. "Freely" means to extend.

There are those loved by the whole world yet not loved by their lord, and those loved solely by their lord yet not loved by the world. Those who exhaust their public loyalty to nourish the world are loved by the world; those who indulge private favor to curry favor with one person are loved by their lord. When one employs those loved by the world, the world is at peace; when one employs those loved only by their lord, the world is in peril. How can a ruler afford to indulge his own loves and hates? Therefore, one who values the world’s love must restrain his emotions. The sage takes the world’s peace or peril as his own concern. If he desires the world’s peace, the ruler must not indulge his loves and hates but must suppress his private inclinations.

What is called "the world" refers to its possession of the myriad things; what is called "the state" refers to its possession of the multitude of people. The state takes the people as its foundation—when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Thus, a ruler who worries for the state must seek those capable of governing the people. The world is rich in the myriad things, the state is rich in its multitude of people—one who worries for the state and nation cannot but employ the worthy to assist him.

The reason jade is difficult to discern is that there exists *keng*-stone; the reason gold is difficult to discern is that there exists *tou*-stone. *Keng*-stone resembles jade, *tou*-stone resembles gold—just as the treacherous appear upright externally yet are inwardly perverse, they too are difficult to discern.

Now, if one covers a sparrow with the wings of a falcon, those with dim vision will mistake it for a falcon; only the clear-sighted will see that it is a sparrow. The falcon is the hawk; the sparrow is the finch. Now, petty men often recite the classics and medical texts, or study arcane arts and eclectic doctrines, and are clad in blue and purple robes of office. The foolish, hearing and seeing them, take them for true gentlemen; only the discerning, hearing and seeing them, recognize them as petty men. "Arcane arts" refers to unusual skills; "eclectic doctrines" refers to miscellaneous teachings.

Thus, when a ruler is truly enlightened, he selects men by their words, by their talents, and by their conduct—all in accord with principle. When a ruler is benighted, he selects men by their words, by their talents, and by their conduct—all leading to disorder. The enlightened ruler, in selecting men by their words and conduct, ensures all is in accord with principle; the dull ruler, though selecting men by their words and conduct, ensures all is in disorder.

When the sage ruler employs men, he values achievements unseen by the ear, unseen by the eye, and inexpressible in words—yet the people flourish and govern themselves. When the worthy govern the world, they do not display their names, nor make manifest their use, nor proclaim their abilities. Their merit works in secret, their governance flows smoothly and mysteriously, no trace of fame arises, and none vie for eminence—thus the sage ruler esteems them.

If a ruler values achievements heard by the ear, the people of the world will traffic in goods to chase profit and peddle reputation. If a ruler values the achievements he hears of from his ministers, the treacherous will deploy their wealth and resources, chasing every advantage to market their reputations. If a ruler values achievements seen by the eye, the people of the world will exaggerate their forms and flaunt their arts to compete for advancement—boasting and vying for notice, they will only bring greater disorder to the world. If a ruler values achievements that can be spoken of, the people of the world will cultivate glib tongues and adorn their words. With eloquent speech and facile arguments, empty yet insubstantial, they will vie for reputation and advancement, embellishing their words to gain access—thus the government will fail. When competition for fame and esteem for ability prevail, the way of proper principle declines.

A ruler knows that a mirror clarifies his appearance yet resents the gentleman who clarifies his faults. The mirror’s service is small, the gentleman’s service is great—knowing the small yet losing the great, he fails to grasp the likeness. The mirror reveals the beauty or ugliness of form; the gentleman reveals the goodness or evil of the heart. Correcting form is a small service; correcting the heart is a great one. Yet now the ruler esteems the small and loses the great—how can he not be deluded?

Alas! If the ruler purifies his heart and reduces his affairs, and his ministers are reverent, frugal, and steadfast in their duties, great peace will swiftly arrive. Yet the world sometimes finds this difficult—how can I fathom why?

If the ruler’s heart, the seat of his judgment, is unclear and indecisive, then the harmony of heaven and earth, all within the four seas, the moving and the rooted, the myriad kinds—all will lose their proper way. "The seat of judgment" refers to where the heart resides. "Moving" refers to those endowed with *qi*; "rooted" refers to the grasses and trees.

When a ruler selects men by what he hears and sees, offices multiply and governance falls into disorder—for those who embellish falsehoods abound, and those who vie for advancement are many. The ruler cannot discern them, thus offices multiply and governance falls into disorder. When a ruler selects men by careful reflection, offices are few and governance is clear—for those employed with sincere intent and keen perception are few, and their governance is well-ordered.

Thus, in an age that follows principle, one must seek talents unseen and unheard; in an age of peril and decline, one must select talents seen and heard. Alas! Does the ruler truly understand?

When a ruler selects men by what he hears and sees, people all flatter and deceive to buy reputation; when a ruler selects men by careful reflection, people all remain composed and upright, diligent in virtue. When officials are composed, upright, and diligent in virtue, transformation occurs without words; when officials flatter and deceive to buy reputation, punishment fails to inspire awe—does the ruler of this age truly understand?

**Chapter Five: The Way of the Minister**
Devote oneself wholly, exert all strength, and strive to fulfill one’s duties.

When a state is about to rise, among the hundred officials of the court, some are short, some tall, some plain, some comely, some gentle, some stern, some right, some wrong...

Ugly means repulsive. Gentle means pleasing. Stern means severe. Though their words may be heard and their appearances observed—seeming at first unlike—yet when their aspirations are examined and their hearts tested, all are devoted to serving the state. Thus, they neither resent forthright admonition nor startle at demotion; their counsel strikes the mean and never deviates from principle. Therefore, Heaven does not confuse its seasons, Earth does not withhold its bounty, men do not disrupt their proper roles, spirits and gods lend their aid, and distant barbarians submit in harmony. All things transform and flourish, and the Great Harmony is preserved.

When a state is rising, the court’s ranks and offices are filled by those who exhaust their loyalty, each giving their utmost ability, acting with impartial justice, and harboring no favoritism. Thus, Heaven’s seasons do not err, Earth’s resources do not fail, human affairs do not fall into disorder, spirits and gods grant their protection, and distant lands submit in compliance.

When a state is nearing ruin, the court’s hundred officials present fine appearances, their complexions harmonious, their words and tones refined and soft, their movements graceful and polished. Though the ministers of a doomed state appear outwardly compliant and agreeable, inwardly they harbor suspicion and envy, each pursuing private ends and secretly plotting harm. Though their appearances may be observed and their words heard—seeming at first cordial—yet when their aspirations are examined and their hearts tested, all are consumed by rivalry for position. Thus, they marvel at the unusual, startle at the unexpected, and in their mutual jealousy and deception, they lose the Way. Therefore, Heaven sends forth disasters in untimely seasons, Earth produces monstrous things—Heaven’s untimely seasons become calamities, Earth’s monstrous things become portents. Men commit wicked deeds, spirits and gods lie in wait to bring misfortune, border tribes invade in succession, and chaos and ruin abound. All things fail to transform.

Those who do not waste resources, do not exhaust the people’s strength, and do not harm officials, yet achieve success and establish good governance, enriching the people below and enhancing the ruler’s virtue above—such are the loyal and worthy ministers. Those who squander wealth, harass the people, endanger officials for fleeting results, seeking only immediate rewards from the ruler while ignoring the disasters they leave for the state—such are the treacherous ministers.

In a well-governed age, offices are filled by the right men. In a disordered age, men seize offices for themselves.

When Zhu Longti asked about serving a ruler, Kang Cangzi replied: “Once you inscribe your name as a subject, let your heart be nothing if not impartial, harboring no favoritism. Let your appearance be nothing if not harmonious, your words nothing if not upright. Impartiality should not seek to be clever, harmony should not be adulterated, and uprightness should not offend. Even if the ruler does not perceive it, one should not offend his countenance by remonstrating.”

The ancients practiced diligence and frugality to govern the state; today, men practice diligence and frugality to cultivate their reputations. Those who govern the state arrange matters with clarity, act appropriately, and align with the greater good. Those who cultivate their reputations arrange matters with clarity but fail to reach distant goals, constrained by petty concerns.

Thus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, it touches matters and finds their proper place; when the heart takes matters as its master, it touches things and loses their proper place. Taking the Dao as master is impartiality; taking matters as master is self-interest. *Di* means to touch.

Ministers in high positions who do not admonish, and those in low positions who are not impartial, do not deserve their emoluments. *Shan* means to provide. If the ruler is not solemn and respectful, if high ministers do not display trustworthiness to their subordinates, then ministers do not rightfully hold office in the court.

The talented are not necessarily loyal, and the loyal are not necessarily talented. Ministers need not fear disloyalty; they need only fear that, though loyal, the ruler may not trust them. The ruler need not fear distrust; he need only fear that, though trusting, he may not employ them effectively. *Shishi* means to put into practice.

The highest type of person, when their nature is realized, brings order to the world. The middling type, when their nature is realized, brings chaos to the world. A wise ruler employs the highest type, entrusting them with discretionary power and allowing them to act freely. The highest type—meaning the worthy and good, who are impartial and upright, harboring no favoritism—when placed in office, can be trusted to assist and correct. Though they may exercise flexibility at times, they always return to the upright.

When employing the middling type, one must set standards for their achievements and make clear the rewards and punishments. The middling type—meaning those with skills and abilities—improve when they see good and are corrupted when they see evil. Thus, the ruler controls them with rewards and punishments.

**Chapter Six: The Way of the Worthy**
Master oneself and return to ritual, and the worthy will come of their own accord.

The worthy are often sought but rarely arrive, difficult to advance yet easy to retreat—not because they cherish their lives and refuse to die for the ruler’s cause, but because they fear that, though loyal, the ruler may not trust them.

Those who know themselves to be capable and discerning are outwardly respectful yet inwardly free of worry. Among the multitude, they are harmonious and upright without being overly familiar. Draw near to them, and they become all the more dignified; distance yourself, and they withdraw without resentment. In adversity, they console themselves with fate; in prosperity, they rectify themselves with the Dao.

Some appear worthy in their bearing, others in their voice, but when their spirit is tested and their knowledge examined, they may fall short of expectations. When the worthy are employed, they enter court to gently admonish and praise, and withdraw to observe silence. They diligently attend to their duties, living simply and prudently. *Feng* means to subtly criticize the ruler’s faults; *yu* means to praise the ruler’s virtues. *Gongmo* means quiet and cautious. *Ban* means to manage; *xian* means to guard.

When not employed, they conceal themselves among the crowd, hide their knowledge from sight, and restrain their words. They eat their fill, walk at ease, cultivate their own integrity, and remain steadfast without resentment.

The wise do not doubt their roles, and the discerning do not doubt others. The perceptive, though their conduct may be perilous, maintain an unalterable demeanor; though their words may be modest, their principles remain unshakable. This means that in a corrupt age, they do not change their aspirations: though their conduct may be perilous, their countenance remains composed; though their words may be modest, their principles stand firm.

The worthy do not proclaim their own worth. Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; thus, they are not worthy. Their effectiveness is seen in governance, their merit in action. Examine their governance, observe their actions, and the worthy and the unworthy can be distinguished.

In times of Great Peace, the highest scholars apply their knowledge, the middling scholars exhaust their endurance, and the petty men contribute their strength.

In Qi there was a man named Pouzi, whose talents could have saved the state, whose conduct could have stood alone. *Zhen* means to rescue.

"To stand alone" means that one's virtue and conduct are so lofty and unshakable that none can topple them. In serving his parents, he is filial and reverent; among his village and kin, he is respectful and dutiful. Yet dwelling in poverty with nothing to provide for them, he has long wandered afar, upholding trust and righteousness. Wherever he goes, few find accord with him—sometimes mocked and deceived by those who flatter the times and fawn for advantage.

*Ru* means "to go." Originally written as *suo chi wang*. *Dai* is pronounced *dai*. Another version reads: "beginning from this." *Gua he shao xie* means "few harmonize, rare are those who coincide." *Kua pi* means "arrogant and obsequious." *Chi* means "to laugh." *Dai* means "to deceive."

Thereupon, leaning on his staff and dragging his feet, he went to inquire of Kang Cangzi: "I have heard that the perfected person forgets emotion—his empty mind merges with the Dao in unity, thus he forgets emotion. The common people do not employ emotion—being dull-witted and ignorant, they cannot apply it. Those who preserve emotion devote themselves to teaching and revere trust and righteousness. *Cao* means 'company.' The middling sort preserve emotion, holding trust and righteousness in highest esteem. Yet now I do not know what I am capable of. *Gong* means 'ability.' Though I personally practice trust and righteousness, wherever I go few find accord with me; I do not know what ability I possess.

Some accept what is untrustworthy as trust; some take trust that is not recognized as trust—though they are truly trustworthy, others do not see it, yet they still regard themselves as trustworthy. Some exert themselves in admiring righteousness and call it righteousness—though their actions are not righteous, they are praised as righteous by others. Some act righteously yet do not wait for others to call it righteous—they always regard themselves as righteous.

Thus, those who uphold trust and righteousness often meet with hardship and retreat. How can they gain esteem in their time, and how can teaching and principle rise above? Kang Cangzi stroked his lapel, composed his spirit, and sighed. Then, rising aloft, he sang:

When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish;
When the times are dark, trust and righteousness lie hidden.
Brightness and darkness, flourishing and concealment—
Why should I alone be troubled, swept along without preference?

*Gǔ* means "confused." *Qiang* is an exclamatory sound. *Du* means "to speak." The times know order and chaos, thus one's conduct knows action and concealment. When times are bright, one flourishes with them; when times are dark, one hides with them—following the current, moving with fate, how can there be partiality? Now you ask me, yet I do not know what you mean.

To move with one's true nature as if strolling freely—yet none respond—is to be truly unrecognized. When the true is unrecognized, it is called the loss of the Dao. Trust and righteousness are the function of true nature; the true is the root of true nature. When the Dao is lost, the highest scholars withdraw—withdrawal is righteous. There are times when action is possible, and times when it is not; there are times of prosperity and decline, none lasting forever. There are times when ability is employed, and times when it is not—employment knows action and concealment, none lasting forever.

The Duke of Zhai asked: "From where does one obtain worthy talent?"
Kang Cangzi replied: "The worthy and upright can be awaited but not sought; talent lies in seeking, but one must be cautious—without caution, there is no talent. If talent is sought but not chosen with care, there will be no talent. If the Son of Heaven is serene and his great ministers enlightened, if punishment does not spare the noble and favor does not bypass the lowly, then worthy men will come of their own accord seeking employment. When worthy men are employed, within the Four Seas all will see with clear eyes, hear with keen ears, and hold open hearts free of gloom. Heaven will perfect itself, Earth will settle itself, the myriad things will transform in purity, and even ghosts and spirits will be powerless to work wonders. When all under Heaven is pure and harmonious, ghosts and spirits cannot display strange marvels. Thus it is said: the worthy and upright can be awaited but not sought.

If the Son of Heaven is diligent and discerning, and his great ministers seek scholars with harmony and reason, then magnanimous, broad-minded, publicly upright, and steadfast talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is harsh and suspicious, and his great ministers seek scholars with impatience and haste, then cunning, artful, destructive, and way-breaking talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is doubtful and jealous, and his great ministers seek scholars with clever compliance, then talents of strange surnames and unusual names, with sidelong flattery and bizarre arts, will arrive. If the Son of Heaven esteems himself, and his great ministers cling to their positions while seeking scholars, then talents who chase reputation with embellishments, greedy and impure, will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is indecisive, and his great ministers seek scholars with devious flattery, then talents who appear loyal but are inwardly perverse, with venomous natures and gentle words, will arrive. Thus it is said: talent lies in seeking, but one must be cautious—without caution, there is no talent.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained Chang Xian, Feng Hong, and Rong Qiu—three ministers. The Shang king obtained Yi Yin; the Restoration king obtained Fu Shen—Fu being Zhongshan Fu, and Shen being Shen Bo. Duke Huan of Qi obtained Mi Ning Ji—this is Ning Qi. All these rulers embodied the Dao and surpassed in benevolence, widely displaying sagely martial virtue, seeking to gather brilliance, and governing with magnanimity, generosity, and uprightness. Thus, the multitude of worthies came of their own accord seeking employment—not obtained through meticulous selection. *Mai* means 'to practice.' *Ji* means 'harmony.' *Jian he* means 'to choose.'

The Duke of Zhai said: "Master, you say that worthy men do not seek but come of their own accord—are there also those who are not worthy yet come of their own accord without being sought?"
Kang Cangzi replied: "Those who are not worthy yet come of their own accord without being sought are indeed many. When the world has the Dao, worthy men do not seek but come of their own accord; when the world lacks the Dao, those who are not worthy do not seek but come of their own accord. Rulers with the Dao are few; those without it are many. Worthy men in the world are few; the unworthy are many. Thus, those who are not worthy yet come of their own accord without being sought are many."

The Duke of Zhai said: "The worthy surely save the world, and talent can also save the world—if both save the world, how do the worthy and the talented differ?"

Kang Cangzi replied: "How pressing is this question! Pressing—it is urgent. The inquiry is indeed pressing. Now, when merits are accomplished and affairs are completed, yet one does not seek titles or fame, but retreats with reverence, simplicity, and frugality—this is what we call *worthy*. To seek is to pursue. Having achieved merit, one does not occupy the position but nurtures oneself with reverent humility. When merits are accomplished and affairs are completed, yet glory lies in emoluments and reputation, and one’s aspirations are fully displayed—this is what we call *talent*. The worthy can *pacify* a state; talent can *govern* a state. What is meant by *pacifying*? It is harmony, tranquility, and non-action—people do not perceive its power. Supreme virtue transforms in hidden ways, and none can comprehend it. What is meant by *governing*? It is diligent execution of affairs, and people recognize the virtue therein. They rely on its merit, thus attributing virtue to oneself.

One worthy leading many talents is more than sufficient; many talents measuring themselves against one worthy still fall short—such is the vast difference between the worthy and talent. Though one worthy is few, leading many talents, their virtue still abounds; though many talents are numerous, compared to one worthy, they still cannot match. There are those who dwell in mountains and forests yet act with righteousness; there are those amidst worldly customs yet remain serene. There are those who are boisterous yet upright; there are those who are quiet yet perverse. This shows that in seeking the worthy, one must not fail to discern the upright from the perverse.

Generally, when observing one whose appearance is coarse and vulgar yet proves worthy, not one in ten thousand exists; when observing one whose appearance is refined and elegant yet is in truth a petty man, nine in ten are so. Thus, the worthy are hard to come by. One who, without refining their words, understands their pattern; without demanding their demeanor, examines their measure; without heeding their praise, knows their goodness; without being swayed by slander, judges their worth—such a one may be called discerning. Without waiting for rumors or defamation, they perceive the true nature of evil.

**Chapter Seven: The Instruction of the Dao**

The application of utmost virtue is the master of all teachings, praised by numinous spirits, and can transform the people.

Min Ziqian asked Confucius: "How far apart are the Dao and filial piety?"

He suspected they were distant from one another.

Confucius said: "The Dao is the wondrous function of spontaneity. Filial piety is the utmost virtue of human relations. That which exhausts the root and origin is called the Dao; that which is applied to human principles is called filial piety. The Dao can penetrate the generation of the myriad things, yet none know whence it arises—hence it is called wondrous function. Filial piety is the good service of one’s parents, exhausting reverence and compliance, penetrating to the numinous—hence it is called utmost virtue.

It embraces and revolves Heaven and Earth, engenders and nurtures the myriad things, subtly completes their forms, and bestows their natures and lifespans. *Nature* refers to the substance of hardness and softness; *lifespan* refers to the exhaustion of a single term. Its achievement is most substantial, yet it does not serve as a storehouse for things, nor as an office for affairs. It does not claim merit as its own, and though one may seek it through touch, sight, or hearing, none can possess it—thus it is named the Dao. Though it subtly completes the myriad kinds and carves the multitude of forms, when one seeks the master of life, no trace of it is seen—hence it is named the Dao. The Dao is called *emptiness and penetration*. When applied to humanity, it is named *filial piety*.

Filial piety is the name for the good service of one’s parents. In serving one’s parents well, reverence and compliance are fundamental. One’s intent must accord with them, complying with their countenance in all things. In uttering a single word or raising a single thought, one does not dare forget one’s parents. In moving a hand or placing a foot, one does not dare forget one’s parents. In serving one’s lord, one does not dare be disloyal; in dealing with friends, one does not dare be untrustworthy; in facing subordinates, one does not dare be disrespectful; in pursuing goodness, one does not dare be idle. Even when dwelling alone in a chamber, one does not dare relax one’s sincerity—this is called *complete filial piety*. Thus, the utmost of filial sincerity penetrates to the numinous, shines throughout the Four Seas, and invariably responds to what is felt—this is the result of the good service of one’s parents.

Of old, Shun was greatly filial. His stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly sought to harm him, yet Shun’s heart grew only more reverent, fearful but without resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well and then filled it with earth from below, Heaven bestowed its favor, and the numinous spirits shook with power, allowing him to emerge from a hidden tunnel. He served his parents with ever-greater care, and by this, his dark virtue flourished, and he became lord of the world—this was the result of the good service of his parents. According to the *Records of the Historian*: Shun’s father, Gusou, and his half-brother both wished to kill him. They sent Shun to repair a granary, then Gusou set fire to it from below. Shun used two conical hats to shield himself as he descended and escaped, surviving. Later, they sent Shun to dig a well, and he secretly excavated a side tunnel. After he had entered deeply, Gusou and Xiang filled the well with earth, but Shun emerged through the hidden tunnel and escaped. Such were the events. At that time, Heaven, bestowing its fine virtue, stirred Shun’s heart, and the numinous spirits blazed forth, allowing him to avoid harm. After his escape, he served his father with even greater diligence. Yao, recognizing his sageliness, tested him through many trials, and afterward abdicated his throne to him.

King Wen, when he was crown prince, was greatly filial. Morning and evening, he would invariably arrive outside the door of his father’s chamber and ask the attendants: "Is he at peace today? How is he?"

The *temple attendant* was a eunuch official, one who served at the ruler’s side. When he said, "At peace," the crown prince’s face would soften with joy. If there was the slightest sign of discomfort, the crown prince’s expression would fill with worry. Morning and evening, when food was presented—meaning the attendants brought meals to the lord—the crown prince would always observe whether the temperature was appropriate. Only after confirming what nourishment had been served would he withdraw, knowing the quantity consumed.

When the temple attendant reported illness, the crown prince would don solemn robes and fast, for when the lord was ill, the crown prince dressed with utmost gravity and purified his heart, concentrating his will to pray to the spirits for protection. He would respectfully inspect the food prepared by the royal chef and personally examine the garments offered as tribute. If the lord tasted the food and found it good, the crown prince would also eat his fill; if the lord found it lacking, the crown prince would not eat to satisfaction, and only when the lord recovered would he return to his usual state.

If the lord later erred, the crown prince would speak in a gentle voice to admonish him subtly. Whatever the lord cherished, no matter how small, the crown prince treated it with solemn reverence, never daring to slight what his father and ruler loved. Thus, filial piety perfected his person, and the Dao harmonized all under Heaven.

The *Ya* states: "King Wen ascended and descended, ever at the Lord’s side." The *Ya* refers to the *Greater Ya* section of the *Book of Songs*. *Ascended* means to rise; *Lord* refers to Heaven; *at the side* means to assist. It speaks of King Wen’s conduct, which Heaven always aided. It says that in King Wen’s stillness and action, advance and retreat, Heaven invariably supported him, so that Zhou could not harm him. *Supported* means to assist. King Wen served Zhou, and Heaven assisted him, so even though King Zhou of Yin was tyrannical, he could not readily harm Wen.

The dream of "nine lifespans" is recorded in the *Record of Rites*: When King Wen fell ill, it took twelve days for him to recover. He asked King Wu, "What did you dream?" King Wu replied, "I dreamed the Lord granted me nine lifespans." King Wen said, "What do you think it means?" King Wu said, "There are nine states in the west—will you ultimately pacify them?" King Wen said, "No. I am ninety of your ninety, and I share three with you." King Wen died at ninety-seven, and King Wu at ninety-three.

Thirty generations were divined, seven hundred years were foretold—this was Heaven’s mandate, the result of serving one’s parents with goodness. The *Zuozhuan* states: "When King Cheng established the tripods at Jiaru, it was divined that there would be thirty generations and seven hundred years—this was Heaven’s mandate." Min Ziqian asked, "I have been fortunate to hear the way of serving parents well. May I ask about the principle of teaching one’s children?" Confucius said, "In all cases, the Three Kings taught their children by demonstrating ritual and music. *Demonstrating* means to show. Music cultivates the inner self, harmonizing the heart; ritual cultivates the outer self, refining one’s bearing. When ritual and music are practiced together, virtue and demeanor shine forth in one’s appearance, enabling one to be warmly respectful and civilized.

Now, if a minister would sacrifice his life for the ruler’s benefit, how much more should he benefit himself to serve his ruler well? Therefore, they selected loyal, upright, and steadfast gentlemen as tutors, so that they might understand the Dao of father and son, ruler and minister, elder and younger. Only after knowing how to be a son can one be a father; only after knowing how to be a minister can one be a ruler; only after knowing how to serve others can one employ them. This is the principle by which the Three Kings taught their children." The Three Kings refer to the kings of the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties.

Min Ziqian withdrew and practiced this at home. For three years, no one could find fault with his words toward his parents or brothers. He served his parents above and deferred to his brothers below, achieving utmost goodness and beauty. Thus, no one spoke ill of him. Among his acquaintances, he was praised for his trustworthiness; in his village, for his benevolence; in his clan, for his fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtuous conduct spread throughout the world—this was the result of serving his parents well.

The crown prince of Qi sat upon the Clear Terrace when Yan Duke Zhuang, named Ta, arrived. The duke wore a tall hat and a stern expression, with a jade-hilted sword at his left waist and jade pendants at his right. The light from the left shone upon the right, and the light from the right shone upon the left—meaning the radiance of the jade ornaments illuminated one another. The crown prince continued reading without looking up. Duke Zhuang asked him, "Does Qi possess treasures?" The crown prince replied, "A ruler who is trustworthy and ministers who are loyal, with the people supporting their superiors—these are Qi’s treasures." Duke Zhuang Ta immediately removed his sword and departed, submitting to righteousness. This illustrates that the noble person values virtue, not ostentatious adornment.

Alas! Do people have biases and blind spots without ever realizing them? The worthy see them and forgive without speaking; petty men, in their reckless affection, speak excessively; relatives, out of pity and jealousy, speak ambiguously. How could one with biases and blind spots fail to recognize them? *How* means *why*. Therefore, the noble person examines himself as if he always has faults. Wearing his clothes, eating his food, knowing his faults yet lacking the strength to correct them—this the noble person considers shameful. It speaks of a minister who cannot rectify anything.

When about to speak, if one knows it will certainly not be heeded, the noble person rarely speaks. If the ruler does not accept loyal admonition, he speaks little to avoid calamity. When criticizing the faults of others, does one first examine one’s own goodness? When condemning others’ wrongdoing, does one first examine one’s own rectitude? This is called *reflecting on clarity*—first scrutinizing one’s own goodness and rectitude, then criticizing others’ wrongdoing.

The son of Di Xi was extremely filial and cautious. Di Xi, pitying his son, often spoke to him falsely. When Di Xi went out in the morning and returned at dusk, he would say, "So-and-so has died." His son believed him, but later found that so-and-so was still alive.

One evening, he would say, "Yi is about to harm someone." His son, fearing he would seek vengeance, kept watch. Yet no sign of malice appeared. Another evening, he would say, "Ding has fallen ill." His son observed him, and indeed, Ding was free of affliction—this was always the case.

*Observed* means to watch; *affliction* means distress; *always* means entirely. As time passed, though the son remained filial and cautious, he could no longer trust or obey his father’s words. The people of his village and state grew resentful of his reckless speech and plotted to kill him. When Di Xi heard this, he was terrified and returned to warn his son. The son did not fully believe him, but soon after, Di Xi was murdered.

This passage warns against speaking carelessly of political harm. Even one’s beloved son may not be trusted, leading to murder—how much less so others? Those who speak excessively are called *careless and exposed*, yet some are sparing in words but still indiscreet. Those who are *frivolous* are called *unsettled*, yet some appear composed while their hearts are restless. *Frivolous* means flighty and impulsive. Those who are *disorderly* are called *petty and coarse*, yet some appear pure while their inner selves are tainted. If one were to enumerate such cases, they could not all be recorded. Without thorough discernment, who could fully investigate and understand them?

There are times when one cannot but respond—outwardly still, yet inwardly stirred, easily moved but difficult to calm. This refers to those who, upon seeing profit, greedily pursue it, growing ever more avaricious, thus wearing themselves out and finding no peace. There are times when one cannot but seek employment—internally desiring, yet outwardly waiting, finding joy only upon attainment. This refers to those who, stirred by passions and desires, crave external conditions, their hearts set on fulfillment, rejoicing when they obtain what they seek, unaware that their restless minds harm their nature.

Thus, those who are outwardly still but inwardly restless damage their nature through anxious thoughts; those who chase profit through relentless toil harm their reputation through exhausting labor. Only those who are serene and free of passions, unenticed by fame or gain, may then preserve their well-being and wholeness of nature.

Some in this world, when their ambitions go unfulfilled, claim they have not met their time—this is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson-necked crime, awaiting execution when the moment arrives. How perilous! Those who cannot conduct themselves with caution and speak with restraint, offending the ruler of their time, differ not from bearing the guilt of decapitation, awaiting the hour of their execution. *Crimson* refers to the color of blood.

Those of vast talent and profound understanding who go unrecognized and unappointed may rightly say that the times are not unclean, but their fate has not aligned—is this not true?

Those skilled in remonstrance ensure they preserve the other’s nature while pruning the roots of their emotions—thus, both parties advance in harmony, and mutual respect deepens. Those unskilled in remonstrance assail the other’s nature and remain blind to the source of their emotions—thus, mutual suspicion and resentment accumulate day by day.

What children dismiss, the aged condemn;
what delights the eyes and ears, the mind deems a malady.

To harshly reproach the foolishness of the world is to reveal one’s own lack of worth;
to harshly reproach the delusion of the world is to reveal one’s own lack of clarity.
The worthy and enlightened should practice forbearance—
reprove not the foolish and deluded.

To reproach the multitude for their foolishness while lacking worth is to invite ruin;
to reproach the multitude for their delusion while lacking clarity is to invite harm.
The foolish and deluded suffer no loss—
only the harsh reproacher wounds himself in vain.

**Chapter Eight: The Way of Agriculture**

Grain is the people’s Heaven.
In governing a state, agriculture is the foundation.
When people abandon the root to pursue the branch,
commands cannot be unified—
the *root* refers to agriculture,
the *branch* to the pursuit of superficial profit.
When people chase superficial profit,
deceit and cunning multiply,
and no single command can restrain them.
Without unified commands,
neither defense nor warfare is possible.
With profit-seeking diversions,
hearts are divided—
thus, neither steadfast defense nor victorious warfare can be achieved.

When people abandon the root to pursue the branch,
their livelihoods grow meager.
With meager livelihoods, they lightly abandon their homes;
with light abandonment, the state suffers frequent calamities.
All cultivate distant ambitions,
and none remain settled in heart.

When people abandon the root to pursue the branch, they become cunning;
with cunning, deceit multiplies;
with deceit, laws and decrees are manipulated—
right is made wrong, and wrong is made right.

The way by which the sage-kings of antiquity governed their people
was first to ensure their sustenance.
Ensuring sustenance was not merely for material gain—
it was to honor the fulfillment of their will,
a will directed toward the people’s peace.

When people are well-sustained, they remain simple;
when simple, they are easily employed;
when easily employed, the borders are secure;
when secure, the ruler’s position is exalted.

When people are well-sustained, they become like children—
free of divergent ambitions.
Like children, they harbor few private interests;
with few private interests, public laws stand firm.

When strength is devoted to deep cultivation,
livelihoods grow abundant—
*abundant* meaning prosperous.
With prosperous livelihoods, people do not lightly scatter;
without light scattering, they die in their place without second thoughts—
thus, the world unites in a single heart.

When the world unites in a single heart,
even the governance of the Xuanyuan and Jilian Emperors would not surpass it.
Xuanyuan and Jilian were enlightened rulers of antiquity.

The reason the sage-emperors of old esteemed farming and weaving
was to make them the foundation of instruction.
Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords in plowing the sacred field,
while officials of all ranks were rewarded according to merit to encourage the people to value production—
*ranks* referring to hierarchy.
As the *Monthly Ordinances* states:
"In the first month, when the vital energy is balanced, the Son of Heaven selects an auspicious day, personally carries the plow and plowshare, places them to the right of his chariot, and leads the dukes, ministers, and feudal lords in plowing the sacred field.
The Son of Heaven makes three furrows,
the Three Dukes five,
and the ministers and feudal lords nine."
Thus, merit was rewarded to encourage the people.

The empress and consorts led the palace ladies in silkworm rearing at the suburban altars, tending the mulberry fields of the public estate to encourage diligent labor—a return to fundamental instruction. As the *Monthly Ordinances* states: "In the third month, when the vital energy is balanced, the authorities are commanded not to fell mulberry or silkworm-thorn trees. Then, the implements are prepared. The empress fasts and purifies herself to offer sacrifices to the silkworm ancestors, then personally gathers mulberry leaves to promote sericulture."

The *Record of Sacrifices* says: "In antiquity, the Son of Heaven and feudal lords necessarily had public mulberry groves and silkworm chambers, built near rivers. The ruler divined among the three palace ladies, the wives of high ministers, and the concubines to select the most auspicious, who entered the silkworm chamber. The concubines personally tended the silkworms, presented the cocoons to the ruler, and then offered them to the empress. The empress reeled three cocoons by hand, then distributed them to the three palaces. The most auspicious among the high ministers’ wives and concubines were tasked with reeling the silk. This was to encourage women’s instruction."

Men do not weave yet are clothed; women do not plow yet are fed. Through the exchange of labor between men and women, their occupations mutually sustain one another—this was the system of the sage-kings. *Exchange* means to barter. Thus, they revered the seasons and cherished the days, measuring tasks by their substance to assess merit. *Measuring* means to quantify. They did not rest unless aged, nor cease unless ill. The toil of one man fed ten. The foremost farmers fed ten people.

In the pressing affairs of the season, earthworks were not initiated, nor were armies mobilized. Men did not go forth to welcome brides, nor were women married outside—*one version reads "grand marriage."* This was to avoid hindering agriculture. *Earthworks, military campaigns, and weddings* all referred to obstructing farming. *Welcoming* meant men did not personally receive brides.

The Yellow Emperor said: "The four seasons cannot be made correct; one can only rectify the five grains." Cultivation is undertaken by man, *cultivation* meaning to sow. Growth comes from Heaven, nourishment from Earth. Thus, furrows must accommodate the foot, hoeing must accommodate the hoe—*hoeing* means to weed. *Hoe* refers to the weeding tool. Weeding must accommodate the hand—*weeding* means to clear grass. This is called the *Dao of cultivation*. Seedlings should allow room for the foot, tilling room for the hoe, and weeding room for the hand.

Farmers refine food, artisans refine tools, merchants refine goods. *Refine* means to cultivate. If the seasons are not revered and earthworks are imposed, this is called *great calamity*. For a ruler to be irreverent is the path to great misfortune.

In cultivation, those who begin early act ahead of time, while those who begin late fall behind. If cold and heat are unbalanced, crops suffer many disasters. *Too early or too late* refers to failing to attain the harmonious qi. Fifty-seven days after the winter solstice, plants flourish—*a decade* means ten days. The fifty-seventh day falls within the *Beginning of Spring* solar term, when grasses and trees burst forth. Thus, plowing begins.

The *Dao of agriculture* is this: upon seeing life, plant life; upon seeing death, harvest death. This means to act in accord with Heaven’s timing. *Plant* means to sow; *harvest* means to reap. Heaven bestows the seasons, while man produces wealth—it does not make appointments with man. In years of plenty, the earth is sacrificed to; in years of famine, the earth is sacrificed to. *Years of plenty* means abundant harvests; *years of famine* means poor harvests. *Sacrificing to the earth* means offering to the altars of soil and grain. The spring sacrifice prays for abundance; the autumn sacrifice gives thanks for ripeness. Whether in years of plenty or famine, sacrifices are made to entreat the earth, for the benefit of life is weighty.

Do not lose the proper time: act when the season arrives, cease when it passes. Even the strength of the old and weak can be fully employed. *Act* means to reach. Though old and weak, they can be made to exhaust their strength—this is how plowing follows the season. Those who do not know the time act before it arrives, *meaning they begin farming too early,* or long for it after it has passed—*meaning the season has passed, yet they yearn for it, which is too late.* Or they neglect it when it arrives—*though the time is right, they exert little effort, so the harvest is meager.* These three are the lowest in agricultural practice. Though they engage in farming, they do not grasp the season, hence they are called the lowest.

Tilling must be done early to make the soil fertile and loose. Hoeing must be done in the early season, for then weeds die easily and the soil’s veins become rich and soft. Crops desire to sprout in dust-like soil and grow in firm earth—*grow* means to lengthen. Sowing requires soil as fine as dust, so the earth is porous and roots run deep. When seedlings grow, rain firms the soil, and firmness strengthens the stalks.

Be careful with the seeds: do not make them too dense, nor too sparse. *Dense* means crowded. When applying soil, do not make it insufficient, nor excessive. *Applying soil* means placing seeds in the earth. Insufficient seeds lead to sparsity and waste land; excessive seeds lead to density and harm the grain. Neither waste nor harm—take the middle way.

Furrows should be deep and straight, ridges fertile and level. *Straight* means upright. Deep, straight furrows allow water to flow swiftly; fertile, level ridges ensure even moisture. Below, they receive yin; above, they receive yang—*yin below* means water’s moisture; *yang above* means the sun’s qi. Then life is completed.

Seedlings planted in rows grow quickly; the strong and weak do not harm one another, so they grow swiftly. Straight rows allow passage through their centers, thinning them to admit cool breezes. Then there will be harvests and great success.

If crops appear abundant from afar but sparse up close, it is the earth’s theft—*due to barren soil, seedlings are not lush, as if stolen.* If weeds are not removed, they overgrow; if removed, the seedlings are left bare—this is man’s harm. *Remove* means to tend. If weeds are allowed to flourish before removal, the seedlings will be bare—this is harm from human effort.

Weak seedlings desire solitude—*wishing to grow singly, not clustered.* Strong seedlings desire to dwell together—*to live among many, sharing shade.* Ripe seedlings desire mutual support—*to avoid damage from falling.* When these three are grouped, crops yield abundant grain.

The three types, like human clans, yield greater harvests when they mutually support one another. All seedlings suffer when they do not sprout and perish together—uneven growth allows large seedlings to oppress small ones, stunting their flourishing. Thus, early sprouts produce fine grain, while late ones yield □. The strong oppress the weak, so late sprouts fail to bear fruit. Therefore, in cultivation, one retains the elder and removes the younger. This analogy compares seedlings to people: early sprouts are elder brothers, late ones younger brothers.

For trees in fertile soil, do not let them grow too luxuriantly; for those in barren soil, do not allow them to grow singly in isolation. *Qiao* refers to barren land. Growing singly and isolated leaves them vulnerable to wind and drought. Luxuriant growth in fertile soil leads to much blight; solitary growth in barren soil leads to much death. Those who do not understand weeding remove the elder and nurture the younger, forsaking the grain to harvest □. When upper and lower are unsettled, crops die in great numbers.

Timely millet grows tall with large ears, its grains round and husks thin, sweet and fragrant, easy to hull and nourishing to eat. *He* refers to millet. *Tong* is the ear’s stem. *Yuan* means round. *Yi* describes its taste, sweet as malt sugar. Untimely millet has long awns and slender stalks, its ears sharp and filled with □, its grains green and withered. *Shen mang* means long awns. *Rui* means slender. *Qing ling* describes its green grains.

Timely millet has long, awnless ears, its grains plump and husks few. *Bo* means to rub the grain by hand to remove the husk. Untimely millet has thick roots and flowering stalks, its leaves lush and ears short. *Ben* refers to roots. *Hua jing* describes stalks with flowers. *Gao* means lush and thick.

Timely rice has thick stalks and long stems, its ears like a horse’s tail. *Bao* means large. *Ma wei* describes long ears. Untimely rice has slender stalks lacking vigor, its husks thick, and it withers and dies.

Timely hemp has sparse nodes and bright color, its fibers strong and roots small. *Yang* means bright and radiant. *Jian* means firm, describing its tough skin. Untimely hemp has many branches, short stalks, prominent nodes, and insect-damaged leaves. *Fan ke* refers to many branches. *An jie* means high nodes.

Timely beans have long stalks and short stems, their pods clustered in groups of fourteen, with many branches and numerous nodes, their leaves lush and pods full, heavy to the hand and satisfying to eat. *Shu* refers to beans. *Zu* means clustered. *Xi* means abundant. Untimely beans grow long vines, their leaves floating and roots weak, their nodes sparse and pods small.

Timely wheat has long stems and clustered ears, its grains arranged in rows of fourteen, its husks thin and color yellow, nourishing to eat, strengthening the body. *Bo yi* refers to husks. *Tun* means yellow. Its ears bear fourteen grains per row. Untimely wheat swells with disease, its seedlings weak and ears bristling. *Fu zhong* describes thick, insect-ridden stalks and roots. *Sha sui* means many awns.

Thus, timely crops yield abundance, while untimely ones yield scarcity. When all grains are cultivated appropriately and consumed, they fortify the four limbs, sharpen hearing and sight, prevent *qi* from invading, and spare the body from ailments. The four limbs are the *si wei*. How excellent are Confucius’s words: “In winter, a full stomach warms the body; in summer, it cools it.” When warmth and coolness are seasonally fitting, people suffer no illness; free from illness, epidemics do not spread; without epidemics, all fulfill their natural lifespans. Thus it is said: “Grain is the sky of man.” Therefore, enlightened rulers devote themselves to agriculture. A ruler who neglects agriculture abandons his people. A ruler who abandons his people—what kingdom can he govern?

**Military Strategy, Chapter Nine**
Warfare is an inauspicious instrument, to be employed only when unavoidable.

Duke Jing of Qin sought to display his military might to the world. Qin relied on the steep passes of Xiao and its formidable army of brave soldiers, so it wished to demonstrate its strength, leaving none in the world to dare oppose it. *Shi* means to display.

He sent the minister Bao Rong to compel Kang Cangzi to come. *Shu zhang* was a Qin noble rank. Bao Rong was a person’s name. He offered twelve ruined cities as inducement, secretly pressuring him. *Zhou* means secret. Desiring Kang Cangzi’s counsel, he offered twelve cities to secure his arrival; fearing he might refuse, he secretly sent Bao Rong to compel him.

Kang Cangzi arrived and was lodged as an honored guest at Rongquan. Rongquan was a place in Qin. For three days, Duke Jing could not broach the matter he wished to discuss. This means he sought to question him but could not.

Seating himself below and facing north, he struck his tablet to the ground, saying: "Does Heaven truly have no intention to aid this orphaned ruler?" Facing north and striking the tablet were acts of utmost ritual propriety.

Kang Cangzi’s gaze subtly shifted as he replied: "I deemed Your Lordship’s inquiry extraordinary—why then this wearisome insistence?" *Oilran* describes a slight movement; *kui* means to incline; *mian* signifies a sidelong glance. *Zhen* is the royal "I." "I thought Your Lordship’s question possessed rare depth—why this fixation on trivial matters?" He alluded to the subject of warfare and conquest. "Yet if one follows another’s desires to seek rectification, there is no principle by which it may be deemed proper." He meant that since the Duke had framed his question in terms of military force, he would respond in kind to correct his intent, though this was not the highest principle.

Duke Jing bowed once, then again, gathering his embroidered robe and straightening his tablet. Lowering his head, he sat and said: "This is truly what Heaven has ordained." *Furen* refers to the embroidered lapel of a robe; *yishou* means to bow the head. "I wish to receive your instruction as a mandate from Heaven."

Kang Cangzi looked up at the rafters and sighed, then lowered his head and composed his expression, saying: "The origin of warfare and its beginnings arose together with humankind." *Cui* means rafter; *yangcui* describes looking up at the roof beams. *Xu* is the sound of a sigh. He sighed toward the rafters, lamenting that the Duke had not inquired into the highest Dao. "Warfare has existed alongside humanity since the very beginning—it is not unique to the present age. Generally, warfare arises from human might. The possession of might is an innate quality bestowed by Heaven." Human nature, including joy and anger, is fundamentally received from Heaven. "Anger gives rise to might, and might gives rise to the origins of warfare. Thus, the roots of warfare extend far back into antiquity. There has never been even a brief moment when it was not employed." *Shaoxuan* means a short while.

The emotions of joy and anger are employed without constancy, thus there has never been even a brief moment when they were not in use. The noble and the base, the old and the young, the worthy and the foolish—all alike share this. By observing the stirring of anger, one knows the origins of warfare. To discern the omens of war: when resentment lingers in the heart yet remains unexpressed, this is war; when the gaze turns fierce and the countenance shifts, this is war; when haughty words are spoken and forceful thrusts are made, this is war; when boastful strife and violent assaults erupt, this is war. These four are but disputes of greater or lesser scale. *Hui* means anger; *zuose* describes a stern expression; *zun* also means to push, referring to mutual provocation. Though these four differ in magnitude, all arise from a heart of anger, and thus are war.

Even before the time of Chiyou, men already brandished timber and fought. Chiyou, a minister to the feudal lords in the time of the Yellow Emperor, had eighty-one brothers, each with a head of bronze and a brow of iron. He waged war against the Emperor at the wilds of Zhuolu, forged weapons, and was later destroyed by the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor employed water and fire—some diverted rivers to flood cities, others set fires to burn them. Gonggong rebelled, contending with Zhuanxu for the realm. The Five Emperors likewise contended with one another, each rising and falling in turn; the victorious ruled. The way of warfare knows both decline and resurgence, yet all who prevailed did so by aligning with Heaven.

There are those who die from swallowing medicine—yet to ban all physicians in the world would be wrong. There are those who die from boarding a boat—yet to ban all ships in the world would be wrong. There are those who lose their states through warfare—yet to ban all warfare in the world would be wrong. Warfare cannot be abolished, just as water and fire cannot: when used well, they bring fortune; when used poorly, they bring disaster.

Thus, the rod of anger must not be laid to rest within the household, punishments must not be laid to rest within the state, and military campaigns must not be laid to rest in the world. *Chi* refers to the whip or staff; *yan* means to cease. The sage-kings of antiquity had righteous armies but no idle armies. A righteous army follows Heaven and responds to the people, punishing tyranny and chaos. When an army truly acts with righteousness to punish a cruel ruler and rescue the suffering, the people rejoice as a filial child beholding a loving parent, or as a starving servant encountering a feast. They cry out and rush forward as a powerful crossbow loosed into a deep valley. *Zhen* means to rescue; *li* refers to servants. The comparison to a crossbow shot into a deep valley illustrates the swiftness of the rescue.

The outcome of victory or defeat does not depend on external signs but must return to human nature. The outcome of war does not lie in external verification but in returning to the sentiments of the people. Human nature desires life and abhors death, seeks honor and shuns disgrace. When the principles of life and death, honor and disgrace are unified, the soldiers of the Three Armies can be made of one heart. If the ruler shares in the life and death, honor and disgrace of the Three Armies, then though the armies be vast, they can be made of one heart.

Generally, a ruler desires his multitudes to be of one mind. When the Three Armies are of one heart, commands can be issued without fear of opposition. The supreme armies of antiquity valued their commands above all. Thus, the strength of their commands made their enemies weak, and the trustworthiness of their commands made their enemies yield. Victory is first secured here, then secured there. To assess the enemy and secure victory, one must first assess oneself. If one shares life and death with the multitudes and unites the Three Armies in heart, then victory over the enemy is assured. If this is truly so, how could the enemy ever prevail?

When the enemy approaches, it is to seek gain. If they come and meet death, then flight becomes their gain. If all enemies see flight as gain, then blades will never meet. This is the supreme army.

Arrogance, cruelty, deceit, and treachery stand in opposition to righteousness and principle. Their forces cannot both prevail; they cannot coexist. Thus, when a righteous army enters the enemy’s territory, the people know where to seek refuge. When the army reaches the outskirts of a city or state, it does not trample crops, does not desecrate tombs, does not plunder stores, does not burn homes. It captures people but treats them generously and returns them. It keeps its promises, seizes the enemy’s resources to weaken them, makes clear what is good and evil, and demonstrates what is right and wrong—first showing them righteousness.

If, despite this, there remain those who are stubborn, cruel, domineering, and defiant, refusing to submit, then the use of force is permissible. *Bihen* means obstinate cruelty; *dang* means reckless defiance. After first demonstrating righteousness, if there are still those who remain wicked and disobedient, then punishing them with force is permissible.

First, a proclamation is issued: "Our army comes to avenge the people’s enemies and to follow the Dao of Heaven." Thus, when they conquer a state, they do not massacre its people but punish only those who deserve punishment—only the cruel ruler. Then, they select and honor the worthy and virtuous, seek out the orphaned and infirm, the elderly, and rescue them. They provide for the orphaned and infirm, respect the elderly, open the treasuries and granaries, distributing their wealth and grain without keeping anything for themselves, and bestow honors with great care. They do not hoard their gains but share them with all, offering courtesies to seek out the worthy.

If there were a man who could save a single life from death, the people of the world would vie to serve him. To save a life means to restore it. If a man, through righteousness, could restore one life from death, the world would hasten to serve him. A righteous army saves not one but many lives—who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, the people of neighboring states flock to it like flowing water, and the people of the conquered state look upon it as parents. The farther it advances, the more people it gains.

Before the words were finished, Lord Jing rose, bowed deeply, and said: "I have been fortunate to hear your teachings, Master. Unknowingly, my spirit fills the cosmos, and my will knows where to turn. My heart swells with ever greater reverence."

Having heard the Way of the righteous army, he cast aside his deceitful and arrogant heart, and thus his qi and will swelled to fill the cosmos, his purpose knowing where to turn. Thereupon, he stepped forward, raised his voice in a toast, and wished Master Kangcang longevity. With each step he advanced, he silently offered blessings, thereby honoring the master and revering the Way. He bowed and took his place at the head of the disciples’ ranks, maintaining strict observance in the purification chamber.

For over a month, at the hour when the celestial gate opened—*Tian Guan*, that is, the *chen* hour—he practiced the Way by day. *Tian Guan* refers to the celestial net, meaning the *chen* hour. *Practicing the Way* means performing the rites of a disciple.
