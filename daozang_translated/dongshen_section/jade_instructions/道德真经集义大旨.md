**Volume One: Preface to the Illustrated Sequence of the Dao-De Jing**

**The Valley Spirit Diagram**
The Valley Spirit is the divine essence housed within the five viscera.
Many have interpreted this meaning, some pointing to the Mysterious Female as the heart, others to the Valley Spirit as the heart—both are incorrect.
Know this: the Spirit is the divine essence of the five viscera. When essence is unexhausted and *qi* is unimpaired, the Spirit is nourished and does not perish, and the form’s visage shines with radiance.

**The Thirty-Spoke Diagram**
The Obtained-One Diagram
The Dao-Generates-One Diagram
Speaking metaphorically of humanity, all things are the same.
The "few" are youthful men and women;
The "middle" are middle-aged men and women;
The "long" are aged men and women.
If death does not come in its proper time, then *qi* disperses and I do not return to the Two *Qi*’s—*Hun-Yuan*’s unity.

**The Birth-and-Death Diagram**
The Dao-Generates-Virtue-Nourishes Diagram
The Dao generates me; virtue stores me; form shapes me; power perfects me—this is the marvelous work.

**The Great Emptiness Begins with One Diagram**
The boundless Dao, void and natural, gives rise to One *Qi*, congealing into *Hun-Dun* (Chaos), within which the Three Powers are contained.
Once the Three Powers are divided, the upper and lower positions are established—not through sensation, but naturally.
Thus it is said: *The Void is natural.*

The Dao originates from the Void, and from this One *Qi*, the myriad things are generated to fulfill daily needs, without end.

**The Nine Heavens Generate the Spirit Diagram**
Green, yellow, and white each generate three heavens—three threes make nine heavens.
Each of the nine heavens generates three heavens—three nines make twenty-seven heavens.
Combined with the three palaces of Metal, Fire, and Earth, totaling nine heavens, there are thirty-six heavens.

*The Scripture of the Primordial Arrangement of Heaven* states:
*"The Primordial Origin’s *Qi* pervades the luminous body, and the Three *Qi* transform into form, manifesting the Three Caverns.
The first is the Azure Light, born in the Heavenly Primordial, the second is the White Light, born in the Human Mysterious, the third is the Yellow Light, born in the Earthly Primordial.
From these three colors, the Nine Lights are generated.
The Partial Arising of the Dharma-Body shines resplendently.
Now, detailing the origins of the Three Pure Ones, from the three colors, the Three Treasures are divided—all derived from One *Qi*.
Thus, the Great Void begins with One, One *Qi* divides into Three, establishing the *Qi*, colors, and forms of the Three Pure Ones.
Hence, the Three Pure Ones are called *Natural*.
Neither father nor mother, neither yin nor yang, they inherit the natural *qi* and give rise to the Three Extremes."

The Venerable Lord Laozi, across kalpas of transformation, manifests in heaven and earth, sometimes taking fetal form—his origin lies in the Three *Qi*’s divided lights forming the Three Pure Ones.

**The Nine-Colored Treasure Lights**
At first, *Hun-Hun* becomes the Azure Light.
*Hun* generates *Dong-Dong*, becoming the Red Light.
*Dong* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Azure Light.
*Yuan* generates *Hao-Hao*, becoming the Green Light.
*Hao* generates *Jing-Jing*, becoming the Yellow Light.
*Jing* generates *Dun-Dun*, becoming the White Light.
*Xuan* generates *Rong-Rong*, becoming the Purple Light.
*Rong* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Azure Light.
*Yan* generates *Yan-Yan*, becoming the Black Light.

From this, the Four Heavens of the East (East华), South (South极), West (West灵), and North (North真) are divided.
Each heaven generates eight heavens—such as the Great Sovereign, Yellow Ancestor, etc.
Four eights make thirty-two heavens, which are the Three Realms.
Combined with the four heavens above, there are thirty-six heavens.
The Great Luo and Middle Luo together make seventy-two, corresponding to the numbers of heaven and earth.
The seventy-two constellations, combined with the nine heavens above, form the eighty-one *Tai-Xuan*.
The Four Regions and Clans take this number.

**The Four Beginnings Diagram**
Earth obtains the number five as its root number, and also obtains four numbers, including one from Water, making five in total.
Earth corresponds to the *Kun* hexagram, divided into twelve—also called One *Qi*.
Thus, the Twelve Radiant Ones are opened to encompass the beginning.

**The Diagram of Responding to the Heart’s Use**
The True Person’s Precept:
Imagine the Twenty-Eight Constellations encompassing the body to assist the Seven Governors.
Following this method, each constellation spans thirteen degrees, storing an imagined year’s *gui* (retreat), calculating two degrees, alternating counts—twelve places, each storing two constellations, except the Heart, which stores four, totaling twenty-eight.
This is no other than pointing to the Dao generating the Mysterious Homeland, responding to the heart’s use—thus, the four central ones begin with the Void Constellation.

**The Dao-Generates-One Diagram**
Heaven’s arrangement of the Three Celestial Marks and command over all things is all from the Dao.
The Dao, without end or beginning, generates from the Mysterious Homeland.
According to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Child corresponds to the Void Constellation—One *Qi* returns to the Yellow Palace, then disperses, then generates, and all things receive their mandate here.
Thus, the Void is the Dao, and the Dao generates from the Void.
Considering heaven, the Void lies in the Mysterious Homeland’s profound darkness, and the Dao generates One.
Among the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the Void Constellation exists, and the twelve palace divisions include the Water Jar—speaking of the统 (unification) of Primordial *Qi*.
*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: In heaven, it is the Mysterious; on earth, it is the Female; in humanity, it is the Dao—this is because thunder returns to the Shocking.

**The Mysterious Female Diagram**
**The Heavenly Gate’s Opening and Closing: Guarding the Feminine Diagram**
The Dao is One.
One transforms into Three, becoming *Qian* (Creative)—*Qian* is yang.
*Qian* interchanges and transforms into *Kun* (Receptive)—yin and yang wax and wane, transforming here.
*Wei* and *Hai* intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* naturally unite—male does not depart from female; this is the Dao of Heaven.
Humans who embody this align with the Dao’s use.

**The Thirteen Birth-and-Death Diagram**
**The Thirteen Methods of Seizing Life to Avoid Death Diagram**
The Venerable Lord says:
True Water and True Fire correspond to the Dao’s true body and cannot be momentarily separated.
That which can be separated and yet preserved is neither thing nor person.
This meaning is like comparing worldly water and fire.
True Water and True Fire, *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) paired, with withdrawal and supplementation governed by principle, used at the proper time—
then these thirteen [methods] are not the same as the previous thirteen birth-and-death [cycles].

Thus it is said: **"The Way of Life Without Death"** lies therein.

The Dao has two Dao, and virtue has three virtue.
The first is the Dao of **Emptiness-Nothingness-No-Action**,
the second is the Dao of **One Qi with Action**—
Hence, the Dao has two Dao, yet they differ in depth and shallowness.
The Dao of **One Qi** is also called the **Supreme Virtue**.
From the **Supreme Virtue** downward, all belong to the realm of **Action**,
Thus they are called the **Three Virtue**.
By distinguishing the inner and outer, these are all the genuine paths of the Dao.

Now, the **Four Categories**—Dao, virtue, yin-yang, and human affairs—
when harmonized and unified, form a single school.
If one cannot reconcile them, then progress is obstructed at every turn,
and scholars must carefully examine this.

**Praise of the *Lǎozǐ***:
*"Great indeed is the Primordial Dao—
Transcending form and qi.
Before Heaven and Earth it was born,
Yet it gave birth to Heaven and Earth.
The Five Thousand Mysterious Characters
Established its teaching for the ages.
Through countless eons it endures,
The Dao is honored, virtue is exalted."*

**Preface to the *Lǎozǐ***:
*"Master Cóngyuǎn Dàshī, whose virtue is boundless and whose Dao is profound,
Observed and annotated the *Lǎozǐ* at Xuānyàoyuàn.
Master Liú Wéiyǒng compiled it.
Formerly, **Dìng Yìdōng**, a **Tàicháng Fēngdàfū**, **Tàifùshì Bù**, and **Jīngmìyuàn Biānxiū Guān**, verified the text."*

**From the *Shǐjì* Biographies:**

*"Old Master (Lǎozǐ) was a native of Lìxiàng, Qǔ County, in Chu—his clan was Lǐ, given name Ěr, courtesy name Bóyáng, with the sobriquet Dān. He served as the Keeper of the Royal Archives in Zhou. When Confucius visited Zhou and sought to inquire about rites from Old Master, the latter replied: ‘What you speak of—both the man and his bones—have long since decayed, yet his words remain. Moreover, a noble one, when the time is right, rides in a carriage; when the time is not, he travels in a humble cart. I have heard: a skilled merchant probes hidden treasures as if they were empty; a virtuous sage, though his power is great, appears as though foolish. This is all I have to tell you.’

Confucius departed and said to his disciples: ‘I know how birds fly, how fish swim, how beasts run. Those that run may be ensnared, those that swim may be hooked, those that fly may be struck with arrows. But as for the dragon—I cannot know how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to heaven. Today, I have seen Old Master—he is like the dragon!’

Old Master cultivated virtue and the Dao, devoting himself to obscurity and namelessness. After long residence in Zhou, seeing its decline, he departed westward. At the Pass, the Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘Master, you are about to withdraw. Please write a book for me.’ Thus Old Master composed the *Dàodéjīng* in two sections, expounding the meaning of virtue and the Dao in over five thousand words, and then departed—none knew his ultimate fate.

Later texts state: Old Master lived to over a hundred and sixty, or perhaps over two hundred, due to his cultivation of the Dao and longevity. One hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ death, the Zhou Grand Historian Xiān saw Qin Xiàn Gōng and said: ‘When Qin first separated from Zhou, it will reunite after five hundred years, and after seventy years of unity, a sovereign ruler will arise.’ Some say this ‘Xiān’ was Old Master; others deny it—none know for certain. Old Master was a hidden sage.

Old Master’s son was named Zōng, who served as a general for Wèi and was ennobled at Duàngān. Zōng’s son was Zhù, Zhù’s son was Gōng, and Gōng’s great-grandson Jiǎ served under Emperor Wén of Hàn. Jiǎ’s son Jiě became the Grand Tutor to the King of Jiāoxī, and the family settled in Qí. Those who studied Old Master disparaged Confucian learning, and Confucian scholars likewise disparaged Old Master. ‘Different paths do not conspire together’—is this not so?"

**Ge Xianweng’s Preface:**

*"Old Master’s essence is the spontaneous unfolding of Nature itself. Born before the Primordial Void, arising without cause, traversing the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth—unfathomable, without termination, without limit, without extremity. Thus, without extremity, he aligns with the Great Dao to transform and give birth to Heaven and Earth, establishing roots and dispersing qi across the Ten Directions. Embracing the purest essence of virtue and the Dao, vast and boundless, beyond naming. Resplendent with its patterns, majestic in its achievements, profound beyond measure, august as the sovereign of the numinous. The Three Lights shine by its radiance; Heaven and Earth draw life from it; the Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches emit their essence through it. Lofty yet without subjects, noble yet without rank, encompassing without end—it teaches the Eight Directions of the heavenly hosts, universally propagating the Great Dao. Before the opening of creation, it descended to become the national teacher, generation after generation without cease. None can fathom its craftsmanship in forming the myriad things; it does not claim credit for its mysterious virtue. Thus, all sages revere it in common.

The Dao is honored, virtue is exalted—yet none commands it, for it is ever naturally so. Only Old Master embodies this.

In the Zhou era, it was said that the divine Li Mother gave birth to him by splitting her left armpit, and he emerged radiant, thus named Old Master. The title ‘Old Master’ arose from the Mysterious, existing before Heaven and Earth, beyond the bounds of decay and aging—hence the name. Though the world supposes Old Master originated in the Zhou, his title began in countless eons past, profound and obscure, distant beyond measure.

As the Dao declined and was not practiced, Old Master traveled westward across the world. At the Pass, Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ said: ‘The Great Dao is about to withdraw—please write a book for me.’ Thus he composed the *Dàodé* in two sections, five thousand words, as the upper and lower scriptures.

These five thousand words expound the source of virtue and the Dao, encompassing the great without omission, the minute without exclusion—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity. My former master said: ‘If one diligently studies it, the voice harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate, ascending in distant chant. The celestial hosts rejoice and invite the Mysterious Adepts. In quiet contemplation, seeking the True, all wonders converge. Observing form and shadow within, the spirit-qi endures eternally. Aligning with virtue and the Dao, all spirits submit; calamity vanishes from the Nine Shades, blessings arise in the Ten Directions, the nation is secure, the family is at peace—who can know this?

The text of *Wuwei* is not defiled by stagnation, nor adorned by glory, nor corrupted by obstruction, nor purified by clarity—it is natural. It manifests in response to the Dao, its teaching endless, its constancy unchanging. Thus, knowing constancy is enlightenment.

What does the Great Dao accomplish? Its propagation depends on humanity. This sublime tradition—how can one not study it with utmost precision? A rough draft is offered here; only those of the Dao will treasure it. This section is not yet pure, yet preserved due to its long transmission."

**Tang Emperor Xuānzōng’s Imperial Preface:**

*"Old Master was the inner title of the Supreme Primordial Emperor of the Dao. The Primordial Ancestor of the Dao descended and was born in Yí. Reverent and august, he commanded the clan name ‘Táng.’ His blessings extended without bound, his auspices far-reaching, his lineage unbroken like the gourd-vine. His traces of departure and return are fully recorded in the annals.

The Daoist tradition holds he was the Morning Pearl of Jade; Sima Qian called him a hidden sage. Yet Confucius took him as teacher, and in the *Analects*, he sighed at the dragon-like virtue of Old Master—thus, Confucius held no reservations.

After long service in the Zhou court, he prepared to enlighten the western reaches, and Gatekeeper Yín Xǐ requested he write a book."*

Thus, he expounded two chapters, elucidating the origin of **Dao** and **virtue** in nurturing life. Nothing escapes this principle.

Its essence lies in **governing the self and governing the state**.
To govern the state, one must abandon arrogance and ostentation, embracing **non-action** and **non-speech** as doctrine;
To govern the self, one must minimize private desires, striving for **emptiness of heart** and **fullness of belly** as primary concerns.
When comparing its grand intent, its meaning may be articulated.

Yet when delving into **exhausting principles and perfecting nature**, severing attachments and stilling thoughts, abiding in reality while practicing flexibility, attaining **sitting-forgetfulness** and discarding illumination—**reducing further, refining further**, reaching the **mystic yet deeper**—this is indeed beyond articulation or transmission.

Its teachings are **circular**, its text **concise**, its intent **unobstructed**, its words **universal**; thus, those who wander its halls all deem themselves to have ascended to the chamber and glimpsed its depths.
Yet upon meticulous study and profound contemplation, they then realize that even at the finest hair’s end, they have not grasped even a ten-thousandth part of it.

The *Classic* states:
*"There exists a primal unity, born before Heaven and Earth.
I know not its name; I call it Dao.
Forced to name it, I call it Great.
Thus, those who know the Great Dao grasp its **ultimate emptiness** and **mystic origin**—this is the forced name for its universal generation."*

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"At the beginning, there was the Non-being.
The Non-being—this is to say, the being is compared to the ineffable Non-being.*
Again, it says:
*The Non-being has no name.
The unnamed—this is before any forced naming.*
Thus, the *Classic* says:
*The Unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The forced name for universal generation is Dao.*
Thus, the *Classic* says:
*The Named is the mother of all things.*
Again, *Zhuangzi* says:
*When things obtain life, this is called virtue.*
Virtue—this is *obtaining*.
Speaking of Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations and boundless reach, all things draw upon the **mystic origin** to take form and be born; obtaining life is virtue.
Thus, the *Classic* says:
*The Dao generates it; virtue nurtures it.*
Then, those who know the Dao embody virtue, and virtue is the manifestation of the Dao.
Yet the *Classic* divides into upper and lower sections, first clarifying Dao and then virtue.
However, though the names of *body* and *function* may be separated, their essence cannot be divided.
Thus, the *Classic* says:
*Same origin, differing names—this is called the Mystic.
Speaking of its origin, it splits into two; speaking of its unity, it merges as one.
Thus, it is said: separable in name, inseparable in essence.*

Then, the *Upper Classic* says: *This is called Mystic Virtue*, again: *The vastness of virtue’s capacity*, again: *Virtue aligns with virtue*, again: *Constant virtue never departs.*
The *Lower Classic* says: *Only when Dao is lost does virtue arise*, again: *Return is the movement of Dao*, again: *Dao generates the One*, again: *The Great Dao is most easy.*
Thus, it is known that *body* and *function* alternate in exposition, each elucidating the core essence, without rigidly fixing their names to upper or lower sections.

*Classic*—this is the **direct path**, also the **constant way**, speaking of the Dao that universally traverses the direct and the enduring.

Each time I reflect upon the sacred ancestor’s teachings, bequeathed to his descendants for contemplation, in moments of rest from governance, I humbly devoted myself to its study.
Now, I further elucidate its essential mysteries in brief, for the written word cannot exhaust speech; I roughly outline the grand framework to aid those who seek.

Du Guangting’s Preface to *Zhūtāo Yùzhé* states:
The **Supreme Primordial Lord** descended and manifested his teachings in four stages, far and near.

The first: across countless eons, he assumed forms and adapted his transformations according to the age, encompassing the thousand-two-hundred titles and one-hundred-eighty names scattered throughout the scriptures, which may be verified.

The second: at the dawn of the Kaihuang era of this eon, he fulfilled the cosmic function, nurturing Heaven and Earth, gestating the sun and moon as the foundation of transformation, the root of Heaven and Earth. He dispersed **qi** and partitioned light, generating all things. From the first of the Five Sovereigns to before the Yin and Shang dynasties, he served as the teacher of emperors, appearing in each generation—such as **Yùhuá, Lǜtú, Guǎngchéng, and Yínshòu**, who revealed his presence through the times.

The Three Sovereigns passed, the Five Emperors did not return; the **Dragon Sage of the Cloud Records** shifted with the ages, his steps varying—**Yàotáng** grew weary of his position in old age, **Yúshùn** endured trials before ascending to rule. He governed the myriad lands, diligently attending to all affairs.

Old Lord was named **Yínshòu’s son**, residing in **Héyáng**, and transmitted the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue* to **Shùn**. This was the intent of the scripture.
Dao takes precedence in **non-action**; virtue follows in **having a name**.
This is also why the books of the Three Sovereigns speak of the **Great Dao**, while those of the Five Emperors speak of the **Constant Dao**.

Below this, he trimmed excessive rituals, combined the **love-extending** principle, reduced **bowing and deferential etiquette**, curbed **sharp cleverness**, rejected **military violence**, and suppressed **deceptive schemes**, guiding people back to **primordial simplicity and purity**, treating **non-action** as the ultimate governance.

Shùn had to exert force to implement this, exiling the wicked and appointing ministers, sharpening his senses, harmonizing the nine clans, and clarifying the people’s affairs—yet the **serene and pure Dao** could not be fully realized.

Thus, after **Yǔ and Tāng**, the world became a family possession, each cherishing their own kin. The Great Dao having faded, the **mystic transformation** no longer flowed; rituals and music grew elaborate, and laws and punishments were widely applied.

The third: the Lord descended as a divine manifestation during the **Xīnzhāo era of the Shang**, taking form in the year of **Wǔdīng**, born in **Bó**—today’s **Zhēnyuán County’s Jiǔlóngjǐng, Tàiqīng Palace**. Sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, he subtly transformed the myriad lands. In the **Gengchǒu year of King Zhāo of Zhou**, he transmitted these two classics to **Emperor Yín Xǐ**, spreading them across the world, so that all could hear of them.

The fourth: he prepared to transform the **Western Wastes**, meeting **Emperor Yín Xǐ** at the **Qīngyáng Market in western Shǔ** to manifest his birth—this was the **Dīnsì year of King Zhāo**. This is the *Dao De Jing* transmitted from **Hánguān Pass**, revered and practiced across generations. Wise emperors and learned scholars have annotated and elucidated it in over sixty schools, including:

Thus, the commentaries are now widely expounded.

The interpretations vary among schools—some delve deeply into **Zhōngxuān** [重玄], avoiding entanglement in **kōngyǒu** [空有]; others indulge in **yīnyuán** [因果], rigidly adhering to **sāngshēng** [三生]; some align with **Rú** teachings, while others seek **xūjìng** [虚寂].

All have explored the **Líshì** [骊室], plucked the **zhūjī** [珠玑], ascended **Zhōngshān** [钟山], and contended to gaze upon the **guīdàn** [圭瓒]. With treasures in hand, they illuminate my mind.

When expounding **inner cultivation**, the **Bāyù Yùxuě** [八玉] shines like mist in the **Dāntián**, and the **Jiǔ Zhuǎn Lánggāo** [九转琅玕] glows in the **Jiànguò**—mastering the subtleties of the **Liùqì** [六气] and achieving the **Wǔlíng Jiāfú** [五灵夹辅]. Forgetting forgetfulness, exhaling exhalation, attaining **wúdé** [无得] while comprehending **Huàyuán** [化元].

When discussing **verification of categories**, they cast off fine dust, transcend the highest ranks, roam beyond the **Bāwài** [八外], and soar above the **Sānjìng** [三境], fulfilling the **Tàiyī** [太一]’s mandate.

Yet none surpass in combining **inner and outer essences**, merging **human and celestial capacities**.

The **Emperor Zhāngshù Xiàohuáng of the Mysterious Sovereign Dao** [我玄宗至道昭肃孝皇帝],
descended as a **Dragon in human form** [降神龙变],
inherited the **Symbolic Mandate** [接统象先],
suppressed the **internal chaos** by harnessing the **Heavenly Stem** [乾], and
initiated the **Mid-Dynasty Revival**, ascending to the throne [御极].

For **forty-five years**, he governed with **Wuwei in its utmost flexibility** [无为在宥],
leaving no trace of toil upon **Fénshuǐ** [汾水] and **Shàngchéng** [襄城].
He gathered **Zhūcí** [具茨] and **Dàwěi** [大隗],
and found companions in his **wandering** [朋游].
He expanded the **Eight Seas** [八溟] into the **Renshou Palace** [仁寿之庭],
and embraced the **Ten Thousand Houses** [万寓] as the realm of **Huàxiū** [华胥].
His **Dao** and **virtue** were supreme and luminous—
exalted and clear beyond compare [超哉明哉].

Revered as **precious as the sacred scriptures** [钦若尊经],
his teachings became the **foundation of the imperial household** [本朝家教].
No **ritual chants** [象击] could match his discourse,
nor **Ode poetry** [风雅] suffice to enumerate his achievements.
He stood **transcendent across ages** [横亘古今],
**self-sufficient within the cosmos** [独立宇宙].

Though all scholars wielded their brushes yet failed to exhaust the **multifarious wonders** [众妙之门],
nor did many a learned man penetrate the **profound depths of Chongxuan** [重玄之境].
With **leisure to refine his adornments** [凝旒多暇],
and **thoughts converging in purpose** [属想有归],
he personally composed **eighty-one chapters** [躬注八十一章]
and drafted **six volumes of commentary** [制疏六卷].

Within, he traced the **principles of the body’s foundation** [循身之本],
and **encompassed all without omission** [囊括无遗].
Without, he articulated the **methods of governing the realm** [理国之方],
and **exhaustively detailed every thread** [洪纤毕举].

His **imperial compositions** [宸藻] spread far and wide,
surpassing the **Five Clouds’ splendor** [夺五云之华],
while **heavenly radiance** [天光] descended upon him,
enhancing the **luster of the Two Illuminations** [增两曜之色].

Indeed, he could rival **Zhì Zhòng’s *Ten Wings*** [季仲《十翼》],
and **illuminate alongside *The Two Souths*** [辉映《二南》].
Had he **personally received instruction from Xuānyuán** [玄元],
or **truly transmitted the teachings of Tàishàng** [太上],
he would have **led all nine schools** [冠九流],
and **emerged first among them** [首出],
leaving an **enduring legacy across the ages** [垂万古而不刊].
Then the **songs of *The Great Wind*** [《大风》] and **the *Red Wild Goose*** [《朱雁》] would **truly be unmatched**;
and the **works of *Discourses on Literature*** [《典论》] and **the *Golden Tower*** [《金楼》] could **never be compared** to his.

Yet within his **commentaries and annotations** [疏注],
he **cited scriptures and harmonized their meanings** [引经合义],
and in the **Chronicles of Zhou** [周书] and **Ru’s Histories** [鲁史],
he **mutually illuminated their insights** [互有发明].
From the **Four Beginnings** [四始] to **Qī Yuán’s Garden** [漆园],
he **expounded their categories** [或申属类].
Later scholars, upon unfolding his scrolls,
often **blindly followed their sources** [瞢本源],
and **pieced together from myriad texts** [探摭众书],
**delving into their passages** [研寻篇轴].
Yet all who **followed their own observations** [随有所见]
**found his works complete and exhaustive** [咸得备书],
thus compiling the **Thirty-Volume *Comprehensive Sacred Teachings*** [纂成《广圣义》三十卷].

The **Great Brightness** [大明] shone above,
yet his **flame of enlightenment** [爝火] never ceased;
the **Great Flood** [巨泽] spread across the heavens,
yet his **transformative influence** [灌浸] never waned.

The truth is, my understanding is limited, and my annotations are crude and incomplete.
In the first year of the **Heavenly Restoration** [天复], on the sixteenth day of the ninth month, **Dragon Gathering** [龙集], on the day **Sin-Wei** [辛酉], **Jia-Zi** [甲子] was the sequence.
**Su Yìngbīn’s Preface** [苏颖滨序]

At the age of forty-two, I was exiled to **Jùn Prefecture** [筠州].
Though Jùn was a small prefecture, it housed many ancient **chan monasteries** [禅剎], where monks from all directions gathered.
There was a **Daoist Master Quán** [道全] residing at **Huángbì Mountain** [黄蘗山], the grandson of **Nán Gōng** [南公].
His conduct was lofty, and his mind was open; he took pleasure in conversing with me.
Once, he spoke with me of the **Dao/Way**, and I told him:
*"What you speak of, I have already found in the Confucian classics."*

Master Quán replied:
*"This is the **Buddha-Dharma**; how could a Confucian have attained it?"*

I said:
*"No, that is not so.
I have indeed heard of the **Dao/Way**—what a Confucian lacks, why forcefully ascribe it to them?
Yet it truly exists, though the world knows it not.
The separation between **Confucianism** and **Buddhism** is like the incomprehension between **Hán** and **Hú** [胡].
How could you know otherwise?"*

Master Quán said:
*"Then speak to me of its essence."*

I said:
*"Confucius’ grandson, **Zǐsī** [子思], wrote *The Doctrine of the Mean* [《中庸》], which states:
*'When **joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** have not yet arisen, this is called **the Middle** [中].
When they arise and are all in due measure, this is called **Harmony** [和].
**The Middle** is the great root of all under heaven.
**Harmony** is the universal **Dao/Way** of all under heaven.
To attain **the Middle and Harmony**, the heavens and earth find their place, and all things are nurtured thereby.'*

How does this accord?
I said:
*'The **Sixth Patriarch** [六祖] spoke: *"Do not ponder goodness, do not ponder evil—this is your original face."
Since the Sixth Patriarch, many have attained enlightenment through these words.
What is meant by *not pondering goodness or evil* is the state before **joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** arise.
**The Middle** is another name for **Buddha-nature** [佛性], while **Harmony** encompasses the **Six Perfections** and **ten thousand practices** [六度万行].
To attain the utmost **Middle and Harmony**, and thus give rise to the heavens, earth, and all things—what **Buddha-Dharma** could surpass this?'*

Master Quán, delighted, exclaimed:
*"I did not know this before! Now I understand that **Confucianism and Buddhism** are one **Dharma**."*

I laughed and said:
*"No, that is not so.
There is but **one Dao/Way** under heaven, yet the means of governing people differ.
Between **sovereign and minister, father and son**, without **rites and laws**, there is chaos.
To know **rites and laws** yet not the **Dao/Way** is the failing of vulgar Confucians, unworthy of esteem.
To dwell in the mountains and forests, eating grain and drinking from streams, yet harboring the **Supreme Dao/Way**, one may become a teacher to both **humans and celestial beings**—yet to govern the world with this would bring disorder.
The ancient **Sages** held the **Dao/Way** in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they be so."*

Master Quán bowed in reverence, saying:
*"This is profound discourse indeed."*

At that time, I was studying the *Laozi*, and whenever I expounded a chapter, I showed it to Master Quán.
He would always exclaim:
*"All of this is the **Buddha’s teaching**!"*

I resided in Jùn for five years before returning north; Master Quán soon passed away.
Now, more than twenty years have passed.
Whenever I revised my *Commentary on the Laozi*, it never failed to align with the **Buddha-Dharma**.
Since no one else could converse with me on this, I longed to see Master Quán again and show it to him.
Thus, I inscribed this at the end of the *Laozi*.

In the second year of **Great Observation** [大观], on the tenth day of the twelfth month, **Zǐyóu** [子由] inscribed this.

In my youth, when I was exiled to **Hǎikāng** [海康], I encountered my elder brother **Zǐzhān** [子瞻] by chance in **Téng Prefecture** [藤州].
We traveled together for over ten days, discussing our past studies.
Zǐzhān said to me:
*"Your works on *Poetry*, the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and *Ancient History* are all beyond what ancient scholars achieved.
Only your *Commentary on the Laozi* falls slightly short."*

Upon arriving in Hǎikāng, with leisure and no other duties, I revised all my writings.
I then recopied the *Laozi* commentary and sent it to Zǐzhān.
Afterward, by imperial favor, I returned north.
Zǐzhān fell ill in **Pílíng** [毗陵] and did not recover.
Now, over ten years have passed, and I still do not know whether he approved of this book.

In the winter of the first year of **Political Harmony** [政和], I received from my nephew **Mài** [迈] and others the compilation of *My Late Father’s Writings* [《先公手泽》].
Among them was this:
*"Yesterday, Zǐyóu sent me *The New Commentary on the Laozi*.
I read it through in one sitting and, closing the volume, sighed deeply.
If this book had existed in the **Warring States**, there would have been no **Shāng Yáng** or **Hán Fēi**.
If it had existed in the **Han’s early years**, **Kǒng** and **Lǎo** would have been one."*

If the **Jìn-Sòng** era had possessed this book, then **Buddha and Lao** would not have been two.

Little did I expect that in my old age I would encounter such singular brilliance—only then did I realize this book must have pleased **Zǐzhān**.

Yet in my ten years residing in **Topless Creek** [顽川], I further revised these four books.
For the words of the Sage are not fully grasped in a single reading; thus, whenever I gained new insight, I dared not treat my earlier interpretations as final.
Today, I have added to my old age, and I consider myself content.

I wished to consult **Zǐzhān** further, but it was impossible—so here, I weep and sigh.

**Zhào Shí’s Preface:**

The **Húnchéng** [混成] essence is veiled in **silent stillness**.
The daily practice centers on the **Qi-Mother** [气母].
Above form, it transcends the **None**—the **None** is where all is hidden and nonexistent.
Below, it follows the **Law** and embraces the **Having**—the **Having** is where all is balanced and coexistent.
To guard well is to secure the **land of no-death**; to grasp **One** is to pierce the **divine mechanism**.

Originally, there is no preference—those who emulate form are like the **Unslaughtered** [不宰], who claim no action.
**Creation’s work** is naturally bestowed; its operation through the ten thousand things makes the **Dao** neither approach nor depart.
The **Mandate of Heaven** is called the **Divine Vessel**, yet it cannot be seized—its attainment lies within oneself, and its **virtue** may be **rén** or **yì**.

To assist the world, one must value **purity and clarity**, yet it cannot be swayed.
The **Dao** is not difficult—seek it simply, and you attain the **mystery of the rare and subtle**, where divine transformations are unfathomable.
The **Dao** is not easy—delve into its **silent depths**, flowing into the realms of **movement and stillness**; its truth is both revealed and concealed, thus the **Two** merge into **One**, observable as such.

Though **family and state** follow divergent paths, they should align in **unified principle**.
Indeed, these two chapters establish the **foundation of virtue and power**, their **ninefold divisions** mirroring the **six yang essences**.
Refining the **pure yin** in the **furnace of fire**, the **Heavenly Dao** blends—thus the world rests in **non-action**, and the **Sage-ruler** takes it as model.

Does it not say in the **Classics**:
*"He who attains the Dao rules as **Emperor above**, and as **King below**;
He who loses the Dao is seen as **light above**, and as **soil below**."*

To comprehend this **Dao**, one must do so with the **heart**.
To pierce the **true womb** is to err in **artifice**.
If such is the case, then what should one uphold?
**Serene and unadorned**, it comes without seeking.
What should one attain?
**Action and conduct** follow without being summoned.

The **Ancient Sovereigns** governed the world without knowing the **Dao**—thus the **Dao** was **non-action**.
In the **declining Zhou**, they skillfully guided the world, yet the **Dao** was unknown—**rén** and **yì** could not be shifted.
This is why my teacher entrusted it to **Yīn Jūn**, and **Zhuāng and Liè** further illuminated it for the age.

Though **rén** and **yì** can govern the world, the world’s disorder lies in their **infrequency**.
Though **virtue and power** can harmonize the times, the times’ **hypocrisy** stems from their **neglect**.
The **highest and brightest Dao** thus resides with the **Sage**.

The **Middle Way** is never abandoned in this intent.
The **Upper Scripture** says:
*"What can be spoken of and named is not my constant Dao and constant Name."*
Thus, it is **hidden and difficult to discern**.

If one separates **superior virtue and superior righteousness**, distinguishing **non-action** from **action**, how could it be **reckless and unchecked**?
The **Three Sovereigns** skillfully employed it—**all day long, never departing**;
The **Five Emperors** could inherit it—**serving Heaven with distinction**.
In later ages, the **coarse and shallow** lost it through human failing.

The *Yì* says:
*"The **Creative** is easy to know, the **Receptive** is simple to practice."*
Only by practicing the **simple and easy Dao** does one align with the **principle of pure clarity**.

If so, then how can there be **order and chaos** in governing the world?

Truly, as **Gāigōng** said:
*"Governance values pure clarity*—this is the intent behind the **Two Chapters on Virtue and Power**."

Written on **Upper Element Day**, **Rénshēn Year** of **Shàoxīng** [绍兴], at the **Jùchán Hall**.
**Huáng Mǎocái’s Preface**.

The Dao of Laozi sought to ride the clouds and qi, to ascend and bend the boundless,
to gaze beyond the eight wilds, deeming human affairs unworthy to weigh upon his mind.
Yet now his text speaks much of governing the state and loving the people,
of wielding armies and leading troops, descending even to the minutiae of carriages and tools—
indeed, it is mostly metaphorical speech.

Laozi and Zhuangzi are one. One knows Zhuangzi’s use of metaphor,
yet does not know it originated from Laozi.
Thus, readers of *Laozi* often miss its true intent.
*Laozi* says:
*"Know its masculine, hold to its feminine."*
Again:
*"The spirit of the Valley does not die—this is called the mysterious female."*
Again:
*"And yet, it prizes seeking nourishment from the Mother."*
Why does *Laozi* value the feminine, the female, and the Mother?
All are metaphorical speech.
Among the eighty-one chapters, such cases are not few—
yet he wished to align with Confucius and Mencius’ Six Classics,
so it was inevitable that their meanings would clash.

I have pondered this text for many years,
devoted to exploring Laozi’s intent,
and composed annotations to clarify it.
Where my understanding was incomplete,
I drew upon *Liezi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Yijing*,
and other Daoist writings,
hoping to pierce the chaos of darkness,
to dissect the vast and formless,
so that those who come after may grasp its truth.

**Xie Tunan’s Preface**:
The Dao has its scriptures, ancient in origin.
Before the union of the blue ox and purple breath,
before the opening of the jade [□] and golden keys,
there were already the Five Thousand Words,
revealing the secrets of the Primordial,
expounding the subtle essence of the Fallen.
Mysterious beyond measure, divine beyond reckoning—
only those on the Dao can truly know it.

*Laozi*’s eighty-one chapters,
its words also numbering Five Thousand,
are the continuation of its lineage,
flowing together in harmony—
truly, all are the natural expression of the Dao.
Extending it further,
one refines the self to govern the state,
governs the state to pacify the world—
and the Dao of governance is fulfilled.
Pursuing it deeper,
one refines the self to cultivate the spirit,
cultivates the spirit to ascend—
and the Dao of transcendence is fulfilled.

Zhang Ping’s verse says:
*The *Yinshu* treasure exceeds three hundred,*
*the *Daode*’s sacred words are but Five Thousand.*
*Since ancient times, the divine and immortal are boundless,*
*all spring from here, the true path revealed.*
Did Ping deceive me?
Though the *signs* are tools to catch fish,
the *scriptures* are paths to enter the Dao—
fish caught, the *signs* may be forgotten;
the Dao understood, the *scriptures* are but temporary guides.

To recite the words of ancient sages
yet fail to grasp their unspoken meaning
is still of no benefit.

*The Huangting Neijing* says:
*"The divine and immortal are not born with inherent spirit—*
*they accumulate essence and amass merit to attain true reality."*
Again:
*"Accumulating merit to refine is not natural—*
*it comes from devotion, from focus and perseverance."*
The Daoist scholar who devotes his heart
to essence and focus, enduring without falter,
has never failed to succeed.
Yet he fears the reverence not reaching its peak,
or arrogance and neglect taking hold,
or faith not being steadfast,
or carelessness following in its wake.
This is why, among a thousand, only one or two may attain it.

In antiquity, the Yellow Emperor received the *Yinshu*’s intent from Guangcheng Huangren,
and wept in gratitude.
General Yan, the Keeper of the Pass, heard the marvels of *Daode* from Li Laojun,
and wept in reverence, bowing.
Why did they weep?
Their joy and awe were profound, their gratitude intense.
Yet if this text is so difficult to see,
and its meaning so hard to grasp,
we must bow a hundred times to recite it,
guard it all our lives,
treasure it as the greatest of gems,
cherish it as the Primordial Qi—
let us not neglect it,
let us not abandon it.

**Yu Qiongzhong’s Second Preface**, written on **Upper Element Day**, **Renshen Year** of **Chunyu** [淳佑],
at the **Lian Mountain Celestial Nectar Child**’s **Jingtai Hall**.

**Yu Qingzhong’s Preface**:
The great source of the Dao arises from Heaven.
Heaven cannot speak for itself,
so it depends upon those who can speak to proclaim it,
and only then does the Dao’s form emerge.

If there were no one to speak of it,
then the Dao would remain forever concealed.
Does Heaven wish the Dao to remain concealed forever?
Those who can speak of it are rare—
one in a hundred ages.
If our Laozi is such a rare one,
then Heaven entrusted this Dao to his person.
The body is the Dao’s vessel.
The Dao is embodied in the person,
and expressed in words—
thus the secrets of Heaven and Earth are revealed,
and the mechanisms of creation are disclosed.

Then there are the *scriptures*,
which record the words,
and the words carry the Dao—
the Five Thousand Words are all the Dao.
In truth, they do not depart from one essence,
scattered through the eighty-one chapters—
all are the Dao.
Nor do they stray beyond this one essence—
its refined aspects govern the heart,
its coarse aspects govern the body,
its earthly and mundane aspects govern the world and state—
all stem from this single Dao’s extension.

Since the rise of specialized schools,
each upholds its own truths,
each rejects its own falsehoods.
Zi Yun was scorned for his dismissal,
Ban Gu was criticized for his harshness—
thus my *scripture* was long consigned
to the ranks of the debased and the heretical,
yet none considered that though the names of the Three Teachings differ,
their principles are one.

In ancient times, Su Huangmen annotated this text
and entrusted it to Dongpo.
Dongpo said:
*"Had this text existed in the Warring States,*
*then there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei;*
*had it existed at the beginning of the Han,*
*then Confucius and Laozi would have been one;*
*had it existed in the Jin-Song period,*
*then Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two."*
Could this not diminish the study of heresy?

I admire the Celestial Dynasty,
which honors and upholds sacred teachings,
supports and nurtures human order.
All Daoist writings were burned by imperial decree,
yet the *Daode* alone stands firm,
radiant in the world,
like the sun shining in Heaven—
is this not Heaven’s will?

Though the music of Zheng and Wei was discarded,
the *Shao* grew more revered;
though the tiles lay in ruins,
the pearls became more visible.
Heaven’s intent is clear.

Heaven did not conceal this Dao in the past,
but now reveals it grandly,
wishing that this text be held by families,
and its meaning grasped by people.
Yet all possess this text,
yet few can speak of it,
and even fewer can embody it in their hearts—
what use are mere words?

「For words are the means to convey meaning,
and once meaning is grasped, words may be forgotten.

How many have recited or expounded upon it through the ages?
How many have annotated it from beginning to end?
Yet none could forget words—all failed in this.

Some gained here but lost there,
some took its coarse aspects while neglecting its essence.
In the end, none could fully grasp the complete intent of one school,
nor dispel the doubts of a thousand years.

I, in humility, have taken what was already spoken,
and sought to reveal what was not yet spoken,
supporting my arguments with authoritative *jing* and *zhuàn* texts,
grounding my discussions in the teachings of the scholars.
I have thus titled it *Daode Jing Ji Yi* [《道德經集義》],
not daring to claim novelty from predecessors,
for the principles of the world are boundless—
the more one seeks, the more one finds.
I wish that Master Lao could revive,
and find no cause for regret.

As for the crime of presumption,
I dare not evade it.

All who share my aspirations,
examine and refine this work,
must surely dream of the Blue Ox Master
ascending from the thousand-year past.

*Daode Zhenjing Ji Yi* [《道德真經集義》] **Great Outline and Preface of the Collected Meanings**
*Daode Zhenjing Ji Yi* [《道德真經集義》] **Central Volume of the Collected Meanings**」

The Venerable Master Yǒngyuǎn often resided at the Xuanmiao Guan of the Great Dao/Virtue Path, where the overseer of the Hall of the Moon, Liu Weiyong, compiled this work. The former Grand Secretary and acting Registrar of the Treasury Bureau, also an editor at the Secretariat, Ding Yidong of Shitan, and Du Guangting, undertook the interpretation of this *jing*.

The text is divided into two major sections:
First, the *zhìcù* (制疏) is elucidated, then the main text is explained.

Now, the origin of the *zhìcù* is recounted:
In the leisure of his reign, the Great Tang Emperor Xuanzong pondered the profound Dao/Virtue, recognizing it as the primordial root of heaven and earth. Master Lao, the Most August Ancestor of the Mysterious Origin, expounded upon the two *jing* texts, their teachings enduring across ages—originating from the time of Shun, transmitted through the Zhou dynasty, and annotated by over sixty scholars in commentaries and elucidations.

When discussing governance, the teachings of the Yan family and the Duke of Lu, as well as Yang Xún’s personal insights, stand unparalleled. For personal cultivation, the *Songling* and *Xiang’er* traditions remain unmatched in their subtlety.

Among them, Emperor Wu of Liang, Emperor Jianwen, the monk Sengzhao, and the translators Luo Ran, Zang, Tao, and Gu, all flourished in the Southern Dynasties. Ren, Li, and the two Zhangs shone in Western Shu. Yet despite their contributions, some interpretations were flawed, and none fully penetrated the essence.

Thus, in the eleventh year of the Kaiyuan era, the Emperor personally annotated and elucidated the text. Having completed the account of the *zhìcù*, the explanation of the main text follows, divided into two parts: first, clarifying the *cù* (疏) title, and second, analyzing the text itself.

The subsequent exposition is structured into two major divisions of the *cù*:
First, the opening chapter is interpreted, summarizing the overarching themes, further divided into two:
1. The method of exposition—namely, the two characters *Dao* and *De*.
2. The teaching that expounds it—the single character *jing*.

The full interpretation follows; distinctions within the *jing* title will be addressed later.

These two characters, *Dao* and *De*, encompass the origin of all things, the subtle principles of governing the state and cultivating oneself—all are contained herein.

Formerly, the Daoist Master Ge Xuan addressed Sun Quan, ruler of Wu, saying:
*The Daode Jing* is the utmost subtlety of heaven and earth. It encompasses the Dao/Virtue of heaven, the Dao/Virtue of humanity, and the Dao/Virtue of the divine. It is boundless in its scope, minute in its reach—worthy of reverence.

Within this framework, thirty-eight distinct teachings are outlined:

1. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern through *wuwei* (無為):**
   The *jing* states: *"Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—benefit to humanity is a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—humanity returns to filial piety and affection."*
   *"Abandon cleverness, discard profit—thieves and robbers will cease to exist."*
   Again: *"How can one love people and govern the state without *wuwei*?"*
   *"I practice *wuwei*, yet people transform themselves."*

2. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world:**
   The *jing* states: *"Cultivate the Dao/Virtue in the world, and its power will be universal."*
   *"Hold fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present."*
   *"Hold fast to the Great Image, and all under heaven will follow."*

3. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to govern with the Dao/Virtue:**
   The *jing* states: *"Govern the world with the Dao/Virtue—its spirits will not be numinous. Not that its spirits are not numinous, but that they will not harm people."*
   *"When the Dao/Virtue is absent in the world, warhorses arise at the borders."*

4. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to act in accordance with heaven:**
   The *jing* states: *"Humanity follows the earth; the earth follows the heavens."*
   *"The Dao/Virtue constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone. If lords and kings can uphold this, all things will transform of their own accord."*

5. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to disdain the world due to his exalted status:**
   The *jing* states: *"Hold the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world. Love the body as precious as the world—thus it may be entrusted with the world."*
   *"How can one who rules a myriad chariots treat the world lightly? To treat it lightly is to lose ministers; to be hasty is to lose the mandate."*

6. **Teaching the Son of Heaven not to exalt the worthy nor treasure wealth:**
   The *jing* states: *"Do not exalt the worthy—thus people will not contend. Do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth—thus people will not become thieves."*
   *"Desire what is undesired; do not treasure difficult-to-obtain wealth."*

7. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to transform people through *wuwei* and *wuyu* (無欲):**
   The *jing* states: *"Always keep people in a state of ignorance and desirelessness—thus the wise will not dare to act. To act in *wuwei* is to govern without fail."*
   *"I have no affairs, yet people prosper. I have no desires, yet people return to simplicity."*
   *"By desirelessness and stillness, the world will rectify itself."*

8. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to view all things impartially and not be entangled in achievements:**
   The *jing* states: *"Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat all things as fodder for the dogs. The Sage is not benevolent—they treat the people as fodder for the dogs."*
   *"Practice teaching without words."*
   *"Act without relying on it; when the deed is done, take no credit."*

9. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to hold nothing fast nor be obstructed:**
   The *jing* states: *"To act is to ruin; to grasp is to lose."*
   *"Abandon excess, abandon extravagance, abandon excessiveness."*
   *"The Sage has no fixed heart—taking the hearts of the people as their own."*

10. **Teaching the Son of Heaven to found governance on humility:**
    The *jing* states: *"The noble takes the lowly as root; the high takes the low as foundation."*
    *"The seas and rivers reign over all valleys because they excel in descending."*
    *"Bear the filth of the state—this is the master of the ancestral altars. Bear the misfortunes of the state—this is the king of the world."*
    *"Great states should act as the lowly. Thus they take the small states."*
    *"The good ruler employs people as the lowly."*

11. **Teaching the feudal lords to govern rightly:**
    The *jing* states: *"Govern with rectitude."*
    *"To govern with wisdom is the ruin of the state. Not to govern with wisdom is the blessing of the state."*
    *"The difficulty of governing the people lies in their many clever schemes—thus they are difficult to govern."*

12. **Teaching the feudal lords to avoid harsh and violent rule:**
    The *jing* states: *"To govern a great state is like poaching a small fish. The more the court is frequented, the more the fields lie fallow. The more the granaries are filled, the more the people suffer hunger."*

「Again it states: *"If his governance is meticulous, his people will be deficient."*」

**13. Teaching the feudal lords to assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way and not to rely on military prowess:**
The *jing* states: *"Assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way, do not use force of arms to dominate the world."*
*"Force of arms will not prevail."*
*"The good warrior conquers without contention."*
*"Though there be armor and weapons, there is no place to display them."*
*"Let people return to knotting cords and simple tools."*

**14. Teaching the feudal lords to uphold the Dao/Way and transform the people:**
The *jing* states: *"The ancients who excelled as gentlemen were subtle, mysterious, and profound in their understanding."*
*"If his governance is obscure, his people will be pure."*

**15. Teaching the feudal lords not to trifle with arms or indulge in martial aggression:**
The *jing* states: *"When using arms, one must say: 'I dare not be the aggressor, but only the defender; I dare not advance even an inch, but retreat even a foot.'*
*"He who resists arms with compassion will prevail."*
*"No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy."*
*"The good warrior does not rely on force."*
*"Drive away the unarmed, seize without weapons."*
*"The virtue of non-contention."*

**16. Teaching the feudal lords not to indulge in licentiousness and extravagance, to lighten taxes and burdens, and to nourish the people:**
The *jing* states: *"The people’s hunger arises from their rulers consuming too much in taxes—thus they starve."*
*"When the people are many in clever schemes, strange things flourish."*

**17. Teaching the feudal lords not to display their advantageous weapons:**
The *jing* states: *"Fish cannot be taken from the depths without harming the pool; a state possessing advantageous weapons should not display them to the people."*
*"The ancients who excelled in the Dao/Way did not seek to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them in simplicity."*

**18. Teaching to govern the state and cultivate oneself, honoring the Three Treasures:**
The *jing* says: *"I possess Three Treasures; preserve and uphold them.
The first is kindness, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to lead the world."*

**19. Teaching to cultivate oneself, yielding to preserve wholeness, embracing softness to prevail:**
The *jing* states: *"Yielding preserves wholeness."*
*"Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength."*
*"The soft and weak are the companions of life."*
*"The hard and strong are the companions of death."*
*"The overbearing will not meet their end."*

**20. Teaching to govern oneself, acting without action and desiring without desire:**
The *jing* states: *"Always without desire, observe its subtlety."*
*"See no desirable gain, and the heart will not be disturbed."*

**21. Teaching to govern oneself, preserving the Dao and nurturing the *qi* to complete one’s life:**
The *jing* states: *"Bring emptiness to its utmost, hold steadfastness with sincerity."*
*"Focus the *qi* to achieve softness."*
*"Feed the belly, not the eyes—discard the former, embrace the latter."*
*"Know its brilliance, guard its darkness."*
*"Know its male, guard its female."*
*"Continuous as if it exists, yet used without exhaustion."*

**22. Teaching to govern oneself, elevating virtue and discarding vice:**
The *jing* states: *"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises.
When all under heaven know goodness as goodness, then evil arises."*
*"The consistently virtuous save people without abandoning anyone, save things without discarding anything."*
*"The virtuous person is the teacher of the non-virtuous."*
*"Dull their sharpness, untangle their confusion."*
*"The highest virtue is like water."*

**23. Teaching to govern oneself, accumulating virtue as the foundation:**
The *jing* states: *"The depth of virtue that is contained."*
*"The highest virtue is like the valley."*
*"The great man dwells in substance, not in superficiality, and resides in reality, not in ornament."*
*"The gentleman walks all day without straying from his essential burdens."*

**24. Teaching to govern oneself, diligently applying the Dao/Way:**
The *jing* states: *"The superior man, hearing the Dao/Way, is earnest and puts it into practice."*
*"Brave in not daring, he remains alive."*

**25. Teaching to govern oneself, abandoning fame and achievement, not indulging in worldly learning:**
The *jing* states: *"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries."*
*"When achievement and reputation are complete, withdraw from the world."*
*"Do not dwell on achievement."*
*"Practice the Dao/Way daily, diminishing it."*
*"Which is dearer: reputation or life?"*

**26. Teaching to govern oneself, not coveting worldly gain:**
The *jing* states: *"Which is more: life or wealth? Which is more harmful: possession or loss?"*
*"The more one cherishes, the greater the expenditure; the more one hoards, the greater the loss."*
*"Hard-to-obtain wealth causes one to act against propriety."*

**27. Teaching to govern oneself, avoiding external entanglements and not flaunting one’s abilities:**
The *jing* states: *"Not self-displaying, one becomes clear.
Not self-praising, one has merit.
Not self-exalting, one endures long."*
*"Great eloquence seems stammering; great skill seems clumsy."*
*"Ample virtue appears insufficient."*
*"Great sound is rare in tone."*
*"He who conquers himself is strong."*

**28. Teaching to govern oneself, not seeking honor and favor:**
The *jing* states: *"Honor and disgrace are like a sudden alarm."*
*"To grasp and fill is not as good as to let go.
To sharpen and whet cannot be long preserved."*
*"Riches and nobility with arrogance bring their own retribution."*

**29. Teaching to govern oneself, having little knowledge and speaking cautiously:**
The *jing* states: *"To know one’s ignorance is superior; to not know one’s knowledge is a disease."*
*"Much speech leads to exhaustion; better to hold to the middle."*
*"Light promises bring few trustworthy deeds; many changes bring many difficulties."*
*"Close its openings, shut its doors—then it will not weary throughout life."*

**30. Teaching those who leave the world, the Dao/Way is the opposite of the common ways:**
The *jing* states: *"The people are bright and clear, but I alone seem dull.
The people are meticulous, but I alone am obscure."*
*"Clarifying the Dao/Way seems like obscurity; advancing the Dao/Way seems like retreat."*

**31. Teaching those who leave the world, to nourish the spirit and thus not die:***
The *jing* states: *"Nourish the spirit, and it will not die."*

The *jing* states:
*"The spirit of the valley does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Feminine."*
*"Deep roots and firm foundations—
the Dao/Way of long life and enduring vision."*
*"Well-established, it cannot be uprooted;
well-embraced, it cannot slip away."*

**32. Teaching one to preserve life, attaining longevity without perishing:**
The *jing* states:
*"To die yet not perish is longevity."*

**33. Teaching one to cultivate the self, transcending the body through non-action:**
The *jing* states:
*"Place yourself behind your body, and your body will lead;
Transcend your body, and your body will endure."*

**34. Teaching one to regulate the heart, emptying the mind to align with the Dao/Way:**
The *jing* states:
*"Empty your mind,
Weaken your will."*

**35. Teaching one to conduct oneself in the world, harmonizing one’s brilliance with all things:**
The *jing* states:
*"Harmonize your light with the dust of the world."*
*"The Great Dao/Way is vast—
how can it be confined to left or right?"*
*"Wearing coarse robes while cherishing jade."*

**36. Teaching one to abandon excess desires, cultivating awe, caution, humility, and luminous virtue:**
The *jing* states:
*"The five colors blind the eyes;
The five tones deafen the ears;
The five flavors dull the palate;
Hunting and galloping make the heart deranged."*
*"If the people do not fear authority, then great terror will come."*

**37. Teaching one to enrich the many and benefit the few:**
The *jing* states:
*"Use your abundance to supply what is lacking."*
*"The more you give to others, the more you possess;
The more you benefit others, the more you gain."*

**38. Teaching one to embody the Dao/Way and cultivate the self, ensuring inevitable reward:**
The *jing* states:
*"Traveling on land, you do not encounter rhinoceros or tigers;
Entering battle, you are unharmed by weapons."*
*"Because you dwell in the place of no death."*

These thirty-eight distinctions elucidate the *jing*’s profound teachings.
Yet this *jing* is vast—encompassing all without exclusion,
and minute—penetrating to the finest hairs.
These thirty-eight gates do not exhaust its essence.
To preserve its doctrine, I broadly outline its core principles,
yet even this is like comparing autumnal hairs to a millionth of their truth.

The *Rites of Zhou* states:
*"The Dao/Way is that which cannot be absent for a moment;
what can be absent is not the Dao/Way."*

If a ruler lacks virtue/power,
it is like gazing without two eyes.
If a minister lacks virtue/power,
it is like a chest without five organs.
If a household lacks virtue/power,
it is like a corpse without breath.

Thus, the Dao/Way is indispensable to humanity.
If one abandons spoken teachings and absolute silence,
and points to the Mysterious Feminine beyond the Mysterious Feminine,
the subtlest of the subtle—
this can be illuminated by the spirit,
yet cannot be conveyed by words.
This is the ultimate of the Dao/Way.

Wang Yuanze says:
*"The Dao/Way is one.
Yet its explanations are two."*

What then are these two?

One is *wu* (無)—the root of the Dao/Way, the very essence of the subtle.
The other is *you* (有)—the manifestation of the Dao/Way, the expedient and practical.

Thus, the root of the Dao/Way emerges from the boundless void of the profound and obscure,
while its manifestation disperses through the forms, names, measures, and numbers of the world.
These two, though one in essence,
are often mistaken by the deluded as separate—why?
Because the boundless void and the profound obscure abide in *wu*,
while forms, names, measures, and numbers abide in *you*.
Since *wu* and *you* cannot coexist,
this is why the deluded fail to grasp their unity.

*Wu* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
while *you* is named the mother of all things.
Though their names differ,
they never cease to serve one another.
For *wu* and *you* are like east and west—opposite yet inseparable.
Thus, without *you*, *wu* cannot be perceived,
and without *wu*, *you* cannot emerge.
The interplay of *wu* and *you* alternates in succession,
yet never departs from the Dao/Way—
this is what the sages call the *shen* (神, numinous).

The *Yijing* says:
*"Without thought, without action,
serene and unmoving,
yet responsive and thus harmonizing with all under Heaven."*
This is what is meant.

Of old, the sages would observe the subtle constancy through their *wu* (無思無為),
and perceive the expedient through their responsive harmony with all under Heaven.
When both the subtle and the expedient are attained without partiality,
who but the numinous could comprehend this?

Thus, the Dao/Way of the sages is now revealed.
To observe the subtle is to fathom the numinous,
while to observe the expedient is to know transformation.
To fathom the numinous and know transformation—
what more could be added to the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth?

Yet, to observe the subtle is merely to fathom the numinous,
not to be the numinous itself.
For the numinous never departs from these two,
nor are these two sufficient to be named.
Thus it is said: *"The two share a source but differ in name.
Their unity lies in their origin from the numinous,
while their difference lies in the names of *wu* and *you*."*

The sage embodies this and manifests virtue through the numinous,
so dwelling in *wu* suffices to reveal the subtle,
while dwelling in *you* suffices to know the expedient—
yet ultimately transcending the names of *wu* and *you*.
In this, the highest knows the origin of Heaven and Earth,
and the lowest responds to the beginning of all things—
all through this.

Ah! The words of Laozi can be said to align with the *Yijing*.
Yet he ultimately cannot stand with Confucius and Mencius—why?
Because the sage, when speaking of the Dao/Way, never sought to articulate it.
All that was spoken of emerged in response to the transformations of the world,
and was meant only for those of mediocre talent who could not comprehend on their own.
Though the Dao/Way encompasses both *wu* and *you*,
when spoken of, it emphasizes *you* while neglecting *wu*.
For the texts of the *Shijing*, *Shujing*, *Liji*, *Yueji*, and *Chunqiu*
all serve to elucidate *you*.
As for *wu*, only the *Yijing* speaks of it—
yet even then, its teachings are embedded in the lines, symbols, and judgments,
in the auspicious and inauspicious, the regrets and cautions,
so that the learned, observing from above, see the detailed particulars of things
and grasp their *you*,
while the unlearned, observing from below, perceive the transcendence of instruments and uses
and grasp their *wu*.
Thus, the wise grow ever more confident in their understanding,
while the foolish, though glimpsing it, do not fall into doubt or error.

For others have pondered: *"The subtle Dao/Way is beyond the reach of mediocre minds.
Those who can grasp it need not speak—it reveals itself.
If one fails to measure it thus and insists on speaking of the subtle,
then one only confuses the learners."*

Laozi understood that *wu* and *you* serve one another,
and that *wu* is the root, so his words elaborate on *wu* while omitting *you*.
Yet *wu* is beyond speech—how can it be elaborated upon?
Since Laozi already diverged from Confucius and Mencius,
Rong Zhi further lost the essence of Confucius.
For he claimed that *wu* (無) is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
and that the *shen* (神) is the most difficult to name of Heaven and Earth—
yet the world has already named it *shen*.
But is there truly anything without a name?
Again, he believed that one must observe the expedient through desire,
yet great desire is the harm of nature.
The *Yijing* says: *"Restrain anger, suppress desire,"*
and Laozi also says: *"Do not see what is desirable, lest the heart be disturbed."*
If desire exists, one will sink, stray, and lose oneself in pursuing things,
unable to know what to hold onto—
how then can one observe the expedient?
This failure to discern leads him to say, *"I know the completeness of Heaven and Earth,
the grand framework of the ancients"*—
alas, how laughable!

Liu Zhongping said:
*"The constant name is *wu* (無方) as its essence,
the constant Dao/Way is *wu* (無體) as its function.
*Wu* (無方) is without boundaries—nowhere is it not present;
*wu* (無體) is without form—nothing is beyond its doing.
If there is anything it does, then it is not *wu* (無方);
if there is anything it names, then it is not *wu* (無體).
Thus it is said: *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;
the name that can be named is not the constant name.’*

At the beginning of the Great Origin, there was *wu* and *you*,
and *wu* was without name.
That which was *wu* and without name—this was the Great Commencement.
The Great Commencement is the father of Heaven and Earth,
so it is said: *‘The unnamed is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.’*
Heaven and Earth are the mothers of all things,
so it is said: *‘The named is the mother of all things.’*
To speak of the mother is to know the father of the beginning,
while to speak of the beginning is to know the mother as the source of life.
Thus, above it is said: *‘the beginning of Heaven and Earth,’*
and below it is said: *‘the mother of all things.’*"*

「Yet the principles of the world, there is the Dao/Way and the constant Dao/Way,
there is the name and the constant name.

What is called *‘the Great Origin has wu and you’* is simply *wu*.
What is called *‘wu has wu-ming’* is simply *you*-ming.

For indeed, there is *wu* and *you*, and thus there is the named *you*.
Hence, *wu-ming* is merely *‘the Great Origin of Heaven and Earth.’*

But above this, there is also the *zu* (祖).
The subtle (*miao* 妙) is the root of the Dao/Way,
the coarse (*jiao* 徼) is the end of the Dao/Way.
The sage’s subtlety, observing it with *constant wu*,
the sage’s coarseness, observing it with *constant you*.

Thus it is said: *‘Constant wu to observe its subtlety,
constant you to observe its coarseness.’*
The subtle lies within, the coarse without,
speaking of the subtle reveals the coarse as coarse,
speaking of the coarse reveals the subtle as within.
Hence, above it is said: *‘constant wu to observe its subtlety,’*
and below it is said: *‘constant you to observe its coarseness.’*

For *wu* is *wu* opposed to *you*,
while *constant wu* is not *wu* opposed to *wu*, nor is it *you* opposed to it;
*you* opposed to *wu* is *you* that is not *wu*,
while *constant you* is not *you* opposed to *you*, nor is it *wu* opposed to it.
That which is not *wu* opposed is not *you*,
that which is not *you* opposed is not *wu*.
Thus, *constant you* is the true *wu* in essence, yet not *wu*,
and *constant wu* is the subtle *you* in essence, yet not *you*—
hence these two are the profound *‘same origin, same return’* (同出而同归).

Zhuangzi said: *‘Establish it with constant wu-you,
speak of it with the Great Oneness (Tai Yi 太一).’*
For indeed, *‘constant wu-you’* (周读) is read as *‘constant wu, constant you.’*
Constant *wu* is to observe its subtlety,
constant *you* is to observe its coarseness.
Because one observes its subtlety, it is established with constant *wu*,
because one observes its coarseness, it is established with constant *you*.
If one speaks of the coarse and subtle as *‘forgetting and without desire to observe,’*
then what is called *‘establish it with constant wu-you’* is simply *‘obscured in mystery’* (冥之).

This is called *‘yet more profound’* (又玄),
not merely the same as called *‘profound’* (玄),
but *‘profound yet again profound’* (玄之又玄),
the gateway to all subtleties.

The profound is the essence of subtlety,
the subtle is the manifestation of the profound.
The subtle is the same origin as that which is not profound.
Liu Ji (刘骥) humbly believes that Laozi’s discourse on *virtue/power* and *Dao/Way* (道德),
arising from Guan Yin’s (关尹) request,
was spoken extemporaneously and written in haste,
never divided into ninety chapters.

Later scholars split it into two volumes,
symbolizing the subtle and manifest uses of the Two Principles (两仪),
and eighty-one chapters (九九八十一),
corresponding to the ultimate number of the Great One (太阳).
Now let it be restored as one.

The two teachings are named *‘Comprehensive Doctrine’* (通论),
yet the mind is perplexed and cannot comprehend,
the mouth is baffled and cannot discuss.
Vast and boundless, it cannot be described or contained.
Its first chapter begins with *‘The Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*
to show that the Dao/Way cannot be sought with reasoning.
Its final chapter ends with *‘What cannot be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way,’*
to show that the Dao/Way cannot be transmitted through words.

Difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom,
difficult to measure, difficult to recognize,
looking up, it grows ever higher,
pursuing it, it grows ever more distant.
One might think it like ascending to Heaven—
seemingly unattainable.

Yet its essential meaning is no more than
attaining *extreme emptiness* (虚极),
and steadfastly preserving *profound stillness* (守静笃).
It is very easy to know, very easy to practice.
Yet none in the world can know it,
none can practice it,
to open its *yue* (兑) and aid its affairs.

The ancient masters who excelled in the Dao/Way
sealed their *yue* (兑),
closed their gates,
shattered their theories,
dissolved their confusion,
their minds undisturbed,
they dwelled in the Dao,
returning to the root of *emptiness and stillness*,
recovering the origin of *nature and life* (性命).
Just as all things arise from the root and return to the root,
returning to the root and recovering life,
nurturing *nature* (性) and reflecting *virtue/power* (德),
when *virtue/power* is attained, it aligns with the beginning,
returning to the *pu* (朴),
in harmony with the Dao’s essence,
*‘boundless yet without form’* (绳绳兮不可名),
returning to *wu-wu* (无物),
neither born nor extinguished,
neither self nor name,
life and death within oneself,
entering and exiting without obstruction.
Thus, it is neither seen nor unseen,
neither revealed nor concealed,
neither close nor distant,
neither beneficial nor harmful,
neither honored nor humiliated—
and so it can abandon things and transcend people,
rising beyond Heaven and Earth’s
yin-yang cycles and cosmic measures.

Great indeed are the most virtuous sages and divine persons—
none can reach them without this gate.
What is known is difficult to speak,
what is practiced is seen with the eyes,
yet its power is vast while its function is profound.
The students must silently recognize and deeply cultivate it.

If one does not deeply cultivate and attain it oneself,
but seeks it through scrutiny,
or investigates it through debate,
it is like sitting in a well to observe the sky—
how could one hope to glimpse the Dao/Way’s *‘approximate likeness’* (仿髴)?

Zhao Shi’an (赵实庵) said:
The subtle Dao/Way is boundless and empty,
establishing teaching before Heaven’s manifestation,
the most true symbolizing the ultimate,
the Dragon Han (龙汉) opening the diagram,
the lineage of teachers transmitting the transformation—
to the Three (三).
The cycles of *kalpa* (劫) intertwined—
to the Nine (九).

At the *Tai Ji* (太极),
the primordial unity was first analyzed,
Heaven and Earth opened, affairs simplified, people pure—
the Three Sovereigns (三皇) acted,
instituting tools and symbols,
without contrivance or artifice—
what was there of ritual and etiquette?

As the *kalpa* declined,
purity was scattered,
though scriptures were not yet composed,
and the profound teachings had not yet shone forth.
The initial profound words were first bestowed upon *You Yu* (有虞),
and completed in the age of governance.
The Golden Mouth (金口) transmitted them to the *Ji* (姬) lineage,
making the profound chapters widely manifest.
Though passed down through a hundred kings,
they were also personally transmitted to *Guan Ling* (关令).

In the time of Emperor Ming (明皇),
his imperial commentary was issued by decree,
preserved in the *Wei Temple* (徽庙),
a grand tradition of the sage’s words illuminating our lineage.
At the time, all revered it,
as if in the *Qi* (始青) era,
with blessings extending through generations,
permanently bright and unbroken.

As for the annotations and commentaries of a hundred schools,
piled high like mountains and filling carriages,
each exhausting their own minds,
to expound the profound intent—
none could follow them so thoroughly as in the Ming era.
The Heavenly Mandate not having yet abandoned this learning,
it is fitting that the world should again flourish in the Dao/Way,
still lamenting the neglect of *original learning* (元学) for long ages,
thus dividing it into three for systematic study,
so that listeners and observers may have a summary.

Daring to hope that the subtle Dao/Way
will be revealed and illuminated,
I shall now expound this scripture,
briefly categorizing it into ten gates (十门) for examination:
1. The origin and cause of the initial teaching,
2. The sequence of teaching separation and unity,
3. The revelation of the doctrine’s essence and its trends,
4. The Heavenly and human transmission of the lineage,
5. The Three Realms (三洞) it encompasses,
6. The scripture’s unique excellences,
7. The initiation of Dao/Way’s cycles and their periods,
8. The distinction between comprehensive and particular teachings,
9. The fulfillment of causes and requests,
10. The division of chapters based on textual analysis.»

**1. The Origin and Cause of the Initial Teaching**
The Classics say: *"The Dao/Way was established by Fu Xi and perfected by Yao, passed through Shun, Yu, Tang, and reached its fullness in the Zhou. After the reigns of King You and King Li, the Zhou dynasty declined, and by the time of Laozi, the world was chaotic without principles or culture. Sagehood did not arise, recluses spoke recklessly, and the people suffered from violence and poison. Laozi lamented the Zhou’s decline, seeing humanity lose its nature and emotions. He sought to restore them to purity and simplicity, returning to the ancient ways. Thus, he composed the *Classic*, emphasizing sincerity and loyalty, valuing simplicity, diminishing ritual propriety, and rejecting wisdom and sageliness, so that later generations might once again see the purity of Heaven and Earth and preserve the essence of antiquity.*

*Laozi was contemporary with Confucius. When Confucius visited the Zhou to inquire about rites, Laozi spoke earnestly, advocating trust and humility. Confucius, however, focused on ren and yi, traveling tirelessly across the world, yet no ruler of his time could employ him. He sighed, ‘The phoenix does not come, the Yellow River does not reveal its map—I am finished.’ The world assumes that since Laozi lived in the declining Zhou, he did not uphold lofty virtue and the Dao/Way, unaware that Confucius, who openly spoke of ren and yi, also failed to transform his age. Indeed, the Dao/Way is the overarching name for ren and yi. If ren and yi cannot prevail, how can the Dao/Way be attained? Thus lies the origin of this teaching.*

**2. The Sequence of Teaching: Separation and Unity**
Many speak of the Dao/Way, yet their views reduce to two main schools. One holds that the Dao/Way is *emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and solitude*; the other, that it is *rites, propriety, laws, and governance*. Those who uphold emptiness and tranquility are deemed lofty and refined, while those who follow rites and laws are seen as moderate.

The lofty and refined withdraw into secluded cliffs, dwelling in desolation, offering no benefit to the world—abandoning themselves to uselessness. Though the world is vast, they discard it like worn-out shoes, refusing even a speck of worldly concern, standing aloof as *perfected beings*.

The moderate, however, are scholars of governance: they refine rites and music, rectify human relationships, standardize measures and weights, and establish laws. The world relies on them for order—they are those who *practice the Dao/Way to benefit the age*. Though they dwell within the realm of civilization, they are called *virtuous persons*.

Once these two paths are fixed, they seem as irreconcilable as ice and fire. Alas, can this truly be the understanding of the Great Dao/Way? It is the fault of unreflective minds.

In truth, the lofty and the moderate both stem from the same Sage’s Dao/Way and heart. The Sage embodies complete virtue, and from this unity arise both inner sageliness and outer kingship—never two separate paths. What was called *emptiness, tranquility, and solitude* is not merely a means of detachment but a cultivation of the three virtues.

*The Classic of Changes* says: *"Meng nourishes the upright—this is the Sage’s achievement."* Hidden yet not revealed, it is called *inner sageliness*; manifest in action, it is called *outer kingship*. Emptiness is the source of all utility; tranquility, the essence of harmony for the world; stillness, the mechanism of motion. When virtue is complete here, one may govern the world.

Thus, when things accumulate, there arise rites; when carved, there arises propriety; when emotions are regulated, there arise laws; when observed, there arise measures. Only then does the path of governance become fully illuminated.

Initially, it does not depart from nature. To exhaust nature is to know Heaven; to clarify nature is to grasp the Dao/Way. The *Book of Yao* calls Yao *"reverent, enlightened, and thoughtful"*—his governance was called *wuwei*. The achievements of *wuwei* all originate from the Dao/Way. How could the Dao/Way and the world be fundamentally divided?

Emotions arise from nature; nature, when fractured, becomes emotion—like water disturbed into waves, which, when still, returns to water. Their essence is one.

If one claims the lofty Dao/Way and the moderate path are utterly opposed, this was not the intent of the Sage in composing the *Classic*. It is the fault of unreflective minds.

Laozi, seeing the Dao/Way decline in the Zhou and humanity lose its nature, expounded the *upper* and *lower* teachings, speaking of the *Great Whole* to rescue the world’s later errors. Later scholars, failing to grasp his intent, divided them into *inner* and *outer* doctrines. The distinction between the moderate and the lofty led some to reject one for the other, or to cling to a single perspective. Since the Three Dynasties, scholars have taken many paths, some favoring one extreme, others a single angle. Without comprehensiveness or balance, how can one deeply understand the Dao/Way?

Only a Sage of perfect wisdom could clarify this.

The Han dynasty prioritized simplicity, yet its governance was limited; the Jin dynasty indulged in empty discourse, corrupting morals until it collapsed. I say that virtue and the Dao/Way are difficult to know and difficult to practice—for this reason.

Some read Laozi’s words and are bewildered, deeming them not the Sage’s teachings. How could they truly know virtue and the Dao/Way?

Yet the *Five Thousand Words* divides its applications into three:
1. The Dao/Way of *wuwei*,
2. The Dao/Way of *long life*,
3. The Dao/Way of *governance*.

Some say the Great Dao/Way is emptiness, yet within emptiness lies the law of governance. Some say governance is the Great Dao/Way, yet governance is merely the residual function of the Dao/Way. As for cultivating the heart and nature, or the methods of *golden elixir* and *returning the elixir*, they cannot be reduced to a single principle.

To forget speech is to exhaust thought—thus one knows the upper and lower teachings harmonize with all methods. Their flexibility is boundless.

**3. The Revelation of the Doctrine’s Essence and Its Trends**
The *Classic* says: *"Speech has its root."* *Zhuangzi* says: *"It does not depart from its root."* This is the *root of Heaven and humanity*.

Sequence exists to follow its principle, hence: *"To speak of the Dao/Way, there must be sequence; to speak of the Dao/Way without its sequence, where then is the Dao/Way?"*

The **Way’s** essence must first be illuminated, then its origins and culmination explored.

Laozi’s *Classic* begins with the **Dao/Way**, then virtue/power.
*Zhuangzi*’s Nine Transformations first clarifies Heaven, then virtue/power follows.
*Zhuangzi*’s words follow the sequence of affairs—thus Heaven comes first.
Laozi’s words follow the sequence of the **Dao/Way**—thus the **Dao/Way** is spoken first.

The **Dao/Way** takes "no-root" as its root, "no-ancestor" as its ancestor.
The Sage’s *Classic* takes *that which is* as its master, for *that which is* is the **Dao/Way**, and the **Dao/Way**’s nature is most mysterious.
With constancy reaching the utmost subtlety, subtlety returning to non-being—
constancy and the **Dao/Way** are nameless,
constancy and name are formless.
Being returns to non-being, being and non-being merge as one.
Having ascended to the Mysterious,
affairs and principles are both forgotten;
having entered this forgetting,
the Triple Mystery begins to manifest.

Good and evil first divide at the Six Pairs,
the wondrous observation swiftly turns toward non-action.
Emerging, it moves freely; retreating, it becomes vast and empty.
The **Dao/Way**’s great foundation is truly non-action.

Color and emptiness preserve the adept’s wondrous observation,
non-action awakens the Sage’s spontaneous stillness.
Words do not destroy illusion—
the **Dao/Way** must have its residue.
What remains unremoved
leads to neither emptiness nor emptiness of emptiness—
yet one must guard against dullness,
calling it purity and clarity.
The mind’s moon must shine brightly—
this is called non-action.
Preserving the nature of Heaven,
it radiates thus, its master being emptiness and nothingness.

*Zhuangzi* says:
*"To take frailty and humility as outward form,
and emptiness without harming all things as substance."*
If the **Dao/Way** is divided into its branches,
and nature and life become distinct—
the branch of nature breaks through conventions to return to truth,
the root of life is deeply rooted and firmly established.

From non-being to being, the Immortal cultivates the alchemical arts;
from being to non-being, nature and principle align with the void.
At its utmost, the **Dao/Way** is non-action.
To clarify its essence and trends,
the **Dao/Way** is taken as the root,
emptiness and nothingness as its fulfillment.

Now its branches and trends are divided into five pairs:
1. Doctrine and teaching—doctrine as root, meaning as fulfillment.
2. Dual illumination and being/non-being—dual illumination as root, the Mysterious as fulfillment.
3. Self-restraint and gentleness—self-restraint as root, self-overcoming as fulfillment.
4. Rectifying causes and cultivating truth—cultivating truth as root, longevity as fulfillment.
5. Divine transformation and sincerity—sincerity as root, returning to antiquity as fulfillment.

**IV. Heaven and Humanity’s Inherited Doctrine**
The **Dao/Way** and virtue/power are one,
Heaven and humanity are unified.
Knowing their unity and acting accordingly—
this is the Great Unity.
Knowing their oneness and acting accordingly—
this is the Great Oneness.
If virtue/power knows the **Dao/Way**,
it ascends to virtue/power and converges.
If the **Dao/Way** knows humanity,
it cultivates through humanity.

Heaven’s **Dao/Way** is remote and difficult to know,
humanity and Heaven are separated.
To bridge them, one must rely on the Sage.
The Sage having passed,
one relies on the *Classic* and diagrams.
Examining the *Classic* to know the **Dao/Way**,
one proceeds from humanity to Heaven.
Obtaining the intent and forgetting the form,
one enters the **Dao/Way** through virtue/power.

The Most High Lord Laozi, the Sage of ultimate **Dao/Way**,
responded to the ages through transformation.
When the Zhou declined,
he illuminated virtue/power to instruct the world.
The *Classic*’s intent—
if one era’s ruler is taken as its master,
then in the Warring States there were sayings like
*"Small states submit to large states,
large states submit to small states."*
When repeatedly speaking of arms as an inauspicious tool,
it was to admonish the rulers of their time with contemporary affairs.
When speaking of the constant **Dao/Way**,
it was to leave behind eternal brilliance,
resonating with all spirits,
enduring without end.

If the **Dao/Way** is restored to its ancient glory,
then purity returns and simplicity is recovered;
cultivating the heart and nature,
then aging is reversed and youth restored;
cleansing all actions,
then subtlety and mystery are perfected.

The Son of Heaven practices it and enjoys Great Peace,
the feudal lords uphold it and stabilize their states,
ministers and great officials uphold it and fulfill loyalty and filial piety,
commoners and scholars uphold it and achieve harmony,
alchemists practice it and ascend to transcendence,
military strategists uphold it and achieve victory.
This is the flow of humanity’s inherited **Dao/Way**.

**V. The Three Caverns’ Scope**
If one adheres to the constant **Dao/Way** and constant name,
to non-action and tranquility,
to non-duality without separation—
invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing,
used without exhaustion—
it precedes the Emperor,
all being the supreme **Dao/Way**,
not to be grasped by form or appearance.

Again, the Six Pairs are unbalanced,
honor and disgrace are like sudden shocks,
the later body and the outer body—
not contending, gentle and frail—
this is the division between great and small.

Again, governing humanity and serving Heaven
is nothing like frugality;
governing a great state is like poaching a small fish—
the Most High knows what exists,
yet acts through non-action, and the people transform themselves.
This is near the division of the common **Dao/Way**.

For cultivating oneself, one’s family, the state, and the world—
"small to great," "compassion," "frugality"—
one does not dare to lead the world,
from love extending to reverence,
using arms with funeral rites,
with subtle clarity in hidden mechanisms—
all these are teachings for self-cultivation.

Again, the spirit of the Valley does not die,
for the belly is full yet the heart is empty.
Nurturing the *po* and embracing Oneness,
the *jing* and *qi* gather while the spirit converges,
vague and distant yet trustworthy—
and that which is easy to know and easy to practice,
yet which no one can know or practice—
this is further than the Nine Elixirs of longevity,
the highest rank in the alchemical school,
yet who can definitively point to its lineage?

Examining this *Classic* deeply,
it speaks of life having both affairs and principles,
encompassing and summarizing all,
mutually containing—
it is called sudden, yet not without gradualness;
it is called gradual, yet gradualness is also spoken of.
This *Classic* blends nature and life,
forming a perfect teaching.
Responding to causes and requests,
Yin Xi becomes its master.
Without recitation, it contracts all divisions of the *Classic*.
Generally, the character *dao* already reaches the utmost subtlety.

As for cultivating truth and nurturing life,
refining *qi* and nurturing spirit—
though they share the gate of transcendence,
they fundamentally differ in the art of halting death.
They constantly merge life’s principles with the **Dao/Way**.
Realizing the utmost **Dao/Way** is non-action,
thus the *Classics* prioritize governing life,
exhausting the transformations of the Five Phases.

**VI. Illuminating the *Classic*’s Superiority**
Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s greatness,
one must follow its entirety.
Speaking of the spirit’s function,
one must focus on its transformations.

If one regards the **Dao/Way** as mere emptiness and stillness,
the soul perishes into annihilation,
and the body becomes like wood and stone,
while beasts and insects share its nature—
how could such a one grasp its transformations?

All the *Classics* arise from the **Dao/Way**, yet the Three Vehicles diverge in their teachings,
and those who fail to comprehend their essence multiply into conflicting sects.

Thus, it demonstrates non-action through silence,
unfolds immortality through its essential keys,
expounds the Five Phases in their hidden workings,
discriminates medicines and minerals by cold and warmth,
illuminates the cycles of rise and decline,
and prohibits heterodox practices through talismans and spells.

The *Classics*, diagrams, edicts, and precepts
each follow distinct paths and doctrines,
though they share the gate of **True Unity**,
they do not yet tread the path of perfect integration.

Comparing their superior qualities,
none rival this *Classic*.
Briefly enumerating its tenfold excellence:
1. It exhausts all laws through constancy;
2. It unifies existence and non-existence through profundity;
3. It demonstrates the most profound as the gate to all marvels;
4. It establishes non-action as the substance of action;
5. It declares the unconquerable as the greatest victory;
6. It speaks of joy while transcending all joy;
7. It conceals numbers within manifest numbers;
8. It regards the Great Treasure as the divine instrument;
9. It advances by retreat in the art of war;
10. It establishes the world through speaking of non-affairs;
11. It restores the age of decline to ancient splendor;
12. It does not liken the great to the unworthy, thus all return to it;
13. It embraces **Oneness** as the **Dao/Way** for governing self and state;
14. It encompasses all *Classics* through brevity;
15. It does not speak of nature, yet all principles of nature are revealed;
16. It encompasses **Dao/Way**, virtue, nature, and life, verifying each in turn.

With this, one may study the principles and tendencies of all *Classics*—
how could they compare to this grand and wondrous application?
The divine craft cannot exhaust its wonders.

**VII. Illuminating the **Dao/Way**’s Manifestation and Its Auspicious Periods**
Heaven’s movements are never constant;
when the time is right, the **Dao/Way** flourishes.

The Great **Dao/Way** is boundless,
yet its manifestation among humanity depends on the times.
From the five *kalpas* of obscurity and clarity,
the Primordial Sovereign guided the transformations,
and since the Three Sovereigns descended,
each dynasty inherited its succession—
sometimes adopting or discarding teachings according to the age,
sometimes rising or declining through events.

Consider:
The Yellow Emperor received the talismans,
Yu of Xia transmitted the symbols,
Emperors Yao and Shun bestowed the *Classics*,
and the Zhou Dynasty displayed its traces.

The Qin King and Emperor Wu of Han sought the elixir of immortality,
Empress Dowager Dou and Emperor Xuan of Han devotedly upheld the teachings of the True Primordial.
The Tang honored the Sacred Ancestor,
and established the principles of the Mysterious Thread.

When the Song Emperor Huizong’s profound wisdom shone,
his enlightened intelligence radiated,
and he received the Emperor’s secret words,
continuing the **Dao/Way**’s lineage left unfinished by the Patriarchs.
He transmitted the Golden Talismans,
opened the Celestial Palace,
composed the *Flying Heaven Law Wheel Dao* Canon,
expounded the edicts of the **Mixed Primordial Emperor**,
broadened the study of the Original Learning,
and established the Three-Shelter system for scholars and commoners.
He honored the Dao Palaces,
granted the Master of Teachings the rank of a high official,
and decreed that celestial talismans, poems, hymns, and diagrams
were treasures unseen in ten thousand ages.

At that time, its grandeur unfolded suddenly,
and none could fathom its origins.
Such extraordinary events
were due to the confluence of declining ages,
though some may have erred in idle discourse,
unaware that the *kalpa*’s transmission had its day,
and the teachings awaited their time.

When the Han Dynasty flourished, the Yellow River School expounded the Mysterious,
and when the Tang Dynasty rose, the Venerable Laozi manifested himself.
When the world nears order, the **Dao/Way** does not act in vain,
but rather enhances the brilliance of the scriptures,
restoring the sequence of Great Peace.

The *Sutra on Guiding Beings* states: *"Four ten-thousand *kalpas* for transmission."*
*Zhuangzi* says: *"A sage appears once in ten thousand ages—
if one seeks profound understanding,
one must first use the fishing basket and the oxcart."*

Those who ride the **Dao/Way** must not forget the Great Teaching.

**VIII. Distinguishing the Universal and the Particular**
All *Classics* have universal and particular aspects:
the universal refers to the general sequence,
the particular to the chapter-by-chapter exposition.

The universal sequence expounds the grand essence of a *Classic*;
the particular sequence unfolds its doctrines chapter by chapter.
For instance, the *Sutra on Guiding Beings* has a preface, middle, and postface,
with hidden meanings not confined to these three chapters.

Now, when categorizing this *Classic* into universal and particular,
the **Dao/Way** and virtue constitute the universal,
while the eighty-one chapters form the particular.

**IX. Responding to Causes and Requests**
When a *Classic* begins without "You asked, and the Venerable Laozi responded, ‘Where are you?’"
it lacks a cause or request.
Examining the *Classics* and transmissions,
the Venerable Laozi taught Yin Xi at the Pass.
It is also said that he first taught Emperor Shun.

Now, in *Direct Pointing*, the Venerable Laozi of the Zhou Dynasty taught Yin Xi,
for the sake of the fundamental principles of nature and life—
a great and profound matter.
Responding to Yin Xi,
who blocked the Pass and invited the Venerable Laozi to impart profound teachings,
this too is a case of responding to a request made clear.

According to the *Sutra of Ascending West*,
Yin Xi, as the Pass Keeper, received the Venerable Laozi as a guest,
and expounded on **Dao/Way** and virtue in two chapters—
the details are well-recorded.

**X. Categorizing by Textual Structure**
A *Classic* is divided into three parts:
the preface, the core doctrine, and the concluding transmission.

This *Classic* lacks opening questions,
so it is deficient in the preface section;
it also lacks concluding words of faith, reception, and practice,
so it is deficient in the concluding transmission section.

Now, we take Ge Xian Gong’s preface as the preface section,
the eighty-one chapters as the core doctrine,
and the propagation of **Dao/Way** and virtue in the world as the concluding transmission.

Furthermore, according to the *Lingbao Scripture*,
the introduction states:
*"All *Classics* take the ultimate fruit as the preface,
the cause as the core,
and enlightenment as the concluding transmission."*

Shao Ruoyu said:
The **Dao/Way** reveals the real through non-action,
granting it special privilege—
this is the clarity of non-being.
Virtue embodies the **Dao/Way** as law and applies it to affairs—
this is the realm of action.
The two characters, **Dao/Way** and virtue,
encompass all things without omission.
The stages and orders they present
depend on the depths of the **Dao/Way** and the divisions of virtue—
if one does not clarify these stages,
there will be mutual confusion and slander.

The Great **Dao/Way** is tranquil and utterly empty,
formless and nameless, beyond speech.
Its scriptures cannot be recorded,
hence it is called the *Great Ease*.
The *Great Ease* refers to the state before *qi* manifests.
When the *Great Ease* moves, the initial *qi* appears,
hence it is called *Taiqi*.
The Venerable Laozi named this strong *qi* as the **Dao/Way**.

「Confucius said: That which is beyond form is called **Dao/Way**.

The Venerable Śākyamuni expounded the Four Noble Truths (*catvāri-āryasatyāni*), also calling it **Dao/Way**.

Thus, it is known that the teachings of these three—
all are fully contained within *being* (*you*).

If one does not proceed from *being*,
how could one attain clarity of non-being?
To clarify non-being through *being*—
this is why the **Dao/Way** has depths and shallows.

The *Great Ease* is the state of utter emptiness (*xūwú*).
When it moves, it becomes the initial stage of *being*,
hence it is called *Taiqi* (*Great Primordial*).
When *qi* manifests, it marks the beginning of form,
hence it is called *Taishǐ* (*Great Commencement*).
When *qi* and form unite,
they produce the essence of firmness and softness,
hence it is called *Taísù* (*Great Substance*).
When *qi*, form, and essence are complete,
yet they have not yet separated—
this is called *Húndùn* (*Chaos*).

Once *Húndùn* divides,
the forces of *yin* and *yang* oscillate,
with *one qi* (*yīqì*) dwelling at the center,
and all things arise from it.
Thus the Venerable Laozi said:
The **Dao/Way** gives birth to *One*,
*One* gives birth to *Two*,
*Two* gives birth to *Three*,
and *Three* gives birth to all things.

Therefore, the Sage observes above and below,
embodies the reverence of Heaven and the humility of Earth,
and applies the **Dao/Way** to govern,
thus manifesting the **Dao/Way** of the enlightened ruler (*míngwángdào*).

Establishing the Five Constants (*wǔcháng*) and the Hundred Virtues (*bǎixíng*),
to rectify the institutions of sovereign and minister,
father and son,
husband and wife,
and to govern and regulate the people.

The **Dao/Way** is without name or trace,
without death or birth,
eternally enduring through countless *kalpas* (*wànjié*) yet unchanging,
supreme and exalted beyond compare,
wondrous and beyond speech.

The **Virtue/Power** of the highest order (*shàngdé*)
embodies *non-action* (*wúwéi*) as its function,
treats *One* as the law to govern the world,
so all things act yet without blame,
give birth yet without possession,
do yet without reliance,
and complete deeds without taking credit.

The lower understanding grasps *being* yet fails to see its treasure—
all things will naturally transform.
Thus, there is no failure or loss,
because *non-action* (*wúwéi*) governs all things.

If one loses this,
then clinging to *One* while indulging in *action*,
it becomes the **Virtue/Power** of the inner self (*nèidé*).

The **Virtue/Power** of the lowest order (*xiàdé*)
embodies *One* as its function,
treats *yin* and *yang* as the law to govern the world—
thus Confucius said, *One* threads through all things (*yīyǐguànzhī*).
The adept in establishing *One* as the norm (*déyīwéizhèng*)
will see all things naturally conform to order (*wànwùjiāngzìbīn*).

If one loses *One* and follows the Five Constants and the Hundred Virtues,
then in affairs, it becomes the **Virtue/Power** of the outer self (*wàidé*).

The **Virtue/Power** of the inner self (*nèidé*)
is to hold fast to *One*.
For *One* is the mother of the realm (*guó*),
the root of life (*shēng*).
To hold fast to *One* without separation
is to have roots deep and foundations firm—
the **Dao/Way** of enduring life and prolonged vision (*jiǔshì*).

Confucius called this **Virtue/Power** supreme (*zhìdé*),
and grounded it in the **Dao/Way**.

Again, the *Middle Way* (*Zhōngyōng*)
is named when *joy, anger, sorrow, and delight* (*xǐnùāilè*) have not yet arisen,
the heart dwelling in the balance of *yin* and *yang*.
The Venerable Śākyamuni called this the *Middle **Dao/Way*** (*zhōngdào*).

The *Mysterious Gate* (*Xuánmén*) loses this and becomes *chatter* (*láo*).
When *yin* and *yang* operate in secret,
they become the basis of *law and technique* (*fǎshù*).

The **Virtue/Power** of the outer self (*wàidé*)
is cultivated through the Five Constants and the Hundred Virtues in one’s person.
Confucius called this **Virtue/Power** responsive (*mǐndé*),
and grounded it in *action* (*xíng*).

To dwell in softness and weakness, uncontentious as water,
yet to overcome hardness and strength through kindness and frugality—
or to appear clumsy and dull-witted—
all these are examples of it.

If one loses this,
then one indulges in cleverness and superficiality,
boasts of strength and prowess,
hunts and revels in fields,
and values wealth while seeking honor and avoiding disgrace.

The **Dao/Way** is very easy to know,
very easy to practice,
yet people love shortcuts (*jìng*),
so its path grows ever more distant,
and its understanding ever more scarce.

The **Great Dao/Way** is plain and simple (*píngyì*),
yet its efficacy lies in *non-action* (*bùwéi*).

In brief, all return to *non-desire* (*wùyù*).
Without desire, one attains tranquility (*jìng*),
and pure tranquility is the rectification for the world.

The Venerable Laozi did not speak of *medicine* (*yào*),
did not speak of *immortality* (*xiān*),
did not speak of ascending to Heaven in broad daylight (*báirìshēngtiān*)—
he only spoke of **Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power**,
not of *technique* (*shù*).

**Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power**—
the *True Scripture of the Great Meaning* (*Zhēnjīng Jíyì Dàzì*)—
here concludes the middle scroll on the grand essence.
Here begins the lower scroll on the grand essence.»

The Venerable Master Far-Dao often expounds upon the profound and mysterious principles of Dao and Virtue/Power.

Those who revere the Old Master (Laozi) as **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*), or who claim his teachings are practical for governance, merely grasp his outward forms and tools—nothing more.

But the Old Master, indeed, traces **Dao/Way** to its origin while encompassing the roots of all tools. Thus, the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures* (*liùjīng*) all fall under his comprehensive influence.

Yet when doubts arise about the Old Master, opinions diverge.

Some say that what the world relies upon for governance—**Benevolence, Righteousness, Ritual, Music, Penal Laws, and Political Order** (*rényì lǐyuè xíngzhèng*)—are like the farmer’s plow or the artisan’s tools: without these implements, there would be no such use. If **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) could be discarded, then governance would be like hoping for order with bare hands—an impossibility in all ages.

Both these views are but self-centered perspectives, unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between **Dao/Way** and tools.

If **Dao/Way** does not depend on tools, then the Old Master’s teachings should be confined solely to **non-action** (*wú*). Yet war and punishment, taxes and wealth, vessels and implements—all these **Dao/Way’s categories and tools** (*dàodào zhī pǐnqì*)—are employed to aid governance. Thus, it is impossible to say that **Dao/Way** ever lacks any of them.

If it cannot lack them, then **Saintly Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness** (*shèngzhì rényì*) must still exist; how could one claim that **Dao/Way** is utterly impractical?

If **Dao/Way** transcends form and tools, then it must not await the Old Master’s words to be illuminated. For since the establishment of the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*) and the division of Heaven and Earth, the creation of scriptures and rituals—ever since the opening of the world—none have spoken of **Dao/Way** before the *Book of Changes* (*Yì*). If **Dao/Way** and tools are both contained within the *Yì*, then why should it depend on the later emergence of the Old Master?

Thus, those who revere the Old Master while claiming he surpasses the *Five Classics*, the *Three History Texts*, and the *Six Scriptures*, or who doubt him while asserting his teachings are empty and useless, all fail to truly understand the Old Master.

Yet the Old Master’s lofty aspirations are indeed present. He delves into the mysteries of **Dao/Way** and speaks of **non-action** (*wú*), exhaustively revealing its subtleties. He employs tools in accordance with **Dao/Way**, yet does not confine himself to mere tools. All that the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects* (*Lún*), and the *Mencius* (*Mèng*) emphasize—recording events without probing their deeper principles—this book fully elucidates.

Therefore, his work may be placed alongside the *Six Scriptures* as equally authoritative.

Some say that sages and worthies discuss **Dao/Way’s origin** to clarify the world. If so, then their words must still harbor unexpressed intentions.

There are two possible explanations. Either their hearers were unworthy of deeper discourse, and thus they spoke only superficially, or their own thoughts were incomplete, and they could only hint at the beginning.

Consider the convergence of human mind and **Dao/Way’s mind** (*dàoxīn*). Though they share common ground, the principle of **single-minded focus** (*jīngyī*) could only be imparted by Yao and received by Shun. Who else could participate?

The **Dao/Way of unity** (*yīguàn*) was only fully expressed by Zengzi’s "One Thread" (*yīwéi*), yet not by Zigong. The **four seasons’ operations** and the **birth of myriad things**—though Zigong heard them, he could not replicate their fullness.

As for **human nature** and the **Dao/Way of Heaven** (*tiāndào*), they are concealed within the written texts. Even Zigong in his early years could not fully grasp them.

All such matters are unexplored depths in the *Six Scriptures*, the *Analects*, and the *Mencius*.

But the Old Master records his transcendent insights, hoping that in ten thousand generations, a **Great Sage** (*dàshèng*) will arise to encounter them. His expectations are distant, so he does not wait for one who can personally receive his words before imparting them.

Thus, the origins of Heaven and Earth, the beginnings of creation and transformation, the foundations of **Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**—all are exhaustively traced and fully expressed. He establishes categories and ranks, arranging them in order, so that the Confucian scholar who seeks profundity and detail has no closer source.

Examining their practical applications, how could they possibly conflict with Confucian principles? They are, in truth, the **greatest aid to Confucian order** (*rúlùn*).

If one could calmly observe, discern his refinements, and grasp his core intent, then the three sages’ teachings would be easily comprehended. Their essence is already unfolded in plain speech, from the *Book of Poetry* (*Shī*) and the *Book of Documents* (*Shū*) onward. Their breadth and depth should only be further summarized here.

**Being and Non-being** (*yǒuwú*)

When speaking of **being and non-being** in terms of form, all that existed before Heaven and Earth could be named as **non-being** (*wú*). Once Heaven and Earth were formed, and without relying on **human beings, things, or affairs** as tools, then all that should be named as **being** (*yǒu*).

This is naming **being and non-being** according to their forms.

Common folk, hearing that the Old Master values **non-being**, doubt that he merely dismisses all forms and physical bodies as irrelevant—thus deeming his teachings impractical.

Yet how could they know that the Old Master’s **being and non-being** (*yǒuwú*) refers to the mutual interplay of **Dao/Way** and tools, which cannot be broadly sought through mere forms?

Moreover, **the Undifferentiated** (*Hùnchéng*) is **the Mysterious** (*Xuán*), and **the Mysterious** is **the Mysterious again** (*yòu xuán*). His inquiry reaches the **invisible and inaudible** (*bùkějiànwén*), and if one seizes it, it is **non-being**—the ultimate.

Yet Heaven, though square and round, arises from this **non-being**—how could this singular **non-being** not encompass all **being**?

When it manifests as **being**, the products of Heaven and Earth are **human beings and things**, and all **human beings and things** contain **original qi** (*yuángas*).

The **Dao/Way’s branches** are **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** (*dé rényì lǐ*), and all **Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, and Ritual** encompass the **Great Dao/Way**.

Thus, all that is called **myriad beings** is but the divided manifestation of the **Undifferentiated**’s **non-being**.

Upon careful reflection, one will then see the **beginning and end** of **being and non-being**.

Therefore, when the *Book of Changes* first speaks of the **Great Dao/Way**, it also considers that the world’s people may not know how **Dao/Way** and tools mutually depend.

Thus, it unites **Dao/Way** and tools as a **single origin** (*yīchū*), and names their manifestations according to what is seen. Hence, what is seen above is called **Dao/Way**, and what is seen below is called **tools**.

The **upper and lower** spoken of here are like saying that within a single entity there exists that which ascends above and that which descends below—yet it cannot be divided into two distinct forms as **ascending** and **descending**.

Fire within the wood, when it ascends and becomes empty, is called **flame**; when it settles and becomes solid, it is called **charcoal**. **Flame** and **charcoal** arise solely from the division of ascending and descending within a single fire. If one claims that the ascending flame is fire, yet the settled charcoal is not fire, then all will recognize the error in this.

This analogy is the most immediate and evident illustration of **Dao/Way** and **tools**’s **upper and lower** distinction.

Laozi, following the *Book of Changes* in speaking of **Dao/Way**, altered its terminology, thus transforming **Dao/Way** and **tools** into **being** and **non-being**, and **upper** and **lower** into **wondrous subtlety**. This was merely to establish his own authority and demonstrate that he had no master to follow.

Yet in essence, there is no difference between them.

When he speaks of **wondrous subtlety**, he combines the notions of **upper** and **lower** and uses the exterior and interior of a single entity to elucidate the distinction between **tools** and **Dao/Way**.

All things that possess form and substance, and all matters that exhibit traces and characteristics—whether as vast as Mount Tai or as minute as an autumn hair, whether as expansive as the heavens or as confined as a broom’s sweep—must have their **upper** and **lower**, their **exterior** and **interior**. Thus, **Dao/Way** and **tools** are never truly separate.

Yet Laozi’s reverence for **non-being** lies in its being the **source** and all-encompassing, not in his delight for its emptiness. His contempt for **being**, too, stems from its **entangling presence** when confined in form.

He does not say that once **being** is engaged, it can no longer be **Dao/Way’s use**.

**Non-being within being**—when form divides **being** and **non-being**, then all that belongs to **Dao/Way** is **non-being**, and all that belongs to **tools** is **being**. Their distinction is easily discerned.

But when **Dao/Way** becomes **tools**, then it has form and substance. With form and substance complete, **true non-being** can no longer be seen.

Now, if we say that Laozi could **master non-being** while **employing being**, then where within its form does he take **non-being**? It is said that **non-being** is inherently carried within **being**. Yet this **non-being** is the most difficult to articulate.

Observe that within all affairs and things, the **empty** and **real** are always in opposition. Thus, those who can comprehend this will understand:

The **real** is its form and substance; the **empty** is that which does not cling to form and substance yet governs the **real** within it.

Therefore, the **emptiness** within the **real** is the **non-being** within **being**. Laozi indeed clarified this principle to teach others.

His key words state:
*"Thirty spokes converge at one hub, yet it is the hub’s emptiness that makes the wheel’s use possible.
Thus, being is for advantage, non-being is for use."*

The reason the wheel can move is that its spokes and hub are complete—so the spokes and hub are the **real** and **being** within the wheel. But when it comes to **rolling over earth** and **moving forward**, this occurs beyond the wheel’s form and substance, where its function does not belong to **being** but instead to **non-being**.

This principle—**being** carrying **non-being**, and **non-being** enabling **use**—is the most verifiable of truths.

Thus, Laozi applied this principle to human affairs and used it to illuminate his teachings. When he says *"being is for advantage"*, he means **cultivating** and **fulfilling** it to ensure its completeness. When he says *"non-being is for use"*, he means **abating** and **reducing** it to achieve its function.

If its completeness is achieved yet there is nothing to **employ** it, then the wheel cannot move on its own. So the spokes and hub are what the wheel **possesses** as **being**, yet the wheel’s **movement** is not what it inherently contains.

What it does not inherently contain should rightly be called **non-being**. This is Laozi’s principle of **transcending being** to **employ non-being**.

Hence, even when **Dao/Way** manifests in **tools**, such as **weapons** or **punishments**, which grow ever more **concrete** and **real**, he does not deem them worthy of explanation.

Therefore, **tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity** are the principles governing **weapons**; **relief and dependence on the people’s livelihood**, waiting for them to **value themselves** and **fear death**, then **punishing** the unworthy to serve as a warning, are the principles governing **punishments**.

**Tranquility and humility, compassion and simplicity**—are these not the very opposites of **swords and axes, slaughter and butchery**? Yet those who **dwell without constraint** and **live without satisfaction** are not the instruments of **swords and axes** that ever sought them.

Laozi takes these two meanings to **transcend** the realm of **weapons** and **punishments**, thereby making his principle of **mastering non-being** while **employing being** clearly evident.

In its ultimate refinement, this principle **goes beyond** speaking of **weapons** as **weapons** or **punishments** as **punishments**, causing **weapons** and **punishments** to **serve his purpose** while he remains **unbound** by them. Only then does he attain the **non-being** he holds in esteem—not the **non-being** that the world misinterprets as **uselessness**.

**Non-being within being**—this principle is not unique to Laozi; Confucius and Mencius also spoke of it.

They said:
*"To hear a lawsuit and still render judgment—this is what I am. My ideal is to make lawsuits nonexistent."*
*"The virtuous have no enemies."*

When two parties **contend in litigation**, only then does a **lawsuit** arise; when two armies **clash in battle**, only then does an **enemy** appear. **Lawsuits** and **enemies** give rise to **weapons** and **punishments**.

Yet if one seeks to **eliminate their source**, it must be through **emptiness** and **non-being**. Thus, the world’s praise—*"a single word can settle a dispute"*—and the **strategic maxims** of *"ensure victory in battle"* or *"exhaust all possibilities"*—these are not what adheres to **Dao/Way**.

Why? Because they **cannot transcend** the **exterior** and are **confined** within the **interior**.

To **roll a brick**, one’s body must be **outside the brick**; yet **pushing or pulling a boat**, the **operations** and **controls** applied are all **not within the boat’s bow or stern**. Thus, **effort is minimal** yet **results are maximal**.

This is also Laozi’s meaning of **leveraging being** in the **spokes and hub**, yet **abating and reducing** it to **non-being** for true **use**.

Although this is merely Confucius and Laozi speaking of **military and penal law** while harmonizing their principles of **being** and **non-being**, their reasoning is already quite clear.

When they speak of **artifacts and things**, they **leverage non-being within being**, and their logic is even more evident.

Confucius spoke of **rites and music**, saying:
*"Rites, rites!"—do they refer to jade and silk?*
*"Music, music!"—do they refer to bells and drums?*
He emphatically declared that **artifacts alone cannot fully embody rites and music**.

The **reverence** inherent in rites is not jade or silk—yet without this reverence, jade and silk cannot fulfill their role as rites.
The **harmony** inherent in music is not bells or drums—yet without this harmony, bells and drums cannot fulfill their role as music.

Thus, both demonstrate the principle of **"substantially relying on emptiness."**

Comparing this to Laozi’s words, bells and drums, jade and silk are like the **spokes and hub of a chariot**—rites and music **depend on artifacts to manifest**. Yet artifacts alone cannot fully constitute rites and music, just as **transcending the spokes and hub** is what enables the chariot’s function in **transportation**. Both follow the same principle.

Moreover, when Laozi expounded the subtleties of **non-action**, applying them to governance, he even claimed that **primitive knotted cords** could suffice.

Thus, it was fitting that he inverted and transformed rites and laws, establishing an alternative approach.

Yet upon closer examination, all the **boats, chariots, weapons, and armor**—these are the very implements of the **Five Emperors and Three Kings**. Yet he dared to claim superiority over the **Six Classics**, saying:
*"My Dao transcends mere forms and artifacts. I will correct superficiality with simplicity, govern the world with non-interference, and await the people’s natural contentment—when they value life and do not flee far. Then, even these material tools, though useful, can be set aside."*

When comparing the principle of **"using non-being"**, it aligns entirely with Confucian thought. It is only their methods of teaching that differ, leading to divergent phrasing.

If Laozi had initially followed the **original language of the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*** and retained its traditional terminology, simply stating:
*"I honor the Dao and humble artifacts. I wield the Dao to command things,"*
then no one would have doubted him.

But because he transformed **Dao and artifacts into being and non-being**, people failed to recognize that **non-being inherently encompasses being**. Thus, his exaltation of **non-being** risked appearing as idle expectation, hoping for results without action—how could they not doubt?

**Great Master Zhang** has already clarified this principle, yet some listeners still disagree. When reading Laozi, if one replaces **"non-being" with "Dao"** and **"Dao" with "non-being"**, the value of non-being becomes clear, and all doubts dissolve.

**Laozi’s use of non-being in three distinct ways** all revolve around **"gathering emptiness to transform reality."**

To **dull sharpness and resolve disputes**, to **harmonize brilliance with the mundane**, to **purify and perceive the profound**, and to **minimize private desires**—these seek to **remove what harms emptiness**.

To **drain excess without depletion**, to **conceal the numinous without revealing it**, to **abandon completion without claiming it**—these seek to **embody this emptiness**.

When it comes to **grasping the reins of emptiness and reality** to regulate the principles of being and non-being, the application of **hardness and softness** is most comprehensive and clearly articulated.

For **hardness as Dao**, if one seeks to **achieve directly without detours**, its form becomes **solid and blocked**.
For **softness as Dao**, it **responds to prompts**, follows without contention—yet within, **real actions and decisions are made**, while **rigidity remains unseen**. Thus, its form is **open and fluid**.

Hence, the **open can govern the blocked**, and **softness often overcomes hardness**.

In all cases—whether **knowing when to be fierce yet yielding**, or **taking the lead by stepping back**—these are all **rejecting hardness’s blockage** and **embodying softness to act through emptiness**.

This is also how one **reverses things** to ultimately achieve **great harmony**.

When the **open and empty** take action, they move **without trace**, accomplish **without effort**—such is their effect.

When **wielding reality while mastering emptiness**, no one can perceive it.
Only when its effects manifest in emptiness do people **suddenly marvel at its mystery**—this is the *Great Dao/Way and Its Manifestations*’ principle of **"not hastening yet arriving swiftly, not moving yet reaching far."**

Thus, he summarizes his overarching principle:
*"Softness is the Dao’s application."*
Then, when explaining how softness is applied, he adds:
*"All things under heaven arise from being; being arises from non-being."*

**Success and failure through non-being**
The principle of valuing non-being has long been a treasure used by ancients and moderns alike. Yet some succeed with it, while others fail.

**King Wen of Zhou** abandoned **Fengxi**, and **Xu Youwang** refused to drive his people into war—these are of one kind.
**Emperor Yuan of Han** was indecisive, and **Emperor Wen** was silent—also of one kind.
Yet their outcomes were vastly different, so later generations, judging by appearances, criticized their failures, saying:
*"Knots and cords could not save the chaos of Qin, nor could the *wu gan* dance resolve the crisis at Pingcheng."*
They thus dismissed Laozi’s words as useless, unaware that the fault lay in their **misapplication**, so how could they be said to understand?

**Liezi** constructed the analogy of the **Xiang and Guo clans** to illustrate wealth, clarifying that **similar intentions led to opposite outcomes**—saying:
*"Xiang understood Guo’s words on wealth but not the Dao of wealth, thus it backfired upon himself."*
His intent was precisely to draw this parallel.

The **Eighty-first Chapter** indeed takes **softness as its foundation**, yet its methods of applying it—**restraining the lenient with strictness, tempering the lax with vigor, acting secretly**—are such that when **misguided people abandon the proper path for the strange**, it is because **rigid integrity and brilliance have already emerged to govern**.

Could it be that there is **only softness and no hardness**?

The people all rely on life while fearing death, yet some still dare to act strangely—if they are seized and killed, then the authority’s power over love is utterly without flaw. Again, if one boasts of their tools’ sharpness and claims victory is certain, then one should merely suppress their strength, weaken their vigor, and cover it with softness. This is not an exclusive adherence to softness.

Thus, all who in this world admire emptiness and simplicity while neglecting practical affairs are those who cling to the receptive yet never grasp the creative. Those who lack the virtue of the ancient sages and seek to engage in mere ritualistic affairs will inevitably meet with ruin.

When the *Dao* is compared to the *Yijing*’s division of existence and nonexistence, it is merely a distinction between *Dao* and its manifestations. Yet in *Laozi*, the gradations of existence and nonexistence are far more intricate. From nonexistence upward, there is the *Xuan* (玄) and then the *Youxuan* (又玄), which becomes the gateway to all marvels. The perpetually nonexistent is merely what one may follow to observe these marvels. But to encompass all marvels and manifest them, one must belong to the *Youxuan*.

From *Xuan* to *Youxuan* is to ascend to the *Dao* as naturalness itself. Naturalness—what is done without doing, what in the world acts spontaneously, transforms itself, rectifies itself, and enriches itself without knowing the power of the Sovereign—this is its effect. Therefore, *Laozi* dares to belittle the wisdom of sages, for he grounds himself in this foundation to elevate his loftiness. Since the *Dao* becomes virtue, and virtue endures by not being possessed, the three names—*One* (一), *Symbol* (象), and *Uncarved Block* (朴)—are its summation.

From this arises heaven and earth, and creation manifests as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness—all are virtue. Yet within the Five Constants, each virtue further divides into higher and lower. When the highest virtue reaches its peak, there is still a deeper virtue beyond it, crowned with *Xuan* as *Xuan Virtue* (玄德). The *receptive female* (牝) and the *receptive unity* (同), the *receptive vision* (览)—these are of the same kind, though their names reside in virtue, their essence has already entered the *Dao*.

Such is the detail, hence those who speak of the Six Classics and *Lunyu-Mengzi* draw from it, truly not in vain. Let us take the discussion of *ren* (仁) between Confucius and Mencius as an example and compare it with *Laozi*’s words, then one will know that though Confucian speech has distinctions, its established gradations do not match the precision of *Laozi*’s insights.

For instance, a child’s love for their parents and rescuing a child from a well are both called *ren*. Yet the *Nine Alliances and One Rectification* is said to be the opposite of truly attaining the name of *ren*. This distinction, though acknowledged by Confucius and Mencius, was never fully elaborated in their gradations. As for broadly benefiting and aiding the people, extending it to the sage, even Zigong doubted whether it fully exhausted *ren*’s principles—because the gradations were insufficiently refined, and the standard could not be firmly established.

Thus, the Six Classics and Confucius-Mencius must rely on *Laozi*, for all such cases are of this nature. This is not to oppose *Laozi* while suppressing Confucianism; *Laozi*’s focus on nonexistence allows him to elaborate further on the *Dao*’s gradations. If one reverses the perspective, then Confucian speech, detailed in worldly affairs, appears overly sparse and vague in *Laozi*’s eyes. Since their fundamental orientations differ, their discussions naturally vary in depth—this is inevitable, not a matter of superiority or inferiority.

As for *Laozi*’s nonexistence, its need for the Six Classics’ existence is something everyone recognizes, requiring no further debate.

**On the Sequence of the *Dao*:**
To ascend from learning to enlightenment, one must first follow the path and only then enter the chamber. There is a beginning and an end, firmly establishing its ordered sequence. The world holds *Laozi* in too high regard, saying that he does not discuss the *Dao*’s manifestations. Thus, whenever his teachings touch on practical cultivation, they always lead to self-reduction and nonexistence. Hence, his writings, though seemingly superficial, are in fact the outer and inner layers of nonexistence—yet they cannot encompass the nonexistence that contains existence.

Both Confucian and Daoist discussions of the *Dao* treat its manifestation as the key to sagehood. Yet when examining how transformation is achieved, they all rely on reducing existence to enable the transformation of existence into nonexistence. From this principle, one can discern the *Dao*.

Reduction begins with cultivation—like fermenting millet and adding mold to make wine. Once completed, the millet and mold transform into sweetness. This is indeed the symbol of transforming existence into nonexistence. Yet has there ever been, from ancient times to now, one who could alter water alone without millet and mold?

If one seeks refined wine from mere water without first fermenting millet and adding mold, it is like demanding the five flavors from an empty vessel—this is to leap from the stage of cultivation to the beginning of reduction, claiming to achieve transformation without the necessary preparation. If cultivation is not yet complete, what foundation will receive this reduction?

Such cases vary with depth and shallowness. The world will surely criticize them as superficial. Yet those who dare to trust themselves will harmonize the Six Classics with Confucius and *Laozi*, finding no discrepancy. Even if *Laozi* were to rise again, this statement would remain unchanged.

**On Heaven and Humanity:**
From ancient times...

「Existence and nonexistence are but two brushstrokes. The Great Dao in which one abides is boundless and obscure, profound and silent—this is the state of nonexistence. From nonexistence to existence, from existence to transformation, returning again to nonexistence, then its existence and nonexistence are as one. The Dao of cultivation and reduction is likewise: beginning with existence and ending with nonexistence, then existence and nonexistence are again as one.

The earlier discourse on existence and nonexistence relies upon the interplay of yin and yang in life and death. Once things are formed, they revert to their root—this is the Dao of Heaven’s existence and nonexistence. When virtue is manifested through benevolence, righteousness, and propriety, and its deepest essence aligns with the Dao, then this is the Dao of Humanity’s existence and nonexistence. Though both arise from the same origin, their expressions differ vastly, so they cannot be conflated. Hence, *Laozi*’s words sometimes fail to distinguish between Heaven and Humanity, conflating their existence and nonexistence, for he knew their root was one and did not need to separate them as distinct.

**On *Laozi*’s Rejection of Sage-Wisdom, Benevolence, and Righteousness:**
Those who deeply understand *Laozi*’s outright abandonment of sage-wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness say: This is but a rhetorical exaggeration, not his true intent. Yet the world, past and present, mostly blames him for his words clashing with the Classics. Yet if one listens to his teachings and examines his deeds, the true principles become evident, and he cannot be falsely accused.

The *Yijing*’s thirteen hexagrams that emphasize symbols and instruments—including the saying, *"垂衣裳而天下治"* (governing by hanging one’s robes and the world is in order)—draw upon the principles of *乾* (Heaven) and *坤* (Earth). This was the very method by which the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun successively innovated and upheld governance. Thus, sage-wisdom was indeed the domain of the Yellow Emperor as well.

*Laozi* invoked the Yellow Emperor to found his teaching, yet condemned all ancient sage-wisdom as false, implying even the Yellow Emperor was among those rejected. How could one person, whose Way could be emulated yet whose methods were utterly discarded? Judging by *Laozi*’s own deeds, his words were but ornamentation, not substance—this is clear.

**On Zhuangzi’s Expansion of *Laozi*’s Teachings:**
Zhuangzi further magnified and broadened his master’s doctrine, declaring that *"剖斗折衡而民不争"* (splitting the measuring cup and breaking the scales would make the people cease contention). This statement especially compounds the criticism leveled against *Laozi*’s teachings. Yet within it lies truth, and one can use his own words to illuminate their rhetorical nature.

Both *Laozi* and Zhuangzi championed the practice of knotting cords (*结绳*) as a method they claimed had been effective in antiquity. Yet knotting cords—what is its origin? Was it not a means for people to trust one another in a time when written records did not yet exist? If their purity and simplicity were intact and no deceit remained, why would they need knotted cords at all? Extending this logic, it seems they were merely aspiring to create written contracts (*书契*) but had not yet reached that stage.

In the age of unadulterated antiquity, when laws were not yet needed, they still relied upon knotted cords for trust. Yet to say that human deceit had reached its extreme and that laws could not restrain it, while hoping to eliminate all such tools and thus extinguish contention—this is impossible unless *Laozi* himself ruled as sovereign and his disciple, Yin Geng, was appointed alongside Zhuangzi to govern the people. Otherwise, contention would persist.

Thus, Zhuangzi lamented his own rhetorical excesses, and at the end of his work, he clarified: *"周之辞荒唐而说谬悠"* (The language of Zhou is extravagant and its explanations fanciful). His claim to not betray the Dao rests upon his ability to return to the fundamental principles and harmonize them with the highest truths, reaching only then what may be called sincere discourse.

Those who point to *Laozi*’s teachings as mere nihilism follow only his initial extravagant and fanciful words, unaware of the deeper truths revealed after his harmonization with the highest principles. Confucius and Mencius, whose lives overlapped with *Laozi* and Zhuangzi’s, spoke without restraint. If Confucius or Mencius had encountered such doctrines, they would have systematically refuted them, yet they never did. This is because their differences did not harm their underlying unity.

The scattered principles of the *Yijing* found in its sixty-four hexagrams were later consolidated in the *Xīcí* (Appendices). Examining *Laozi*’s entire work, his reasoning never strays beyond what is found in the *Xīcí*, nor does he establish any separate doctrine. Judging by his intent, it appears he drew his roots from the *Yijing* and gathered its branches from the upper and lower *Xīcí* (Appendices).

Confucius and Zhuangzi both revered their teachers, yet it is said that *"孔氏尝即老氏而北面焉"* (Confucius once stood facing *Laozi* in respect). This claim seems to be an attempt to deflect criticism by exaggerating his own veneration, masking the truth with grandiosity. Later, in the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu took offense at these words and addressed them in his *"原道"* (Discourse on the Way), blaming the Confucian scholars for failing to refute them. This was indeed a defense of orthodoxy.

Yet my view differs. If there is alignment with the Dao, the Dao cannot be divided—how could one not inherit it? If there is no objection to inheriting, then why should one reject the other? Thus, whether Confucius took *Laozi* as teacher or not is irrelevant.

Confucius once said:
*"晋之乘，楚之梼杌，鲁之春秋，其义一也。其事则齐威、晋文，其文则史，其义则丘窃取之矣。"*
(The chariot records of Jin, the bamboo annals of Chu, and the Spring and Autumn Annals of Lu all share the same principles. Their events concern figures like Qi Wei and Jin Wen, their texts are historical records, and their meaning is what I have appropriated.)

Again he said:
*"三人行，必有我师焉，择其善者而从之。"*
(When three people walk together, there is always one who may be my teacher. I select their good qualities and follow them.)

If Confucius had truly taken *Laozi* as his teacher, then even upon hearing their words directly, he would have no bias. If *Laozi* were to adopt Confucius’ methods and use them to uphold his own Way, why would his followers’ excessive partiality and overzealous veneration harm their belonging to my school?」

Thus, whether one takes Laozi as a teacher or not, his words may be entrusted to ambiguity, yet there are some that cannot but be discerned. Confucius is revered by all ages as the origin of virtue and power, because he gathered the wisdom of the sages and achieved greatness, yet even when his heart wandered, he never transgressed the bounds.

Now, if Laozi were to fabricate words to portray Confucius, and claim that he was arrogant and boastful, while his teachings were not fully exhausted, this would imply that at times Confucius might indeed have surpassed the bounds, yet how could he be worthy of instructing the limitless future generations? This is a harm to Confucius’ deeds and a hindrance to his essence.

For this reason, the Great Chang thoroughly examined Laozi’s words and exhausted their long-standing interpretations. After careful study, he realized that the two books generally spoke of the Dao and its sequence, often borrowing the language of Confucius and Yan Hui to illustrate shallow analogies. Thus, the reverence of the three sages for Confucius is already profound.

Yet their exaggerated claims are not entirely accurate. When Mozi spoke of Yan Hui’s "seated-forgetting" (坐忘), comparing it to Confucius, he placed it within the realm of "ear-obedience" (耳顺), but in Laozi’s teaching, it becomes a means of self-benefit and self-diminishment.

Zhuangzi, in his portrayal of Confucius and Yan Hui conversing, said: "Yan Hui, I exchanged one arm with you and lost it." This implies that Yan Hui could diminish himself but not fully attain the state of non-action (無). Again, he once described Yan Hui’s self-expression as: "The Master does not speak, yet the people follow; he lacks implements, yet the people pour forth before him." Yan Hui was beyond reach.

The Master (Confucius) dashed away, leaving dust behind, yet Yan Hui could not catch up. Therefore, to diminish further and attain the state of "non-action yet nothing is left undone" (無為無不為), only Confucius could truly meet this standard. Here, their hierarchy is clearly distinguishable.

How could there be a sage whose virtue is outwardly manifested, who already possesses the power of "not speaking yet being trusted" and "neither benefiting nor diminishing" yet is accused of boastful arrogance? Thus, the books’ treatment of Confucius—sometimes suppressing and sometimes elevating him—generally employs two contrasting approaches to provoke reflection in those who hear only one perspective.

Hence, the two sages (Laozi and Zhuangzi) mutually attack Confucius, yet their words do not contradict the Dao, all falling into this category.

The *Daodejing* divides its text into two volumes, calling them collectively the *Daodejing*—this tradition comes from Wang Bi. The Great Chang believes that this collective title originated from antiquity. Now, the current editions that separately label them as the *Daojing* and the *Dejing* likely reflect later annotations, for even the upper volume speaks of governance and warfare, while the lower volume discusses the unity of Way and virtue, the interplay of hard and soft, and thus fully reveals that virtue and power cannot be divided.

The numbering of chapters—eighty-one in total—each marked by the first phrase of the chapter to indicate their order, may also be a later addition. Yet the idea that the five thousand words were originally eighty-one teachings must surely come from Laozi himself.

In each chapter, there are phrases beginning with "故" (*gu*—"thus"), "故" (*gu*—"thus"), and "是以" (*shìyǐ*—"therefore"), all seeking to connect the upper and lower threads, making the words concise yet the meaning complete.

Each chapter’s language has its own starting point, yet the meaning within a single chapter is also interconnected, clarifying the principles. But those who interpret its meaning take each sentence as a separate doctrine, making this sentence incompatible with others, and each chapter as a distinct teaching, making this chapter irrelevant to others—this is not in line with Laozi’s intent.

As for the naming of chapters, from Wang Bi onward, all subsequent editions align with the current transmitted text, except for He Shang Gong, who emerged in the early Han dynasty, and whose chapter names differ. If Laozi himself had personally set and named them, there would certainly be no such divergence.

This pattern is evident.

The teachings of Laozi are indeed profound and difficult to grasp in their utter emptiness. Yet, the Master He Shang [河上公] thoroughly examined the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] from beginning to end, revealing patterns and precedents that mutually illuminate each other. When the language of one chapter merely introduces its meaning without concluding it, the subsequent chapter must offer another discourse to bring it to completion. Thus, He Shang’s annotations all clarify their convergence, gathering scattered meanings and preserving them in unity, so that one may see how Laozi, though advocating the "Way of No-thing" [谈无], yet in its divisions resembles the *Zhou Guan* [《周官》]'s Six Ordinances [六典]—with general and particular distinctions, large and small details, sequentially permeating each other, and every passage capable of thorough examination. How could this be likened to the hollow, non-existent assumptions of the Zongzi [岂同子虚]?

Those who claim Laozi’s words are mere empty vessels, let them ponder this: the **separation and concealment** [离隐].

Laozi, with his elevated worldly insight, could fathom the depths of the Dao [道奥], having indeed exhausted all that exists in his discourse, yet also allowing his meaning to extend beyond mere words. Thus, there emerged the form of **separation and concealment** [离隐].

What is meant by **separation** [离]? It is that a single truth is dispersed across multiple chapters, yet no single chapter fully exhausts it.

What is meant by **concealment** [隐]? It is that he speaks of what is so without explaining *why* it is so, hoping that those with profound understanding will grasp it themselves. Hence, his words are like the **Lian Mountains and Duanyu Gorges** [连山断壑], disjointed yet interconnected.

Interpreters who fail to grasp this fall into the error of fragmenting chapters and sentences, leaving the Dao’s principles scattered and incomplete.

Confucius said: *"Lift one corner and the other three corners will not respond, then I will not teach you again."* This is precisely the **separation and concealment** [离隐] he spoke of.

Thus, He Shang, in his effort to clarify the corners, dared not to be lax, only seeking to avoid mere dissection.

Those who annotate Laozi’s text in later ages often focus on extracting profound and abstruse phrases, deepening obscurity to the point of making his words seem **lean and cryptic** [廋辞隐语]. Again, like later Buddhist masters discussing *Chan* [禅], leaving readers utterly perplexed.

He Shang could not fully determine their correctness, but he heard an ancient saying that used painting to criticize worldly habits: *"Painters delight in depicting ghosts and gods, yet hesitate to paint dogs and horses."* Since the skill of painting dogs and horses can be measured, yet ghosts and gods are dim and indistinct—this is why He Shang, whenever he encountered such annotations, would clarify their language and verify them with human affairs, illustrating their success or failure. His explanations were indeed appropriate.

But if one seeks to borrow obscurity for profundity, hiding within what cannot be interrogated, why not simply refrain from speaking at all?

**He Shang’s annotations and Zhuangzi’s text** [列庄]:
In antiquity, there were no annotations or commentaries. If one wished to expound upon earlier works, they would compose a separate book to elucidate them. Hence, the *Liezi* [列氏] and *Zhuangzi* [庄氏]—these two books—stand as the very **explanations of meaning** [义疏] for the *Five Thousand Words* [五千言].

Laozi’s language is concise and austere, not expansive, and his **separation and concealment** [离隐] renders it difficult to immediately comprehend. These two masters, however, elaborated and compiled his teachings.

Yet, there are those whose elaborations go too far, veering into **fanciful and unfounded claims** [诞].

Still, their gathering of scattered truths and rendering of clear distinctions—whether concerning the Dao or its manifestations—all find proper resolution.

By comparing these two masters’ interpretations with those of others, one sees that those who delight in depicting ghosts and gods yet fail to truly recognize them are many.

**General preface and postscript** [大旨序跋]:

The *Yijing* [《易》] speaks of *"Heaven’s Mysterious"* [天玄], and again says *"the divine"* [神]—that which subtly encompasses all things and gives rise to speech.

The Mysterious [玄] is Heaven’s true essence, the divine [神] refers to the unfathomable interplay of *yin* and *yang* [阴阳]. Laozi equates subtlety with the Mysterious; the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious is not the source from which all subtleties emerge?

Su Shi [苏子瞻] composed *The Record of the Hall of All Subtleties* [《众妙堂记》], beginning when he observed a man scattering water and trimming grass, whose hands moved like wind and rain, and whose steps followed perfect measure—then sighed at his skill, and later, using the molting of cicadas and the brooding of hens, described the true subtlety of the Dao [道之真妙].

Such techniques, though refined, are acquired through practice, not innate genius.

Confucius, when the Duke of Zhou [周] visited Lu during the reign of Duke Zhao [鲁昭公], asked: *"Have you attained the Dao?"* If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would present it to their rulers; if it could be transmitted to others, then all would pass it to their descendants. Yet this is impossible, for without an inner master, the Dao cannot be obtained.

He Shang was invited to serve as the *Cang Shi* [藏室史] in Zhou’s archives, and his son, named Zong [宗], held a military position in Wei. Several generations later, his descendant named Yun [云], still bearing the name Jie [解], became the tutor for the Prince of Jiaoxi [胶西王] during the Han dynasty.

Laozi was not without office nor descendants; yet his profound and subtle teachings were neither presented to his ruler nor transmitted to his progeny. Was this not because the Zhou dynasty was in decline, the great Dao about to vanish, and the only one to record it and leave it to the world was the Prefect of Guan [关令]? Those without inner mastery could never truly hear it.

The Han Emperor Wen [汉文帝] reigned for twenty-three years, personally cultivating profound silence and relying solely on *virtue* [德] to transform the people—this may be said to encompass all subtleties and attain them.

He Shang displayed his divine transformations: leaping into the air and soaring through emptiness, only to rest in the Mysterious. If this is what he considered the Mysterious, how could it be Laozi’s Mysterious?

Neither the *Records of the Grand Historian* [《史记》] nor the *History of the Han* [《汉书》] record him, and there is good reason for this.

Master Liu Yuewu [刘月屋], the overseer of the *Xuanmiao Guan* [玄妙观] in Changde [常德路], compiled annotations on the *Dao De Jing*, which Qian Zhi [钱梓] regarded as a beacon for the distant transmission of the teachings. This was indeed a scholar with aspirations toward contemplating the Mysterious.

Thus, I recount what I have heard to inform you, so that you may verify it with the renowned sages of the world.

In the winter of the third year of Yuan Zheng [元贞丙申孟冬], on the day after the full moon, I observed the rituals of the recluse Mr. Ba [居士巴] in the Chuan Yang [辰阳] region, seeking to clarify the Dao’s subtleties and concealments.

In ancient times, our Laozi transmitted the *Dao De Jing* [《道德经》] to the world, its profound principles deep and obscure, not merely for the sake of teaching and guiding others. Across generations, enlightened rulers and great scholars have all annotated and studied its subtleties, passing it down endlessly from ancient to modern times. Even Daoists today recite its core text, yet still fear they do not fully grasp its intent. Without consulting the annotations of various masters, how could one truly penetrate the depths of its mysteries?

The sage **Yongyi** once delved into its hidden depths yet never fully grasped its essence, always devoting himself wholeheartedly to gathering annotations from a hundred schools, probing their profound meanings, and intending to compile a *Ji Yi* [《集义》] to share with like-minded seekers. Now, through the generosity of **Ding Bianxiu** of Shitan, whose family treasures contained the annotations of eminent scholars, combined with the books held by **Yongyi** himself, he has compiled all eighty-one chapters into thirty-one volumes.

The cost of printing and binding was immense, beyond what one alone could bear, so he joined his disciples **Zhao Yizhuang** and **Liu Yijian** in traveling widely, soliciting contributions from officials, scholars, and Daoist priests alike, thus fulfilling this noble endeavor. Over a span of more than ten years, he never forgot it, even in moments of rest or repose. Now, through his tireless effort, the work is complete. Upon revisiting and savoring its depths, he affirms it as truly refined, profound beyond measure.

If emperors and nobles adhere to it, their realm will flourish, and the world will know peace;
If ministers and officials uphold it, they will be loyal to their sovereign and filial to their kin;
If scholars and commoners embrace it, they will return to simplicity and sincerity;
If Daoists embody it, they shall transcend the mundane and attain sainthood—
This is the Dao, this is virtue/power,
Before Heaven and Earth, its beginning is unseen;
After Heaven and Earth, its end is unseen.

Is this not the meaning of this *Jing*?

To all my fellow seekers who uphold and cherish it, I pray you do not neglect it.

The Great Virtue of the third year, in the cycle of *ji-hai*, on the late evening of the Upper Element Festival, the humble Sima Weiyong penned this postscript in coarse robes.

The *Laozi* is nothing but an attempt to emulate Heaven. Indeed, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows Nature. When it says, *"All things arise without claiming merit, give birth without possession, act without reliance, and complete their work without taking credit,"* these four phrases—though differing in degree—are the very voice of the Sage.

For Heaven does not claim merit in creating all things, yet it gives birth without possession—its generative intent fills Heaven and Earth, yet it never claims the deed as its own. It acts without reliance—its work pervades Heaven and Earth, yet it never boasts of its power. Its deeds are never undone, yet it does not dwell upon completion—this is the Way of Heaven.

When it says *"not striving,"* *"not seeing what is desirable,"* it is to keep the heart undisturbed. When it says *"stillness and tranquility are the rectification of the world,"* it is nothing but emulating Heaven. Thus, when I do nothing, the people transform themselves; when I love stillness, the people rectify themselves; when I have no affairs, the people grow wealthy; when I have no desires, the people return to simplicity. These are the verifiable effects of *wuwei*.

To expound the *Laozi*, one must not depart from emulating Heaven, from Nature, from stillness and *wuwei*—otherwise, there is no ground for words. Thus, in my humble attempt to elucidate the *Laozi* through these principles alone, perhaps I have glimpsed its intent.

One day, the revered Xuanmiao Sima Yuewu showed me his *Laozi* commentary, written at Shitan, and asked me to add annotations. I said: *"My ancestor, the Preceptor of Ying, has already devoted great effort to this text. The Master of Po has praised it, saying that if such a work had existed in the Warring States, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei; if it had existed in the early Han, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been divided."* Even Cheng Taihe admired its excellence. How could I dare to surpass my ancestor’s insights with my own?

Yuewu said: *"The principles of the text are boundless—how could one exhaust its depths without ceaseless exploration, like water flowing endlessly?"* Unable to refuse, I reluctantly undertook the task. After many days, the work was complete—sufficient in scope, though I could never hope to follow in my ancestor’s footsteps. I humbly present this, hoping that readers will understand my intent and not fault my presumption.

Written on the eve of the Double Ninth Festival by the former scholar-official, Respectful Quietness, Su Qizong.

The *Dao De Jing* of five thousand words, with over a hundred commentaries, who truly knows the heart of the Supreme Venerable?

In the year *Zhi Yuan* of the *Renwu* cycle, the Dao was obstructed by the times, the text reduced to ashes by fire—only the five thousand words remained intact. Was it not fate that preserved the *Lü Lingguang* alone? Those clad in yellow headgear chanting morning and evening, yet some still stumble over sentence structure—I privately sighed deeply, not shirking presumption, and corrected its errors while elucidating its meaning.

At the time, I exchanged letters monthly with the Stone Pool Master, who requested this work, so I recorded it and sent it to him. Upon his first reading, he praised it. In the year *Xinmao*, I was honored to present the *Yi* and *Lao* texts as a tribute, earning the title of "Ancient Scholar."

In the summer of *Bingshen*, Master Chang Wu of the *Zhao* clan, Zhao Guandao, came to rectify the essential principles of learning, showing me the Stone Pool Master’s two works. He instructed me to place my newly published *Dao De Jing* commentary—written in vernacular style—among the other interpretations, and entrusted me with further revisions. I was astonished, then fell ill with shock. Having already set the text to print, I could not retract my labor.

In the summer of *Jihai*, I braved the heat to visit the Stone Pool Master, but his printing was only two-thirds complete, and the Stone Pool Master himself had already become an ancient. Amid my sorrow, I reflected on the sayings of "wooden drill piercing stone, grinding bricks into mirrors," and composed this in ancient style, urging perseverance to resolve this grand case.

What mortals desire, Heaven grants—this text’s survival is Heaven’s will. That all interpretations converge into one to ensure immortality is also Heaven’s will. Can mortals defy Heaven? The foolish thus begin and end by attributing all to Heaven.

Before departing, the Stone Pool Master requested an epilogue, so I appended these words to the end. This autumn, the seventh month, the former scholar-official, Respectful Clarity, Yue Qingzhong, wrote this.

The *Dao De Jing* encompasses Heaven and Earth in its vastness, yet delves into the minutest details—its language is concise, yet its meaning profound. How could a mere jade box or golden key unlock its depths so hastily?

From ancient to modern, commentaries and poetic interpretations abound, each with its merits, yet often omitting what others grasp—like eight musical tones discordant, failing to achieve harmony. The Stone Pool Master, Liu Weiyong, compiled the five thousand words into thirty-one volumes, gathering seventy-eight commentaries—whether from Daoists, Confucians, Buddhists, recluses, or the obscure—even the most ethereal phrases of the *Luanbi* style were not discarded. In a single glance, one enters a treasure house: gold, pearls, coral, ivory, rhinoceros horn, mercury, cinnabar, green herbs—jade slips scattered in myriad forms. Was this not the culmination of all interpretations?

Alas, this text was not composed by Master Guanyin in a single revelation—his contribution was immense, yet Master Liu’s achievement is no lesser. Though the Supreme Venerable upholds *wuwei* as his principle, those who recite this text, through seventy-eight schools and countless words, arrive at the five thousand words, then at one word, then at no-word—like the Dragon and the Old Man of the South, they ascend effortlessly to the void, exclaiming, *"The child is teachable."*

Great Virtue, *Gengzi* month, the eighth day after the full moon, the Heavenly Master’s successor, the Great Substance, Broad Dao, True Person Zhang Yucai, wrote this epilogue.

*The Dao De Jing*’s grand essence and comprehensive meaning conclude here.
