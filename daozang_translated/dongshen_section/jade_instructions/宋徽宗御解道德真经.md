**Fascicle One of the Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue by Emperor Huizong of Song**
**Classic of the Dao, Part One**

The Dao is that by which all people universally abide.
Virtue is that which the heart naturally attains.

The Dao, once established, endures for ten thousand generations without decay.
Virtue fills the constancy of one’s nature, ever abiding.

In the late Zhou, when Laozi lived, the Dao declined and virtue waned. Thus, he composed a work of eighty-one chapters to elucidate the constancy of the Dao and virtue, calling it a *Classic*.

Its words are concise, its meaning profound—scholars must silently comprehend and deeply cultivate it.

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken"**

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

The beginningless is called the Dao—yet the Dao cannot be spoken, for speech misrepresents it.
It is also said that the Dao should not be named. That which can be spoken or named is like things and affairs, like the four seasons: responding when fitting, rising and falling in turn—none of this is truly constant.

The eternal Dao and eternal name arise from their own root, their own origin. Before heaven and earth existed, they have abided since ancient times.
Fuxi attained it and inherited the Mother of Qi.
The Queen Mother of the West attained it and dwelled in Shaoguang.
None know its beginning, none know its end.

The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.

The Dao is eternally nameless; even heaven and earth await it to come into being—this is what Zhuangzi meant by "giving birth to heaven and earth."
Before heaven and earth existed, who could name it?
Thus, the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
Only after heaven and earth exist do the ten thousand things arise—thus, the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.

Therefore, through eternal non-being, one observes its mystery.
Through eternal being, one observes its manifestations.

Zhuangzi said: "Establish it in eternal non-being and being."
Not establishing a single thing—this is called eternal non-being.
Not discarding a single thing—this is called eternal being.
Eternal non-being pertains to principle; above, it is not dazzling—it is the utmost refinement under heaven, thus one observes its mystery.
Eternal being pertains to affairs; below, it is not obscure—it is the utmost transformation under heaven, thus one observes its manifestations.
These two realms, being and non-being, contain both manifestations and mystery.
With great wisdom, one observes both—nothing is impossible.

Within the indistinct and vague, there are images and things.
Small wisdom is self-serving, blinded by partiality: abandoning being to cling to emptiness, pursuing ends while forgetting roots—thus the arts of the Dao are rent asunder under heaven.

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names—together they are called the profound.
The Dao is originally without form—how can one exhaust its mystery?
Self and other share the same root; right and wrong are of one qi—thus they are together called the profound.
The deluded of the world grasp at the false to seek the real, drifting ever farther from truth, not realizing that being and non-being are merely different names.

Profound and yet more profound—the gateway to all mysteries.
The *Plain Questions* says: "The profound gives birth to spirit."
The *Book of Changes* says: "Spirit is that which is spoken of as the mystery of the ten thousand things."
The subtle, when diminished, is called the profound—the profound is the color of heaven.
That which is colored by color is manifest, yet that which colors color has never been revealed.
"Profound and yet more profound"—this refers to that which colors color.
The principle of profound mystery is possessed by the ten thousand things.
What moves heaven, what stabilizes earth, what makes humans numinous, what flourishes the hundred things—all are mysterious, yet all emerge from the origin. Thus, it is called the gateway to all mysteries.
When Confucius composed the *Book of Changes*, he only spoke of mystery in the *Shuogua*—yet Laozi placed it at the head of his work. The words of the sages form a beginning and end for one another.

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.
When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.

The Dao has no distinct form—how can there be beauty or ugliness?
Nature is originally unified—how can there be good or not-good?
Where there is beauty, ugliness stands in opposition—thus it is said: "When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises."
Where there is goodness, not-goodness stands in opposition—thus it is said: "When all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises."
What the world deems beautiful is called the wondrous; what it deems ugly is called the foul.
Yet the wondrous may transform into the foul, and the foul may transform into the wondrous—how then can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?
What was once deemed right may now be deemed wrong; what is now discarded may later be employed—how then can good and not-good be chosen?

The sage embodies true non-being yet is ever present,
manifests wondrous function yet is ever non-being.
Beauty and ugliness, good and not-good—these will be simplified yet not obtained. How then can ugliness and not-goodness become burdens?

Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another;
difficulty and ease complete one another;
long and short shape one another;
high and low incline toward one another;
sound and echo harmonize with one another;
before and after follow one another.

Before the Great Simplicity divided, the ten thousand images shared a single body.
After the Two Modes arose, each thing formed a pair.
These six pairs are the intersections of all transformations, the origins of a hundred deliberations, the starting points of divergent paths—how the people of the world sink into them yet may free themselves!

Non-being moves and gives rise to being; being returns to non-being—thus it is said: "Being and non-being give rise to one another."
When one encounters perilous difficulty, one knows the ease of traversing land—thus it is said: "Difficulty and ease complete one another."
Long and short shape one another, as with a foot and an inch.
High and low incline toward one another, as with mountains and marshes.
Sound is raised and echo responds—thus it is said: "Sound and echo harmonize with one another."
Form moves and shadow follows—thus it is said: "Before and after follow one another."

The movement of yin and yang, the progression of the four seasons, the principles of the ten thousand things—suddenly they arise, fleetingly they vanish.
Their difficulty lies in governing the world through action.
Their ease lies in adapting the self through non-action.
Nature’s length cannot be severed; nature’s shortness cannot be extended.
Heaven is naturally high; earth is naturally low.
Strike the gong and the gong resounds; strike the horn and the horn responds.
Spring leads and summer follows; the elder leads and the younger follows.
Though these paired conditions are all lodged within the Dao, they are far removed from it.

Thus the sage abides in non-action, practicing the teaching without words.
To abide in non-action—this is what *Zhuangzi* calls "employing the world through non-action."
To practice the teaching without words—this is what the *Book of Changes* calls "establishing teaching through the spirit-way, and the world submits."

To act is to invite completion and loss; to speak is to risk right and wrong. How could this not entail entanglement? How could this be how the sage stands alone above the ten thousand things, transforming them while remaining untouched by their burdens?
The ten thousand things arise without refusal, live without possession, act without reliance, and accomplish without abiding.
Only by not abiding does one not depart.

The ten thousand things all arise, responding to stimuli as a mirror reflects form—beauty and ugliness fully revealed.
As an echo answers sound—good and evil alike come forth, without refusal.
Thus it is said: "They arise without refusal."
Each takes shape and transforms itself, each lives and colors itself, each reaches its full height and fulfills its nature—who possesses them?
Thus it is said: "They live without possession."
Nurturing the ten thousand things without tyranny, bestowing blessings for ten thousand generations without claiming benevolence, covering and bearing heaven and earth, carving and shaping all forms without asserting skill—thus it is said: "They act without reliance."
The movement of the four seasons—when their work is done, they depart. This is the Way of Heaven.
The sage embodies this, so though his merit covers the world, it seems not to originate from himself. To claim and possess it would be delusion.
Thus it is said: "He accomplishes without abiding."
To abide is to depart—this has been so from ancient times to the present.
If nothing abides within oneself, nothing can displace it. Coming is timely; going is in accord. What is added or diminished?
Thus it is said: "Only by not abiding does one not depart."

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Worthy**

Not exalting the worthy keeps the people from contention.
Not prizing rare goods keeps the people from theft.
Exalting the worthy breeds cunning, leading to great turmoil in the world, with Confucians and Mohists all arising.
Prizing goods breeds desire, leading to theft at broad daylight and burrowing through walls at noon.
Not exalting the worthy allows the people to settle into their allotted nature, without striving beyond their station—thus they do not contend.
Not prizing goods allows the people to rest in the truth of their nature, without covetousness—thus they do not steal.
*Zhuangzi* says: "Cut off the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, and the world’s virtue will begin to achieve profound unity."
*The Lü Traveler* says: "Do not prize exotic things; value useful things, and the people will be sufficient."
Do not display what may be desired, and the heart will not be disordered.
When people have desires, they vie for them according to the truth of their nature, leading to seizing, plundering, deceit, and every kind of excess.
Boyi saw that fame was desirable and starved on Mount Shouyang.
Robber Zhi saw that profit was desirable and raged beneath the eastern mound.
Their heat scorched like fire; their cold congealed like ice. Thus their hearts were agitated, restless, and arrogant, unable to be bound to the Dao.
As for the sage—he does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in longevity, does not grieve over early death, is not honored by success, is not shamed by poverty. What, then, is desirable?
With desires and thoughts unaroused, his heart is serene. Stimulated, he responds; at rest, he is unobstructed. In motion, he is not pursued. Who can disorder him?
Confucius at forty was without confusion; Mencius said, "At forty, my heart did not waver."
Thus the sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones, always keeping the people without knowledge and without desire.
The valley is empty and thus responds; the mirror is empty and thus reflects; the pipe and lock are empty and thus receive. The ear is empty and thus can hear; the eye is empty and thus can see; the nose is empty and thus can smell.
If something is full within, it obstructs these.
The sage, compelled to oversee the world, regards all with impartial kindness, values the near and promotes the distant, follows what is naturally so, and leaves things to themselves. What room is there for personal intent?
Yao’s elevation of Shun and employment of Gun nearly achieved this.
An empty heart allows impartial hearing and observation, without the passions of like and dislike. A full belly brings sufficiency and tranquility, without the craving for gain. How could the worthy be exalted, or goods be prized?
The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—the belly has no preferences and thus contains all.
The will is what the heart knows; the bones are what the body stands upon.
A strong will may lead to endless pursuit of fame, or insatiable chase of goods, or boasting of merit, or pride in ability—ever farther from the Dao.
Weak bones lead to drifting conduct, clashing and grinding with things, all sinking together without return.
The sage’s will always humbles itself, yet others exalt it. It always lags behind, yet others put it first.
Knowing the male, he guards the female; knowing honor, he keeps to disgrace—this is called weakening the will.
With correctness, he halts it—nothing can displace it. With firmness, he holds it—no change can topple it.
In the unbroken state, like Guangchengzi, he lived twelve hundred years without his form ever declining—this is called strengthening the bones.
*Zhuangzi* says: "Awaiting without knowledge, his virtue does not depart. Aligning with non-desire, this is called plain simplicity."
In plain simplicity, the people’s nature is preserved.
The sage’s governance aims only to let the people preserve their nature.
Excessive knowledge harms the allotment of nature; excessive desire muddies the truth of nature. To call this governance is to grasp at chaos.
Thus he always keeps the people without knowledge and without desire.
He ensures that the knowing dare not act.
The eloquent dare not flaunt their words; the brave dare not display their boldness; the capable dare not boast their talents; the wise dare not deploy their discernment. Those who cultivate cleverness and pursue cunning, who multiply laws and decrees to overawe the multitude—the sage prohibits and halts them all.
This is what is called "ensuring that the knowing dare not act."

The Nine Offices all fulfill their duties, ensuring long service in their roles—how could this be achieved by carving with knowledge? Carrying out the ruler’s commands and delivering them to the people suffices. By acting through non-action, nothing remains untended.

Does the sage’s governance abandon people and sever ties with things, suddenly establishing itself in a realm of no affairs? It arises from non-action, and that is all. The transformations of the myriad things lie below form, but the sage embodies the Dao, standing above the myriad things, unifying their completion and governing them through principle. When things arise, follow them to observe their return. When things are born, accord with them to bring about their fruition—how could there be anything untended?

Thus, when governance above is well-ordered, the sun, moon, and stars maintain their proper sequence; when governance below is well-ordered, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees fulfill their natures.

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Depth**
The Dao is profound and its use never full. The Dao possesses essence and trust, hence its efficacy; being formless and non-active, it does not fill. The *Classic* states: “The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony.” In the principles of the myriad things, leaning toward yang leads to excess, while leaning toward yin leads to insufficiency. Without excess or insufficiency, this is called the balanced qi. “Balanced” means centered—this is the Great Harmony. The high are brought low, the low are raised, the surplus is taken, and the deficient are given. The Dao’s application never fails to attain the mean.

It is filled yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted. Giving to others, one’s own abundance increases; bestowing upon others, one’s own store grows greater. The Dao’s essence resembles the great void, encompassing the six directions—how could it ever be full? Deep and abstruse, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. *Zhuangzi* says: “The stillness of deep pools makes them abysses; the stillness of still water makes them abysses; the stillness of flowing water makes them abysses.” The abyss is empty and tranquil, unmingled with things—this is the Dao’s essence. Only through emptiness do all actualities return; only through stillness do all movements belong. It is the tether of the myriad things, the awaiting of all transformations. Thus it is said to resemble the ancestor of the myriad things. Yet the Dao itself has no tether—things naturally take it as their ancestor, hence it only *seems* so.

Blunt the sharp, untangle the knots, harmonize the light, merge with the dust. Sharpness wounds, entanglement confuses; blunting sharpness prevents contention, unraveling knots prevents disorder. “Harmonizing the light” is what *Zhuangzi* calls “shining yet not dazzling.” “Merging with the dust” is what *Zhuangzi* calls “flowing with things and moving with their waves.” When inner sincerity remains unbroken, the form’s plans manifest as radiance, and even those who lodge with one rise to yield their seats—is this not what “harmonizing the light” means? Adorning wisdom to startle the foolish, cultivating the self to expose impurity, shining brightly as if bearing aloft the sun and moon—is this not what “merging with the dust” means?

When the sage blunts sharpness, he engages with things without harming them, and nothing can harm him. When he unravels knots, why scheme? Why use cunning? Why glue? Nothing in the myriad things can disturb his heart. Thus he has no arrogance in demeanor, no pride in bearing, harmonious yet not adrift, in great accord with things, connecting with the world’s aspirations—entering nowhere without self-possession.

Profound, it seems as if it exists. The heart like dead ashes, the body like a withered tree’s branch, in perfect stillness, the light of heaven shines of itself—dimly, as if vanished yet present; effortlessly, without form yet spiritually—is this not the Dao?

I do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the image of the Lord. “Image” is the first appearance of things. “Lord” is the spirit’s response to things. After things are born, images arise; after the Lord emerges, things are wondrously transformed. The “image of the Lord” is the beginning of all things, yet the Dao truly precedes it. This is what *Zhuangzi* calls “spirits and gods, the Lord, giving birth to heaven and earth.”

Seeing it, one does not perceive it; hearing it, one does not hear it; grasping it, one does not obtain it. It emerges, yet none see its gate—who knows it? Thus it is said: “I do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the image of the Lord.”

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**
Heaven and earth are not benevolent—they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent—he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs. Favor gives rise to harm, harm gives rise to favor. Regarding benevolence as favor, harm follows closely. Heaven and earth, in relation to the myriad things, and the sage, in relation to the hundred clans, assist their spontaneity without a heart of love or benefit—benevolence cannot be named in this.

Straw bound into dogs, used in sacrifices, employed when fitting, discarded when past—so too the myriad things’ self-generation and the hundred clans’ self-governance. Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? The bellows is empty yet able to receive, receiving yet able to respond—thus it responds without exhaustion. If it were full within, every touch would obstruct, becoming a partiality in the Dao, a fragment in things.

Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever productive. Emptying oneself to wander the world, one responds flexibly and meets every situation—thus it is said, “empty yet inexhaustible.” Pressed, then moving, one measures and does not deplete—thus it is said, “moving yet ever productive.” This is why the sage emerges to respond to emperors and kings without being burdened by words.

Many words lead to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center. The bellows is empty to await qi; when qi arrives, it sounds; when it does not, it stops. The sage’s words resemble this. The eloquent are confined by their words, speaking much yet inevitably burdened—better to guard the center. Guard your inner self, close your outer senses, withdraw your sight and reverse your hearing to once more perceive the heart of heaven and earth—this is called “guarding the center.”

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit**
The valley spirit does not die...

Where there is spirit, there is flourishing and decline; where there is calculation, there is completion and decay. Form and number together determine life and death—such is the principle of all things. The valley responds to all movements yet remains ever empty; the spirit subtly permeates the ten thousand things yet remains ever still. Within this true constancy, it unites with the Dao, neither clinging to form nor bound by calculation. It generates without end, like the sun and moon, which never cease through all ages; like the Northern Dipper, which never falters through all ages—thus it is said to be "undying." This is called the *Mysterious Female*.

The ten thousand things receive their mandate from Nonbeing yet take form in Being. The valley’s function is without appearance; the spirit’s essence is without direction—yet from them the ten thousand things receive their mandate. *Xuan* is the color of heaven; *pin* is the kind of earth—from them the ten thousand things take form. The valley spirit is likened to the constancy of the supreme Dao; the Mysterious Female reveals the marvel of creation.

The gateway of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of heaven and earth. *Zhuangzi* says: "The ten thousand things have that from which they are born, yet none see its root; they have that from which they emerge, yet none see its gate. Those who see it must be sages." Thus it is here made clear: the gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.

Heaven and earth are the above and below of the ten thousand things. Between things and heaven and earth, there is no before or after in origin. Yet when the sequence of the great Dao is made manifest, there is heaven and earth, and only then are there the ten thousand things. That from which heaven and earth themselves emerge is none other than the Mysterious Female. As for that which existed before heaven and earth—who could have seen it? It endures ceaselessly, as if present; its use is never exhausted. From its own root it arises, from ancient times it has firmly endured, its end unknowable. This is what is meant by "enduring ceaselessly, as if present."

Vast and formless, heaven arises; it entrusts itself to the self-movement of the single qi. Sudden and transforming, earth takes shape; it commits itself to the self-propagation of the myriad forms. Qian is easy to know; Kun is simple in its power. It is not by forceful governance—what movement could there be?

**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Abides**
Heaven endures, earth abides. The reason heaven and earth can endure and abide is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can live long.

Heaven arches above, its position on high. Its warp forms the sun and moon; its weft forms the stars. The ten thousand things are covered by it. Earth is vast below, its position beneath. It congeals into mountains and ridges; it melts into rivers and marshes. The ten thousand things are borne by it. The ten thousand things are covered and borne by heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth have no intention toward them. Thus heaven, firm and unyielding, moves constantly; earth, perilous and treacherous, remains steadfast—this is how they can endure and abide.

If heaven had an intention toward living things, then heaven could be measured in an instant, and its covering of things would be shallow. If earth had an intention toward living things, then earth could be fathomed in an instant, and its bearing of things would be thin. If this were so, they would depend on conditions—how could they live long? Therefore the sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; he treats himself as external, yet finds himself preserved.

Heaven moves above; earth abides below. The sage takes his place between heaven and earth. When comprehended as the Three Powers, they have mutually resonant functions. When distinguished as the Three Ultimates, each has its own established essence. When interwoven as the Three Spirits, they possess a spirit that is marvelous without exception. Thus heaven, earth, and the sage all attain the Dao, and the sage’s way of ordering himself is none other than that of heaven and earth.

Therefore this chapter first speaks of heaven and earth not living for themselves, then follows with the sage not possessing himself. All people seek to be first; he alone seeks to be last, saying he receives the world’s filth—this is called placing himself behind. Placing himself behind, he does not contend with things, and none in the world can contend with him—thus it is said, "places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead." On the road, he does not contend for the advantage of smooth or rough terrain; in winter and summer, he does not contend for the harmony of yin and yang. He puts death and life beyond concern, leaves misfortune and fortune behind, and his spirit is never troubled—this is called treating himself as external, yet finding himself preserved.

The sage’s way of ordering himself is thus—how much more so for things beyond himself? He encounters them without resistance, passes them without attachment, embodying his nature and embracing his spirit to wander among the common world. His form will right itself; things and self become one. He existed before heaven and earth, yet is not thereby long-lived; he endures from high antiquity, yet is not thereby old—such is his efficacy!

Is it not because he is without self-interest that he can perfect his self-interest? The great virtue of heaven and earth is called life; the great treasure of the sage is called position. The Dao makes them public. Heaven and earth embody the Dao, thus they are without self-interest; being without self-interest, they endure long. The sage embodies the Dao, thus he is without self-interest; being without self-interest, he is ever preserved. Those who act for their own sake have never been able to perfect their own sake.

**Chapter Eight: The Highest Good Is Like Water**
The highest good is like water.

The *Book of Changes* states: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao; that which continues it is goodness." Zhuangzi says: "To depart from the Dao for the sake of goodness—once the name of goodness is established, the substance of the Dao is diminished." Yet when heaven gives birth to water, it does not depart far from the Dao. Profound and empty, still and luminous, this is called the most refined essence under heaven—thus the highest good is like water.

Water benefits the myriad things without contention, dwelling where the multitude disdains, and so nearly approaches the Dao. It melts into rain and dew, nourishing all things; it congeals into frost and snow, bringing forth the ten thousand treasures. It flows as rivers and streams, gathers as ponds and marshes; springs run deep, seas stretch vast, drawing forth and storing, enriching all. It engenders and sustains the myriad things, all of which turn to it without exhaustion. In benefiting the myriad things, does it not hold fast to goodness here?

In its goodness, it benefits the myriad things, which receive its grace and bounty, yet it ever abides in softness and non-contention, accepting filth and bearing grime without self-regard, unburdened in its heart—thus it is near to the Dao. "Near" means proximity.

Dwelling in good places, it flows through the earth without overflowing. Its heart is good in its depth—measured, it grows deeper; pursued, it grows more distant. In its goodness, it is benevolent, loving all impartially, bestowing without discrimination. In its words, it is good in trustworthiness, avoiding obstacles to reach the seas, traversing peril without losing its constancy. In governance, it is good in order, cleansing the foul, leveling the treacherous, following the principle of things without imposing its will—thus nothing is left ungoverned. In affairs, it is good in ability, bending or straightening according to the land, shaping square or round according to the vessel, adapting to change without fixed form, yet ever constant—can the incapable be thus? In movement, it is good in timing. When yang dissolves, it accompanies; when yin congeals, it freezes. Directed east, it flows east; released west, it flows west—moving without constraint, fitting itself to the moment alone.

Only by not contending does it remain without blame. The sage embodies the Dao to govern the self, preserving long endurance. Embracing goodness, it benefits all, dwelling where things do not contend.

Zhuangzi says: "Is it easy to possess and act upon?" To alter it is to howl against heaven, which is not fitting. To act without doing and err little is easy; to act and remain without harm is difficult. Having benefited things and acted, to remain without blame is indeed difficult. The highest good benefits things as water does by nature—though it benefits things, it does not choose whom to benefit, nor contend with them, and nothing can contend with it—thus it remains without blame.

Therefore it is said: "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it."

**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**
To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping. To sharpen and point it cannot be long preserved. When full, it spills; when sharp, it breaks. The principle of the myriad things is that fullness must lead to loss. Not knowing to hold back and place oneself last, to grasp emptiness to control fullness, but instead sinking into the desire for excess—this is to increase the calamity of collapse. Thus it is better to stop.

The changes of things are endless, while human wisdom is finite. Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly. To gauge the nature of things and press forward sharply—wisdom will at times be exhausted. Can it be long preserved?

Gold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them. Wealth and nobility breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune. Gold and jade, wealth and honor are not the principle of life and destiny; they are external things, unreliable and transient. Those who treasure gold and jade are burdened by things. Burdened by things, can they avoid loss? Thus none can guard them. Wealth and honor leading to arrogance harm virtue. Those who harm virtue—can they escape calamity? Thus they invite their own retribution.

The sage does not cling to the world’s benefits as private gain, nor does he take ruling all under heaven as his own exalted position. How could he regard gold and jade as treasures or wealth and honor as burdens? Thus the wealth of the state is amassed without limit, its nobility unrivaled, its riches unparalleled, yet the Dao remains unchanged.

When merit is accomplished and fame achieved, withdraw—this is the Way of Heaven. When merit is complete, it declines; when fame is achieved, it wanes. The sun reaches its zenith and turns back; the moon waxes full and then wanes—this is the principle of things. The sage perceives the mutual dependence of completion and decay, recognizes the numerical order of fullness and emptiness, and transcends all with self-possession, unburdened by things, free from the peril of arrogance and excess. Who but one who knows Heaven can attain this?

Thus it is said: "When merit is accomplished and fame achieved, withdraw—this is the Way of Heaven." The movement of the four seasons—when their work is done, they depart. This is the Way of Heaven.

To know advance but not retreat, to know existence but not demise, to know gain but not loss—can one avoid regret? Yi Yin said: "Your servant does not dwell in success through favor or profit."

**Chapter Ten: Embracing the Spirit**

**Chapter Ten: Embracing the Spirit (continued)**

The *pò* pertains to yin; it clings to the body and has its limits—thus the Old Master speaks of "nurturing" the *pò*. The *hún* pertains to yang; it lodges in *qi* and knows no bounds—thus the *Book of Changes* speaks of the *hún* "roaming." The sage governs form with spirit and restrains the *pò* with the *hún*, so that spirit ever bears the *pò* yet is not borne by the *hún*—like a chariot conveying all things, like the seasons carrying cold and heat in their course.

The heart roams the heavens, the six senses interpenetrate; beyond Heaven and Earth, beyond the myriad things, spirit is never constrained—how could it be fettered by the *pò*? Embrace the One—can you remain undivided?

Heaven’s One generates water, which in things becomes essence. Earth’s Two generates fire, which in things becomes spirit. Spirit and essence arise from the Dao; form fundamentally arises from essence. Guard them without loss, unite with spirit as one, and essence and spirit merge inseparably.

Gather spirit with essence, employ form with spirit, preserve spirit with form. When essence is whole and unharmed, spirit is used yet never exhausted; form lives yet never decays—like the sun and moon clinging to the heavens, like grasses and trees clinging to the earth, never parting.

Let me elaborate: When a person is born, essence gathers spirit, and bodily form takes shape. The four directions flow unimpeded, reaching everywhere, above touching Heaven, below coiling upon Earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond all imagery—this is called "equal to the Lord." Yet the foolish of the world enslave themselves to things, lose their nature to custom, never for a moment inwardly preserving spirit, chasing endless desires and outwardly squandering essence. The *hún* returns to clods of earth, form burdens spirit, and they descend to be transformed with the myriad things—is this not delusion?

The sage is not so. Bearing the *pò* to communicate, embracing the One to guard, embodying spirit in stillness—form will right itself. His spirit traverses Mount Tai without change, dwells in abyssal springs without wetting—who knows its beginning, who knows its end? Thus it is said: the sage values essence.

Concentrate *qi* to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? The *Book of Changes* says: "In its stillness, *qián* is concentrated." Yang Xiong said: "Harmony and suppleness suffice to pacify things." Stillness without admixture is called concentration; harmony without alteration is called suppleness. The infant abides without knowing what to do, moves without knowing where to go, harboring no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—thus its *qi* is concentrated and attains suppleness.

Mencius said: "The stumbler and the hastener—this is *qi*—yet it disturbs the heart. If the heart is insufficient to concentrate *qi*, then *qi* stumbles and hastens amiss, and the heart reaches recklessness and arrogance beyond restraint." The sage empties himself to wander the world, his heart never forcing *qi* with strength. Thus his stillness is without admixture, his harmony without violence—how does he differ from an infant? Hence it is said: can you be like an infant?

Mencius said: "This *qi* is most great, most firm; nurtured with uprightness and unharmed, it fills the space between Heaven and Earth." Yet the Old Master’s "concentration of *qi*" speaks of attaining suppleness—why? The utmost firmness acts with righteousness; attaining suppleness restores nature. The ancient Dao’s unfolding is present everywhere.

Purify and contemplate the mysterious—can you be without flaw? The sage washes his heart with this, cleansing all conduct without possession. Retreating to conceal himself in secrecy, he silently comprehends the wondrous principle. Thus his substance is pure and unburdened; though he errs, he does not regret; though he acts rightly, he does not congratulate himself—what flaw could there be?

Love the people and govern the state—can you practice non-action? With benevolence to love the people, with wisdom to govern the state, enacting teachings and refining laws to bring goodness to the age—this is far from non-action. The sage’s beneficence flows through the ages without loving others; his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own—thus he practices non-action, employing the world with abundance.

The gate of Heaven opens and closes—can you remain feminine? The classic says: "Know the masculine, keep to the feminine, and be the world’s valley." The sage embodies Heaven’s transformations, coiling and unfolding, opening and closing, never opposing the seasons. Subtle or manifest, soft or hard—only as needed. Yet he never precedes others, always following; never overcomes things, always yielding to them. Thus the world delights in exalting him without tiring—here lies the feminine.

Understanding the four directions—can you be without knowledge? Wisdom, sagacity, and saintly intelligence—guarded with foolishness—share this meaning.

"Giving life and nurturing, giving life without possessing, acting without relying, growing without ruling—this is called profound virtue." The sage preserves spirit and knows transformation, uniting with the Dao in body. Thus he matches the divine luminaries, nurtures the myriad things, and nothing is beyond him.

He gives life to fulfill their nature, nurtures to perfect their sustenance. Without a heart of love or profit, he gives life without possessing. Without conduct of pride or boasting, he acts without relying. Without artifice of carving or control, he grows without ruling. Such is his virtue—profound and far-reaching, returning to things—thus it is called "profound virtue."

The Dao of Heaven ascends in the north and diverges from things. Yet "profound" is Heaven’s color; the sage’s Dao descends to become virtue—nothing but the profound suffices to name it.

**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**

Thirty spokes share one hub; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel lies. Clay is molded to make a vessel; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies. Doors and windows are cut to make a room; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies. Thus being and non-being form a unity: utility arises from non-being. This is called the utmost spirit.

Being and non-being have different aspects: being is the body, non-being is the function. This is the operation of yin and yang, the principle of the myriad things. The wheel’s use lies in movement, the vessel’s use lies in containment, the room’s use lies in emptiness. Wondrous function emerges from utmost non-being; transformation is stored in non-attachment. Like a mirror without image, it reflects things as they appear. The perfected person’s use of the heart always unfolds from this.

Thus, being is for benefit, while non-being is for function? Being is fullness, non-being is emptiness—fullness possesses form, image, sound, and color, and thus has substance; emptiness can circulate, measure, respond, and intoxicate without exhaustion. Between heaven and earth, the Dao is revealed through vessels; thus, non-being does not discard being, while vessels, through the Dao’s wonder, must return to non-being. Wood bends and water moistens, fire blazes and metal hardens, earth levels and spreads—from it sprouts the harvest; this is being, upon which people rely for benefit. Yet who presides over heaven’s movement, earth’s abiding, the four seasons’ procession, and the flourishing of the myriad things? This is non-being. The world does not perceive its traces, and so its function never fails.

Being and non-being give rise to each other. The Old Master, in these three aspects, expounded and illuminated them.

**Five Colors (Chapter Twelve)**
The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears. The eye encloses two apertures—what it sees is nature; when it penetrates to clarity, it becomes wisdom, sufficient to resolve the world’s doubts. The ear conceals one aperture—what it hears is nature; when it penetrates to acuity, it becomes counsel, sufficient to comprehend the world’s aspirations. Those who perceive the Dao, above formless things, see solely with spirit; beyond soundless things, hear solely with qi. Since seeing and hearing need not rely on the eyes and ears, how can sound and color ever obscure them? Yet the world’s people enslave their eyes and ears to external burdens—thus, the eyes indulge in the five colors, the ears in the five tones, and their clarity and acuity decline. How do they differ from blindness and deafness?

The five flavors dull the palate; galloping and hunting madden the heart. The Dao’s emergence from the mouth is bland, as if without taste. The five flavors are what all people crave, yet rich flavors are truly poison—thus they dull the palate. Human life: the body does not fill a fathom, yet the heart roams with creation. The sage’s heart, in motion, weaves the ten thousand directions; in stillness, mirrors heaven and earth. Yet the world’s people pursue hunting and thereby lose their innate goodness, unable to master themselves—can this not be called great sorrow?

Rare goods hinder conduct. Profit nourishes people, but goods transform them—thus, mutual profit leads to mutual harm. The sage does not value rare goods or strange objects, deeming common things precious, desiring people to rest in their lot and not be deprived. To prize rare goods is to reach the point of severing the passions of life and limb, becoming gluttonous and avaricious—how can one’s conduct remain intact? Thus, they hinder conduct. When Zhong Hui praised Tang, he said: "He did not amass goods or profit." When Confucius spoke to Zigong, he said: "Ci did not accept his fate and instead amassed goods." Such is the way goods hinder conduct.

Therefore, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—thus, he discards that and selects this. In the Eight Trigrams, *Kun* represents the belly, which thickly bears and contains. *Li* represents the eyes, which gaze outward and illuminate. Thickly bearing and containing, nothing is not received; gazing outward and illuminating, there is always something missed. The sage takes the world as his measure, thus choosing this belly that can contain—he does not govern every affair or scrutinize every thing. Therefore, he discards that outward-gazing eye. As *Zhuangzi* says: "No thief is greater than virtue; having a heart, the heart has eyes"—thus, the sage discards it.

**Honor and Disgrace (Chapter Thirteen)**
Honor and disgrace are like alarm; valuing great calamity is like valuing the body. Honor lies below, value lies above—dwelling in honor and taking it as glory brings disgrace. Occupying high position and taking it as a burden, no calamity is greater. Those who take wealth as right cannot decline emolument; those who take fame as right cannot decline renown. Those who cling to power cannot share authority—grasping it, they tremble; releasing it, they grieve. Is this not why honor and disgrace are like alarm?

Grievous illness and serene ease alternate in the body; oppressive fear and joyful delight flood the heart. Is this not why great calamity is like valuing the body?

What is meant by "honor and disgrace are like alarm"? Honor is lowly. The dragon, as a creature, transforms freely and cannot be controlled or domesticated—yet if one seeks to tame it, this is the way of disgrace. The ancients who were good as scholars held ranks of three banners, yet these were insufficient to alter their integrity; emoluments of ten thousand bushels were insufficient to shift their resolve. Dwelling in honor and contemplating danger, abiding in fortune and acting as if in peril—what disgrace could there be? The greedy covet rank; the envious covet emolument. Knowing advance but not retreat, knowing gain but not loss—thus, people despise them. Therefore, receiving honor from others is the way of the lowly.

Gaining it is like alarm; losing it is like alarm—this is called "honor and disgrace are like alarm." Chariots and caps on the body are not the principle of life and destiny. Things that come by chance are lodged—what comes cannot be refused, so the perfected person does not rejoice in gain. What departs cannot be prevented, so the perfected person does not grieve over loss. Yet if one is displeased when the lodging leaves and delighted when receiving it, then gain and loss burden the heart—how can one not be alarmed? When Liuxia Hui served as chief judge, he was dismissed three times yet did not leave; when Zheng Kaofu received three appointments, he walked along the wall—these were different from this.

What is meant by "valuing great calamity is like valuing the body"? Grasping profit and power, monopolizing rewards and punishments, wielding fortune and might—when the world fears them like spirits and honors them like Heaven, this can be called "valued." Yet the sage does not burden himself with value, and so can long preserve it without end. It is like a person’s body: if limbs are cast off, hearing and sight are abandoned, form is left behind and wisdom is gone, merging with the great unity, then there is no entry where one does not find contentment. The world’s people exchange their nature for things, thus burdened by things and unable to forget power; their form burdens their heart, thus losing their heart and unable to forget their form—how great is their calamity!

The reason I suffer great calamity is that I have a body. If I were without a body, what calamity could I have? When a person is born, they possess a hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—all complete within them. Yet whom can I claim as truly close? To recognize and possess them is all delusion.

Those who embody the Dao understand this, which is why Confucius said, "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die that evening without regret." Mencius said, "Whether one dies young or lives long, one remains unwavering." Yanzi said, "Hui has forgotten himself in sitting meditation." Life and death are indeed momentous, yet they bring no change to the self—how much less do gain and loss, fortune and misfortune affect one? This is why the utmost person of antiquity did not allow profit to burden their form, nor their form to burden their heart. They regarded the myriad things and themselves as indistinguishable, so that even the attempt to choose between them became impossible—thus, their body was not their own. Above, they roamed with the Creator; below, they befriended those who treated life and death as one, beginning and end as equal. What calamity could they have?

Moreover, favor is what the world honors, yet they took it as disgrace; rank is what people delight in, yet they saw it as calamity. This is because external things cannot be relied upon—the principle is inherently so. If one truly possesses them as if possessing nothing, then though favored, one is not disgraced; though exalted, one suffers no calamity. Yi Yin did not dwell on success through favor or profit, and Yao did not find joy in his position—these come close to such understanding.

Thus, one who values their body as if it were the world may be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their body as if it were the world may be confided with the world. The world is a great vessel, which none but the Dao can set in motion; it is a sacred vessel, which none but the Dao can preserve. The sage embodies the Dao, and so governs the world by letting it be—thus, the world delights in following and never grows weary.

Those of the next rank know to value their bodies and do not debase themselves to be enslaved by things—they may be entrusted with matters. Those who know to cherish their bodies and do not debase themselves to be troubled by things may be confided with matters. Thus it is said: The essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants are for governing the state; its dregs are for ordering the world. Yet the worldly gentlemen of today risk their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable?

**Chapter Fourteen: "What is Seen Cannot Be Discerned"**
What is seen yet cannot be discerned is called *yí*—level and without distinction, beyond the reach of sight, hence named *yí*. The Supreme Simplicity before manifestation is but qi.

What is heard yet cannot be perceived is called *xī*—vague and intermittent, beyond the reach of hearing, hence named *xī*. The great sound is soundless.

What cannot be grasped is called *wēi*—so subtle as to be formless, who could seize it? The great image is without form.

These three cannot be further questioned, so they merge into one. Before the Supreme Simplicity divided, who could distinguish high from low? The great sound is soundless—who could discern clear from turbid? The great image is formless—who could judge large from small? The eye has no use for its clarity, the ear no need for its acuity, the form no cause to exhaust its strength—the entire body of the Dao resides herein. It cannot be fathomed or grasped.

Qi, form, and substance exist together yet remain undivided, so they merge into one. Yet even as they become one, can one remain silent? Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. That which is above form—yin and yang unfathomable, profound and hard to know—is called the utmost spirit, hence not bright. That which is below form—one yin, one yang, distinct and numbered—is called the utmost Dao, hence not dark.

As the *Book of Changes* says, "To make it spiritual and luminous depends on the person." Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—it returns to nothingness. The body of the Dao is like the constancy of day and night, yet its depths of darkness and light cannot be fathomed. How could it be captured in appearance, sound, or form? Thus, it returns to nothingness. This is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless—this is called *huǎnghū*.

The form of the formless, the image of the imageless—dimly, vaguely, yet within it there is something. Vaguely, dimly, yet within it there is an image. Like the great void containing all images yet revealing no trace, like the single spirit abiding in wisdom yet defying all inquiry—call it being yet it is not being, call it non-being yet it is not non-being. As the sun and moon are distant from man, yet when one seeks them with a mirror or burning glass, water and fire come of themselves—where, then, do water and fire truly reside? The form of the formless, the image of the imageless, are likewise.

One meets it yet sees not its head; one follows it yet sees not its rear. It has no beginning, no end—thus, whether meeting or following, one cannot see it. Hold to the Dao of old to master the present. To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

The Dao is called "one yin, one yang." Those who follow Heaven and reject Earth may be blinded by the Dao’s movement and rely on its strong yang. Those who follow yin and reject yang may drown in the Dao’s stillness and stagnate in withered desolation. Those who act for themselves abandon benevolence; those who act for others abandon righteousness—how could this be the Dao of old? The Dao of old cannot be questioned yet is not being; it is called *huǎnghū* yet is not nothingness. Holding to it to govern the world, one adapts and exhausts its benefits, rouses and exhausts its spirit—nothing is impossible. The great constancy of the Dao is unchanging in this. Is this not what has existed since ancient times?

Thus it is said: To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

**Chapter Fifteen: "The Skilled Gentlemen of Old"**
The skilled gentlemen of old were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—too deep to be known. The gentlemen of old differed from those of today, and the skilled differed from the unskilled.

Thus, subtlety made them one with the Dao; wonder made them of the same body as the spirit. Their profundity matched Heaven; their penetration foretold sageliness. Yet their hidden use was so deep as to be unfathomable.

The *Book of Documents* states: "The mind of the Dao is most subtle"—thus subtlety is the Dao. The *Book of Changes* states: "The spirit is that which is wondrous in all things"—thus wonder is the spirit. The *Book of Changes* states: "Heaven is dark and earth is yellow"—thus darkness is the color of Heaven. The *Commentary* states: "To be unobstructed in all affairs is called sageliness"—thus penetration is the work of the sage.

The depths of water can be measured; the depths of a cave can be fathomed. Yet the skilled gentlemen of old, subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating, did not rely on names or appearances—yet their mechanism arose from the very soles of their feet. Their concealment was so deep as to be unfathomable.

Lie Yukou dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, and no one recognized him. Laozi said to Confucius: "A good merchant hides his wealth as if empty; a gentleman of great virtue appears simple in countenance—is this not what is meant?" Only because they cannot be known do we force descriptions upon them.

The height of Heaven cannot be measured in an instant; the depth of Earth cannot be sounded in a moment. When we say "round to cover" and "square to bear," we merely sketch their forms. Forcing descriptions—how can this truly grasp their essence?

Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter; cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides. Hesitation means planning against what has not yet come to pass. Caution means doubting what one has already undertaken. Those of old who embodied the Dao made inner wandering their task, not delighting in external mastery. Fearful and vigilant, they responded only when unavoidable—like crossing a river in winter, holding fast without losing themselves. Like fearing one’s neighbors, this is what the *Book of Changes* calls "fasting the mind."

Solemn in demeanor. As the *Analects* says: "Seen from afar, he appears grave." The *Records* says: "Solemn as if in thought." *Zhuangzi* says: "When things lack the Dao, rectify your bearing to awaken them, so that others’ intentions dissolve." The man of perfect virtue, when distant, inspires awe; when near, is never tiresome. Thus his appearance is righteous yet not clannish.

Dispersing like ice about to melt. Water congeals into ice, ice melts into water—essentially one body. Those blinded by clinging to one are like frozen water; those attuned to great unity are like melting ice. The *Book of Changes* says: "Dispersion is separation." Abandoning things, leaving people behind, free from all entanglements—this is dispersion.

Simple, as if uncarved wood. Simplicity is the utmost thickness. Nature is fundamentally thick, like wood in its raw state, not yet carved into vessels.

Vast, as if an empty valley. Vastness is the extreme of breadth. The mind’s origin is boundless, like a valley’s emptiness—receptive and responsive.

Turbid, as if muddy. Not chiseling to appear refined, not forcing extremes to seem extraordinary—merely turbid in its wholeness. This differs from those who cultivate themselves to expose impurities.

Who can make the turbid still and slowly clear? Who can make the tranquil move and slowly come to life? The man of the Dao, though active, is still; though swift, returns to his root. Composed yet responsive, utterly empty yet meeting all demands. Thus stillness slowly clarifies, and nothing can muddy him; movement slowly quickens, and nothing can disturb him.

The *Book of Changes* says: "Coming slowly, slowly"—slow means moving at ease, naturally content. The perfected one’s use of the mind does not prize stillness as good nor intentionally seek it; does not claim movement as achievement nor strive for it. Following what is inherently so, entrusting it to its natural course, without anxiety or haste—thus it is called "slow." Stillness slowly clarifies, and nothing can mirror his heart—who then can muddy him? Movement slowly quickens, and nothing can bind his thoughts—who then can disturb him? Disturbance implies fixation, being bound by things—then how can one respond without harm?

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness. To accumulate is to lack; to store nothing is to have surplus. The perfected one has no accumulation—merely emptiness. Preserving this Dao while claiming all the world’s beauty as one’s own is already petty—thus they do not desire fullness.

The *Classic* says: "The greatest whiteness seems sullied; the fullest virtue seems insufficient." Only by not being full can one endure, not newly complete. Wear leads to renewal; completion leads to ruin. New and old alternate like the four seasons; completion and decay follow one another like the myriad things. From the Dao descending to forms and numbers, none are exempt. Only the Dao is formless, empty yet not full—thus it can endure and renew, complete and decay, transcending forms and numbers, never truly worn, never truly ruined. Thus it is said: Only by not being full can one endure, not newly complete.

Trees begin in splendor and end in withering; fire begins bright and ends extinguished—because they are new, decay follows. The sun reaches its zenith and turns back; the moon becomes full and wanes—because they are complete, ruin follows. The man of the Dao differs from this.

**Chapter Sixteen: "Attaining the Utmost Emptiness"**
Attain utmost emptiness; guard perfect stillness. Nothing is more precious than emptiness; nothing is better than stillness. Emptiness and stillness are the root of the myriad things. Empty, one can receive all realities; still, one can respond to all movements.

"Utmost" means the convergence of all things reaching their limit. "Perfect" means vigorous practice reaching its fulfillment. Striving for emptiness and pressing toward its limit, guarding stillness and attaining its perfection—then though the ten thousand forms are complex, my mind remains clear; though the ten thousand changes are diverse, my mind remains tranquil. This is called the joy of Heaven—only those who embody the Dao can partake in it.

The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The changes of the myriad things lie at the end of the Dao; those who embody the Dao dwell above them. Things are born from some beginning and end in some return. As they arise together and rush toward the path of movement and emergence, I observe that the moving must become still, the emergent must return—and thus perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth. Engaging with things without being transformed with them—this is called observing their return.

The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root.
"Flourishing" is the image of movement and emergence. All things emerge from *Zhen* (Thunder), meet in *Li* (Fire), then burst forth together, their essence and brilliance radiating outward. Delighting in *Dui* (Lake) and laboring in *Kan* (Water), they shed their blossoms to embrace reality, returning to the dwelling of their nature. Destiny is the foundation of nature, and nature is its root. Essence is the mother of spirit, and spirit is its child. When essence is whole, spirit reigns; when nature is fully realized, one attains destiny. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering destiny.

Movement persists to generate things. When things are born and principles take form, this is called shape. The shape embodies spirit, each following its own pattern—this is called nature. Before form exists, there is distinction, yet it remains unquestioned—this is called destiny. Destiny spans past and present, ever abiding; nature transforms through myriad forms yet remains unchanged. Can those who preserve their embodied life do so by forsaking wisdom? Thus, returning to quiescent stability, one knows destiny lies within, just as spring and summer inevitably give way to autumn and winter.

Embodying nature and embracing spirit, one examines oneself within—this is called recovering destiny. Recovering destiny is called constancy. Constancy is the term opposed to change; when one recovers destiny, the myriad changes cannot alter it. Without gap or cessation, one unites with the Dao, grasping Heaven and Earth, inheriting the Mother of *qi*. Knowing constancy is called illumination. One who knows the constancy of the Dao is not swayed by things. Thus, the six penetrations mutually arise, sufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth, sufficient to illumine the myriad things.

Those who do not know constancy act recklessly and court misfortune. The sage knows the constancy of the Dao, thus their actions accord with principle, ever meeting with good fortune. Those who do not know constancy drift with things, stumbling into trouble at every turn. They mistakenly perceive beauty and ugliness, opposing the Dao; they recklessly generate right and wrong, diverging from the Dao. They cannot secure their destiny—hence misfortune. As the *Yi* says: "Returning prevents recklessness; to be lost and not return—this is recklessness indeed."

Knowing constancy brings capacity.
Knowing constancy, one harbors no right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—thus nothing is excluded.
Capacity leads to impartiality.
Without partiality, one does not favor their own kin nor cherish only their own children—what selfishness remains?
Impartiality leads to kingship.
When the great Dao prevails, the world is held in common—thus the world joyfully upholds its ruler without weariness.
Kingship leads to Heaven, Heaven leads to the Dao.
One who unites Heaven, Earth, and humanity, dwelling at their center, is a king. One who is singular and great, above all yet covering all, is Heaven. That by which Heaven, Earth, and humanity are all guided is the Dao.
Fulfilling humanity aligns one with Heaven; embodying Heaven aligns one with the Dao.
The Dao endures.
The Dao knows no decay through the ages. All things that attain it flourish; it sustains a hundred sages without exhaustion, veils Heaven and Earth without ceasing—thus one who embodies it remains free from peril until death. Peril borders on misfortune; nearness borders on good fortune. Without peril, there is no reckless misfortune—only those who know constancy partake in this.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**
The highest: those below merely know of its existence.
Governing the world with freedom, one attains serene indifference in an age. Without exuberant joy, yet affection and praise do not reach them; without weary suffering, yet fear and insult do not approach. Nothing is done, yet all remains naturally so—thus those below merely know of its existence.

Next: they are cherished and praised.
Bestowing blessings upon the people, transmitting laws to the world, the realm loves them as parents—thus they are cherished. Their noble name rises like the sun and moon—thus they are praised. This is the governance of emperors and kings. As affection and praise grow prominent, the Dao of Great Unity wanes. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Shun had a rank odor, yet the people delighted in him." The *Ode to the Spirit Terrace* speaks of how the people first rallied to King Wen.

Next: they are feared and insulted.
Ruling with policies, ordering with punishments—thus they are feared. Rewarding the entire world does not encourage the good; punishing the entire world does not deter the wicked. When feudal lords inquire about the weight of the tripods like the Lord of Chu, or ministers steal treasures like Yang Hu, these are the customs of a declining age—thus they are insulted.

Thus, when trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
Attachment without glue or lacquer, restraint without ropes—this is perfect trust. When the Shang people swore oaths, the people began to rebel; when the Zhou people held assemblies, the people began to doubt—this was due to insufficient trust. When the highest is merely known to exist, conduct is proper yet trust is not consciously relied upon. When rulers are feared and insulted, cunning and deceit arise, and distrust emerges.

How solemnly they value their words!
Viewed through the Dao, when the world’s rulers are upright, how can words be taken lightly? One is cautious and dares not treat them lightly. Thus, when words are spoken, the world follows the Dao; when words arise from oneself, the world is transformed. When tasks are accomplished and affairs settled, the people all say, "We are naturally so." The achievements of emperors and kings are the surplus of sages. Making the people savor their food, admire their clothing, feel secure in their customs, and delight in their work—this surplus suffices to complete the work of emperors and kings. Yet they say, "What has imperial power to do with us?" This is the governance of the highest.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Decay of the Great Dao**
When the great Dao decays, benevolence and righteousness arise.
Losing the Dao, then virtue; losing virtue, then benevolence; losing benevolence, then righteousness. Benevolence establishes others; righteousness establishes oneself—yet they are far removed from the Dao. Han Yu did not fathom the intent of the sages’ Dao and virtue, instead claiming benevolence and righteousness as fixed terms while Dao and virtue were empty positions. Laozi’s critique of petty benevolence and righteousness reveals his limited vision—what *Zhuangzi* calls "the benighted people."

When wisdom and cleverness emerge, great falsity arises.
When the people’s strength is exhausted, they resort to deceit. When the six relations are disharmonious, filial piety and compassion appear; when the state is dark and chaotic, loyal ministers emerge. Names arise from insufficiency.

Zhuangzi said: The filial son does not flatter his parents; the loyal minister does not deceive his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial devotion.

**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**
Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.
The Dao endows them with nature, unified and unadulterated. To depart from the Dao and establish virtue is called sagacity and wisdom.
Once sagacity and wisdom arise, the world begins to see lofty, convoluted, and ostentatious conduct—startling the foolish and enlightening the benighted, praising Yao and condemning Jie. Thus, the benefits of sagacity and wisdom to the world are few, while their harms are many.
Abandon and discard them, uniting with the Dao in essence, and each will rest in the truth of their nature and destiny. The benefits will be boundless.

Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.
Filial piety and compassion are innate to nature. To strain and exert oneself is called benevolence; to stand on tiptoe and strive is called righteousness—yet through benevolence and righteousness, one exchanges one’s nature.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will revert to their nature and recover their original state. They will not merely cherish their own kin nor merely nurture their own children—how then could filial piety and compassion be lacking?

Abandon craftiness, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will cease to exist.
Those who devise cunning schemes have no use for shame. Those with desires for profit disregard righteousness—all belong to the class of thieves and burglars.
These three—when used as adornments—are insufficient, so they are made subordinate to something greater.

The former kings governed the world by the human Dao. By the time of the Zhou, ornamentation had grown excessive. When its flaws emerged, ornamentation overwhelmed substance. Ornamentation became excessive while substance was lacking, and the world entirely lost its original simplicity, daily sinking into the habits of private desire.
Laozi, living at the end of the Zhou, sought to loosen its flaws and return it to its root. Thus, he cast aside benevolence and righteousness, abolished ritual and learning, and even sagacity and wisdom were to be rejected.
Did he truly believe that benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom were insufficient to govern the world? The Dao of the former kings is like a cycle: to remedy ornamentation, nothing surpasses substance. Thus, he made them subordinate, meaning to "see plainness and embrace simplicity, lessen selfishness and reduce desires."

"See plainness"—as the *Analects* says: "Painting comes after plainness." Plainness has not yet received color; to see plainness is to be pure and unadulterated.
"Embrace simplicity"—as the *Classic* says: "When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels." Simplicity has never been severed; to embrace simplicity is to be tranquil and unified, unchanging.
Zhuangzi said: "To be the same in having no desires is called plainness and simplicity." Through plainness and simplicity, the people’s nature is attained.

"Lessen selfishness, reduce desires."
Self-interest is selfishness, and nothing is better for nurturing the heart than reducing desires.
Lessen selfishness, reduce desires, and one will settle the distinction between internal and external, discern the return of truth and falsehood. Virtue will be complete, nature restored, and the names of sagacity and wisdom will vanish.

**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**
Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow.
Learning is for exhausting principle. While one pursues learning to exhaust principle—weighing thoughts as good or bad, comparing and examining order and chaos—how can there be no sorrow?
Learning is for governing the Dao. To perceive the Dao and abandon learning, reducing and reducing again until reaching non-action yet accomplishing everything, is to follow the truth of one’s nature and destiny. There is no circumstance in which one is not joyful—thus, there is no sorrow.

How far apart are compliance and flattery?
How distant are good and evil?
Compliance and flattery share the same sound; good and evil share the same nature. Petty wisdom, self-interested, divides them into two. The enlightened person, seeing broadly, knows their root is not different.
The sage’s way of ordering the world: in ancestral temples and court, when speaking with ministers, does not distinguish between them in this way. Suppressing evil and promoting good, he fears not doing so thoroughly—this is because what people fear cannot but be feared.

What people fear cannot but be feared.
The Dao sets the myriad things in motion yet does not share the sage’s sorrows.
Good and ill fortune, shared with the people as calamities, are matters.
Those who embody the Dao are without sorrow; those who engage in matters have fears.
If one does not take heed of what people fear, few will be able to avoid exhaustion.
Thus, the noble person cultivates and reflects in fear.

The *Book of Songs* says: "In awe of Heaven’s majesty."
Vast and boundless, its end never comes.
The world’s affairs, with their ten thousand changes, are tangled and ungovernable, difficult to conclude, difficult to exhaust—never reaching an end. What is called good and evil is merely undetermined. Only the enlightened know that all is one.

The multitude bustle and rejoice, as if feasting on grand sacrifices, as if ascending a terrace in spring.
All things flourish in yang and congeal in yin. The bustling and rejoicing are the outward signs of flourishing.
The multitude, having lost the tranquility of their nature, devote themselves to external pursuits—delighting in rich flavors to nourish their bodies, gazing upon lofty splendor to please their minds. Such indulgent pleasure-seekers drift ever farther from the Dao.

I alone am inert, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.
The *Classic* says: "Return to the state of the infant." Zhuangzi said: "Who begins with not yet having learned to smile?"
The infant’s desires and concerns have not yet arisen; joy and sorrow are viewed as one. Inert and still, harmony and compliance accumulate within, while brilliance does not manifest externally—thus, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.

Adrift, as if with no place to return.
The *Book of Changes* says: "Riding the six dragons to govern Heaven."
"Adrift" means following the times and complying with principle, not leaning toward any bias—thus, as if with no place to return.

The multitude all have more than enough.
If one asks the multitude: those who covet wealth and honor, who admire profit, are dominated by extravagant desires while their frugal intentions are faint—thus, they all have more than enough.
In the Dao, this is called "surplus food and redundant conduct."

I alone seem to be lacking.
Achievements cover the world yet seem not to originate from oneself.
Is my heart that of a fool? So pure, so simple.
Confucius said: "When I speak with Yan Hui all day, he does not oppose me, as if foolish." Pure and simple—heavenly mechanism unspread, yet silently in accord with the Dao—this is called great wisdom.

The vulgar are bright; I alone seem dim.
The vulgar are sharp; I alone seem dull.
In conformity with common custom, they consider brightness as clarity—and their clarity is small. They consider sharpness as wisdom—and their wisdom is forced.
Abandoning things, departing from people, and disdaining the world’s habits, one is dim as if lost yet present, dull as if blunt yet keen. How could the vulgar glimpse this?

Vast and still as the sea, profound in tranquility and settled in nature—this is the complete embodiment of the Dao. Boundless and drifting as if without destination, shifting and moving without abiding—this is the efficacious function of the Dao.

All others have their uses; I alone seem stubborn and coarse. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled. Lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. People all know the use of what is useful, yet none know the use of what is useless. All others have their uses—this is called the use of what is useful. I alone seem stubborn and coarse—this is called the use of what is useless.

The *Commentary* says: "The heart that does not follow the warp of virtue and right is called stubborn." In ancient times, the refined was called beautiful; the rustic was called coarse. Stubbornness means not adorning wisdom; coarseness means not displaying beauty. The spirit-person, by this, remains unhewn.

I alone differ from others, valuing only to seek sustenance from the Mother. Like an infant longing for a foal or calf, I seek only the Dao. For the Dao gives birth, nurtures, fosters, and rears—all things depend on it, as if it were the Mother. Only in seeking the Dao does one differ from those who lose their nature to custom.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue**

The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao. The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao; what things receive to live is called virtue. The Dao is ever without name—how could it be described? Thus its virtue is called numinous.

Virtue has its directions and forms, and all who attain it share in it—thus the Dao is made manifest. Cultivating nature and returning to virtue, when virtue reaches its utmost, it merges with the beginning. Therefore, it follows only the Dao.

As a thing, the Dao is only vague and indistinct. The Dao’s essence is utterly formless, yet its function is wondrous. There is that by which it becomes a thing, yet nothing is not the Dao. "Vague" means there are images that may be likened. "Indistinct" means there are patterns that may be inferred. Yet what is called "there is" is doubtful as to whether it is "there is not." Thus it is said: "As a thing, the Dao."

Indistinct, oh! Vague, oh! Within it there are images. Vague, oh! Indistinct, oh! Within it there are things. What is seen is called an image; what is formed is called a thing. Within the indistinct and vague, images and things are both present—just as the great void transforms into thunder and wind, just as the great earth changes into water and fire, to accomplish transformation and to enact the spirits. This is called the marvel of the Dao.

Dark, oh! Obscure, oh! Within it there is essence. "Dark" is the utmost of the hidden. "Obscure" is the concealment of the luminous. Within the dark and obscure, at the source of utmost yin, where the celestial one first appears, essence truly arises. Its essence is utterly real, and within it there is sincerity. From ancient times to the present, its name has not departed.

Essence is the utmost of heaven’s virtue, upright and not false—thus it is called utterly real. One and unchanging—thus it is said to have sincerity. Uninterrupted and continuous—thus its name does not depart. By this I know the origin of all things—how do I know the origin of all things is so? By this.

The changes of all things pass like days, ceaseless and unstopping. The utmost reality of essence abides, constant and unceasing. The sage values essence, thus able to observe the changes of all things and know their causes. Without thought, yet serene; without action, yet unmoving. Yet moved, it penetrates all affairs under heaven. Then thought arises as the beginning, and the traces of achievement and enterprise emerge. If not the utmost essence under heaven, who could partake in this?

**Chapter Twenty-Two: To Yield Is to Be Preserved Whole**
To yield is to be preserved whole...

To move with things in their undulations, riding the same waves—thus one preserves one’s form and life without loss. As *Zhuangzi* says: "To bend outwardly is to follow others." To bend is to straighten. Abandoned and unregarded, yet without resentment; impoverished and distressed, yet without lament—thus inwardly straight, never losing one’s alignment. As the *Book of Changes* says: "The inchworm’s bending is to seek extension."

To hollow is to fill—
without hoarding, thus ever abundant.
To wear out is to renew—
if winter’s closure is not secure, spring’s growth will not flourish.

Less brings attainment; more brings confusion.
The essentials of the Way are not burdensome—better the few than the many in what one hears and sees. To mistake the branch for the essence is to remain entangled all one’s life; this is called great delusion.

Thus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under heaven. As a thing, it does not waver, and so its generation of things is unfathomable. Only the utmost essence under heaven can become the utmost spirit under heaven. The sage embraces the One to guard it, never disturbing its essence—thus speech becomes the Way for all under heaven, and action becomes the norm.

Not asserting oneself, thus clear—
unobstructed by one’s own views, nothing remains unilluminated, thus clear.
Not self-righteous, thus manifest—
not partial to one’s own rightness, but following what is right, achievements grow great and names resplendent, and all under heaven submits, thus manifest.
Not boasting, thus meritorious—
as the *Book of Documents* says: "If you do not boast, none under heaven can contend with you for merit."
Not self-aggrandizing, thus enduring—
as the *Book of Documents* says: "If you do not aggrandize yourself, none under heaven can contend with you for ability."

Only by not contending does none under heaven contend with one. While others all seek to be first, one alone remains behind, saying: "I receive the world’s filth." Being thus ever in the place of non-contention, who can contend with one?

Was the saying of old, "To yield is to be preserved whole," empty words? Truly whole, one returns to it.

The sage’s movement is like water in engaging with things, yet never loses wholeness; response is like the marking-cord, following principle without losing straightness. Knowing that hollowness becomes fullness, one avoids the burden of arrogance; knowing that wear becomes renewal, one leaves no trace of ostentation—like nature acting of itself, unaware of its own doing.

To reach the yielding is all—thus whole, one returns to it. This preserves the body, fulfills one’s years, yet remains unaware of their passing. Such is the person of complete virtue—were these empty words?

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Sparse Words Are Natural**
Sparse words are natural.
"Sparse" means standing alone above the myriad things, not opposing them—what *Liezi* calls "doubtful solitude." Abandoning cunning and contrivance, following heaven’s principle without external pursuits—thus words are natural.

Thus whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and earth.

Even heaven and earth cannot endure forever—how much less can mere mortals? Heaven and earth bring forth the myriad things: wind disperses them, entrusting all forms to their own transformation; rain moistens them, leaving all things to flourish of themselves. Thus they neither force growth nor urge completion, and the myriad things thrive naturally between heaven and earth—this is why they endure long. But whirlwinds and sudden rains disrupt the harmony of yin and yang, and when some force compels them, things suffer harm—thus they cannot last.

Therefore, those who align with the Dao become one with the Dao; those who align with virtue become one with virtue; those who align with loss become one with loss. Those who become one with the Dao—the Dao embraces them. Those who become one with virtue—virtue embraces them. Those who become one with loss—loss embraces them. To stand in solitude is to follow nothing, to bear no outward sign, to awaken through one’s nature alone, to merge with the Dao and not share in the world’s affairs—how then could virtue be named, or loss be a burden?

Only those who do not understand the spontaneity of solitary transformation deem the Dao difficult to know, difficult to practice, as if it were as remote as the heavens, forever beyond reach. Thus they exhaust mind and body in pursuit of the Dao, now leaning toward one extreme, now blinded by partial truth—until the arts of the Dao are torn asunder across the world. Those who align with the Dao become one with the Dao; those who align with virtue become one with virtue; those who align with loss become one with loss. Yet if they do not attain their own attainment, then what they attain is but loss in disguise.

Where trust is insufficient, disbelief arises. Trust precludes delusion; delusion distorts truth and falsehood, taking the Dao as true and things as false. Thus trust is insufficient, and disbelief follows. The followers of Hui Shi and Han Fei all traced their origins to the Dao, yet strayed far from it—because their trust was insufficient.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Hobbled Cannot Stand**
The hobbled cannot stand; the overreaching cannot walk. To hobble and yet seek to stand, to overreach and yet seek to walk—this violates the constancy of nature and hopes to suit the body, which is difficult indeed. But if one follows virtue, even those with feet will arrive.

Those who display themselves are not enlightened; those who assert themselves are not distinguished; those who boast of their achievements accomplish nothing; those who exalt themselves do not endure. In the Dao, these are called "leftover food and parasitic conduct." To display oneself is to lack the wisdom to encompass things—thus one is not enlightened. To assert oneself is to lack the benevolence to unite with others—thus one is not distinguished. To claim one’s goodness is to lose that goodness—thus one accomplishes nothing. To exalt one’s ability is to lose that achievement—thus one does not endure. Where the Dao resides, depth is its root, restraint its guiding principle. Extravagance in appearance and indulgence in desire—how could this be the Dao? Thus in sustenance it is excess, in conduct it is parasitic. Things may despise such ways, so those who possess the Dao do not dwell in them. To exceed one’s nature is to overflow—this is what heaven diminishes, earth transforms, and people despise. Thus those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: There Is a Thing Formed in Chaos**
There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Its qi, form, and substance exist yet remain undivided—this is called "primordial unity." In primordial unity, its completion is unbroken, what the *Yijing* calls the "Supreme Ultimate." Heaven and earth depend on it to come into being, thus it is said to be born before heaven and earth. Yet since it has birth, it is not the mystery of the unborn—thus it is called a "thing."

Silent and vast,
Silent and vast, it does not engage in movement nor interact with things—it simply abides in profound stillness. Standing alone and unchanging,
Held in great constancy, it does not transform with things—this describes the essence of the Dao. Circling endlessly without exhaustion,
Its utility enters and exits, coming and going without end—this describes the function of the Dao. It may be called the mother of all under heaven.
The myriad things rely on it to live.

Whose name I know not, I style it the Dao, and by force name it the Great.
Things arise and then have form; form and then have growth; growth and then have number.
Names arise from reality, and reality has its numbers—what is styled is but growth.
The Dao is ever nameless, thus what is styled "great" is but a term opposing the small, and so may be named.
The mystery of the Dao is subtle and hidden; the center of the Dao is vast and manifest.
Great means "passing away,"
For it moves without lingering, thus called "passing away."
"Passing away" means "far-reaching,"
For it responds without exhaustion, thus called "far-reaching."
"Far-reaching" means "returning."
To return to the root is stillness; stillness is to recover destiny—thus called "returning."
The central essence of the Dao, when named as great, pervades, covers, and contains all without distinction—this is what is meant by "far-reaching yet unobstructed."
When the moving is still, the acting ceases, then the Dao returns and does not depart from nature—what the *Yijing* calls "near yet still and correct."
Thus the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great.
The Dao covers and bears Heaven and Earth; Heaven covers all without fail, Earth bears all without fail. The king stands at the center of Heaven and Earth, and with them forms a triad—thus he too is great.
Within the realm there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them.
Descending from the Dao, there are directions and forms—thus it is called "within the realm."
Still, he is sagely; moving, he is kingly. Able to penetrate the Three Powers and unite them in the human Dao, he becomes king.
Thus he shares the same essence as the Dao, the same work as Heaven and Earth, and is likewise called great.
Man models himself on Earth, Earth models itself on Heaven, Heaven models itself on the Dao, the Dao models itself on spontaneity.
"Man" here refers to the king. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; the emperor and king act not, yet the world achieves success—what they model themselves on is but the spontaneity of the Dao.
The Dao models itself on spontaneity, for it responds to things.
Spontaneity is not the whole of the Dao; when it emerges to respond to things, it descends and models itself below.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
Weight is the root of lightness; stillness is the lord of restlessness.
Thus the noble person travels all day yet does not leave the baggage train.
Weighted, one is not swayed or seized and has something to hold to—thus it is the root of lightness. Still, one does not move recklessly and has something to restrain—thus it is the lord of restlessness.
Holding to stillness and weight, one rarely loses them. The noble person travels all day without leaving the baggage train—thus he treads the perilous path without harm.
Though there be splendid sights, he dwells in them with transcendent ease.
Splendor lies in things; ease lies in oneself. Only when the self is at peace can things be enjoyed.
How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat himself lightly before the world?
The world is a great thing. He who possesses a great thing is as if driving six horses with a rotten rope—thus he cannot treat himself lightly before the world.
Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the lord.
Not weighty, one lacks awe—thus loses ministers. Without leading, there is no harmony, and one oversteps bounds—thus loses the lord.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
Good traveling leaves no tracks,
For what abides is spirit, what passes is transformation—thus no tracks remain.
Good speech leaves no flaws,
Harmonizing with heaven’s boundary, flowing with manifold change—thus no flaws remain.
The greatness of words and deeds begins with deliberation and ends in transformation.
Only the sage can perfect words and deeds and achieve the mystery of transformation.
Thus deeds leave no trace of progress to follow, words leave no flaws to burden.
Good reckoning uses no counting rods,
Grasping the One, all affairs are complete—how much more those beyond number?
Thus no counting rods are used, and the ten thousand variations are as if counted one by one.
Good closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened,
Sealing the spirit, withdrawing and storing in secrecy.
Good knotting needs no cords yet cannot be undone.
What is made firm by cords cuts into its nature.
Or, without speaking, one drinks others with harmony; standing beside others, one transforms them—then, without cords, it is firm—who can undo it?
Thus the sage is ever good at saving people, and so there are no outcast people.
Ever good at saving things, and so there are no discarded things.
Goodness is the continuation of the Dao. When obscured in the Dao, there is no goodness to be named.
When the name of goodness is established, the Dao emerges and benefits the world.
The sage embodies the Dao to aid the world—thus he has these five kinds of goodness and reaches the point where people and things are not discarded.
Yet the sage’s love for people and benefit to things, by which things fulfill their lives and people delight in their natures, are not by design.
Returning to the One without striving, following their constant nature—this alone.
The world has lost the Dao; all under heaven have lost their tranquil, still, and constant nature, daily sinking into the realm of care and exhaustion—who but the sage can save them?
This is called "following illumination."
"Following" means not displaying it outwardly; following illumination, the light shines yet does not dazzle.
Thus the good person is the teacher of the not-good.
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
"Resource" speaks of its benefit. Only when there is the not-good does one know the benefit of the good.
Not valuing their teacher, not loving their resource—
When all under heaven know the good as good, this is already not-good.
Good and not-good, self and other—both forgotten, with no mind to contain them—then what valuing or loving could there be?
This is how the sage greatly unites with things.
Though wisdom be great, is it not delusion?
This is called the essential mystery.
The essential mystery of the Dao does not display manifold goodness, has no use for wisdom. The seven sages are all deluded, with no path to inquire—this meaning accords with it.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Know the male, keep to the female, and be the ravine of the world.
As the ravine of the world, constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of the infant.
The male overcomes things with strength; the female is merely soft and still.
The sage’s wisdom knows how to overcome things, yet he places himself in softness and stillness. The myriad things all come to him, drawing from him without exhaustion—thus he is the ravine of the world.

The ravine lies low, and flowing waters gather to it. Thus, by not relying on strength but holding to humility, virtue and nature remain constantly united and undivided—this is called wholeness of virtue. Therefore it is said: *constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of the infant.* Qi harmonious and not violent, nature pure and not yet dispersed—this is the infant. Mencius said: *The great man does not lose the heart of his infancy.*

Know the white, keep to the black, and be the model for the world. As the model for the world, constant virtue is not forceful, returning to the boundless. The white illustrates the manifestation of virtue; the black illustrates the return to the Dao. The sage makes his virtue luminous yet silently unites with the Dao, without a single flaw—thus the world takes him as its standard. He is willingly emulated and never resented, therefore he is the model for the world. Upright and not false, trustworthy as the four seasons, without the slightest deviation—such a one is difficult to exhaust, never reaching an end. Therefore it is said: *constant virtue is not forceful, returning to the boundless.*

The *Book of Documents*, in the *Great Plan*, speaks of royal governance, saying *return to the mean*; Laozi speaks of being the model for the world, saying *return to the boundless.* The *mean* is the center. *Having a mean* refers to virtue manifest in affairs, taking the center as its ultimate. *Boundless* refers to virtue returning to the Dao, which cannot be attained.

Know glory, keep to disgrace, and be the valley of the world. As the valley of the world, constant virtue is thus fulfilled, returning to simplicity. Beyond nature and destiny, there is nothing that is not a thing. The people of the world regard gain as glory, loss as disgrace, prosperity as glory, and hardship as disgrace. Only the sage can regard glory and disgrace as one, without a mind of preference or rejection. Yet he does not aspire to extravagance but takes frugality as his principle—this is emptiness alone, therefore he is the valley of the world. The valley is empty yet able to receive, responsive yet not hoarding. When virtue reaches this point, it is perfect and complete, beyond any addition. Therefore it is said: *constant virtue is thus fulfilled.*

Simplicity is the whole body of the Dao. Returning to simplicity, one can fully embody the Dao. The orphaned, the widowed, and the barren—kings and dukes take these as their titles, thus embracing simplicity and the world submits. When simplicity disperses, it becomes vessels. That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called vessels. There are forms and names, divisions and responsibilities—the Dao is whole, heaven and humanity unite as one. Vessels are dispersed, heaven and humanity separate into two. When the sage employs them, he becomes an official leader. The wholeness of the Dao, the sage uses to govern himself. The dispersion of the Dao, the sage uses to govern the world. With forms that can be named and divisions that can be maintained, offices and ranks are established, and the world is ordered. This is called *official leader.* The *Book of Changes* says: *Know the subtle, know the manifest; know the soft, know the hard—this is the hope of ten thousand men.* This meaning is the same.

Therefore, *great regulation does not carve.*

Transforming and shaping it, preservation lies in change. Carving and sculpting myriad forms is not considered skill.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
Those who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a great vessel. That which possesses a great vessel cannot be treated as a vessel. To treat it as a vessel yet not be treated as one—thus one can master all vessels. Understanding that the master of vessels is not a vessel, and having no intention of acting upon the world—such a one may be entrusted with the world.

Those who would take the world and act upon it rely on wisdom and depend on force—how far they miss the mark! Therefore the sage follows the Dao’s transformation and does not exalt wisdom or force. The Qin’s loss through strength—perhaps this is what it refers to!

The world is a sacred vessel. Shaped by form and number, bounded by square and body, confined between heaven and earth—it is a vessel. Standing in the unfathomable, moving without direction—those who act upon it fail, those who grasp it lose. Therefore it is called a *sacred vessel*—it cannot be acted upon. To govern the myriad things and command the movements of the multitude, there must be one who is not a vessel—only then is the world at peace. Therefore it is said: *The highest must practice non-action and employ the world.*

Those who act fail. Those capable of action yet incapable of non-action—wisdom becomes ensnared. Zhuangzi said: *Excessive knowledge leads to failure.* Those who grasp lose it. The value of the Dao lies in timing. Grasping without adaptation loses the movement of the times—this is called *deviating from the Dao.*

Thus things may advance or follow, exhale or inhale, be strong or weak, be borne or overthrown. The principles of the myriad things: some advance, some follow—like the sun and moon’s coming and going. Some exhale, some inhale—like the four seasons’ succession. Some are strong, some weak—like the five phases’ waxing and waning. Some are borne, some overthrown—like the grasses and trees’ blooming and falling. Bound by time and constrained by number, they are inevitably burdened. Only the sage is not burdened by things but stands alone above the myriad things. Moving alone, coming alone—this is called *unique possession.* The person of unique possession—this is called *supreme nobility.* Thus, wielding the sacred vessel with ease, the forms of things vary, yet my heart remains constant.

Therefore the sage eliminates extremes, eliminates extravagance, eliminates excess. The sage observes the changes of the myriad things, knowing that fullness and pretense bring many burdens. Thus he does not indulge life, does not lavish nature, does not reach excess, but roams within the bounds of the contract. In this way, how could there be the failure of those who act or the loss of those who grasp? Therefore it is said: *Excessive ornamentation and adornment are of no benefit to governance.*

**Chapter Thirty**
Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do not use arms to strengthen the world. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the least of virtues. The least is what the ancients possessed but did not prioritize. Those who assist a ruler with the Dao focus on the root alone, therefore they do not use arms to strengthen the world. Their actions readily return. As Mencius said: *It will return to you.*

Where armies encamp, thorns and brambles grow. After great military campaigns, there are inevitably years of famine.

Where the lower seizes the people’s strength, thorns and brambles grow. Where the higher violates the seasons of Heaven, there are inevitably years of famine. The *Odes* says: *"Pacify the ten thousand states, and there will be repeated years of abundance."* When the ten thousand states are pacified, the people are in harmony; when the people are in harmony, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds. Thus, the good attain their ends and nothing more, daring not to seize strength by force.

To seek what is feasible, to achieve what is complete, to expend little effort yet see great results—this is the Way of the sage. To overcome others by force is called a baleful power. Thus, military victory lies in harmony, not in numbers.

Be resolute yet not boastful, resolute yet not vaunting, resolute yet not arrogant, resolute only when there is no alternative, resolute yet not forceful. Among those who act only when there is no alternative, this is the Way of the sage. Thus, an army that strikes from the center achieves good fortune; one that acts with rectitude incurs no blame. Only when there is no alternative does one respond, seeking only to achieve success.

Boasting brings no growth; vaunting yields no merit; arrogance offers nothing worth beholding. Embodying these four is how one achieves without forcing.

When things reach their prime, they age—the transformations of summer’s growth and autumn’s harvest are evident. This is called "not the Dao." The Dao has no beginning or end and does not transform with things. What is not the Dao perishes early.

Those who delight in arms dwell outside the Dao, and so encounter the alternation of strength and age.

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Now, arms are instruments of ill omen; some beings detest them, and thus those who possess the Dao do not abide by them. Auspicious affairs are attended by good fortune, but arms are instruments of misfortune—hence they are called inauspicious. When arms are sheathed, they move only in due season. Those who possess the Dao display their virtue and do not parade their arms, thus they do not abide by them.

Therefore, the noble person values the left in times of peace and the right in times of war. Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the noble person. The left pertains to yang and governs life; the right pertains to yin and oversees killing. Yang embodies virtue; yin embodies punishment. The noble person honors virtue and fears punishment—hence arms are not the instruments of the noble person. They are used only when there is no alternative.

Serenity is supreme, and thus they are not glorified.

Should arms be glorified, one takes delight in them. To delight in them is to delight in the killing of men. To suppress violence and rescue from chaos, one acts only under compulsion—hence it is done out of necessity. Without intent to conquer, serenity is supreme. Without intent to conquer, arms are not an object of delight—thus they are not glorified. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions under Heaven.

When the ruler of a state cherishes benevolence, none in the world can oppose him. To secure what is perilous and profit from what leads to ruin, to take pleasure in that which brings destruction—this is where resentment gathers and misfortune converges.

Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs honor the right. Thus, the deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right—signifying that when one holds a position of power, it is treated as a funeral rite. When many are slain, one mourns with sorrow and weeping. Even in victory, it is treated as a funeral rite.

The *Book of Changes* regards warfare as a poison upon the world. Though one may triumph in battle, there are still those who suffer its venom. Therefore, those who hold power and those who achieve victory are treated with the rites of mourning.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
The Dao is eternally nameless.

The Dao is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—how could it be named? Though the Uncarved Block is small, none under Heaven can subdue it. The Uncarved Block illustrates the wholeness of the Dao. When forms and names arise, the great governs the small, yet the wholeness of the Dao does not depart from nature. Even in discerning the smallest things, what Zhuangzi called the "True Ruler" remains present.

Should lords and kings hold fast to it, the myriad things will naturally submit. When the Dao suffices as the master of things, they will submit of themselves. Zhuangzi said: "In simplicity and plainness, the people’s nature is preserved. They submit to the myriad things without coercion or punishment—this is near to it."

When Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends. No one commands it, yet it spreads evenly. In preserving the pure and unadorned Dao without loss, not only will things submit of themselves, but above it reaches Heaven, below it coils through Earth. Flowing in harmony with Heaven and Earth, it establishes communion and balance, and the myriad things all receive its blessing. Sweet dew is the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. The *Commentary* says: "When the virtue of emperors and kings extends upward to the Great Purity, downward to the Great Peace, and pervades the myriad spirits, sweet dew descends."

When the first regulations and names arise, names too come into being. One must then know when to stop—knowing when to stop is how one avoids peril. In the order of the Great Dao, after five transformations, forms and names may be established. Once there are forms to be named, the Dao declines and virtue wanes, purity dissolves and simplicity scatters, with no one to halt it. Those who transform the world gaze in distress at the world’s afflictions, while the unbenevolent pursue the desires of their nature and life, glutting themselves on wealth and honor. The sage is not thus. When the first regulations and names arise, he does not follow things in their changes but remains serene and self-sufficient—who could endanger him? Thus it is said: knowing when to stop avoids peril.

The Dao’s presence in the world is like streams and valleys flowing into rivers and seas. The world is one nature. The Dao in the world unites through nature, just as streams and valleys join rivers and seas through the gathering of water. Those of the same kind attain it; those of like kind respond. What does the sage’s governance require? Simply following nature.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
He who knows others is wise...

The *Commentary* states: "Wisdom is like the eye—it can see a hundred paces away yet cannot see its own lashes." Discerning others’ crookedness or uprightness, distinguishing white from black, is the work of wisdom in knowing others. Yet "he who knows himself is enlightened." The *Book of Changes* says: "Returning to know oneself," and the *Commentary* states: "Inward vision is called enlightenment." Wisdom that knows others engages with the external, daily stirring the heart; returning to know oneself is stillness that reverts to the root, seeing oneself alone—this is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the illumination of the ten thousand things.

"He who conquers others is forceful; he who conquers himself is strong." The perfected person values virtue over force, strives to conquer himself rather than others. The wise feign foolishness, the brave appear timid—this is conquering others, relying on force. Overcoming one’s private desires, nurturing uprightness without harm—this is conquering oneself. Outwardly, one stands alone without fear; inwardly, one follows the world without vexation. Going nowhere without victory—this is strength.

"He who knows contentment is rich." Wealth lies in myriad differences; the content know inner wandering and find sufficiency within. All things are complete, and the state’s wealth is included. "He who acts with perseverance has resolve." Unceasing self-strengthening—this is resolve in the Dao. "He who does not lose his place endures." Standing firm without changing direction, one endures in the Dao. Those who shift with time and follow things may last but a moment. "He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived." Life has its sprouting, death its return; tracing origins and reverting to the end, one knows the discourse of life and death. The sage comprehends the Dao of day and night, knowing death is no different from life. Thus, when his form dissolves, his spirit does not perish—it merges with Heaven and Earth, its limit unknown. What is this if not longevity?

This chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principle, centers on knowing contentment to fulfill nature, and concludes with non-perishing to reach destiny—thus, creation lies within me. Who but one who transcends past and present, entering non-death and non-birth, can achieve this?

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
The great Dao flows—it may go left or right. Floating without attachment, it moves and rests without fail, comes and goes without end. Left or right, nothing is beyond it. The ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse; its work complete, it does not dwell. It aids those who depart, grants those who seek. The ten thousand things take form, transform, gain wisdom, and exert strength on their own—it claims no merit, like the four seasons, which depart once their work is done. Clothing and covering the ten thousand things without ruling them, it is ever desireless—this may be called small. The ten thousand things return to it without knowing their master—this may be called great. The Dao, in its utmost subtlety, is small and distinguishes itself from things; in its utmost transformation, it is great and mingles with them. Distinguishing itself, it remains ever open and desireless; mingling with things, the ten thousand things return to it. It blankets the ten thousand things without displaying its governing power, thus it does not rule. It animates the multitude without revealing its direction—thus, none know its mastery. The Dao cannot be named as small or great; what can be named is merely its reach toward things. Therefore, the sage never acts as great, and thus accomplishes greatness. His merit covers the world yet seems not his own—thus his enterprise is vast and his wealth boundless. Mencius said: "Greatness that transforms is called sageliness." One who is great yet can transform—how could he be burdened by acting great? This is how he accomplishes greatness.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
Hold to the great image, and all under Heaven will come. The image is like Heaven’s hanging constellations—non-action, moving with vigor, wordless, displaying its pattern. The sage governs the world through non-action, teaching without words, and the people turn to him as to parents. Thus it is said: "Hold to the great image, and all under Heaven will come." Coming without harm—yin and yang harmonize in stillness, ghosts and spirits do not disturb, the multitude of beings are unharmed, the ten thousand things do not die young. Though the people have knowledge, they have no use for it—what harm could there be? Peace, levelness, and greatness. Peace means no fear of danger or ruin; levelness means no peril of steep slopes; greatness means openness and order.

Music and bait make passing guests stop. Those delighted by sound and taste are the world’s people, ensnared by things and unable to free themselves—things bind them, so they stop. The Dao’s words emerge insipid, without flavor. Look and it cannot be seen; listen and it cannot be heard; use it and it cannot be exhausted. What can be tasted has been tasted, yet the tasting of taste has never appeared—thus it is insipid, without flavor. What can be seen has been seen, yet the seeing of seeing has never manifested—thus it cannot be seen. What can be heard has been heard, yet the hearing of hearing has never sounded—thus it cannot be heard. Such is it that it can be bitter or sweet, dark or yellow, gong or shang. Without knowledge, it knows all; without ability, it can do all—thus its use cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**
To gather, first surely expand; to weaken, first surely strengthen; to abolish, first surely exalt; to take, first surely give. Yin and yang illuminate each other, alternately covering and governing; the four seasons replace one another, alternately generating and destroying. The principle of the ten thousand things, the transmission of human relations—their contraction and dispersal, their flourishing and decline, their sudden rise and waning fullness—all emerge from the subtlest beginnings, their signs unseen. Only the sage who studies subtleties perceives their auspiciousness beforehand; the worthy may approach this. Yang flourishes in summer, yet yin is born at noon; yin congeals in winter, yet yang is born at midnight.

King Goujian sought to exhaust Wu, yet urged it to attack Qi; Duke Zhi of Jin plotted to raid Chouyou, yet presented it with grand chariots. This is how the sage treads on frost and knows the coming of solid ice—observing the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, not fixating on their forms. Thus the brave cannot be weakened, nor the wise deprived. This is called "subtle illumination." What is yet unmanifest is subtle, yet its principle is most evident. Yang Xiong said: "When water stills in the deep, when branches wither on the tree, the wise perceive it while the multitude remains unaware."

The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. To amass countless small victories into one great triumph—only the sage can achieve this. The *Classic* states: "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong."

In the *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters, the dialogue on Kui, the serpent, and the wind declares: "Point to me, and I surpass you; imitate me, and I surpass you. Yet only I can snap great trees and topple lofty halls." Fish must not leave the depths; a state’s sharp instruments must not be displayed. The depths are where fish conceal themselves; sharp instruments are how a state controls others. A fish that swallows boats, once stranded on dry land, may be tormented by ants—thus it must not leave the depths.

When a ruler bestows rewards, ministers exploit his favor; when he imposes punishments, they seize his authority. Rewards and punishments are tools of governance—yet even these must not be displayed, let alone the Way of governance. The sage wields sharp instruments without revealing them, not relying on force, for there lies a wondrous Dao. He may dominate all within the seas without a reputation for cunning, subdue the myriad things without a record of valor, never boasting of conquest yet attaining the constant Way of victory.

Yang opens and yin suddenly closes—endless transformation. He drives his ministers, steers the world, yet none can fathom him. Thus he controls others without being controlled. The root lies above; the essence rests with the ruler—then the world is well-ordered.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone. Still and unmoving, it responds and thereby penetrates all causes under heaven. Should lords and kings abide by it, the ten thousand things will transform of themselves.

When still water meets form, it does not deploy cleverness, yet the square, round, crooked, and straight cannot escape it. Should lords and kings uphold the Dao to govern the age, they enter the realm of non-action, and their governance emerges from non-action. They bestow transformation upon the ten thousand things, and the ten thousand things are transformed by it—like nature acting of itself, unaware of who acts. Thus it is called "self-transformation."

Should transformation stir desire, I will quell it with the nameless uncarved block. *Mencius* said: "Those who wait for King Wen before rising are common folk." The people merely follow their superiors’ transformation. When desire stirs, they depart from the Dao to pursue goodness, tread perilous virtue to act, abandoning nature to follow the heart. This is insufficient to settle the world. Only the Dao is nameless, the uncarved block yet undispersed—thus it quells those who act.

Nothing surpasses loyalty in rescuing the urgent; this is the reason. The nameless uncarved block will also have no desire. Ji Zhen’s doctrine of "non-action" grasps but one facet of things. Among the arts of the Dao in antiquity, some resided in this. Yet few could embody the fullness of heaven and earth—thus it, too, will have no desire. This is why Master Lao untangled confusion and dissolved obstructions.

Without desire, through stillness, the world will right itself. When water is still, it levels to the plumb line—great craftsmen take it as their model. Without desire, through stillness, one does not lose correctness. First rectify yourself, and the world will right itself.

The *Book of Changes* states: "The Qian Dao transforms and changes, each rectifying its nature and destiny." The Qian Dao transforms and changes—this is non-action. Each rectifies its nature and destiny—this is without desire, through stillness, and the world will right itself.

To govern the world with the Dao, reaching the point where each rectifies its nature and destiny—this is called the ultimate governance.

*Emperor Huizong of Song’s Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Two, Concluded*
*Emperor Huizong of Song’s Imperial Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Three*

**Scroll on Virtue, Part One**

The Dao has no fixed form or substance, while virtue may be complete or deficient. When united with the Dao, there is no virtue to be named; when separated from virtue, there are names by which to distinguish it. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are received according to capacity and applied according to the times—this is merely virtue.

Those who embody the Dao differ from this, and thus are placed in the latter scroll.

**Chapter 38: The Highest Virtue Does Not Claim Virtue**

The highest virtue does not claim virtue, and thus possesses virtue.
That by which things attain life is called virtue. When all alike attain it, silently harmonizing with the Dao, erring without regret, acting rightly without self-satisfaction—this is called *not claiming virtue*. Confucius did not rest in his sageliness but responded to the times with sageliness, and thus possessed virtue.

Lower virtue does not lose virtue, and thus has no virtue.
Clinging to it as one’s own, acting selfishly to lose the Dao—what virtue is there in this?

The highest virtue acts without contrivance, and thus has no deliberate action.
Attaining without thought, hitting the mark without effort, arriving without movement—this is the highest virtue.

Lower virtue acts with contrivance, and thus has deliberate action.
Without thought, one does not attain; without effort, one does not hit the mark; without movement, one does not arrive—this is lower virtue.

Virtue has high and low—is this not how the sage and the worthy are distinguished?

Transcending form and abandoning knowledge, penetrating the Great Unity, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are so fundamental that they cannot be simplified, and thus there is no deliberate action. Bending and yielding with rites and music, invoking benevolence and righteousness to console the hearts of the world, securing what others secure without securing it for oneself—thus there is deliberate action.

The highest benevolence acts without contrivance.
Yao and Shun embodied benevolence by covering the world without seeking profit—thus they acted without contrivance.

The highest righteousness acts with contrivance.
Measuring what is fitting in dealing with enemies is called righteousness; establishing oneself and regulating affairs—how can one be without contrivance?

The highest propriety acts, yet none respond, so one rolls up one’s sleeves and forces compliance.
Propriety is for interacting with others, demonstrating to them the patterns of benevolence and righteousness—its uses are many. Yet if one first gives without expecting reciprocity, and exhausts all giving without response, then resentment and strife arise, and disorder follows. In the Spring and Autumn period, a single unkind word or an improper bow could lead two states to shed blood—rolling up one’s sleeves and forcing compliance is but a minor instance of this. The sage values benevolence and devalues righteousness, and propriety is not where he dwells. Thus, the highest benevolence is akin to virtue, the highest righteousness involves contrivance, and the highest propriety meets with no response.

Therefore, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, propriety follows. Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.

The Dao cannot be fully attained, so when the Dao is lost, virtue follows. Virtue cannot be fully realized, so when virtue is lost, benevolence follows. Benevolence can be practiced, and thus it approaches righteousness—so when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows. Righteousness can be compromised, and when compromised, it is adorned with propriety—so when righteousness is lost, propriety follows. By the time propriety is reached, one is ever farther from the Dao, and what is lost grows ever more numerous.

All things do not flourish simultaneously—this is the principle of mutual restriction and concession, as with power and virtue. Where substance is abundant, appearance is modest, as in the rites between father and son. From this, we see that where rites proliferate, substance must be waning; when substance wanes, pretense follows, and strife and chaos arise. Thus, propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust, and the beginning of chaos.

Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.
When the Dao descends and emerges, it gives rise to knowledge. Using knowledge as a chisel, one carves and sharpens it, exhausting the spirit and recklessly speculating—this is called foreknowledge. Foreknowledge pursues the branches and forgets the root, and thus is the flower of the Dao. The mind labors, and knowledge grows ever more entangled—thus it is the beginning of folly. Even if one’s guesses often hit the mark, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.

Therefore, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness; abides in substance, not ornament. What is *there* is what the Dao abandons; what is *here* is what the Dao esteems. What the Dao esteems is thick and not thin, substantial and without ornament. Who, unless possessed of wisdom sufficient to know oneself, returning to the original nature and not drifting into the habits of external things, can achieve this?

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Dun fu* (sincere return) brings no regret, for one examines oneself within."* *Dun* is the utmost thickness. That which is thick in human life is one’s nature. Returning to one’s nature is simply dwelling in thickness—this is how the great man embodies the Dao and perfects virtue.

**Chapter 39: Those of Old Who Attained the One**

Those of old who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
Spirits attained the One and became numinous;
Valleys attained the One and became full;
The myriad things attained the One and came to life;
Lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world.

Their attainment—
*Zhuangzi* said: *"When one is through with the One, all affairs are complete."* Attaining the One means no duality; embracing the One means no separation; guarding the One means no change. To know the One is to know all things; not to know the One is to know nothing.

Those of old who attained the One embodied the world’s purest essence, and nothing could match them. Thus, what is firm and lofty above is pure and unadulterated; what is settled and stable below is still and unchanging. What is most obscure and formless is the spirit—attaining the One, it is not obscured. What is most empty and responsive is the valley—attaining the One, it is not exhausted. The myriad things transform through essence into form, and thus attain the One to come to life. Lords and kings alone govern the multitude, and thus attain the One to become the standard for the world.

From heaven and earth to lords and kings, though their positions differ—high and low, obscure and manifest—heaven’s clarity, earth’s tranquility, and the lords’ and kings’ role as the world’s standard arise from no external seeking. The One alone brings this about. Thus, it is said: *"Their governance is unified."*

Heaven, without its clarity, would fear cracking; earth, without its tranquility, would fear erupting; spirit, without its numinosity, would fear fading; the valley, without its fullness, would fear exhaustion; the myriad things, without their life, would fear annihilation; lords and kings, without their rectitude and exalted position, would fear collapse.

Heaven’s office is to cover and give life; earth’s office is to shape and bear. If heaven cracks, it can no longer cover; if earth erupts, it can no longer bear. Spirit moves through man—if it fades, it can no longer manifest. The valley receives but does not store—if it is exhausted, nothing responds to it. When essence and qi gather, they form things, for they attain the One and thus live. When they scatter, the wandering soul transforms, for they lose the One and thus perish.

Only rectitude enables one to govern the myriad changes and stand alone above the ten thousand things. Without rectitude while exalting one’s high position, one will be unable to preserve oneself—how can one avoid collapse? Thus, the noble takes the lowly as its root, the high takes the low as its foundation. The lowly is what the noble relies upon for stability; the low is where the high arises. The world sees only the branches, but the sage probes the root; the world sees only the outcome, but the sage perceives the subtle. Thus, they constantly attain the One.

Therefore, lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—is this not taking the lowly as their root? These are the most humble of names, yet lords and kings use them as their titles, for they know their source. Is this not why lords and kings remain exalted and unshaken?

Thus, seeking excessive praise brings no true praise. Those who exalt themselves to surpass others, who value themselves to belittle others, who rely on strength without knowing to guard with softness, who cling to whiteness without knowing to guard with blackness—seeking praise from the world and thus accumulating excessive praise—will find that undeserved praise gathers like a storm, while baseless slander follows close behind. This is why there is no true praise.

One does not desire to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone. Jade is prized and stone is base, each fixed and unchanging. The sage rides the moment and responds to things without attachment, for though the ten thousand changes are ceaseless, the sage’s heart remains constant in the One. This is true attainment of the One, and thus one cannot be deemed noble or base.

Mencius said: "What is detestable about clinging to the One is that it clings to the One while abandoning the hundred." Not desiring to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone—none but the sage who understands transformation can attain this. This is called "supreme virtue."

**Chapter 40: Reversion is the movement of the Dao**

Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao. The things of the world are born from being, and being is born from non-being. The principles of the world—movement and stillness, strength and weakness—mutually give rise to one another. The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root, then proceeding and reverting to utmost stillness. Yet when stimulated, they penetrate all causes under heaven, and movement becomes nothing other than oneself. Thus it is said: *Reversion is the movement of the Dao.*

Softness overcomes hardness; weakness overcomes strength—this is the marvelous function of the Dao. *Zhuangzi* said: "Accumulating many small victories to achieve a great victory—only the sage can do this." Thus it is said: *Weakness is the function of the Dao.*

The progression of the four seasons withdraws and stores in winter, then burgeons and flourishes in spring. Water’s nature is utmost softness, yet in attacking the hard and strong, none can surpass it—does this not illustrate the point? Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another like a cycle: non-being moves and generates being, being reaches its limit and returns to non-being, like east and west opposing yet unable to exist without each other.

Those deluded by inaction or drowned in compulsion—can this be the Dao?

**Chapter 41: The Superior Man Hears of the Dao**

When the superior man hears of the Dao, he diligently practices it. The scholar is one who is devoted to the Dao; the superior man, upon hearing the Dao, accumulates sincerity and effort over time without ceasing.

When the middling man hears of the Dao, he is present yet absent. The middling man harbors doubt, and doubt divides his will. Regarding the Dao, he goes out and comes in.

When the inferior man hears of the Dao, he laughs greatly at it. If he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao. The inferior man lacks sufficient faith and wisdom to guard or understand it, so he laughs.

The Dao has no form, color, sound, or flavor to grasp—how far removed it is from what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth desire! *Zhuangzi* said: "Great sounds do not enter the ears of the vulgar; lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the multitude." Thus, the ancients said:

*Manifesting the Dao seems obscure*—
Like the light of the sun and moon illuminating the earth below—this is brightness. Yet the sage conceals his original wisdom and does not display it, veiling his light without dazzling, thus seeming obscure.

*The level Dao seems uneven*—
Though paths differ, they converge in one; though thoughts vary, they unite in purpose.

*Advancing the Dao seems like retreat*—
Yan Hui took retreat as advancement; *Zhuangzi* spoke of "sitting in forgetfulness."

*Supreme virtue seems like a valley*—
Empty yet responsive, responding without exhaustion; empty yet receptive, receiving without storing. The *Classic* says: "Be the valley of the world, and constant virtue will be sufficient."

*Great whiteness seems tarnished*—
Washing away and contemplating the profound, one sees no flaw—this is great whiteness. Yet dwelling where the multitude shuns, it seems tarnished.

*Vast virtue seems insufficient*—
Virtue embraces all yet does not consider itself full—thus it seems insufficient. When the autumn waters arrive, the River Lord rejoices, only to be ridiculed by those of great understanding.

*Established virtue seems negligent*—
The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet always succeeds.

*True substance seems to change*—
Does it not say: "Is it not firm?"

"Polished yet unthinned—
Is it not called white?
Dyed yet unstained—

The great square has no corners,
For the great square is the square without squareness.
Square yet not cutting, thus it has no corners.

The great vessel is late in completion,
For the great vessel is the vessel without vesselness.
Not hastening growth, not forcing increase, thus late in completion.

The great tone is soundless,
Moving without fixed direction, yet evoking response—thus soundless.

The great image has no form,
Abiding in profound obscurity, unseen even when gazed upon—thus formless.

The Dao is hidden, without name,
Yet only the Dao excels in bestowing and accomplishing.

From the luminous Dao to the great image,
All are the Dao.
The Dao’s subtlety cannot be sought through wisdom,
Nor grasped through form—truly hidden.
Though one may wish to illuminate it, it cannot be attained.
The sage attains the Dao,
Thus bestows without depletion, responds without exhaustion,
Completes the myriad things in their curvature,
Never claiming possession—merely acting and then letting be.

The Dao’s essence, hidden in namelessness,
Yet in function excels in bestowing and accomplishing.
Diligently practicing it,
One reaches the formless
And rests where nothing is transformed.

Its remaining efficacy suffices for the works of emperors and kings.
The *Tradition* says:
'Learning begins with becoming a scholar,
And ends with becoming a sage.'"

Dao Gives Birth—Chapter Forty-Two
"The Dao gives birth to the One,"

In the Great Beginning, there was Non-Being—Non-Being without name. From this arose the One. The One gives birth to the Two: Heaven is One, Earth is Two. Water is born first, then fire follows; essence is complete, and spirit attends it. The Two gives birth to the Three: One with speech becomes Two, Two with One becomes Three. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Heaven initiates the One in the North, Earth pairs the One in the South, and humanity establishes its position as the Third. The Three Powers are complete, and the ten thousand images divide. Numbering the count of things, we call them the myriad. Beyond this, even the most skilled reckoner cannot calculate. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonized by the qi of the Mean.

Yin halts and is still—all things bear it. Thus the noble person enters rest at sunset. Yang fuses and flourishes—all things embrace it. Thus the sage faces the light to govern. There must be the Mean between yin and yang, which is the harmonizing qi. Zhuangzi says: "Supreme yang blazes brightly; supreme yin is solemnly still. Solemn stillness emerges from Heaven; blazing brightness issues from Earth. The two intermingle and form harmony, and things are born therefrom."

What people despise are the terms "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy," yet kings and dukes use them as their titles. Things do not flourish without decline, nor do affairs prosper without waning—this is the movement of yin and yang, the principle of all things. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, proceed in accord with it, yet never lose their harmony. Is this not the mark of the sage? To take "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy" as one’s titles—what people despise—kings and dukes use as their designations. Having reached the extreme, one returns; having become full, one diminishes. Thus one abides in supremacy without peril. Therefore, some things are diminished yet gain, while others are increased yet lose. When leaves fall, they fertilize the roots—this is diminishing that brings gain. When the moon waxes full, it must wane—this is increasing that brings loss. Heaven and Earth wax and wane with the seasons—how much more so for humanity? Thus what kings and dukes designate is the very way to govern with benefit and dwell in lofty eminence.

What people teach, I also teach: "The strong and overbearing do not meet their proper end." I will take this as the father of my teaching. To overpower the weak with strength, to overcome the soft with hardness—this is what people teach. What I teach differs from this. The strong and overbearing possess a self and delight in contention; they follow the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning. Thus I take it as the father of my teaching.

**The Softest in the World—Chapter Forty-Three**
The softest in the world gallops through the hardest. What is hard will break; what is sharp will be blunted. To accumulate many small imperceptible victories into one great triumph—only the sage can do this. Non-Being enters where there are no gaps. In the *Zhuangzi*’s Outer Chapters, it discusses how the one-legged *kui* and the limbless snake pity each other, yet concludes with the eye pitying the heart. For the feet’s movement has limits it cannot reach, the eye’s vision has bounds it cannot surpass, but only spirit is without direction. In the Inner Chapters, it discusses the master of nurturing life, and moreover the butcher Ding’s carving of the ox. Ding is the yin of fire and the minister of spirit, thus his blade moves with ample room to spare. If one does not embody the boundless and roam without trace, who can enter where there are no gaps? Thus we know the benefit of non-action. The soft overcoming the hard, Non-Being embracing Being—such is the marvelous function of the Dao, truly residing herein.

To abandon affairs is to keep the body from labor; to forget life is to keep the essence from depletion. This is how non-action is beneficial. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them. The teaching without words is established through spirit; the benefit of non-action does not deplete one’s authenticity. The sage embraces simplicity with this, and the world submits. Through non-action, the myriad things are transformed—thus those who attain it are rare.

**Name and Life—Chapter Forty-Four**
Which is dearer, name or life? Which is more, life or wealth? If one’s two arms are weightier than the world, then which is dearer, name or life? Is life only as precious as a Sui pearl? Then which is more, life or wealth? The highest aspiration lies within me—name is not what I hold dear. The greatest wealth lies within me—wealth is not what I value. Only those who do not discern the distinction between near and far, much and little, harm their lives and injure their natures, sacrificing themselves for externals. Was it not deluded for Boyi to die for fame beneath Mount Shouyang, or for Robber Zhi to die for profit upon Dongling? Those who understand the essence of life do not pursue what is of no true benefit—this is how those who possess the Dao differ from the vulgar.

Which is more harmful, gain or loss? The knight errant dies for fame; the greedy man dies for profit. What they gain is name and wealth, but what they lose is the uncarved simplicity of namelessness and the unadorned body—what harm could be greater? Thus excessive love must lead to great expenditure; hoarding much must lead to heavy loss. Without longing for externals, one’s essence remains undiminished. Without entanglement in things, one’s hold is unbroken. The weighing of taking and giving, the alternation of accumulation and dispersal—these reach their limit with certainty, like a cycle. How can this be long-lasting? Knowing contentment, one avoids disgrace. Abiding in the measure of non-excess—what disgrace can there be? Knowing when to stop, one avoids peril. Roaming where the myriad things end and begin—thus one is free from the peril of danger. This can be long-lasting.

Things gather and disperse; nature knows no past or present. The people of the world exchange their natures for things, thus they love fame and pursue profit, bringing disgrace and endangering themselves. The sage fulfills his nature and is content. The world is vast, yet he does not harm his life—thus he can be long-lasting and stand alongside Heaven and Earth.

**Great Perfection—Chapter Forty-Five**
Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible. Within the realm, there are Four Great Ones, and the Dao occupies one of them. To embody the Dao’s wholeness is to be called great. Without completion or deficiency, this is called great perfection. Not possessing its completion, thus it seems flawed. Knowing transformation and harmonizing change, yet not clinging to the past—thus its use is inexhaustible. This is why Confucius, who gathered great perfection, was called the timely sage.

**Great Fullness—Chapter Forty-Five (continued)**
Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Pervading all without bound, sustaining the ten thousand beings—this is great fullness. Responding to things with emptiness, employing it with moderation, thus its bestowal never depletes, its use is inexhaustible. A skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if poor; a person of great virtue appears simple-minded.

Great straightness seems bent.
Following the transformations of things, yielding and winding without seeking to impose itself—thus it seems bent.

Great skill seems clumsy.
Shaping the forms of things, whether round or square, curved or straight, without obscuring their subtlety—thus it seems clumsy.

Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
The highest discourse is wordless; this is called great eloquence. Hui Shi’s many arguments were but petty cleverness.

Movement overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.
Clarity and stillness govern the world.
Yang moves and is restless, thus it overcomes cold. Yin rests and is still, thus it overcomes heat. Yet when these two vie with yin and yang without attaining the mean, they become mere disturbances, contending with activity—how can they govern the world? Only without the restlessness that overcomes cold, without the stillness that overcomes heat, can one remain unsupported yet clear, embrace the spirit and be still—then the world will right itself.

**The Way in the World—Chapter Forty-Six**
When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
Those who govern the world by the Dao ensure the people delight in their work and contend for nothing, tending only to their fields.

When the world lacks the Dao, warhorses breed beyond the outskirts.
The strong oppress the weak, the many tyrannize the few—even borders cannot be secured.

No crime is greater than indulging desire.
By not displaying what is desirable, the heart remains undisturbed. When people have desires, they contend even to the point of risking their lives—this is the origin of crime.

No calamity is greater than discontent.
Contentment is fortune; excess is calamity. To know contentment is to avoid disgrace—what calamity could there be?

No fault is greater than covetousness.
To desire and obtain is to invite reproach.

Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.
When people see what is desirable, they cease to be content; when they cease to be content, they covet; when they covet, strife arises and chaos ensues. When extremes prevail, warhorses breed beyond the outskirts. Yet if one knows contentment and abides in the natural limits of life, applying no cunning or artifice—daily needs are met in food and drink—what strife or chaos could there be?

**Not Leaving the House—Chapter Forty-Seven**
Without leaving the house, one knows the world.
Without peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.
Though the world is vast, the sage knows it through wisdom; though the Way of Heaven is distant, the sage perceives it through the heart. Wisdom encompasses the ten thousand things, nothing is too remote to discern—thus there is no need to leave the house. The heart, abiding in spirit clarity, illuminates even the obscure—thus there is no need to peer through the window. Zhuangzi said: "In the time it takes to lower and raise one’s gaze, one may caress the lands beyond the four seas"—this is how the sage subtly moves and transforms alone.

The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Does one not return to the heart of Heaven and Earth?
Near at hand, within the body, all principles are complete. To seek them in yin and yang, in measurements and calculations, is to stray ever farther from the Dao and know ever less.

Thus, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without acting.
To know the world through one’s own wisdom is to know without traveling. To see the Way of Heaven through one’s own heart is to name without seeing. Knowing without traveling, naming without seeing—what need is there for action? Lofty indeed are his accomplishments—this is to accomplish without acting.

**Daily Cultivation—Chapter Forty-Eight**
In learning, one daily accumulates.
Through learning, one attains the Dao. Beginning as a scholar, one ends as a sage, daily adding to oneself until the Dao is embodied. Confucius said of Yan Yuan: "I see his progress."

In cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes.
To attain the Dao, one casts off the limbs, dulls the senses, severs form and abandons knowledge, until all affairs are forgotten—this is called diminishing. Lian Boyu, at sixty, transformed sixty times.

Diminish and diminish again, until one reaches non-action.
Then there is nothing that is not done.
Learning exhausts principles to encompass being; the Dao fulfills nature to reach non-being. Diminish and diminish again, until there is nothing that has not begun. That which has never begun is non-action. Serene and unmoving, yet nothing is left undone. Responding, one penetrates the causes of the world. In stillness, one is sagely; in movement, one is kingly.

Thus, those who would take the world always act through non-action.
When they act through action, it is insufficient to take the world.
The world is a great vessel. Those who possess the great vessel cannot be bound by things yet do not reject them—thus they can master things. Therefore, those who take the world always act through non-action. The world is a sacred instrument; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Thus, when they act through action, it is insufficient to take the world.

The sage embodies the Dao and governs the self with authenticity.
The rise of emperors, the founding of kings—these are but incidental responses. The world will naturally submit. King Tai of the Zhou, who abandoned Bin and established his state at the foot of Mount Qi, is an example.

**The Sage’s Heart—Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no fixed heart; he takes the hearts of the people as his heart.
The sage’s heart is the mirror of the ten thousand things. Empty, it can receive; still, it can respond. Like a scale facing forms, it reflects their beauty or ugliness; like an echo answering a sound, it matches its volume—what constancy could there be? Observing the ten thousand things, he knows their nature and follows the people—this is called taking the hearts of the people as his heart. Zhuangzi said: "The lowly, yet one cannot but follow—they are the people."

The good, I treat as good; the not-good, I also treat as good—thus virtue is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue is trustworthiness.
Good and bad oppose each other; truth and falsehood mock each other—these are the ways of the world, creating distinctions for themselves. How can this be virtue?

Yet when the sage is in the world, he harmonizes with it, treating all things as one. The people fix their eyes and ears upon him, and he treats them as his children.

When virtue is goodness, one sees all conduct as nothing but good—thus even the not-good is treated as good. When virtue is trustworthiness, one sees all dispositions as inherently untrustworthy—thus even the untrustworthy is trusted. Forgetting both truth and falsehood, uniting right and wrong under one governance—this is called the person of complete virtue. This is how Shun, in his dealings with Xiang, maintained sincerity and rejoiced in him.

When the sage is in the world, he trembles with care for the world, merging his heart with it. While he dwells in the world, fortune and misfortune share the same breath as the people. Though he has no constant heart, he cannot but remain vigilant. Thus, in cultivating himself, he trembles without rest; in governing the world, he equalizes good and bad, unites trust and deceit, forgets both, and seals off his praises, merging all into oneness. The people all fix their eyes and ears upon him, and the sage treats them as children.

Heaven sees through the eyes of the people; Heaven hears through the ears of the people. Thus the sage takes the hearts of the people as his heart. When the sage acts, the ten thousand things behold him, and so the people all fix their eyes and ears upon him. If the people’s seeing and hearing are the sage’s seeing and hearing, then the sage is the father and mother of the people. With compassion and care, he shelters them as one protects an infant, and his benevolence covers the world.

**Chapter Fifty: Emerging from Life, Entering Death**

Emerging from life, entering death. The ten thousand things all emerge from the mechanism and enter the mechanism. The great mechanism unfolds of itself, and with emergence comes life; the heavenly mechanism ceases of itself, and with entry comes death. Life is the beginning of transformation; death is the change of yin and yang.

Those who follow life number thirteen; those who follow death number thirteen. Those who accompany life and death, emerging and entering the mechanism of life and death, are fundamentally not free from encumbrance. The people’s lives, when set in motion, lead to the realm of death—also thirteen. Coveting life and turning from principle, losing their minds to pursue profit, the lives of ordinary people, when set in motion, lead to the realm of death. In such cases, how do their lives differ from death?

Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to life. Those who follow life delight in life and burden their forms; those who follow death hasten toward stillness and forget their bodies. When set in motion toward the realm of death, the cangues and pillories stand in rows, and the executed lie in sight of one another. All this comes from not knowing that the body is the greatest affliction, that life has its limits, and that preserving life to excess is the error.

Those of old who attained the Dao did not use wealth and honor to nourish what harms the body, nor did they allow poverty and lowliness to burden their forms with profit. They did not rejoice in long life nor grieve over early death. With dawn-like clarity, they perceived the solitary, and thus transcended past and present, entering the realm of neither death nor life.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers when traveling on land, nor are they struck by weapons when entering battle. The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn; the tiger has no place to set its claws; weapons have no place to lodge their blades. Why is this so? Because they dwell in no realm of death.

Those skilled in nurturing life preserve their forms and restore their essence, uniting with Heaven as one. Their heavenly integrity remains whole; their spirit does not retreat. They traverse narrow paths without obstruction, tread fire without heat, walk above the ten thousand things without fear, and thus bend things without breaking them—nothing can harm them.

The *Book of Changes* says: "One who penetrates the Dao of day and night emerges and enters the mechanism of life and death—there is nothing that does not do so." One who understands the explanation of life and death and transcends it, penetrating what things are made of—is this not the perfected person?

**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Gives Them Life**

The Dao ever acts through non-action yet leaves nothing undone. The ten thousand things thrive in abundance, all growing from non-action. Virtue nurtures them, and what enables things to live is called virtue. Things take form, retaining movement to generate beings—what completes their patterns is called form. Circumstances complete them. Once form and substance are fully possessed, their configuration takes shape: length and shortness stand in contrast, high and low incline toward one another—such is their inherent tendency.

Thus, the ten thousand things all honor the Dao and esteem virtue. That to which the ten thousand things all turn their heads is the Dao. That which brings them to completion and elevates them is virtue. Honored, it can overcome things and diminish them; esteemed, nothing can debase it. Mencius said: "What the Lord of Zhao esteems, the Lord of Zhao can debase"—this is not due to virtue. The honor of the Dao, the esteem of virtue, are not conferred by rank but are ever spontaneous.

Things may decay in time, circumstances may topple in time, but the true ruler transcends the world, possessing true nobility within, not relying on external circumstances, and ever remains self-possessed. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, nurtures them, makes them grow, rears them, completes them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them. Spoken of separately, there are distinctions between Dao, virtue, circumstances, and things; spoken of together, all emerge from the Dao.

The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things. When the ten thousand things transform and arise, the Dao gives life with them; when the ten thousand things withdraw and store away, the Dao brings them to completion with them. It emerges in *Zhen*, completes in *Gen*, nourishes in *Kun*, and shelters in *Qian*. Hard and soft grind against one another, the eight trigrams surge together—it is as if there were a mechanism that cannot cease, yet the Dao truly enfolds it all.

It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue. Life begins in movement and emergence; action is manifested in transformation and change; leadership is seen in unity and governance. The Dao descends and resides in virtue.

Yet it gives life without claiming merit, acts without relying on ability, leads without displaying the craft of control—who but those who grasp the subtlety of virtue could attain this? Thus it is called profound virtue.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: The World Has a Beginning**
The world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world. The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Both beginning and mother are the Dao.

From the inception of qi, it is called the beginning; from its ceaseless generation, it is called the mother. Having a beginning, it can generate without end. Having grasped the mother, one knows her children. The Dao can mother the ten thousand things and nurture them, so things are her children. Those who penetrate the Dao embrace all things, and thus things attain their mother and know their children.

Having known the children, one returns to guard the mother, and to the end of one’s days will not be imperiled. To hear much yet guard it with simplicity, to see much yet guard it with loftiness, to exhaust the principles of things without being burdened by them, to reach the subtleties of the Dao without losing its wonder—then one’s utility in going out and coming in will be inexhaustible. One can preserve life, fulfill one’s years, and be free from the peril of danger.

Block the openings, close the gates, and to the end of one’s life will not be wearied. The "openings" refer to delight; the "gates" refer to going out. When things entice from without, the heart delights within. Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—from these the spirit and intelligence emerge. Be cautious within, close off without; do not take delight in engaging with things. If things cannot draw one in, then one will find joy in Heaven and be self-content—who would toil to make things one’s concern?

Open the openings, aid in affairs, and to the end of one’s life will not be saved. Seeing what is specious and delightful, one engages and schemes, pursuing tasks—then one clashes and grinds against things, toiling endlessly without seeing success.

To see the small is called illumination. The small is the subtlety of the Dao. Those who see the subtlety of the Dao know themselves, and thus nothing is not illuminated. To guard the soft is called strength. The soft is the root of the Dao. Those who guard the root of the Dao overcome themselves, and thus nothing cannot be overcome.

Use its light, return to its illumination. Illumination is the essence of light; light is the function of illumination. The sage’s response to the world arises from essence to function—when radiance scatters as light, when function is gathered back to essence, wisdom becomes penetrating as illumination. It is displayed in benevolence, concealed in utility, like the sun and moon and the ten thousand things, all illuminated and bright, never diminished. This is how one spiritually perfects virtue.

To leave no calamity to oneself is called inheriting the constant. The transformations of things have no constancy. Only those who return to their mandate leave things and depart from people, returning to illumination without being transformed along with things. Thus they embody constancy and are free from harm, unlike those who scheme with form to perfect their light.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: If I Had but Slight Knowledge**
If I had but slight knowledge and walked the great Dao, I would only fear deviating from it. The Dao rejects extravagance and excess. Extravagance leads to dissipation of virtue; excess leads to indulgence of nature—these are deviations.

"Slight" means being small yet discerning of things. Being slightly discerning of things and inwardly knowing oneself, one deepens the root and strengthens the stem, drawing sufficiency from within—thus one only fears deviation.

The great Dao is very level, yet the people prefer byways. The Dao is level, but byways are quick. Seeking speed to attain near-term success, one strays far from the Dao. The court is excessively adorned, the fields are excessively overgrown, the granaries are excessively empty.

Exalting the worthy and employing the capable to bring order to the court, yet not knowing to exert effort in farming and accumulate resources to foster a prosperous populace—this is pursuing the branch and abandoning the root, not a way that can endure. Adorning oneself in fine colors, girding sharp swords, sating oneself with food and drink, possessing surplus wealth and resources—this is called the boastful thief. Is this not far from the Dao?

Those within the contract walk the path of namelessness; those outside the contract set their minds on expected expenditures. Walking the path of namelessness, one only fears deviation; setting one’s mind on expected expenditures, one takes pride in fine colors, sharp swords, sated appetites, and surplus wealth, considering it honorable rather than shameful. Extravagance destroys righteousness, arrogance and excess lead to boasting—how can this be the Dao?

**Chapter 54: The Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted**

What is well-established cannot be uprooted;
it is rooted in the center to encompass above and below, thus it cannot be uprooted.
What is well-embraced cannot be lost;
it embraces the One to respond to ten thousand changes, thus it cannot be lost.
Descendants continue their sacrifices without cease.

Establishing the center without straying from the Dao,
embracing the One without departing from essence—
such as this, how could it be confined to ruling a single state or a single generation?
It will extend to all under heaven and to future ages;
its transmission is far-reaching indeed.

Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.
Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.
Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful.
Cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.

Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true—
this is what is meant by "the truth of the Dao for governing the self."
Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant;
cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring—
this is what is meant by "its remaining threads for governing others."
Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful;
cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal—
this is what is meant by "its unadorned simplicity for governing the state and all under heaven."

The farther one cultivates, the broader one’s virtue;
what is within me is all its truth, while what is in others is but its branches.
Thus, abundance precedes endurance, and bounty precedes universality—
these are external to the Dao.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe all under heaven through all under heaven.
All things are complete within me;
turning inward to sincerity, there is no greater joy.
Thus, observe the self through the self, and the self is well-governed—
extend this principle to all things.

All under heaven has its constant nature;
observe it through this, and all under heaven is well-governed.
How do I know the nature of all under heaven?
By this.
Simplicity and ease grasp the principle of all under heaven.

**Chapter 55: The Profoundly Virtuous Are Like an Infant**

One profoundly virtuous is like a newborn child.
Though people’s lives are rich, they are swayed by external things;
one profoundly virtuous is not swayed by things,
thus their qi is focused and their will is unified.
Mencius said: "The great person does not lose the heart of a child."

Poisonous insects do not sting them,
fierce beasts do not seize them,
birds of prey do not strike them.
One profoundly virtuous—
sorrow and misfortune cannot enter,
perverse qi cannot assail,
thus nothing can harm them.
Zhuangzi said: "One who can empty the self to wander through the world—who can harm them?"

Bones weak, sinews soft, yet their grip is firm;
knowing nothing of the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs—
this is the perfection of essence.
One whose virtue is whole has a whole form;
thus, bones weak and sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.
One whose form is whole has a whole spirit;
thus, knowing nothing of the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs.
The perfection of essence can enter the spiritual—
Zhuangzi said: "The sage values essence."

Crying all day without hoarseness—
this is the perfection of harmony.
Attaining unity is called essence;
with essence, virtue is whole and spirit is not diminished.
The qi of the void becomes harmony;
with harmony, qi is whole and the voice does not grow hoarse.

In human life,
essence is received from the One of heaven and becomes the source of wisdom;
harmony is received from the Five of heaven and becomes the root of trust.
At its utmost, it can enter the spiritual and return to one’s mandate.
Yet those who lose the heart of a child—
their essence wavers and cannot be preserved,
their qi is violent and impure,
their form and nature are scattered,
dissipated among the ten thousand things—
is this not lamentable?

Knowing harmony is called constancy;
guarding the purity of qi, life is governed from within,
form changes yet nature does not perish.
Knowing constancy is called illumination;
illumination suffices to see the Dao,
for one knows that nature does not perish.
To increase life is called ominous;
omens are the first signs of things.
The principle of life—
to augment it is superfluous,
for fortune and misfortune are not yet determined.
The heart directing qi is called force;
when the body aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with qi,
then qi is harmonious and not violent.
Stumbling or rushing—
this is qi, yet the heart truly directs it—
this is called force.
To oppose things with it is not the way of self-mastery.

Things in their prime grow old—
this is called not following the Dao.
The Dao has no past or present,
yet things have their prime and their decline.
Strength may turn to weakness,
prosperity may turn to decay—
bound by time and constrained by fate,
how can this be the Dao?
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.
The Dao has never had an end,
yet the people’s delusion has long been entrenched.

---

**Chapter 56: The Knowing Do Not Speak**

Those who know do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
The Dao cannot be questioned,
and questions receive no answer.
One who knows the Dao is silent and comprehends it,
having no need to speak.
Nie Que asked Wang Ni four questions,
and four times received no answer—
excessive speech leads to exhaustion,
and strays far from the Dao.

Block the openings, close the gates—
smooth the paths and guard the spirit,
withdraw and conceal in secrecy.
Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots—
take depth as the root, simplicity as the guiding principle.
Harmonize the light, merge with the dust—
flow with things and move with their waves.
This is called profound sameness.

The Dao returns to the utmost subtlety,
uniting in the utmost oneness—
the utmost subtlety is called the profound,
the utmost oneness is called sameness.
In profound sameness,
the ten thousand things and I—
how could one choose among them?
How could one be so petty as to entangle oneself in closeness and distance, benefit and harm, nobility and baseness?

One cannot be made close,
one cannot be made distant,
one cannot be made to benefit,
one cannot be made to harm,
one cannot be made noble,
one cannot be made base—
thus one is honored by all under heaven.

People of the world attack one another with love and hate,
displaying intimacy and distance;
their emotions and falsities interact,
giving rise to views of benefit and harm;
their uses and abandonments vie with one another,
creating distinctions of nobility and baseness.
Reversing and alternating without end—
how could this be worthy of honor in all under heaven?

One who knows the Dao forgets words;
one who forgets words erases likes and dislikes,
dispels emotions and falsities,
transcends uses and abandonments,
and merges in profound sameness within the unity of nature.
True honor is most sufficient;
all under heaven is forgotten—
thus one is honored by all under heaven.

---

**Chapter 57: Govern the State with Rectitude**

Govern the state with rectitude,
deploy troops with the extraordinary,
and win all under heaven through non-action.
Rectitude is the Dao’s constancy,
the extraordinary its adaptation,
non-action its truth.
The state is stabilized by rectitude,
victory in war achieved by the extraordinary—
the truth of the Dao admits no partiality.
Accord with the natural course of things,
and all under heaven is well-governed.

How do I know this is so?
The more taboos and prohibitions in the world,
the poorer the people grow.
The people are not hard to gather—
cherish them and they draw near,
benefit them and they come;
impose what they detest and they scatter.
Now, without cherishing or benefiting them,
but with many prohibitions and taboos,
the people will scatter to the four directions,
and thus grow ever poorer.

The more sharp instruments people possess,
the more benighted the state becomes.
Where there are clever devices, there are cunning affairs;
where there are cunning affairs, there are scheming minds.
Scheming minds arise, and unadulterated simplicity is lost,
while some deceive their superiors by means contrary to the Dao.

The more people rely on skill and craft,
the more strange artifacts proliferate.
When skill and craft prevail, people turn to trivial pursuits,
and outlandish garments and bizarre implements emerge to disrupt customs.
The more elaborate the laws and decrees,
the more thieves and bandits appear.
Excessive scrutiny and enforcement
inevitably evoke unworthy responses.

Thus the sage declares:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
heaven practices non-action and thereby attains clarity,
earth practices non-action and thereby attains tranquility.
When the two non-actions converge,
the myriad things are transformed.
The sage is but heaven and earth—
thus the people say they turn toward goodness,
yet do not know who brings it about.

I favor stillness, and the people rectify themselves.
As a mirror reflects form in water,
without contriving wisdom,
the square and round, crooked and straight of things
cannot escape its clarity—
how could this depend on compass and square?

I practice non-action, and the people enrich themselves.
All under heaven is originally without trouble;
it is the meddlesome who disturb it.
Cease such disturbance,
and the people will enrich themselves.

I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.
Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;
do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.
Align with the absence of desire,
and the people’s nature is preserved.

**Chapter 58: Govern with Simplicity***
Govern with simplicity,

Govern the world with *zaiyou*,
and the people know only of its existence,
yet feel no exuberant joy.
The people remain pure and guileless,
embracing plainness and holding to simplicity,
with few selfish desires and scant cravings.

When governance is *chacha*,
combing hair with meticulous strokes,
measuring rice grain by grain for cooking,
whispering in self-congratulation at such acuity—
this is the governance of *chacha*.
The people grow deficient.

Exalt the worthy, and the people contend;
rely on cunning, and the people steal.
Thus, no virtue remains whole.

Disaster leans upon fortune,
fortune harbors disaster—
who knows their ultimate end?

Clarity emerges from obscurity,
order arises from formlessness.
Virtue, wisdom, skill, and knowledge
thrive in affliction.
In the halls of the lofty and wise,
ghosts peer into the chambers.
Know the time, yet do not cling to it;
know your portion, yet do not fix it.
Grasp that beginning and end cannot be contrived,
then how can fortune and disaster,
with their mutual concealments,
have any constancy?

Is there no standard?
If you make those like you and me the standard,
you set the norm.
Yet if they are already like you and me,
how can you set the norm?
If you make those unlike you and me the standard,
you set the norm.
Yet if they are already unlike you and me,
how can you set the norm?
Then who can be the ultimate standard for the world?

The standard becomes the strange,
goodness becomes the ominous.
The people’s delusion
has endured for so long.

All under heaven is but a single *qi*:
today’s right was yesterday’s wrong,
first encounter, then harmony.
The divine and the foul,
the fragrant and the putrid,
mutually transform in cycles.
Thus, the strange and the standard generate each other,
the ominous and the good alternate—
all is the self-so of a single *qi*.

The world has lived long,
minor delusions alter direction,
major delusions alter nature.
The customs of self-interest prevail—
is this not evident?

When fortune and disaster, with their mutual concealments,
are governed by such *chacha*,
how can the people return to their true nature?

Therefore, the sage is square but does not cut,
for the great square has no corners,
abiding without flowing,
leaving no trace of discrimination.

He is upright but not severe,
for great uprightness is not rigid,
pure yet embracing all things,
without the conduct of carving and chiseling.

He is straight but not unrestrained,
luminous but not dazzling.
Straight yet unrestrained breeds arrogance toward others;
luminous yet dazzling invites the trouble of self-display.
Inwardly straight, outwardly yielding,
using his light yet returning to his clarity—
such is the sage alone!

The people’s delusion lies in taking squareness as right,
like Zimo’s clinging to the mean;
or taking uprightness as right,
like Zhongzi’s austerity.
Knowing expansion but not contraction,
knowing prominence but not subtlety,
they flaunt themselves in the corrupt customs of the age,
losing the sage’s wholeness—
how can they govern the world?

How, then, does the sage govern the world?
Thus and only thus.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**
To govern people and serve Heaven, nothing compares to frugality.
Hearing and seeing, wisdom and knowledge—these are of Heaven.
Movement and stillness, thought and deliberation—these are of man.
Harmonizing the rhythms of movement and stillness, reducing the burdens of thought and deliberation—this is how one governs people.
Not exhausting the power of hearing and seeing, not fulfilling the duties of wisdom and knowledge—this is how one serves Heaven. This is called *yin*.
Heaven’s One resides in the viscera, attending to the kidneys. Standing in the garden of no-lending, enriching the source of wisdom while frugally expending—thus human affairs are ordered and Heaven’s principle is attained.
Only through frugality does one return early.
To return only after delusion is late; to return before delusion arises, to practice frugality so as not to indulge one’s nature—this is to return early.
Early return is called "accumulating virtue in layers."
Returning to the root of virtue, returning to self-knowledge—thus the Dao within me daily accumulates and ever renews.
Accumulating virtue in layers, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
To overcome is to be capable of mastery. To govern the myriad things, to command the host of movements, with nothing one cannot overcome—this is virtue alone.
Nothing one cannot overcome—then none know its limit.
When virtue reaches the point of overcoming all, it responds universally without exhaustion—who can know its limit?
None know its limit—thus one may possess the state.
Embodying the inexhaustible, one’s use of the world is ever abundant—how much more so for possessing a state?
The mother of possessing the state can endure long.
The Dao is the mother of the myriad things; those who possess the Dao endure for ten thousand generations without decay.
This is called "deepening the root and firming the stem, the Way of long life and enduring vision."
The Dao is the mother of things, and things are its children. Nature is the root of form, and form is its stem.
Knowing the child, one returns to guard the mother—thus one’s body does not perish, and so may endure long.
Roots deep, stems firm; nature restored, form whole—one becomes constant with Heaven and Earth, thus attaining long life.
One shares radiance with the sun and moon, thus enduring vision.
All things transform with others, yet I alone endure—this is called the Dao.

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**
Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.
Managing the multitude and frequently disturbing them yields little success. Storing great vessels and frequently moving them incurs much damage.
Cooking a small fish and frequently stirring it causes it to disintegrate. Governing a great state and frequently changing laws causes confusion.
Thus, the governance of the Dao values clarity and stillness, and the people naturally settle.
One who guides the world with the Dao—its spirits do not act as spirits.
The sage is the master of spirits, people, and the myriad things. When compelled to govern the world, nothing compares to non-action.
The Dao is ever without action, yet in presiding over the world, none are left ungoverned.
Those who rely on others to act—all are at peace and rest, none emerge to cause harm. Thus it is said, "its spirits do not act as spirits."
It is not that its spirits do not act as spirits, but that their spirit does not harm the people.
It is not that their spirit does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm the people.
When the two do not harm one another, virtue converges upon them.
One who guides the world with the Dao—none act, yet all is naturally so. Without the calamities of war, without the punishments of execution—this is called "not harming the people."
At such a time, spirits and people do not harm one another, and virtue converges upon them.
Spirits have no occasion to display their numinous responses—content with abundant blessings alone.
Thus it is said, "their spirit does not harm the people." The people have no occasion to employ their cunning—daily sustenance and food alone. What harm could there be?

**Chapter 61: A Great State Is the Lower Reaches**
A great state is the lower reaches.
None lack the heart that seeks the high, yet those who seek the high often stumble.
The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is their skill in lowering themselves.
The convergence of the world, the female of the world—the female always overcomes the male with stillness, taking stillness as lowliness.
The world all contends with things through hardness and strength, yet I alone dwell in the realm of softness, stillness, and non-contention—who can overcome me?
This is the Way to converge with the world.
The Classic says: "Know the male, guard the female, and become the world’s stream."
Thus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state, it wins the small state. When a small state lowers itself before a great state, it wins the great state.
Thus, some lower themselves to win, some lower themselves and win.
To desire contraction, one must first firmly expand; to desire taking, one must first firmly give.
A great state desires nothing more than to nurture others; a small state desires nothing more than to serve others.
When both attain what they desire, the greater should be the lower.
Heaven’s Way lowers and bestows illumination, thus nothing is left uncovered. Earth’s Way is lowly yet ascends, thus it can bear Heaven.
Man models Earth, Earth models Heaven—thus the greater should be the lower.

**Chapter 62: The Dao Is the Mystery of the Myriad Things**
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things.
Heaven’s mystery lies in the northwest, where essence transforms in abundance. Earth’s mystery lies in the Yellow Springs, where hidden spirits flourish.
Man’s mystery lies in thought and deliberation, where the utmost spirit is stored.
Heaven, Earth, and man each have what is called "mystery," yet all are enveloped by the Dao.
The Dao—difficult to end, difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to know—thus it is the mystery of the myriad things.
If the Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, then are things the manifestation of the Dao?
The treasure of the good person—
acting upon what is beneficial, accumulating goodness to form nature, and spiritual clarity is naturally attained, the sagely heart follows.
What the unworthy person preserves—
turning away brings nothing but harm; following principle preserves wholeness. Movement brings nothing but deviation; stilling one’s nature brings rectitude—thus one may preserve the body.
Fair words can be traded in the marketplace; esteemed conduct can be imposed upon others.
If people are unworthy, how can they be cast aside?
Words are like wind and waves; conduct is like gain and loss—neither is what the Dao values.
Yet fair words can please, esteemed conduct can be exalted—still they can be traded and imposed upon others, and people submit. How much more so when embodying the mystery of the Dao, universally covering and encompassing all without distinction?

Thus, if people are unworthy, how can they be cast aside? Therefore, though the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, even if one offers a large jade disc followed by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.

The noble person’s preservation lies in cultivating the self so the world is at peace. If the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes possess jade and horses to summon the worthy yet do not devote themselves to advancing the Dao and cultivating the self, they abandon themselves to follow others, losing the way of self-governance. To sit and advance in this Dao is to seek it within oneself alone.

Where the Dao resides, the sage reveres it, and the people follow as if returning to market. Why was this Dao prized in ancient times? Is it not said that by seeking it one obtains, and by it one with transgressions is freed? Thus it is treasured under heaven.

To seek is to obtain—what is sought lies within oneself. That the ancients sought it in yin-yang and calculations yet failed to obtain it was because they sought it externally. The wicked turn toward goodness, the foolish become wise—is this not how those with transgressions are freed? The Dao’s power to save is thus, and so it is treasured under heaven.

The tradition says: Under heaven, nothing is not treasured but the Dao.

**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**
Act without acting, attend to affairs without affairs, savor without savor.
The body of the Dao is without action, thus it is without acting;
without appearance, thus without affairs;
without desire, thus without savor.
The sage responds to the existence of things while embodying the nonexistence of the Dao—from these three, the outline may be seen.

**Great and small, many and few.**
Great and small refer to form; many and few refer to number. The measure of things is boundless, beyond all comparison.
If the great is not many, the small is not few, then who can discern the distinction between the repayment of resentment and kindness?
This is how the sage unites the ten thousand things in the one nonexistence, able to perfect their greatness.

**Repay resentment with virtue.**
If rank and emolument are insufficient to encourage, and execution and shame are insufficient to humiliate, then what resentment can there be? What is esteemed is virtue alone.

**Plan difficulty at its ease, do greatness at its smallness.**
The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy. The great affairs of the world must arise from the small.
A thousand-yard dike collapses from the hole of an ant; a hundred-foot chamber burns from the smoke of a chimney crack.
When Master Bai patrolled the dike, he plugged the holes—thus there was no flood disaster. When the old man was cautious with fire, he sealed the cracks—thus there was no fire calamity.
The affairs of the world often begin in the most minute, and by their end, they cannot be mastered. Therefore the sage acts early.
Thus the sage never acts greatly, yet is able to perfect greatness. By acting in the small, one is able to perfect greatness.
To govern after disorder has already formed—is this not too late?

One who makes light promises is surely lacking in trust; one who treats much as easy will surely encounter much difficulty. Thus the sage takes difficulty as the way, and so ultimately encounters no difficulty.

Disaster is often concealed in the minute and erupts where people are heedless. The sage’s response to the world is ever cautious of the minute and never heedless, thus initially having no light or easy conduct, and ultimately avoiding the calamities of unforeseen difficulties—all by embodying the absence of contrivance.

**Chapter 64: What is Secure is Easily Upheld**
What is secure is easily upheld; what has not yet shown signs is easily planned; what is fragile is easily dissolved; what is minute is easily scattered.
Act before it exists; govern before there is disorder.
Security is the opposite of danger; what has not yet shown signs is the opposite of what has already taken form; fragility is the opposite of firmness; the minute is the opposite of the manifest.
Uphold it in security, and there will be no danger. Plan it before signs appear, and it will not take form.
The sage’s knowledge of the incipient: if the fragile is accompanied, it will not reach solid ice; if the minute is scattered, it will not become manifest.
The worthy person’s nearness to peril is thus.

A cart hurtling toward a rampart, a boat sinking in the current—the sage has no use for wisdom. Why employ wisdom before hurtling or sinking? This is what is meant by acting before it exists and governing before there is disorder.

A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair-fine sprout. A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet.
Among things with form, the great must grow from the small; the high must be founded on the low; the distant must originate from the near.
Its beginning is simple; its completion must be vast.
The sage sees the beginning and thinks of the end, observes the sign and knows the return. Thus they do not precede fortune, nor initiate calamity. They hesitate to initiate affairs, yet always succeed.

Acting leads to failure; grasping leads to loss. Thus the sage acts without acting, and so does not fail; does not grasp, and so does not lose.
The sage does not engage in affairs, thus does not fail. Does not rely on past contrivance to uphold the self, thus does not lose.
The deluded measure and rigidly adhere to them, drifting ever farther from the Dao—how can they avoid failure and loss?

Thus the people’s affairs often fail at the point of near-completion. Stopping midway, abandoning halfway, beginning with diligence and ending in indolence—such is the nature of the common people, and none are otherwise.
Thus affairs often reach failure at the point of near-completion. Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed affairs.

All things have a beginning, but few can bring them to completion. When beginning and end are as one, the moment is ever renewed.
Apply this to affairs—what will not be accomplished?

Thus the sage desires what is undesired, does not prize goods hard to obtain; learns what is unlearned, to restore what the multitude has passed over.
Those who desire profit exchange themselves for things; those who devote themselves to learning drown the heart in breadth.
How can this lead to the attainment of non-action?
The sage does not allow profit to burden the form; desire lies in the absence of desire. The nourishment of self and others is fully sufficient and stops there.
Thus they do not prize goods hard to obtain, do not allow people to obliterate heaven.
Learning lies in the absence of learning, in gathering brilliance in radiance alone. Thus they restore what the multitude has passed over.

The Dao is not made manifest.
The worthy pass it over—how much more the multitude?
Restore their transgressions and return them to their nature—this is why those who cut off learning have no sorrow and find joy.

To assist the natural course of the myriad things and not dare to act—
Heaven is high, earth is low, the myriad things scatter and differ, yet none compels them; it is simply the spontaneity of their nature.
To assist their spontaneity is to perfect their nature.
Those who act ruin it, and thus dare not act.
This is why the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and does not employ cunning or skill.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: Those of Old Skilled in the Dao**
Those of old skilled in the Dao did not use it to enlighten the people but to make them simple.
The people may be guided, but they cannot be made to know—those of old skilled in the Dao merely guided them.
To reverse their habitual ways, the Dao may be carried and journeyed with, without employing cunning or skill; this is called simplicity.
Since the Three Dynasties, men have abandoned tranquility and non-action, delighting instead in the earnest pursuit of ritual and music to rectify the forms of the world, and in the clamor of benevolence and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the world.
They sought to enlighten the people, calling it governance, yet what chaos could be greater?
The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive knowledge.
Whenever the world falls into great disorder, the fault lies in the love of knowledge.
Thus, to govern the state with knowledge is the state’s bane.
Laws emerge, and treachery arises; decrees are issued, and deceit follows.
Not to govern the state with knowledge is the state’s blessing.
Burn the tallies, shatter the seals, and the people return to rustic simplicity; smash the measuring cups, break the scales, and the people cease to contend.
To understand these two paths is to have a model.
Knowing these two paths is to know how to govern the state.
Knowing how to govern the state, the people will emulate and take it as their model.
To constantly know the model is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching, turning back with things.
The profound is the color of heaven; to constantly know the model and not employ one’s knowledge is to unite in virtue with heaven—deep beyond measure, far beyond reach, standing alone above the myriad things, with nothing able to pair with it. Thus it is said to turn back with things.
Then one attains great compliance.
Compliance is the principle of heaven; to attain great compliance is to discard knowledge and contrivance, following only the principle of heaven.
Zhuangzi said: "To unite with heaven and earth, the union is seamless, like simplicity or dullness." This is profound virtue harmonizing with great compliance—only by seeming simple or dull can knowledge be discarded.

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of the Hundred Valleys**
The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in humility; thus they become kings of the hundred valleys.
Those who initiate affairs and create enterprises, if they place themselves above, become rulers. "Ruler" implies the meaning of return and allegiance; if the lord humbles himself to those below, the people will return to him, like water flowing downward.
Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, he places his words below them; if he wishes to lead the people, he places his person behind them.
Thus the sage dwells above, yet the people do not feel burdened; he stands in front, yet the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him and never tires of it.
The *Book of Changes* says in the initial hexagram of *Tun*: "To honor the lowly brings great favor from the people." To win the people is to win their hearts.
Dwelling above yet not burdening the people makes following him effortless; standing in front yet not harming the people makes those who benefit from him numerous.
In this way, there is no thought that does not submit, and thus they do not tire of him.
The *Book of Changes* says: "The hundred clans support the capable." Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.
Acting with worthiness yet abandoning the conduct of self-aggrandizement—where could he go and not be loved?

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World Calls My Dao Great**
The world calls my Dao great, yet it seems unlike anything else.
Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything else.
If it were like anything, it would long since have been small.
That which imitates things is small; that which is imitated by things is great. The Dao covers and sustains the myriad things—vast and boundless, how great it is! Thus it seems unlike anything else.
If it were like anything, the Dao would have something outside itself—how could it be great?
I possess three treasures, which I treasure and hold fast.
Unlike the views of the world, I guard them and do not lose them—these are what I treasure.
The first is compassion;
compassion is to love things, the essence of benevolence.
The second is frugality;
frugality is to suffice with what is needed, the restraint of propriety.
The third is not daring to be first in the world.
To be first is to seek to surpass others, prizing strength and not valuing virtue.
Compassion, therefore, can make one brave—
King Wen regarded the people as if they were wounded; with one display of anger, he pacified the people of the world.
Frugality, therefore, can make one expansive—
storing in winter allows flourishing in spring.
Heaven and earth are always frugal; how much more should humans, who cannot constantly indulge in extravagance and waste?
Not daring to be first in the world, therefore, can make one the leader of all things.
Not contending yet excelling in victory is the Dao of heaven.
The Dao is revered, thus it becomes the leader of all things.
Now, to abandon compassion and yet be brave, to abandon frugality and yet be expansive, to abandon being last and yet be first—this is death.
The people of the world know that bravery suffices to surpass others but do not know that compassion alone can make one brave.
They know that expansiveness suffices to impress the multitude but do not know that restraint alone can make one expansive.
They know that being the leader of all things is worthy of esteem but do not know that being last is essential—thus they are merely the strong and forceful, following the path to death.
Compassion: in battle, it brings victory; in defense, it brings solidity.
The benevolent are invincible in the world; thus in battle, they triumph. The people love their superiors as hands and feet protect the head and eyes, as children and younger brothers defend their fathers and elder brothers, willing to die and not depart—thus in defense, they are solid.
Heaven will save them, protecting them with compassion.
Those devoted to benevolence are inwardly guided by heaven; those devoted to malevolence have their mirror taken by heaven. Thus, what heaven uses to save and protect them is compassion alone—this is why compassion is foremost among the three treasures.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Skilled Warrior**
The skilled warrior is not martial—
martiality is a lesser path; the warrior values the will, saying only "benevolence and righteousness."
Confucius said: "I have not studied the affairs of military campaigns."

**The Skilled Warrior (continued)**

The skilled warrior is not wrathful—
wrath truly overcomes thought.
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy’s strategy.
The skilled conqueror does not contend—
contention is contrary to virtue.

To contend for land is to battle, slaying men until the fields are filled;
to contend for cities is to battle, slaying men until the walls are filled—
yet victory and defeat remain undecided.
Not relying on martial force is how martial force is perfected;
not yielding to wrath is how wrath is mastered;
not contending is how contention is resolved.
These three all arise from virtue—thus they are called "skilled."

The one who excels in employing others humbles themselves.
Though wisdom may encompass all under heaven, they do not rely on their own plans.
Thus, the wise devise strategies for them, though their schemes may exhaust the realm, they do not act for themselves.
The capable are employed in service, though they may craft myriad things, they do not boast of their skill.
The eloquent are sent forth as envoys.
This is called the virtue of non-contention.
Virtue overflows into renown; knowledge emerges from contention.
Those whose talents are complete yet whose virtue remains unmanifest—
one has never heard them lead, only ever harmonizing with others.
This is called employing the strength of others.

The perceptive exhaust their sight and hearing;
the wise and capable exhaust their schemes and skills—
yet the one who appoints them remains without knowledge.
This is called matching heaven, the ultimate principle of antiquity.
To act through non-action is called heaven;
to employ others without contention—thus one may match heaven.
To match heaven is to reach the utmost;
nothing can be added beyond this—thus it is called the ultimate principle of antiquity.
"Ultimate" means "to reach."
The utmost of wood is the ridgepole of a house.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine: On the Use of Arms**
There is a saying in warfare:
"I dare not act as the host but as the guest."
The one who provokes is the host; the one who responds is the guest.
To move only when pressed, to rise only when unavoidable—this is called responsive warfare.
Responsive warfare is to act as the guest.
"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot."
Not delighting in killing, thus difficult to advance yet easy to retreat.
This is called "marching without a formation"—
the skilled warrior is not martial, moving without leaving traces.
"Repelling without arms"—
the skilled warrior is not wrathful.
"Pursuing without an enemy"—
the skilled conqueror does not contend.
"Wielding without weapons"—
employing the strength of others, as if no weapon were held.

No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy;
underestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.
To underestimate the enemy is to delight in war;
to delight in war is to take pleasure in killing.
Those who take pleasure in killing forfeit their compassion and lose the heart to cherish the people and love all things—
they cannot realize their will in the world.
Thus, when armies clash, the side that mourns prevails.
The sage’s use of arms is to rescue the people from the midst of fire and water,
taking only what is broken.
Divine martiality does not kill, holding compassion as its treasure.
Thus, with sevenfold subtlety, none under heaven do not embrace it;
with righteous subtlety, none under heaven do not stand in awe—
this is called constant victory.

**Chapter Seventy: Words Easily Known**
My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice—
yet none under heaven can know them, none can practice them.
The Way shines clearly and is easily seen—
thus, when expressed in words, it is very easy to know;
its essentials are easily grasped—
thus, when manifested in affairs, it is very easy to practice.
Mencius said: "The Way is like a great road—how could it be difficult to know?"
Thus, the Way presents no difficulty, and none under heaven are incapable—
those who find it difficult or impossible simply do not turn inward to seek within themselves.

Words have their origin; affairs have their lord.
Words cannot be exhausted, yet principle is their root.
Affairs cannot be fully met, yet the Way is their master.
Follow principle in seeking; follow the Way in acting—
nothing under heaven is then difficult.

It is only due to lack of knowledge that they do not know me.
The knowledge of petty men does not extend beyond documents and records—
though they claim to have knowledge, in truth they are without it.
How could they suffice to know the Way?
Those who know me are few—thus I am esteemed.
Those who possess conduct surpassing the world are reviled by the multitude;
those who harbor thoughts of solitary wisdom are startled by the people—
thus, there are those who are valued for their rarity.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**
To know the unknown is supreme.
The essence of the utmost Way is profound and obscure;
the ultimate of the utmost Way is dim and silent.
Knowledge lies without; the unknown lies within.
Knowledge is shallow; the unknown is deep.
To know and call it unknown—this is true knowledge,
the utmost of the Way—thus it is called supreme.

Not to know yet claim to know is a malady.
Not knowing the essence of the utmost Way yet knowing the coarse details of things;
not knowing the ultimate of the utmost Way yet knowing the trivial ends of things—
one is then driven by threads and ensnared by objects,
daily drawing nearer to the path of sorrow and calamity—thus it is a malady.
Only by recognizing the malady as a malady is one not afflicted.

To know one’s foolishness is not great foolishness;
to know one’s confusion is not great confusion.
Great confusion lasts a lifetime without resolution;
great foolishness lasts a lifetime without awakening.
The sage is without malady because he recognizes the malady as a malady—
thus he is without malady.
The sage moves plainly yet is ashamed to be entangled in affairs,
establishes the root and knows the subtleties of the spirit—
possessing true knowledge, he constantly appears as if he does not know—
thus he is without malady.

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**
When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives.
Petty men regard small evils as harmless and do not cast them aside—
thus evils accumulate until they cannot be dispelled.
The *Book of Changes* says: "Carrying a cangue until the ears are destroyed—misfortune."
Do not constrict their dwelling—
dwelling is the abode of nature; human nature is so vast it cannot be encompassed.
Yet cramped scholars cannot be spoken to of the Way because their dwelling is constricted.
Expand and fill it, and it will fill heaven and earth, enveloping the six directions—
nothing will then be impossible.
Mencius said: "Dwell in the broadest dwelling of the world."
Do not weary of what gives them life—
life is the gathering of qi; human life is connected to what creates things.
Yet those who weary of what gives them life—
their daily conduct shackles and loses it.
When shackles are repeatedly applied, the night’s qi is insufficient to preserve it.
Only by preserving the great harmony without premature demise—
by not wearying of what gives them life—can this be achieved.

Only by not wearying of it does one not weary of it. Misfortune and fortune are none but self-sought. Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself, loves himself but does not exalt himself. Therefore he discards that and takes this.

The sage possesses the clarity of self-knowledge yet does not display himself to flaunt his ability. He holds the benevolence of self-love yet does not exalt himself to lord over others. Such a one dwells among things without harming them, and nothing can harm him. Rejoicing in Heaven and free from care, what dread has he of might or wrath?

The sage’s choice to discard and take is thus made clear.

**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring Leads to Killing**
Boldness in daring leads to killing; boldness in not daring leads to life. The rigid and strong belong to the party of death; the soft and weak belong to the party of life. Boldness in daring is mere recklessness—able to be bold but unable to be cautious. This is no true mastery, only a path to self-destruction. Thus Confucius said of Zilu, who loved boldness, that he was "of no use as timber."

Boldness in not daring, however, knows how to hold back. Holding back is the way to stand ahead. Liezi said: "In the world, there is a constant victor—softness." These two—daring and restraint—bring either benefit or harm. What is upright may err; what is contrary may fit. What Heaven abhors, who knows the reason? What strays from man is aligned with Heaven.

What man deems beneficial, Heaven deems abhorrent. Who can truly know this? Even the sage finds it difficult. Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish. Not even the sage dares alter this.

The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory. When the myriad things emerge, it emerges with them yet does not refuse; when they return, it returns with them yet does not obstruct. This is called "not contending." It waxes and wanes, full and empty, moving with things. The multitude of beings all receive their mandate—this is "not contending yet excelling at victory."

It does not speak yet responds with goodness. What does Heaven say? It transforms with thunder and wind, reveals fortune and misfortune, without the slightest deviation, answering like an echo. It does not summon yet comes of itself. When a being receives its mandate, the one who bestows it can summon it. Yet amid the tangled profusion of the myriad things, Heaven governs their mandates—who can summon them?

It moves ceaselessly, entrusting itself to the self-motion of the single qi. Serene and adept in strategy, its actions are ever easy, for it knows peril. Heaven’s net is vast and wide-meshed, yet nothing slips through. What seems loose has no gaps—this is Heaven’s way. What seems dense with gaps is man’s doing. Accumulated good and evil bring blessings and calamities, each arriving according to its kind. This is how nothing is lost.

To contend and then prevail, to speak and then respond—this is man’s way. Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory, does not speak yet responds with goodness, and when summoned, it comes. Man finds it hard to know Heaven, for Heaven does not wait to be summoned but comes of itself, serene and adept in strategy. Only the sage can embody this. Thus he neither pursues profit nor flees harm, ever benefiting without harm—thereby uniting with Heaven in virtue, unlike those bold in daring.

**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**
The people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? When the people have a constant heart, life is joyful. If they lack a constant heart, what fear have they of death? Axes and saws shape them, inked lines and mallets carve them—this is to threaten them with death, yet they resist and remain unchanged.

If the people always feared death and acted perversely, should I seize and kill them? Who would dare? When the world delights in life and values transgression lightly, then those who speak perversely face execution, and those who act strangely face prohibition. As Xunzi said, "The crime of violating governance is grave indeed."

There is always an executioner who kills. To kill in place of the executioner is to hew in place of the master carpenter. The ruler must act without action and employ the world; the subject must act and be employed by the world—this is the unchanging Way. To kill in place of the executioner, to hew in place of the master carpenter, is for ruler and subject to share the same virtue, inverting the Way in speech and opposing it in principle. What man governs can hardly govern others.

King Wen did not personally attend to every word, every lawsuit, every caution—he entrusted these to his officials. To hew in place of the master carpenter is seldom without injury to one’s hands. If even hewing risks injury, how much more so killing? This is why the ancients valued non-action. Through non-action, those charged with affairs bear responsibility.

**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**
The people’s hunger comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—this is why they hunger. Heavy levies leave fields overgrown and people without food.

The people are hard to govern because their superiors act—this is why they are hard to govern. Excessive governance breeds deceit and falsehood, and the people lose their simplicity.

The people make light of death because they overvalue life’s lavishness—this is why they make light of death. When attachment to life is too great, desires for profit grow urgent, and every depravity and excess is pursued. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to are wiser than those who prize life.

Zhuangzi said: "Those who understand life’s nature do not strive for what life cannot provide." Those who do not treat life as something to be clung to do not strive for what life cannot provide. They abandon affairs and forget life. Abandoning affairs, the body is not wearied; forgetting life, the essence is not depleted. With body whole and essence restored, they unite with Heaven—this is why they are wiser than those who prize life.

Prizing life differs from making light of death; forgetting life surpasses prizing life. Extend what benefits your own life to the people: lighten taxes, simplify punishments, ensure households are provided for and people are content. Let robes and caps be plain, let distinctions in dress be clear, and the people will not transgress—this is the ultimate achievement of emperors and kings.

**Chapter 76: Man’s Life**
In life, man is soft and weak; in death, he is hard and strong.

Grasses and trees in life are soft and fragile; in death, they are withered and dry. Thus, the hard and strong belong to the cohort of death, while the soft and weak belong to the cohort of life. All things bear yin and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Yang’s virtue is to bring forth life, while yin’s function is to bring sternness and decay. When sternness and decay prevail, the harmonious blending of qi is lost. Hence it is said: the hard and strong belong to the cohort of death, while the soft and weak belong to the cohort of life.

Therefore, when armies grow strong, they do not prevail. When opposing forces clash, the side that mourns emerges victorious. When wood grows strong, it is felled and made into beams. The paulownia and catalpa, slender enough to clasp with both hands, are nurtured by all—yet when they grow strong, they are cut down and used. Thus, the hard and strong dwell below, while the soft and weak rise above. The soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong—this is where the Daoist arts of Laozi reside. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Take gentleness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as your outward form."

**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**
Is not the Way of Heaven like the drawing of a bow? What is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted up. What has surplus is reduced, what is deficient is supplemented. The Dao neither adds nor diminishes, but things have their fullness and emptiness. That which can be poured into without filling, drawn from without being exhausted—this is what the sage preserves. Descending into the realm of things, even Heaven and Earth have their fullness and emptiness, waxing and waning with the seasons—how much more so for man?

The Way of Heaven takes the mean as its ultimate standard. Thus, what is high is pressed down so it does not become excessive, and what is low is lifted up so it does not become deficient. What is to come advances, what has succeeded retreats—like the four seasons in their ceaseless rotation, each in its proper order. The Way of Heaven reduces the surplus to supplement the deficient.

Fullness invites loss, humility brings gain—this is the rhythm of Heaven’s Way. The way of man, however, is not so: it reduces the deficient to serve the surplus. The human heart rejects the lowly and advances the exalted, covets solitary glory and fears brilliance. Who can reduce the surplus to serve the deficient throughout the world? Only the Dao. Not oppressing the gloriously solitary but emptying oneself to share with them, not fearing brilliance but reducing the abundant to aid the needy—none but the man of Dao can do this.

Thus, the sage acts but does not rely on his actions, accomplishes but does not dwell in his achievements. Does he not wish to display his worth? He does not rely on his actions, so he has no mind for self-promotion. He does not dwell in his achievements, so he has no ambition for self-satisfaction. While others adorn their wisdom, he alone appears foolish. While others seek victory, he alone bends to preserve wholeness. Precisely because he does not wish to display his worth, he remains unharmed and attains the Way of Heaven.

**Chapter 78: The Softness of the World**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—because nothing can replace it. The *Book of Changes* uses the well as a metaphor for nature, speaking of its unchanging essence. Laozi calls water "nearly the Dao" because nothing can replace it. If something could replace it, one would follow others and lose oneself—how then could one overcome things? Only by having nothing that can replace it does one remain constant amid ten thousand changes, so that nothing can overcome it.

That the soft overcomes the hard and the weak overcomes the strong—none in the world do not know this, yet none can practice it. Knowledge reaches it, but benevolence cannot preserve it. Therefore, the sage says: "He who bears the disgrace of the state is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain. He who bears the misfortune of the state is called the king of all under Heaven." Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and forests conceal pests, and the ruler of the state endures disgrace—embodying the emptiness of the Dao, the more he receives, the more vast his capacity. Thus, he becomes the refuge of all things, and his dominion extends ever further.

The *Classic* says: "Know honor, yet guard disgrace—become the valley of the world." Straightforward words seem contradictory. Yet words are not confined to one meaning; to reverse course and align with the Dao amid the turbid is called the ultimate correctness of the world.

**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Resentment**
In reconciling great resentment, there will inevitably remain residual resentment. How can this be considered good? The avenger does not break the enemy’s sword, and though one may harbor a vengeful heart, one does not resent a tile that falls by chance—thus, no residual resentment remains. Loving others is the root of harming them. Laying down arms is the root of creating arms. How can this be considered good?

Therefore, the sage holds the left tally but does not demand from others. The sage follows great transformations without obstruction, receiving and approving of them—thus, he makes no demands of others, and others make none of him. Tallies have left and right to distinguish giving and taking. Holding the left tally means only to give. Thus, the man of virtue oversees the tally, distributing virtue to others—this is called sageliness. The man without virtue oversees exactions. Delighting in the free flow of things is not sageliness. The man without virtue does not find contentment in his own gains but seizes the gains of others. As he seeks to connect with everything, he harbors a heart of resentment—this is exaction, the very source of obstruction. As *Zhuangzi* says: "He who loses himself in things is called the benighted people."

The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly bestows upon the good. If one is good, it bestows—what partiality is there?

**Chapter 80: Small States with Few People**
Small states with few people...

With vast territories and teeming populations, affairs become unmanageable, wisdom insufficient for scrutiny, and virtue begins to decline. Punishment arises from this, and the chaos of later ages originates here. As the Laozi emerged at the end of the Zhou, weary of its disorder, it sought the intent of the Dao and embedded it in writing. It aimed to remedy the corruption of an over-civilized age and guide it toward a realm of purity and simplicity. Thus, it spoke of "small states with few people." For in the era of utmost virtue—from Rongcheng to Shennong, twelve rulers in all—this alone was called perfect governance.

Let the people possess tools of myriad uses yet never employ them. Let them be unified without faction, free from the burdens of excess. Let them value life and not wander far. Their lives may be joyful, their deaths properly mourned, so they do not lightly risk death or flee to distant lands. Confucius said: "When those above lose the Way, the people scatter—has this not long been so?" Is not "wandering far" the very term for it?

Though there be boats and carriages, none ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, none array them. Mountains lack paths and tunnels; marshes lack boats and bridges. Alike in ignorance, their virtue remains unbroken. Without perilous trails, though boats and carriages exist, none use them. Without the calamity of war, though armor and weapons exist, none deploy them. Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping—sufficient for essentials, no need for written tallies.

Let them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their customs peaceful, their labors joyful. Tilling to eat, weaving to clothe, they play with mouths full and stroll with bellies full—this alone suffices for the people. Content with their lot, they find it sweet; eschewing ornament, they find it fine; undisturbed, they find it peaceful; preserving life, they find it joyful.

Neighboring states may gaze upon one another; the sounds of chickens and dogs may carry between them. Yet let the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another. Though they dwell in proximity and hear each other’s voices, they do not interact. In such an age, without desires or demands, nothing is done, yet all unfolds naturally—this is called utmost virtue.

**Chapter 81: Truthful Words Are Not Fine**
Truthful words are not fine. The Dao uttered is bland, without flavor, yet it surpasses all sages without shame and endures through the ages without flaw. Fine words are not truthful. Ornate speech is flowery; pursuing florid rhetoric, it treats embellishment as substance—thus it lacks trustworthiness.

The good do not argue. Their words uphold essentials, speaking only what accords with principle. Those who argue are not good. Their speech bristles with digressions, losing the world’s perfect uprightness.

The wise are not encyclopedic. They grasp the Dao’s subtle essence, returning to essentials alone. The encyclopedic are not wise. Vast learning in sights and sounds does not compare to restraint. As *Zhuangzi* says: "Breadth does not necessarily mean wisdom; eloquence does not necessarily mean intelligence."

The sage accumulates nothing. To accumulate is to be deficient. To hoard nothing is to have abundance. *Zhuangzi* says: "The sagely Dao flows without accumulation." Confucius said: "Thus I say: I emulate the ancients." Having given to others, one possesses more; having bestowed upon others, one gains more.

Excellent in lending and perfecting, yet never depleting oneself. All things turn to it for sustenance, yet it is never exhausted. The Way of Heaven benefits without harming. Qian, in its inception, bestows abundant blessings upon the world, never claiming credit, yet all things truly benefit—never has it caused harm.

The Way of the sage acts without contention. Flowing without resistance, its movement is like water; responding without hoarding, its stillness is like a mirror. Harmonizing without leading, its response is like an echo. Though it acts, its action arises from non-action. Embodying Heaven alone—what contention could there be?

This virtue aligns with the Dao. Thus, the *Virtue Classic* concludes here. The Imperial Commentary on the *Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Volume Four, ends.
