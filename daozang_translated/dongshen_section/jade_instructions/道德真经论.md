**Title:** *Treatise on the Dao De Classic*. Annotated by Sima Guang (宋司马光注). Four volumes. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), under the category of *Divine Essence and Supreme Purity* (洞神都) *Jewel Precepts* (玉诀类). The original text lacks chapter titles; these are added according to Wang Bi’s (王弼) version.

**Volume One of the *Treatise on the Dao De Classic* – Sima Guang’s Annotations**

The Grand Historian (太史公) said: The *Laozi* composed a book in two parts, upper and lower, expounding the meaning of *Dao* and *De*. Later generations, taking the opening phrases of each section, named the upper part *Dao* and the lower part *De*. But *Dao* and *De* are inseparable, and so I retain the original title.

**Chapter One**
*Dao* that can be spoken of is not the Eternal *Dao*;
A name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.
The vulgar speak of *Dao* as a subtle essence,
Indescribable, beyond all naming.
But the *Laozi* holds this otherwise:
*Dao* can indeed be spoken of—
Yet it is not the *Dao* that common folk speak of.
A name can indeed be given—
Yet it is not the Name that common folk give.
What common folk call *Dao* is but a fixation on things;
What they call a Name is but a rigid, entangling distinction.
The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all forms,
Yet their origin must lie in the Formless—
Hence the Nameless is called their beginning.
All things arise through form,
Yet their creation must depend on the Formed—
Hence the Named is called their mother.

The Formless is ever-present,
To behold its wonders.
The Formed is ever-present,
To grasp its limits.
*Limits* (徼) refers to boundaries.
Once things are Formed, the Formless seems to have no use.
Yet the Sage retains the Formless without abandoning it,
To exhaust the subtleties of divine transformation.
If the Formless is so precious,
Then the Formed seems to have no use.
Yet the Sage retains the Formed without abandoning it,
To establish the boundaries of all affairs.
If one were to discard the Formed and cling only to the Formless,
It would drift and scatter, lacking all boundaries—
Thus the Formed is advantageous, the Formless is instrumental.
These two are of the same origin but different names,
Both called *Xuan* (玄).
*Xuan* again, *Xuan*—
The gateway to all wonders.
*Xuan* is neither Formed nor Formless,
The ultimate subtlety.

**Chapter Two**
All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—
Then it is no longer beauty;
All know goodness as goodness—
Then it is no longer goodness.
Beauty and goodness have paths,
Known by all—
Yet they are not the utmost of beauty and goodness.
Thus the Formless and the Formed give rise to each other,
The difficult and the easy complete one another,
The long and the short define each other,
The high and the low complement each other,
The sounds and the voices harmonize,
The before and the after follow in sequence.
All things that have traces and forms
Must necessarily be unequal.
Unequal, they contend;
Contend, they fall into disorder;
Disorder, they reach exhaustion—
Hence the Sage does not value them.

Therefore the Sage acts in non-doing,
And employs wisdom as Yu (禹) directed the waters—
Moving where there is no obstruction.
He teaches without speaking;
His person is upright—
And without commands, things are done.
All things arise, yet he does not claim them;
His mind issues forth—
Yet things may not yet respond.
When things arrive, he responds—
Without refusal or rejection.
He gives birth yet does not possess,
Nurturing all things without appropriating them for himself.
He acts yet does not rely upon it,
For the Sage cannot fully refrain from action under Heaven—
Yet he does not depend on it as his own strength.
When his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.
He does not boast—
Thus none contend with him for ability;
He does not claim credit—
Thus none contend with him for achievement.

**Chapter Three**
Do not exalt the virtuous—
So the people will not contend.
Yet the virtuous cannot be ignored—
All know this.
But when its excesses are considered,
Contention for reputation brings only disorder—
Thus the *Laozi* corrects this, urging people to value substance over name.

Do not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth—
So the people will not become thieves.
Do not display what is desirable—
So the heart will not be disturbed.
Therefore the Sage’s governance:
Empties their desires—
So the people have no cravings for gain.
Fills their bellies—
So they have enough to eat.
Weakens their ambitions—
So they dare not contend or seize.
Strengthens their bones—
So they labor with vigor.
Ever keeps the people in ignorance and free from desire,
Content with their food, pleased with their garments—
Unaware of anything beyond their needs.
Thus even the wise dare not act.
None respond to him.
If he acts in non-doing,
Nothing remains ungoverned.
If he governs them to reach non-doing—
This is his way.

**Chapter Four**
The *Dao* is vast yet used, yet never full;
Deep as the ancestral source of all things.
Fathomless, it is ever the master of things.
It blunts their sharpness—
For the *Dao* abhors exposed ferocity.
It unravels their entanglements—
For the *Dao* despises chaotic affairs.
It subdues their brilliance—
For the *Dao* deems resplendent display contemptible.
It aligns with their dust—
For the *Dao* values the humble and defiled.
Serene, it seems as if it exists—
Yet serene and unmoving, it appears both present and absent.
I do not know whose child it is—
Yet it precedes the Emperor.
This speaks of its birth before Heaven and Earth,
None can rival its antiquity.

**Chapter Five**
Heaven and Earth are not kind,
Yet they treat all things as sacrificial straw-dogs;
Straw-dogs are ritual implements—
Valued before use, discarded after.
Heaven produces the five *qi* (村),
Yet its power is exhausted and flawed—
This resembles unkindness.
The Sage is not kind,
Yet he treats the people as sacrificial straw-dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like the *tuqiao* (橐钥)?
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever producing more.
*Tu* (橐) means to thrust aside;
*Qiao* (钥) means the *yuelü* (乐钥) instrument.
Within the *tuqiao* lies a hollow, boundless space—
Thus it is empty and cannot be exhausted or bent;
Thus it moves and cannot be drained.

Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to hold fast to the center.
If one truly holds to the center,
Silence itself will be believed.

**Chapter Six**
The *qi* of the Valley does not die—
The center is hollow, hence called *Valley* (谷);
Fathomless, hence called *Divine* (神).
Heaven and Earth have limits,
Yet the *Dao* is limitless—
Hence it is said to not die.
This is called the *Xuan* Mother.

**Chapter Seven**
The *Xuan* is subtle—
Its marvel lies in its profundity.
The *Pìn* is the mother of all things.
The *Xuan Pìn* Gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Through it, Heaven and Earth give birth.
Endless as silk,
Yet never exhausted in use.
Faint yet unbroken,
Now absent, now present—
Nothing is unused,
Yet never labored.

**Chapter Eight**
The highest virtue resembles water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend;
It dwells where others abhor—
For people despise the lowly.
Thus it approaches the *Dao*.
The *Dao* has no equal to water,
Hence it is said to approach it.
To dwell is to occupy the low ground,
To be mindful is to be deep,
To give is to be kind,
To speak is to be trustworthy,
To govern is to purify,
To act is to fulfill,
To manage is to adapt to round and square,
To move is to be timely—
Solidifying when still, floating when stirred.
Only by not contending
Is there no blame.
Contention is the end of all things.
If one does not vie with others,
None will resent or hate them—
What fault could there be?
Thus it is especially praised.

**Chapter Nine**
To rely on fullness is not as good as stopping in time;
To rely on power, rank, talent, or virtue and become arrogant
Is not as good as having none.
To probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.
To probe the nature of things and sharpen one’s demands
Will inevitably lead to loss.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can guard them;
Wealth and honor bring arrogance,
And one invites their own ruin.
When the work is done and the name is complete,
Withdraw—
This is the *Dao* of Heaven.
The four seasons cycle endlessly;
When the work is complete, it moves on.

**Chapter Ten**
Nurturing the *yíngpò* (魄) and embracing the One—
Can one remain undivided?
Focusing the *qi* to attain softness—
Can one be like an infant?
Purifying and gazing into the depths—
Can one be without blemish?
Loving the people and governing the state—
Can one act without doing?
Those who love the people well
Let them live freely, guiding without harming.
Those who govern the state well
Trust in their capacities, achieving without labor.
Opening and closing the Heavenly Gate—
Can one be receptive as the female?
Illuminating and all-pervading—
Can one be without knowing?
With wisdom and insight,
Guard with simplicity.
To give birth and nurture—
To give birth without possessing,
To act without relying,
To grow without dominating—
This is called *Xuan* virtue.
*Cháng* means to know what is beneath;
*Zǎi* means to control and cut.

「Thirty spokes converge at one hub—
When there is nothing there, the use of the wheel is realized;
Its hollowness within receives all things,
Thus it can govern the multitude with the few.
Clay is shaped into vessels—
When there is nothing there, the use of the vessels is realized;
*Bī* is harmony, *zhí* is earth.
Piercing doors and windows to make a room—
When there is nothing there, the use of the room is realized.
Thus, having is for utility,
But nothingness is for function.

*Lǐ* reaches to the point of no form,
Music reaches to the point of no sound,
Law reaches to the point of no punishment,
Then the Dao’s function is revealed.

**Chapter Twelve**

The five colors blind the eyes,
The five tones deaf the ears,
The five flavors dull the palate;
*Shuāng* is loss.
Galloping hunts and wild chases drive the heart mad,
Rare treasures cause erratic conduct.
All these harm the inner from the outer.
Thus the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes,
And so discards the former to embrace the latter.
The belly guards the inner,
The eyes covet the outer.

**Chapter Thirteen**

Favor and disgrace are like sudden alarms,
Great calamities are like personal threats.
What is meant by "favor and disgrace are like sudden alarms"?
Favor is lowly—
Gaining it is like alarm,
Losing it is like alarm;
This is called "favor and disgrace are like sudden alarms."
For the *shì* (gentleman/scholar),
*Dao* and *virtue* are held above,
Titles and rewards below.
The upper brings honor,
The lower brings humiliation.
The common people thus cling to their disgrace,
And when they lose it, they tremble;
When they gain it, they weep.

What is meant by "great calamities are like personal threats"?
My great calamity comes from my having a body.
Because I have this body,
When I am without a body,
I return to nature.
What calamity do I have then?
Color, sound, flavor, and rare treasures—
These are the great calamities of the body.
The common people thus blame them more than their own bodies,
For they pursue the outer and forget the inner.

Thus, the Sage who unifies through yielding
Can entrust himself with the world;
The Sage who loves the world with himself
Can be entrusted with the world.
He who is entrusted with the world,
The world also entrusts him with great value.
He who loves and benefits the world,
The world also loves and benefits him.
*Jīn* (gold), *wèi* (silk), *xù* (jewelry), and *huái* (rare goods)—
These cheapen and destroy the world,
Yet the world holds them in high regard.
Thus the Sage’s love and regard for the world
Are the same as his love and regard for himself—
So entrusted with great responsibility,
He is certain to uphold it.

**Chapter Fourteen**
Gazing without naming is called *yí* (equanimity/evenness).」

**Chapter Fifteen**
To see without naming is called *yí*—formless.
To hear without naming is called *xī*—voiceless.
To grasp without obtaining is called *wēi*—formless.
These three states—
They cannot be defined in words, so they merge into one,
All returning to *wú* (nothingness).
The highest of them is not bright,
The lowest is not dark.
Brightness is clarity.
The Dao ascends like fine sand, giving birth to all things yet unseen.
The Dao descends, causing all things to rest yet never perishing.
It is *shéngshéng*—endless yet nameless.
*Shéngshéng*, the appearance of boundless extension,
Is called "having" or "having not"—
Both are forced names.
Returning again to the formless.
This is called the *zhuàng* (form) of no form,
The *xiàng* (image) of no thing.
If one speaks of nothingness without error,
Then all things arise from it.
If one speaks of existence without error,
Then one does not see its shape.
The image of no thing is called *hūhuǎng*—
Sometimes appearing, sometimes not.
Approach it, and one does not see its beginning;
Examine it, and one does not see its end.
Hold fast to the Dao of antiquity
To govern the existence of the present.
The Dao of antiquity is *wú* (nothingness).
To know the beginning of antiquity is called *dàojì*—
The Dao is measured by nothingness.

**Chapter Sixteen**
The ancients who excelled in *shì* (official service/conduct)
Were subtle, mysterious, and profound—
Deep beyond comprehension.
Because they were incomprehensible,
Their actions were forced to appear in outward forms:
Only their external appearances were acceptable.
Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,
Wary as if fearing four neighbors,
Solemn as a guest,
Dissolving like ice about to melt,
Thick as uncarved wood,
Vast as a valley,
Mixed as if standing alone.
All these were the outward forms of those who had the Dao.
Who could muddy and then slowly clarify?
Who could settle and then endure, slowly growing?
Those who preserve this Dao
Do not wish to overflow.
Because they do not overflow,
They can be exhausted yet renewed again.
Virtue comes from humility.

**Chapter Seventeen**

**Chapter Seventeen**
When the utmost emptiness is attained,
And steadfast stillness is preserved—
All things rise together, and I observe their return.
All movement of things
Must inevitably return to stillness.
The myriad things, teeming and diverse,
Each return to their root.
Things arise from the formless,
And return to the formless.
Returning to the root is called stillness;
Stillness, when divided, is called *fùmíng* (restoration of vital order).
When things are still, they follow the *tiānming* (Heaven’s decree).
Restoration of *míng* (vital order) is called constancy.
Who can defy Heaven?
Knowing constancy is called clarity.
Neither movement nor stillness loses its proper time.
Ignorant of constancy, reckless action brings ruin.
To act contrary to principle.
Knowing constancy is called tolerance;
Emptiness and stillness embrace all without exclusion.
Tolerance is impartiality—
No favoritism, no partiality.
Impartiality is sovereign—
All under Heaven turn toward it.
Sovereignty is Heaven—
Aligning with Heaven’s *dé* (virtue/power).
Heaven is the Dao—
Heaven follows the Dao.
The Dao endures eternally—
Boundless.
Death does not bring peril.
In emptiness, there is no resistance;
In stillness, no invasion—
What danger could there be?

**Chapter Eighteen**
The Sage of Highest Virtue
Is known to the lower ranks as if he existed,
Yet none know his imperial power.
The next kind
Is cherished and praised—
Yet leaves traces.
The next kind
Is feared—
Forced submission through coercion.
The next kind
Is scorned.
Both威 (*wēi*, coercive power) and 德 (*dé*, virtue/power) are lost.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
Even more so, words must be honored.
Even more so, actions must be sincere.
To exhaustively fulfill one’s words
Is impossible to achieve completely.
When the work is done and the task accomplished,
The people say, *“It was as if by nature.”*
The sun rises, and they labor;
The sun sets, and they rest.
They drink from dug wells,
Eat from tilled fields.

**Chapter Nineteen**
When the Dao is abandoned,
Ren and *yì* (righteous conduct) arise;
The Daoist embodies *rén* and *yì* as essence,
Practices them with sincerity,
Yet does not display them outwardly.
Thus, when the Dao is practiced,
*Rén* and *yì* are concealed;
When the Dao is abandoned,
*Rén* and *yì* become prominent.
Wisdom and insight emerge,
And great deceit follows;
The petty rely on goodness to do evil.
Family bonds fracture, yet filial piety arises;
The state falls into chaos, yet loyal ministers appear.
Family bonds—father, son, brothers, husband, wife.
If family bonds are naturally harmonious,
And the state naturally governed,
Then filial piety, loyalty, and ministers
Are unknown in their proper place.
Fish cannot forget one another in rivers and lakes,
And thus the virtue of mutual nourishment arises.

**Chapter Twenty**
Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—
The people benefit a hundredfold.
Sages and wisdom were meant to benefit the people,
But in their later corruption,
They are sometimes used to harm them—
Thus Laozi corrects this.
Abandon *rén* and *yì*—
The people return to filial piety.
Filial piety is the root of *rén* and *yì*.
Abandon artifice, discard profit—
Thieves and robbers vanish.
Skill in benefiting the people is the original intent of sages and wisdom.
Thieves and robbers merely steal skill for selfish gain.
These three—
Though used for ornamentation, they are insufficient—
Thus they must be anchored.
*Shǔ* (anchor/establish).
Sages, wisdom, *rén*, *yì*, skill, and profit—
All were ancient virtuous paths,
But later generations used them merely for show,
Their inner sincerity lacking—
Thus these three become mere names, losing their substance.
Seeing the unadorned,
Trusting in authenticity.

Embrace simplicity, preserve the root.
Fewer private desires, no self.
Few desires, no demands.

In twenty chapters, abandon learning to be free from care.
The reason learning cannot be abandoned is to seek the Dao.
If one abandons the root and pursues the superficial, laboring without fruit,
It is better not to learn at all than to labor without gain.

The difference between "yes" and "ah" is slight—
The difference between good and evil, how great?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
To assent is to be respectful; to agree passively is to be arrogant.
To those who follow the Way, assent and passive agreement, good and evil,
All converge in nothingness, their differences negligible.

Yet respect brings joy, arrogance invites anger,
Good invites blessing, evil invites calamity—
Anger summons disaster, threatening one’s very life—
Thus one must fear it.

All do it, how dare I not?
Vast and boundless, this Way!

Respect and goodness are mere trifling deeds,
Sufficient only to avoid harm,
Yet insufficient as the Great Dao.

The Great Dao is vast and boundless, immeasurable.
The masses rejoice as if feasting on grand sacrifices,
As if ascending Spring Terrace—
Taking delight in external things.

I alone am fearful, as yet unmanifest,
Like an infant before laughter.
*Kids*—the sound of a child’s laughter—
Wandering, as if without destination.

The masses all have excess, striving for more,
While I alone seem abandoned, possessing nothing.
Ah, the heart of the foolish one!
Pure and unadulterated.

The vulgar are bright and sharp,
While I alone seem dim.
The vulgar are keen and discerning,
While I alone am muddled.
Faint and obscure, drifting without end,
The masses all conform,
While I alone seem stubborn and coarse.

I alone differ from others,
Valuing the nourishing Mother.
Nursed by the Original Unity,
The *Moral and Daoist Classic* concludes here.
—Commentary by the Sima family.

**Chapter 21**
The bearing of supreme virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
Vague and indistinct.
Indistinct and vague,
Yet within it are forms.
Vague and indistinct,
Yet within it are things.
Profound and dark,
Yet within it is essence—
Its essence most true,
Yet within it is veracity.
Veracity is confirmation—
All called the "formless form."
From ancient times to now,
Its name has never faded,
To observe the myriad things.

How do I know the myriad things are thus?
By this.

**Chapter 22**
Bent, yet whole.
Rigid and straight, it breaks itself.
Crooked, yet straight—
Though paths are winding,
They lead to the Central States.
Though rivers curve,
They flow to the sea.
Hollow, yet full—
Water fills the depths,
Trees shed their branches,
Mountains lose their bulk,
Marshes grow fat.
Worn, yet renewed—
Silk brocade still bears its weight.
Few, yet gain;
Many, yet confused.
Thus, the Sage embraces Unity as the model for all under Heaven.
Unity—
The extreme of fewness.
Not self-illuminating, yet clear;
Timely, yet ever manifest.
Not self-righteous, yet renowned;
Consulting the masses, abandoning self to follow others.
Not self-praising, yet achieving;
Not self-exalting, yet enduring.
Function and fame last eternally.
Only by not contending
Does one under Heaven find none to contend with.
Was it not said of old:
*"Bent, yet whole"*—
Was this mere empty speech?
Truly whole, returning to it,
One’s life remains unharmed.

**Chapter 23**
Few words, natural.
Those who know the Dao speak not yet make clear—
Thus, it is called *natural*.
A gusting wind does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—
How much less so a man?
The restless multiply words,
Yet cannot abide firmly in the Dao.
Thus, those who practice the Dao
Align with the Dao, virtue aligns with virtue,
Loss aligns with loss—
All self-attained.
Align with the Dao, the Dao attains it;
Align with virtue, virtue attains it;
Align with loss, loss attains it.
Natural correspondence.
Untrustworthy words breed distrust—
From their valuing speech.

**Chapter 24**
The limping cannot stand,
The striding cannot walk.
The heart has its attachment,
Thus cannot hold two things.
Self-illuminating, yet unclear;
Self-righteous, yet not renowned;
Self-praising, yet no achievement;
Self-exalting, yet no endurance.
All vie externally while perishing within.
As for the Dao,
It is "excess food, superfluous limbs."
Some may hate it,
Thus those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.
Though the foundation is beautiful,
Excess may yet defile it.
Though the foundation has merit,
Self-praise becomes a blemish.
Some may hate it—
As if struck by it.

**Chapter 25**
There is a thing, mixed and complete,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Mixed and self-formed.
Silent and vast,
Standing alone yet unchanging—
No match, thus called *independent*.
Its transformations never lose their constancy—
Thus called *unchanging*.
Circulating endlessly without peril—
Circulating, reaching everywhere without danger.
It can be the Mother of Heaven and Earth,
Giving birth to great form.
I do not know its name—
Names fix forms,
Yet it is formless, beyond fixing.
Call it the Dao—
Taking from "nothing that does not pass through it."
Forcefully name it *Great*.
Great is *passing*,
Passing is *distant*,
Distant is *returning*.
Thus, the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
The King is Great.
Within the realm are four Greats,
And the King occupies one of them.
A wise ruler does not use his position to boast.
Man follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *naturalness*.

**Chapter 26**
Weight is the root of light,
Stillness is the master of restlessness.
Thus, the virtuous man, though traveling all day,
Never strays from his baggage.
He guards weight and stillness as his foundation.
Though adorned with splendor,
He dwells serenely above it,
Unmoved by it.
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lightly bear the world?
Lightness loses ministers,
Restlessness loses subjects.
The ruler light and restless—
His ministers do not fear him.
The ministers light and restless—
The ruler despises them.

**Chapter 27**
The skilled traveler leaves no tracks,
The skilled speaker leaves no flaws,
The skilled planner needs no calculations—
Knowing it must be so.
The skilled closer needs no bolts yet cannot be opened,
The fortified state does not rely on mountain passes.
The skilled binder needs no cords yet cannot be untied,
The governed people do not rely on borders.
Thus, the Sage always rescues people,
So none are abandoned;
Always rescues things,
So none are discarded.
This is called *borrowing clarity*.
Thus, the good man is the teacher of the ungood,
The ungood man is the resource of the good.
Not honoring one’s teacher,
Not cherishing one’s resource—
Though wise, one is greatly confused.
This is called *the subtle mystery*.

**Chapter 28**
Know the male,
Hold to the female,
Possess martial strength yet do not use it.

For the sake of the world, be a valley.
Dwell in lowliness, yet be the refuge of all.
For the sake of the world, preserve virtue without separation,
Returning to the state of the infant.
Through virtue, return to the Way.

Know the bright, hold to the dark,
The bright is pure and clear, the dark is turbid and foul.
For the sake of the world, set the standard.

For the sake of the world, set the standard,
Preserve virtue without force,
Returning to the state of the Uncarved.
Know honor, hold to disgrace—
For the sake of the world, be a valley.
For the sake of the world, be a valley,
Preserve virtue and it shall be sufficient,
Returning to the Uncarved.
The Uncarved scatters to become vessels;
The Sage uses it to become officials and leaders.
When talents are displayed outwardly, they are like vessels,
Each with its own function.
The Sage employs them according to their abilities,
Making them leaders of the multitude.
Thus, great governance does not cut—
It follows their natural course.

**Chapter 29**
Those who would take the world by force,
I see they will not succeed.
The world is a sacred vessel—
It cannot be forced.
Forcing it brings ruin,
Seizing it brings loss.
Forcing it harms nature,
Seizing it disrupts adaptability.
Thus, things sometimes move, sometimes follow,
Sometimes are molded, sometimes blown,
Sometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes rise, sometimes fall.
Rise is completion—
These are all the natural tendencies of things.
Therefore, the Sage avoids extremes,
Avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance.
He lets things follow their nature,
Removing only these three things.

**Chapter 30**
Those who assist the ruler with the Dao
Do not use force to dominate the world—
Their work is easily undone.
Things pushed to extremes reverse—
Hence, it is said: "Good returns."
Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies, there are years of famine.
War is a cruel instrument.
Thus, the skilled warrior achieves his end
And does not dare to take pride in it.
Achievement is completion—
When the task is done, cease.
Achieve without boasting,
Achieve without arrogance,
Achieve without self-praise,
Achieve without compulsion—
This is to achieve without force.
When things are at their peak, they grow old—
This is called un-Dao,
And un-Dao ends early.
The proud and forceful do not endure long.

---

**Chapter 31**
A fine army is an ominous instrument—
The better the army, the more harm it brings.
Things may be hated for this reason,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not employ it.
The noble one at home values the left,
In war, values the right.
Army, an ominous instrument,
Not the noble one’s tool—
When forced to use it, let tranquility be supreme.
To win yet not rejoice,
If one rejoices in victory, it is because they delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing
Cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.
Hence, auspicious matters favor the left,
Ominous matters favor the right.
The left commander, the right commander—
This is spoken of in terms of funeral rites.
When many are slain, let tears of sorrow flow,
When victory is won, let it be treated with funeral rites.
This is the saying of war’s ominous nature.

**Chapter 32**
The Dao is ever nameless,
Unfathomable and unpointed.
Though crude, it is small,
Yet the crude is the Dao’s essence.
The world dares not serve it—
This speaks of its reverence.
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would come of their own accord.
Heaven and Earth unite,
And sweet dew descends—
The people do not command it, yet it is evenly distributed.
If lords and kings guard the Dao,
Then things submit, the *qi* harmonizes, and the people transform.
At first, it had no name,
Yet the Sage who attained the Dao
Must establish and apply it—
They cannot remain without speech.
Names are thus given.
Though they use named measures to teach the people,
They still strive for simplicity and moderation,
Lest they let excess flourish.
The Dao’s presence in the world
Is like rivers and valleys to the sea.
The teachings of deliberate action,
Compared to the Dao, differ greatly in scale,
Yet they all ultimately return to the Dao.

**Chapter 33**
To know others is wisdom,
To know oneself is enlightenment.
To overcome others is strength,
To overcome oneself is power.
To overcome oneself is most difficult.
To know contentment is wealth—
Ever content.
To act with resolve is to have ambition.
To never lose one’s place is longevity—
To find one’s place is security.
To die yet not perish is true longevity—
The body may be gone, but the Dao remains.

**Chapter 34**
The Great Dao flows broadly,
Left and right it cannot be confined—
This is to say, no fixation.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it does not refuse them,
It gives to all.
Achievement is complete yet unclaimed,
Clothing all things yet not lording over them.
Thus, it ever lacks desire—
This can be called *small* indeed;
Easily content.
All things return to it,
Yet it knows no master—
This can be called *great* indeed.
Therefore, the Sage never claims to be great,
And thus can achieve true greatness.

**Chapter 35**
Grasp the great image,
And the world will turn toward you.
The Dao’s manifestation is called the *image*—
The Sage holds it,
And rules the world.
They turn toward you yet suffer no harm,
And find peace, security, and tranquility.
Do not use deliberate action to harm them.

**Chapter 36**
Delight and bait—travelers pause.
The multitude is fixated on things.
When the Dao issues forth in speech,
Its flavor is faint, insipid.
To gaze upon it, insufficient to see;
To listen, insufficient to hear—
Unlike delight and bait.
To use it cannot be like baiting.
Empty yet unyielding.

**Chapter 37**
When you would contract it, first expand it;
When you would weaken it, first strengthen it;
When you would abandon it, first exalt it;
When you would take it, first give it.
This is called *subtle luminosity*.
To know the luminosity of subtlety—
Softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.
Fish cannot escape the depths;
The state’s sharpest tools
Should not be displayed to the people.

**Chapter 38**
The Dao acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could guard it,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation is about to arise,
It is called *action*.
I shall govern it with the uncarved simplicity of the Nameless.
The uncarved simplicity of the Nameless
Will also desire nothing—
*Comprehensive forgetting*.
Without desire, in stillness,
The world will self-correct.

*The Classic of Virtue and the Dao, Volume II concludes.
The Classic of Virtue and the Dao, Volume III begins.*

**Commentary by Sima [Shi] on Chapter 38**
The highest virtue does not claim virtue,
And so it has virtue.
It pursues sincerity and acts accordingly,
Yet does not consider itself virtuous.
The lowest virtue does not lose virtue,
And so it has no virtue.
It covets the name of virtue,
And follows its outward display to seek it.
The highest virtue acts without doing,
Yet nothing remains undone.
I act without doing for the people,
And they transform of their own accord.
“Without doing” means not to rely on contrived action.
The lowest virtue acts with contrived doing,
And so it relies on contrived action.
Virtue that relies on contrived action
Will decay if not constantly maintained.
The highest benevolence acts without contriving,
Yet benefits the people according to their needs.
The highest righteousness acts with contriving,
And so it enforces rules upon them.
The highest propriety acts with contriving,
Yet the people do not respond,
So it forces them with arms and threats.
It establishes institutions to compel the people,
But when the people refuse to comply,
It uses punishment to intimidate them.
*仍* means to draw or pull; it may also be written as *扔*.
Thus, when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
When the Way is lost, virtue follows.
The Way is formless; virtue leaves no trace.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
Fish bask in the warmth, yet they cannot be held.
When righteousness is lost, propriety follows;
Favor cannot be retained, so rules must be imposed.
When propriety is lost, the people are confused.
It only governs their outward appearance.
Indeed, propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of disorder.
Loyalty and trust are the foundation of propriety.
If one guards its form while forgetting its foundation,
Cunning and deceit will flourish.
Preconceived knowledge is the ornament of the Way,
And the origin of folly.
In the world, there are those who measure a billion degrees yet always miss the mark;
People may call them wise,
But they are often spoken of as exhausted by calculation,
And still they cannot escape folly.
Therefore, the true man dwells in its substance, not in its ornament,
And takes what is genuine, not what is superficial.
So he discards that and embraces this.

**Chapter 39**
Of old, those who attained the One:
The heavens attained the One and became clear,
The earth attained the One and became tranquil,
The spirit attained the One and became agile,
The grain attained the One and became abundant,
All things attained the One and came to life,
And lords and kings attained the One to govern the world.
Their attainment was all the same.
The One is the offspring of the Dao,
And the progenitor of all things,
So all things rely on it to succeed.
Speaking in terms of affairs,
The One is the enduring and unceasing.
The heavens, without the One to make them clear, would fear collapse,
The earth, without the One to make it tranquil, would fear upheaval,
The spirit, without the One to make it agile, would fear exhaustion,
The grain, without the One to make it abundant, would fear depletion,
All things, without the One to make them live, would fear annihilation,
And lords and kings, without the One to make them noble and exalted, would fear decline.
To depart from the foundation is to lose the Dao,
And so it is not constant.
Thus, nobility must be rooted in humility,
And exaltation must be founded on lowliness.
Therefore, lords and kings call themselves lonely and impoverished,
This is their use of humility as foundation—
Is it not? They dare not forget their root.
Hence, they attain the myriad chariots yet have no chariots,

The measure of softness surpasses that of trees—
Each points to its own name, yet there are no more chariots.

Do not desire brilliance like jade,
Nor coldness like stone.

**Chapter Forty**
The Dao moves through reversal;
The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao.
The yielding is the Dao’s function.

All things under heaven arise from being,
Being arises from non-being.

**Chapter Forty—**
The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
The middle person hears the Dao and holds it as if it were fading;
The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

The Dao that is not ordinary
Is not known by ordinary people.

Thus, the ancient teachings say:
To clarify the Dao is to seem obscure,
To advance the Dao is to seem to retreat,
To smooth the Dao is to seem uneven—
*Uneven* refers to the unevenness of silk threads.

Virtue supreme is like a valley,
Great brightness is like a stain,
Ample virtue seems insufficient,
Established virtue seems stolen,
Sincerity seems perverse,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel takes longest to form,
The greatest sound is faintest in tone,
The greatest image has no form—
The Dao is hidden, nameless.

Only the Dao
Lends itself generously yet completes its work.
Things rely on it to be completed yet cannot possess it—
Thus, it is called *lending*.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Dao gives birth to the One,

「From the Non-Being to the Being.
The One gives birth to the Two,
Dividing Yin and Yang.
The Two gives birth to the Three,
Nourished by the harmonizing *zhōnghé* (中和).
The Three gives birth to the myriad things.
All things bear Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,
Bear being akin to *bèi* (背, "to turn away"),
Embrace akin to *xiàng* (向, "to face").
The clash of opposing *qi* (氣) achieves harmony.
All things lack not the substance of Yin and Yang,
Nor the function of clashing *qi*.

What people detest,
Are the solitary, the widowed, and the childless,
Yet kings and nobles prize them as *chēng* (称, "auspicious").
Thus, some things may be diminished yet gain,
Or augmented yet lose.
Fullness invites harm,
Humility invites benefit—
Both are ways to avoid excess,
And approach the harmonizing *zhōnghé*.

What people teach,
I also teach.
*I also teach* (亦我教之) means *I too teach* (亦我教之).
The overbearing perish without their due end,
I shall take them as my *jiào fù* (教父, "teachers of the multitude").
As the teacher of all.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
The supreme softness in the world,
Rides roughshod over the supreme hardness in the world—
The watercourse of Tai Mountain (泰山之溜) pierces stone.
Nothing enters where there is no gap,
Thus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (無為, non-action).
The finest of forms,
Cannot be as subtle as dust,
Yet cannot enter where there are no crevices.
Only the Non-Being
Can enter where there is no gap.

The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of non-action,
Few in the world can attain.
Knowers are rare.

**Chapter Forty-Four**」

**Chapter Forty-Five**
What is more intimate—name or body?
What is more abundant—body or wealth?
What brings greater suffering—gain or loss?
To gain name and wealth while losing one’s body,
Or to lose name and wealth while preserving one’s body—
Which brings greater suffering?

Thus, the more one clings to, the more one consumes;
The more one hoards, the more one loses.
He who knows sufficiency is not humiliated;
He who knows when to stop is not in peril.
Thus may one endure long.

The greatest fullness seems a void—
Its use is inexhaustible.
The greatest abundance seems empty—
Its use is boundless.
Things complete must decay;
Fullness must overflow—
This is the constant way of things.

The man of the Dao, though complete, seems deficient;
Though abundant, seems empty—
Thus his use is neither exhausted nor boundless.

The most straight seems bent,
The most skillful seems clumsy,
The most eloquent seems tongue-tied.

Agitation overcomes cold—
Action ensues.
Stillness overcomes heat—
Non-action prevails.
Clarity and tranquility are the rectification of the world.
In emptiness and stillness, observe all things.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
When the Dao prevails in the world,
Warhorses are turned to plow.
No striving, no contention—
Contain the external, cultivate the internal.

When the Dao does not prevail in the world,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.
Greed is insatiable—
Internal strife, external contention.
No greater crime than coveting what is desired—
The common man, though blameless, bears guilt for his treasure.
No greater calamity than insatiability,
No greater fault than desiring what one cannot have.
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Without stepping beyond the door,
Know the world.
Without peering through the window,
See the Dao of Heaven.
Obtain its root and source.
The farther one strays from the root,
The less one knows.
Chasing ends while abandoning origins—
Thus the sage acts without knowing,
Names without seeing,
Holds fast to the unchanging,
Accomplishes without doing.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
To study learning is daily increase;
To study the Dao is daily decrease.
Strip away the superficial and redundant.
Reduce, and reduce again—
Until one reaches *wuwei* (non-action).
In *wuwei*, there is nothing that cannot be done.

The limping cannot stand;
The striding cannot walk.
To act is to be obstructed in a corner—
Thus, in *wuwei*, there is nothing that cannot be done.

Therefore, he who would take the world
Must act with *wuwei*—
Let the world return to it of its own accord.
When action arises,
It is insufficient to take the world.
Force it, and things will not comply.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no fixed heart,
But takes the hearts of the people as his own.
Following the times, adapting to things,
Responding to change in accordance with the Dao.
The good, I treat as good;
The ungood, I also treat as good—
Thus goodness is attained.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Thus trust is attained.
Though they are ungood, I myself act with goodness toward them—
Their goodness is not lost.
Though they are untrustworthy, I myself uphold trust toward them—
Their trust is not lost.

The sage in the world,
Chattering ceaselessly to harmonize the hearts of the people.
Harmonizing their hearts,
He makes no distinctions.
All the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,
Taking him as model and mirror.
The sage treats them all as infants,
Loving them as his own children.

**Chapter Fifty**
To enter and exit life and death,
To emerge from the birthplace and enter the deathplace.
Thirteen are born in life,
Thirteen are born in death,
Thirteen are born into the realm of death by their own motion.
Why is this?
Because their vitality is excessive.

Of ten people, roughly three preserve their lives through gentleness and weakness,
Three hasten their deaths through rigidity and strength,
And even those who seek to cherish life cannot avoid rushing toward death—
Also three.

Those who cherish life yet rush toward death
Do so because their self-nurturing is too excessive.

It is said that the adept at preserving life
Walks on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
Enters battle without being struck by weapons—
The rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,
The tiger no place to wield its claws,
Weapons no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this?
Because there is no deathplace for him.

The rhinoceros and tiger are metaphors for brute force and violence.
To dwell among the strong and violent yet suffer no harm is because of one’s gentleness and non-contentiousness.

**Chapter 51**
The Dao gives birth to it.
The root origin, formless, is called the Dao.
Virtue nurtures it.
Qi and transformations manifest as virtue.
Things take form,
Gathering to become material, their essences diverse yet scattered.
Momentum completes it—
Life must grow, growth must mature, by the natural order.
Thus, all things reverence the Dao and hold virtue dear,
Honoring it as parent and child.
The Dao’s exalted nature, virtue’s noble worth—
None bestow these titles, yet they abide eternally natural.
The sage harmonizes virtue and the Dao across the world,
And thus is revered by all.
Therefore, the Dao gives birth and nurtures,
Grows and fosters, completes and matures,
Nourishes and shelters.
When its work is done, all returns to the Dao.
To give birth yet not possess,
To act yet not rely,
To grow yet not dominate—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

**Chapter 52**
The world has a beginning,
Which becomes the mother of the world.
This beginning is the Dao,
The Dao being the source from which all things arise.
Having found its mother,
One knows its children.
Establishing rites, music, punishments, and governance from the Dao,
Having known its children,
One must return to guard its mother—
Thus, one’s life remains unharmed.
Do not forget the root, abandon the Dao.
Seal its openings,
Close its gates,
And one’s life will never labor.
Open its openings,
Advance its affairs,
And one’s life will never be saved.
Seeing the small as clarity,
Holding to gentleness as strength.
Using its radiance,
Returning to its clarity—
No calamity befalls the body—
This is called following the constant.
Radiance shines outward,
Clarity illuminates within.

**Chapter 53**
If I were to have clear awareness,
Walking the Great Dao,
Only reverence would guide me.
The Great Dao is most smooth,
Yet people love shortcuts.
The Dao is inherently simple and easy,
But because people prefer to carve their own paths,
They lose the Dao.
Morning halls are swept clean,
Fields lie fallow,
Granaries stand empty.
In a land that has lost the Dao,
They scrutinize what is near while neglecting what is far,
Chase trivialities while forgetting the root—
Thus, though their halls appear orderly,
Their people are truly impoverished.
Wearing ornate robes,
Bearing sharp swords,
Gluttonous in food and drink,
Hoarding wealth—
This is called thievish vanity.
Taking what is not one’s own is called theft.
When virtue is shallow yet rank is high,
When wisdom is small yet schemes are grand,
Danger and ruin are imminent.
Yet they do not realize it,
And instead grow arrogant,
Believing themselves to be—
When they are pleased with their gains,
Their fine attire is unsuited,
Their stored wealth is insatiable—
Thus, it is called thievish vanity.
Thievish vanity—
How can this be the Dao?
Why do such vanities arise?
Is it not because they originally sought the Dao,
Yet carved their own paths and thus lost it?

**Chapter 54**
The adept at establishing—
Cannot be uprooted.

Deep-rooted and firmly anchored,
It cannot be moved or shaken.
The adept at embracing—
Does not grow weary,
For the people’s hearts are in harmony,
Unshakable, untaken.
Their descendants’ sacrifices
Do not falter at the door,
Their blessings endure long.

Cultivate it in the self—
Its virtue becomes true.
Cultivate it in the family—
Its virtue becomes abundant.
*Abundant* should read *lent*.
Cultivate it in the village—
Its virtue becomes enduring.
Cultivate it in the state—
Its virtue becomes plentiful.
Cultivate it in the world—
Its virtue becomes universal.

All follow the root to govern the branches,
From near to far.
Thus, observe the self to know the self,
Observe the family to know the family,
Observe the village to know the village,
Observe the state to know the state—
As one.
Observe the world to know the world.
Compare the past to the present.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.
From one, know ten thousand.

Those rich in contained virtue
Are like the infant.
Poisonous creatures do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Hawks do not snatch.
Words of utmost harmony
Even the cruel cannot bear to harm.
Bones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm—
Unknowing of male and female union, yet erect—
The essence is supreme.
Cries all day yet voice does not grow hoarse—
Harmony is supreme.
All lies in its naturalness.
Know harmony as constant,
Know constancy as clarity.
To nurture life is auspicious—
Auspicious is good.
The goodness of harmony
Can nurture life.
Let the heart command the *qi*—this is strength.
The will governs the *qi*;
The heart moves, the *qi* becomes disordered,
The *qi* disordered, the mind grows dim,
The heart cannot control—
Thus arise perverse and violent deeds.
Common folk deem those with abundant *qi* as strong,
But Laozi alone deems those whose heart commands the *qi* as strong.
When things are at their peak, they age—
This is called *not-Dao*,
And *not-Dao* perishes early.
Not using one’s peak strength
Can avert premature ruin.

The wise do not speak,
For they hold it within.
Those who speak do not know—
They seek it without.
Seal the senses,
Close the gates,
No coming or going.
Dull the sharp,
Untangle the tangled,
Harmonize the brilliance,
Blend with the dust—
This is called *Mysterious Unity*.
The Mysterious is supremely deep,
The firm has no outside.
Thus, it cannot be approached or distanced,
Cannot be used for gain or harm,
Cannot be honored or debased—
Guarding the Dao, it does not move.
Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.

Govern with rectitude—
Government is rectitude.
Use the unusual in warfare—
The martial arts value deceit.
Conquer the world without strife.
How do I know this is so?
The world abounds in taboos,
Yet the people grow poorer.
The people multiply sharp tools,
And the state grows more corrupt.
The people rely on cleverness,
And strange things proliferate.
Laws multiply, yet thieves abound.
Laws breed deceit.
Thus, the Sage says:
*I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;
I take no action, yet the people grow rich;
I remain at ease, yet do not disturb.
I love stillness, yet the people align themselves;
I correct myself, and all things correct themselves.
I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.
Even rewards cannot make them steal.*

When governance is dim,
The people are pure.
Hold to the essentials alone.
When governance is sharp,
The people grow weary.
Harsh laws leave no one unblemished.
Disaster, oh disaster—
Fortune’s shadow looms.
Fortune, oh fortune—
Disaster’s seed lies hidden.
Who knows their limits?
Is there no rectitude?
Disaster within fortune,
Fortune within disaster—
The world has no pure disaster, no pure fortune.
Rectitude becomes the unusual,
Goodness becomes the bizarre.
Not only disaster and fortune invert thus—
Evil and rectitude, good and bad
Also constantly reverse,
All by the principle that extremes invert.
The people’s confusion
Has lasted long indeed.
None in the world comprehend it.
Thus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,
Sharp yet not harsh,
*Year*—to scrape.
Straight yet not domineering,
Brilliant yet not dazzling—
None desire to reach extremes.

---

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality.**
*Cultivate the spirit of frugality.*
For only through frugality
Does one return early.
Returning early is called *accumulating virtue*—
Not distant, yet returning,
Not estranged from virtue,
One may thus refine oneself.
*Accumulate virtue* and nothing shall you fail to overcome.
*Diligently uphold virtue* and even the ordinary may rival the noble.
If nothing fails you, none shall know your limits—
*Universal efficacy*.
If none know your limits, you may have a realm.
Then you may safeguard your realm.
The *root* of having a realm,
May endure long.
*The root* refers to *nurturing the spirit and cultivating virtue*.
This is called the *Dao/Way of deep-rooted stability and enduring longevity*.

**Chapter 60: Governing Great Realms, Like Poaching Small Fish.**
Disturb them and they spoil.
*Advancing with the Dao* into the world,
Their *ghosts* shall not be *mysterious*.
Things each find their place—
No *portents* or calamities.
Not that their *ghosts* are not *mysterious*—
Their *mysteriousness* does not harm people;
Cold and heat, wind and rain—
Transforming, giving birth.
Not that their *mysteriousness* does not harm people—
The Sage also does not harm people.
The Sage *harmonizes* with *ghosts* and *spirits* in their auspicious and inauspicious.
Since both do not harm each other,
Virtue *intermingles* and returns.
The people are the *master* of the *spirit*—
If the Sage does not harm people,
Then the *spirit* shall not harm either.

**Chapter 60: Great Realms Flow Downward.**
They are the *confluence* of the world,
The *female* of the world.
*The confluence* is like gathering—
Great realms thus become *king* or *conqueror*,
Flowing downward like rivers and seas.
The *female* always overcomes the *male* through stillness,
Its stillness lies in its yielding.
*Explain* the *female* as virtue.
Thus, great realms yield to small realms,
And take small realms;
Small realms yield to great realms,
And take great realms.
Thus, sometimes yielding to take,
Sometimes yielding yet taken.
Taking to take from others,
Yet taken by others.
Great realms seek only to *encompass and nourish* people,
Small realms seek only to *enter and serve* others.
Both gain what they desire,
Thus the great should properly yield.

Those who *revere Heaven* safeguard their realm,
Those who *delight in Heaven* safeguard the world.

**Chapter 61: The Dao/Way, the Mystery of All Things.**
It *permeates* all things and speaks.
The virtuous treasure it,
Guard and employ it.
The unvirtuous hold onto it,
Relying on the Dao/Way to find their ease.
*Graceful words* may be *traded*,
*Noble actions* may be *bestowed*.
*Graceful words* may teach people,
As one gains goods in trade.
*Noble actions* may make people submit,
Yet not be beneath them.

People’s unvirtue—
Why should one abandon it?
What is precious in the Dao/Way
Is its *all-encompassing tolerance* and *profound transformation*,
Like the *central* abandoning the *non-central*,
The *talented* abandoning the *untalented*—
Thus they do not become *virtuous*.
Hence, establishing the *Son of Heaven*,
Setting up the *Three Exalted Ministers*,
Establishing a *lord* to tend his people,
Setting up *assistants* to guide and protect his lord.
Though one has *jewel-arches* and *four-horse chariots* to present,
It is not as good as *sitting and advancing* this Dao/Way.
*Jewel-arches*—jewels as large as an arch.
In ancient times, gifts were presented,
And some were given precedence.
Treasures are finite,
The Dao/Way is boundless.
Why was this Dao/Way so treasured in antiquity?
Was it not because one *seeks* and *obtains* it,
And *avoids guilt* through it?
Thus, it is precious for the world.
Those who *seek* and follow the Dao/Way
Shall have no failure.
Those who *transgress* yet return to the Dao/Way
Shall have no guilt.

**Chapter 62: The Dao/Way of Non-Action.**
Do without doing,
Act without acting,
Taste without tasting.
Great or small, many or few—
Repay resentment with virtue.
View the small as great,
View the few as many—
Offend yet do not retaliate.
Plan the difficult in its ease,
Achieve the great in its smallness.
The world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,
The world’s great tasks must begin in smallness.
Thus, the Sage never seeks to do great,
And so may complete the great.
Diligent and earnest,
A thousand concerns arise each day—
Thus may one govern without doing.

Light promises bring little trust—
Hence *Zilu* made no idle vows.
Much ease brings much difficulty.
The petty begin with ease and end in difficulty.
Thus, the Sage *approaches* difficulty,
And so shall have no difficulty at all.
The noble begin with difficulty and end in ease.

**Chapter 63: The Sage’s Mastery of the Dao/Way.**
Its ease is hard to maintain,
Its unseen signs are hard to plan,
Its fragility is hard to break,
Its subtlety is hard to disperse.
Act before it exists,
Govern before chaos arises.
A tree as thick as one’s embrace,
Grows from a tiny sprout;
A nine-tiered tower,
Rises from piled earth;
A journey of a thousand *li*,
Begins beneath one’s feet.
All speak of *preventing the subtle* and *cautiously beginning*.

Those who *act* shall ruin it,
Harming *Nature*.
Those who *grasp* shall lose it,
Stagnating in things.
Thus, the Sage does without doing,
And so has no ruin—
No gain, no loss.
No grasping, no loss.
No losing, no gaining.
The people’s undertakings
Often fail when nearly complete—
*Be cautious at the end as at the beginning*,
And no ruin shall come of affairs.

Thus, the Sage desires without desiring,
Does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;
What the Sage desires,
Is what is not desired—
Thus, he does not prize rare and strange things.
*Learn without learning*,
Repairing the errors of the multitude,
To *assist* the *natural* unfolding of all things,
Yet daring not to *act*.
The multitude *overuse* their minds,
Creating *superfluous growths*—
Thus, what people should *learn*
Is to *not learn*,
To repair the multitude’s errors.
All things *give birth and grow*,
None escape *Nature*—
The Sage merely *assists* them,
Daring not to *force* anything.

**Chapter 64: The Sage’s Wisdom in Governance.**
The wise in ancient times
Did not *enlighten* the people—
They sought to *bewilder* them.
Abandon ornamentation, embrace substance,
Return to simplicity, revert to *primordial* purity.
The people’s difficulty in governance
Lies in their *excessive cleverness*—
Deceit and trickery disrupt the polity.
Thus, governing with *cleverness*,
The realm’s *bane*—
Above and below deceive each other.
Not governing with *cleverness*,
The realm’s *blessing*.
The *Way of Kings* is straight.
Knowing these two,
One may set the *model*.
Always knowing the *model*,
This is called *Mysterious Virtue*.
Knowing to use *cleverness* is not as good as not using it—
Without *profound and subtle virtue*,
Who could *assist* in this?

**Chapter 66: The Dao of the Sage’s Humility**
*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,
Opposed to things yet in perfect accord—
Thus attaining the *Great Harmony*.

All creatures demand *cleverness*,
Yet those who possess *Mysterious Virtue* alone despise it—
Though opposed to things, they align with the *Way*.

The rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
Thus the sage, desiring to lead others,
Speaks with humility;
Desiring to precede others,
Acts with deference.

Thus, though placed above, none grow weary of him,
Though placed before, none are harmed by him—
Hence the world willingly follows without tiring.

Because he does not contend,
None can contend with him.

Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain.

**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**
All under heaven say my *Way* is vast,
Yet I seem unworthy.
*Worthy* means resemblance—
My words differ from the masses.

Only because it is vast does it seem unworthy.
If it were long worthy, it would be trifling.

I have three treasures; guard and hold them:
First, *compassion*;
Second, *frugality*;
Third, *not daring to lead the world*.

*Compassion* makes one courageous—
The virtuous must be bold.
*Frugality* makes one expansive—
Moderation brings abundance.
Not daring to lead the world,
One may become the vessel’s master.

The vessel’s master is like establishing law—
The teacher of all, hence called the vessel’s master.

Now abandon *compassion* and its boldness,
Abandon *frugality* and its abundance,
Abandon deference and take precedence—
Death will follow.
You will be harmed by things.

*Compassion* in battle brings victory,
In defense brings security.
The virtuous are the people’s refuge.
Heaven aids them with *compassion* as their shield—
No one dares to harm them.

**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**
The skilled warrior is not fierce,
But subdues through *virtue*.
The skilled fighter does not rage,
Only seeks resolution.
The skilled victor does not contend—
He bends others’ arms without battle.

The skilled ruler serves below,
Winning their affection.

This is called the *virtue of non-contention*,
The *power of using people*,
The *harmony with Heaven’s ancient extreme*.

*Virtue* aligns with Heaven—
Since the birth of the people, none surpasses it.

**Chapter 69: The Art of War**
In wielding arms, one says:
I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender.
*The aggressor* means bearing strong arms as one’s duty.
*The defender* means others press upon me, and I respond unwillingly.

I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot—
Humility without blame.

This is called *action without action*—
No action yet it arrives.
*Seizing without arms*—
No arms yet can seize others.
*No enemy*—
The enemy surrenders without resistance.
*Grasping without weapons*—
No weapons yet complete victory.

No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—
Underestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.
*Treasures* mean the three treasures.

Thus, when armies clash, the compassionate prevail.
Direct speech without contention
Makes one pitied by all.

**Chapter 70: The Simplicity of the Dao**
My words are easy to know,
Easy to practice.
Simple and unadorned—
Yet none under heaven know or practice them.

*Focused unity*—
Words have their root;
*Essential substance*—
Affairs have their master.
*Return to the origin*—
Only the ignorant are unknown to me.
Knowledge reveals the *Way*.

Few know me, thus I am honored.
The *Way* is vast, so few comprehend it.
Thus the sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade,
Hiding brilliance to nurture integrity.

**Chapter 71: The Disease of Knowing**
Knowing yet pretending ignorance—*benefit*.
Ignoring yet pretending knowledge—*illness*.
Knowing as if ignorant—
Quickly invites resentment.
Ignoring yet forcing knowledge—
Invites misfortune.

Only because of this illness
Does one avoid illness.
The sage’s freedom from illness
Lies in treating illness as illness—
Thus he remains unharmed.

If people know their own illness,
They will not suffer greatly.

**Chapter 72: The Sage’s Contentment**
The people do not fear death—
How can death frighten them?
Seeing profit, they forget life—
This is not fearing death.

If one makes people constantly fear death,
And those who act strangely—
I could seize and kill them—
Who would dare?

*Strange* means *perverse*.
There are always those charged with killing.
Heaven, intending to remove evil,
Must use one hand.

To substitute for those who kill is like
A carpenter’s apprentice wielding the axe—
Few escape uninjured.
*Willfully causing harm*.

The sage does not dwell where he rests,
Nor chooses where to settle.
He is not sated by his food,
Nor dazzled by his garments.

Only because he is not sated
Does he not grow sated.
Not sated by things,
Nor sated by things.

Thus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Unknown by others yet unperturbed.
He values himself but does not exalt himself,
Humility to nurture himself.

Thus he discards that and takes this—
Discards external allure, takes inner joy.

**Chapter 73: The Peril of Boldness**
Boldness in daring leads to death,
Boldness in restraint leads to life.
Knowing these two,
One may gain or lose.

What does Heaven abhor?
Who knows its reason?
Thus the sage finds it difficult.

People know this and avoid death to seek life—*benefit*.
Yet some, knowing this, hasten their own death—*harm*.
Is this not how Heaven abhors people?

Who can grasp its intent?

Thus the sage does not dare lightly speak of Heaven’s *Way*.
Heaven’s *Way*:
Does not contend yet prevails,
Lets things be natural—none can defy it.
Does not speak yet responds—
Follows its course, answering with fortune or calamity.
Does not summon yet they come,
Does not hasten yet it arrives,
Does not move yet it reaches.
Effortless yet well-planned.

*Slow and measured*—
No haste, yet nothing fails.
Heaven’s net is vast—
Wide yet nothing slips.

*Vast*—a great appearance.

The people’s hunger comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes—thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ excessive interference—thus they are difficult to govern.
Disturbance is why they are difficult to govern.

The people’s indifference to death comes from their excessive pursuit of life—thus they lightly regard death.
To seek profit is how one sustains life, yet the people often lose their lives through profit.
Thus, only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who value it.
They forsake their own bodies, yet their bodies remain.

**Chapter 76**

The people’s birth is soft and weak,
Their death is firm and strong.
All things, grasses and trees, are soft and pliable when they live,
Yet when they die, they wither and decay.
Thus, the firm and strong are the companions of death,
While the soft and weak are the companions of life.
Therefore, armies that are strong yet overconfident do not conquer,
And those that are arrogant are destroyed.
Trees that are strong are split.
The strong are placed beneath, the weak above.

**Chapter 77**
Heaven’s *Way*—is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are pressed down, the low are raised up,
The overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplied.
Deficit and excess are balanced.
Heaven’s *Way*: diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.
But humanity’s *Way* is not so—
They diminish the deficient to honor the excessive.
They oppress the lowly to exalt the noble,
They plunder the poor to enrich the rich,
They burden the foolish with the wise,
They overwhelm the unworthy with the virtuous.
Who can use their excess to nourish the world?
Only those who follow the *Way*.
Thus, the sage acts yet does not claim credit,
Accomplishes yet does not dwell on it—
Is this not because they do not wish to see virtue perverted?
The sage’s virtue and power are in excess,
Thus they push it forward to give to others.

**Chapter 78**
Nowhere in the world is there anything softer and weaker than water,
Yet in overcoming the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—
Because water has no equal.
Thus, the soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
The world knows this, yet few can practice it.
Therefore the sage’s words say:
*"To bear the filth of the state is to be its lord and guardian;
To bear the ill omens of the state is to be the king of the world."*
Thus, upright words seem contrary.
To endure filth and accept impurity,
One may thereby achieve greatness.

**Chapter 79**
To reconcile great grudges,
There must always be some lingering resentment—
How can this be considered good?
Thus, the sage holds the left half of the contract,
Yet does not blame the other.
Therefore, those with *virtue/power* hold the contract,
While those without hold the full agreement.
Heaven’s *Way* favors none—
It always aligns with the good.

**Chapter 80**
In small states with few people,
Let there be the implements of ten families and a hundred households,
Yet do not use them.
Let the people value death yet not value moving.
Love life and cherish the land.
Though they have carriages and boats,
They have no place to ride upon them—
They do not travel.
Though they have weapons and armor,
They have no place to display them—
They do not fight.
Let the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.
Let them not deceive one another.
Let their food be simple yet satisfying,
Their clothing fine yet practical,
Their dwellings secure yet comfortable,
Their customs joyful yet unpretentious.
Though their ways seem coarse, repulsive, narrow, and crude,
They consider them satisfying, beautiful, secure, and joyful.
Neighboring states are visible to one another,
The sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
How close they are!
The people live out their days and die
Without ever visiting one another.
They have no desires.

**Chapter 80**
Trustworthy words are not ornate—
They are plain and true.
Ornate words are not trustworthy—
They are superficial and clever.
The good do not argue—
The fortunate few speak.
Those who argue are not good—
Falsehoods are sweetly spoken.
The wise are not all-knowing—
They hold one thread through all.
The all-knowing are not wise—
Many paths lead to lost sheep.
The sage does not hoard—
They do not take what is not theirs.

The Dao of Heaven,
When given to others, the more they have, the more I possess—
Virtue and wisdom are boundless.
When taken from others, the more they have, the more I lose—
Yet the more I take, the more I gain.
The Dao of Heaven,
Benefits without harming;
Spring brings forth growth, autumn yields harvest—
Thus, it adorns and nourishes all beneath the sky.

The Dao of the sage,
Acts without contention.
Unable to act without purpose,
Yet aids without coercion.
Virtue and the *Way* of the *Zhenjing* conclude here, Volume Four.
