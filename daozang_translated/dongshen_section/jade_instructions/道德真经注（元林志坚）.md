**Preface to the Commentary on the Dao De Jing**

The Dao is **august** and **virtue** is **noble**—such is the foundation upon which the heavens and earth rest.
Countless ancient sages and worthy predecessors have left many commentaries on the sacred texts.
*"Birth and death"* (生死) is the method of cultivating one’s self.
*"Non-action yet transformation"* (無為而化) is the profound strategy for governing the world.

Those who **illuminate the heart and perceive true nature** (明心見性) know that the chapter *"The Mysterious Pivot of the Vital Spirit"* (谷神不死) is the most sublime.
Statesmen who **govern well and bring peace to the people** (治國安民) recognize that *"The Method of Rectifying Governance"* (以正治國) is deeply profound.
In life, nothing surpasses these two.

In my leisure hours, I quietly contemplated the wondrous classics of the sages and worthies,
And suddenly **awoke to the source of the cosmos’ transformation** (造化之渊源).
With humble intent, I forgot my own limitations and **pretended** to follow the **Dao De Jing** of the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** (太上老君) from beginning to end,
Using the **authentic commentary** (正經) to annotate the **authentic text** (正經) below,
**Interpreting the text with the text itself** (以經解經),
Merely **grasping a fraction of its meaning** (略知經意).
How could I ever **fully penetrate its depths** (表裏相通)?
Yet if one **studies it diligently and savors its words** (熟讀玩味),
One will naturally **awaken to the profound mysteries** (解悟) of the **authentic text** (正經).
The **gateway to the Dao** (入道之門戶) and the **foundation of virtue** (立德之根基) are thus made clear.

**Sīmǎ Guāng** said:
*"It is not the Dao of the ordinary, hence not known by ordinary men."* (非常之道，故非常人之所知)

**Zhū Wēngōng** (朱文公) said:
*"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao."* (道而可道，則非常道)
*"The name that can be named is not the eternal Name."* (名而可名，則非常名)

I often pondered deeply:
*"Those who claim self-illumination do not truly see."* (自見者不明)
*"Those who assert self-nature do not truly shine."* (自是者不彰)

With **no fear of presumption** (不避僭越之愆),
I **cross-referenced** the text—
How could this be called a mere **preface and commentary** (序注)?
How could it ever be **perfect**? (何能盡善也欤)

May **future virtuous scholars** (候來之君子) who encounter it **not begrudge** (見之勿吝)
And **must surely refine and correct** (必須刪削，以求斧正),
For this would be most **beneficial** (深為良矣).

Written on a **auspicious day in the sixth lunar month** (孟夏吉日),
In the year **Jiǎwù** (甲午) of **Zhìzhèng** (至正) [1344],
By **Lín Zhìjiān** of **Guǎnglíng** (廣陵), **Rénzhāi** (仁齋).

**The Dao De Jing**

The Dao is **august** and **virtue** is **noble**—
Yet it **abides naturally** (常自然).
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
I do not know its name, so I call it **the Dao**.
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name;
The Dao **conceals itself without name** (隱無名).

**The Nameless** (無名) is the **origin of the heavens and earth** (天地之始).
When the world has an origin, it is called **the Mother of the World** (天下母).
**The One** (一) generates **the Two** (二),
**The Two** generate **the Three** (三),
**The Three** generate **the Ten Thousand Things** (萬物).
The Ten Thousand Things **carry yin and embrace yang** (負陰抱陽),
**Interpenetrating qi** (沖氣) to achieve **harmony** (和).
To know **harmony** is to know **the Constant** (常).

To know **the Constant** is to be **tolerant** (容),
**Tolerance** leads to **impartiality** (公),
**Impartiality** leads to **sovereignty** (王),
**Sovereignty** leads to **heavenly rule** (天),
**Heavenly rule** leads to **the Dao** (道).
The Dao **operates through natural law** (法自然).

The **Dao of Heaven** (天之道) benefits without harming;
It is like **drawing a bow** (其猶張弓乎).
The **high** are **lowered**; the **low** are **raised**,
The **lacking** are **supplied**; the **excessive** are **reduced**.
Yet **human governance** (人之道) is not so.
Who among men can **have surplus to bestow upon the world** (有餘以奉天下)?
Only **those who follow the Dao** (有道者).

The Ten Thousand Things **act without complaint** (作而不辭),
**Generate without possession** (生而不有),
**Do without claiming** (為而不恃),
**Grow without mastering** (長而不宰)—
This is called **Mysterious Virtue** (玄德).

The **Dao of the Sage** (聖人之道) acts without striving,
**Embraces the One** (抱一) as a **model for the world** (為天下式).
**Fine words** (美言) can **command respect** (市尊),
**Good deeds** (行) can **win favor** (加人).
Yet **men’s flaws** (人之不善) are **not cast aside** (何棄之有)?

**The Sage’s virtue** (常善) **rescues men** (救人), hence **no man is abandoned** (故無棄人),
**The Sage’s virtue** rescues things, hence **no thing is cast off** (故無棄物)—
This is called **the Illuminating Pattern** (是謂襲明).
Thus, when **establishing the Son of Heaven** (立天子) and **appointing the Three Ministers** (置三公),
Even **if one offers the jade tablet with six horses** (雖有拱璧以先驷馬),
It is **not as good as simply practicing this Dao** (不如坐進此道).

**When achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw** (功成名遂身退)—
This is the **Dao of Heaven** (天之道).

I have heard that **those who excel in preserving life** (善摄生者)
**Walk on land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger** (陸行不遇兕虎),
**Enter battle yet are not harmed by weapons or armor** (入軍不被甲兵).
The rhinoceros **does not strike with its horn** (兕無投其角),
The tiger **cannot place its claws** (虎無所措爪),
Weapons **cannot reach their blade** (兵無所容其刃).
Why so?
Because they **abide in the realm of no death** (以其無死地).

---

**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken Is Not the Eternal Dao**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The Dao follows its own nature.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The Dao is nameless.

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao generates **One** (一).
The named is the mother of all things.
**Three** generates the myriad things.

Always without desire, one observes its subtlety,
Reaching the utmost emptiness.
Always with desire, one observes its peril.
Guard stillness with sincerity.

These two, though issuing from the same source yet bearing different names—
Always with desire, always without desire—
Are called the **Mysterious Unity** (玄同).
The **Mysterious Unity**, again mysterious,
Is the gateway to all wonders.
The **Gate of the Mysterious Female** (玄牝之门),
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

---

**Chapter Two: Nurturing Life**
All under Heaven know beauty when it is called beauty—
Then ugliness already exists.
The Dao is in accord with the Dao.
All know goodness when it is called good—
Then evil already exists.
**Virtue/power** (德) is in accord with **virtue/power**.

Thus, being and non-being generate each other:
All things under Heaven arise from being,
Being arises from non-being.
Difficulty and ease give rise to each other:
Much ease necessarily brings much difficulty.
Long and short define each other—
This is called the form of the formless.
High and low lean upon each other:
The high necessarily takes the low as its foundation.
Sounds harmonize with each other:
The Dao is boundless yet effective in its use.
Before and after follow each other:
Approaching, one sees no head;
Following, one sees no tail.

Thus, the Sage acts in affairs of non-action,
Doing nothing yet nothing remains undone.
Teaching without speech,
Rarely speaking yet naturally effective.
All things arise yet he does not claim them,
Creating yet not possessing,
The Dao as a thing.
When achievement is complete, he does not dwell upon it—
Only because he does not dwell upon it does he not depart.
When achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw—
The Dao of Heaven.

---

**Chapter Three: Settling the People**
**Concentrate the qi and attain softness**—
One can embrace an infant.
**Block the orifice** (塞其兑), **close the gate** (閉其門),
**Empty the mind** (虚其心), **fill the belly** (实其腹),
**Weaken the will** (弱其志), **strengthen the bones** (强其骨)—
This is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored** (深根固蒂),
The Dao of **long life and enduring vision** (长生久视).

**Govern the great realm as one cooks a small fish**—
The great should act as the lowly,
Not daring to assert strength.
With the Dao to govern the world,
Its spirits will not be formidable.

**Assisting the sovereign with the Dao**—
One does not use force to compel the world.
Such affairs will naturally return.
**Fine weapons are ominous instruments**,
Not the tools of the **Noble One** (君子).
They are used only when unavoidable.
When using force, one says:
*"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
Not daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot."*
Why so?
**He who abandons what comes after for what comes first is already dead.**

Thus the Sage says:
*"I do nothing yet the people transform themselves,
I take no action yet the people grow rich,
I desire nothing yet the people return to simplicity,
I value stillness yet the people become upright.
If one does not desire to remain still,
The world will naturally settle itself."*

---

**The Proper Sequence of the Canon**
How then is the **Canon** (正经) arranged in order?
It is said:
The Dao is the **ancestral origin** (宗祖) that generates all things,
The **fundamental root** (根元) that divides Heaven and Earth.
The Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,
Generating Heaven and Earth,
An enduring Dao since antiquity.
Thus, the Dao’s preeminence is placed first in the sequence.

The Dao generates **One** (一).
**One** generates **Two** (二).
When yin and yang are divided,
The light and clear ascend as Heaven,
The heavy and turbid descend as Earth.
Thus, the Dao of Heaven follows next.

**Two** generates **Three** (三).
Yin and yang rise and fall,
And between them, humanity is formed.
Thus, the Dao of the Sage follows next.

The **Three Powers** (三才) are complete.
Therefore, **cultivating the self is the foundation**—
Thus, it is heard that those who excel in preserving life follow next.
Cultivating the self extends to governing the realm and pacifying the world—
Thus, *"governing the great realm as one cooks a small fish"* follows next.
When applied, it fills the space between Heaven and Earth;
When withdrawn, it is hidden within the six directions.
Affairs have beginnings and ends,
Things have roots and branches.
Thus, the **Canon** is arranged in this order alone.

**Chapter Three: Governing with Virtue**

Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.
Love oneself without esteeming oneself.
Do not prize rare treasures, so the people do not steal.
Abandon cleverness and discard profit, then thieves will vanish.
Make no desires visible, so the heart remains undisturbed.
Purify and refine—how could there be any flaw?
Thus, the Sage governs:
Establishing the Son of Heaven,
Emptying the heart—great virtue is like a valley.
Filling the belly—embracing the One, how could it depart?
Weakening the will—concentrating qi to attain softness.
Strengthening the bones—holding to softness is strength.
Always keep the people without knowledge or desire.
Good governance lies here.
Let the wise dare not act.
To love the people and govern the realm—how could it be without action?
To act without action, then nothing remains untamed.
I act without action, and the people transform themselves.

---

**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Use**

The Dao is boundless yet applied—
Its harmony is supreme.
It is never full.
Great fullness is like emptiness.
Deep as if the root of all things,
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things.
Dulling the sharp, unraveling the tangled,
Holding to the ancient Way.
Dimming its radiance, blending with dust.
Muddled as if turbid.
Dark as if stored,
Endless as if preserved.
I do not know whose child it is—
The image of the Sovereign before Heaven.
I do not know its name—
Call it *Dao*.

---

**Chapter Five: The Chapter of Empty Use**

Heaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as straw dogs.
They give life yet do not possess.
The Sage is not kind—they treat the people as straw dogs.
They act yet do not rely.
Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like a bellows?
Vast as a valley,
Empty yet unyielding—
Great virtue is like a valley.
The more it moves, the more it emerges—
Move in perfect timing.
Many words lead to exhaustion—
The speaker does not know.
Better to hold to the center.
The wise do not speak.

---

**Chapter Six: The Chapter of Formed Images**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
The Way of eternal life and clear vision.
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The ancients valued this Way.
The Mysterious Female’s gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things.
Endless as if preserved,
Diligently practiced.
Used without strain.
The Dao is boundless yet applied.

---

**Chapter Seven: The Chapter of Concealing Light**

Heaven is enduring, Earth is long-lasting.
Those of old who attained the One—
Heaven and Earth endure long because they embrace the One without separation.
Since they do not generate themselves, they attain eternal life.
They give life yet do not possess.
Thus, the Sage puts himself last, yet comes first.
To lead the people, he must place himself behind them.
Detaching himself, he preserves himself.
Using what is not, he achieves utility.
Not because he is without self-interest—
Thus, he fulfills his own.
Therefore, the Sage finds it difficult,
Yet in the end, there is no difficulty.

---

**Chapter Eight: The Chapter of Changing Nature**

The highest goodness is like water.
Concentrating qi to attain softness.
Water benefits all things without contention,
Bending preserves it whole.
Dwelling where others abhor—
Thus, it approaches the Dao.
Nothing is softer or weaker than water,
Yet it excels in occupying low ground.
Timid as if fearing its neighbors.
The heart is deep—
Great virtue is like a valley.
Kindness is benevolent—
Heaven’s Way has no favorites, always aiding the good.
Words are trustworthy—
No words are spoken, yet all respond.
Governance is good—
Rule the realm with rectitude.
Actions are skillful—
Act without action.
Move in perfect timing—
Hold to the ancient Way.
Only by not contending
Is there no blame.
This is called the virtue of non-contention.

---

**Chapter Nine: The Chapter of Even Flow**

Holding to fullness is not as good as stopping in time.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
Sharpening the blade cannot be preserved long.
Fine weapons are inauspicious instruments.
Gold and jade fill the halls—
No one can guard them.
Excessive love brings great expenditure.
Rich and noble yet arrogant—
They invite their own ruin.
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace.
When achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw—
This is Heaven’s Way.
Achievement complete, yet unnamed—
This is the power of the able.

---

**Chapter Ten: The Chapter of Embracing the One**

Nurturing the spirit and embracing the One—
How could it separate?
The good at embracing do not lose it.
Concentrating qi to attain softness—
One can be like an infant.
Harmony is supreme.
Purify and refine—
How could there be any flaw?
Always without desire, observing its subtlety.
Loving the people and governing the realm—
How could it be without action?
I act without action, and the people transform themselves.
Heaven’s gate opens and shuts—
How could it be without the Feminine?
All things carry yin and embrace yang.
Clear and boundless—
How could it be without knowing?
Though knowing, it is great confusion—
This is called the essential mystery.
Nourishing and preserving—
All things act together.

**Chapter Eleven: The Chapter of the Utility of the Non-Utilitarian**

Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
Yet all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.
When its utility is absent, the vehicle’s function remains.
Vast as the valley, it is empty.

Molded clay forms vessels,
Yet before the vessel exists, there is a thing of mixed unity,
Born prior to heaven and earth.
When its utility is absent, the vessel’s function remains.

Hollow out the heart—
Pierce doors and windows to create a dwelling.
The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things.
When its utility is absent, the dwelling’s function remains.

Like the bellows of a bagpipe.

Thus, having gives rise to advantage,
Yet all things obtain the One to generate.
Without gives rise to utility.

Act without action, and nothing remains ungoverned.

**Chapter Twelve: The Chapter of Restraining Desires**

Five hues blind the eyes;
The common people see clearly.
Five tones deaf the ears;
The common people hear distinctly.
Five flavors dull the palate;
One loathes eating and drinking.
Galloping and hunting make the heart frenzied.
Lightness leads to losing one’s ministers,
Impetuosity leads to losing one’s king.
Hard-to-obtain treasures bring misfortune.
No sin is greater than the desire for gain.

Therefore, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.
Thus, he discards that and takes this.

He dwells in substance, not in its splendor.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Chapter of Disdaining Shame**

Favor and insult are like a sudden fright—
Stiff as though ice were about to shatter.
Treasure great misfortune as one’s own body—
Cautious as though crossing a river in winter.

What is meant by *favor and insult*?
Know its honor and guard against its disgrace.
Disgrace is lowly.
Gain it as though in fright, lose it as though in fright—
This is called *favor and insult are like a sudden fright*.

Wealth brings responsibility, yet arrogance invites blame.
What is meant by *treasure great misfortune as one’s own body*?
Which is closer: name or body?
The reason I have great misfortune is that I have a body.
Exclude the body, yet the body remains.
When I have no body, what misfortune do I have?
Gain and loss—what is more harmful?
Therefore, he who values his body as the world
Can entrust himself to the world.
He who is self-conceited does not endure.
He who loves his body as the world
Can commit himself to the world.
He loves himself but does not value himself.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Chapter of Praising the Mysterious**

See it, yet it cannot be seen—called *level*.
See it, yet it is not enough to see.
Hear it, yet it cannot be heard—called *rare*.
Hear it, yet it is not enough to hear.
Grasp it, yet it cannot be obtained—called *subtle*.
The great image is formless.
These three cannot be forced to explain.

Subtle, mysterious, and penetrating—
Deep, beyond recognition.
Thus, they merge into One.
Its attainment is One.

Above, it does not dazzle;
Below, it does not obscure.
It harmonizes its light.

Faint and indistinct, beyond naming—
The Dao is always without name.
Returning to the formless, this is called the *state of the stateless*.
Dazed and blurred,
Yet within it, there is an image.
The image of the formless—
This is called *blurred and dazed*.

The Dao as a thing
Is only blurred and only indistinct.
Approach it, yet you do not see its head;
Follow it, yet you do not see its tail.
Swift as the sea, drifting without end.

Cling to the ancient Dao to govern the present,
The world has a beginning,
And the Dao is the mother of the world.

With knowledge of the ancient beginning, this is called the *Dao’s foundation*.
From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade.

**Chapter Fifteen: Manifest Virtue**

The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, profound, and penetrating—
Deep beyond recognition.
Rich in virtue’s depth,
Yet because they could not be recognized,
They feigned outward forms.

The Dao as a thing
Is only blurred and indistinct.
Cautious as winter crossing a river,
Only action is to be feared.
Timid as one wary of neighbors,
Knowing white yet holding to black.
Solemn as a guest,
Seeing simplicity, embracing purity.
Dissolving as ice about to thaw,
Cautious as winter crossing a river.
Genuine as uncarved wood,
Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade.
Vast as a valley,
Thus the Dao’s presence in the world.

Muddled as turbid waters,
Harmonizing its light.
Who can endure turbidity long?
Stillness, and clarity comes gradually.
Diligently guard stillness.
Who can endure rest long?
Motion, and life arises gradually.
Rich in virtue’s depth.

Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness—
Great fullness is like emptiness.
Only because it is not full
Can it endure without renewal.
Advancing the Dao is like retreating.

**Chapter Sixteen: Returning to the Root**

**Chapter Seventeen: Purity of the Primordial Way**
---
When emptiness is fully attained,
Vast as a valley, it stands.
If lords and kings could steadfastly preserve stillness,
All things would come to them of their own accord.

When all things flourish together,
I observe their return.
The Way’s motion is in reversal.
All things, myriad and teeming,
Each return to their own root.

Having known their offspring,
Return and guard their mother.
Returning to the root is stillness,
Stillness is the restoration of life.
Using its radiance, returning to its brightness—
Restoration of life is constancy,
Ever-cycling without end.

Knowing constancy is brightness,
The Great Way is most smooth.
Not knowing constancy,
Acting recklessly brings ruin.

True reversal is the marvelous,
Virtuous reversal is the strange.
When the people are deluded, their error grows long.

Knowing constancy and embracing it,
Lords and kings take this as the rectitude for all under heaven.
Embrace is the universal,
The universal is the kingly,
The kingly is the heavenly,
The heavenly is the Dao.

The Dao is the hidden essence of all things.
The Dao endures—
Lifelong without peril.
Non-Dao fades swiftly.
**Chapter Eighteen: The Noble Wind**
---
The Noble Way is lost,
Then benevolence and righteousness arise.
When the Way is lost,
Then virtue appears.
When wisdom emerges,
Great deceit flourishes.
To rule the state with wisdom,
Is to be a thief to the state.

The six bonds are discordant,
Yet filial piety and kindness exist.
Severing benevolence and discarding righteousness,
The people return to filial piety and kindness.
The state falls into chaos,
Yet loyal ministers appear.
To love the people and govern the state,
Can one truly do nothing?

**Chapter Nineteen: Restoring Simplicity**
---
Severing the Sage, discarding wisdom,
The people gain a hundredfold.
I act with no contrivance,
And the people prosper naturally.
Severing benevolence and discarding righteousness,
The people return to filial piety and kindness.
I have no desires,
And the people remain simple.
Severing cleverness and discarding gain,
Thieves and robbers cease to exist.
The difficult-to-obtain is not prized.

「For these three things as ornamentation are insufficient,
To illuminate the Dao as if in darkness.
Thus, they lead people to have their own affiliations.
I will take them as my teaching father.

Seeing the plain and embracing simplicity,
One in coarse garments holds jade within.
With few private concerns and scant desires,
I always have no desires to observe its subtlety.

**Chapter Twenty: Rejecting Learning and Worry**
---
Rejecting learning and abandoning care,
The Dao subtly flows, mysterious and profound.
How far apart are *wu* and *ā*?
These two arise from the same source yet bear different names.

How far apart are good and evil?
How distant are *wu* and *ā*?
That which people fear,
One must indeed fear—
If the people do not fear authority,
Then great tyranny will surely come.
Boundless and ceaseless is its depth,
Swift as the sea.

The common folk rejoice and thrive,
As if feasting on grand sacrificial offerings,
As if ascending to Spring Terrace.
In wealth and honor, they grow arrogant,
Yet I alone stand in dread—
Its signs not yet revealed,
Like an infant yet to speak.

The depth of my virtue compares to that of a newborn.
Steadfast and unshaken,
As if having nowhere to return.

Compare the Dao in the world:
The common folk all have surplus,
Their brilliance evident.
Yet I alone seem abandoned,
My virtue built as if by stealth.
My heart is that of a foolish man—
Pure and unadulterated.

Shining yet not dazzling,
The common folk, though bright,
See themselves yet fail to understand.
I alone seem dim,
Illuminating the Dao as if in shadow.
The common folk, though keen,
The learned yet do not know.»

I alone am murky and obscure.
Advancing the Dao seems like retreat.

Drifting like the sea, yet boundless—
Floating like a vessel with no shore.

The boundless has no corners.

The common folk all have their own ways,
Yet they do not know the sickness of knowing.
I alone seem dull and coarse,
Yet follow the Dao as if by nature.

I alone differ from others,
Yet hold the Mother of All in highest esteem.

The profound virtue is deep and distant,
Opposed to all things.

**Chapter 21: The Virtue of the Empty Heart**
The bearing of the sage’s virtue
Follows the Dao alone.
The highest virtue is like a valley.

The Dao as a thing
Is only vague, only hazy.
The great image has no form.
Hazy and vague, yet within it lies the image.
The image of a formless thing—
This is called vague and hazy.

Vague and hazy, yet within it lies the thing.
This is called the form of formlessness.
Dim and shadowy, yet within it lies the essence.
All things arise from existence,
Existence from non-existence.
Its essence is most true,
Within it lies sincerity.
Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower depths are not murky.
From ancient times to today,
Its name has never faded.
Hold the ancient Dao to govern the present existence,
To observe the common folk.
By what do I know the common folk’s nature?
By this.

All under heaven know beauty to be beauty—

**Chapter 22: The Harmony of Contraries**
The crooked is complete,

**Chapter 22: The Harmony of Contraries (continued)**
Weaken their resolve.
The crooked becomes straight,
Empty their minds.
The hollow becomes full.
Expand virtue as though it were insufficient—
Then it is renewed.
Great brightness as though it were shame—
Then one gains much.

Few words bring clarity,
The wise do not speak.
Many words bring confusion,
Those who speak do not know.

Thus the Sage holds *One* as the model for all under heaven,
While lords and kings use *One* as the standard for all under heaven.
Not self-illuminating, hence clarity,
Self-illuminating, hence no clarity.
Not self-affirming, hence brilliance,
Self-affirming, hence no brilliance.
Not self-praising, hence merit,
Self-praising, hence no merit.
Not self-exalting, hence longevity,
Self-exalting, hence no longevity.

Only he who does not contend
Can thus have no rival in all under heaven.
Only he who does not contend
Can thus have no grievance.

Was the ancient saying *"The crooked is complete"* mere idle talk?
Indeed, it is complete and returns to *One*.

He who dwells where others abhor
Comes close to the Dao.

---

**Chapter 23: The Chapter of Emptiness and Non-Existence**
Rarely speak, yet it is natural.
Name without seeing,
Achieve without doing.

The gusting wind does not last a morning,
The sudden rain does not last a day.
Without grasping, there is no loss.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth—
The Dao’s most honored.

Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
How much less so man?
Heaven too will know this.

Thus those who follow the Dao
Are in harmony with the Dao.
The faithful, I trust them.
The virtuous, I align with their virtue.
The good, I praise their goodness.
The fallen, I share their loss.
But if there is no trust,
Those in harmony with the Dao
Find the Dao rejoices in them.
All under heaven know beauty as beauty—
The virtuous find virtue rejoices in them.
All under heaven know goodness as goodness—
The fallen find loss rejoices in them.
Fine words are not trusted.
Trust is insufficient—
There is no trust.
Self-illuminating, hence no clarity—
The common folk are bright and clear.

---

**Chapter 24: The Chapter of Noble Humility**
The limping cannot stand,
The straddling cannot walk.
Many words exhaust one’s resources—
Better to hold to the center.

Self-illuminating, hence no clarity,
The common folk are sharp and discerning.
Self-affirming, hence no brilliance,
The common folk are keen and observant.
Self-praising, hence no merit,
All men have their own rewards.
Self-exalting, hence no longevity,
Low virtue does not lose its virtue.

As for the Dao,
It says: *"Excess food, superfluous movement."*
The Great Dao is smooth, yet men love narrow paths.
Some may hate it,
Thus the Dao does not dwell among them.

Good deeds leave no tracks.
The Chapter of the Original Image

---

**Chapter 25: The Chapter of the Original Image (continued)**
There is a thing, formless and complete,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
The Dao gave birth to it,
Virtue nurtured it.
Silent and vast—
The great image has no form.

It stands alone yet never changes,
It moves in cycles yet never begins.
Long-lasting is he who does not lose his place.
He can be the mother of all under heaven.
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

I do not know its name,
So I call it the Dao.
The Dao is hidden, nameless.
If forced to name it, I call it *Great*.
The Dao follows natural law.
*Great* is called *Passing*,
The great square has no corners.
*Passing* is called *Far*,
Swift as the sea.
*Far* is called *Return*.
*Return* is the movement of the Dao.

Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is great.
The Dao’s most honored.

Within the central realm are the Four Great Ones,
And the king is one of them.
Thus the Son of Heaven is established.
Man follows Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows natural law.
Thus they merge as One.

---

**Chapter 26: The Chapter of Weighty Virtue**
Weighty virtue is the root of lightness,
High must have low as its foundation.
Stillness is the master of agitation,
Stillness overcomes heat.
Thus the noble man walks all day
Without leaving his burdens behind.
He stands alone yet never changes,
Though adorned with splendor,
He rests in transcendence.
He clings steadfastly to stillness.

How can the lord of ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself for all under heaven?
He who loves to bear the weight of all under heaven
Can thus entrust himself to all under heaven.
Lightness leads to losing his ministers,
Agitation leads to losing his subjects.
Purity and clarity belong to all under heaven.

---

**Chapter 27: The Chapter of Skillful Action**

**Chapter 27: The Chapter of Skillful Action**

Skillful action leaves no trace,
Action without action.
Skillful speech leaves no flaw or blemish,
Action without the need for words.
Skillful planning does not rely on calculations,
Yet when used, it cannot be exhausted.
Skillful closure requires no locks or bars yet cannot be opened,
Yet holding to the One, he never departs.
Skillful binding needs no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.
He stands alone yet never changes.
Thus the sage always acts with beneficence,
And so there are no abandoned people—
His words are treasured by all.
He always acts with beneficence toward all things,
And so there are no abandoned things.
His actions are revered by all under heaven.
This is called *clinging to clarity*.
He employs its radiance,
Yet returns to its clarity.
Thus the good man is not the teacher of the unworthy,
The *Dao* is honored.
The unworthy become the good man’s aid,
Yet virtue nurtures them.
He does not esteem his teacher,
He loves himself yet does not exalt himself.
He does not love his aid,
The *Dao* is ever without action.

Though wise, yet greatly confused,
This is called the *essential mystery*.
The *Dao* is smooth yet varied.
Returning to simplicity is like returning to nature.
Know its strength,
Yet hold to its weakness.
The receptive always overcomes the active through stillness.
Be the valley of all under heaven.
Compare the *Dao*’s presence in all under heaven—
Be the valley of all under heaven,
Yet virtue never strays.
Holding to the One, he never departs.
Return to the infant.
The depth of his virtue is like that of a newborn.
Know its whiteness,
Yet hold to its blackness,
Radiant yet not dazzling.
Be the model of all under heaven.
Holding to the One, he is the model of all under heaven.
Be the model of all under heaven,
Yet virtue never falters.
Knowing constancy is wisdom.
Return to the boundless.
Its use is inexhaustible.

Know its splendor,
Yet hold to its humiliation,
Knowing contentment brings no shame.
Be the valley of all under heaven.
Unfathomable like the sea.
Be the valley of all under heaven,
Yet virtue is ever sufficient.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
Return to simplicity.
The humble in rags yet holding jade within.

Simplicity, when scattered, becomes vessels.
All things blend in unity,
Born before heaven and earth.
The sage employs them,
Yet they become rulers and officials.
Thus great measures are not cut short.
High virtue acts without action.

**Chapter 29: The Chapter of Non-Action**
When one seeks to take all under heaven by force,
I see it as not inevitable.
Taking all under heaven is always done without strife.
All under heaven is a divine vessel—
It cannot be forced.
Thus without action comes no defeat.
The one who acts brings defeat upon himself,
The one who grasps loses.
Without grasping comes no loss.
Thus some things act, some follow,
The latter always align with the former.
Some exhale, some inhale,
Their sounds harmonize.
Some are strong, some weak,
Yet strength leads to decline.
Some are raised, some toppled,
High and low balance each other.
Thus the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids arrogance.
He dwells in substance, not in ornament.
This is called *modest military virtue*.

**Chapter 31: The Chapter of Laying Down Arms**
He who aids the ruler with the *Dao*
Does not use force to dominate all under heaven.
When he governs all under heaven with the *Dao*,
Its spirits are not feared.
His undertakings are well-received.
When one seeks to seize it,
He must first firmly give it.
Where the army encamps,
Briars and thorns grow.
Some things oppose it,
Thus the one who holds the *Dao* does not dwell there.
After great armies, there will surely be years of hardship.
Skillful action leaves no trace.
Thus the good man is resolute yet unassuming—
All under heaven know virtue as virtue,
Yet the unworthy do not.
He does not dare to take by force.
The forceful will not meet their end.
Resolute yet not boastful,
Avoid excess.
Resolute yet not arrogant,
Avoid arrogance.
Resolute yet not proud,
Avoid extravagance.
Resolute yet not forced,
Not forced yet used.
Resolute yet not strong.
He does not dare to take by force.
Strength leads to decline—
This is called *not the Dao*.
*Not the Dao* brings early ruin.
The obstinate meet death.
Thus the sage lays down arms.

**Chapter 32: The Chapter of the Sage’s Virtue**
The *Dao* is ever nameless.
Though simplicity is small,
All under heaven dare not submit to it.
If I were to know it with certainty,
Only reverence would follow.
The lords and kings, if they could guard it,
All things would come of their own accord.
Thus virtue returns to its source.
Heaven and earth unite,
All things receive the yin and embrace the yang,
Descending sweet dew,
The *Dao* gives birth to them.
No one commands them,
Yet they are naturally balanced.
Thus constancy is ever natural.
At first, simplicity had no name.
Once named, it was named.
Knowing the ancient origin,
This is called the *Dao’s* record.
Even heaven would know it.
The *Dao* can be spoken of,
Yet knowing this prevents no danger.
Knowing constancy is wisdom.
Compare the *Dao*’s presence in all under heaven—
Like rivers and valleys to the sea.
The great *Dao* flows freely,
It cannot be confined to left or right.

**Chapter 33: The Chapter of Discerning Virtue***
To know others is wisdom,
Yet to discern is not virtue.
To know oneself is clarity.
Those of old who attained the One—
The one who conquers has strength,
Yet today he abandons kindness and relies on courage.
The one who overcomes himself is strong,
Strengthening his resolve.
The one who knows contentment is rich,
Yet gold and jade fill his halls and he cannot guard them.
The one who acts resolutely has purpose,
Circumventing all without failing.
The one who does not lose his place endures long,

**Chapter 34: The Chapter of Natural Simplicity**

Stand alone yet never alter.
Die yet never perish—this is longevity.
Detach from the self, and the self endures.

The great *Dao* flows freely,
It cannot be confined to left or right.
The perfect square has no corners.
All things rely on it to live yet it does not claim them.
Heaven and Earth act without kindness,
Treating all things as mere fodder for dogs.

When the work is done, claim no merit.
When the work is done and the name secured, withdraw—
This is the *Dao* of Heaven.
Nurture all things yet claim no mastery,
Give birth yet do not possess.
Thus, to always lack desire,
One may be called *small*.
Though crude and small,
The world dares not enslave it.
All things return to it yet it claims no mastery—
This may be called *great*.
If lords and kings could guard this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
Thus, the Sage never seeks greatness,
And so achieves greatness.

The highest virtue lacks virtue,
And so possesses virtue.

---

**Chapter 35: The Chapter of Virtuous Power**

Hold the great image,
And all under heaven will come.
Lords and kings who attain the One
Use it to rectify the world.
Go forth yet cause no harm,
Bringing peace and ease.
All things return to it yet it claims no mastery.
Delight and bait—
Passing travelers rest.
All know goodness as goodness.
When the *Dao* leaves the mouth,
Its taste is bland and insipid—
Who can fathom its depth?
Look upon it, yet it cannot be seen—
The great image is formless.
Listen to it, yet it cannot be heard—
The great sound is rare.
Use it, yet it is never exhausted.
Its use is endless.

---

**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Subtle Brilliance**

When you wish to gather, first spread wide.
The graspers lose it.
When you wish to weaken, first strengthen.
The soft overcomes the hard.
When you wish to destroy, first establish.
Subtract to increase.
When you wish to take, first give.
Add to diminish.
This is called subtle brilliance,
A profound virtue.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
The weak is the *Dao*’s use.
Fish cannot escape the depths—
The skillful embrace does not lose.
The state’s sharpest tools
Must not be shown to the people.
The world’s divine instruments
Cannot be wielded.

---

**Chapter 37: The Chapter of Governance**

The *Dao* acts without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
Thus, the Sage dwells in non-action.
If lords and kings could guard this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
Hold the great image,
And all under heaven will come.
Transform yet do not force—
The people fear no threats.
I will govern them with stillness,
Using the *Dao* to rule the world.
With the nameless crude,
It is named yet unseen.
The nameless crude—
It also desires nothing.
I desire nothing, yet the people transform of their own accord.
Desire nothing to remain still—
The world will rectify itself.
I love stillness, and the people will rectify themselves.

**Chapter 39: The Chapter of the One**

Of old, those who attained the One
Could be spoken of as *Dao*.
Heaven, by the One, attains clarity,
And the *Dao* gives birth to the One.
Earth, by the One, attains tranquility,
And thus knows the ancient beginning.
The *Spirit* (神), by the One, attains responsiveness,
And the *Taoist Sage* (太上) knows what is.
The *Valley* (谷), by the One, attains fullness,
And the *Dao* gives birth to it.
All things, by the One, attain life,
And *virtue* (德) nurtures them.
Lords and kings, by the One, establish order for the world.
Embrace the One to serve as a model for the world.
This is how the One is attained.
The *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.
If Heaven lacks clarity,
It will fear collapse,
And the great *Dao* will be abandoned.
If Earth lacks tranquility,
It will fear upheaval,
And the ancient ways will be unknown.
If the *Spirit* lacks responsiveness,
It will fear stagnation,
And the *Dao* will already have vanished.
If the *Valley* lacks fullness,
It will fear exhaustion,
And will bring ruin upon itself.
If all things lack the One to sustain them,
They will fear annihilation—
This is called *non-Dao*.
If lords and kings lack the One to ennoble them,
They will fear decline.
If they are rich and noble yet arrogant,
Then nobility must take humility as its foundation,
The great must take the lowly as its base,
The high must take the lowly as its support.
He who best uses people is lowly.
Thus, lords and kings call themselves *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂).
The *virtue* of the highest is not virtuous—
Is this not taking humility as its foundation?
Thus, nobility must take humility as its foundation.
Is this not so?
Hence, the fewest carriages are the most honored.
Shine without dazzling—
Do not desire brilliance like jade,
Nor solidity like stone.
It cannot be seized to make noble,
Nor seized to make lowly.

**Chapter 40: The Chapter of Returning**

The *Dao* moves by reversing,
Each returning to its root.
The weak is the *Dao*’s use.
Focus the *qi* (氣) to govern the soft.
The world’s myriad things arise from the *Having* (有),
And the *Having* arises from the *Non-Having* (无).
The *Dao* gives birth to the One,
The One gives birth to the Two,
The Two gives birth to the Three,
And the Three gives birth to all things.

**Chapter 41: The Chapter of Similarity and Difference**

The superior man hears the *Dao* and strives to practice it.
Of old, those who excelled in the *Dao*...
The middle man hears the *Dao* and holds it as if it were something,
As if it were nothing—
Who knows its limit?
The lowly man hears the *Dao* and laughs at it.
If he does not laugh, it is not the *Dao*.
The people’s confusion!
Thus, I establish words and names,
Thus, I command things to have their proper places.
The *Dao* is clear yet seems obscure,
Shining yet not dazzling.
The *Dao* is plain yet seems unlike others,
Knowing its white yet guarding its black.
Advancing the *Dao* seems like retreat,
Great achievement seems like a lack.
The highest *virtue* seems like a *Valley*,
Emptying the mind.
The greatest purity seems like shame,
The greatest rectitude seems like bending.
Great skill seems like clumsiness,
Great wisdom seems like folly.
Great eloquence seems like inarticulateness,
The wise do not speak.
The *Dao* is hidden and nameless,
Unseen yet named.
Only the *Dao* is good at lending itself and completing its work.
The *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.

**Chapter 42: The Chapter of *Dao* Transformation**

The *Dao* gives birth to the One,
And the world has a beginning—
It is the mother of the world.
The One gives birth to the Two,
And thus the ancient beginning is known.
The Two gives birth to the Three,
And the *Dao* gives birth to them.
The Three gives birth to all things,
And all things attain life by the One.
All things carry *yin* (阴) yet embrace *yang* (阳),
And the celestial gate opens and closes.
The *qi* (氣) mingles to form harmony.
Focus the *qi* to attain softness.
What people detest
Are *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂),
Yet kings and nobles take them as their titles.
Great achievement seems like a lack.
Thus, things may be diminished yet gain,
Or increased yet diminish—
They follow one another.
What people teach,
I also teach—
The *Dao* is the same as the *Dao*.
The strong and violent do not meet their end,
The stubborn and rigid are doomed to die.
I will use this as my teaching model,
So that the wise will not dare to act thus.

**Chapter 43: The Chapter of Partial Use**

The world’s most supple
Overcomes the world’s most rigid.
No substance is softer than water,
Yet in overcoming the rigid and strong,
None can surpass it.
It enters where there is no space.
The *Having* and *Non-Having* give birth to each other.
Thus, I know the benefit of *Non-Action* (无为).
Therefore, the Sage dwells in *Non-Action*.
Silent teaching, benefit through *Non-Action*—
Few in the world can attain it.
Those who know me are rare,
Those who follow me are honored.

**Chapter 44: The Chapter of Establishing Precepts**

What is closer to one’s name: one’s person or reputation?
One cannot grasp it to make close.
What is more abundant: one’s person or wealth?
One cannot seize it to make beneficial.
What brings greater harm: gain or loss?
To observe oneself with one’s person—
Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure,
And action leads to ruin.
Excessive hoarding brings great loss,
And grasping leads to loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no shame,
No disaster greater than not knowing sufficiency.
Knowing when to stop brings no peril,
And one may endure long.
Knowing this is why one does not perish.

**Chapter 45: The Chapter of Great *Virtue* (德)**

Great achievement seems like a lack,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
The highest *virtue* is not virtuous,
And thus it has *virtue*.
The greatest fullness seems like emptiness,
Yet its use is unending.
The *Dao* is empty yet used.
The greatest rectitude seems like bending,
And bending brings completeness.
Great skill seems like clumsiness,
Great purity seems like shame,
Great eloquence seems like inarticulateness,
The wise do not speak.
The *Dao*’s *qi* (氣) overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat—
*Non-Action* (无为) yet nothing remains ungoverned.
Clarity and purity establish order for the world.
If one does not desire stillness,
The world will self-correct.
If one does not desire frugality,
The world will self-correct.

**Chapter 46: The Chapter of Rejecting Desires**

When the world follows the *Dao*,
Horses are turned back to manure.
He who aids the sovereign with the *Dao*
Does not use arms to conquer the world.
When the world does not follow the *Dao*,
Warhorses arise in the suburbs.
Where the armies encamp,
Thorns and brambles grow.
No guilt is greater than desiring what one should not,
And excessive love brings great expenditure.

「Misfortune knows no greater cause than failing to know sufficiency—
Knowing when to stop brings no peril.
No fault surpasses the greed of acquisition.
What is gained and what is lost—
Which brings greater harm?
Thus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.
He who knows sufficiency is rich.

**Chapter 47: The Chapter of Discerning the Distant**

Without stepping beyond the door, one knows the world.
Without traveling, one knows the way.
Without peering through windows, one sees the *Dao*.
Subtle, mysterious, and far-reaching—
The farther one goes, the less one truly knows.
Excess leads to confusion.
Therefore, the Sage acts without traveling yet knows all,
Illuminated in every direction.
Unseen, yet named;
Without action, yet accomplished.
When deeds are done and affairs fulfilled,
The people say, *"It was as if by nature."*

**Chapter 48: The Chapter of Forgetting Knowledge**

In learning, one gains daily,
Yet the more one knows, the less one comprehends.
In the *Dao*, one diminishes daily—
The wise do not seek breadth.
Subtract again, subtract once more,
Until one reaches *Non-Action*.
Extreme emptiness attained,
*Non-Action* yet nothing remains undone.
To govern the world, one must act with *Non-Action*.
To rule with virtue, one must act with *Non-Action*.
When affairs arise, *Non-Action* is insufficient to govern the world.
In a disordered state, loyal ministers emerge.

**Chapter 49: The Chapter of Trusting in Virtue**

The Sage has no fixed heart—
He takes the people’s heart as his own.
With virtue as his measure,
He who is good, I make good;
He who is not good, I also make good—virtue is good.
All know goodness as goodness.
He who is trustworthy, I trust;
He who is untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue is trust.
All know beauty as beauty.
The Sage, dwelling in the world,
With reverence, blends his heart with the world—
The *Dao* flows vast.
The people fix their ears and eyes,
The common folk shine brightly.
The Sage treats them as children.
His virtue is profound, like that of an infant.
He cherishes life.

**Chapter 50: The Chapter of Valuing Life**

Birth and death, good and evil—
The ways of life are thirteenfold, the gentle and weak among them.
The ways of death are thirteenfold, the firm and strong among them.
Of the people, those who live
Move into death’s domain—thirteenfold as well.
He who does not cling to life is wiser than he who values it.
Why so?
Because his life is deeply nurtured.
The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive clinging to life—
Thus, they lightly court death.
It is said that those skilled in preserving life
Walk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,
Their virtue profound.
They enter battle without armor or weapons—»

「The blades of weapons find no place to strike.
Rhinoceroses have no place to thrust their horns,
Snatching birds do not attack.
Tigers have no place to extend their claws,
Fierce beasts do not seize.
The blades of weapons find no place to strike—
Heaven will rescue them,
Enfolding them with its **慈 (cī, benevolent mercy)**.
Why so?
Because there is no place where they may die.
Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
Always aligning with those of **德 (virtue/power)**.
**Chapter 51: The Chapter of Nurturing Virtue**

The Dao gives birth to them,
Virtue sustains them.
All things receive **一 (the One, fundamental essence)** to live.
Form shapes them,
Circumstance perfects them.
There is a primal substance, **混成 (hùnchéng, indistinctly formed)**,
Thus, all things cannot but revere the Dao and hold virtue dear.
The Dao is the profound mystery of all things.
The reverence of the Dao,
The esteem of virtue—
None command them yet they persist naturally.
The Dao follows **自然 (zìrán, self-so).
Thus, the Dao gives birth to them,
Virtue sustains them.
Holding fast to the ancient Dao,
It nurtures and fosters them,
Gives birth and sustains them.
It matures and perfects them,
The Dao gives birth to them.
It nourishes and shelters them,
With its aid, all things fulfill their natural course.
Born yet not possessed,
Acting yet not controlling,
Growing yet not reaping—
This is called **玄德 (Xuándé, profound virtue/power)**.
Heaven’s Dao is beneficial yet not harmful.

**Chapter 52: The Chapter of Returning to the Root**

The world has its beginning,
Which becomes the **母 (mother)** of the world.
There is a name for the **母 (mother)** of all things.
Once the mother is known,
Her offspring can be understood.
To know the ancient beginning—
Once the offspring are known,
Return and hold fast to the mother.
Each returns to its root,
And its life is never endangered.
Heaven endures, Earth persists.
Seal its **兑 (duì, mouth/opening)**,
Close its **门 (gates)**,
See no **可欲 (kěyù, desirable things)**,
And labor never ceases.
If lost, if hidden—
Open its **兑 (mouth/opening)**,
Accomplish its work,
The common folk scrutinize and probe,
Yet their lives are never saved.
Not the Dao’s fault, but their own.
Seeing the small as **明 (bright/clear)**,
The subtle and mysterious as **通 (passing through)**,
Holding to the gentle as **强 (strong)**,
The utmost harmony.
Using its **光 (radiance)**,
Returning to its **明 (brightness/essence)**—
Its use is never exhausted.
No harm befalls the body,
This is called **袭常 (xícháng, following constancy)**.
With this, one may have a nation.

**Chapter 53: The Chapter of Further Proof**」

When I am clear and knowing,
Walking the Great Dao,
My words are most easy to know,
Most easy to practice.
Yet people fear to apply them.

None under Heaven can know them,
None can practice them.
The Great Dao is most smooth,
Yet people love shortcuts.

Truthful words are not ornate.
Morning’s simplicity is most pure,
Yet great love brings great expense.
Fields grow overgrown,
Granaries lie empty,
Where armies march, thorns and brambles rise.

Fine silks and embroidery—
The adornment of the Dao,
Yet the beginning of folly.
Wearing sharp swords—
Fine weapons are ominous instruments.

Overindulging in food,
Five flavors dull the palate.
Excess wealth—
This is called thieving and boasting,
Not the Dao’s way.

Thus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

**Chapter 54: The Chapter of Cultivation and Observation**

Those who build well cannot be uprooted,
Standing firm and unchanging.
Those who embrace well do not slip,
Holding One, they cannot depart.
Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease—
The Way of long life and clear vision.

Cultivate it in the body,
Its virtue becomes true.
The Dao gives birth to it.
Cultivate it in the family,
Its virtue overflows—
Rich in contained virtue.
Cultivate it in the village,
Its virtue grows—
Virtue stored within.
Cultivate it in the state,
Its virtue flourishes.
Lords and kings who hold One
Set the world aright.
Cultivate it in the world,
Its virtue becomes universal.
The Great Dao is vast.

Thus, observing the body with the body,
Which is dearer—name or self?
Observing the family with the family,
Even with filial piety,
Six kinsmen may not harmonize.
Observing the village with the village,
Good and evil are revealed.
Observing the state with the state,
Even with loyal ministers,
The nation may be in chaos.
Observing the world with the world—
Therefore, those who value the self as the world
May entrust themselves to the world,
Those who love the self as the world
May commit themselves to the world.

How do I know the world is so?
By this.

---

Thus, the sage acts without doing yet knows.

**Chapter 55: The Mysterious Symbol**
The depth of virtue is like that of an infant.
Concentrating the *qi* to achieve supreme softness, one becomes like a babe.
Poisonous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not clutch,
Snatching birds do not seize.
Therefore, those who follow the Dao are unassailable.
Though bones are weak and sinews soft, their grip is firm.
Empty their heart, fill their belly.
Unknowing of the union of male and female yet their essence flows freely—this is the utmost refinement.
Thus, they merge into oneness.
Cry all day without hoarseness—this is the utmost harmony.
The Dao is boundless yet applied with precision.
Knowing harmony is constancy,
Knowing constancy is clarity—
This is called aligning with Heaven, the ancient ultimate.

To nurture life is auspicious,
Yet benefit comes from non-action.
When the heart commands the *qi*, it is strength.
Strengthening the bones,
Things grow robust yet age swiftly—
This is called *not* the Dao,
And the Dao *not* followed will perish early.
Thus, those who are rigidly strong are doomed to death.

**Chapter 56: The Mysterious Virtue**
The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.
Rare speech is natural.
Seal the senses,
Close the gates,
Do not see what is desirable.
Dull the sharpness,
Untangle the confusion—
Only by not contending does one avoid blame.
Blend their light with the dust,
Shine without dazzling—
This is called the Mysterious Unity.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao,
Thus, it cannot be grasped as near nor rejected as distant.
Desire not-desire,
Do not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth.
Cannot be gained for profit nor lost for harm.
Give birth yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely.
Cannot be prized nor debased—
Self-love without self-aggrandizement.
Thus, they are prized by the world.
Those who know me are rare,
Those who love me are precious.

**Chapter 57: Pure Transformation**
Govern with uprightness, not with cleverness—this is the nation’s blessing.
Use the unusual in warfare, govern with cleverness—this is the nation’s ruin.
To take the world by doing nothing,
The world is always taken by doing nothing.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
Observing the nation with the nation.
The world abounds with taboos,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
The people have many sharp tools,
Yet the state grows ever more chaotic.
Hard-to-obtain wealth makes men act deceitfully.
The people abound in cunning,
Yet strange things arise.
Wisdom emerges,
And great falsehoods proliferate.
Laws and decrees become more explicit,
And thieves and robbers multiply.
The world abounds with taboos,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
Therefore, the sage says:
I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves.
Hold the great pattern,
And the world will come of its own accord.
I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich.
Love the people, govern the state—
One can act without doing.
I favor tranquility, yet the people align themselves.
Act without acting,
And nothing remains ungoverned.
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.
The nameless simplicity,
Even this shall not be desired.

**Chapter 58: Following the Transformation**
When governance is dim and indistinct,
The people are sincere and earnest.
Govern with uprightness,
And governance is dim and indistinct.
When governance is scrutinizing and strict,
The people are frail and depleted.
Laws and decrees become more explicit,
And thieves and robbers multiply.
Calamity, where fortune leans,
May be lost to gain.
Fortune, where calamity lurks,
May be gained to lose.
Who knows its ultimate?
No one knows its ultimate.
Its rectitude and deviation are not fixed,
Nor is it because of its lack of partiality.
Rectitude becomes the unusual,
Goodness becomes the bizarre.
The Great Dao is most even,
Yet the people prefer narrow paths.
The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.
The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on a grand sacrifice.
Thus, the sage is square yet not rigid,
Modest yet not harmful,
Long yet not domineering,
Straight yet not overbearing,
Bright yet not dazzling—
The depth of their virtue.

**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**
To govern men and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses frugality.
Those who preserve this Dao,
Frugality is indeed called returning to the root.
Each returns to its root—
Returning to the root is called accumulating virtue early.
The Mysterious Virtue runs deep.
Accumulating virtue early,
Nothing it cannot overcome.
Its application is inexhaustible.
Its application is inexhaustible,
Nothing it cannot overcome—
No one knows its ultimate.
Its use cannot be fully realized.
No one knows its ultimate,
Yet one can have a state.
Thus, they can live long.
The mother of a state can endure long,
The Dao endures long—
This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,
Of long life and enduring vision.

**Chapter 60: The Enduring Dao**

**Chapter 61: The Dao of the Great and the Small**
To govern a great state as one would cook a small fish—
Its approach is gentle, its people content.
To rule the world with the Dao,
Its spirits are not dreaded.
The highest virtue does not claim virtue.
Not because its spirits are not dreaded,
But by harmonizing its brilliance.
Its brilliance does not harm people.
To love the people and govern the state—
Not because its brilliance does not harm people,
But by not daring to seize strength.
The Sage also does not harm people.
I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.
When both do not harm each other,
Their virtues naturally intertwine.
To grasp the Great Image,
The world will turn toward you.
The Sage who acts with humility—
This is the chapter on the virtue of humility.

The great state flows downward,
The great should naturally be low.
The world’s confluence—
Hollow, it fills.
The world’s receptive—
The receptive always overcomes the aggressive.
Know its aggression,
Hold to its receptivity.
To be low is to be still.
By its goodness in flowing downward,
It can become the sovereign of all things.
Thus, the great state submits to the small,
And takes the small.
Not boasting, it endures long.
The small state submits to the great,
And is taken by the great.
To bend is to remain whole.
Sometimes one submits to take,
And victory belongs to those who do.
Sometimes one submits and takes.
The Dao follows nature.
The great state does not seek to devour others,
But to nurture all things without claiming lordship.
The small state does not seek to serve others,
But to serve well what it can.
These two fulfill their own desires.
Their approach is one in harmony.
The great should naturally be low.
Those who excel in using others should be low.
This is the chapter on the Dao of the Way.

**Chapter 62: The Dao’s Hidden Depth**
The Dao is the hidden essence of all things,
All things honor the Dao and value virtue.
The treasure of the good person—
Heaven gains the One and remains clear.
The refuge of the unworthy—
The Dao gives life, virtue sustains it.
Fine words can be sold,
Yet the Sage does not hoard them.
The more he gives to others, the more he possesses.
Noble deeds can be bestowed upon people,
Ever aiding them in goodness.
The Sage’s constant practice is to rescue people.
Why should the unworthy be abandoned?
Thus, the good person is the teacher of the unworthy.
Therefore, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven
And appoints the Three Exalted Ministers—
This is the way of the Sage.
Though one has a jade tablet to precede four horses,
It is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao.
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.
The ancients prized this Dao because it was profound—
Profound yet more profound.
Why must one daily seek to obtain it,
Or use guilt to avoid evil?
Knowing this, one will not falter.
Thus, it is prized above all by the world.
The Dao’s exalted worth—
This is the chapter on the beginning of grace.

---

**Chapter 63: The Dao of Non-Action**
To act without action,
The benefits of non-action—
Few in the world can attain them.
To manage without managing,
I manage nothing, yet the people grow rich.
To taste without savoring,
The Dao’s emergence is as plain as water.
Great or small, many or few,
Repay resentment with virtue.
Virtue sustains them.
To attempt the difficult in its ease,
Many easy things will lead to difficulty.
To achieve the great in its smallness,
A tree thick enough to embrace—
It grows from a tiny sprout.
The world’s great difficulties must arise from the small.
The difficult and the easy form each other.
The world’s great undertakings must arise from the minute.
If I were to know this clearly,
And walk the Great Dao,
Then the Sage would never claim to be great,
Yet could accomplish the great.
Not boasting, it endures long.
Light promises will surely lack trust,
Not knowing what is known as illness.
Many easy things will lead to difficulty—
Fine words are very easy to know,
Very easy to act upon,
Yet the world cannot know them,
Cannot act upon them.
Thus, the Sage finds them difficult.
Hence, he will never face difficulty.
The world’s great difficulties must arise from the ease.
This is the chapter on guarding subtlety.

---

**Chapter 64: The Dao of Simplicity**
Its tranquility is easy to maintain,
Serenity is the highest state.
Its signs are easy to discern before they appear,
Act upon them before they exist.
Its fragility is easy to break,
Firmness and strength are the doom of things.
Its subtlety is easy to disperse.
To practice the Dao is to daily diminish.
Act upon them before they exist,
Govern before they are disordered.
Thus, the Sage acts below and knows above.
A tree thick enough to embrace—
It grows from a tiny sprout.
The world’s great undertakings must arise from the small.
A nine-tiered tower—
It begins with piled earth.
High labor must be founded on the low.
A thousand-li journey—
It starts beneath one’s feet.
To achieve the great from the small.
Those who act will ruin it,
Those who grasp will lose it.
If one would take it away,
One must first firmly give it.
The Sage acts without acting,
Thus he never ruins;
He does not grasp,
Thus he never loses.
To act without acting.
The people’s undertakings—
Often fail just as they near completion.
Those who act will ruin it.
To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,
Then there will be no ruined undertakings.
To guard is to be firm.
Thus, the Sage desires not to desire,
Does not prize hard-to-obtain goods.
Not desiring what shines like jade,
Not learning what is already learned—
Returning to what others have passed over.
Dwelling in substance, not in its splendor,
Aiding the natural self-sufficiency of all things,
Daring not to act.
The Dao is ever without action.
This is the chapter on pure virtue.

「To cherish oneself is not to prize oneself.
Thus, the world delights in promoting him without being weary of it.
All know beauty when they see it—
Because he does not vie, none can vie with him.
Only he who does not vie
Is free from blame.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven on the Three Treasures**
The world all says my Dao is great,
Yet appears unworthy.
Brightness without brilliance—
If it shines like jade,
Its refinement has long since faded.
The Dao is a thing
Of vague and hazy form.

I have three treasures:
Treasure them and hold them fast.
Give birth and do not possess,
Act and do not rely upon,
Grow and do not dominate.
The first is *cí* (慈, compassion/kindness),
The second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality),
The third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, daring not to lead the world).

I have these three treasures:
Compassion makes one brave,
Guarding softness is strength.
Frugality brings abundance,
Abandoning extravagance.
Daring not to lead the world,
Thus one can perfect the vessel and endure long.

Not daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—
Now abandon humility and take the lead,
Death awaits.
The obstinate will not know their end.
Compassion in battle brings victory,
Softness overcomes hardness.
To hold fast is to be steadfast.
Those who preserve this Dao—
Heaven shall rescue them,
With compassion as their shield.
Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,
Always aiding the virtuous.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight on Aligning with Heaven**
The virtuous scholar is not martial,
Assisting the ruler with the Dao,
Not relying on arms to subdue the world.
The skilled warrior does not rage,
Softness overcomes strength.
The wise victor does not vie,
Yielding preserves wholeness.
The good leader serves below,
Greatness lies in serving below.
This is called the virtue of non-vying,
Weakening one’s resolve.
This is called the strength of using others,
Knowing people is wisdom.
This is called aligning with Heaven,
The ancient ultimate.
Holding fast to the ancient Dao,
Mysterious and effective.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine on Employing the Mysterious**
There are words on wielding arms:
Thus, those who establish them have been.
I dare not be host but guest,
Knowing honor and guarding disgrace.
Not daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—
Abandoning humility and taking the lead,
Death awaits.
This is called *no action yet action* (行无行),
*no arms yet arms* (攘无臂),
*no enemies yet enemies* (仍无敌),
*no weapons yet weapons* (执无兵).
Thus, the good are merely fruitful.
No greater calamity than scornful of the enemy,
Life or name—what is more dear?
Scornful of the enemy nearly loses my treasures.
No greater fault than desiring gain.
Thus, when armies clash,
The sorrowful shall prevail.
Hence, arms strong yet not victorious.
Knowing difficulty,

**Chapter Seventy on Ignorance**
My words are easy to know,
Easy to act upon.
The Great Dao is smooth and simple.
Yet the world cannot know it,
Cannot act upon it.
The people are bewildered.

Words have their root,
Affairs have their master.
The *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage) knows these.
Only because of ignorance
Do they not know me.
Self-knowing yet not self-displaying—
Few know me,
Many know me and are confused.
Those who truly know me are honored.
The Dao’s reverence.
Thus, the Sage wears coarse robes yet harbors jade.
Brightness without brilliance—
If it shines like jade,
Its refinement has long since faded.
Knowing sickness,

**Chapter Seventy-One on Knowing Sickness**
Knowing the unknown is superior,
Not self-displaying is clarity.
Not knowing yet knowing is sickness.
Self-displaying is not clarity.
Only because of knowing sickness,
Thus one is not sick.
Advancing the Dao is like retreating.
The Sage is not sick,
Because he knows sickness,
Thus he is not sick.
Great virtue seems insufficient.»

**Chapter Seventy-Two on Loving Oneself**
The people do not fear great threats,
When great threats arrive.
Not knowing constancy,
Recklessly creating calamity.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
Empty their hearts.
Do not weary of what they produce,
Circulate freely without peril.
Only because of not wearying,
Thus one is not weary.
The good at embracing do not fall away.
Thus, the Sage knows himself yet does not display,
Smooths the Dao like common clay.
Cherishes himself yet does not prize himself.
Highest virtue is not virtue.
Hence, abandon that and take this,
Opposite to nature.
Tasking the world,

**Chapter Seventy-Three on Tasking the World**
Brave yet daring brings death,
The obstinate are doomed.
Brave yet not daring brings life,
The gentle endure.
These two—
One benefits, one harms.
Good and evil.
What Heaven abhors,
Who knows its cause?

There are always those who wield death.
Thus, the Sage fears it still.
Only the *shī* (施, benevolent) are to be feared.
Heaven’s Dao,
Does not vie yet prevails,
Follows nature.
Does not speak yet responds well,
Silent yet natural.
Does not summon yet comes,
Acts opportunely.
Quiet yet well-plotted,
Affairs well-executed.
Heaven’s net vast and wide,
Loose yet never misses.
What Heaven abhors,
Who knows its cause?
**Chapter Seventy-Four on Restraining Confusion**
The people do not fear death,
How can one frighten them with death?
The people do not fear great threats,
When great threats arrive.
If one makes the people always fear death,
Then even the wise will not dare act.
Yet those who act strangely,
Invite their own blame.
I grasp them and kill them—
Who dares?
Brave yet daring brings death.
There are always those who wield death.
Ruling the world with the Dao—
To wield death in place of Heaven’s decree,
Is like a substitute carpenter taking the master’s axe.
Not knowing yet knowing is sickness.
To wield death in place of Heaven’s decree,
Few do not injure their hands.
Their affairs return to them.
**Chapter Seventy-Five on Greed and Loss**
...

**Chapter Seventy-Six on Overbearing Constraints**
The people’s hunger comes from their rulers exacting too many taxes.
Thus, the more taboos and prohibitions there are, the poorer the people become.
The people are hard to govern because their rulers act too much.
The more laws and edicts are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits there are.
The people treat death lightly because their desire for life is so great.
When the people’s craving for life leads them into perilous paths,
Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who value it.
The Dao is ever without action.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven on Heaven’s Way**
Heaven’s Way—is it not like drawing a bow?
The ancients who excelled in the Dao
suppressed the high and raised the low,
used the Way’s emptiness to act.
To those with excess, they took away;
to those lacking, they gave.
Thus, taking away benefits them,
and giving benefits them as well.
Heaven’s Way is to reduce excess and supplement deficiency.
Empty their minds, fill their bellies.
Human ways are not so.
They give to those lacking to serve those who have.
Those who lose are the same as those who gain.
Who can gain excess to serve the world?
Only those who follow the Dao.

The Sage does not hoard,
yet the more they give, the more they have.
Thus, the Sage acts yet does not rely on it.
Heaven and Earth are not kind;
they treat all things as fodder for the sacrificial altar.
When the work is done yet no credit is taken,
this is the Sage’s humility.
Great completion seems like a flaw.
**Chapter Seventy-Eight on Trusting in Faith**

**Chapter Seventy-Seven on Water’s Way**
The world has nothing softer nor weaker than water,
yet nothing better for the Dao than water.
Yet in overcoming hardness and strength,
none know its power to prevail.
Softness overcomes hardness—
there is nothing to replace it.
The world has nothing softer nor weaker than water,
thus softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength,
and softness-weakness overcomes hardness-strength.
Yet none can know it,
none can act in accordance with it.
Can one truly not know it?

**Chapter Seventy-Nine on Trusting in Virtue**

Thus the Sage says:
*"To bear the filth of the state—*
this is called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.
*To know the constant and embrace it,*
this is called the public Virtue.
*To bear the misfortunes of the state—*
this is to be the King of the World.
*To dwell where the multitude abhors,*
thus one approaches the Dao.
*Straight speech seems like perversion.*

The mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,
yet it opposes all things.
**Chapter Eighty on the Way of the Daoist**

*To reconcile great grudges,*
there must remain some grudge—
how can this be called good?
*Great and small, many and few,*
repay grudges with Virtue.
Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
yet does not blame others.

The Sage is not kind,
for he treats the people as fodder for the sacrificial altar.
Thus one with Virtue governs contracts,
while the Daoist aligns with the Dao.
Without Virtue, one cannot penetrate,
for the Dao is ever without action.

The Way of Heaven has no favorites,
yet it always sides with the Virtuous.
The Virtuous, I Virtue them.
**Chapter Eighty-One on Simplicity and Authenticity**

Faithful words are not ornate,
ornate words are not faithful.
The faithful, I believe them,
yet I also believe the unfaithful.

The good do not argue,
the argumentative are not good.
The good, I Virtue them,
yet I also Virtue the ungood.

The wise are not learned,
the learned are not wise.
Few things bring clarity,
many things bring confusion.
The Sage does not hoard,
yet the more he gives to others, the more he has.
He is always good at saving others.
The more he gives to things, the more he possesses.
The Way of Heaven benefits yet does not harm.
The Dao is honored.
The Sage’s Way acts yet does not contend.
Virtue is precious.
