### The Sacrificial Ox of the Grand Temple
The writings of Zhuang Zhou are but allegories; those who scrutinize his words without grasping their intent are the very ones who dispute his meaning. Zhuang Zhou said: "Above, one must act without contrivance to employ the world; below, one must act with purpose to be employed by the world." Yet he deemed himself dwelling amid benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, thus exhausting his talents without revealing them. Who would claim that Zhuang Zhou’s words cannot be applied to the relations between ruler and minister, father and son? Yet in his time, he could never have been made to act.

When he invoked the sacrificial ox of the Grand Temple to decline the Chu envoy’s invitation, he was merely using stark words to rebuff the mediocrities of a declining age. With Zhuang Zhou’s talent, how could he have been so deluded about the path of withdrawal as to fear only the ox? Rather, he was one of those whom Confucius called "recluses who speak freely." Zhuang Zhou was likely such a man.

### The *Spring and Autumn* as a Mirror of the Age
The sage engages in discourse but not debate; the various masters debate but do not discourse. Discourse is exposition and nothing more; discussion is evaluation and nothing more; debate is the weighing of right and wrong in affairs. Beyond the Six Directions, the sage leaves matters unaddressed. Within the Six Directions, the sage discourses but does not discuss.

The sage’s discourse is evident in the *Spring and Autumn*, which discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn*’s record of the age is merely discussion. The sage’s discussion is not by choice—how could it resemble the common folk, who vie to debate and display themselves?

### Shade Asks Shadow
In Zhuangzi’s text, the shade twice questions the shadow. The shadow, though seemingly dependent on form, is in truth not so. Yet the ignorant assume that rising, sitting, bowing, and lifting depend on form—how could they know that the shadow does not truly rely on form?

To insist that the shadow depends on form, and form on the Creator, is to fail to comprehend spontaneous transformation. One who grasps spontaneous transformation knows that the shadow does not depend on form, nor form on the Creator—it culminates in nothingness. Thus it is said: "How could one know why it is so or not so?"

### Dreaming of a Butterfly
Zhuangzi spoke of dreaming of a butterfly to express his contentment, and of fish to express his joy. The butterfly, small and fluttering, goes everywhere without hindrance; the fish, dwelling in the depths, preserves its life. Through these two creatures, he conveyed his sense of ease and delight, harmonizing all things in their diversity.

### Goblet Words
Goblet words are speech without fixed form.

Words without unity flow forth endlessly, thus called "daily arising." Speech that lacks unity yet emerges must have a root, hence "harmonized with Heaven’s boundary." Heaven’s boundary is the wondrous root of spontaneity. Words rooted thus respond to change without limit, hence "following the manifold." Words that respond to change without limit transcend the bounds of past and present, yet my speech knows no end—thus "exhausting the years." Though Zhuang Zhou’s words may seem unbounded and diverse, they never depart from the root of the Dao. Thus Guo Xiang deemed him one who knew the root, for he understood Zhuangzi’s depth.

### Miscellaneous Sayings
What all things follow is the Dao. The Dao is that which things follow, yet it is nowhere absent. Thus, in greatness it never exceeds, and in minuteness it never omits. Each of the myriad things possesses its nature and capacity, which is why Zhuang Zhou’s writings speak of the kun and peng, the cicada and fledgling dove, the quail and wren, the ant and sheep, the fish and butterfly, the horse and ox, the mountain trees, and the like.

The root of the Dao lies before the Great Ultimate yet is not lofty; its foundation rests beneath the Six Poles yet is not deep. Before heaven and earth existed, it preceded their birth yet was not ancient. From antiquity it has endured, older than high antiquity yet not long-lived. The diversity of the ten thousand things is called abundance; unifying diversity is called greatness; possessing abundance is called great enterprise—this is the sage.

Only after form exists does name arise; only after name exists does division arise; only after division exists does adherence arise. Zhuangzi said: "Once form and name are clear, adherence follows." Zhuangzi’s meaning—that one does not break Mo Ye blades, nor resent flying tiles, nor rage at empty boats—is the same.

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright laws yet do not debate; the ten thousand things have completed principles yet do not explain. Thus Confucius wished to be wordless, saying: "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born." Who but one who embodies the Dao could attain this?

Following one’s nature is spontaneity; cultivating the Dao is contrivance. Spontaneity is Heaven; contrivance is man. What lies within spontaneity exists; what lies beyond contrivance does not. How can man take away what one has or add what one lacks? Thus, what one has is nature; what one lacks is what Zhuangzi called excess.

Virtue is what one possesses. To add to what one already possesses is excess. Thus it is said: "The joined toes and extra fingers arise from nature yet are excessive in virtue. The hanging wens and dangling tumors arise from form yet are excessive in nature."

The traces of the noble man may be limited or boundless, but the Dao of the sage knows no dullness or sharpness—this is what the people perceive. The noble man’s traces may be limited or boundless, yet his heart knows no difference between them. Thus it is said: "Whether limited or boundless, one is joyful, for limitation and boundlessness are like the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain."

Zhuangzi said: "Do not let the artificial destroy the Mandate." The human Dao is called the artificial; the Heavenly Dao is called the Mandate. The Dao is like the year; the sage is like the seasons. Thus Zhuang Zhou composed *Autumn Floods* to speak of "the time arriving"—it is simply being timely. Yet petty scholars point to this and criticize it, no wonder they resent the summer insect’s inability to speak of ice or the well-frog’s inability to speak of the sea.

Zhuangzi said: "Yan Hui has forgotten benevolence and righteousness, yet has not yet forgotten ritual and music." Benevolence and righteousness are forgotten first, ritual and music later—this implies benevolence and righteousness are not as profound as ritual and music. Here Zhuangzi first speaks of forgetting the inner, then the outer: benevolence and righteousness are inner, yet the outer—ritual and music—has not been forgotten. Only when inner and outer are forgotten can one attain "sitting in forgetfulness." This is why his words differ.

The sage takes the necessary as unnecessary; the multitude takes the unnecessary as necessary. What does this mean? The great man’s words need not be reliable, his actions need not be resolute—this is taking the necessary as unnecessary. To insist that words be reliable and actions resolute is to take the unnecessary as necessary.

Some of Zhuangzi’s words resemble those of sages and worthies; they cannot be entirely dismissed. The sage does not establish intent, yet intent always remains; does not assert the self, yet the self always exists. Moved only under compulsion, rising only when unavoidable—this is not acting with intent, not rising with self-assertion, but simply responding.

Zhuangzi said: "That which things things is not thinged by things," which aligns with Xunzi’s words: "One refined in the Dao things things." Stillness is the root; movement is the branch. The sage is one who is still and constant with things, moving and responsive to them. The multitude is one who is still and detached from things, moving and entangled with them. The sage things things; the multitude is thinged by things—this is the difference.

Confucius said: "The noble man studies to attain the Dao." Zhuang Zhou said: "The Dao cannot be attained." Confucius said: "As virtue, the *Doctrine of the Mean* is supreme." Zhuang Zhou said: "Virtue cannot be reached." Why? Confucius spoke of what lies in man; Zhuang Zhou spoke of what lies in Heaven. If it lies in Heaven, how can the spontaneous Dao be attained? How can the self-possessed virtue be reached? If it lies in man, how can the profound Dao be attained? How can the ever-renewing virtue be reached? Only one who can attain may then not attain; only one who can reach may then not reach.

Zhuangzi’s writings delve into the mysteries of nature and destiny, unify the scattered threads of virtue and the Dao, aiming to dispel obscurity and replace it with clarity. Thus arise the teachings of returning to the root and restoring the Mandate, the words of smashing the bushel and breaking the scales.

Yet when the Dao resides in the heart and converges in the mind, inquiry into the Dao meets no response—what need is there for words?

For though silence may suffice to encompass the subtleties of the Dao, without speech there is no means to clarify it. Thus, only when compelled does one arise; only when moved does one act; only when pressed does one respond. Then, mounting the chariot of discourse, one bears the teachings onward, that scholars may grasp the meaning and forget the image, grasp the image and forget the words—this too is where Zhuangzi’s intent diverges from the world.

Zhuangzi speaks of the marsh pheasant confined in a pen, for it has lost its true nature. The perfected ones of antiquity could forget their cunning minds, still their external cares, align their hearts with the Great Void, and harmonize the Dao with the convergence of yin and yang. They took heaven and earth as a single morning, and distant ages as a single storehouse. None were deemed strange, so things could neither draw near nor grow distant—thus they emerged beyond all bounds, unlike the marsh pheasant trapped within its pen.

Zhuangzi said: "The true person of old erred without regret, and when right did not rejoice"—this shows that even sages are not without fault. To err without self-reproach is to be as one with Heaven. If one were to err as others do, there would be correction and no reluctance to change, and all would look up to such a one. Winter’s warmth and summer’s chill are Heaven and Earth’s errors—if even Heaven and Earth may err, how much more the sage?

Great fear is called dread; small fear is called anxiety. Zhuangzi said: "Great dread is boundless; small anxiety is fretful." Zhuangzi’s writings penetrate the divisions of nature and destiny without allowing life and death, fortune and misfortune to disturb the heart. This is what brings him near to the sage—only one of luminous wisdom can attain such clarity. Reading the words of the sages may suffice to reach this, but failing to do so and sinking into Zhuang Zhou’s teachings instead would lead to great confusion.

The night’s qi endures when the myriad cares are stilled. If it does not settle and endure, one cannot attain morning clarity; to attain morning clarity is to return to the root of virtue. That which surpasses the sage and animates the myriad things is spirit; that which shares the sorrows of the myriad things is sageliness. Spirit without sageliness cannot act; sageliness without action cannot conceal.

Zhuang Zhou’s words exalt spirit and demean sageliness—this is an overcorrection of error. Zhuangzi said: "From its root, from its source." The root is one, lying beneath the tree. The source is where the tree halts beside *gen*. The root emerges from the source, and the source clings to the root—they depend on each other to grow. Thus, the root is destiny, and the source is nature. Laozi said: "Returning to the root is called stillness"—this speaks of nature. "Stillness is called returning to destiny"—this speaks of the root.

In Zhuangzi’s writings, there are references to the true person and the perfected person: "true" speaks of their nature, while "perfected" speaks of the utmost in the human Dao. Clarity is the dispersion of spirit; spirit is the concealment of clarity. Thus, clarity arises from what spirit brings about, and so it is said that clarity cannot surpass spirit. Laozi said: "The gate of Heaven opens and closes." Zhuangzi said: "The gate of Heaven has no existence." Because the myriad things emerge from it, it is called "opening and closing"; because the myriad things are concealed within it, it is called "nonexistence."

Zhuangzi’s words on the "boundless deep" refer to that which has no end, and beyond that, no end. The myriad things flourish and take form within it, so their limits cannot be seen. The myriad things are complete within heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth have no intention toward them—thus it is said: "Great completeness." None is like heaven and earth, yet what do they seek? And yet they are greatly complete. The myriad things are also complete within my own body, yet I do not externally labor for them—thus it is said: "One who knows great completeness seeks nothing." Being thus, one attains the Dao without loss and does not abandon it. How could one forsake the self to chase after things? Thus it is said: "Lose nothing, discard nothing, do not exchange the self for things."

Zhuangzi said: "There are names and realities—these are the dwellings of things." This means that in substance, it is substance; in function, it is function—this is how the myriad things arise. "Without name or reality" refers to the emptiness within things, where what is neither heard nor seen must gather in the void. What can be spoken or conceived only grows more distant; what is wordless and inconceivable is how the Dao draws near.

Zhuang Zhou’s writings convey the subtleties of the Dao, for his words seek to save nature and destiny before their dispersion and to awaken the world from its vulgar customs—how could this not be rooted in the Dao? The Dao is the sea; the sage is the hundred rivers. The Dao is the year; the sage is the seasons. Though the hundred rivers differ, what they share is the sea. Though the four seasons differ, what they share is the year. Though the Ways of Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi adapt to different times, in essence, do they not all return to this? To read Zhuangzi’s writings, seeking their meaning while forgetting their words—this may be called skillful reading.
