**Memorial on the Daoist Teachings of Military Strategy**
To His Excellency the Emperor, the Right Minister [Wang Zhen] respectfully presents this memorial. The humble subject, prostrating himself, dares to submit that Your Majesty’s most noble and enlightened wisdom is able to heed the sincerity of Your subject’s humble words. If it pleases Your Majesty to hear of this, then Your subject, though of lowly nature and limited understanding, having long served in the military administration yet never having the honor of attending court, has been graciously pardoned by Your Majesty’s singular benevolence and elevated to this weighty office. Within four years, Your subject has twice been entrusted with the governance of a frontier state, yet despite the Emperor’s ceaseless labor for the people, the suffering of the common folk remains unrelieved, and the burdens of the realm persist. Though Your subject’s face is unworthy, he has long basked in Your Majesty’s favor, day and night striving with trembling fear, yet having no place to turn. Your subject often reflects upon his feeble strength and dull wit, unable to contribute meaningfully, his life too insignificant to repay Your Majesty’s grace. In retreat, he cannot atone for his failures; in advancement, he only seeks to be loyal. Thus, he humbly offers these crude insights, hoping they may aid in some small measure.

As for the **Dao** of Heaven above, the **virtue/power** (德) of humanity within, and the **principles** (理) of Earth below, Your subject has striven to exhaust his sincerity as a filial son, hoping to repay the benevolence of Your Majesty and the virtues of Your fatherly reign. The *Odes* (《诗》) are three hundred in number, yet their essence lies in **uprightness** (无邪); the *Sutra* (经) contains five thousand words, yet its **principles** (理) must ultimately return to **self-cultivation** (自正).

Your subject submits that Your Majesty, embodying the **Dao/Way** (道), governs as a sovereign, and through **non-action** (无为) brings peace to the realm, such that since Your ascension, all under Heaven have prospered in tranquility. Even lands where the sun and moon do not shine are still reached by Your Majesty’s teachings, and territories where the frost and dew are uneven still receive Your grace. Punishments are applied with fairness, and none suffer wrongfully; arms are laid down, yet none are raised again. **Non-action** (无为) and **non-interference** (无事) reign supreme—though the world may call it rest, it is no mere cessation of labor. The people rejoice in harmony, and all under Heaven are fortunate indeed.

Thus, Your subject, though reckless and unrefined, dares to submit the following two volumes of *The Essential Principles of War as Elucidated in the *Daodejing*** (《論兵要義述》), now divided into four volumes, along with accompanying memorials. Though his work may be crude and incomplete, he humbly presents it in earnest hope. Your subject prays that Your Majesty’s sacred benevolence may shine upon this offering, and that You deign to grant favor, placing it before the assembled ministers for their scrutiny. May Your Majesty’s wisdom pierce through its flaws, and then Your subject will gladly withdraw to his death in obscurity, a fate he embraces. With blood and sincerity, he awaits Your judgment, overwhelmed with gratitude and dread. At this moment of utmost reverence, Your subject respectfully entrusts his subordinate, the General of the Vanguard Shang Chu (尚璀), to deliver this memorial in its proper seal, and humbly presents it.

Respectfully submitted.
On the seventh day of the seventh month, the fourth year of the Yuanhe era.

**Imperial Edict**

The Emperor commands Wang Zhen and Shang Chu to attend at the palace. All that you have submitted has been fully examined.

Your duty lies in the governance of the realm, and your sincerity is meant to aid and supplement. Rooted in the principles of **Dao** and **virtue**, drawing upon the sources of **li** (rites) and **hua** (transformation), you delve into the profound and subtle, producing this treatise. Upon reviewing it, I am deeply moved by its excellence.

Now that autumn’s chill has come, I trust you remain in good health. I have sent no word, lest it be too frequent.

**The Twenty-Ninth Day**

**Memorial from Wang Zhen:**

Your subject has heard that in ancient times, **Fuxi** (Regulator of All) received the **Dao** from Heaven and Earth, ordering all things, yet still deemed the **Way** insufficient. Thus, he sat in silent contemplation, refining the essence until his wisdom resonated through the cosmos. Yet Heaven speaks not and yet gives life, Earth speaks not and yet nurtures—thus the **Yellow River** bore the **Dragon Scriptures**, the **Lu River** the **Turtle Classics**, revealing their patterns.

From this, the **Eight Trigrams** were drawn, and writing was established.

When wisdom first emerged and true simplicity faded, even writing proved inadequate. Thus, the **August Sovereign, the Primordial Emperor**, was born to replace Heaven and Earth in speech, to rectify their flaws.

Hence, the **Five Thousand Words** were composed with earnest care, their meaning profound and moving. They may be said to open the roots of **Dao** and **virtue**, severing the branches of mere speech. Compared to literature, they shine like the three luminaries in the sky; akin to movement and growth, they fill the earth with all things. In their teachings, all virtues are fully realized in humanity.

What is called **"li"** (rites) is the origin of disorder—for disorder is but another form of order. Without **"li"**, disorder cannot be rectified, hence it is called the "origin of disorder."

**Wen** (culture) is the sovereign of **wu** (martial force), while **wu** is the defense of **wen**. These two powers operate in tandem, ever-present, one on the left, one on the right. Neither can be neglected, for it is said: *"To forget war is perilous; to love war is ruin."* Thus, war may be used but not indulged in, waged but not forgotten.

From **Huangdi** (Yellow Emperor) onward, who used arms to suppress chaos, down to the **Xia Dynasty**, no age lacked war. Even the **Three Sovereigns**, though virtuous, relied on arms to unify the world. Their wars were waged only when necessary, and once concluded, the arms were laid down, never to be used again.

Yet succeeding rulers—some arrogant, some perverse, some cruel, some licentious, some wrathful, some greedy, some vain, some jealous—turned their own people into enemies, always seeking strength, always demanding victory. Exhausted and reckless, they fought without cease, either burning themselves out or consuming all until annihilation. They spilled the blood of the people, indulged their own fury, poisoned the land, and brought calamity to all. Thus, the **Dao**-governed ruler, though pained by this, could not abolish war entirely, and so used it reluctantly.

The **Dao**-governed ruler’s way of wielding arms is not out of anger, not for contention, not for greed, nor for vengeance. Rather, they organize and regulate, store and conceal, ensuring the unvirtuous are restrained and the unruly are subdued—not for battle, not for slaughter, not for hunting, not for aggression. This is the profound intent of the **Dao**-governed ruler’s use of arms.

Anger defies **virtue**; arms are instruments of calamity; contention is what all detest. To wield calamity with defiance, to act against what all abhor—how could this be easy? Hence it is said: *"The ruler of supreme **virtue** is followed by all under Heaven; the ruler of supreme benevolence is followed by all within the seas; the ruler of supreme righteousness is followed by all within the state; the ruler of supreme **li** is followed by all within the neighborhood."* Without these four **virtues**, none will follow.

If none follow and war is used, then war is the path to peril. Thus, arms are called *"the ominous instrument,"* and *"the death ground."*

Therefore, the **Dao**-governed ruler must first cultivate **Dao** and **virtue** and only then consider arms.

Moreover, your subject has heard: Founding rulers perish to complete their deeds; succeeding rulers must endure to preserve their legacy. Thus, the **Dao**-governed ruler, knowing that necessity may demand arms, yet strives to make their use unnecessary. The common ruler, however, clings to necessity and thus war proliferates. Hence, the **Five Thousand Words** were not merely for the rulers of their time but also as a warning to future sovereigns against reckless warfare.

Thus, the **Five Thousand Words** first expound on the **Way** of supreme **virtue**, the essentials of self-cultivation and governance, the affairs of **wuwei** (non-action), and the teachings of **non-speech**, only later addressing war. Yet every chapter subtly returns to the subject of arms.

Why? Because the **Dao**-governed ruler descended into the late **Shang Dynasty**, when warfare arose among the feudal lords. At that time, the **Way** of the **Five Constants** had long been lost. Unable to speak plainly, the text instead extols the **Way** of emptiness and non-contention, the **virtue** of gentleness and humility, as a warning.

Contention is the root of war, the origin of calamity. The **Dao**-governed ruler sought to extinguish this root and sever this origin. Thus, throughout the text, the emphasis repeatedly returns to *"non-contention."*

Only through non-contention can war be averted, only through non-contention can battle arrays be avoided. Hence, the **Dao**-governed ruler’s words are deeply sincere, their meaning profound—profound indeed.

Heaven and Earth speak not, yet their transformations are unfathomable. Thus, the **Dao**-governed ruler named them and established writing, so that humanity might know and follow. This is not difficult to understand, nor difficult to practice. How much more so for our dynasty, which inherits **Dao** from its ancestors and **virtue** from its forebears, tracing its lineage to the **Sage Kings** and the **Dao**-transcendent source? Its glory is beyond compare, its majesty beyond measure.

May the **Enlightened and Sage Emperor**, our Sovereign, whose wisdom and virtue are boundless, whose reverence and humility are profound—who penetrates the radiance of the **Ten Thousand Leaves** and transmits the **Billions of Threads** of the **Dao**, who clarifies the **Way** of the **August Sovereign** and nurtures all things, who expands the **virtue** of the **Son of Heaven** and upholds the **Hundred Measures**—who sits in stillness yet transforms all, who lays down arms before they are raised, who repels battle before it is joined—who practices **wuwei** and **non-action**, embodying supreme **virtue** and benevolence—who values the **Five Thousand Words** above all and despises the **Hundred Perils** of war—who governs with the **knotted cords** of **Dao**, whose great transformation benefits all living beings—whose reign inspires the songs of the tillers, whose **virtue** is sung by the common folk—may all under Heaven rejoice, may all under Heaven rejoice.

**The Dao That Can Be Spoken, Chapter One**

Your subject, from youth, has dabbled in the **Dao** of the **Rujia** (儒业), yet in adulthood lacks martial prowess. Beholding the **ascendant peace** (升平) in times of **profound prosperity** (明盛), and relying upon the **nurturing virtue** (亭育) within the **domain of benevolent longevity** (仁寿), thus it is that Your subject, though unworthy and obscure, dares to presume upon the words of the **Sages** (圣人), willingly risking the punishment of the **cauldron and boiling pot** (鼎镬之诛), and humbly offering the **merest fragments of counsel** (刍荛之志).

Your subject prostrates himself, considering the **Daoist Classics** (道德经) and their **texts** (经文), with **He Gong** (河公) elucidating their meaning from afar, **Yan Shi** (严氏) pointing to their essence in the midst, and **Kaiyuan** (开元) annotating their interpretations in recent times. Though Your subject is reckless and unrefined, how dare he wield words?

Now, what Your subject speaks of is solely the **essentials of warfare** (兵战之要), gleaning from the **profound mysteries** (玄微), and thus records the **chapter titles** (章首) from the *Daoist Classic* as headings, arranged as follows: beneath each heading, Your subject roughly expounds the **holy decrees** (圣旨) of the **Emperor of Profound Origin** (玄元皇帝), sometimes beginning with the **Classic** (经) to set forth the matter, sometimes concluding with it to complete the meaning. Though his reasoning is flawed and his understanding limited—like peering through a tube—he lacks the **hundred-percent accuracy** (百中之能) yet hopes to achieve **one ten-thousandth of fairness** (万分之一). Hence, he names this work *The Daoist Classic’s Essentials of Warfare and Its Explication* (《道德论兵要义述》), its language crude and vulgar, tarnishing the **august and solemn** (宸严). Without measure, Your subject stands in deepest **trepidation and self-reproach** (惶惧战越), and thus humbly speaks.

**Volume One of the *Daoist Classic’s Essentials of Warfare and Its Explication***
Presented by Your subject, **Wang Zhen** (王真), a **Chief Attendant of the Court** (朝议郎), **Bearer of the Imperial Credentials** (使持节), **Commander of All Military Affairs in Han State** (汉州诸军事), **Governor of Han State** (守汉州刺史), and **Leader of the Triumphant Army** (充威胜军使), **granted the crimson fish pouch** (赐绯鱼袋).

**The Dao That Can Be Spoken** (道可道), Chapter One.
Your subject **Wang Zhen** (王真) explicates:

**The Dao That Can Be Spoken (道可道)**, Chapter One (续)
Your subject **Wang Zhen** (王真) explicates:

The **Dao** (道) is born from the **Two Qis** (二气) and abides in the realm of the **Three Realms** (三才). The most **spiritually resonant** (灵) of all things is called *most resonant* (最灵), and the one who resonates beyond even that is called the **Sage** (圣人). For the Sage governs in place of Heaven and Earth, harmonizing all things.

Thus, he speaks to establish the **Dao**, and through the **Dao** to ordain names. Yet it differs from the **True Eternal Dao** (真常之元), hence it is called *The Dao That Can Be Spoken*. As it is the origin of all things, it is thus called *The Dao That Can Be Named*. Again, the **Dao of Heaven and Earth** leaves no trace to follow, hence it is said: *"The Eternal Dao without desire reveals its mystery"* (常无欲以观其妙). The Sage’s actions manifest in form, and form can be seen, hence it is said: *"The Eternal Dao with desire reveals its boundaries"* (常有欲以观其徼).

*To observe* (观) is also *to demonstrate* (示). The **Dao’s workings in Heaven and Earth** transform from *non-being* (无) to *being* (有), hence they share the same source but differ in name. The principle of transformation shifts from *being* to *non-being*, hence they are both called *the Mysterious* (玄). The **Dao of Heaven and Earth** manifests in the four seasons, nurtures all creatures, and this is one *Mysterious* (一玄). The **Dao of the Sage** governs in place of Heaven and Earth, rectifies the nature of all things, and this too is one *Mysterious* (一玄), hence it is said: *"The Mysterious, again the Mysterious"* (玄之又玄).

Therefore, the **Daoist Sovereign** (道君) and the **Enlightened King** (明王者) rule the world, secure the myriad nations, and order the armies—who does not derive from this **Gate** (户)? Hence it is called *The Gate of All Mysteries* (众妙之门).

Your subject humbly contemplates: The **Emperor of the Primordial Mysterious** (玄元皇帝) established the **Five Thousand Characters** (五千之文), to be passed down through countless ages. His **Dao** aligns with Heaven and Earth’s sheltering embrace, compares to the Sun and Moon’s radiant rule, and its benefits are boundless. All people receive his blessings, so the **Enlightened King** who attains it may govern the world, the **feudal lords** (诸侯) who attain it may secure the myriad lands, the **ministers and high officials** (卿大夫) who attain it may focus their efforts, the **common folk** (士庶人) who attain it may know their proper place. Yet those who love shortcuts (好径之徒), disregarding this **Dao**, will surely face regret for their inverted ways. How much more so those who defy the **Effortless** (易) and embrace the **Perilous** (险), hoping for mere fortune?

It is subtle beyond subtlety, profound beyond profundity—words cannot fully capture it. Thus, at the beginning, he marks the **Dao** as *not the True Eternal Dao* (非常道), pointing to its unique path yet shared return. At the end, he speaks of *The Gate of All Mysteries*, clarifying that all deliberations lead to one harmony. Placed at the chapter’s outset, its meaning is indeed profound.

**Chapter Two: The World All Knows (天下皆知)**
Your subject **Wang Zhen** (王真) explicates:

*Beauty* (美) is defined by its opposite, *evil* (恶). Today, all under Heaven know *beauty* as *beauty*—this is long since knowing its opposite, *evil*. All know *goodness* (善) as *goodness*—this is long since knowing its opposite, *not-goodness* (不善). Hence the following passage states:

*"The interplay of existence and non-existence,
hardship and ease,
growth and decay,
height and depth,
harmony of sound,
and succession of before and after."*

When things have names, and people have affections, then *right and wrong*, *self and other* arise in their midst. *Right and wrong*, *self and other* arise in their midst, then *love and hatred* stir, and they clash. When *love and hatred* clash, then *warfare* arises.

Warfare is not always waged with weapons—even the commoner’s struggle with hands and feet, beasts’ claws and teeth, birds’ beaks and talons, are forms of contention. Yet when **kings and lords** (王侯) take action, they inevitably employ arms.

No greater calamity exists than this. Thus, when the **Dao** is cultivated and weapons laid aside, when benefits are fostered and harms removed, the matter is settled, hence it is called *non-action* (无为). When the teaching is implemented, it is called *non-speech* (不言). Therefore, it is said:

*"The Sage dwells in affairs of non-action,
practices the teaching of non-speech."*

Non-action means letting **virtue/power** (德) operate unseen, applying **virtue/power** (德) subtly, so the people live their daily lives unaware of it—this is called non-action. Non-speech means rectifying oneself and leading others, yet not flaunting one’s own inadequacies. The ancients who spoke not at all shared this intent.

When the **Enlightened King** remains in non-action regarding *joy and anger*, then punishments and rewards are just, and arms do not rise. When he remains in non-action regarding *acquisition*, then taxes and levies are light, and offerings are simple. When he remains in non-action regarding *love and hatred*, then his uses and discards are fitting, and the worthy are distinguished from the unworthy. When he remains in non-action with those near him, then all around him are upright. When he remains in non-action with the land, then arms do not stir, and soldiers labor not. When he remains in non-action with the people, then all under Heaven is peaceful. His non-action brings beauty and benefit—indeed, such is its virtue.

Again, all things act yet do not boast of their labor—this means that all, from high to low, receive their natural allotment without complaint.

Again, he gives life yet does not claim its merit, he acts yet does not rely on his **virtue/power** (德). He stands apart from the **Transformations of Nature** (造化), yet does not dwell on his own achievements. He does not boast of his might, but remains humble in self-defense. Thus his undertakings are simple and enduring, never leaving his person—hence it is said:

*"Only he who does not dwell upon his deeds
is never driven from them."*

**Chapter Three: Do Not Prize the Worthy (不尚贤)**
Your subject **Wang Zhen** (王真) explicates:

The Sage’s governance does not flaunt his own **virtue/power** (善), nor does he display his strengths. He sets the example above, and the people follow below. When pride is extinguished, contention ceases—not that he does not employ the worthy, but that he does not let people contend over them.

From the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** (三皇五帝) to the **Kings and Conquerors** (王霸), none have failed to honor the **Three Matters of Reverence** (上尊三事)—the sovereign, ministers, and the **Hundred Officials** (百寮)—and to respect the **feudal lords** below. They relied on their ministers’ counsel and harmony within, and on their consorts’ support from without. How could this be called *not prizing the worthy*?

Hard-to-obtain treasures are rare goods from distant lands. If the ruler above values them without restraint, then those below will exhaust themselves in supplying them, and contention for their acquisition will arise—what is this but theft? When theft spreads, arms will surely follow.

The Sage, understanding **Dao/Way**, does not let such desires unsettle his heart. Hence his mind cannot be disordered.

Therefore, the Sage *empties his heart*—this means purifying his thoughts and halting his fixations. He *fills his belly*—this means nurturing loyalty and embracing sincerity.

「Weaken his will, and he will be modest and yielding, never provoking from without. Strengthen his bones, and he will be firm and prepared within.

The Sage always keeps people ignorant and desireless—this is because he sets himself upright to rectify others, so even the wise dare not act otherwise. Hence, the following passage speaks of the *Uncarved Block* (無為者), meaning it admonishes the ruler to refrain from military conflicts and wars.

The saying goes: *"What did Shun do? He merely revered himself and ruled from the southern throne."* If all rulers could embody Shun’s **virtue/power** (德), how could the world fail to be governed? Thus it is said: *"To practice the Uncarved Block is to achieve governance without failure."*

**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way is boundless yet its application is clear.**
*True Statement by the Minister* says: This chapter speaks of the ruler embodying the Dao/Way in his governance, having no overflowing ambition, and perpetually maintaining a deep, serene stillness—like the ancestral source of all things. Then, naturally, he will blunt the sharpness of hostile blades and dissolve the chaos of contention, harmonizing brilliance and tempering severity. He will blend with the common, abandoning filth and stagnation.

Yet *Xuan Yuan* (玄元) deeply laments that such a Dao-governed ruler can preserve his supreme **virtue/power** (至德) in this way, saying: *"I do not know whose child he is, yet he surpasses the Emperor’s ancestors."* (言似天帝之先也)

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth are not unkind.**
*True Statement by the Minister* says: This speaks of the unkind as the same as the *unvirtuous* (不德) below. The Dao/Way of Heaven and the ruler’s governance both bestow kindness universally, benefiting the world with goodness—without specifying what is benefited, nor demanding reciprocity for the act of creation. If the ruler does not demand from others, then punishments naturally will not be used. When punishments are not used, then arms will not rise. When arms do not rise, then the world will naturally be at peace. Hence it is said: *"Between Heaven and Earth, it is like the use of a keyhole."* (故曰天地之间其犹橐钥乎)

This means that the sovereign, able to regulate the primordial **qi** (元气) and govern all affairs, functions like a keyhole—endless and unstrained in its operation.

Again, the saying goes: *"A person who does not speak is already speaking."* (夫人不言，言必有中) Therefore, the Sage acts in the Uncarved Block and teaches through silence, saying: *"Many words lead to exhaustion; better to hold to the center."* (多言数穷，不如守中) This is what is meant.

**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit never dies.**
*True Statement by the Minister* says: *Valley* (谷) is both nourishment and emptiness. The **spirit-qi** (神气) dwells in the void, thus attaining eternal preservation.

*Xuan Tian* (玄天) is the nose, *Pin Di* (牝地) is the mouth. Heaven’s essence lies in clarity, Earth’s in tranquility. This means that if the ruler perpetually upholds the Dao/Way of clarity and serenity, governing his realm accordingly, he will naturally avoid restless exertion and laborious affairs. Hence it is said: *"Use it without exhaustion."* (用之不勤)

**Chapter Seven: Heaven endures, Earth persists.**
*True Statement by the Minister* says: Heaven is clear yet ceaselessly moves, Earth is tranquil yet endlessly still—both abide by nature’s transformation, never acting in isolation, nor boasting of their deeds, nor hoarding their life. They spread the sun and distribute the moon, yet do not claim ownership. Thus they endure forever.

Therefore, the Sage can emulate Heaven and Earth’s **virtue/power** (德)—clear, tranquil, boundless, and empty—never daring to act before others, and thus attains eternal primacy. (故能长先矣)

Again, *externalizing his body* (外其身) means not boasting of his own worth, so that calamities cannot reach him—that is how he preserves his life.

Again, the passage says: *"When I have no body, what harm can come to me?"* (及吾无身，吾有何患) Is this not what is meant?

If the ruler restrains himself and returns to propriety, making the world embrace kindness, then he will gain the joy of all people, and even barbarians will submit in reverence. Naturally, arms will cease, and the ancestral temples will be secure. Hence it is said: *"It is not because he has no self-interest that he achieves self-interest."* (非以其无私邪，故能成其私)

**Chapter Eight: The highest excellence is like water.**
*True Statement by the Minister* says: This chapter particularly elucidates the profound essence of governing through the Dao/Way.

The highest excellence in warfare is likened to water—yet when water overflows, it brings floods and ruin; when arms are misused, it brings slaughter and devastation. Therefore, water governs by nourishing all things and facilitating vessels; arms govern by securing the people and defending the state.

If governing through arms can emulate water’s *non-contention* (不争), and also dwell in the place of evil, harming none—then it approaches the Dao/Way.

Hence, when arms are raised or armies assembled, they must be done at the right time, for the sake of strategy and rescue. Thus it is said: *"Action is governed by timing."* (动善时也)

Since the previous passage has already outlined the seven virtues of non-contention, this passage reiterates: *"Only through non-contention is there no blame."* (夫惟不争，故无尤者) The minister humbly submits that the author’s intent is deeply instructive—he wishes to exhort the ruler to practice the Uncarved Block above and non-contention below.

The Uncarved Block is the source of quelling arms; non-contention is the root of ceasing warfare. If kings and feudal lords can clearly discern its source and thoroughly observe its root, simplifying their contentions and halting their battles, then their military affairs will be at rest.

The minister further reflects from his study of the *Five Thousand Words* (五千之文): When probing the profound truths and meticulously researching the grand principles, he has always found that the first teaching is the Uncarved Block, the second is non-contention—these are the guiding principles.

Human nature cannot avoid contention, yet only the Sage can achieve non-contention.

Contention arises from many causes: lack of foresight, absence of ritual and law, fearlessness, intolerance—thus, rebellion and defiance lead to contention; rigidity and strength lead to contention; arrogance and cruelty lead to contention; anger leads to contention; extravagance leads to contention; boasting and self-aggrandizement lead to contention; love of victory leads to contention; stubbornness and perversity lead to contention; greed and ambition lead to contention; boldness and ferocity lead to contention; partiality and favoritism lead to contention.

If a king possesses even one of these, then his armies will be raised within the realm. If a feudal lord possesses even one of these, then his wars will be waged in his own state.

「The noble ministers possess even one of these, and then bandits and chaos will arise in their households. The commoners and scholars possess even one of these, and then harm will befall their own persons.

Thus, the king who knows how to govern people and how to pacify them must first remove their afflictions, so that they may have no contention, and then war may be stilled.

When war is stilled, then armies will naturally cease their hostilities. Hence, the essential principle lies in non-contention.

Moreover, when one contends for cities, slaughter fills the streets; when one contends for lands, slaughter covers the fields. It is said that the virtuous man has no contention, and again, that one should not contend in matters of ugliness. Contention breeds war; how much more so for the king, who should not naturally engage in contention!

Therefore, the final passage of the *Lower Canon* states: **"The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming; the Dao of the Sage acts without contending."** This is what is meant by knowing the principle of **"the end is the beginning"** (*zhi zhong zhi*).

**On Holding Fullness Without Overflow (Chapter Nine):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"War is what people rely upon for protection."* Even a commoner, with a three-foot blade and a few inches of dagger, can dare to menace the Son of Heaven, threaten the feudal lords, or seek alliances in advance, or demand justice behind their backs—often achieving their ends. How much more so for one who holds the supreme position, commands countless armies, stands alone above all, and faces the myriad things below! Only then does one understand that holding fullness is difficult, and wielding sharpness is perilous. Hence it is said: *"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them; wealth and honor bring arrogance, and one invites disaster upon oneself."*

The Sage thus admonishes with the most valued things of the age—gold and jade—hoping they may preserve them, fostering a sense of caution. This is a special warning to kings and lords: to maintain humility and moderation, to abandon extravagance and excess, and to heed the words of *"I, the Steward"* (Yī, the mythical sage), lest they bring ruin upon themselves. Therefore, the text further states: *"When virtue and name are accomplished, withdraw in retreat—this is the Dao of Heaven."* By "withdraw in retreat," it does not mean that one must necessarily abandon the throne, but rather that one should not cling to one’s achievements.

Thus, the *Canon* says: *"Only by not dwelling upon them does one not lose them."* This is what is meant.

**On Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing Unity (Chapter Ten):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"The vital essence (魄) is the substance of yin; the unity (一) is the essence of yang."* This passage instructs the ruler to always cherish and guard the single breath of *qi*, focusing solely on gentle harmony, like the virtue of an infant.

To purify and remove all impurities, one must wash the heart and illuminate the mind, ensuring that the will remains unblemished.

To love people and govern the realm without interference, one must first love people without interference. To love people without interference means to first cease from interfering in matters of war. War is the deepest harm; to love people, one must first remove this harm. Hence, *"Cease from interfering in war."*

The *Heavenly Gate* (天门) refers to the breath of nostrils—one must cultivate it so that, though still, the inhalation and exhalation proceed naturally, like the flow of wind and rain.

*Brightness* (明白) refers to vision and hearing—one must let them spread in all directions, yet remain ever as if unaware.

From this point onward, all speak of cultivating the self and the realm, the Dao of universal love.

To *nourish and preserve* (生之畜之), to *create without possession*, to *act without reliance*, to *lead without dominating*—this is called *mysterious virtue* (玄德). Above this, the Sage follows Heaven’s Dao to nurture all things, thus not dwelling upon their achievements, and saying instead: *"This is Heaven’s virtue."* *Mysterious* (玄) here means *Heavenly*.

**On the Thirty Spokes Converging at the Single Hub (Chapter Eleven):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"This carriage, along with houses and rooms, all exemplify how the utility of having arises from the emptiness of non-having, and the utility of non-having arises from the fullness of having."* Thus, they are cited as evidence. Why? Because the five types of arms also rely on their *non-being* to fulfill their *being*—their use. Though bows and arrows may threaten the world with their sharpness, they need not strike to be effective. Hence, one knows that arms are prepared for their *being*, yet when not wielded, they return to *non-being*—this is using what is not used. Clearly, *non-being* is what makes their use possible.

**On the Five Colors Harming the Eyes (Chapter Twelve):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"The five colors nourish the eyes, yet excessive sight leads to blindness. The five tones nourish the ears, yet excessive hearing leads to deafness. The five flavors nourish the mouth, yet excessive eating leads to exhaustion."*

Thus, the Sage’s governance always corrects the excesses of the people, preserving their bodies and calming their spirits.

The ruler’s heart must be rooted in wisdom and founded on clarity. If they chase beasts in wild lands, race chariots until the roads run red with blood, let the six dragons (the celestial steeds) stray from their course, and command ten thousand cavalry who cannot be pursued—if they vie with falcons for precedence, or compete with bears and tigers for valor—if the sun and moon are obscured, banners entangled, and they gallop recklessly without return, slaughtering without gain, while storms rage endlessly and palaces lie empty—this is called madness. It arises from here.

Therefore, the *Canon* says: *"How can the master of myriad chariots (a king) lightly risk his life against the world? This is what is meant."*

Again, when the ruler values rare and difficult treasures, bandits and thieves emerge. When bandits and thieves emerge, war arises from this, and no harm is greater than war.

To let people act while obstructing them is naturally appropriate. Thus, the Sage governs the *abdomen* (腹), valuing its capacity to receive without attachment, and does not govern the *eyes* (目), despising their tendency to see and desire. Hence, *"Abandon that and take this."*

**On Favor and Humiliation as Surprising (Chapter Thirteen):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"The king’s retention of his position comes from Heaven’s favor; the feudal lord’s possession of his state comes from the king’s favor. Thus, nobility arises from favor, and from nobility comes pride. From pride comes guilt, and from guilt comes humiliation. Therefore, the Sage’s gains and losses are always as if surprising."*

Again, if the king and lord cannot humble themselves beneath the noble and exalt the humble, if they only love war and rely on arms, if they, in victory, despise the enemy—then disaster will surely follow them. Thus, to have one’s own body is to suffer one’s own body; to cast off one’s own body is to preserve one’s own body. Is this not profound?

**On Valuing the Self (Chapter Fourteen):**
Thus, he who esteems his own body may temporarily entrust himself to the world,
while he who loves his own body may forever repose in the world.
Hence the Classic says: *"The Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself."*
Is this not what is meant?

**On the Unseen (Chapter Fifteen):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"Yí (夷) is the name for simplicity and ease—
the Way of Heaven, hence it may be seen yet remains unseen.
Xī (希) is the name for yielding and compliance—
the Way of Earth, hence it may be heard yet remains unheard.
Wēi (微) is the name for subtlety and marvel—
the Way of Man, hence it may be grasped yet remains unattained.

Yet Heaven, though clear and luminous in its motion,
never displays its brilliance to flaunt itself.
Earth, though tranquil and vast in its depth,
never shrouds itself in darkness to obscure itself.
Man, though endlessly vital in his generation,
never distinguishes himself to exalt himself.
Thus it is said: *‘Its upper reaches are not dazzling, its lower depths are not murky.’*

*Glittering yet nameless*—
when dispersed and arrayed, it becomes the Three Powers;
when merged and unified, it becomes One Virtue.
Hence it is said: *‘Returning to the formless, this is called the form of the formless,
the image of the imageless—this is called hūhuāng (惚恍).’*

Above, it is said that all things arise from the Non-being into Being,
and from Being return to the Non-being—
hū (惚) in Being, huāng (恍) in Non-being—
hence it is said: *‘Sudden and elusive.’*

Again, to approach it, one sees no head;
to follow it, one sees no tail—
this speaks of returning from the Three to the One,
without beginning or end.
From the One, the Three emerge—
without end or beginning—
thus enabling the sovereign to grasp this ancient Way of Non-action
to govern the present world of named things.

*Non-action* also means no wars or battles,
*named things* mean the affairs of military and state.
Thus, to know the principle of *primordial simplicity* (始朴素)
is to establish the framework of the Dao.

**On the Ancient Skilled Warrior (Chapter Sixteen):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"This is the ancient skilled warrior—
the upper rank of warriors, those who, like the Sage and the Virtuous,
hold the positions of king and lord.

The subtle, mysterious, and profound—
all are the applications of virtue and power,
beyond what can be named.

The Sage and the Virtuous, governing the world and its armies,
are ever cautious and fearful, as if treading on thin ice—
their bearing and intentions always like one crossing a frozen river in winter,
fearing shame before neighbors—
this is the utmost in vigilance.

*Dignified as a guest*—
the Classic says: *‘When wielding arms, one must not dare to be the attacker but the defender,
not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.’*

*Dissolved as ice about to melt*—
speaking of contraction and expansion, bending and stretching,
never fixed or rigid.

*Unadorned and sincere*—
this is the meaning of *natural simplicity*.
*Vast and deep*—
this is the meaning of *profound depth*.

For the turbid, given time, clears naturally;
for the still, given time, thrives naturally—
all in accordance with the principles of Nature.

In motion and stillness, never losing their proper time—
who else could do this but the Sage and the Virtuous?

Thus it is said: *‘Preserve this Way without excess,’*
meaning that if kings and lords uphold this Way,
they must not overflow with arrogance.

Thus it is said: *‘Only by not being full can one endure like worn-out cloth,
never new or pristine.’*
This means that by steadfastly adhering to the Way,
without boastful display,
one attains lasting endurance—
not establishing the appearance of novelty.

**On Attaining Supreme Emptiness (Chapter Seventeen):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"The Way of Heaven is ever clear and supremely empty,
covering all without partiality.
The Way of Earth is ever settled and vast,
nurturing all without favoritism.
Thus, yin and yang each maintain their constancy,
and so all people and things fulfill their natural processes of generation.
Hence it is said: *‘All things arise together.’*

*Fù (复)* reveals the mind of Heaven and Earth,
hence it is said: *‘I observe their return.’*

Things *yún yún (芸芸)*—
this is the meaning of endless generation.
When the principle of generation is exhausted,
each returns to its root and preserves its stillness—
this is called *returning to the root as stillness*,
*stillness as returning to one’s nature*,
*returning to one’s nature as constancy*.
This means all things suffer no great harm,
each attaining its own nature and life,
fulfilling their natural allotment—
thus one may say they have attained the True Constant Way.
Therefore, the Sage who knows this True Constant Way
is clear and unobstructed, without doubt or confusion.

If the sovereign does not know this True Constant Way
but instead indulges his desires,
acts recklessly and brings misfortune,
stirs up arms and spreads poisonous influence—
then calamity will surely follow.
Hence it is said: *‘Reckless action brings ruin.’*

Again, *knowing constancy in bearing*—
if the king and lord can embrace the people and nurture the multitudes,
this is called *utter impartiality and selflessness*.
Utter impartiality and selflessness—
then the Way of Kingship naturally manifests.
The Way of Kingship manifests—
then his virtue mirrors Heaven.
His virtue mirrors Heaven—
then he may align with the Dao.
Once aligned with the Dao,
naturally he attains longevity and endurance,
free from peril or disaster,
thus completing his thousand-year reign.

**On the Supreme Sovereign’s Foresight (Chapter Eighteen):**
The Minister truly expounds: *"In the age of Great Antiquity, when the Great Dao prevailed,
the Supreme Virtue did not claim to be Virtue—
thus those below only knew that there was a sovereign above them,
unaware of its daily operation.

In the Middle Ages, benevolence and kindness were applied,
favor and grace extended—
thus they were loved and cherished,
praised and esteemed—
its governance gradually became apparent.

Next, governance was by *righteousness*,
minor offenses punished with penalties,
major offenses met with arms—
thus they were feared.

Below this, governance was by *rites*,
but elaborate rites bring disorder,
sincerity lost, deceit arises—
thus they were scorned.

Again, when words are insincere, people do not trust.
When speech is adorned with deceit, even empty words are prized.
Alas! Thus the sovereign should strive to achieve
*effortless success* and *unfailing affairs*,
so that the people do not know of imperial power—
all deeming it natural that goodness prevails."*

*End of Volume One of the Military Commentary on the Dao De Jing*
*Begin Volume Two of the Military Commentary on the Dao De Jing*

**Volume Two of the *Military Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Fades, Virtue Takes Form**

Master Wang Zhen says: When the Great Dao is obscured, virtue must act. Thus, the practice of *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) begins. Cleverness and petty wisdom arise, and great deceit follows. Filial piety and kindness spring from discord, loyal ministers emerge from chaos—this is how beauty and vice define each other.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Wise, Abandoning Knowledge**

Master Wang Zhen says: This speaks of rejecting the *traced* sage and abandoning cunning intelligence, for then people reap great benefit—hence, *a hundredfold gain*. Benevolence arises from non-benevolence, righteousness from non-righteousness. Now, if we seek to discard false benevolence and abandon deceitful righteousness, then kin will naturally harmonize, and filial piety will return.

Again, by abandoning licentious cleverness and private gain, warfare will not rise. If warfare does not rise, thieves and rebels will not act.

Yet still, fearing later generations may not grasp the true meaning behind these words, it is said: These three things are insufficient as mere precepts, so they must be paired with *seeing simplicity* and *embracing purity*, with *few thoughts* and *few desires*.

*Seeing simplicity*—this means concealing one’s crude and uncultured appearance.
*Embracing purity*—this means harboring one’s true and genuine intent.

As for *thoughts* and *desires*—though they are the essence of human nature, they must be moderated, not eradicated. Thus, the sage advises rulers to reduce and diminish them, so that the state may prolong its destiny and people may receive its blessings.

**Chapter Twenty: Cease Learning, End Worry**

Master Wang Zhen says: By abandoning the learning of gain, worry ceases. *Yes* and *no*, *good* and *evil*—these are vastly close. Again, it warns: Why do you not revere but instead indulge in arrogance? Why abandon goodness for wickedness? Is this not deeply confusing?

Thus it is said: What people fear, you must fear.

Now, the masses bustle and indulge in desires, ever hungry as if feasting on the finest sacrificial meat, ever climbing as if ascending the Spring Pavilion, abandoning themselves to boundless passion.

Therefore, the Daoist ruler says: *I alone remain still and silent*, like an infant unaware of the world. Like one riding in a carriage without destination, drifting without end—this is to show humility, retreat, and modesty, not to emulate the boastful and self-aggrandizing.

Thus it is further said: *Yet I alone seem abandoned*—my heart is that of a simpleton.

It is not that my heart is truly that of a simpleton. I am merely dim and forgetful, lost in stillness, alone in my stubbornness, unlike others.

And yet, *honoring the Mother*—*food* is *submission*, *Mother* is *Dao*. This is to urge the ruler to submit to the Dao in body, to dwell in non-action, so that warfare naturally ceases and the world attains peace.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Form of Great Virtue**

Master Wang Zhen says: *Kong* means *great*—this speaks of the form of great virtue, referring to Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth follow the Dao in their birth and transform through it, hence: *Only the Dao is followed*.

The Dao, as a thing, is *dim* and *faint*—faint and dim, yet within it lies form, speaking of the primordial *qi*, shifting from non-being to being. Faint and dim, yet within it lies substance, speaking of the *beginning of formation*, where form takes shape. Profound and dark, yet within it lies essence, speaking of the union of male and female, where all things transform and are born—though hidden in darkness, they never lose their truth. Thus: *From ancient times to today, its name does not fade*.

Again, it speaks of all things first emerging from this faint, dark, and profound state, hence: *How do I know the multitude is thus?*—by this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Bending Preserves Wholeness**

Master Wang Zhen says: Here, *curve* refers to *yielding and compliance*, not to deceitful or crooked ways. From this point onward, all words are spoken in reverse meaning. Thus, the sage who embraces *oneness* takes this *curve-preserving* Dao as the model for the world.

Again, from *not self-asserting* to the next four passages, all speak of the *non-contending* Way.

Thus: *Only by not contending does one ensure no one can contend with you*. If no one can contend, then warfare naturally ceases. Hence, the ancient saying *bending preserves wholeness*—is this not true?

Truly, this *curve-preserving* Dao returns to the root of *correct stillness*. This is the foremost way to govern armies and states.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Sparse Speech, Natural Order**

Master Wang Zhen says: *Sparse speech* means *non-action and non-interference*. If rulers merely reduce their words and simplify their affairs, they align with the natural Way.

Again, governing the state or waging war both shun hasty, violent policies. Thus, the analogy of *sudden wind and torrential rain* is given to illustrate this.

Those who share the same Dao and virtue are in harmony. Those who share in loss are also in gain—for their confusion has long endured, and those who share in loss each find their own gain, yet none know they were lost. Thus: *Loss is also gain*.

As for *untrustworthy faith*—this refers to the lower ranks lacking trust, arising from the ruler’s own lack of trust.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Cannot Stand**

Master Wang Zhen says: Those who walk with a limp, stride wide, or stagger cannot stand upright or move steadily. This critiques the restless and competitive, those who raise armies and stir the masses, all failing to uphold the central Way.

How much more so for those who boast of their wisdom, flaunt their righteousness, praise their own deeds, and vaunt their superiority! Thus, the sage condemns these foul foods and ugly deeds—how can the virtuous dwell among them?

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Formless Form**

Master Wang Zhen says: This chapter speaks of the Dao’s essence—its form without form, its image without image, its name without name, its thing without thing. Hence, it is called *Great* by force of naming. To speak of *Great* is to speak of boundless, limitless expanse. Though all directions are vast, the Dao reaches everywhere. *Reaching* is like passing—passing without ceasing must go far, and when far, it must return to its extreme. Thus, it is called *Return*. This speaks of the Dao’s cyclical course, ever-present in all things, hence it is the Mother of the world. *Mother* is the Dao’s origin; *origin* is One. Thus the Classic says: *"Princes and lords who grasp the One may rule the world with integrity."* This is what is meant by *"correcting the many with the One to rule."*

Hence, the Three Powers follow the Dao, and the Dao follows its natural course. Thus, the Sage follows nature, and all affairs are accomplished.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Light as Root of the Heavy**

Master Wang Zhen says: The noble does not make himself heavy, lest he lose his awe. Again, stillness is the nature of virtue. When ancient texts speak of the noble, they refer to both the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords. Even if one travels all day, as a noble must prepare his ceremonial carriage, reside in his retinue’s midst, and guard against unforeseen dangers—his chariot and escort are the implements of war and defense. Though the ruler may have detached palaces far removed, how can he, bearing the weight of the realm, lighten himself before the world? This is a stern warning against solitary journeys or covert movements in a single carriage.

Thus, reckless action violates the rites of ruling and serving, while haste undermines the duty of subjects to their lord. How can one not fear this? Hence: *"Lightness loses subjects; haste loses the lord."* Is this not so?

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way Leaves No Tracks**

Master Wang Zhen says: *No tracks* means no action. *No blemish* means holding to the center. *No use of plans* means victory in battle is certain. *Cannot be opened* means defense is unbreakable. *Cannot be undone* means there is no beginning or end. These five virtues are the Sage’s secret strategies—concealing talent, not boasting of self, not revealing boundaries, not displaying form. He always seeks to still arms before conflict arises, to end war before contention begins. Thus, the state has no abandoned people, and people have no discarded things. All this follows the subtle Dao of the enlightened Sage.

Moreover, the Sage does not impose virtue upon people or flaunt benevolence before things. He merely lets the people live daily without knowing it, hence he does not emphasize the master-disciple relationship. Yet fearing the masses may not awaken to ultimate truth, he delves deeply into profound teachings—truly the essence of subtlety.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing Its Heroism**

Master Wang Zhen says: The ruler, possessing heroic talent, bold vision, majestic bearing, and fierce *qi*, sits upon the highest throne, above the masses, surrounded by armies and officials. Though he need not be cruel to be stern, nor angry to be awe-inspiring, he must always maintain a yielding stillness, like a valley of the world. A *valley* is a place of emptiness that receives floods and hides filth. Thus, his virtue never departs from him.

Returning to the state of an infant—this means guarding the Dao and embracing virtue, preserving his true nature undiminished, so that deceit cannot enter his mind. Though his wisdom is clear and bright, he must always uphold the silent, dark Way of bowing in stillness, setting the standard for the world. Thus, his virtue remains without flaw, returning to the utmost center.

Honor and disgrace follow one another. If the ruler knows that splendor comes and goes swiftly, and always considers that adversity follows, he becomes the *valley* of the world. *Valley* shares the same meaning as *stream*—thus his virtue remains full, returning to *primordial simplicity*. *Primordial simplicity* is the essence of original *qi*. Hence, the Sage disperses simplicity to form vessels, and uses people to establish officials. *Great governance* refers to ruling the world and state. To govern the world is not to engage in petty divisions—thus, *great governance does not cut*.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Those Who Would Seize the World**

Master Wang Zhen says: This chapter speaks of those who, without expectation, seek to seize the world. I have already seen that they cannot succeed. *Seizing* refers to stirring up arms and conflict. Hence, the world’s sacred treasure cannot be taken by force. *Cannot be taken* means it cannot be seized with weapons. If one attempts this, they must fail—even if they temporarily gain it, they will lose it just as swiftly. Thus, things have movement and follow, warmth and cold, strength and weakness, bearing and collapse—all are the alternating patterns of calamity and fortune.

Hence, the Sage avoids extremes, excess, and extravagance, seeking to stand in the Middle Way and guard it without slackening—this is the utmost warning.

---

**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**

Master Wang Zhen says: This chapter admonishes ministers and advisors who aid the ruler. It says to assist the sovereign with the Dao, not with force against the world. The consequences are good when returned. I dare cite the Qin as an example. Li Si, Zhao Gao, Bai Qi, and Meng Tian—none assisted their lord with the Dao. Instead, they swallowed the world with brute force, burned books, buried scholars alive, and slaughtered forty thousand Zhao soldiers. Wherever they subdued, they exterminated all traces, leaving no survivors. Even Qin Shi Huang, with his greedy gaze upon the world, was never satisfied. Though his reign ended, the lingering poison led to mutual destruction, and the state collapsed like crumbling earth. Thus, Hu Hai was assassinated at Mangyi, Zi Ying executed in Xianyang, Fu Su died at the Great Wall, Li Si and his son perished at Yunyang, Bai Qi killed himself at Duwei, Zhao Gao met his end in the palace—all were the returns of their deeds.

The general who acts must do so with decisive resolve, yet without arrogance, without pride, and without compulsion. To act only when unavoidable—this is the essential Dao of the sage’s use of force.

When victory is achieved, one must not boast of it, nor rejoice in killing. Serenity is supreme; even in triumph, there is no beauty in it. This is the meaning of decisive action without compulsion.

When things reach their peak, they grow old—this is the fate of all armies. What is meant by *"early cessation"* is that an unjust war must be halted early, before further advance.

Had Li Si and Bai Qi’s armies withdrawn in time, how could they have met their self-immolation?

---

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Fine Weapon**
True says: *"Weapons"* refer to swords, spears, halberds, and lances. *"Fine"* means *"good."* Yet the finest, most adorned, and prized weapons are the most pernicious of tools.

The left, yang, is auspicious; the right, yin, is inauspicious. The sage must use force only when unavoidable, and then with utmost tranquility. Tranquility means stillness; *"dull"* means without relish. Though victory may be won, it should be without savor—hence, *"not beautiful."* To find beauty in it is to delight in slaughter.

Yet those slain are our own kindred—how can one rejoice in their death? If one does, how can the sovereign hope to govern the world?

In ancient times, when many were slain, they were mourned with tears. Victory was treated with funeral rites, for the dead were our own people—how could they not be honored thus?

Later generations did otherwise. Where armies marched, success and failure were often balanced. Even if one side won, they would first proclaim their deeds in grand banners, exaggerating numbers—ten as a hundred, a hundred as a thousand, a thousand as ten thousand—to magnify their achievements. Though rulers might suspect deception, they still relied on such displays to bolster their prestige and establish their might. This only breeds resentment in the open and divine wrath in secret. Hence, it is said: *"Thus, one cannot hope to govern the world."*

How then can such a general claim to assist the sovereign with the Dao?

---

**Chapter Thirty-Twenty-Two: The Dao Without Name**
True says: *"Uncarved wood"* is the substance of the Dao. Its subtlety and refinement permeate all things, hence it is called *"small."* If rulers and nobles could uphold this subtle Dao, maintaining non-action and stillness, all things would come and submit of their own accord.

Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, would naturally harmonize. Sweet dew and timely rains would descend without fail. Thus, the people would naturally attain balance and equity.

For this reason, names were later assigned to things. Once named, distinctions arose—between sovereign and subject, superior and inferior, all things and all affairs—each knowing its proper place. Thus, the sovereign knows to stop at benevolence, the minister at loyalty, the child at filial piety, the friend at trust, the husband and wife at righteousness, the warrior at restraint, the tax collector at moderation. When each knows its proper limit, none shall fall into peril.

Just as the Dao flows through the world, governing like rivers and seas—gathering, responding, and converging without rest—so too does its influence.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others**
True says: Measuring depth, listening to speech, observing conduct—how can one fail to discern a person? Thus, one may be called *"wise in knowing others."* But to purify the heart, illuminate the inner self, and attain clarity beyond ego and others—this is the mark of the near-sage. It is said that self-knowledge is the hallmark of the near-sage, for human self-awareness is so difficult.

Though Qin did not achieve hegemony, it presumptuously styled itself *"Emperor."* Though Xiang Yu never attained true strength, he prematurely claimed the title *"Hegemon."* Yet Qin swallowed the world whole, while Chu subdued the feudal lords. When they swallowed, the Six Kingdoms retreated; when they roared, their armies scattered. Such was their brute force and victory over others.

But those who rely on brute force to triumph are never truly victorious in the end.

Consider the Zhou—its virtue was profound and benevolent. Was it not the very essence of self-mastery? It shunned the barbarians yet loved its people; those who followed did so as though drawn by market crowds. When it displayed its forces and took oaths, the people rallied as if by appointment. Yet when its later descendants grew tyrannical, the feudal lords resisted, and though they ruled for decades, the throne remained vacant for forty or fifty years. Was this not the triumph of self-mastery?

Thus, those who achieve hegemony or kingship must first be victors over themselves. To be a victor, one must be strong. To be strong, one must harness the strength of others. To harness others, one must win their hearts. To win hearts, one must first master oneself. To master oneself, one must be yielding and soft.

Therefore, the strong and mighty, guided by the Dao, conquer without battle. The small and weak, guided by the Dao, gain without strife.

Wealth through contentment is human virtue. Unrelenting self-strengthening is the Way of Heaven. To steadfastly guard the Dao without deviation—what else is this but enduring success? To persevere to the end as at the beginning—what else is this but avoiding defeat? What else is this but longevity?

The **Dao** is vast and overflowing—Chapter Thirty-Four
True Statement by the Minister says: This speaks of the **Dao**’s boundless abundance, filling the world with left and right alike, meaning all things arise from it and are encompassed by it. All things rely upon it to flourish and thrive, and also to express their gratitude for its blessings.

When achievements are complete yet no possession is claimed, it means the Sage follows the **Dao** in governance, bestowing love without intention and nurturing without attachment. Thus, they do not assert dominion over all things, and naturally, their desires remain ever unfulfilled. How could this be called a minor perversion?

Moreover, when all things return to the **Dao**, the Sage governs them with utmost impartiality, yet does not say, *"I am the master of all things."* How could this not be deemed the greatest perversion? Therefore, the Sage never claims preeminence, and thus their greatness shines ever more brightly.

The **Chapter of Grasping the Grand Symbol**—Chapter Thirty-Five
True Statement by the Minister says: Heaven displays its **symbols** (大象), and the Sage follows them. When a king upholds the grand **symbols** without straying from the **Dao**, all under Heaven will flock to him. Those who come will be settled and nourished with virtue and power, allowing them to move freely without hindrance. What then is the difference between this and placing food and feasts upon broad thoroughfares, inviting all passersby to partake and be satisfied?

Again, with subtle and refined methods, the Sage governs armies and leads troops, always valuing tranquility and blandness as supreme. Naturally, they become formless and without limit, so that those who see or hear them cannot discern their presence.

Again, the **Dao**’s practice grows ever greater and more abundant, without end or measure. Hence it is said: *"Its use cannot be exhausted."*

**Exhausted** (既) means **complete**, **fulfilled**.

**When One Would Seek to Restrict**—Chapter Thirty-Six
True Statement by the Minister says: This chapter directly speaks of the principle that Heaven and Earth, spirits and gods, harm when full and bestow when modest. It states that those who govern the realm and lead armies must always reflect upon the **Dao** of Heaven and observe human affairs, deeply warning themselves: *"Heaven’s timing and human affairs now open and expand for me—should I then seek to restrict and gather them in?"*

*"They now strengthen and magnify me—should I then seek to weaken and diminish myself?"*

*"They now rise and flourish me—should I then seek to ruin and overthrow them?"*

*"Now they indeed bestow abundance upon me—should I then seek to plunder and seize it for myself?*

If kings and lords can maintain this vigilance from beginning to end, they may be said to perceive both the subtle and the manifest.

Thus, the following passage states: *‘The soft overcomes the hard.’* This does not mean that those of weak nature must necessarily subdue the strong, but rather that rulers, already in a position of strength, should cultivate the mind of yielding to conquer.

Therefore, humility, modesty, frugality, and restraint bring enduring prosperity.
Arrogance, insolence, extravagance, and licentiousness invite self-inflicted ruin—this is the constant principle of things.

Even the Sage fears they may not awaken, so the passage further warns:
*'Fish must not be drawn from the depths.'*
Fish symbolize the common people, the depths symbolize virtue and Dao.
The ruler governs the people and must place them in a realm of benevolence and longevity, ensuring they dwell in deep waters, ever free from the perils of nets and drying up, thus securing their peace and happiness.

Moreover, ancient kings displayed their virtue without parading their arms—arms are the sharpest instruments of the state, and must not be openly displayed to others. Arms exist for war yet remain unused, preserved yet not discarded; they should be kept in reserve within, never exposed or discarded without. If displayed externally, defeat and humiliation will surely follow—how can one be too cautious?

---
**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao of Constant Non-Action**
The Minister’s True Statement says: *‘The Constant Dao’* refers to the origin of the Nameless; *‘the Dao that is Constant’* refers to the beginning of the Named. Thus, the original *wu* (無) without letters is the root of the One Qi, yet once named, it becomes the beginning of all things.

Again, the Dao follows nature spontaneously—Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, all harmonize naturally without contrivance, hence *‘non-action.’* Yet when the four seasons move and all things mature, it is said *‘there is nothing it does not do.’*

Heaven’s Dao benefits without harming, so rulers must follow Heaven’s Dao: knowing all harm in the world requires non-action, knowing all benefit requires action. The greatest harm in the world is wielding arms; the greatest benefit is laying them down. If kings and lords but adhere to this natural Dao, all things will transform spontaneously.

Once transformation is complete, if desires arise to act, they must be restrained by the simplicity of the Nameless.
The Nameless simplicity is rooted in *‘not desiring’*—remaining still and returning to the root, enduring and restoring the original Dao. This is called returning to the Constant True Dao.

Once the Constant True Dao is restored, how could all things fail to align in order?
Thus it is said: *‘The world will rectify itself.’*
The Classic states: *‘When I am still, the people rectify themselves.’*
And the *Analects* say: *‘The Master leads with rectitude—who dares not rectify themselves?’*
Is this not what is meant?

---
**End of Volume Two: Essential Military Teachings of the *Dao De Jing***
**Beginning of Volume Three: Essential Military Teachings of the *Dao De Jing***

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Virtue of Supreme Virtue (上德不德)**

The Master said: Supreme virtue aligns with the Dao itself. This is the age of the Three Sovereigns, beyond praise—hence, it is called *not virtue*. Inferior virtue serves as the Dao’s manifestation. In the age of the Five Emperors, affection and love first emerged—hence, it is called *virtue*.

Ren, yi, and li (benevolence, righteousness, and propriety) were all practiced together in the early days of the Three Kings, when measures arose to prevent calamity and restore order. Yet if we consider their ultimate purpose—governing the world, the state, and oneself—their essence remains one. Thus, the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings, though their deeds differed, shared the same intent and ultimate goal.

Therefore, the ruler must harmonize *Dao* and *de*, ren, yi, and li—just as the five elements depend on one another, lacking none. The Sage-King draws on antiquity to illuminate gain and loss: when the *Dao* declines and martial might arises in the Three Dynasties, loyalty and sincerity grow thin, jade and silk circulate in vain, and the people’s virtue weakens while the past’s glory fades.

When *li* is lost, chaos follows, and the remedy must be *li* itself. Chaos is but the inversion of order—*li* is the principle that restores it.

Yet the Sage-King’s intent is clear: in his time, rulers abandoned *li* for *yi*, *yi* for *ren*, *ren* for *de*, and *de* for the *Dao*. Thus, the noble man seeks substance over superficiality, reality over ornament. By discarding the thin veneer of *li* and *yi* and embracing the depth of *Dao* and *de*, he governs with true transformation. Is this not the highest path? Hence, it is said: *‘Abandon the thin, take the substantial.’*

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Chapter on Obtaining the One (昔之得一)**

The Master said: The Sage-King broadly cites heaven, earth, the divine valleys, and all things that attain the One, all pointing to a warning for rulers.

*Yong* (用, "to employ") is key: Heaven does not rely on its serene clarity for self-preservation but must ever fear the threat of fracture. The divine valleys do not rest on their spiritual abundance but must dread exhaustion. All things do not depend on their vitality for endurance but must fear annihilation. Rulers must not rely on their nobility for strength but must fear the calamity of downfall.

Thus, it is said: *‘The humble is the foundation.’* Is this not true?

If a ruler does not seek self-aggrandizement, there will be no contention. Without contention, warfare will cease. When warfare ceases, the blessings of heaven endure forever.

---

**Chapter Forty: The Movement of Return (反者道之动)**

The Master said: All things arise in teeming multiplicity yet return to their root. Hence, *‘Return is the movement of the Dao.’*

Ordinary movement arises from movement itself, but the Dao’s movement arises from stillness. Thus, *‘Return is the movement of the Dao.’*

*Fan* (反) is akin to *fu* (复, "return"). It reveals the heart of heaven and earth.

Heaven and earth take stillness as their essence and movement as their function. To reverse movement is to restore stillness—hence, *‘Return is the movement of the Dao.’*

Therefore, the Sage acts with caution, dwelling in non-action, deeply understanding the principle of returning to the root and preserving stillness. Only then does one know the Constant.

Knowing the Constant, one avoids reckless action. Avoiding reckless action brings clarity to governance.

Moreover, softness and weakness are the Dao’s instruments—how the Sage subdues the world’s violent with gentle means.

Things are like affairs: all undertakings in the world arise from *you* (有, existence), which arises from *wu* (无, non-being). Thus, the Sage dwells in non-action, returning to stillness, allowing all things to flourish naturally without artificial intervention. Hence, *‘Existence arises from non-being.’*

---

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao (上士闻道)**

The Master said: Saints and sages are many, and common scholars cannot fathom their equality. Thus, the Sage-King briefly outlines three levels—superior, middle, and inferior—to distinguish those who grasp the Dao’s depths.

King Wen proclaimed: *"To hear the Dao in the morning and die in the evening would be enough."* Thus, the superior man’s eager pursuit is evident.

Given his nature—capable of both elevation and humility—he is said to be *"as if present, as if absent."* The summer insect’s doubt of ice reflects the mockery of those who hear the Dao and laugh.

Yet further, it is said: *"The bright Dao appears dim."* This speaks of heaven’s virtue—though radiant above, it remains ever obscure. *"Advancing the Dao seems like retreat."* This speaks of earth’s virtue—though flourishing below, it remains ever humble. *"Leveling the Dao seems uneven."* This speaks of the ruler’s virtue—though towering like heaven, he aligns with the common, never distinguishing himself.

Thus, even the most virtuous ruler must be as lowly as a valley, receiving all impurities. Though pure as jade, he must endure filth. Though vast and complete, he must seem insufficient. Though desiring to establish virtue in others, he must ever fear being known. Hence, *"as if petty."*

Though embodying the true Dao, he must appear ever-changing. The greatest square has no corners—how could it display sharp angles? The greatest vessel matures slowly—it does not seek swift completion. The greatest sound is inaudible—it must first gather in silence. The greatest form is shapeless—it is the form of formlessness. The Dao, originally nameless, is given names by force: *"Mother of ten thousand things,"* all borrowed from nature’s spontaneous generation. Hence, *"The good borrower succeeds."*

When the ruler holds to virtue, practicing humility and obscurity in non-action, who in the world could contend with him? Without contention, arms naturally fade away.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Rise to the One (道生一)**

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Rise to the One (道生一)**
---
The Master Zhuangzi said: When the Original *Qi* (元氣) first arises, it generates endlessly without cessation, and thus all things flourish within heaven and earth. Moreover, when things emerge, none can fail to bear the *Yin* (陰) and *Sui* (肃) *Qi*, while embracing the *Yang* (陽) and *He* (和) *Qi* within. The one that is balanced and harmonious alone attains humanity—thus it is called the most *Ling* (靈). Since it is both *Ling* and wise, it understands the principle of loss and gain, and so it names what it loathes. It seeks to avoid harm to itself while hoping for benefit, hence the saying: *"Things may suffer loss yet gain, or gain yet suffer loss—this is what is meant."* So too must the teachings and admonitions of humanity follow this principle: if one does not know the Dao of loss and gain, but relies only on the masses’ fondness for war, and recklessly displays strength while scornfully underestimating the enemy, then one must surely face humiliation and defeat, topple armies and slaughter cities—this is to invite one’s own destruction. This is what is meant by *"The recklessly strong do not meet their end."*

This is the greatest calamity in governing the world and the state. Hence it is said: *"I shall use it as my Teaching Father,"*—meaning that among all teachings, none is more weighty than this. Hence the chapter: *"The World’s Ultimate Softness"* (天下之至柔).

The Master Zhuangzi said: The ultimate softness is humble, modest, and tranquil—this is the *Qi* of nature. The ultimate firmness is rigid and forceful—this is the way of those who act. When softness is tranquil and firmness is in motion, the weak naturally overcome the strong, hence the saying: *"Gallop across the world’s ultimate firmness."* If the ruler can employ the subtle and profound Dao, achieving the principle of non-action, then he will find no barrier—hence the saying: *"There is nothing he cannot enter."* The affairs of non-action are also called tranquil and still, achieving the principle of non-action in war. Silent teaching, when he corrects himself and leads the people by example, will be followed without need for words—hence the saying: *"They do not follow his commands, but follow his actions."* And again the scripture says: *"To act in silent teaching is the way."* Yet even the Sage’s governance cannot surpass this, and the ruler laments that few in his age can follow it—hence the saying: *"The world few can attain."*

**Chapter Forty-Three: Name and Person, Which is More Intimate? (名與身孰親)**
---
The Master Zhuangzi said: *Name* (名) is rank and wealth; those who seek it forget their person. *Treasure* (貨) is riches and jewels; the greedy disregard their lives. Though even the most foolish know that *Name* is distant from the person, and the person is more precious than treasure, yet when faced with gain or loss, or the moment of taking or being taken, even the moderately wise cannot escape confusion. Only the Sage knows that war can be laid to rest, and so does not contend for *Name*. He knows that wealth can be sufficient, and so does not risk his person, nor hoard excessively, nor waste beyond measure. Thus, throughout his life, humiliation cannot reach him—hence he can endure forever.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Great Achievement Appears as Defect (大成若缺)**
---
The Master Zhuangzi said: Though the Sage dwells in a place of utter completeness, he does not boast of his achievement, but ever seems deficient—hence his actions never meet ruin. Though he holds the fullest of power, he does not grow proud of his abundance, but remains ever humble—hence his use is ever without exhaustion. He is straight with others, yet bent with himself—hence the saying: *"As if bent."* He conceals his subtleties, using only his plainness—hence the saying: *"As if crude."* He encounters words, yet cuts off flattery—hence the saying: *"As if speechless."* And indeed, the preceding chapters have detailed their grand conclusion, all rooted in the virtue of tranquility and stillness. Thus the contrasts of haste and calm, and cold and heat, are invoked to confirm it. The virtue of tranquility is non-action; non-action in war alone can make one the leader of the world. Again the scripture says: *"I love stillness, and the people will naturally correct themselves,"*—and *"If I do not desire stillness, the world will naturally correct itself"*—both are of this kind.

**Chapter Forty-Five: When the Way Prevails in the World (天下有道)**
---
The Master Zhuangzi said: To abandon the swift warhorses, and let the fields grow over with thorns and brambles—this is not the Way. Yet when the four borders bristle with fortifications, and warhorses are bred within—this is not without the Way. Hence, if the ruler indulges his desires, the people of the world will all be guilty. If his cravings reach their height and he does not know the limit of contentment, then the people of the world will all suffer calamity. Again, if the ruler takes all he desires, then the world will all be doomed to misfortune. Only if the ruler above knows contentment as contentment, will the people of the world who not always be content?

**Chapter Forty-Six: Learning Increases Daily (為學日益)**
---
The Master Zhuangzi said: The scholar says, *"I study and transmit the rites and laws of the ancient kings, and thus my governance grows ever more refined—hence the saying: ‘daily increase.’"* The follower of the Dao says, *"I close the seven gates of desire, and uphold the three treasures—hence the saying: ‘daily decrease.’"* The Dao of heaven decreases the surplus while supplementing the deficient—hence the saying: *"decrease."* The Dao of the Sage decreases the surplus to serve the world—hence the saying: *"again, decrease."* If one can employ this Dao, then naturally he will reach non-action.

The Sage, with few thoughts and few desires, lays down arms and cultivates culture, naturally doing nothing—hence the saying: *"There is nothing he does not do."* Again, the Sage as ruler is ever in non-action and non-affairs, taking the hearts of the people as his own heart—thus he can win the hearts of the world. But when he has affairs, he takes wealth and treasure from the people’s goods; and when he acts, he harms their lives with arms and war.

Thus, if one acts in this way, then kin will abandon and the people will rebel, the state will perish and the people will be in peril—how then can one win the hearts of the world? Hence it is said: *"It is insufficient to win the hearts of the world."*

**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Constant Heart**
True Disciple says: The Sage who takes the hearts of the people as his own heart is indeed the one who follows the principle of *"aligning desires with the people’s welfare."* When people are unvirtuous, the Sage also cultivates virtue in them, teaching them with *Dao* and *virtue* so that they may become virtuous—thus the Classic says: *"How can one abandon those who are unvirtuous?"* Again, when people are untrustworthy, the Sage also fosters trust in them, saying, *"My trust is insufficient to make people untrustworthy,"* and teaches them with *Dao* and *virtue* so that they may become trustworthy—thus it is said: *"virtue and trust."* Again, in observing the world, the Sage sees all people in a state of constant agitation, neither stopping nor resting, yet he harmonizes his heart with theirs, guiding them to abandon vice and embrace virtue. Thus, the people all incline their ears and eyes to perceive the Sage’s benevolent intentions, and the Sage universally cherishes them—hence it is said: *"all as infants."* Having nurtured and soothed the people of the world, the Sage is clearly their parent. How could a parent willingly harm their child with arms and punishments? It must not be so.

**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**
True Disciple says: Movement outward is birth; stillness inward is death. The thirteen [orifices]—these are the four passes and the nine apertures. The four passes are the source and flow of life and death; the nine apertures are the gates of cravings. The source and flow must observe the rhythms of motion and stillness; the gates must open and close at their proper times. To follow them is the way to longevity; to defy them is the way to death. Again, nothing preserves life better than nurturing, yet excessive nurturing harms life—hence it is said: *"Why then does one’s nurturing nurture so excessively?"* Those who excel in preserving life are the Sage and the worthy. Since the Daoist Lord is modest and does not speak of himself, it is said: *"It is heard."* The Sage’s Way benefits without harming; how could things injure him? Even in the wilds of the original lands, he does not hunt to encounter rhinoceros and tigers to kill them; even in the midst of armies, he does not don armor and weapons to slay his enemies. Thus, he never suffers from horns, claws, blades, or edges—because he can harmonize his brilliance with the dust, regulate and nourish his primordial *qi*, uphold the continuous Dao, and grasp the principle of life—hence it is said: *"Why then does one’s nurturing nurture so excessively?"* Again, in the latter ages, those who use arms to seek immortality—how could they attain it? The Dao gives birth to life.

**Chapter 51: The Dao Generates**
True Disciple says: The creative *Dao* is without sentiment yet gives birth; the nurturing *virtue* is without sentiment yet sustains. Thus, things obtain their forms and forces achieve their transformations, and all things do not fail to revere the Dao and honor *virtue*. The Dao is revered and *virtue* is honored—all naturally receive Heaven’s rank and stipend. Who could claim territorial dominion? Thus, kings and lords emulate this pattern, saying that the king should appropriately give birth, sustain, nurture, mature, and cover all things without failing their proper times, yet without claiming credit or relying on force, ceasing their domination and halting their conflicts. Only thus can one be said to conform to Heaven’s *virtue*—hence it is said: *"mysterious virtue."*

**Chapter 52: The Beginning of the World**
True Disciple says: The Dao, once named, becomes the mother of the world. The king resides within his domain, thus symbolizing his child. Having known his child, he must also guard his mother—meaning the king must uphold the Dao and nurture things. By closing his ears and dimming his sight, he will forever avoid toil, danger, and peril. Again, if he can perceive the subtle sprouts of things and prevent them, then he may be called *"clear."* Again, if he upholds the Dao of gentleness and weakness, he will surely attain strength and greatness. *"Use its light"* means to radiate *virtue* outwardly; *"return its clarity"* means to embody the Dao inwardly. Governing the state and the army without harming things—what calamity could there be? Hence it is said: *"follow the constant."* *"Follow"* is like *"secretly employing"*—meaning the king should always secretly employ this Dao. Thus, *"Make me stand alone."*

**Chapter 53: Make Me Stand Alone**
True Disciple says: *"I"* refers to the lord or king. The king who stands alone and knows how to walk the Great Dao must be most cautious in all his actions. The Great Dao is broad and easy, yet people do not follow it; instead, they prefer to take shortcuts, seeking swift gains and hasty benefits. Speed only leads to failure—thus, he deeply warns against this. Again, though the halls of court and government offices are swept clean and immaculate, the fields are yet barren, the granaries are yet empty, and the military officers and generals, whether deserving or not, all wear fine robes and carry swords, gluttonously indulge in food and drink, hoard wealth and bribes, and prey upon the needy while serving the wealthy. This is truly what is called the arrogance of thieves and bandits—how can it be called the Great Dao? This chapter is indeed the Daoist Lord’s deep sigh over the decline of the age, where the world has fallen so far astray. Hence, this chapter is established to admonish it sternly.

**Chapter 54: The Well-Built Cannot Be Uprooted**
True Disciple says: The *"well-built"* refers to the founding sovereign, who rises to prominence through *virtue*—thus, once established, he cannot be uprooted. The *"well-embracing"* refers to the succeeding ruler, who holds his position through benevolence—once upheld, he cannot be displaced. This chapter clearly illustrates that complete reliance on cultivating *virtue* and practicing benevolence is how one secures the blessings of ten thousand ages, not through the use of arms, force, or temporal fortune. Hence the Classic says: *"To win the world, one must act without affairs; when one has affairs, it is insufficient to win the world."* Again, *"Heaven’s Dao has no favorites; it always sides with the virtuous."* From ancient times, from the Heavenly Sovereign down to the Five Emperors, their descendants inherited their thrones for tens of thousands of years, or at least thousands of years. Even in the Three Dynasties, though some tyrants harmed them, they still endured for eight or nine centuries before collapsing and losing their states.

「Speaking thus, how could there be those who rely on the passage of time and fortune, or on arms and force, to take the world? It must not be so.

The *Poetry of King Wen* further states: *"Punish the few and extend to brothers; govern the family and the realm."* And again: *"The descendants of King Wen, their branches extending for a hundred generations."* Thus the Classic says: *"How do I know the world must be so? By this, is it not indeed so?"*

**Chapter on the Profound Thickness of Virtue (Chapter 55)**
True Statement from the Minister says: The ruler with thick virtue must cultivate complete and harmonious *qi*, resembling the state of an infant—innocent, without schemes or worries—naturally clear and bright, so that none may harm him.

Venomous insects, fierce beasts, and birds of prey symbolize cruel and wicked thieves and harmers. Though such wicked ones may possess sharp or poisonous *qi*, they ultimately cannot harm the ruler with thick virtue.

Again, those who draw upon *number* (五常, *wǔcháng*) but lack the harmony of the *Way* (至者, *zhì*)—when the Five Constants are fully present, it is called harmony, hence *"Knowing harmony is knowing the Constants; knowing the Constants is knowing the Way."*

Only through nurturing and benefiting life does one bring forth auspicious signs (*祥*). The ruler should daily cultivate self-restraint, guard his body and mind, ensuring gentleness, weakness, compassion, and mercy. If he allows his *qi* to be unrestrained by force, he will become domineering and harsh.

The *Transmission* says: *"The first drum strike fills them with resolve; the second weakens their vigor; the third leaves them exhausted."* This illustrates that those who exhaust their *qi* cannot endure long.

Again, the strong grow old, the old become infirm, and the infirm are bent. The meaning lies here as well, so the warning is to cease early and not repeat their actions.

**Chapter on the Silent Wisdom of the Knowing (Chapter 56)**
True Statement from the Minister says: When one employs the *Dao/Way* in warfare, the knowing must not speak of its mechanisms, and those who speak do not know its essence. Hence: *"The knowing do not speak, those who speak do not know."*

To block the *yue* (兑) and close the gates is the deepest mechanism of warfare. To blunt sharpness and resolve chaos, to harmonize light with dust—these are the most critical essences of warfare, both beyond utterance.

Thus it is called *"Mysterious Harmony"* (玄同). The sage’s teachings are such that in war he conquers, in defense he holds firm; none under the heavens can oppose him.

Yet he does not dare lightly treat his enemies, so the near and far cannot be distinguished, nor can those who are favored or hated, nor those who bring benefit or harm, be singled out. Thus he is held in esteem and reverence by all under the heavens.

**Chapter on Governing the Realm with Politics (Chapter 57)**
True Statement from the Minister says: To govern a realm is to employ *politics* (政), and *politics* means rectitude. When the ruler leads with rectitude, who dares not be rectified?

To wage war is to employ the *unexpected* (奇), and the *unexpected* is *strategic flexibility* (权). When this aligns with the *Dao/Way*, what harm can the ordinary suffer?

*"To take the world with non-action"*—non-action here means no warfare or conflict, hence: *"How do I know the world must be so? By this."*

Again: *"The world abounds with taboos because rulers fish and hunt, exhaust the marshes, and close many paths. Wealth is not sufficient for the people, benefits do not flow downward, so the people grow ever poorer—this is indeed fitting."*

If the ruler allows all under the heavens to freely exercise their schemes and wield their sharp tools, it is nothing but folly—folly is akin to chaos, and when the people are skilled in deceit, strange things proliferate, unsettling the ruler’s heart.

When laws and decrees multiply, thieves and robbers abound, and the people no longer fear death.

Thus the sage says: *"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves."* Meaning: If there is no warfare or conflict, the people will be at ease and naturally transform.

*"I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich."* Meaning: If there are no taxes or labor services, the people will prosper daily.

*"I love stillness, yet the people become rectified."* Meaning: Returning to the root and following the *Way*, the people will naturally be rectified.

*"I have no desires, yet the people remain simple."* Meaning: If one is not swayed by cravings, the people will naturally be simple.

**Chapter on the Obscure Governance (Chapter 58)**
True Statement from the Minister says: The *Way* of the ruler must conceal his brilliance, broaden his teachings, and remain ever in a state of *"obscure governance"* (闷闷). Then the people will naturally be simple and unadorned.

If the ruler above holds a harsh and scrutinizing mind, those below will inevitably deceive him, act insincerely, and seek only to evade punishment.

Again, fortune leans on misfortune, misfortune hides within fortune—only summoned by human actions, arising from circumstances. The fields of victory and defeat, the pursuit of favor and disgrace, whether one meets or repels, whether one prospers or suffers—all must be shared. From oneself to the family, from the family to the realm, extending to all under the heavens—whether great or small, all require caution, for this is where fortune and misfortune intertwine.

Moreover, the nature of people is to rejoice in fortune’s arrival but rarely to fear misfortune’s onset. Even when misfortune strikes, they ponder ten thousand schemes for fortune; when in fortune’s embrace, they guard not against misfortune’s return. Hence: *"Who knows its limits?"*

Worse yet, if the ruler treats rectitude as evil and goodness as demonic, then: *"The people’s delusion is indeed long-lasting."* Thus the sage abides by his own principles, neither cutting nor being cut by others. He guards his own purity, yet does not defile the customs of the people. He bends himself to uplift others, hence: *"Straight yet not domineering."* He conceals his brilliance and employs obscurity, hence: *"Bright yet not dazzling."*

**Chapter on Governing the People and Serving Heaven (Chapter 59)**
True Statement from the Minister says: *"Frugal"* (啬) is akin to *"love"* (爱). The ruler’s governance of the people and service to Heaven must center on *virtue/power* (德) and benevolence, hence: *"Nothing surpasses frugality."*

When the *Dao/Way* of benevolence is practiced, the world will quickly submit. The world quickly submitting is called *"heaping up virtue"* (重积德), and those who heap up virtue will conquer all in war and hold firm in defense, hence: *"None cannot be overcome."* If none can be overcome, then *"who knows its limits?"* If none knows its limits, one may have a realm. Having a realm is the foundation for enduring long.

The *"foundation"* refers to the *Dao/Way*, meaning that if the ruler guards his realm with the *Dao/Way*, its roots and foundations will naturally be deep and firm, allowing him to enjoy the blessings of longevity and lasting vision.

**End of Volume Three on the Essential Principles of War from the *Dao/Way* and *Virtue* Classic. Begin Volume Four.**

「The *Essential Principles of War* from the *Dao/Way* and *Virtue* Classic* continues:

*"The Minister of War, holding the seal of command and overseeing the armies of Han State, governs as the Prefect of Han and leads the *Threatening Victory Military Mission*, bearing the crimson fish pouch—this is the sixth chapter on *Governance of a Great Realm* (治大国章第六十) as explained by your servant, Wang Zhen.*

Your servant, Wang Zhen, states: *"Those who rule the world and its states should govern with the ease of cooking a small fish—calm and unperturbed as their foundation. If they establish calm as their foundation, they will naturally not stray from the *Dao/Way*. When the *Dao/Way* remains unbroken, the cosmic forces of yin and yang harmonize in grand unity. With yin and yang in grand harmony, winds and rains follow their proper seasons, and all living beings find peace. When all living beings are at ease, even malevolent spirits cannot wreak havoc or perform their uncanny deeds. Thus it is said: *'Its spirits are not formidable.'*

Moreover, when a sagely ruler presides, arms do not rise. The faithful and obedient enjoy the blessings of heaven and earth, and so the divine and the virtuous align in mutual accord, their splendor converging in return. Is this not fitting?

**On the *Governance of a Great Realm* as the *Lower Flow* (大国者下流章第六十一):**
Your servant, Wang Zhen, explains: This chapter speaks emphatically of the ruler’s constant practice of humility as his *virtue/power*. How could victory or defeat be sought through military might and brute force?

In the interactions between great and small realms, the principle of nurturing mutual relations and interests must be observed. Examining their logic, does it not simply mean each pursues what it desires?

If each seeks what it desires, then the great must naturally adopt a posture of humility and clarity. The way of humility and modesty always diminishes the high to elevate the low; its efficacy lies in the ruler, not in the ruled. Therefore, the *Classic of Changes* says: *'By honoring the lowly and disdaining the noble, one gains the people.'* This is what it means.

**On the *Dao/Way* as the *Source of All Things* (道者万物章第六十二)."」

**Chapter 61: On the *Dao/Way* of the Great Realm (大国者下流)**

True Statement says: This chapter emphatically declares that the sage-ruler always cherishes humility as his *virtue/power*. How could he seek victory or defeat through arms and raw force?

In the exchanges between great and small realms, the principle of fostering mutual relations and interests must be upheld. Examining their logic, does it not simply mean each pursues what it desires?

If each seeks what it desires, then the great must naturally assume a posture of humility and clarity. The *Dao/Way* of humility and modesty always diminishes the high to elevate the low; its efficacy lies with the ruler, not the ruled. Therefore, the *Classic of Changes* says: *"By honoring the lowly and disdaining the noble, one gains the people."* This is what it means.

---

**Chapter 62: On the *Dao/Way* as the *Source of All Things* (道者万物)**

True Statement says: The sage-ruler treasures this *Dao/Way* because it can safeguard and nurture the people of the world. Among the people of the world, the virtuous are few, while the unvirtuous are many—could he abandon them all?

Thus, the sage-ruler establishes governance, appoints the Three Ministers, strives to restrain arms and warfare, avoids punishments, beautifies speech, and honors conduct, hoping to guide them toward goodness and transform them through principle. Therefore, he is held in esteem by all under heaven.

Why would he bow to jade and horses and seek to compare their superiority? This is the *Dao/Way* of non-action (为无为).

---

**Chapter 63: On the *Dao/Way* of Non-Action (至道之君)**

True Statement says: The ruler who embodies the ultimate *Dao/Way* sits upright and lets governance unfold naturally, hence it is called the *Dao/Way* of non-action (为无为). He lays down arms and avoids contention, hence it is called the *Dao/Way* of treating non-action as action (事无事). He embodies the *Dao/Way* and preserves the spirit, hence it is called the *Dao/Way* of savoring non-savor (味无味).

The hearts of all realms and the nature of myriad people—like winter’s cold and summer’s rain—still evoke sighs of complaint. Yet the ruler’s heart, whether great or small, few or many, must always be guided by *virtue/power* to soothe them, ensuring no resentment or blame arises. Therefore, it is said: *"Repay resentment with virtue."* (报怨以德)

The world’s great difficulties always arise from what is easy, meaning that if a ruler acts with negligence or ease, then calamities will surely emerge from it.

The world’s great undertakings always arise from what is slight, meaning that if a ruler does not value small actions, his great *virtue/power* will ultimately be undermined. Thus, the sage-ruler prevents minor issues from escalating and accumulates small deeds to achieve greatness. If one waits until a matter is already settled or fully grown before acting, it will be too late. Therefore, it is said: *"Only by never treating greatness as great can one achieve true greatness."* (终不为大，乃能成其大)

If one lightly gives promises, trust will be few; if one frequently alters course, difficulties will multiply—this is the natural order of things.

The *Dao/Way* of simplicity is easy to follow, while the folly of negligence breeds difficulty. Thus, the sage-ruler treats even the most difficult matters with utmost caution, and only then can he master all affairs and all schemes without encountering difficulty. Therefore, it is said: *"Only by never treating difficulty as difficult can one overcome it."* (终无难)

---

**Chapter 64: On the *Dao/Way* of Ease and Holding Firm (易持易谋)**

True Statement says: This chapter fully speaks of success and failure resting with humanity, of the *Dao/Way* governing beginning and end, and of why the sage-ruler does not recklessly act to seek quick results. Thus, he dwells in security while contemplating danger, hence it is said: *"Ease in holding firm."* (易持)

He does not defy the natural order of things, hence it is said: *"Ease in planning."* (易谋)

If suddenly there are wicked schemes causing trouble, one must strike at their vulnerable beginnings—breaking them will be easy. If one intercepts their subtle origins, dispersing them will be without difficulty. Therefore, it is said: *"Act before there is a matter to act upon, and govern before there is disorder."* (为之於未有，理之於未乱) This refers to the sage’s foresight and early awareness before things have sprouted or taken form, desiring to act early and fearing their growth into unmanageable difficulties.

Again, great trees grow from fine shoots, high towers rise from small mounds, and long journeys begin with near steps—these three illustrate how small things accumulate to become great, and how near things lead to the distant. If one waits at the edge, hoping for results, then the time of fulfillment will surely come. But if one exceeds proper measure and seeks results prematurely, it will be the burden of hasty desires. Therefore, military campaigns cannot be forced; those who force them will surely bring ruin upon themselves. Weapons cannot be seized; those who seize them will surely lose them. Thus, the sage-ruler does nothing and grasps nothing, so he cannot be ruined or lose—this is clear.

Moreover, common folk always act with excessive doubt, preferring detours when on the path. In waging war or defending the realm, they often bring ruin upon themselves just as victory is in sight. These are all cases of losing sight of the fundamentals and confusing the beginning and end.

Therefore, it is said: *"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed matters."* (慎终如始，则无败事)

Thus, the sage-ruler desires what others do not desire, hence it is said: *"He does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures."* (不贵难得之货) He learns what others do not learn, hence it is said: *"He corrects the errors of the multitude."* (复众人之所过) He seeks to assist all things in their natural unfolding, allowing them to mature effortlessly, and never dares to monopolize or claim exclusive insight, saying: *"He aids the natural unfolding of all things, yet does not dare to act."* (以辅万物之自然，而不敢为)

---

**Chapter 65: On the Ancient Rulers’ Skill in the *Dao/Way* (古之善为道)**

True Statement says: This speaks of the ancient rulers who skillfully embodied the *Dao/Way*. They did not teach the people to have cunning, for cunning hides deceit, nor did they teach them to be straightforward, for straightforwardness lies in their nature. Therefore, it is said: *"The people are difficult to govern because their cunning is excessive."* (人之难治，以其智多)

Again, it is said: *"To govern the realm with cunning is to be the realm’s thief."* (以智治国，国之贼)

What does this mean? The common folk are inherently of shallow and inferior nature, their wisdom and insight undeveloped, while deceit and scheming run rampant, stirring resentment and complaints. How could they discern right from wrong, or know what is proper and what is not? Some swarm like ants in their local cliques, others rise like bees across rivers and mountains. A single wicked instigator plots, and ten thousand follow in chorus. Military campaigns are always launched from such origins.

This does not mean that using cunning to govern the realm is itself the realm’s thief—rather, it means that if the common folk are made cunning, then all will become capable of harming the realm. Thus, to make the people of the world retain their natural simplicity and straightforwardness is to bring true fortune and blessing to the realm.

If the ruler of a realm can always understand these two principles, then he himself becomes the model and standard for all, which is called *"harmonizing with the *virtue/power* of Heaven."* (与天同德)

His profound and distant *virtue/power* is such that if rulers follow and emulate him, all things under heaven will naturally return to their original simplicity. Then the people of the world will surely attain great harmony. Therefore, it is said: *"Only then can great harmony be achieved."* (然后乃至大顺)

**Chapter 66: On the River and Sea as the Sovereign of All Valleys (江海所以能为百谷王)**

True Statement says: This chapter uses the river and sea as an analogy, desiring that the ruler embody the utmost humility, gentleness, and yielding.

The utmost humility, gentleness, and yielding earn the world’s affection. Earning the world’s affection brings boundless joy that does not weary, and boundless joy that does not weary ensures that none under heaven will contend. The principle of non-contention aligns with the *virtue/power* of Heaven, benefiting all things, and does not rely on forced compliance. It flows through the six voids without seeking to dominate, and does not plot to conquer. Moreover, who among the people of the world could contend with one who does not contend? It is impossible.

**Chapter 67: On the Greatness of the Three Treasures (天下皆謂我大)**

True Statement says: This chapter seeks to clarify the essence of the Three Treasures, first illustrating the *Greatness* through its text. The *Greatness* is the manifestation of the Dao/Way, though the common folk do not recognize it, hence they say it resembles the unworthy. This is to urge the ruler to deeply examine the meaning of the Three Treasures, safeguard and uphold them, so first it opens with the principle of giving and taking, to reveal the *virtue/power* of benevolence and frugality. Benevolence makes one courageous, meaning that with one’s own benevolent heart, one gains the world’s loyal devotion—what else could this be but courage? Frugality makes one expansive, meaning that with one’s own frugality and restraint, one attains the world’s wealth—what else could this be but abundance?

Thus, the Three Sovereigns employed it and overcame the Nine Li, the Five Emperors employed it and banished the Four Evildoers, Shang Tang and Wu employed it and conquered the world with arms, and Cheng, Kang, Wen, and Jing employed it so that punishments were all laid aside.

When Jié and Zhòu abandoned it, their states perished; when Yōu and Lǐ abandoned it, they met their deaths. When Qin Shǐ abandoned it, the Two Dynasties were exterminated; when Xiàng Jí abandoned it, his five limbs were severed. When Han Wǔ abandoned it, half the world was in ruin; when Cáo Pōng abandoned it, Wu and Shu stood in opposition. Hence it is said: "Abandon benevolence and lose courage; abandon frugality and lose abundance."

When it says "abandon benevolence," it means to discard love and care for the people, so that they offer no loyal devotion in return. Then, with one’s own daring spirit, one seeks to rival the world’s enmity—how could such boldness ever succeed?

When it says "abandon frugality," it means to lack restraint, to hoard wealth excessively, to indulge in palaces and luxuries, to increase armies and expenditures. When grain and resources are depleted, who can the ruler rely on? Moreover, the Classics say: "Follow your own body and yet lead others," and "To lead others, one must first place oneself behind them." Therefore, the sage never dares to act first for the world, yet ultimately always leads the world.

Thus, the effects of employing benevolence from the Yellow Emperor down to Wen and Jing were as described, and the consequences of abandoning it from Jié and Zhòu down to Cáo Pōng were as seen. Hence it is said: "With benevolence in war, one triumphs; with benevolence in defense, one is secure. When Heaven intends to save, it shields with benevolence." The good warrior does not revel in victory (善为士者不武).

True Statement says: The ruler who embodies the Dao/Way always engages in non-action, practices teaching without words—what need is there for martial prowess? The skilled warrior never suffers defeat, for they must prioritize tranquility and simplicity above all. Though it says "triumph," the sage does not take pride, instead treating it with sorrow, grief, and funeral rites—what room is there for anger?

The virtuous ruler’s *virtue/power* aligns with Heaven and Earth, naturally free from contention. Hence it is said: "The good victor does not contend." The king who regulates expenditures and loves the people, who governs with timely measures, must rely on ministers of assistance—these are compared to limbs and sinews. When employing generals, they kneel to receive the axe, march to advance the chariot—this is to first win their hearts, then their strength.

Hence it is said: "The good user of people acts beneath them," which is the *virtue/power* of non-contention. The *virtue/power* of non-contention can match Heaven and establish the ultimate principle—hence it is called the "Ancient Principle."

**Chapter 68: On the Words of Military Strategy (用兵有言)**

True Statement says: The ruler who follows the Dao/Way cannot speak for themselves, so they borrow the words of military strategy. In war, the one who strikes first is the host, the one who responds is the guest. Moreover, the sage’s use of arms is always as a last resort, so they act only after the enemy does. By acting only after the enemy, they are always the guest.

Advancing little and retreating often is the art of deep strategy, the intention of weighing the enemy carefully. Thus, though enemies may come, we rely on skilled tactics rather than battle formations. When we rely on skilled tactics rather than battle formations, there is no need for conquest—hence it is said: "Action without action." Since there is no need for conquest, our troops embrace righteousness in defense—what need is there for flexing muscles?

The ruler who follows the Dao/Way, even if faced with violent marauders who act recklessly, will first warn them with words, then display martial displays with banners and flags. The enemy will surely retreat upon hearing righteousness, naturally leaving no foe behind—hence it is said: "Yet there is no enemy." Once the enemy retreats, weapons are stored away—hence it is said: "Hold without arms." Though arms are stored away, fearing they may forget war, it is again warned: "No greater calamity than treating the enemy lightly; treating the enemy lightly nearly loses our treasure."

To treat the enemy lightly means to delight in foreign wars while neglecting domestic defenses. Better to delight in foreign wars than neglect domestic defenses, for even in foreign wars there may be victory or defeat, but neglecting domestic defenses will surely lead to annihilation.

Though the sage rules above, they are truly without enemies in the world, yet when the time comes to address chaos and disorder, enemies are indeed many. Why so? The *Book of Documents* says: "Pity me and I will retreat; oppress me and I will stand firm." If so, then the world is my enemy, the state is my enemy, the village is my enemy, the household is my enemy, even my own body is my enemy. Therefore, kings do not slight the humble and lowly, for thus they gain the affection of all nations. Dukes and Marquesses do not humiliate widows and orphans, for thus they gain the affection of the people. Ministers do not abandon their servants, for thus they gain the affection of both great and small. Commoners do not neglect self-cultivation, for thus they gain the affection of sincerity and truth.

Only then can we fully preserve our treasure. Our treasure is our body and our position—hence it is said: "When arms are raised against us, the compassionate will triumph." All that is spoken of as "compassion" is the expression of benevolent love from a sincere heart. If the ruler harbors a benevolent heart, does not fail in treating ministers with proper rites, and the people respond with loyalty and courage, exhausting all duties owed to their lord—then how could they ever be defeated? Hence it is said: "The compassionate will triumph."

My words are very easy to understand—

「My true words are: The benefits and harms of the world are nothing greater than those from warfare. Therefore, the Way of the ruler is earnest and sincere, and in the previous chapters, I have already exhaustively spoken of the importance of warfare and the dangers of enemies. Yet I still fear that later generations may not comprehend it, so in this chapter I again emphasize: My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.

Moreover, it is said: "Words have a root, deeds have a master." *Root* refers to the foundation, *master* refers to the guardian. This means that all my spoken words have their foundational principles, and all my actions have their guiding masters. Yet people fail only in knowing and practicing them. Hence the lament: "Few know me, those who follow me are honored."

*Honored* is also like *few*. Since people cannot recognize and follow my teachings, this is why the Way and virtue cannot be put into practice. Because the Way and virtue cannot be put into practice, the Sage remains hidden in obscurity while storing brilliance within, adhering to the principle of "dwelling without emerging." Hence it is said: "Clad in coarse garments, yet holding jade within." (See Chapter 71 for the explanation of *knowing the unknown*.)

My true words are: One who knows what they know yet does not speak of it is superior among men. Conversely, one who does not know what they know yet insists on speaking of it is afflicted with a malady. Thus, recognizing this false knowledge as a disease means one will not fall ill. As for the critical moment in warfare, only the Sage and the Virtuous can truly grasp it. (See Chapter 72 for *The people do not fear authority*.)

My true words are: Great authority is the strength of arms and soldiers. If commoners have no fear, then punishments and penalties will follow; if ministers have no fear, then disgrace and humiliation will follow; if lords have no fear, then arms and soldiers will follow. Again, the scriptures say: "Do not fear what others fear," which carries the same meaning. Moreover, I warn those in high positions: They should cultivate a broad and magnanimous heart, lest their nature become narrow and constricted. They must not despise the natural purpose of their own lives. For if they do not despise their own existence, they will surely value governing others. If they value governing others, the people will gladly submit. Once the people submit willingly, who could possibly resent them? Thus, the ruler must first establish what cannot be resented, and only then can they ensure the people do not resent them. Hence it is said: "Only the one who does not resent can ensure no resentment."

The Sage’s wisdom inherently knows itself—how could they willingly boast of their own talents and display them for others to see? The Sage’s benevolence inherently practices self-love—how could they arrogantly dominate others and exploit things to achieve their own exalted status? Therefore, they abandon the great delusion of self-promotion and self-exaltation, and embrace the vast benefit of self-knowledge and self-love. Hence it is said: "Abandon that, take this."

(See Chapter 73 for *The daring and the reckless lead to slaughter*.)

My true words are: If a ruler is bold yet also fierce and reckless, they will inevitably love warfare and seek to dominate the world, thereby slaughtering many. If a ruler is bold yet not fierce or reckless, they will surely focus on the Dao and govern their realm, thereby preserving the lives of many. Hence it is said: "Knowing these two paths, one brings benefit, the other harm."

Those whom Heaven detests are those who love slaughter. The Sage has long known this. Now I again say that even those who struggle to grasp it should be warned severely. The Sage follows Heaven’s Way and practices the Dao, establishing deeds without action and teaching without words. In the world, who would dare to contend with them? Since there is none to contend with, how could they ever fail to triumph? Hence it is said: "The non-contending will excel in victory."

Heaven responds to human desires swiftly, like the echo of a sound. Cold comes with the summer solstice, heat with the winter solstice—this is not by chance. All things flow in their forms, each fulfilling its nature and destiny—this is not by mere coincidence. The vast and encompassing net of Heaven, the ruler should emulate its laws: Overlook great faults, unless they are truly negligent. Punish even small offenses, unless they are truly without blame. Again, the *Book of Documents* says: "When Heaven inflicts calamity, it can still be averted; but when a man brings calamity upon himself, it cannot be escaped," which carries the same meaning.

(See Chapter 74 for *The people do not fear death*.)

My true words are: When warfare is relentless and punishments are severe, the people will have no refuge. Once the people have no refuge, they will not fear death—this is clear. If they do not fear death, how can they still be held accountable for crimes? The people will escape without shame, and this is their downfall. If the ruler governs through virtue and the Way, the people will cherish life and fear death, naturally harboring shame and restraint. Once they have shame and restraint, if there are still wicked and evil individuals who dare to act strangely and deceptively, then I will seize and execute them. These are the soldiers who create confusion and deceive the masses through their strange and cunning tactics. Yet even so, since they are what Heaven detests, I still cannot act arbitrarily. Hence it is said: "Who dares?"

There are always officials entrusted with execution, and these officials are the agents of Heaven’s net. Moreover, the ruler of all under Heaven must take personal responsibility for crimes committed in every direction, awaiting Heaven’s divine retribution to act. How could they instead vent their emotions and shift their anger, indiscriminately punishing the innocent? Hence it is said: "Even the great carpenter, if they replace another in their work, will rarely avoid injury to their own hands."

(See Chapter 75 for *The people’s hunger*.)

My true words are: When a ruler imposes heavy labor, excessive taxation, and burdensome levies, famine will inevitably arise—this is natural. Again, it is said that those who act will be the rulers who love warfare and military campaigns. If one household has soldiers, then the entire clan will have soldiers; if one clan has soldiers, then the entire village will have soldiers; if one village has soldiers, then the entire realm will have soldiers; if the entire realm has soldiers, chaos will have no end. Then the farmer abandons their tools to wield weapons, the artisan discards their loom to rest in idleness, and in the state of Qi, half the households are of soldiers. Sons, brothers, neighbors, and kinsmen all join the ranks of warriors, together committing atrocities and deceit. Even if they are skillful in persuasion and gentle in manner, who could say it is easy? Hence it is said: "Difficult to govern."

As for those who lightly regard death, it is because their superiors have burdened them excessively, leaving them with no refuge. Thus, they regard death lightly. Hence the lament: "Only those who do not value life are wiser than those who cling to it."*

**Chapter 76: On the Virtue of the People’s Lifespan**
*True’s humble remark:* This chapter further expounds the principle of yielding softness to hardness, pointing to those who perish in the struggle of life and death. In my humble analysis, its profound meaning lies in the warning: *"When military might grows too strong, it cannot be sustained."*

Again, the text below states:
*"When wood is too strong, it splits; when the mighty are placed beneath, the weak rise above."* This is another stern admonition against the perils of excessive military power.

For what reason? Military force is the tool of **凶险** (harsh peril), the means of **斗争** (combat), the domain of confrontation with enemies. Thus, when military might is strong, the ruler need not fear; when the ruler fears not, the generals grow arrogant; when the generals are arrogant, the soldiers turn reckless. A ruler who does not fear, commanding arrogant generals, and generals who lord over brutalized soldiers—before they can even regroup from defeat, how could they ever triumph over their foes? Hence, the decline of the Xia and Shang dynasties saw armies of a hundred thousand perishing to overturn the Four Seas, while the end of Qin Shihuang saw his unified empire lost to the Nine Provinces. Xiang Yu rose to dominance yet fell swiftly, the Xin Dynasty seized power only to collapse immediately, Fu Jian met disaster at the Huai River, and the Tang Emperor Yang perished in the Chu Palace. These are but a few whose armies numbered in the **数兆** (myriad billions) or at least **数亿** (hundreds of millions), all relying on their strength to take victory, yet all proving the truth: *"The stronger cannot prevail."*

Again, military force seeks victory not in difficulty, but in sustaining it. Only the **道之君** (ruler of the Dao/Way) can sustain victory. The failures of these past rulers all stemmed from their inability to hold it, is it not so?

**Chapter 77: On the Dao of Heaven**
*True’s humble remark:* The analogy of the bow drawn in this chapter centers on the principle of **损益** (harmonious balance of loss and gain). It teaches that if sovereigns and lords grasp the critical balance of gain and loss, the world will naturally attain equilibrium.

*The Book of Changes* says: *"How to gather the people? By wealth."* Indeed, wealth is the proper means of governance. To restrain evil is **义** (righteousness), yet those who create wealth are the farmers and artisans, while those who deplete it are the soldiers and warriors. Since those who create wealth are few and those who destroy it are many, this is why the state endures constant deficits while hoarding surplus.

If one transforms soldiers into farmers, reducing the upper while benefiting the lower, then naturally there will be no factions or bias—just equitable application of the **大同** (Great Harmony), and thus it is said: *"Who can offer the world’s surplus to the people? Only those who follow the Dao."* This is the principle of managing wealth to aid and nurture the people.

Even though the Sage can transform the **两仪** (Two Principles—yin and yang), they do not rely on their power; though they can give birth to all things, they do not claim credit for it. They seek to let **阴德** (hidden virtue) act subtly, never boasting of their gains, hence: *"They do not desire to be seen as virtuous."* By **"见贤" (being seen as virtuous)**, it means to exalt oneself and belittle others’ goodness.

**Chapter 78: On the Softness of the World**
*True’s humble remark:* This chapter uniquely draws the analogy of water’s softness overcoming hardness. Testing this principle, we say: Even among the **五行** (Five Phases—wood, fire, earth, metal, water), earth can restrain water, yet in its extreme, earth lies within water—boring through stone, melting gold, conquering all. All rivers flow to the sea, and the Four Seas defer to Heaven. Who could say that hardness has ever prevailed over this? Hence: *"Its power cannot be replaced."* Therefore, the **道君** (ruler of the Dao/Way) deeply laments that the people of the world cannot know this marvelous principle, nor diligently practice it, hence: *"None can know it; none can act upon it."*

Again, it cites the Sage’s words: *"To bear the filth of the state, rather than its calamities,"* meaning that when the people have faults, the ruler takes them upon themselves; when the world has crimes, the ruler bears them all. The heart of a true king indeed embraces this principle, yet it seems inverted, hence: *"Right words appear as wrong."*

**Chapter 79: On Reconciling Great Grievances**
*True’s humble remark:* Heaven nurtures the people, yet great desires arise within their hearts—competing for victory, pursuing gain, turning from righteousness to wickedness. The mighty seek vengeance, the small harbor grudges. Since Heaven pities them, it establishes rulers to bring order, commanding them to reform their flaws. Yet new flaws emerge—how could this be called good? Hence: *"How can this be considered good?"*

Thus, the Sage holds the heart of **德信** (virtue and trustworthiness), practicing the teaching of **"不言之教"** (the unsaid instruction), extending grace to the **九有** (Nine Regions), and pardoning faults across the **万方** (Ten Thousands). **"契" (contract)** refers to virtue and trustworthiness; again, auspicious matters are observed on the left, and all, whether wise or foolish, are treated like cherished children, hence: *"They hold the left contract and do not blame the people."*

If a ruler does not govern the world through the Dao, but instead enforces uniformity with **刑** (punishments) and guides them with **政** (administrative measures), they cannot fully embody the **尽善之道** (principle of perfect goodness). Hence: *"Without virtue to oversee the punishments."* **"司彻" (oversee the punishments)** means to guard the traces of law and order. Again, if a ruler long persists in embodying the Dao to govern the state, then Heaven’s spirits and divine forces will always bless their reign, hence: *"The Dao of Heaven has no favorites; it always aids those of virtue."*

**Chapter 80: On Small States and Few People**
*True’s humble remark:* This chapter speaks of the ruler’s Dao—even in a great and powerful state, they must always humble themselves as small; though they possess the strength of many subjects, they must always demonstrate weakness. To humble oneself as small means to avoid the fault of pride, never losing the path of **谦柔** (humility and softness). To show weakness means to avoid the blame of over-reliance, never neglecting the preparations of defense.

Suppose there are **什人** (ten-man) leaders and **百人** (hundred-man) chiefs within the state, yet they are not employed to foster arrogance. Then the people will cherish their lives and fear death, content in their homelands and unwilling to migrate far.

Again, if **绩饷** (tribute and provisions) are not demanded, then **舟车** (boats and carriages) will have no use, and warfare ceasing means **兵甲** (arms and armor) will not be displayed. Naturally, the people will attain **太平** (Great Peace) and return to the governance of **结绳之政** (the primitive rule of knotted cords). Thus, they will find their food sweet, their clothing fine, and contentment in their hearts. Their dwellings will be secure, their customs joyful, and **风化** (cultural refinement) will flourish in the age.

「Thus, the neighboring states, though adjacent, harbor no covetous designs, and deceitful scheming is nonexistent. Loyalty and sincerity become their most treasured assets, and they do not indulge in mutual tolerance or private entreaties. Without harboring secret deceits, they sever the customs of envoys and visits, hence it is said: *"The people reach old age and die without ever traveling to one another’s lands."*

**Chapter Eighty-One of *The Beautiful Sayings*:** The subject, Zhen Shu, states: This single chapter expounds the **Dao/Way** by which the ruler, assuming the burden of the **Five Thousand Words** (五千之文), seeks to transmit it across countless generations. It clarifies the brilliance of the sun and moon, aligns **virtue/power** (德) with the **Heaven-Earth** (乾坤), and expounds the **Dao/Way** of the **Primordial Sage** (先天而生), embodying the **Law of the Sage** (法地而理) in its governance. It evaluates the superiority of **virtue/power** (德) and **ren** (仁), weighs the importance of **ritual and righteousness** (礼义), and rejects superficial ornamentation to dwell upon substance. Therefore, it emphasizes three key points and elucidates two principles—these teachings, though originating from the same source, diverge in their applications, serving as profound admonitions for both words and deeds.

For the sincere and trustworthy, there is no pursuit of flattery or boastful cleverness. They reject sweet-talking and ornate speech, eschewing cunning and embellishment. How then could they be deemed beautiful?

**Virtuous conduct and truthful speech are the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.** The Sage upholds and practices them, allowing no room for falsehood or deception to arise.

It is further said: *"The Sage does not accumulate."* This does not mean the Sage does not accumulate at all, but rather that their wealth, though gathered, is dispersed, and their **virtue/power** (德), though accumulated, is put into action. Hence, the following passage speaks of Heaven’s **Dao/Way**: *"To benefit without harming."* Ultimately, it seeks to highlight the Sage’s embodiment of the **Great Virtues of Heaven and Earth** (大德), aiding the principle of **generation and nurturance** (生生之理). Thus, it is said: *"The **Dao/Way** of the Sage is to act without striving."*

Why then is the Sage esteemed for this principle of *"acting without striving"*? The subject believes this chapter is the final one of the **Eighty Sutras** (八十篇), and this sentence is the concluding line of the **Five Thousand Words** (五千文). Therefore, the essence of speech and the governance of affairs are fully realized here.

This does not explicitly distinguish between *"having action"* (有为) and *"non-action"* (无为), but rather states *"acting"* (为) to urge the ruler toward **non-action** (无为), while also ensuring they do not neglect **action** (不为). The meaning is clear.

If a single household refrains from contention, then lawsuits in the state will cease. If a state refrains from contention, then battles and armies will cease. If the world refrains from contention, then wars and conquests will cease. To eliminate lawsuits within the household, battles within the state, and wars across the world—this is the Sage’s governance.

Hence, it is said: *"The **Dao/Way** of the Sage is to act without striving."* This is what it refers to.
