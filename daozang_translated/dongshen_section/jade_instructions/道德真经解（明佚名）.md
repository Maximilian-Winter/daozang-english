*Title:* **Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing***. An anonymous commentary. Three volumes: upper, middle, and lower.
*Source of the base text:* The *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), in the *Dongshen* (Cave Spirits) section under the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.

**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing***
The Sage knows that the divine treasury is tranquil and obscure,
the Dao lies in the distant and unfathomable.
It permeates the Six Vacuities,
yet none can truly grasp its nature.
It responds to myriad transformations,
yet who dares to fathom its traces?

Then it is ever-present yet seemingly void—
the One going, the One coming, while remaining fundamentally empty.
It is ever-creative yet ever-transforming—
the One forming, the One manifesting, while remaining fundamentally true.
How could there be words to engage in idle debate?

The Sage remains silent and reflects upon it,
yet even the most enlightened minds, when aligned with common sentiment, are bound by folly—
they must be guided before they move.
Even the most refined natures, when clouded by ignorance, must be instructed before they awaken.
Thus, the Sage has spoken through the square-bound volumes,
transmitting it to the immortal ages,
as a remedy for eternal goodness.

Across the span of a thousand years,
the Dao has grown ever more distant.
The intent of the ancient Sage
is lost to those who are dim-witted;
the utter truth of his words
is incomprehensible to the foolish.

Now, consider the writings of my venerable Lord Lao:
His words are clear yet his meaning profound,
his text simple yet his purpose subtle.
If not elucidated and its significance clarified,
the common people will regard it as distant as the heavens,
unable to discern it as vividly as crimson and emerald.

Thus, I now undertake this commentary to reveal the great Dao,
having reached the dusty world through practice and transformation.
Perhaps this may serve as a guiding light.

**Commentary on the *Dao De Zheng Jing*, Volume One**
An anonymous commentary.

**Chapter One: "The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of"**

The Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.
To give life and take it in due season—this is the Dao of things;
To cultivate virtue and deeds—this is the Dao of humanity;
To distinguish male and female—this is the Dao of the family;
To establish laws and measures—this is the Dao of the state.
These are the Constant Dao of the world,
Shared by both Sage and commoner alike.

Yet the Dao that can be spoken of—
Responsive without hindrance, boundless in its transformations,
Neither ear nor eye can grasp its subtle essence:
To perceive its faintest traces is to fathom its divine metamorphosis;
To know its farthest reach is to penetrate its unfathomable truth.
In motion, it responds to ten thousand affairs;
In stillness, it does not stagnate in one form—
How could the Constant Dao ever be thus?

The Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.
The Eternal Name does not cling to form—
For form has cycles of flourishing and decline;
The Eternal Name does not reside in numbers—
For numbers have limits and must change.
Thus, the Name that can be named cannot be seized,
Cannot be mirrored in likeness,
Cannot be followed to see its beginning or end—
Pierced from above or below, it remains firm,
Its height beyond reach.
It does not conform to things yet remains fixed,
Its substance is functional,
Existing in the Constant Non-being,
In harmony with the Dao—
And thus the Name arises, yet it is not the Eternal Name.

Non-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
Being is the mother of ten thousand things.
Before the Dao was distinguished,
Neither yin nor yang could be spoken of,
Nor could creation and transformation be traced.
When *qi* settled in clarity, it became Heaven;
When *qi* settled in turbidity, it became Earth.
Heaven and Earth, in their dual attainment,
Called clarity *yang*—the power to create—
And turbidity *yin*—the power to transform—
Thus all things are born.

In Non-being, the Dao stands alone, and Heaven and Earth attain it—
This is why Non-being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
In Being, Heaven and Earth unite, and all things are born—
This is why Being is the mother of ten thousand things.
At the beginning, it is spoken of as *qi*;
As the mother, it is spoken of as form—
*Qi* and form—
Also the Dao’s Being and Non-being.

To observe its mystery, one must hold fast to Non-being;
To observe its limits, one must hold fast to Being.
These two, though differing in name, arise from the same source—
Both called *Xuan* (the Profound).
The Profound, again the Profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.
It comes indistinctly—from where does it come?
It departs indistinctly—where does it go?
Empty, yet not lodged in any single thing;
Void, yet not reflected in any single form—
This is the Constant Non-being.

It comes indistinctly—yet its coming must have a manifestation;
It departs indistinctly—yet its departure must have a substance.
Empty, yet the spirit gathers within it—
Motionless yet moving.
Void, yet the True is contained—
Unchanging yet transforming—
This is the Constant Being.

Constant Non-being is the practice of *wuwei* (non-action);
Constant Being is the cultivation of action.
Non-action leads to the Mysterious,
Action leads to the Manifest—
These two, though differing in name, arise from the same source.

In essence, can they not both be called *Xuan*?
For *Xuan* is the Dao made visible—
Like the sky’s hue, seen yet its nature unknown.
The Profound, again the Profound—
To attain it again and again,
And to penetrate it ever deeper—
Thus it is called the gateway to all mysteries,
For it enters and exits the Great Dao.

**Chapter Two: "When All Under Heaven Know"**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Then ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness,
Then wickedness arises.
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low contrast each other,
Harmony and discord blend,
Before and after follow.
The Dao disperses through affairs,
Things intermingle in nature.
At first, they receive the True,
Yet humanity corrupts it into falseness;
At first, they inherit harmony,
Yet it becomes discordant.
Thus, what was once beautiful becomes ugly,
What was once good becomes ungood—
The two paths of beauty and ugliness,
Goodness and ungoodness, diverge.

The Sage does not, because of ugliness, cease to recognize beauty,
Nor, because of ungoodness, cease to recognize goodness—
Only to fulfill their nature,
Not to follow the common crowd in distinguishing beauty from ugliness,
Goodness from ungoodness.
If one seeks to unify them,
Then nature attains its utmost—
And what of being and non-being,
Difficulty and ease,
Long and short,
High and low,
Harmony and discord,
Before and after?
This is the Sage’s teaching,
And thus it is practiced.

Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action,
Teaches through non-speech.
The Sage governs himself with the Dao,
And bestows deeds upon others.
For those without foresight,
They await the Sage to think for them;
For those without insight,
They await the Sage to see for them.
If not guided by teaching,
They grow soft and drown themselves,
Foolish and weaken themselves,
Unable to follow the Sage’s Dao.

I store my spirit in profound silence,
Yet let them move with the wind’s influence;
I dwell in still contemplation,
Yet let them act in response to transformation.
To ponder affairs exhausts one’s clarity—
I have no affairs;
To speak much disrupts the True thread—
I speak not.
Naturally, affairs are accomplished below,
Teaching established above—
And though the people are not commanded, they act in harmony,
For there is no reversal of the Dao.

All things act without complaint,
The Sage emerges, and all things emerge;
The Sage withdraws, and all things withdraw.
The Sage is what all things behold.
Thus, when the Sage is above,
All things flourish yet each fulfills its nature,
Without blame for losing their essence.
For I do not exert my mind—
Only to follow the natural order of things,
Until rise and fall have no words to describe them.

If governance is unrefined,
If teaching is unclear,
Then the Sage must emerge and withdraw,
Must take and give as needed—
Disturbing the hearts of all under Heaven,
Disordering the forms of all things.
Even then, though acting, there is no complaint.

The myriad things act without complaint,
Yet this too awaits the Sage’s age.

Born yet not possessed,
Acting yet not relying,
Accomplished yet not dwelling—
Only because one does not dwell does one not depart.

The Great Dao’s establishment
does not divide by self and other,
nor by high and low,
but through mind reaching mind,
the hearts of all under Heaven become my heart;
through form nourishing form,
the shapes of all things become my form—
then what need is there for divided intent?

The Sage embodies the Dao to aid all things,
bends himself to await others,
conceals my skill to remedy their clumsiness,
extends my ability to guide their vulgarity—
thus his deeds reach the boundless,
his achievements become sublime,
fixed as they cannot be surpassed.

The Sage fears excess and overflow,
so he restrains it;
fears fullness and loss,
so he diminishes it.
Great and pervasive, yet not self-satisfied,
wondrous and unfathomable, yet not self-deified—
born yet not born,
acting yet not acting,
achieving yet not claiming achievement—
thus things cannot displace me,
times cannot shift me,
and I abide in the Dao—
hence I do not depart.

**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**

Not exalting the virtuous, so the people do not contend;
Not treasuring rare goods, so the people do not steal;
Not displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not乱 (*luan*—be disordered).
Thus the Sage’s governance:
empties the mind, fills the belly,
weakens the will, strengthens the bones.
Ever keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,
so that even the wise dare not act.

Acting without acting—
then nothing remains ungoverned.

By nature, distinctions are none,
yet habit shifts them;
by nature, things are one,
yet emotion divides them.
Habit alters nature, so the virtuous are ever what others emulate;
emotion divides things, so rare goods are ever what others seek.
To emulate the virtuous yet fall short—
this only breeds contention.
To seek goods yet lack them—
this only breeds theft.
These two things cause the people to lose their nature and act in vain knowledge,
to nurture emotion and indulge in false desires—
how then can they see my Dao?

Better to keep their hearts empty—
so virtue and vulgarity do not linger within,
and self and other are undivided;
their bellies filled with abundance,
so finery does not tempt without,
and clothing and food suffice;
their will weakened, to soften themselves and not vie with others;
their bones strengthened, to stand firm and not indulge in worldly gain.

Thus, when the people of the world have no false knowledge to see by,
and the people of the world have no frivolous desires to seek,
then the Sage’s actions will leave nothing ungoverned.

Therefore, the chapter *"Not Exalting the Virtuous"* restores human nature,
reverses the ways of things,
and takes root in the Dao.

**Chapter Four: The Dao is Void Yet Applied**

The Dao is void yet applied—
sometimes it does not fill.

When the Dao expands, it suffices the four quarters yet is not full;
when the Dao contracts, it hides in the minutest things yet is not minute.

In essence, it attains supreme emptiness—
all that comes to it finds response.
In application, it attains supreme transformation—
all that arrives finds reception.

It does not tower too high—
for the low cannot reach it;
it does not stoop too low—
for the high cannot descend to it.
Thus, not only does it not fill,
but it also does not endure long—
unless one abides in the balance of yin and yang,
how could this be possible?

Hence it is said:
*The Dao is void yet applied—
sometimes it does not fill.*

Voidness means the balance of yin and yang,
free from excess or deficiency.

Profound, it seems the origin of all things.
Deep and unfathomable—this is called *profound*;
subtle and inexhaustible—this is called *Dao*.

When the Dao is absent, heaven and earth take it as their beginning;
when the Dao is present, all things take it as their mother.
Speak of it as mother, and one knows all things arise from the Dao;
speak of it as origin, and one knows all things derive from the Dao.
Yet if it is their origin, why say it *seems* so?
For the Dao has no form—
it cannot be defined by a fixed body,
thus it is said: *Profound, it seems the origin of all things.*

Blunt its sharpness, resolve its entanglements,
soften its brilliance, harmonize with its dust—
serene, it seems to exist.

When one abides in the Dao,
restraining the mind’s wildness in emptiness,
settling the nature’s source in stillness,
concealing joy and anger in the realm of non-doing,
locking likes and dislikes in the land of non-thought,
then one dwells in simplicity within oneself,
and meets things with tranquility.

Not displaying clarity outwardly,
it harmonizes yet seems obscure;
not standing apart from the crowd,
it unifies yet seems foolish.

Thus, in the Dao,
one sees without looking,
accomplishes without acting,
and bears no burden of things.

If one does not blunt its sharpness and instead relies solely on intention,
one will surely grow light and injure one’s nature;
if one does not resolve its entanglements and instead relies solely on affairs,
one will surely be troubled and disrupt one’s true essence;
if one does not soften its brilliance, the Dao will fail through arrogance;
if one does not harmonize with its dust, reputation will fail through arrogance.

Thus, in the Dao,
one looks yet does not see,
acts yet does not accomplish,
and is always burdened by things—
those who study it should not be negligent!

This is why, after the four practices,
it is followed by: *Serene, it seems to exist.*

The Dao has no fixed form—
if one speaks of it merely as *existing*,
it is not the Dao,
thus it is said *seems to exist*.

I do not know whose child I am—
I precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.

Observing the Dao’s origin,
it arises from non-action,
is born of purity and stillness,
is held onto and preserved,
abandoned and lost.
It does not forcefully multiply,
nor does it weakly diminish—
thus, it attains the utmost of emptiness,
the marvel of true constancy.
Though heaven and earth take me as their beginning,
though all things take me as their origin,
I manifest in the unfathomable,
I probe what has no precedence—
that is the image of form.
I dwell in the initial state of formlessness,
I reside above the realm of things—
how could I be named as a child?
Thus it is said: *I do not know whose child I am—
I precede the Sovereign of the Primordial.*

**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**

Heaven and earth are not benevolent—
they treat all things as sacrificial straw dogs.
The Sage is not benevolent—
they treat the people as sacrificial straw dogs.

Between heaven and earth,
it is like a bellows, is it not?
Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever producing.

Heaven and earth, toward all things,
let their natural order take its course.
When their time to live comes, they give life,
nourishing them with dew and rain;
when their time to die comes, they bring death,
withering them through frost and snow.
Thus, they are not bound to any single thing,
nor burdened by any single time—
they simply await the unfolding of their nature.

They are called *straw dogs* because,
when sacrifices are made,
they are offered with utmost sincerity and reverence.
But once the rites are over,
they are discarded as worthless—
treated like dung and filth.
This is not about loving them more at first and less at the end,
nor cherishing them before and hating them after—
it is simply the way of their nature.

The Sage’s relation to the people is no different.
When love is given, it is like cherishing an infant;
when respect is given, it is like receiving a grand sacrifice—
no love is greater than this.

But when there are those not loved,
punishment is meted out to display authority,
and life is regarded as trivial.
When there are those not respected,
executions are carried out to eliminate guilt,
and existence is seen as insignificant—
this is not the Sage’s sentiment toward rewards and punishments,
but rather the natural unfolding of their order,
in harmony with heaven and earth.

If it were otherwise,
how could one receive all things without exhaustion,
or embrace all changes without drowning?

To love life is to give life without depletion;
to desire goodness is to foster goodness without end.
Its responses are boundless,
its emergence inexhaustible—
like the bellows, ever producing.
Thus it is said: *Empty yet unyielding,
moving yet ever producing.*

Many words lead to exhaustion—
better to hold to the center.

The Sage acts by applying the Dao,
and remains still by embodying the Dao.
In stillness, they align with the Dao,
serene and self-nourishing,
not engaging with affairs,
not interfacing with things—
what harm could words bring?

When they act and apply the Dao,
no words suffice to meet the changes—
then the Dao reaches its limits.
Though words may be praised,
they must be concise to fit the principle,
essential to align with the Dao,
not indulging in excess for its own sake.
Thus it is said: *Many words lead to exhaustion—
better to hold to the center.*
Is this not the way?

**Chapter Six: The Unending Valley Spirit**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
this is called the Mysterious Feminine.
The gate of the Mysterious Feminine
is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.

Endless as silk, yet ever present,
its use requires no toil.
Empty yet responsive—
its response is boundless;
wondrous yet unfathomable—
its measure has no bounds.

For the Valley is that which responds to all things
yet clings to none.
The Spirit is that which receives all transformations
yet lingers in no origin.

Not clinging to any thing,
its emptiness never fills—
what loss could there be?
Not lingering in any origin,
its transformation never exhausts—
what end could there be?

Thus the Valley Spirit bears the sign of immortality—
this is called the Mysterious Feminine.

The Dao in its relation to humanity
begins with the formless and ends with the formed.
The formless is spoken of as *qi*,
the formed is illustrated by shape.
The Mysterious Feminine is the formed aspect of this.

Within the human body, the Mysterious Feminine is the source of life.
Empty, it responds to our movements;
wondrous, it perfects our transformations.
That which descends returns through it,
that which departs returns through it.
Thus the vital *qi* flows unbroken,
the true essence remains tranquil—
and the principle of longevity is realized.

Yet why cannot humanity live?
Not because the Mysterious Feminine is lacking—
but because humanity cannot be empty and still.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven’s Duration, Earth’s Longevity**

Heaven endures, Earth persists.
Heaven and Earth endure and persist
because they do not generate themselves—
thus they attain eternal life.

Therefore the Sage places his body last
and yet his body is first;
sets his body aside
and yet his body is preserved.
Is this not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his own nature.

His essence is supremely high—
he aids all living beings yet claims none.
This is how Heaven endures.
His nature is vast and thick—
he bears all things yet does not refuse.
This is how Earth persists.

Heaven endures, covering all ages without tipping;
Earth persists, bearing past and present without sinking.
This is not because Heaven and Earth inherently endure and persist—
rather, they do not claim their own life,
and thus endure naturally.

The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth,
aspires to eternal life—
how could he dare claim his own body?
Thus he lowers himself to the lowly,
harmonizes his brilliance with the common,
though knowing he is first,
he does not dare to lead others
but always remains behind.
Though his body is sage,
he does not dare to surpass others
but always conceals his traces.
Thus he places his body last and yet his body is first;
sets his body aside and yet his body is preserved.
Therefore he fulfills his own nature
and aligns with Heaven and Earth’s enduring longevity.

If not for this selflessness,
how could one speak of this?

**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**

The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend—
it dwells where others disdain,
and thus approaches the Dao.

It rests in lowly places,
its heart is deep,
its giving is kind,
its words are trustworthy,
its governance is effective,
its actions are capable,
its movements are timely.

Only because it does not contend
does it incur no blame.

In the past, the Dao was above—
indistinct yet without form,
without distinction,
yet its purity was undefiled.
When it separated from the formless and entered the formed,
in terms of nature, goodness remained;
in terms of the Five Phases, water emerged—
and goodness and water thus drew near to the Dao.
This is why they are compared and established,
hence it is said: *The supreme good is like water.*

Goodness is called nature—
forgetting the mind and entering stillness,
clearing oneself to benefit others,
hiding the roots of contention,
as if it were inherent—
no taking, no giving,
as if natural.
When sought, it responds,
yet does not respond to frivolous seeking.
When still, it gradually clears,
yet does not clear through forced stillness.
Deep in its own understanding,
bright yet guarding obscurity,
it reaches the benevolence of aiding others,
the certainty of trust,
the governance of following principle,
the capability of adapting to change—
all are the unifying work of water.

In essence, this chapter conveys
the meaning of *upper virtue not being virtue*,
*upper worthies having no contention*.

For instance:
To rest in lowly places—
one must descend to the low.
A heart that is deep—
water deepens and flows back.
Giving that is kind—
benefiting all things.
Words that are trustworthy—
not deceiving others externally.
Governance that is effective—
grasping softness to overcome hardness.
Actions that are capable—
ferrying all with boats and oars.
Movements that are timely—
acting when it should, stopping when it should.

All these virtues—
if one clings to them and strives to surpass others,
one is bound to incur blame.
How could one then approach the Dao?

---

**Chapter Nine: Filling to the Brim**

Filling to the brim
is not as good as stopping in time;
sharpening to a point
cannot be long preserved.

The Dao as a thing—
when measured, it is never exhausted;
when poured, it never overflows.
No lack makes it insufficient,
no excess makes it redundant.
All is emptied within to avoid fullness,
hollowed within to receive things—
why cling to fullness as if it were restraint?

If one clings to fullness,
it is better to stop in time.
The affairs of the world
come and go in cycles,
new replacing old,
their appearances and disappearances too numerous to count,
their benefits and harms too mixed to calculate with intelligence.

If one strains the heart to respond to endless affairs,
exhausts thought to await irregular things—
even with the cleverness of measuring,
the sharpness of honing,
there will still be a time of depletion.

Those who follow the Dao are not thus.
They abandon worldly entanglements in affairs,
preserve their true nature in non-action—
then what they enjoy
endures in preservation.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them;
wealth and honor lead to arrogance,
and one brings ruin upon oneself.

Viewing things through the Dao,
the Dao is true, things are false;
viewing things through virtue,
virtue is enduring, things are fleeting.

The Perfect One nourishes virtue with the Dao,
refines the Dao with virtue,
and always stands above all things,
finding joy in virtue and the Dao.
Knowing all things are false,
they merely weary the mind—
what is gold and jade,
if viewed by the Perfect One,
but borrowed things?
Why treasure them?

「If one treasures them, how can there be no calamity? When achievement is complete and reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Dao of Heaven. The seasons cannot always be in motion; when they move, there must be a pause. Affairs cannot always flourish; when they rise, there must be decline. Yet human advancement and retreat have their proper *yì* (義), which can be followed but not defied; departure and approach follow one’s *mìng* (命), which can be aligned with but not contradicted. If one can retreat when *yì* demands it yet advances against *yì*, harm will surely follow. If one can depart when *mìng* requires it yet clings to what *mìng* rejects, loss will surely come. How can one rely on advancement to secure lifelong honor, yet ignore the specter of sorrow and misfortune? This is the way of achievement complete, reputation fulfilled, and withdrawal—Heaven’s Dao.

**Chapter 10: On Nourishing the Vital Essence and Embracing Oneness**
Can one nourish the vital essence and embrace oneness without separation?
Since receiving one’s *mìng* (命), the Perfect One preserves their *shén* (神) afterward. Within one body, yin and yang are complete; in the four great elements, creation and transformation are whole. Their nature attains the harmony of *érchōng* (爾沖), and their *qì* (氣) returns to its true and authentic essence. What then is the harm of external things?
This is the principle of life.

Yet when the *shén* (神) follows change and transformation, thoughts arise from things, desires sprout in the chest, and toil lingers within the body. The harmony they once held shifts to discord, and the true essence becomes perverted into falsehood. Then the *shén* (神) is seized by the *pò* (魄), unable to nourish it, and thus disperses and scatters, failing to preserve itself—this is the way of death.

The Perfect One knows this to be so. They forget worldly concerns, extinguish the dusty mind, and recognize that the *shén* (神) is their sovereign. Thus, they remain tranquil and undisturbed, reaching clarity. Knowing that the vital essence is their foundation, they stay at peace and unshaken, attaining oneness. Only then does their *shén* (神) penetrate to the numinous and not be deceived, their vital essence preserved in authenticity and becoming dual—internally free from the *pò* (魄)’s burden, externally free from things’ sway. Then the Dao will not soon perish.

Alas, the foolish and ignorant! They turn their backs on yang and face yin, extinguish the *shén* (神) and submit to the *pò* (魄), racing through endless change and labor, yet failing to guard the Perfect One’s vital essence. When death comes, they sink into the yin Dao, falling into the realm of *yìshēng* (異生). This is because they are burdened by the *pò* (魄) yet cannot embrace oneness to preserve themselves. How lamentable! How lamentable!

**Chapter 11: On Concentrating the Vital Essence and Attaining Softness**
Can one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness like an infant?
Humans preserve life by nourishing their *qì* (氣); they hasten death by depleting their *qì* (氣).
The noble does not harm life by harming others, so they concentrate the vital essence to attain softness, preserving their true nature.

Moreover, the Perfect One’s nature is accustomed to stillness; movement brings sorrow and joy. The Perfect One’s nature is content with non-contradiction; contradiction sparks violent rage. Sorrow and joy arise, and the emotions within become disordered; violent rage stirs, and the *qì* (氣) within becomes agitated. Such is the way of those who fail to nourish the true.

How then does one concentrate the vital essence to attain softness?
Nothing surpasses directing it with the will, guiding it with the *shén* (神), keeping the heart in purity and tranquility, and focusing the will on emptiness and ease. Binding the five thieves in the land of no attachment, imprisoning *wúmíng* (無明) in the realm of utter weakness—only then does the *qì* (氣) align with softness and remain unmoved by external stimuli. What else could this be but the state of an infant?

**Chapter 12: On Purifying and Illuminating the Mysterious**
Can one purify and illuminate without flaw?
The nature has its filth, which can be cleansed; the nature has its impurities, which can be removed.
Unless one cultivates purity to nourish themselves and stillness to face things, how could this be?

**Chapter 13: On Loving the People and Governing the State**
Can one love the people and govern the state without action?
Governance rooted in non-action (*wúwéi* 無為) spawns falsehood from contrivance (*yǒuzuò* 有作). When humans stray from their nature, they lose their foundation; when enslaved by things, they lose themselves.
To love the people and preserve life, to govern the state and maintain lasting peace, nothing surpasses letting them dwell in their nature and not act.

**Chapter 14: On the Opening and Closing of the Heavenly Gate**
Can one act as the feminine in the opening and closing of the Heavenly Gate?
All things enter and exit through Heaven’s gate; Heaven’s gate opens and closes through the Dao.
The Perfect One responds to Heaven’s gate, entering and exiting the mysterious realm, traversing the Dao’s threshold while ascending and descending in the true world. They harmonize with the ebb and flow of time, aligning with things’ waxing and waning—not through arbitrary action, but by dwelling in heartless stillness.

**Chapter 15: On Clarity and Fourfold Reach**
Can one be clear and fourfold without knowing?
To illuminate the hidden is clarity; to perceive the unadorned is whiteness; to flow unrestricted is fourfold reach. Such is true knowing.
Yet knowing while not knowing—this is the utmost.

**Chapter 16: On Nurturing and Tending**
To nurture and tend—giving birth without possession, acting without reliance—
the Dao has its creative force, by which all things are born;
the Dao has its transformative power, by which all things are sustained.
Yet the Dao can nurture and tend to all things only if one truly comprehends it. Otherwise, it cannot be imitated.

**Chapter 17: On the Long and the Unharmed**
To grow long without slaughter—this is called the mysterious *dé* (德).
To endure for ten thousand generations without wear—this is the Dao. Is it not long?
Non-action yet all things transform—is this not without slaughter?

**Chapter 18: On the Thirty Spokes and the Single Hub**
Three hundred spokes converge at a single hub; when the hub is absent, the wheel’s use remains. Clay is molded into vessels; when the void is absent, the vessel’s utility is lost. Doors and windows are carved for rooms; when the void is absent, the room’s stability is gone. Thus, the presence of things brings utility, but the void brings true use.

The wheel has the principle of movement and turning yet does not cling to matter; vessels have the name of gathering yet do not scatter outward; rooms are the constant dwelling place and achieve inner tranquility. These are but examples of the use of the void.

Moreover, what exists beyond form is called the Dao; what exists below form is called things.
When the Dao is beyond form, non-action is its use—its use is boundless, and there is no depletion from new or old.
When things are below form, their presence brings utility—yet utility is finite, and they incur blame from rise and fall.
This is why, speaking of the wheel, the absence of the hub yields the wheel’s use; speaking of vessels, the absence of the void yields their utility; speaking of rooms, the absence of the void yields their stability.»

The Mysterious Dao Explained

If we speak of the profound, then the one that circulates my *qi* is the **Hé Chē** (River Wheel), the one that gathers my *zhēn* (true essence) is the **Dǐng Qì** (Crucible Vessel), and the one that houses my spirit is the **Jiàng Shì** (Vermilion Chamber). These three—how are they truly used? They are employed through *wuwei* (non-action).

**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**

The five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five flavors dull the palate. The true essence does not fail to preserve itself within, and nature does not fail to return to its origin—yet the reason it cannot is that it is constantly seduced by external things.

The eyes fix upon sight, yet I would use wisdom to perceive its true color—yet I do not see, for the colors of things blind me. The ears fix upon sound, yet I would use steadfastness to hear its true voice—yet I do not hear, for the sounds of things deafen me. The mouth fixates upon taste, yet I would use utmost simplicity to know its true flavor—yet I do not know, for the flavors of things dull me.

When the eyes reach blindness and close wisdom’s gaze, when the ears reach deafness and shatter steadfastness, when the mouth reaches dullness and cannot dwell in simplicity, the nine perversions arise, and the true essence is lost. Thus, the common man—how can he speak of the Dao?

Hunting and chasing game drive the mind to madness, and coveting rare treasures obstructs conduct. Therefore, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes, and thus discards the former to take the latter.

The seven emotions arise from indulgence, and the three poisons stem from greed. Moreover, nature manifests through the heart as its exterior, and the heart manifests nature as its interior. When nature is settled and the mind is clear, with no attachment to external things, then hunting and rare treasures—what harm can they truly bring?

To hunt and chase game is to agitate *qi* and blood, dispersing them outward, and thus the mind becomes maddened. To covet rare treasures is to steal and deceive, to scheme and take crookedly, and thus conduct becomes obstructed. These are the things the sage does not do, and yet he says, “Nourish the belly, not the eyes,” to clarify that he nourishes the inner self and not the outer.

**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**

Honor and humiliation are like sudden shocks; great calamities are like the body itself.

What is meant by honor and humiliation? Honor is lowly—when one gains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called honor and humiliation as sudden shocks.

What is meant by great calamities being like the body? The reason I have great calamities is that I have a body. When the heart is loyal to the Dao yet ensnared by things, it rejoices in glory and is shocked by misfortune, always burdened by gain and loss, and cannot attain the boundless.

Moreover, when a man dwells in honor and receives his stipend, gaining glory for himself, if he resides in it with ostentation and refuses to decline, if he acts arrogantly and transgresses law, if he is haughty and despises the lowly, if he is dazzling and shames the humble—then accumulating gold and horses, is this not the height of honor? What humiliation is there to speak of?

Yet when he loses even a little, he considers it a grievous loss.

The perfected man is not thus: honor does not bring him joy, disgrace does not bring him sorrow. Receiving a stipend of ten thousand *zhong* (bushels), feasting on a square *fang* (hundred feet) of food—I do not possess it. Eating coarse grains and drinking from a gourd, dwelling in a thatched hut and a clay chamber—I do not sorrow. Gaining it is clamorous, losing it is clamorous—how can it truly shock me?

Only those who possess honor know the greatest humiliation—what else could it be but shock?

When I have no body, what calamity can I have?

Thus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure is as if one could entrust the world to the heavens.

Man receives his fate from the formless and takes shape in the formed. Moreover, when form arises from the formed, it combines the borrowed essences of earth, water, wind, and fire, generating the substance of spirit, *qi*, blood, and essence. Dwelling and moving cannot escape the constraints of cold and heat, and action cannot evade the demands of labor. Thus, even in drinking water and eating grains to fill the inner self, and in wearing silk and cloth to defend the outer, there may be excess or deficiency—how can one avoid calamity?

Only when one steals the true essence of yin and yang, and seizes the proper order of creation, when anger and joy depart from the chest, when cold and heat flee to the external, when one discards the borrowed Four Great Elements and has no body, when one reverses the Nine Transformations and returns to the Dao—then I, with this non-being, do not generate, and in emptiness, there is no transformation. What calamity can there be?

The Classic says, *“When I have no body, what calamity can I have?”*—is this not so?

**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**

That which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (level/even),
That which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare),
That which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).

The Dao dwells above the **Tàisù** (Great Purity) with no form, so the colors that color, even with the clarity of **Lílóu** (a mythical seer), have no place to apply their sight.
The Dao dwells within the **Tàixū** (Great Void) with no sound, so the sounds that sound, even with the acuity of **Shī Guāng** (a legendary musician), have no place to focus their hearing.
The Dao exists before the Nameless with no image, so the images that image, even with the strength of **Wū Gé** (a mythical giant), cannot lift its weight.

Thus, *yí* is why it is unseen when viewed,
*xī* is why it is unheard when listened to,
*wēi* is why it is ungraspable when touched—
this is when speaking of the constant.

If one opens the wise eye to perceive true color, then it can be seen when viewed;
If one awakens the subtle ear to hear rare sound, then it can be heard when listened to;
If one applies wondrous force to move great form, then it can be grasped when touched.

The reason the common man cannot is that the five colors blind the eyes, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five affairs obstruct the heart. These three cannot be forced or constrained, and thus they merge into one.

The Dao is nowhere and everywhere—it cannot be named by things, nor can it be represented by images. Yet when it fulfills its use for the world, then all things are without exception the Dao.

Moreover, the Dao in things is one—it cannot be divided. Yet the sage speaks of *yí*, *xī*, and *wēi* as distinct, setting forth the tendencies of sight, hearing, and touch.

「To speak of their differences, in truth there is no such difference—only the merging into one. How could one force or constrain them?

Its upper aspect is not bright, its lower not dim.
It cannot be named when taut, nor does it return when slack—it is beyond all things.
This is called the *state of no-state*, the *image of no-image*—this is called *hūhuǎng*.
Face it, and you see no head; follow it, and you see no tail.
Hold fast to the ancient Dao to govern the present’s existence.
To know the ancient beginning is called *Dao jì* (the Dao’s pattern).

Things that cling to the Yang rise with clarity, those that cling to the Yin sink with obscurity.
Rising with clarity, beings with form hasten toward it;
sinking with obscurity, things with shape flee from it—
thus all under Heaven know the logic of approach and retreat.

But the Dao is not so.
Its *qi* form ascends, yet does not shine as Yang;
its emptiness descends, yet does not obscure as Yin.
Its coming is without haste yet arrives,
how could one face it?
Its going is without speed yet swift,
how could one follow it?

To exhaust its root, one probes the ancient past yet knows no beginning;
to examine its end, one governs the present yet knows no change.
When one applies the mysterious to it,
above, there is brightness to make it luminous—
then light shines upon all things,
below, there is obscurity to make it dim—
then *qi* emerges from the *bó bó* (the hidden, the obscure).
The dimness above can be ascended to face it,
the dimness below can be sealed to turn away from it.
Those who come, I greet with my spirit to meet them in advance,
those who depart, I follow with my virtue to attend them in retreat.
*Hū* and *huǎng*—when *hū*, there is no thing yet things exist;
when *huǎng*, there is no form yet forms appear—
this is not contrary to the classics,
but the subtle and profound words of the Old Master (Laozi) revealed.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtuous Gentleman**

The ancient virtuous gentleman was subtle, mysterious, and profound—
his depths were unsearchable.
The petty man is precise in things, the gentleman is precise in the Dao.
Precise in things, one is enslaved by them—his skill is finite.
Precise in the Dao, one nourishes it—his transformation is boundless.

Thus the ancient virtuous gentleman
hid in the utmost seclusion,
concealed in the unfathomable,
fully expressing his nature without fixed methods,
exhausting its principles without stagnation.
When he spoke, his words aligned with the Dao yet the multitude could not comprehend,
when he acted, his deeds conformed to its logic yet the multitude could not grasp.
So it was that he sought the hidden yet saw alone,
drove the manifest yet moved alone—
circulating through the Six Voids yet harmonizing with Heaven beyond imitation,
responding to all changes yet governing things without obstruction.
Thus his subtle profundity and mysterious harmony
the people deemed unrecognizable—
not because he deliberately wished to remain obscure and distinct,
but because his Dao was deep and they could not perceive it.

**Solemn yet yielding,**
if his bearing is not dignified, there is no awe to be feared;
if his body is not weighty, there is no decorum to be emulated.
How much more so for one who dwells in the profound abode,
who treads the true path,
whose speech is the *fa yán* (lawful speech),
whose actions are the *fa xíng* (lawful conduct)?
How could he be relaxed yet fear things,
or yielding yet be intimidated by them?

Thus **solemn yet yielding** is fitting.
**Clear like ice about to melt,**
nature is originally empty—
it becomes real only through things;
nature is originally serene—
it moves only through things.

Indeed, the reason things are vast is Yang;
the reason they are bound is Yin.
When Yang clears them, they expand freely, contented, and fulfill themselves,
without clinging to things in their gathering or scattering.
When Yin binds them, the non-existent adheres to the existent,
the scattered settles into the solid—
thick forms cannot thin, weak forces cannot magnify—
this is the logic of *having* in things,
not the intent of *non-having* in the Dao.

How can it be compared?
Like water’s nature—
it may descend to the East, flowing through streams to learn the sea,
or ascend to become clouds and rain,
or guide itself as rivers and streams.
Deep its source, long its flow,
and far its influence—
truly self-sufficient!

But when Yin-*qi* congeals into ice,
its source is blocked, its flow obstructed—
and it cannot spread like water in four directions.

This is why the virtuous gentleman’s **clear nature is like ice about to melt**—
seeking to return to its original state.

**Sincere like the uncarved block,**
ornament overpowers substance—substance is destroyed;
flower overpowers fruit—fruit is hidden.
The Dao of the virtuous gentleman
does not display brilliant flowers to obstruct the great essence,
nor does he exalt empty pretensions to conceal his true talents.
He guards the purity of Heaven’s nature while seeking unalloyed virtue,
collects the essence of Heaven’s truth while seeking unfeigned conduct—
dwelling in the thick yet not in the thin,
residing in the whole yet not in the flawed.
This is what the classics call **sincere like the uncarved block**.」

Vast as the valley, its emptiness—
sufficient for all things yet not claiming possession,
deep without a single particle yet not denying existence.
Things come, and they are met without retention;
affairs arise, and they are received without obstruction.
This is the nature’s boundless responsiveness,
unshaken by things—
thus vastness is like the valley.

Muddled as the turbid.
Dull its radiance, it knows to conceal itself in retreat,
blending with the dust, it knows to merge and reach the utmost void,
steadfast in stillness.

When all things stir together, I observe their return.
All things teeming, they must return to their root.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
stillness is called restoring the Mandate.
To go forth and not return—
its going will have an end;
to depart and not return—
its departure will surely wear thin.

Heaven’s spring arises because of birth through emergence;
its autumn comes because of return through restoration.
Birth and emergence constitute the Mandate,
return and restoration constitute nature—
and yet it is said: *Where there is birth, there is nature*—
why must one wait for restoration to see nature?

Birth is movement, movement brings confusion—
nature is never lost within it.
What is meant by "returning to the root is stillness"?
It is returning to one’s nature.
Again, it says: *"Only in stillness does one see nature"*—
yet here it speaks of stillness to restore the Mandate—
why is this?

Because birth brings the Mandate,
the Mandate is always lost with nature’s decline.
Only in stillness does one see nature—
then the Mandate is restored.
This is exhausting nature to reach the Mandate.

Restoring the Mandate is constancy;
knowing constancy is clarity.
Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.
Stillness is the root of nature,
yet it moves at times to respond to things—
not because nature itself moves.
Constancy is the essence of the Dao,
yet it changes with things to respond to time—
not because the Dao itself alters.

The sage, at the moment of retreat and concealment,
does not dwell in things;
in silent repose,
does not respond to time—
thus his nature remains still and unmoved,
his Dao constant and unchanging—
this is restoring the Mandate.

Constancy is stillness without emergence,
thus nature is attained.
Knowing constancy is clarity—
self-revealing through emptiness,
thus the Dao is attained.

If one acts without knowing constancy,
responding to change,
then the loss of nature and violation of the Dao
will lead to ruin—
what else could it be but disaster?
Thus it continues: *"Ignorance of constancy leads to reckless action—disaster."*

Tolerance is public virtue,
public virtue is kingship,
kingship is Heaven,
Heaven is the Dao.

Infinite variations are not uniform,
all movements are not one—
to select them reveals vastness and subtlety with curves,
to divide them reveals high and low with distinctions.
The sage seeks to unify through harmonizing movement,
to equalize through myriad changes—
all through tolerance.
How then is tolerance achieved?
It arises from knowing constancy alone.

Through tolerance alone,
those who encounter it find it broad and without bias,
those who respond find it singular and undivided.
Its balance is unshakable,
its emptiness unfathomable—
thus, from self-tolerance, one reaches great public virtue.

Having attained public virtue,
one can govern all living things,
enact laws for the world—
the myriad affairs, though complex, can be resolved by me,
the four seas, though vast, can be concealed within.
This is nurturing simplicity within while transforming customs.

Now, muddled as the turbid—
how does this differ?
Who can still the turbid with slow clarity?
Who can settle the restless with slow vitality?
Clear water, if disturbed by things,
becomes turbid in its clarity;
the settled, if tempted by things,
will surely move in their stillness.

Turbidity obscures clarity,
yet cannot restore it through stillness—
clarity is lost in turbidity.
Movement disrupts stillness,
yet cannot transform it through vitality—
stillness is endangered by movement.
This is not the way of the virtuous gentleman.

I am otherwise:
stillness as constancy, slow clarity in turbidity—
what harm is there in turbidity?
Movement as change, slow vitality in stillness—
what must be guarded in stillness?

Thus stillness does not lose nature,
movement does not lose the Dao,
and there is no drowning in one extreme.

Those who preserve this Dao
do not desire fullness.
Only because they do not desire fullness
can they avoid decay while remaining new.

Things fail because of their completion,
affairs decay because of their renewal—
thus the cycles of success and failure,
renewal and decay,
are fixed laws,
yet human nature cannot escape them.

But the virtuous gentleman, guarding the Dao,
allows decay to become renewal;
handling affairs,
allows failure to become new success.
Ages pass without decay—
constant renewal;
a lifetime without failure—
thus it is not achieved by other means,
but arises from not desiring fullness.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter on Attaining the Utmost Void**
Attaining the utmost void,
steadfast in stillness,
all things stir together.
Born yet not possessed,
sometimes possessed—
this is the void not yet extreme.
Settled yet unmoving,
sometimes moving—
this is stillness not yet steadfast.

The Dao is above all things,
responding to myriad changes without depletion,
guarding the true unity without exhaustion—
encompassed by the vastness of the cosmos,
no boundary is seen;
aided by the emergence of all living things,
no movement is known.
Empty and reaching the void,
deep and ever serene—
entering it in abundance does not fill it,
exiting it in multitude does not disturb it.
Thus emptiness is attained to its extreme,
stillness is guarded with steadfastness—
and this is why all things stir together.

All things come,
beginning in formlessness,
ending in manifestation.
If the void is not extreme,
those born cannot avoid obstruction;
if stillness is not steadfast,
those returning cannot avoid exhaustion—
yet if I can return to it,
then human cultivation reaches its peak.

Having reached the peak of human cultivation—
what then?
It is only to communicate with Heaven.

When humans reach communion with Heaven,
this is the utmost.
What need have they of things and persons to control them?

Thus it is the Dao.

This *sutra* is why it contains the Lord—
the Lord becomes King,
the King becomes Heaven,
and Heaven returns to the Dao.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**

The Supreme Sage, below knows of his existence;
The next, is praised and honored;
The next, is feared and reviled.

Of old, the Sage’s governance
stored thought in profound silence,
revered himself in the boundless void,
did nothing yet awaited the world’s actions,
spoke not yet responded to the world’s changes.
With spirit he stirred and moved—
then commands issued without known origin,
with body he taught and transformed—
then governance unfolded without known means.
Thus the people were transformed without coercion,
ruled without effort,
responded without prompting,
feared without punishment.
They daily drew upon his virtue,
unaware of virtue’s embrace;
they daily followed his Dao,
unaware of Dao’s path.
Thus they flowed vast and self-sufficient,
radiant and self-satisfied—
this is the governance of the Supreme Sage,
where nature itself is the transformation.
Hence it is said: *below knows of his existence.*

When the Three Sovereigns came after,
institutions were refined,
rewards and punishments were established.
There was governance that loved people
as a guardian cherishes an infant,
and virtue that returned the people
like water flowing to its source.
With kindness they nurtured them,
and the people loved them as parents;
with benevolence they relieved them,
and the people praised them as Heaven and Earth.
This was the age of deliberate action,
where governance ruled the people—
thus the people honored and praised them.

But the next was otherwise.
Some established harsh laws and severe punishments
to wield terror from above,
others inverted the Dao and ruined virtue
and lost governance below.
One feared their threats yet dared transgressions
to escape shame,
the other scorned their governance
and disrupted norms to commit wrongs.
Thus laws, though feared, bred defiance,
virtue, though scorned, could not prevent it.
The people fell short of praise and honor,
and the Sage above was ashamed of those who merely knew of him.
How could one not choose wisely?

If trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.
Thus, value your words.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
the people say, *"It was natural."*
Within, it aligns with oneself;
without, it deceives not the world—
this is called trust.
Trust is what the Sage uses
to proclaim commands and intentions,
reaching to the four quarters.
If lacking in this, how shall the people trust?

The Sage first contemplates, then speaks;
first deliberates, then acts.
His words are not reckless,
his speech not deceitful.
His commands are like divination—
trustworthy and verifiable.
His orders are like echoes—
responsive and certain.
Thus trust is established.

But if trust is lacking,
its root lies in undervaluing words.
Words, when valued, are not lightly spoken;
words, when valued, are not cheaply given.
Not lightly spoken, they carry weight—
no words are spoken in haste.
Not cheaply given, they are honored—
no words are spoken in vain.
Only thus do deeds reach fulfillment,
affairs reach completion,
and the people act naturally.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**

When the Great Dao is abandoned,
ren and yi arise;
When wisdom emerges,
great deceit follows.

The Sage, when facing affairs, has no intent;
when encountering things, has no mind.
No intent—then the labor of governance and restraint
does not manifest externally.
No mind—then the scheming of calculation and perception
does not arise within.
Thus all actions stem from the Dao,
all speech and silence align with the Dao.

Yet when myriad threads arise,
a hundred forms emerge,
love and hatred take shape,
and the authority of taking and withholding is established—
then the Great Dao splits into two,
and ren and yi are put into practice.

When knowledge grows excessive,
the Sage guards with simplicity.
When schemes arise from foresight,
the Sage employs obscurity.
Knowledge, if not restrained, will be deficient—
then wisdom becomes rigid.
Perception, if not obscured, will be unclear—
then schemes become cunning.
Thus wisdom arises from the chest,
and great deceit from the heart—
and the Dao is distant from us.

**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**

Discard the Sage, abandon wisdom—
the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.
To know all is called the Sage,
to know everything is called wisdom.
The Sage, then, fulfills nature to realize the self,
embodies the Dao to govern things—
yet specifically discards this,
daring not to claim sagacity,
for it is beyond what the common people can attain.
Wisdom, then, reveals the past to foresee the unseen,
discerns the present to know the unchanging—
yet specifically abandons this,
daring not to claim knowledge,
for it is beyond what the common people understand.

If one claims sagacity,
those who fall short feign it with deceit.
If one claims wisdom,
those who lack it abandon truth for falsehood.
Only by discarding and abandoning them
do the people return to their natural inclinations—
and their benefit increases a hundredfold.

Discard ren, abandon yi—
the people return to filial piety and kindness.
Heaven has five decrees,
humans have five constants—
then parent and child are Heaven’s natural order.
At the beginning of Heaven’s decree,
innate knowledge arises from nature,
innate ability stems from no deliberation—
and the essence of filial piety and kindness
naturally resides between parent and child.
What need is there for teaching to guide them?

Yet when parent and child grow estranged,
it is because ren and yi obstruct them.
Ren is love for others,
yet when applied where love is absent,
yi is propriety for others,
yet when applied where it is unsuited—
then things contend in love where love is lacking,
and people uphold propriety where it is misplaced.
Filial piety and kindness may thus be lost.

If ren and yi are discarded,
the people return to filial piety and kindness.

Discard cleverness, abandon gain—
then thieves and robbers will cease.
To value cleverness is to exhaust it,
to value gain is to contend for it—
the roots of thieves and robbers.
Embrace simplicity, hold to purity,
reduce private desires, minimize cravings.
Those who follow the current flow far
will inevitably dry up,
those who cling to branches multiply
yet will inevitably falter.
Now, if one abandons the current to seek the source,
the source will surely clarify;
if one discards the branches to return to the root,
the root will surely endure.

Thus, the three things are abandoned—
yet what now remains?
It must be to realize one’s true nature alone,
and so one sees simplicity, embraces purity,
reduces private desires, and minimizes cravings,
that these may follow in turn.

*"Seeing simplicity"* means no defilement to stain its essence,
*"embracing purity"* means no ornament to disrupt its root.
Fewer private concerns mean no confusion to cling to things,
fewer desires mean no theft or excess to lose oneself—
how then could these not be the removal of what disturbs the true nature?

**Daoist Classic Commentary (Middle Scroll) – Anonymous**

**Chapter Twenty: "Ceasing Learning Brings No Worries"**

Ceasing learning brings no worries.
Learning aims to exhaust the principles of things (理),
but the principles of things are inexhaustible—
thus one cannot fully realize one’s nature (性).
If one cannot fully realize one’s nature,
then confusion and delusion arise,
and worries and joys come uninvited.

Now, when we say "ceasing learning,"
it means learning has reached the point of exhausting principles,
and one’s nature is attained.

When nature is attained,
no joy is greater than this—
this is why there is no worry.

How far apart are *wu* (無) and *a* (阿)?
How different are *shan* (善) and *evil* (惡)?

In abiding by the Dao/Way’s truth (真),
there is no distinction from falsehood (伪).
In attaining nature’s virtue/power (善),
there is no separation from evil (惡).

If truth is lost,
falsehood arises in its place.
If virtue/power is compromised,
evil emerges from it.
Thus, the distance between truth and falsehood,
and virtue/power and evil,
is indeed not far—
it is discerned by those who embody the Dao/Way.

What people fear,
one must fear.

The Sage withdraws to seclusion,
conceals himself in stillness,
wanders leisurely and at ease,
rejoicing in the purity of Heaven’s nature (天真).
He is unobstructed and harmonious,
upright and pure,
to grasp the reins of Heaven’s sovereign power (天宰).
He is enlightened and penetrating in his understanding,
yet does not entangle himself in distinctions of things.
He stands above the world,
yet does not clash with all affairs.
This is to abide by one’s own Dao/Way
and not conform to things.

But when he conforms to the common ways,
harmonizes without differing from the crowd,
speaks and mingles with things,
his actions align with the people’s afflictions—
then worries of good fortune and calamity cannot be avoided.
This is what people fear,
and why it cannot be ignored.

The common folk bustle and rejoice,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,
as if ascending the Spring Terrace.
They see the Dao/Way yet do not recognize it,
follow the Dao/Way yet do not understand it.
The six emotions (六情) overwhelm their spiritual depths (靈渊),
the five thieves (五賊) disrupt their true sovereignty (真宰).
This is the way of the common folk.

They do not know the loss of their nature (性),
pursue emotions for delight,
indulge in things for joy,
bustle to gratify their desires,
and cling to appearances, following the world’s shifting moods—
thus they deem their joy as grand as feasting on the grandest offerings
or ascending the Spring Terrace.

Feasting on the grandest offerings is deemed beautiful,
ascending the Spring Terrace is deemed honorable—
these two joys,
can the common folk truly attain them?
Only the truly joyful can.

I alone stand in dread,
as yet unmanifest,
like an infant before its first smile.
The common folk are bright and clear,
I alone seem dim and obscured;
the common folk are sharp and discerning,
I alone am muddled and dull.

The Dao disperses from its pure transformation into the *wei* (維), while the loss of nature arises from harmony and suitability, manifesting as discord. When one exhales brilliance outward, substance is necessarily depleted within; when one shifts truth to external things, essence is inevitably consumed. Sometimes cunning arises from great falsehood, and deceit emerges from many paths—then my Dao is lost to them.

But I differ from this. I contain harmony while my thoughts do not yet sprout, guard the One while my purity does not scatter. I forget joy and anger to block my passions, assail love and aversion to dissolve their intent. Like the unmanifest before its form, like an infant before its first smile—who else could fully embody nature and the Dao?

Only by fully embodying nature does one always remain deficient,
Only by embodying the Dao does one always remain weak.
To be deficient for the sake of the world’s completeness,
To be weak for the sake of the world’s strength—
This is why I always differ from the common folk.
Thus, where they are bright and clear,
I seem dim and obscured;
where they are sharp and discerning,
I am muddled and dull.

Mellow as the sea, yet unresting like a whirlwind.
I dwell in emptiness and stillness to govern myself,
I wait in depth and profundity to respond to things—
This is the embodiment of the Dao, hence my mellowness like the sea.
I universally nourish the world,
I am vast and scatter across all things—
This is the application of the Dao, hence my whirlwind without end.

The common folk all have their ways,
I alone am stubborn and coarse.
My Dao is theirs is matter—
Matter without the Dao does not arise,
The Dao without matter is eternal.
I dwell in the Dao’s constancy—
How could matter affect me?
Thus I make matter serve my purpose,
For I am not enslaved by it.

Yet the common folk all have their ways,
I alone am stubborn and coarse—
Is it because I cannot enter or take?
I alone differ from others,
Yet I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.
Speaking of its beginning, it is like the unmanifest before its form;
Speaking of its eminence, it is like the Emperor before his emergence.
The heavens and earth are vast,
With the Dao as their origin;
All things are many,
With the Dao as their Mother.
The Mother has the way of giving birth and nourishing—
I have long dwelled here, gazing—
Do I not desire to be born?
Do I not desire to be nourished?
Having been born and nourished,
What else could I abandon the Dao for?
Thus, I value nourishing at the Mother’s breast.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue Follows the Dao**
The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao cannot be learned—
It is followed by nature and spontaneity,
And those who follow nature naturally attain the Dao.
When the Dao is attained by me,
Then what I nourish is true,
What I bestow is virtue,
And virtue thus arises from the Dao,
Emerging after me so that others may cultivate it.

Yet the Dao is without form,
While virtue is with form.
When virtue reaches its peak, it merges into the Dao;
When the Dao is supreme, it disperses into virtue.
Thus, the interplay of Dao and virtue
Has never been separable.
The Classic speaks of the manifestation of great virtue,
Following only the Dao—
Its principle is as such.

The Dao, as a thing,
Is only vague and indistinct.
Indistinct and vague, yet within it are forms;
Vague and indistinct, yet within it are things.
Profound and dark, yet within it is essence—
Its essence is most true,
Within it is authenticity.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has never faded,
To observe all things.

How do I know all things are thus?
Because of this:
When the Dao reaches supreme stillness, it cannot be heard;
When the Dao reaches supreme nothingness, it cannot be seen.
To move forward and meet it, there is no head to face;
To follow behind and track it, there is no tail to pursue—
This is the essence of the Great Dao,
Dwelling in its constancy.

When it departs from its essence to manifest in application,
It cannot be said to be without form while lacking a name,
Cannot be said to be without substance while lacking appearance—
This is the "having within the without,"
And thus forms emerge from the indistinct and vague.

This is its essence—
Called true nothingness;
This is its application—
Called true having.
When there are forms, there are things;
When there are shapes, there is nature.
After forms and things arise,
To speak of essence is to speak of true having—
True having is not the source of generation,
But it enters the realm of transformation,
Dwelling in the domain of yin and yang.
When true nature is stirred, it transforms without transformation;
When authentic *qi* circulates, it generates without generation—
This is generation,
Its principle is profound.
Not manifesting in visible forms,
Not revealing in clear shapes—
It is truly true,
Truly authentic,
And always employs profundity and darkness in its function.
Only those who grasp the Dao,
The insight of the perfected,
Can discuss this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Bending to Fulfil**
Bend to be whole,
Crooked to be straight,
Hollow to be full,
Worn to be renewed,
Few to gain,
Many to be confused.
The Dao disperses across the world—
Those who grasp it subtly attain refinement,
Those who grasp it sparsely attain coarseness.
Thus, the world’s people and things cannot help but differ in their distance, duration, elevation, and depth.

The Sage possesses the Dao in its completeness,
Receives nature in its entirety,
And in responding to the world’s diversity,
Achieves the boundless within oneself—
All without relying on external means,
But following its inherent principle.

Moreover, the world’s natures cannot all be straight—
If I insist on my straightness to correct others’ crookedness,
My straightness cannot avoid harm.
The world’s things cannot all be beautiful—
If I rely on my fullness without accommodating others,
My fullness cannot avoid loss.
Things replace one another,
Necessarily reaching a point of wear—
If I embrace renewal, then wear will come at its time;
Matters intermingle,
Necessarily bringing confusion—
If I survey broadly, then confusion will arise at its time.

The Sage knows this,
Following the principles of things—
Thus, bending makes straight,
Lowering makes full,
Renewing virtue daily while always embracing wear,
Guarding with restraint to avoid confusion—
Only then, internally dwelling in the Dao,
Is the Dao never incomplete;
Externally governing affairs,
Is governance never disordered.
With my subtlety awaiting the world’s multitude,
With my proximity drawing the far reaches of the four seas.

**The Way of Self-Effacement and Virtue**

If not by emptiness in dwelling upon oneself,
And by expansiveness in treating others,
Then how could one achieve such harmony?

Thus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under heaven.
*Oneness* is the beginning of the Dao,
The origin of heaven and earth.
Before yin and yang were distinct,
My true essence was without falsehood,
And when all things had not yet emerged,
My nature was without division.

Others and I cannot both be served by duality,
Humans and things cannot be separated by mutual distinctions—
This is the transformation of the utmost purity,
The complete Dao of pristine essence.
Extending this to all under heaven,
How could it not be the ultimate law?

Not self-assertive, thus clear;
Not self-righteous, thus victorious;
Not self-conceited, thus enduring.

Only by not contending,
The world cannot contend with me.
The ancients spoke of *"bending to preserve fullness"*—
Was this not a truth spoken sincerely?
It is indeed fullness that returns to its source.

The world’s clarity shines in seeing others,
Yet fails to see itself—
No greater clarity exists,
For without true clarity, one cannot see oneself,
Nor dare one claim to see others.

The world’s wisdom knows of others,
Yet fails to know itself—
No greater wisdom exists,
For without true wisdom, one cannot affirm itself,
Nor dare one affirm others.

Thus, when virtue extends to all under heaven,
Its blessings are never excluded—
When it transcends all people,
None can surpass its vastness.
If not the Sage,
How could its clarity not be self-assertive,
Unable to bend and preserve fullness?
How could its wisdom not be self-righteous,
Unable to yield and attain straightness?

To boast of one’s achievements until fullness overflows,
Reaching the point of false pretension—
Then what of humility?
To vaunt one’s abilities until brilliance fades,
Reaching the point of self-exhaustion—
Then what of renewal?

Such is the way of the common multitude,
But the Sage reverses this—
Hence, again he says:
*"Only by not contending,
The world cannot contend with me."*

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Rare and Natural**

The rare and natural—
That which has form can be deduced by principle,
That which has speech can be guided by things.
Some matters arise from human action,
Others emerge from the unfolding of time—
These are not the true rare and natural.

Only that which cannot be forced yet comes to be,
Which cannot be summoned yet arrives,
Which is perceived by the spirit and then seen,
Which is heard by the *qi* and then understood—
If one receives without exclusion,
Then transformation comes without prompting;
If one gives rise to what already exists,
Then change emerges from what is present—
Then what is there to do?

It is simply being in accord with nature.
This is why none can force it yet it is done,
None can transform it yet it is transformed—
If not the rare and natural, what else could it be?

Yet the unrefined cannot achieve this,
And yet it is called rare—
Because to raise one corner is not to reflect the other three.

A gusting wind does not last all morning,
A sudden rain does not last all day.
Of all that heaven uses to stir life,
Nothing is greater than the wind,
And of all that nourishes things,
Nothing is greater than the rain.
Wind and rain are heaven’s resources,
The reliance of all things—
Yet they arise only when yin and yang meet in harmony.

The true essence of yin and yang
Is upright yet without contradiction,
Harmonious yet without discord—
Thus they arrive without fail,
Their coming is measured,
Their course is constant.
Then where is the difference between gusting and sudden?

Only when they exceed their bounds,
Do they become gusting wind or sudden rain—
This is the irregularity of yin and yang,
And why they do not last all morning or all day.

Thus, those who follow the Dao:
The Daoist aligns with the Dao,
The virtuous align with virtue,
The lost align with loss.
To align with the Dao, the Dao is attained;
To align with virtue, virtue is attained—
To align with loss, loss is attained.

To dwell in the realm of the formless,
To be still in the midst of nothingness—
Not to seek the Dao through names and instruments,
Not to grasp it through forms and images—
Yet to remain ever in the profound transformations of the *mystic-mystic*,
In the depths of the *obscure-obscure*—
Without seeking the Dao, the Dao is found,
Without seeking virtue, virtue is found.

Only when one departs from the formless to cling to the formed,
When one abandons Oneness to pursue duality,
When one seeks the Dao’s name to claim attainment,
When one seeks virtue’s splendor to claim attainment—
Then, if attained, it is truly loss.

To seek the Dao without aligning with virtue,
To have virtue without knowing loss—
This is to dwell in the true boundary of the formless,
In the wondrous realm of the *mystic-mystic*—
And to act without ever departing from the rare.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Stilted Cannot Stand**

The stilted cannot stand,
The straddling cannot walk.
Humans must have nature,
Things must have boundaries—
If nature is imbalanced,
The Dao cannot be fully preserved;
If boundaries are exceeded,
The Dao cannot be sought in its fullness.

Thus, the Dao arises from nature,
Nature enters through the Dao—
To return the body to the nameless,
To embody transformation in the natural,
One must first await the purity and stillness of nature.

If one desires to stand yet remains stilted,
If one desires to walk yet straddles—
To reverse and stand stilted,
To reverse and walk straddling,
One must know that it cannot be done.

An incomplete form struggles even in standing and walking,
How much more so an imbalanced nature
That could ever establish the Dao?

---

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Origin**

There is an undifferentiated origin,
Born before heaven and earth—
Silent and vast,
It stands alone yet never changes,
It moves in cycles yet never falters—
Shimmering above yet vast without form,
Obscure within yet indistinct without image—
Yin and yang concealed in a single hue,
Creation and transformation hidden in the unfathomable—
Then clarity and turbidity are not yet divided,
Heaven and earth are not yet distinct—
And yet, how could one call it *undifferentiated*?

When heaven and earth are born
And all things emerge,
Then my Dao disperses and becomes distinct throughout the world,
To fulfill its function.

Now, to speak of the undifferentiated origin—
It is the ancient Master’s desire to gather the world’s scattered fragments
And return them to Oneness,
To complete the ten thousand things without end,
To move in cycles without depletion,
And to ensure the ages without flaw—
Hence he says:
*"It stands alone yet never changes,
It moves in cycles yet never falters."*

To stand alone yet never change,
This is how the Dao undifferentiated remains above to return to its source—
To move in cycles yet never falter,
This is how the Dao undifferentiated flows below to embrace transformation—
Then the principle of the undifferentiated origin
Is revealed in these two aspects.

「Thus, the Dao can be the mother of the world.
I do not know its true name, so I call it *Dao*,
and forcefully name it *Great*.
Great it passes, passing it goes far,
far it returns.

In the past, the singular *qi* filled the four directions without bound,
and permeated the six voids without end.
It covered the heavens above yet no one knew its limits,
it filled the earth below yet no one knew its depths—
how could this be?

The Sage, after distinguishing the heavens and earth,
at the beginning of all things,
endowed it with the name *Dao* and forcefully called it *Great*—
thus, the name of *Great Dao* is what the Sage forcefully bestowed,
not because its essence is thereby established.

Only because it is *Great*, it traverses the world’s functions,
reaching everywhere, exhausting all things of the four seas.
To reach everywhere is called *passing*;
to exhaust all things is called *far*.
When the Dao reaches *far*, then evil scatters and distances itself from the root,
thus it returns to restore the beginning,
and ensures that the end becomes the start in eternal cycles—
this is why *far* is called *returning*.

Hence, the Dao is great, the heavens are great, the earth is great,
and the ruler is also great.
Within the realm there are four great things,
and the ruler occupies one of them.

Humans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens,
the heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *Ziran* [自然].
The heavens and earth possess the utmost sovereign,
yet the Dao surpasses them all;
all things have their formed principles,
yet the Dao is their deepest mystery—
thus, the Dao, encompassing the universe to its utmost extremes,
dwelling above the Three Realms [三才],
is great beyond measure.

From singularity to duality, the Two Polarities [两仪] take their positions:
the one above, exalted and boundless in its far-reaching,
the one below, profound and vast without end—
who could surpass their nurturing and encompassing function?
Its greatness thus attains the Dao’s singularity.

With the Two Polarities established, the Sage stands in the middle,
possessing utmost sovereignty to govern all things,
and utmost fairness to uphold the Great Dao,
fulfilling the ranks of humanity,
and embodying the ruler’s Way—
how could this be considered small?

This is why the ruler is also great.

To elaborate and clarify,
the greatness of the Dao is the heavens,
the greatness of the heavens is the earth,
the greatness of the earth is the ruler—
thus, it follows below with: *"Humans follow the earth,
the earth follows the heavens,
the heavens follow the Dao."*
Yet the Dao itself follows none—
it arises from *Ziran* alone,
hence: *"The Dao follows Ziran."*

**Chapter XXVI: On Weight as the Root of Lightness**
Weight is the root of lightness,
stillness is the sovereign of agitation.
Thus, the virtuous person walks all day without straying from his baggage.
Though surrounded by splendor and spectacle,
he rests in detached serenity.
How could one of the ten thousand chariots
consider his own body as weightier than the world?

The principles of heaven and earth,
the sentiments of all things—
when steadfast, they are weighty;
weighty, they return to their source.
When tranquil, they are still;
still, they restore their true nature.

Yet when entangled in the world’s myriad principles,
variation arises from it;
when embroiled in all things’ diverse sentiments,
stratagems emerge from it.
Variation arises, and myriad forms come together,
while weighty things are burdened by lightness;
stratagems emerge, and falsehoods intermingle,
while still things are disturbed by agitation.
The affliction of frivolity and superficiality sometimes manifests,
and omens of good and ill, regret and blame,
reach everywhere.

In the past, weight was lost to its source,
and stillness in its time was disrupted by agitation—
thus, it was not good.

The virtuous person knows that weight is the root of lightness,
so he walks without straying from his baggage;
knows that stillness is the sovereign of agitation,
so though surrounded by splendor and spectacle,
he rests in detached serenity.
Thus, the virtuous person’s understanding of weight, lightness, agitation, and stillness
also returns to the source and restores true nature.

Lightness leads to losing one’s subjects,
agitation leads to losing one’s sovereignty.
A ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven,
possessing wealth of the four seas,
his power is the utmost sovereign,
his station the utmost height—
his weight is indeed unexcelled.
If he opposes the world with his own body,
if he regards the world as the multitude,
and his own body as weighty,
then with the sovereignty of the ten thousand chariots,
his own body should be considered light.
Yet this is not good.

**Chapter XXVII: On Benevolent Action**
Benevolent action leaves no tracks or traces,
yet with chariots he traverses all lands,
and on foot he ascends every path—
his actions, though vast, are thus benevolent.

The Sage embodies the spirit in the most profound depths,
conceals the marvelous in the unfathomable.
In stillness, he dwells with the Dao,
in motion, he emerges with the Dao—
when he acts, how could there be tracks or traces to observe?
It is simply without.

Tracks imply stagnation in movement,
traces imply obstruction in passage.
The Sage’s actions are without stagnation yet ever in motion,
without obstruction yet ever in passage—
though enduring to the ten thousand ages,
what flaw could there be?
This is because he is wholly dedicated to the Dao.

Benevolent speech is without blemish or censure,
The Sage dwells in the Dao within himself,
and employs the Dao to benefit all things.
When dwelling within himself,
he is silent and exchanges with the spirit,
dark and unites with the mind—
radiant within the marvelous transformation,
quiet within the mysterious creation—
why would speech be preferred over this?

Yet when he emerges to benefit all things,
engaging in deeds and stirring the heart’s voice,
he proclaims a single word to make the world his law,
and spreads a single teaching to set the ten thousand ages as his standard.
He dispels the dullness of the common people,
and awakens the deafness of the world—
thus, his speech arises from necessity.

Yet even his speech,
does not multiply to excess nor deplete by scarcity—
when much, it exhausts all principles,
filling the world yet never wrong;
when little, it adheres to the law,
not reaching even a single scroll yet still right—
this is benevolent speech,
how could it not be without blemish or censure?

To invert this with unbenevolent speech,
emerging to invite blame,
moving to regret,
recklessly creating flaws,
and cleverly harming virtue—
it is not merely without blemish or censure,
but also brings harm.

**On Benevolent Planning Without Calculation**
Exhausting the realm’s transformations,
its variations are endless;
comprehending the world’s numbers,
its reckoning is boundless.
Exhausting one’s intelligence leads to fatigue,
expending one’s strength leads to depletion—
though one may wish to calculate,
it cannot be measured.»

The Sage acts otherwise—
holding fast to the One to govern myriad changes,
calculating for oneself as for all things.
Outside the One, there are no numbers;
when numbers reach me, they are all summed in the One.
Outside the self, there are no things;
when things come to me, I respond with the self.
Thus, myriad changes return to the One,
myriad things are embodied in the self—
the world’s numbers are known without descending from the hall,
so why bother with reckoning rods?
If not for Benevolent Planning,
it would be impossible.

Benevolent closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.
Emerging to meet the world,
using the Dao as its function,
drawing forth those who cannot yet,
receiving those who have not yet arrived—
then the path must be clearly revealed,
the words plainly established,
opening my way so people may ascend with ease,
clearing my gate so they may enter with haste.
But when withdrawing to conceal in secrecy,
speech does not mingle with affairs,
the body does not touch with things—
quietly abiding, the spirit cannot be glimpsed at its edge,
darkly guarding, none know its place.
Blocked by no path, sealed by no gate,
cut off from the external yet firm within,
emerging from things and entering the Dao—
no drawing forth, so the unready have nothing to await,
no receiving, so the unarrived have nothing to reach.
Though no bolts or bars guard the gate,
none can open and enter—
this is called Benevolent closure.

Benevolent binding requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.
Common trust may falter with time,
so it must be bound with restraint.
The Sage’s trust is vast—
with my own trust binding the world’s trust,
to demonstrate to future ages,
to descend unendingly,
and make the myriad people rely on a single word—
how could it be undone?
Thus, the Sage always excels in saving people,
so none are abandoned;
always excels in saving things,
so none are discarded.
The Sage embodies the Dao—
the Dao has no people or things,
sharing the desire for life,
united in aversion to death.
If even one is abandoned,
where would people and things find sustenance?
Thus, the Sage always excels in saving people and things.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,
the unvirtuous are the resources of the virtuous.
Not valuing one’s teacher,
not cherishing one’s resources—
though wise, one is greatly confused—
this is called the supreme subtlety.
When people depart from their nature,
the division between virtue and unvirtue arises.
Using virtue to save unvirtue—
this is how one becomes a teacher.
Leveraging unvirtue to manifest virtue—
this is how one becomes a resource.
If spoken in terms of the Dao,
the teacher is not to be valued,
the resource is not to be cherished.
Valuing the teacher creates *self*,
cherishing the resource creates *other*—
when *self* and *other* both exist,
the heart of distinction arises,
and this is a harm to the Dao—
yet again, not Benevolent.
Only through wisdom as confusion
is this called the supreme subtlety.

How so? With knowledge, perception is revealed externally,
thoughts are stored within,
and discernment is bent by things—
then true essence is sometimes obscured.
Instead, as if in confusion,
arising from ignorance,
not displaying externally in forms,
internally awakening to emptiness—
this is the Dao’s supreme subtlety.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**
Knowing the Heroic, guarding the Receptive,
becomes the valley of the world.
As the valley of the world,
constant virtue does not depart,
returning to the infant.
Taking the Yang as Heroic,
the Yin as Receptive—
Yang is inclined to action,
Yin to stillness—
thus knowing the Heroic is to know action,
the Receptive is to know stillness.
The Perfect One abides in emptiness within,
extends generosity to others,
does not rely on possession to lead,
constantly dwells in humility and self-effacement,
receives from things without feeling full,
penetrates understanding without claiming it as *self*,
embodies natural transformation without departing from innate purity,
returns to the essence of the Great Primordial without mixing with uncarved truth—
thus, none do not guard the Receptive,
taking stillness as the valley and fulfilling nature,
until constant virtue does not depart,
like the infant.
The infant—
taking in true essence without expelling it externally,
guarding the One without scattering into multiplicity.
If one knows the Heroic and favors action without guarding it with the Receptive,
altering nature toward substance without attaining emptiness—
how could one become like the infant?

Knowing the Bright, guarding the Dark,
becomes the model of the world.
As the model of the world,
constant virtue does not err,
returning to the Boundless.
Brightness is yet to receive the five colors,
so its staining depends on time—
this is the beginning of color.
The Perfect One guards against this,
so as to guard the Dark.
The Dark—
once colors are formed, they cannot change.
Yet though unchangeable,
in direction it is the North,
in season it is Winter.
When direction reaches the North,
East and South arise from here;
when season reaches Winter,
Spring and Summer emerge from here—
thus, beginnings arise here,
and endings complete here—
its force is boundless,
its transformation vast and thorough—
thus, the Perfect One guards it.
Only by guarding this
do things transform and complete,
affairs reach their limits and change,
the myriad people take it as model,
the world embodies it as law—
its virtue thus reaches the Boundless.
If not for guarding the Dark,
how could one attain this?

Knowing Honor, guarding Humiliation,
becomes the valley of the world.
As the valley of the world,
constant virtue is sufficient,
returning to the Uncarved.
The Dao is never openly displayed in brilliance,
nature is always directed toward filth and obscurity—
when the Dao is displayed and bright,
concerns cannot retreat to seclusion,
when nature is filthy and obscure,
excess and waste become dangers.
Thus, vastness bends itself in humility,
emptiness responds to others—
knowing honor as the root of harm to the Dao,
I reject it;
knowing humiliation as the foundation of perfecting nature,
I embrace it—
responding to their coming without depleting my abundance,
supplying their departure without exhausting my emptiness—
rich with surplus, content with sufficiency,
then pure and constantly returning to the Great Uncarved.
This perfection of nature—
divine and bright.
The Uncarved disperses to become vessels,
the Sage uses it to become officials and leaders.

The Way is that which is beyond form—
returning to the Uncarved in its origin.

Form is that which is beneath—
the time when the Uncarved disperses into vessels.

Thus, the Great Measure does not cut.

The Way is governed by Nature—
how could there be carving or severing?

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: On Those Who Would Take the World by Force**
Those who would seize the world and act upon it—
I see their necessity as unavoidable.

Of old, the sovereigns of the world
dwelt in ease and leisure within the rocky and boundless,
deep in silence and stillness, yet at peace upon their mats,
governing by the Way so that the people knew not their actions,
working by spirit so that none observed their deeds—
this was the age of Non-Action,
not something to be seized.

If one acts and only then achieves,
if one does and only then completes,
if one commands and only then obeys,
if one punishes those who do not obey,
if one rewards only after labor is done,
if one punishes only after failure,
if one waits to attack those who do not court,
if one waits to execute those who do not transform—
then such governance cannot be joyous,
only endured when there is no alternative.

The world is a divine vessel—
it cannot be acted upon.
To act upon it is to ruin it;
to grasp it is to lose it.

Thus things move or follow,
breathe in or exhale,
strengthen or weaken,
rise or fall.
If one regards the world as having substance,
then myriad flaws arise daily,
thousandfold changes cluster,
things become enemies to action,
affairs become calamities to governance—
then one’s heart grows weary, one’s thoughts labor,
seeking governance yet never attaining it.

Only when one forgets the world within,
when internally there is no self,
when externally there are no things—
when there is no self, then transformations unfold unseen,
when there are no things, then the Way and virtue manifest beyond knowing.
The arts of ritual and music for governing the people—
I shall use them to cultivate my own self.
The laws and measures for governance—
I shall use them to discipline myself.
When myriad forms contend, I do not seek them;
when affairs and things come, I do not grasp them—
this is the principle that the world’s divine vessel cannot be acted upon.

If one acts, one ruins it;
if one grasps, one loses it—
all because one competes with things.
Things have their own movement and following,
and they are never aligned—
when one moves ahead, the following must lag behind.
Things have their own inhaling and exhaling,
and they are never unified—
when one breathes to warm, the exhaling has already arrived.
If strength and weakness succeed one another,
if rise and fall alternate—
these are the inevitable consequences of having substance.
To contend with force, to scheme with intelligence,
to argue with clarity, to scrutinize with acuteness—
even the Sage would find it exhausting.
How could I bear such strain?

Thus, the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids excessiveness.
Things have their proper measure,
affairs have their constants.
To exceed one’s measure is excess—
excess without harm is the greatest harm.
To overstep constants is extravagance—
extravagance without restraint is the greatest distress.
Excessiveness arises from these two—
it cannot aid the Sage, hence it is rejected.

**Chapter Thirty: On Assisting the Sovereign with the Way**
To assist the sovereign with the Way
is not to strengthen the world with arms—
its effects return naturally.

The Way has its essence,
the Way has its function.
When dwelling in its essence,
it is vast and does not respond to affairs,
it is serene and does not follow the world—
thus, to dwell in the Way and find joy.

When the Way is applied,
it engages in action and responds to affairs—
then in virtue it is virtue,
in governance it is governance,
in teaching it is teaching,
in transformation it is transformation—
even to refining laws and establishing new codes,
all are matters of assisting the sovereign with the Way.

Only by assisting the sovereign with the Way
does one serve people with virtue,
teach the people with righteousness—
those who do not court you return with their own benevolence,
those who do not transform return with their own governance—
why then would one strengthen the world with arms?

Thus, those who return are like water flowing to its source,
those who come are like children yearning for their father—
how could there be any fault in their return?
Hence it is said: *its effects return naturally.*

Where the teacher dwells, thorns grow.
After great armies, there are years of famine.
Thus, the virtuous act only when necessary,
never daring to seize strength.

Act decisively yet without arrogance,
act decisively yet without boasting,
act decisively yet without pride—
to act only when necessary is to act without seizing.

The ancient Sages used arms
only to supplement virtue,
not for joy in action,
only when there was no alternative.

Thus, the Yellow Emperor had the battle of Chiyou,
King Wen had the campaign against the Rong—
all sought not to delight in war
but to achieve victory over others,
ultimately to perfect governance.

If one boasts of martial prowess,
if one brags of military strength,
if one grows proud of battlefield triumphs—
then one clearly delights in war,
and such will be seen as tyranny,
contrary to the principle of acting without seizing.

To act decisively is to seek governance,
not to seize victory—
this is to know that where the teacher dwells,
the land’s *qi* is injured,
and after great armies, Heaven loses its harmony,
thus there are years of famine.

If Heaven and Earth are thus harmed,
how could the use of arms not also cause loss?
This is the Sage’s warning.

When things are at their peak, they grow old—
this is called *not* the Way,
and the Way perishes early.

To know the masculine and guard the feminine,
to know the masculine as movement—
from this, fortune and misfortune arise—
thus, to guard stillness is to remain constantly at ease.

To know the white and guard the black,
to regard black as the north—
thus, returning to the beginning,
there is no end.

These two speak of the Way’s movement and stillness,
its beginning and end.

Before distinctions arise,
the True does not mingle with things,
transformation does not shift with emotions—
not allowing rise and decline to interfere with governance,
not allowing vigor and decay to steal one’s merit—
eternally unspent, forever without end—
why burden oneself with such concerns?

Moreover, when things reach their peak, they grow old—
this is not the Way.
Since it is not the Way,
it should perish early.

**Chapter 31: The Virtuous Warrior**

The virtuous warrior—
a weapon of ill omen,
which men detest.
Thus, the Daoist does not dwell upon it.

Therefore, the noble man at home values the left,
in war, values the right.
A weapon is an ill-omened tool,
not the tool of the noble.
When used, it must be done with solemn restraint—
this is the highest virtue.

To triumph without delighting in it—
yet to delight in it is to rejoice in killing.
He who rejoices in killing
cannot prevail under Heaven.

Auspicious matters favor the left,
inauspicious matters favor the right.
The Left General takes the left,
the Supreme General takes the right—
this is to treat the high position as a funeral rite.
When many are slain, weep with sorrow—
victory is treated as a funeral rite.

To slaughter *qi* and harm harmony,
to wage war without virtue—
though ten thousand are vanquished,
a thousand of ours are lost.
How much worse if we fail yet suffer no harm?
Thus, it is rightly called an ill-omened tool—
and the Daoist does not dwell upon it.

The Daoist, embracing *Oneness* above,
settles the people within.
To guard *Oneness* with *wuwei* is to follow nature—
thus, at ease and wandering,
ever aligned with the Way.
To govern the people through institutions is to manifest law—
thus, adapting and transforming,
ever approaching the Way.

Though war is ill-omened,
the Daoist does not delight in it.
If forced to use it,
let restraint be supreme.
Why flaunt our might to cow their courage,
or march our armies to suppress their chaos?
Do not revel in killing,
but let victory serve the Way.
Draw all benefits to the True Source,
and with three reversals, plan for triumph—
this is not to boast of beauty.
If one boasts of beauty,
then he delights in killing—
how can he be called Daoist?

**Chapter 32: The Way’s Nameless Perfection**

The Way is ever nameless.
Though simple, it is unmatched under Heaven.
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would come as guests.

True yet undivided,
pure yet unadorned—
unmixed in its purity,
unbroken in its completeness—
this is called *Pu* (the Uncarved Block).

The Way’s *Pu* ever returns to the Nameless,
the Way’s *Pu* ever returns to the Formless.
Nameless—it may be grasped in a word,
Formless—it may be sought in a thought—
thus, it is called small.

Yet when it emerges to respond to Heaven’s transformations,
when it disperses to fulfill all forms—
those with *xing* (nature) are born of *xing*,
those with form are transformed by form.
From this, Heaven begins,
and all things take their mother.
Vastly dwelling before the Imperial Form,
standing above the most refined—
who then could subdue it?

If kings and lords guard this *Pu*,
all things will come as guests.
Within the central realm, four great forces exist—
the Way and the King each occupy one.
If the King wields this *Pu* to govern all things,
then under Heaven, far and wide,
the good will come without urging,
the wicked will depart without punishment—
until even those with eyes strain to see,
and those with feet rise to hasten.
Those transformed by its influence have no outer limit,
those who receive its virtue have a place to return.
Small and great gather in clouds,
near and far follow as shadows—
is this not to be served as guests?

In speaking of the Way, none can subdue it—
this is called the most exalted.
In speaking of all things, they come as guests—
this is called the most honored.
Most exalted, most honored—
the Way cannot be sought in forms and tools,
thus it is called *Pu*.

Seek it, and you find it;
abandon it, and you lose it.
It comes when sought,
departs when abandoned—
how could it not be small?
This small is not merely small—
it is small yet vast,
thus none can subdue it,
and all things come as guests.

Heaven and Earth unite,
and sweet dew descends.
No one commands it,
yet it is evenly bestowed.

The Great Way is hidden in yin and yang,
yin and yang are hidden in the Great Way.
Heaven and Earth are the Way’s yin and yang,
thus yang descends below,
yin ascends above—
their *qi* merging,
forming sweet dew.

Moreover, at the Way’s beginning,
it split and gave birth to One—
in the Five Phases, it is water;
in man, it is life.
Thus, Heaven and Earth have the principle of generation.

That which gives life must also complete it—
thus, sweet dew’s transformation is through *qi*,
*qi*’s transformation is through form—
and nothing fails to be born.
Without the harmony of yin and yang to fulfill its purpose,
none can speak of it.

When naming first arose,
names already existed.
Know when to stop—
knowing when to stop is to avoid peril.

The Way lies beyond things,
its *Pu* is nameless.
*Pu* disperses within things,
becoming forms and tools—
and names arise from this.

Names bring reality,
reality brings measure,
measure brings cycles of renewal and decay,
of formation and ruin—
thus, it departs from *Pu*.

If one does not know when to stop,
pursuing names exhaustively,
observing forms to establish many theories,
wearing out spirit and mind without satisfaction,
exhausting thought and labor under burdens of care—
is this not perilous?

Knowing when to stop is to avoid peril.

The Way in the world
is like rivers and valleys to the sea.
At birth, all men share the Way,
possessing its nature.
Day by day, month by month,
time will shift them.

Having gathered nature through the Way,
the people’s return is but a restoration to their root—
what harm could there be in not following?

This is like rivers and valleys to the sea—
they do not await summons before they come.

**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**

**Chapter 34: The Great Dao is Universal**

The affairs of the world cluster thickly yet are difficult to distinguish;
if one does not know how to discern them,
the false may pass for the true.

The things of the world blend indistinguishably yet are hard to tell apart;
if one does not know how to discern them,
the similar may be taken as the same.

When it comes to bending myriad emotions to return to the proper,
observing myriad changes to suit what is fitting—
the foolish dare not claim to be wise,
while the wise, though not overlooked, may still have regrets.
If not for knowing others,
how could one achieve such?

Is this not what we call *wisdom*?

Wisdom lies in knowing others,
but one’s own right and wrong may still be insufficient to perceive,
one’s own virtues and vices may still be insufficient to discern.
When one must act,
it is not enough to simply *take* what should be *taken* or *discard* what should be *discarded*.
Even so, though wise, one is not yet *enlightened*.

As for *enlightenment*,
one perceives one’s own right and wrong,
not confusing wrong for right,
discerns one’s own virtues and vices,
not clinging to vice as virtue.
Every word spoken must accord with human sentiment,
every deed done must align with the will of the multitude.
Within, there is no bending to please or flatter,
without, no factionalism to seek praise—
this is the *self-knowing* one,
far surpassing mere *knowing of others*,
hence called *enlightenment*.

The victorious over others have *strength*,
but the self-victorious are *powerful*.
Mengqin compared to an infant,
the rhinoceros-tiger compared to a wasp or scorpion—
what is their victory worth?
It comes merely from *strength*.

Thus, to bully the weak with the strong,
to oppress the few with the many,
is not truly remarkable.

But if one conquers one’s own private interests,
discards one’s own desires,
and gains enough to harm oneself or enough to invite self-reproach—
this is the *self-victorious*,
transcending mere victory over others,
hence called *powerful*.

The contented are *wealthy*.
If one’s nature strays from its proper measure,
then greed knows no end.
If the Dao fills one’s self,
then one’s desires are satisfied.

Thus, the perfect sage does not yield to the fame of profit and desire,
nor is he entangled in the realm of superficial splendor.
External things cannot lure his true heart,
empty praise cannot sway his noble resolve.
He nourishes himself with the true,
fills himself with the Dao,
and remains ever-satisfied within—
this is *wealth*,
and this is greatness.

The resolute in action have *will*.
A *Pegasus* leaps a single stride,
a *clod-horse* ten strides.
If a *Pegasus* were to travel a thousand *li*,
it would not be called *willful*—
only the *clod-horse*, with its strong and unyielding force,
pushing forward step by step without pause,
and thus able to reach its destination—
this is what we call *will*.

The enduring last long in their place.
The true does not yield to external forces,
nature does not shift with circumstance—
thus, one attains one’s proper place.
Attaining one’s place,
one rejoices in what is naturally held,
finds peace in what is spontaneous—
this is how one endures.

The one who dies yet does not perish is *long-lived*.
Those who die must have once lived,
those who live must one day die—
since birth, all men and things
have never been free from these two fates.

Only by preserving the true spirit within,
by safeguarding the true nature at its core,
does one not cling to things—
for things cannot then alter one’s self.
Nor does one scatter outward—
for externals cannot then lure one’s self.

Though the form may rot,
my true essence remains whole in stillness.
Though fame may fade,
my nature abides in the distant.
Though traces may vanish,
my spirit ever watches.
Though words may cease,
my *qi* ever speaks—
this is the one who dies yet does not perish,
whose life is great.

The Great Dao is universal,
neither leaning left nor right.
It revolves through motion and stillness,
dwelling nowhere it does not.
It flows universally, fitting all curves,
and nowhere it cannot go.

Take from the left, and the right is not hindered;
take from the right, and the left is not neglected.
The small is not deemed insignificant,
the great is not feared.
The void is not seen as lacking,
the full is not seen as overabundant—
all this is the Great Dao,
is it not universal?

The myriad things rely on it to be born,
yet it does not refuse them.
It accomplishes its work,
yet does not dwell upon it.
It clothes and covers all things,
yet does not claim lordship over them.

Before the two *principles* were distinguished,
the Dao was pure and uncarved above—
simple and unadorned—
who could be the *Heaven* and *Earth*?
Who could be the myriad things?
None could know.

Once the two *principles* were divided,
*yin* and *yang* split apart,
their transformations spread through the four seasons,
their growth and completion through the myriad things—
then the Dao was dispersed.

Yet, the past was not deemed *nonexistent*,
the present is not deemed *existing*.
The former was not deemed *great*,
the latter is not deemed *small*.
Thus, all things are born through it,
yet it does not refuse—
its birth is endless.
Its work is accomplished for all,
yet it does not dwell—
its work is without end.

All things gain it and live,
lose it and die.
Flowering and fruiting,
turning toward or away,
gathering or scattering—
none escape this,
is it not the *master*?

Yet it does not claim lordship—
for it is hidden in the minutest blades of grass,
not deemed *nonexistent*,
and it permeates all transformations,
not deemed *existing*.

It has no desires,
yet may be called *small*.
All things return to it,
yet it knows no lordship—
thus may it be called *great*.

The Dao is without desires,
yet the perfect sage, with no desires to ponder,
attains it—
hence called *small*.

The Dao is without bounds,
filling all space without limit,
no thing can escape it—
hence called *great*.

*Small* stops at *no desire*,
but with desire, one responds to all things endlessly—
this is not *small*.
*Great* stops at *knowing no lordship*,
but knowing lordship sets one in opposition to things,
leading to fixed boundaries—
this is not *great*.

Only in its *no desire* and *knowing no lordship*
can the Dao’s *small* and *great* be named.

Thus, the sage can achieve true *greatness*—
for it is by not claiming self as great
that he attains true *greatness*.

The sage enters and dwells with the Dao,
exits and walks with the Dao.
His subtlety is aligned with the Dao’s Way,
his emptiness with the Dao’s substance—
thus, the sage and the Dao are one.
Hence, he achieves true *greatness* without claiming self as great,
and thus is truly *great*.

**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**
Grasping the Great Symbol,
the world comes to it.

The sage abides in lowliness,
using the Dao to govern himself.
In motion, his bearing responds,
yet nothing exceeds the Dao.

The sage ascends to high station,
emerging to attend the emperor’s affairs,
displaying his role as a sovereign’s teacher.
With presence spanning the Four Seas,
he guides the distant and the near,
bringing them to harmony.
Daily surveying myriad matters,
he cultivates virtue among the people—
is this not wielding the Great Dao to rule the world?

Now, what is called the *Great Symbol*:
it is the Dao’s application in governing the people.

If I grasp nothing,
then the tools of governance and instruction may falter,
the implements of law and order may be seized,
and the people of the world would have no reliance—
how could they come?

Only by grasping this Great Symbol
do I hold what I possess,
clutch what I control—
all matters of governing the people,
I bear them in my hands.
Why would the world not come?

Speaking of the *Symbol*, it is precious to hold fast—
thus, we speak of the *Great Symbol*, not the *Great Dao*.

**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Welcoming and Withdrawing**

When one seeks to withdraw it,
one must first firmly extend it;
when one seeks to weaken it,
one must first firmly strengthen it;
when one seeks to ruin it,
one must first firmly promote it;
when one seeks to take it away,
one must first firmly give it.

This is called *subtle clarity*.

Heaven and Earth have their constant principles,
yin and yang their proper nature—
the interplay of cold and heat,
the succession of flourishing and decline among all things,
until they reach their end and begin anew,
exhaustion and rebirth—
this is the natural, knowable order.

Thus, the interplay of withdrawal and extension,
weakness and strength,
ruin and promotion,
taking and giving—
the withdrawn precedes the extended,
the weak follows the strong,
ruin precedes flourishing,
taking follows giving,
and all must come in turn—
this is what the common world observes.

The sage abides in the Dao,
transcending Heaven and Earth’s constants,
adjusting yin and yang’s proper nature,
penetrating hidden truths,
suspended beyond measure.
Swift and slow appear where none can know,
delay and haste arise from what is unseen.
To welcome it, he appears first—
yet suddenly it is behind;
to follow it, he appears last—
yet suddenly it is ahead.
When it departs, it returns;
when it perishes, it revives—
ghosts and gods cannot spy its traces,
yin and yang cannot encompass its subtlety.
Thus, the sage’s Dao
fully exhausts its transformations.

This withdrawal and extension,
weakening and strengthening,
ruining and promoting,
taking and giving—
are without fixed principles to constrain it.
This is what is called *subtle yet clear*.

The *subtle* perceives the hidden and discerns what is coming,
knows the early signs and sees what is first,
penetrates the nature of things,
illuminates hidden truths—
and has the means to explore what is yet unformed.

The soft overcomes the hard,
the weak overcomes the strong.

In its emptiness, the Dao
receives the world’s utmost transformations;
in its formlessness, it
withstands the world’s utmost power.

Though its simplicity is small,
none in the world can subdue it.
All things return to it,
yet it does not claim them as its own—
this is the Dao’s softness and weakness—
who can overcome it?

Those who serve the Dao
how could they not humble themselves,
harmonize and weaken,
not be full yet await their own?
Always modest, deferring to others—
having virtue yet not possessing it,
having ability yet not relying on it,
not contending yet the world regards them first,
not boasting yet the world regards them capable—
this is the softness and weakness of serving the Dao,
also unconquerable.

Yet to reverse it:
the great bends to the small,
the high is humbled by the low,
seeking to be hard and strong,
to overcome the soft and weak—
this is truly not knowing the Dao.

The fish cannot be taken from its depths,
nor can the state’s sharpest tools be openly displayed to the people.

The fish, as a creature,
dwells hidden in the profound and boundless,
concealing its form to preserve its life,
yet when exposed to light, misfortune comes.

The Sage embodies the Dao to govern the world,
preserves the spirit to transform the people,
reveals subtle and manifest principles
to meet the needs of the times,
shows the first signs of change
as the threads of action,
flux and transformation move beyond all naming,
benefits and uses are concealed beyond all measure.
The people daily shift toward goodness,
unaware of how it comes to pass,
the world daily ascends to order,
unseeing its source.
This is why sharp tools are not displayed to the people,
and thus such harmony is achieved.

Were the mechanisms exposed to the times,
words proclaimed to the people,
and the methods of law and governance revealed,
this would not be the way of sharp tools.
The Sage holds it in shame.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven of the Dao/Way’s Constant Non-Action**
The Dao/Way is ever without action yet accomplishes all.
If lords and kings could guard it,
all things would transform of their own accord.

Its essence is emptiness and stillness,
its application is flux and adaptability.
Its essence, emptiness and stillness,
gathers all to the silent void,
collects the great tranquility within vastness,
then swift or slow responses arise naturally,
without contrivance or effort.
Its application, flux and adaptability,
reaches across the world without fixed course,
aligns with all transformations without rigid stance,
moves and turns with grace—
depart from this, and discord follows;
responds to all with fitting measure—
lack this, and chaos ensues.
Even to the most vast or minute,
long or short, high or low,
crooked or straight—
none escape its guiding course.
This is the Dao’s *without failing to act*.

Without action, it responds to all transformations above,
operates within the six directions below—
truly, it acts.
Without failing to act, it stirs with the spirit unseen,
moves without trace,
acts without display—
thus, it achieves perfect non-action.
This is the Dao’s principle of *non-action yet without failing to act*.

If lords and kings guard this to govern the world,
no words need be spoken yet commands resound across the seas,
no movements occur yet teachings shine forth—
this is the Dao’s *without action yet without failing to act*,
unless they embody the Dao, how could it be?

To transform yet to contrive,
I would steady it with the nameless simplicity.
The nameless simplicity,
also, would not desire to contrive.
Without desire, stillness reigns,
and the world would self-correct.

Human nature begins with the balance of impulses,
holds the purity of its origin,
the pristine essence preserved within,
the vital source intact—
this is the time of *embracing simplicity*.
Yet as passions are pursued, the essence scatters,
as external influences take hold, the spirit perishes,
as indulgence in desires meets false ends,
as delight in superficiality forsakes the root—
this is to stray from nature, lose simplicity.

If there were a means to save it,
it would revert—
yet once the world’s transformation is complete,
its order long established,
the people would grow weary.
Beginning with naturalness,
ending with contrivance,
pure yet yielding to flaws,
harmonious yet conforming to deceit—
the world’s ways would shift accordingly,
how could they revert?

Unless steadied by the nameless simplicity,
the true nature would restore itself.
Yet the Sage embraces simplicity
only to govern himself,
not to save others.

When the world’s contrivance begins,
passions and deceits have already taken root,
changes and distortions have emerged,
the pristine essence fades,
the great simplicity decays—
then to steady it,
how could this be my wish?

Better to remain still and correct oneself
than to seek correction in others.
The great Dao originates with the nameless,
as the beginning of heaven and earth.
Yet when the nameless simplicity is used
to suppress the world’s desires,
the Dao reaches its end.
This is why the *Supreme Sage* composed the *Dao/Way Classic*,
and this is its final teaching.

**Commentary on the *True Classic of Dao and Virtue/Power* (解卷下)**
By an anonymous author.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Virtue/Power of the Supreme Virtue/Power**

The Supreme Virtue/Power does not act in virtue/power,
And thus has virtue/power.
The lesser virtue/power clings to virtue/power,
And thus lacks virtue/power.

The Supreme Virtue/Power acts without contrivance,
Yet achieves nothing.
The lesser virtue/power acts with contrivance,
Yet achieves something.

The Supreme Benevolence acts without contrivance,
Yet achieves nothing.
The Supreme Righteousness acts with contrivance,
Yet achieves something.

The Supreme Rites act with contrivance,
Yet none respond—
Then they bare their arms and force compliance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue/power arises;
When virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, rites arise.

For rites are the thinnest of loyalty and trust,
Yet the beginning of chaos.
Preemptive foresight is the adornment of the Dao,
Yet the start of folly.

Thus, the noble one dwells in the thick, not the thin,
In the substance, not the adornment—
Therefore, he discards the latter and takes the former.

The Supreme Virtue/Power is the Virtue/Power of Heaven.
The Sage observes Heaven,
Silently aligning with the Dao,
Finding nothing to grasp—
Thus, it is said, he does not act in virtue/power.
Because he grasps nothing,
Virtue/power naturally returns to him—
Thus, he has virtue/power.

The lesser virtue/power is the virtue/power of grasping.
The lesser virtue/power clings to virtue/power,
And thus is called "not losing virtue/power."
But those who cling do not embody the Dao and virtue/power—
Thus, they lack virtue/power.

The Virtue/Power of Heaven is beyond attainment,
So it acts without contrivance and achieves nothing.
The virtue/power of grasping clings to its attainment,
So it acts with contrivance and achieves something.

When virtue/power descends to benevolence,
Benevolence can be wielded—
Thus, the Supreme Virtue/Power acts without contrivance,
While Supreme Benevolence acts with contrivance.
Yet great benevolence is not benevolence—
Though it acts, it achieves nothing,
And nearly approaches the Supreme Virtue/Power.

Righteousness encompasses virtue/power,
Yet righteousness can be diminished—
Thus, the lesser virtue/power acts with contrivance,
And even Supreme Righteousness does so.
Yet inwardly, it establishes the self without forgetting it,
Outwardly, it governs affairs without abandoning them—
Though called Supreme Righteousness, it still clings,
Thus achieving something and resembling the lesser virtue/power.

When the Dao declines and virtue/power wanes,
Transformation and righteousness are both lost—
Using rites to interact with others,
This is the exchange of sincerity for pretense,
And thus, action breeds calamity.
When none respond, they bare their arms and force compliance—
From this, one can see what is lost,
And each descent is clear—
Thus, it is said:
When the Dao is lost, virtue/power arises;
When virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, rites arise.

When Supreme Rites act and none respond,
This is the thinning of loyalty and trust.
Baring arms and forcing compliance—
This is the beginning of chaos.

Yet virtue/power encompasses both high and low,
While from benevolence downward,
Only the high is spoken of—
Thus, the low is already unworthy of mention.
As for preemptive foresight as foresight,
Its higher aspects are not even mentioned—
This is even more beneath rites.

Exhausting thought and straining deliberation,
Sharpening and refining—
Thus, it is called the adornment of the Dao.
Wearying the mind and laboring the spirit,
Losing one’s true nature—
Thus, it is called the start of folly.

Since it is not said that rites follow wisdom,
It is because those who rely on rites disrupt virtue/power,
And those who rely on wisdom invert the Dao.

Thus, the noble one dwells in the thick of virtue/power,
Not in the thinness of rites,
In the substance of the Dao,
Not in the adornment of wisdom—
Therefore, he discards the adornments of human conduct
And takes the substance of the Dao of Transformation.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Chapter of the Ancient Attainment of Oneness**

In ancient times, those who attained Oneness:
Heaven attained Oneness and became clear,
Earth attained Oneness and became tranquil,
The spirit attained Oneness and became responsive,
The valleys attained Oneness and became full,
All things attained Oneness and flourished,
And the sovereigns attained Oneness to govern the world aright.

Their attainment of Oneness was such:
If Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear cracking,
If Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear erupting,
If the spirit lacked responsiveness, it would fear fading,
If the valleys lacked fullness, they would fear drying up,
If all things lacked flourishing, they would fear extinction,
If the sovereigns lacked right governance, their noble status would fear collapse.

Thus, the noble relies on the lowly as its foundation,
And the high relies on the lowly as its base.
Therefore, sovereigns call themselves "lonely," "widowed," and "not-grain"—
Is this not relying on the lowly as foundation?
Is it not so?

Thus, the carriage of ten thousand horses is not adorned,
Not polished like jade, nor rugged like stone.
Oneness is the Dao.

Before form, there was nothing attained—
When the undifferentiated became distinct,
It originated from ancient times,
And thus things obtained it.

Heaven, firm and vast above,
Uses non-action as its function,
Thus attaining the Dao and becoming clear.
Earth, settled and vast below,
Uses stillness as its essence,
Thus attaining the Dao and becoming tranquil.
The spirit, hidden and profound in the depths,
Unfathomable in yin and yang,
Thus attaining the Dao and becoming responsive.
The valleys, hollow and sunken,
Follow the Dao of Heaven—
Since Heaven attains the Dao and becomes clear,
The valleys attain the Dao and become full.
Things, still and nurtured,
Follow the Dao of Earth—
Since Earth attains the Dao and becomes tranquil,
Things attain the Dao and flourish.
The spirit dwells in the body,
The sovereign of all limbs—
The spirit, the sovereign of all saints,
The sovereign of the world—
Since the spirit attains the Dao and becomes responsive,
The sovereign attains the Dao to govern the world aright.

This attainment is none other than the Dao.

If Heaven loses its clarity,
It would have nothing to cover—
And would fear cracking.
If Earth loses its tranquility,
It would have nothing to bear—
And would fear erupting.
If the spirit loses its responsiveness,
It would have nothing to guard—
And would fear fading.
If the valleys lose their fullness,
They would fear drying up.
If all things lose their flourishing,
They would fear extinction.
If the sovereigns lose their right governance,
Their noble status would fear collapse.

Thus, the lowly returns to them, displaying their nobility,
The lowly adheres to them, displaying their height—
Just as mountains accumulate the low to become high,
And seas gather waters to become vast,
Great persons unite to become sovereigns—
Thus, the noble and high cannot abandon their fundamental base.

Therefore, the sovereign attains Oneness within his domain,
And thus calls himself "lonely" and "widowed,"
Feeding on the qi of Great Harmony,
And thus calls himself "not-grain."
With a hundred limbs,
Only then is the body’s sovereign noble—

The noble is honored only when the people exist—
Thus, the sovereigns attain their exalted titles through this,
Is it not because they take the lowly as their foundation?

Now, the making of a carriage is but an analogy drawn near.
If one were to assemble the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes before you,
And count their many parts,
Yet constrain their use,
They would still not suffice to form a carriage.
Only when the yoke, axles, wheels, and spokes are united
Does the carriage earn its name of conveyance;
Only when the people, low and humble, are gathered
Do the sovereigns attain their titles of nobility and height.

Jade is noble, stone is lowly—
Jade, emerging from stone, becomes noble,
For it takes the lowly as its foundation.
Yet jade has inherent substance and thus is noble by itself,
While the sovereign, though possessing Oneness,
Does not inherently become noble—
Could he truly wish to be like jade and stone?

**Chapter Forty: The Motion of the Dao in Reversal**
The motion of the Dao lies in reversal,
Its use lies in weakness.
All things under heaven are born of *having*,
And *having* is born of *non-having*.

Stillness is the way of Earth.
To reverse Earth’s stillness into motion
Is the response of yin to yang—
Thus, it is said: *The motion of the Dao lies in reversal.*

Weakness is the way of Heaven.
To employ Heaven’s weakness as use
Is the response of yang to yin—
Thus, it is said: *The use of the Dao lies in weakness.*

Yang employs *non-having* as its use,
Yin employs *having* as its substance.
When yin and yang interact within the boundless void,
Then things are born.

All things under heaven are born of Earth’s way,
Thus, it is said: *All things are born of having*—
This is the motion of the Dao in reversal?
Yet what is formed cannot suffice for life without Heaven’s way,
Thus, it is said: *Having is born of non-having*—
This is the use of the Dao in weakness.

Therefore, the Sage speaks:
*Having* takes *non-having* as its mother,
*Non-having* takes *emptiness* as its mother,
*Emptiness* takes the Dao as its mother.
Naturalness is the root of the Dao.
If one can preserve and guard the Mysterious Pivot,
And follow its naturalness,
Then, from motion returning to stillness,
And gathering use back into substance,
One will return to the Dao.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**
The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;
The mediocre person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly, as if it might vanish;
The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Thus, the *Building of Speech* says:
The Dao is bright yet seems obscure,
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat,
The Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged,
Virtue’s height is like a valley,
Great whiteness seems like shame,
Broad virtue seems insufficient,
Established virtue seems lazy,
Authentic truth seems false,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel takes longest to shape,
The greatest sound is faint,
The greatest form is shapeless,
The Dao is hidden and nameless.

Only the Dao is good at lending itself to completion.
The superior person, having already understood the Dao,
Thus holds it with sincerity and guards it firmly—
When they hear it, they must act upon it with vigor.
The mediocre person, striving to advance in the Dao,
Makes effort and only then succeeds—
Without effort, they fail.
They ponder and only then attain it—
Without pondering, they do not.
One moment they advance, the next they retreat—
Even when they hear it, doubt lingers in their hearts,
Thus, between existence and nonexistence,
They do not yet act upon it.
The inferior person takes the Dao’s path as level,
Like one with coarse ears who does not hear great sounds,
Like one with a common mind who rejects lofty speech—
When they hear the Dao, they scorn it with derision,
Thus, they oppose the Dao utterly and laugh at it.
If the Dao were not laughed at by the inferior,
How different would it be from what coarse ears hear,
From what the multitude speaks?
How could it suffice to be called the Dao?

Thus, the *Building of Speech* says:
The Dao is bright yet seems obscure—
If one stores it diligently in thought,
Fixes it in stillness, and reflects in silence,
And strives in its practice,
Then one attains it.
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat—
If one calculates it daily and finds it insufficient,
Yet calculates it yearly and finds it in excess,
And in existence and nonexistence bears no burden,
Then it is acceptable.
The Dao’s path is smooth yet seems rugged—
If one clings to the attainable forms, colors, names, and sounds,
And the pleasures of ear, eye, nose, and mouth,
Then when people laugh at the Dao, one has erred.
Yet do they not know that the Four Great Elements exist within the domain,
Yet are not external to the Dao?

The highest virtue is the way of Heaven.
Heaven’s way is hollow yet full—
Because it is hollow, it is like a valley.
Great whiteness is the way of the King.
The King’s way is worn yet renewed—
Because it is worn, it is like shame.
Broad virtue, spoken of in terms of Earth’s way,
Is used without depletion,
Yet its completion seems lacking—
Thus, it seems insufficient.
Established virtue, spoken of in terms of the Great Dao,
Is built without being uprooted,
Yet its cultivation is unnoticed—
Thus, it seems lazy.
Because it is like a valley, like shame, like insufficiency, like laziness,
One might doubt its changing nature.
Yet its essence as highest virtue, as great whiteness, as broad virtue, as established virtue
Remains eternally true—
This is called *authentic truth seeming false.*

Why is authentic truth said to seem false?
Because the greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel takes longest to shape,
The greatest sound is faint,
The greatest form is shapeless.
The greatest square carries all things,
Its virtue harmonizes without force—
Thus, it has no corners.
The greatest vessel is used for its purpose,
Enduring in its way—
Thus, it takes long to complete.
The greatest sound is unsounded,
Yet the four seasons move through it—
Thus, its voice is faint.
The greatest form is not a thing,
Yet all under heaven turn toward it—
Thus, it is shapeless.
These are the reasons the Four Great are great.

Virtue encompasses the Dao,
The Dao encompasses Heaven,
The Emperor’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth’s ways,
And is nameless—
For it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao is present yet hidden,
As if dividing the Four Great within the domain,
All are but its manifesting and forcing of names.
The Dao itself is not good at lending itself to completion,
Yet because Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor embody this Dao to complete the world,
The name of *good at lending itself to completion* is thus established,
And the effect of its curved fulfillment is thus marked.
Yet its completion is merely so—
Could there be intent in urging it to completion?

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Birth to Oneness**
The Dao gives birth to Oneness,
Oneness gives birth to the Two,
The Two gives birth to the Three,
The Three gives birth to all things.
All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,
And through their harmonizing *qi* achieve balance.

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Dao of the Sovereign and the Sovereign’s Teachings**
What men detest—*nao* (孤), *gua* (寡), and *bu gu* (不谷)—the kings and lords take as their titles.
Thus, things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.
What men are taught, I too teach with righteousness.
The strong and violent shall not meet their proper end.
I shall take this as my guiding principle.

The *Easy* (易) transforms and becomes Oneness,
For this is how Oneness arises—
Thus it is said: *The Dao gives birth to Oneness.*
Oneness is the beginning of form’s transformation,
The greatest form of Heaven and Earth—
Thus it is said: *Oneness gives birth to the Two.*
Heaven and Earth establish their positions,
Man dwells between them, and the Three Powers are complete—
Thus it is said: *The Two give birth to the Three.*
The light and pure ascend to become Heaven,
The heavy and turbid descend to become Earth,
The harmonizing *qi* becomes Man—
Then Heaven and Earth contain their essence,
And all things transform and are born—
Thus it is said: *The Three give birth to all things.*
Heaven is yang, austere and solemn;
What issues from Heaven, yin ascends to meet yang,
And things bear it upon their backs.
Earth is yin, resplendent and vast;
What issues from Earth, yang descends to meet yin,
And things embrace it within.
As yin and yang rise and fall,
Their interplay gives birth to the harmonizing *qi*—
Thus it is said: *All things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang,*
*And through their harmonizing qi achieve balance.*

A man’s body mirrors Heaven and Earth:
Within him, yin and yang and harmonizing *qi* are all present.
There must be a most divine principle governing him,
Just as kings and lords govern the world.
To be solitary within this domain is *nao* (孤);
To feed upon the *Taihe* (太和) *qi* is *bu gu* (不谷).
Men of the world turn from the divine, calling these evils,
Yet the kings and lords embrace them as their titles—
Thus it is said: *What men detest—nao, gua, and bu gu—the kings and lords take as their titles.*

The harmonizing *qi* of yin and yang permeates all things,
Yet by itself, it neither diminishes nor benefits.
It is through Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,
Their waxing and waning with time,
That things may be diminished to gain, or gained to diminish.
What men are taught must align with Heaven and Earth’s rectitude.
If I cherish stillness, the people will naturally align—
This is my righteous teaching.
This is called *diminishing to gain*.
The strong and violent invert this—
Thus they do not meet their proper end.
This is called *gaining to diminish*.
The sage observes this and takes it as a warning,
Thus I shall take this as my guiding principle.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness of the World**
The world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.
Nothing can penetrate the seamless—
Thus one knows the benefit of *wuwei* (无为).
Silent teaching and the benefit of *wuwei*—
Few in the world attain them.

Supreme softness is *shen* (神);
Supreme hardness is *xing* (形).
True *shen* communicates with the Dao,
Capable of annihilation and existence—
Only by letting *shen* govern *xing* can *shen* make *xing* soar,
And *xing* follow to roam at will—
Thus it is said: *The world’s supreme softness overcomes the world’s supreme hardness.*
Supreme softness is without form,
Supreme hardness is seamless—
If *xing* governs *xing*, there are gaps;
Thus the seamless cannot be penetrated.
If *shen* governs *xing*, *shen* has passage—
Nothing enters without finding its place—
Thus it is said: *Nothing can penetrate the seamless.*

What *xing* transforms is silent teaching.
What *shen* attains is the benefit of *wuwei*.
If one embodies the Dao of Heaven and Earth,
Dwells in *wuwei*, and practices silent teaching,
Then one shapes *xing* and harmonizes with *shen*—
*Xing* and *shen* both reach perfection,
And align with the true Dao.

The world values spoken teaching and active doing,
Thus few attain this.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Names and the Body**
Between names and the body, which is more intimate?
Between the body and wealth, which is more abundant?
Between gain and loss, which brings greater harm?
Thus, excessive love leads to great expenditure,
And hoarding leads to great loss.
Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,
Knowing restraint brings no peril—
Thus one may endure forever.

The noble man labors night and day in anxious deliberation,
Yet his body grows frail—
Thus he perishes for the sake of his name.
Who sees what is truly intimate—the body or the name?

The wealthy man toils endlessly, amassing wealth he cannot fully use,
Yet his body grows estranged—
Thus he perishes for the sake of profit.
Who sees what is truly abundant—the body or wealth?

Yet when honor and disgrace are established, one sees what truly harms;
When wealth accumulates, one sees what is truly contested.
Those who value display as right know that names bring honor,
Those who value riches as right know that wealth brings profit—
Thus they see gain and forget the body,
See profit and forget the true self.

Then, between gain and loss, which truly brings greater harm?
What they lose is the nameless *pu* (朴),
The body unburdened by wealth—
What greater harm could there be?

Thus, to love names excessively without restraint
Will exhaust the greatest things—
The greatest things are the Dao’s designation,
The nameless *pu* itself.
To hoard wealth without knowing sufficiency
Will deplete the deepest virtues—
The deepest virtues are the essence of *de* (德),
The body unburdened by wealth.

Only the sage embodies broad virtue in knowing sufficiency,
Yet does not prize his wealth—
Thus he does not bring disgrace upon himself.
He embodies supreme virtue in knowing restraint,
Yet does not exalt his name—
Thus he does not court peril.

Such a one may endure forever,
And stand equal with Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**
Great fullness seems as if deficient—
Its use is inexhaustible.
Great abundance seems as if empty—
Its use is boundless.
Great truth seems as if bent,
Great skill seems as if clumsy,
Great eloquence seems as if inarticulate.

Agitation overcomes cold,
Stillness overcomes heat—
Calmness and purity are the world’s rectitude.

Great fullness is Earth’s virtue—
Broad virtue seems insufficient,
Thus though complete, it seems deficient.
Great abundance is Heaven’s virtue—
Supreme virtue does not indulge itself,
Thus though full, it seems empty.

If completion is like a mountain, it will inevitably crumble—
This is not great fullness.
Great fullness, though deficient, never crumbles—
Thus its use is inexhaustible.

**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**
When fullness is like accumulated water,
Its application will inevitably be exhausted—
This is not great abundance.
Great abundance seems as if empty,
Yet never exhausted—
Thus its use is boundless.

These two principles are the functions of Heaven and Earth—
Yin and Yang, they are.
Heaven can generate without ceasing,
Yet its generative use is boundless.
Earth can transform without ceasing,
Yet its transformative use is inexhaustible—
This is because the Way acts truly within them.

Only the unified is called the Three,
Thus, when Heaven and Earth are considered,
The Way becomes known.
If divided, then:
Great straightness seems bent—
This is the Way of Earth.
Earth’s Way is straight yet restrained,
Thus it seems clumsy.

Great skill seems clumsy—
This is the Constant Way.
The Constant Way carves myriad forms yet does not indulge in cleverness,
Thus it seems clumsy.

Great eloquence seems inarticulate—
This is the Way of Heaven.
Heaven’s Way does not speak yet responds perfectly,
Thus it seems mute.

Yet considering their essence,
Though Heaven and Earth are vast,
They do not depart from Yin and Yang,
And one Yin, one Yang—
This is the Way.
Thus, accumulated Yang is Heaven,
Accumulated Yin is Earth.
Yin is still, Yang is agitated,
Yang is hot, Yin is cold.
That which governs Yin is Yang,
Thus agitation overcomes cold.
That which governs Yang is Yin,
Thus stillness overcomes heat.

Yet when cold departs, heat arrives,
And when heat departs, cold returns—
How could their use ever be exhausted or depleted?

The Way has clarity and turbidity,
Movement and stillness.
Clarity is the source of turbidity,
Stillness is the foundation of movement.
If one can always maintain clarity and stillness,
Then Heaven and Earth will all return to it—
What then of things?
What then of affairs?

Thus it is said:
Clarity and purity are the rectitude of the world.

**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony with the Way**
When the world is in harmony with the Way,
Even warhorses are turned to manure.
When the world lacks the Way,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No blame is greater than coveting acquisition.
Thus, the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.

One who governs the world with the Way
Always keeps the people without knowledge or desire,
So each person rests content in their place without contention,
And merely tends their fields.
But in the declining ages,
When the Way cannot be revived,
Then they see what is desirable yet do not know sufficiency.
Thus arises the heart of coveting acquisition,
And they begin to plunder, usurp, and trample boundaries,
While warhorses breed in the suburbs.

Reflecting upon oneself,
Within one’s own world lies the self.
If the Way is applied to the self,
Then one accepts one’s measure,
And guards one’s inch of land with depth.
If the Way is lost in the self,
Then one gallops and hunts recklessly,
And the heart grows mad,
While the inch of land is already lost.

Thus, no guilt is greater than desiring what is desirable,
No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No blame is greater than coveting acquisition—
All are transgressions of not accepting one’s measure.
When this becomes extreme, contention and plunder follow.
If one can accept the measure of life and destiny,
And return desires to their source,
Maintaining clarity and purity in self-cultivation,
Then sufficiency is found within the self—
How could there be insufficiency?
This is how the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Door**
Not leaving the door, one knows the world;
Not peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,
Sees without looking yet names,
Achieves without doing.

The world—
The nine regions, mountains, rivers, seas—
Teeming with ceaseless generation.
The Way of Heaven—
The four seasons, Yin and Yang, winds and rains—
Endless transformation.

Reflecting upon the self,
Nothing is not perfectly rounded.
Thus the Sage says:
“I share with Heaven and Earth one breath and govern together.”
If one understands this,
Then one need not leave the door or peer through the window
To know and see the Way of Heaven and Earth.
If one seeks the Way beyond the self,
Then the farther one goes, the less one knows.
How could one not know that within one body,
Ten thousand principles are all complete?
Taking from the near,
Nothing is insufficient.

Thus the Sage embodies Earth’s Way,
With emptiness as the body,
So he acts without moving yet knows,
Without need to leave the door;
Embodies Heaven’s Way,
With non-action as the heart,
So he sees without looking yet names,
Without need to peer through the window;
Embodies the Great Way,
With naturalness as the constant,
So he achieves without doing,
Without need to exert intelligence in what is seen or done.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Learning and Daily Decline**
Daily learning increases,
Daily practice of the Way decreases.
Decrease again and again,
Until reaching non-action yet nothing remains undone.
Thus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.
But when affairs arise,
They are insufficient to take the world.

The scholar seeks to exhaust principles,
Thus daily increase.
The practitioner of the Way seeks to perfect nature,
Thus daily decrease.
Decrease again and again,
Until perfecting nature to its end—
This is reaching destiny.
Principles have an end,
Nature has an exhaustion,
Yet one is not yet free from doing,
Thus it is called learning and practicing the Way.
Only when destiny is reached,
Does one return to the root—stillness.
Stillness is called returning to destiny,
Until reaching non-action.

Non-action—
The time of tranquil, unmoving stillness—
Yet when moved, it responds and communicates with the world,
Thus it is also action.
Hence, non-action yet nothing remains undone.

If there is any doing,
One cannot avoid entangling in affairs;
If there is no doing,
One cannot avoid severing connection with things.
How does the Sage act in the world?
He merely dwells in non-affairs.
Dwelling in non-affairs,
Only then can one take the world.
Thus, to take the world is always through non-affairs.

Yet the world’s sacred instrument
Cannot be forced—
Forcing it ruins it,
Clutching it loses it.
When affairs arise,
They are still insufficient to take the world.
Knowing the world cannot be taken through affairs,
One must instead learn what is not learned,
To reach the Way of non-action.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**

**Chapter Fifty: The Sage’s Birth and Death**

The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The virtuous, I treat as virtuous;
The wicked, I also treat as virtuous—*virtue* is thus established.
The trustworthy, I trust them;
The untrustworthy, I also trust them—*virtue* is thus established in trust.

The Sage moves in the world,
His heart blurred for all under Heaven,
While the people fix their ears and eyes upon him—
The Sage treats them all as children.

The Sage seeks to return to the origin,
To revert to the unborn—
Thus he has no fixed heart.
Virtue and vice, truth and deceit—
These are the deeds of men;
I harbor no partiality within,
But simply follow the hearts of the people as my own.

When the people act virtuously, I do not know it;
When the people act wickedly, I do not know it.
Accumulate virtue, and virtuous *qi* arrives—
I do not know it as virtue, so the virtuous, I treat as virtuous.
Accumulate vice, and wicked *qi* arrives—
I do not know it as wickedness, so the wicked, I also treat as virtuous.
Trust and distrust are the same.

Let it unfold naturally—I harbor no falsehood within,
Thus *virtue* is established in both virtue and trust.

Thus, aligning the virtuous and wicked,
Unifying truth and deceit,
My heart remains unattached to any side—
Hence, my heart is blurred for all under Heaven.

The people always have desires,
Chasing the pleasures of sound and color,
Thus they fix their ears and eyes,
Unknowing how to withdraw their gaze or return their hearing,
To guard the Mother’s Way.

Only the Sage always has no heart,
Embracing the origin of all under Heaven,
Returning to guard the Mother of all under Heaven—
Thus he treats them all as children.

**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death**
Birth and death—
The followers of life are thirteen,
The followers of death are thirteen,
And the ways of life that lead to death are also thirteen.

Why is this so?
Because of the excess of life’s life.

**Chapter Fifty: Birth and Death (continued)**

Thus, the Master who skillfully guards life
Walks upon land yet meets no rhinoceros or tiger,
Enters battle yet is not struck by armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
The tiger finds no place to strike its claws,
Weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this so?
Because there is no place of death for him.

All things arise from the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—this is called life,
And return to the transformations of yin and yang—this is called death.
Those who follow life and death
Have not escaped the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Nor have they avoided the transformations of yin and yang.
Yet, all things are born and die,
While only humanity’s life is said to stir death’s domain thirteenfold—why?
This is all self-inflicted by the people,
Not Heaven and Earth’s destruction,
Nor the harm of ghosts and spirits—
For they possess knowledge and their forms move.

They cannot turn away from life’s approach when seen,
Nor halt death’s departure when it comes—why?
Because of life’s excessive vitality,
And the stirring of death’s domain.
Only the Sage embraces subtlety and simplicity,
Holding to the uncarved and unadorned,
Daring not to act or contend with the world.
Though fierce beasts may be present, they cannot seize him,
Though weapons may be drawn, they cannot harm him.
For his accumulated virtue is profound and boundless,
And nothing can injure him—
Hence, there is no place of death for him.

**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao/Way Gives Life**
The Dao/Way gives life,
Virtue/power nurtures it,
Form shapes it,
Conditions perfect it—
Thus, all things honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power.

The Dao/Way’s honor,
Virtue/power’s nobility—
No one bestows these titles,
Yet they remain ever natural.
Therefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,
Lengthens it and rears it,
Perfects it and ripens it,
Nourishes it and protects it.
Giving life yet not possessing it,
Acting yet not claiming it,
Lengthening yet not controlling it—
This is called profound virtue/power.

Where does the Dao/Way arise to give life?
It gathers the true and harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
And all things follow to be born—
This is how the Dao/Way gives life—
Hence, it is said: *The Dao/Way gives life, virtue/power nurtures it.*

Where do forms arise?
Following the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,
And the transformations of yin and yang—
All things follow to be formed—
This is how forms arise—
Hence, it is said: *Form shapes it, conditions perfect it.*

Because the Dao/Way can give life,
All things bow to it—
This is called honoring the Dao/Way.
Because virtue/power can nurture life,
All things cannot belittle it—
This is called valuing virtue/power.

Only the Dao/Way and virtue/power dwell above the accumulated *yang*,
Not seeking honor or nobility from things—
Things honor and value themselves,
For from ancient times to the present,
No titles are bestowed yet they remain ever natural.

Therefore, the Dao/Way gives life and nurtures it,
Lengthens it and rears it,
Perfects it and ripens it,
Nourishes it and protects it—
This is the Dao/Way acting naturally between Heaven and Earth.

If one gives life yet does not possess it,
Acts yet does not claim it,
Lengthens yet does not control it—
This is the common practice of Heaven and Earth,
Hence, it is called profound virtue/power.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: Heaven and Earth as the Origin of All Under Heaven**
All under Heaven has its origin,
Which we call the Mother of all under Heaven.
Having obtained its Mother,
We know its children—
Having known its children,
We return to guard its Mother,
And thus our life is never endangered.

Block the *fui* (mouth/opening),
Close the gate—
And thus we never tire throughout our lives.
Open the *fui*,
Advance our affairs—
And thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.

Seeing what is small is called clarity,
Guarding what is soft is called strength.
Using its light,
Yet returning to its clarity—
We suffer no harm to our bodies,
This is called following the constant.

One life of Heaven and Earth,
And then all under Heaven has its origin—
Thus we call it the Mother of all under Heaven.
Having obtained Heaven and Earth,
As the Mother of all under Heaven,
We then know that all things are her children.
Having known her children,
Yet returning to guard the Mother—
Then all her children are preserved.

People only know Heaven and Earth and all things,
Yet do not know their own source of life.
If one knows this source,
And returns to guard the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Then one’s life is never endangered.

Therefore, those who embody the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth
Engage in non-action,
Practice the teaching of no words—
Hence, it is said: *Block the fui, close the gate,*
And thus we never tire throughout our lives.
Those who do not know the Dao/Way
Engage in much speech and action,
And thus lose guard of the Mother’s Dao/Way
By attending to worldly affairs—
Hence, it is said: *Open the fui, advance our affairs,*
And thus we never find salvation throughout our lives.

The small is the uncarved of Heaven and Earth,
The soft is the subtle application of the Dao/Way—
Only by self-knowledge can one see the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Hence, it is called clarity.
Only by self-mastery can one guard the subtlety of the Dao/Way,
Hence, it is called strength.

Clarity is the harmonization of yin and yang,
And light arises from clarity—
Using non-action,
Within oneself, wisdom and intent are present.
The Sage discards wisdom and knowledge,
Not relying on them yet illuminating the Dao/Way of Heaven—
Hence, he uses its light
And returns to its clarity.
Light shining outward is called suffering harm—
To suffer no harm to oneself yet return to clarity,
This is called following the constant.

Thus, one can guard the Mother’s Dao/Way.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Thief of the Dao/Way**
If I were to have knowledge and walk the Great Dao/Way,
I would only fear this one thing:
The Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,
Yet people love shortcuts.

Morning is neglected,
Fields grow overgrown,
Granaries lie empty—
Yet they wear ornate attire,
Gird on sharp blades,
Sicken of food and drink,
And hoard wealth—
This is called the thief of the Dao/Way,
Not the Dao/Way itself.

The streams of mountain paths,
If used, become roads—
If not, are choked with weeds.
The people of the world do not know the subtlety of the Great Dao/Way,
Yet they act and contrive—
This is how they bring weeds to their hearts.

Knowledge’s movement is called action,
Action’s artifice is called loss—
Thus, those with knowledge fear and dare not act.
The Great Dao/Way is exceedingly smooth,
Yet when viewed, it is unseen—
People’s hearts desire speed,
Thus they love shortcuts and forever stray from the Great Dao/Way.

Moreover, the heart is the sovereign’s office—
Thus when the heart is disturbed, even a single *mu* (inch) of land is lost.
When a single *mu* of land is lost,
The harmonious *qi* does not descend—
When the harmonious *qi* does not descend,
The great granary is emptied—
Hence, it is said: *Morning is neglected, fields grow overgrown, granaries lie empty.*

Because of this,
They create distinctions of high and low,
And strange contests of contention—
They crave the delicacy of the five flavors,
Hence, they wear ornate attire,
Gird on sharp blades,
Sicken of food and drink—
And when wealth is abundant,
They gather the roots of all harm.

This is called the endeavor of robbing the Dao/Way and plundering the self,
Yet those who do not know
Still boast of their own talents and abilities without ceasing—
This can be called *theft of boasting*, which is not the Dao/Way, is it?

**Chapter 54: The Good Foundation Does Not Uproot**

The good foundation does not uproot,
The good embrace does not loosen—
Thus, descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.

Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true;
Cultivate it in one’s family, and its virtue/power becomes abundant;
Cultivate it in one’s village, and its virtue/power becomes enduring;
Cultivate it in one’s state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing;
Cultivate it throughout the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.

Therefore, observe oneself through oneself,
Observe one’s family through one’s family,
Observe one’s village through one’s village,
Observe one’s state through one’s state,
Observe the world through the world.

How do I know this is so throughout the world?
Because of this.

The foundation is the one who creates beginnings and takes action.
Only the Dao/Way establishes virtue/power and discerns—
It stands firm, erecting heaven and earth, unshaken—
This is the moment when the One *qi* is divided into the Two Principles (阴陽/yin-yang).

The embrace is the one who adheres without separation.
Only virtue/power embraces the Dao/Way and gives birth—
It nurtures all things, unbroken—
This is the time when the One *qi* is dispersed to form myriad kinds.

All things share the same origin in the One *qi*,
Yet only humanity is most refined—
Thus, it becomes the progenitor of all things,
The origin of heaven and earth.

In this foundation and embrace, taking the world as One,
Descendants will continue sacrifices without ceasing,
And all within the Four Seas will come with their duties.

This Dao/Way, I trace its beginning—
It stems from cultivating oneself.

Once the Dao/Way’s truth is used to govern oneself,
Its threads extend to the state,
Its soil spreads to the world.

From one self to the world,
Its cultivation becomes ever broader,
Its virtue/power ever more advanced.

Cultivating oneself: though the spirit resides in the body,
It first conceals heaven and earth,
Quietly abides at the origin of all things,
And lets the mind not dwell in the body—
This is what is meant by *cultivating oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true*.

From this, though one is in the family,
The mind does not dwell in the family—
This is what is meant by *cultivating the family, and its virtue/power becomes abundant*.

Though one is in the village,
The mind does not dwell in the village—
This is what is meant by *cultivating the village, and its virtue/power becomes enduring*.

Though one is in the state,
The mind does not dwell in the state—
This is what is meant by *cultivating the state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing*.

Though one is in the world,
The mind does not dwell in the world—
This is what is meant by *cultivating the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal*.

Therefore, *observing oneself through oneself* means
Introspecting deeply and gazing within to behold one’s own virtue/power.

As for observing one’s family, village, state,
And even the world—
The Sage has no room for partiality in their heart,
Each observes themselves naturally,
Thus attaining harmony effortlessly.

How do I know this is so throughout the world?
Because of this.

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Profound Virtue of the Embracing Virtue**

The profound virtue of embracing virtue
Is likened to the infant:
Poisonous serpents do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Snatching birds do not clutch.

Bones are frail, sinews supple, yet their grasp is firm;
Unknowing of male and female union, yet erections arise—
This is the utmost of *jing* (精).

Crying all day, yet the throat is unhoarse—
This is the utmost of harmony.

To know harmony is to know constancy (*cháng* 常),
To know constancy is to know clarity (*míng* 明),
To take life as benefit is an omen (*xiáng* 祥),
To make *qi* strong with the heart is strength.

When things reach their peak, they grow old—
This is called *not-Dao*,
And *not-Dao* perishes early.

The infant’s nature
Is one with the Dao,
Its heavenly defenses complete,
Its spirit unbreached—
Thus the Sage does not lose the infant’s heart,
And the profound virtue of embracing virtue
Can be likened to the infant.

Such is the case:
Accumulating virtue in mysterious passage,
Hidden in Heaven, and nothing can harm it—
Thus poisonous serpents do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Snatching birds do not clutch.

Bones frail, sinews supple, yet grasp firm—
This is virtue complete in the Earthly Dao.

Earthly *qi* begins at *zi* (子),
The infant’s frail bones and supple sinews yet firm grasp—
This is the pure *qi*’s defense responding to the Earthly Dao.

Unknowing of male-female union yet erections arise—
This is the utmost of *jing*—
Virtue complete in the constant Dao.

The constant Dao’s essence is most true:
The infant, unknowing of male-female union, yet sometimes erect—
This is the Dao’s true essence responding in humanity.

Crying all day, yet the throat unhoarse—
This is the utmost of harmony—
Virtue complete in the Heavenly Dao.

Heaven governs sound,
For its undivided yin-yang *qi* is harmonious—
Thus it cries all day, yet the throat unhoarse.

To know harmony is to know yin-yang blending as one—
Thus it is called constancy (*cháng*).

To know constancy is to know yin-yang merging yet undivided—
Thus it is called clarity (*míng*).

The infant’s nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,
Its virtue does not take life as benefit.

To reverse and take life as benefit—
This is the sign of entering the death-ground’s movement—
This is called an omen (*xiáng*).

Once life is taken as benefit,
Then one must make *qi* strong with the heart—
This is the kind of rigid strength.

Beginning with taking life as benefit,
Ending with things reaching their peak and growing old—
This is called *not-Dao*,
And *not-Dao* perishes early.

**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**

The wise do not speak,
Those who speak are not wise.

「塞其兑，闭其门，挫其锐，解其纷，和其光，同其尘，
This is called *playing the role of the Mysterious Unity*—
Thus one cannot approach it too closely, nor keep it too distant,
Cannot profit from it, nor harm by it,
Cannot honor it, nor belittle it—
Hence it is most honored by the world.

The Dao/Way is naturally simple,
Those who act can attain it,
Those who hear can speak of it—
Yet why do they speak?
Speaking to attain it is merely the silent recognition of intent,
Never seen in the verbose debates of eloquence—
Hence it is said: *The wise do not speak.*

Those who do not know the Dao/Way,
Speak to trouble one another—
When they neither hear nor speak,
They do not know how to attain it—
Hence it is said: *Those who speak are not wise.*

Only the Sage understands the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,
Possessing great virtue yet never speaking of it—
Hence they *block their senses* and *close their gates*,
*Plaster their orifices* and *guard their spirit* while *retiring into the hidden*.

When they emerge to benefit the world,
In embodying the Dao/Way of Heaven,
They *dull their sharpness* and *harmonize their radiance*—
In embodying the Dao/Way of Earth,
They *resolve their tumult* and *blend with dust*.

The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is thus called *Mysterious Unity*—
The Mysterious Unity contains both bright and dark,
Hence it unites with the *Ultimate One* and aligns with Heaven and Earth.

The Dao/Way of Heaven has no favorites,
Thus one cannot approach it too closely—
And since one cannot approach it too closely,
One cannot keep it too distant either.

The Dao/Way of Earth has no desires,
Thus one cannot profit from it—
And since one cannot profit from it,
One cannot harm by it either.

The Great Dao/Way has no form,
Thus one cannot honor it—
And since one cannot honor it,
One cannot belittle it either.

If such is the case,
Then it is fitting to be most honored by the world.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Govern with Rectitude, Employ the Unusual**

To govern with rectitude,
To employ the unusual in warfare,
To take the world by doing nothing—

How do I know this is so?
For when the world abounds in taboos,
The people grow ever poorer;
When people hoard sharp implements,
The state grows ever more corrupt;
When people indulge in clever artifices,
Strange things proliferate;
When laws and decrees become explicit,
Thieves and robbers abound.

Thus the Sage says:
*"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves,
I do nothing, yet the people grow rich,
I love tranquility, yet the people become upright,
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity."*

It is heard that the Sage *nurtures the world* with leniency,
Not that they *govern the world*—
For the world cannot be governed,
Hence one must govern with rectitude and employ the unusual in warfare.

Rectitude itself becomes the unusual,
Then there arises the calamity of warfare—
*Blessing and disaster are intertwined*—
Who can know their limits?

Therefore the Sage takes the world by doing nothing.

By doing nothing, they follow Earth’s Dao/Way and love tranquility,
By loving tranquility, they follow Heaven’s Dao/Way and act without action,
By acting without action, they follow the Great Dao/Way and have no desires,
By having no desires, the world naturally returns to them.

How do I know this is so?
For governance arises from *action*—
And when one loses the *Teaching of the Supreme Sage* that is *without words*,
Taboos and prohibitions multiply—
Thus the four classes shift their occupations and grow ever poorer.
The people grow poor, and they seek sharp implements for profit,
Greed and corruption flourish—
Thus the state grows ever more corrupt.
Indulgence in clever artifices and rare treasures,
Strange things proliferate—
From this, profit and harm attack one another,
Laws and decrees become explicit,
Severe punishments reach their utmost—
The people have no respite for life,
Thus thieves and robbers abound.
The use of unusual warfare stems from this,
This is the extreme of governing with rectitude.

Therefore the Sage does nothing,
And the state is strong while the people are rich—
Thus taboos do not arise.
Loving tranquility, the world naturally becomes upright—
Thus sharp implements are not created.
Acting without action, the ten thousand people transform themselves—
What use are clever artifices?
Having no desires, the people return to simplicity—
What thieves or robbers would there be?
This is the way of taking the world by doing nothing.

Their governance is *obscure and harmonious*—
**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Their Governance is Obscure**

Their governance is *obscure and harmonious*,
Their people are *pure and simple*—
Their governance is *explicit and probing*,
Their people are *deceitful and cunning*.

Disaster! *Blessing is its foundation*,
*Blessing! Disaster is its seed*—
Who can know their limits?
Is there no rectitude or deviation?
Rectitude itself becomes the unusual,
Goodness itself becomes *evil*—
The people’s confusion has lasted long.

Thus the Sage is *square without cutting*,
*Clean without piercing*,
*Straight without excess*,
*Bright without dazzling*.

In the age of the *Supreme Sage*,
They dwell in *non-action*,
Practice the *Teaching of the Unspoken*—
The world knows of their existence yet does not know of their governance,
Thus their governance is *without rectitude*—
Those who naturally embody *obscure and harmonious* governance,
Have governance yet do not enforce it.

When governance is not enforced,
It is not to enlighten the people,
But to befuddle them—
Thus their people are *pure and simple*, as if naive.

Yet once governance is established to rectify,
There must be *explicit and probing* decrees—
Thus it begins with *obscure and harmonious* yet ends in *explicit and probing*.
To end in *explicit and probing* is the extreme of governance.

When governance becomes too probing,
The people have no recourse—
Thus they become *deceitful and cunning*.

The Sage speaks only of seeking blessings,
Never of punishing crimes—
Only of preserving life,
Never of mutilating form—
For blessings and disasters are intertwined,
This is the natural order—
Hence it is said: *Who can know their limits? Is there no rectitude or deviation?*

The people of the world take governance as rectitude,
Not knowing that rectitude’s extreme gives rise to the unusual—
They take blessings as goodness,
Not knowing that goodness’s excess breeds *evil*—
Confusion begets confusion,
And this has lasted long.

Thus the Sage is *square like the thickness of great virtue*,
Hence they do not *cut*—
Clean like the purity of supreme virtue,
Hence they do not *pierce*—
Straight yet not *applied outwardly*,
Bright yet *reflected inwardly*—
No rectitude to enforce,
No unusual to probe—
This is called the *Dao/Way without limits*.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Govern People, Serve Heaven**

To govern people and serve Heaven,
Nothing surpasses *frugality*.

For only *frugality* is called *early return*—
*Early return* is *accumulating virtue in earnest*—
To accumulate virtue in earnest is to have no failure—
To have no failure is to know no limits—
To know no limits is to have a lasting state.

The *foundation of a lasting state*,
Can endure forever.»

**Chapter Sixty: Deep Roots and Firm Foundations, the Dao of Longevity and Vision**

This is called the *Dao/Way of deep roots and firm foundations*,
The *Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision*.

*Frugality* (啬) is *restraint* (敛),
*Accumulation* (畜),
*Returning to virtue* (归之於德).
Expressed outwardly, it is called *restraint*;
Spoken inwardly, it is called *accumulation*.

*Restraint* outwardly reaches *without desire*,
Thus they *postpone* their own bodies,
*Externally* their own bodies,
So they may *govern people*.

*Accumulation* inwardly reaches *without knowledge*,
Thus they *preserve* their hearts,
*Nourish* their *nature* (性),
So they may *serve Heaven*.

Externally, without desire, they follow the *stillness of Earth* (地) and *fulfill their nature* (尽性);
Internally, without knowledge, they *embody Heaven’s functions* (体天之用) and *return to the original command* (复命).

To *fulfill their nature* (尽性) and *return to the original command* (复命),
This is *reverting back to guard its source*—
Hence it is called *early return* (早复).

*Early* (早) means the sun rises at the *beginning of the Jia-Yang* (甲阳);
To *revert and guard its source* (复守其母),
Is to *align with Heaven and Earth in virtue*—
This is called *accumulating virtue in earnest* (重积德).

*Accumulating virtue* (积德) is *profoundly harmonious*,
*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),
Thus there is no failure—
*Aligned with the true Dao* (与道合真),
It is *inexhaustible and boundless*—
Hence its limits are *unknowable*.

*Inexhaustible and boundless* (难终难穷),
All ten thousand principles are *fully manifest*—
Hence it can *have a lasting state*.

The *foundation of a lasting state*,
Is the *Dao/Way*—
Neither *rigidly square* (不方) nor *circularly confined* (不圆),
Parallel with *Heaven and Earth*—
Hence it can endure forever.

*Beginning with guarding its source* (始於守母),
This is called *deepening its roots*;
*Ending with returning to the original command* (终於复命),
This is called *firming its foundation*.
To *obtain Heaven and Earth as constants* (得天地为常) while the *Five Phases do not mutually subdue* (五行不相克),
To *align with the Great Dao as One* (与大道为一) while the *Three Lights* (三光) remain *unilluminated and obscure* (无明冥),
This is called the *Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision*.

**Chapter Sixty: Governing Great States Like Simmering Small Fish**

To govern great states,
Is like *simmering small fresh fish* (烹小鲜).

To *apply the Dao/Way to rule the world* (以道莅天下),
Their *spirits* (鬼) are not *divine* (神).
Not that their *spirits are not divine*,
But that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*;
Not that the *divine spirits do not harm the people*,
The Sage also does not harm the people.

Thus, *both do not harm each other*—
Hence their *virtue/power* (德) *returns and exchanges* (交归).

To govern by the *Dao/Way* values *purity and clarity* (清浄),
And the people *self-regulate* (民自定).
Do not *act upon* them—
Hence, governing great states is like *simmering small fresh fish*.

From the perspective of humanity,
Great states are *Heaven’s central earthly gateways* (天中地户),
The *domain of the Yellow Emperor* (黄帝之乡),
Thus they are governed in this manner.

Hence the Sage *acts in non-action* (处无为之事),
With a *single heart settled* (一心定),
And *rules the world* (而王天下).
Thus the *spirits* have no place to *manifest their divine resonance* (出其灵响),
Relying on humanity to move—
What *divinity* is there?

Not that their *spirits are not divine*—
Because they *do not receive evil* (不受於邪),
Evil *qi* *spontaneously departs* (邪气自去),
Thus the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*.

Not that the *divine spirits do not harm humanity*—
Because the Sage *acts in non-action*,
And the world *transforms harmoniously* (化成),
Making the people *externally free from strife, contention, or warfare* (无争夺攻战之患),
*Internally free from scheming, murder, or resentment* (无图为杀怨之心),
Not *offending divine retribution* (不犯神之报应),
Thus the Sage also does not harm the people.

When *humanity and spirits* (人与鬼神) *both do not harm each other*,
The *spirits* grant *abundant blessings* (予矣, 贻尔多福),
*Returning virtue to the spirits*—
The people *simplify* (质矣),
*Daily nourishment and sustenance* (日用饮食),
*Returning virtue to humanity*.

*Returning virtue to the spirits*,
Thus their descendants *sacrifice without ceasing* (子孙以祭祀不辍).
*Returning virtue to humanity*,
Thus the world *joyfully follows* (天下乐推),
*Never tiring* (而不厌).

This is the *effect* (效) of the Sage *applying the Dao/Way to rule the world*.

---

**Chapter Sixty-One: Great States as the Lowly Flow**

Great states are *lowly flows* (下流),
The *nexus of the world* (天下之交),
The *receptive* (牝) of the world.

The *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),
And *stillness is lowly* (静为下).
Thus, when great states *lower themselves to the small* (以下小国),
They *take the small*;
When small states *lower themselves to the great* (小国以下大国),
They *take the great*.
Thus, *either lower to take* (或下以取),
*Or lower and take* (或下而取).

Great states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people* (兼畜人),
Small states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great* (入事人).
Both *obtain what they desire*—
Hence the *great should be lowly* (大者宜为下).

Water *excel in flowing downward*—
Thus the *Yangtze and seas can rule all valleys* (江海能为百谷王).
Great states desire to *comprehend and nourish people*—
This is also achieved through their *lowly flow*—
Hence it is said, *great states are lowly flows*.

The world’s *nexus* (交),
All things *generate*;
Human *nexus* (道交),
*Merits and achievements are fulfilled*—
This is called the *nexus of the world*—
Yet it must *first be treated with gentleness and stillness* (自处以柔静).

The *receptive* (牝) is always *stillness overcomes the active* (静胜牡),
And the *active* (牡) *returns to it*—
Because *stillness is lowly* (静为下).

*Stillness* means *no affairs*—
Only *no affairs* can *take the world*—
And what of *states*?

Thus, when great states *lower themselves to the small*,
They *take the small*;
When small states *lower themselves to the great*,
They *take the great*.

*Either lower to take* (或下以取),
Is the *Dao/Way of the sovereign* (君道).
*Or lower and take* (或下而取),
Is the *Dao/Way of the minister* (臣道).

The *sovereign* is like *Heaven*—
Heaven’s *Dao/Way* flows *downward to aid* (下济) while *radiant and clear*—
Thus great states *do not exceed* their desire to *comprehend and nourish people*.

The *minister* is like *Earth*—
Earth’s *Dao/Way* is *lowly yet ascends* (卑而上行)—
Thus small states *do not exceed* their desire to *enter and serve the great*.

When *Heaven and Earth exchange* (交),
All things *generate*;
When *human nexus* (道交) is fulfilled,
*Merits and achievements are completed*—
Thus both *obtain what they desire*.

Yet those who should *flow downward* (宜下流者),
Are only great states—
Hence it is again said, *the great should be lowly*.

---

**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**

The *Dao/Way* (道) is the *mystery of all things* (万物之奥),
The *treasure of the virtuous* (善人之宝),
The *protection of the unvirtuous* (不善人之所保).

*Graceful words* (美言) can *win favor* (可以市),
*Noble conduct* (尊行) can *elevate one* (可以加人).
Humanity’s unvirtue—
What can be *abandoned*?
Hence the *establishment of the Son of Heaven* (立天子),
The *appointment of the Three Ministers* (置三公),
Even with *a jade tablet and white horses* (拱璧以先驷马),
Is *not as valuable* as *sitting and presenting this Dao* (不如坐进此道).

Why did the ancients *value this Dao*?
Was it not for *seeking and obtaining* (求以得),
Or *pardoning faults* (有罪以免)?

Thus it is *precious for the world*.

The *Dao/Way* is the *abyss of emptiness and nothingness* (虚无之渊),
All see *things* (物) yet *do not see the Dao* (不见乎道),
Hence it is called the *mystery of all things*.

The *mystery of attaining the Dao* (得道之妙),
Is the *treasure of life and nature* (性命之宝).
The *mystery of speaking the Dao* (得道之言),
Is unvirtue—
Yet even the unvirtuous *find protection in the Dao*.

*Win favor* (市) is where *the masses gather* (众人之所归).
*Elevate one* (加) is to *place them above the masses* (置诸众人之上).
Graceful words and noble conduct—
Even the unvirtuous in humanity,
Are *sufficient to gain the masses and rise above them*.

The *Way* is not to be abandoned—thus the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Ministers and sits to discuss the Dao.

If one presents a jade tablet with four horses ahead, one may still attain noble speech and conduct, gather the masses, and rise above them. Yet even so, it is not as good as sitting and advancing the Dao of *wuwei*—for its subtlety surpasses all else.

Why did the ancients value this Dao? Was it not because it is the treasure of life and nature—seeking it brings attainment, and it preserves life itself? Is it merely to pardon faults?

Thus, it is held precious by all under Heaven.

**Chapter 63: *Wuwei* (無為)**
*Wuwei* in action, *wuwei* in affairs, *wuwei* in taste.
Great and small, much and little—repay resentment with virtue.
Attempt the difficult in its ease, achieve the great in its smallness.
The difficult things of the world arise from the easy;
the great things of the world arise from the small.
Thus the Sage never acts in greatness,
and so achieves true greatness.

Light promises bring few truths;
many easy things bring many difficulties.
Therefore the Sage regards even the easy with caution,
and so never faces true difficulty.

The Sage embodies the Dao of Heaven in silent teaching—
thus *wuwei* in action;
embodies the constant Dao in *wuwei* affairs—
thus *wuwei* in affairs;
embodies the Dao of Earth in simple joys—
thus *wuwei* in taste.

From the perspective of what it *appears* to do,
it seems to have action, affairs, and taste.
From the perspective of what it *holds*,
its action is *wuwei*,
its affairs are *wuwei*,
its taste is *wuwei*—and nothing more.

The world does not understand this,
so they act boldly and incur resentment,
begin with small things and reach greatness,
begin with little and reach abundance—
all because they are fixated on deeds and desires.

Yet greatness and smallness, much and little,
follow their kind in return,
all arising from self-attainment—
Heaven and Earth respond like echoes.
Thus it is said: *Repay resentment with virtue.*

From this, we see:
The world’s difficult things arise from the easy and become difficult;
the world’s great things arise from the small and become great.
Thus calamities arise unexpectedly,
disasters from the slightest threads—
is this not so?

Therefore the Sage aligns with Heaven to act with Heaven,
and so never acts in greatness;
unites with the Dao as one,
and so achieves true greatness.

Those who make light promises and act too easily
damage themselves by their recklessness in action—
thus they lack trust and invite many difficulties.

The Sage practices silent teaching,
so there is no lack of trust in action;
dwells in *wuwei* affairs,
delights in simple joys,
so there is no excess of difficulty;
lets things unfold naturally without forcing—
and so never faces true difficulty.

**Chapter 64: *An Ease to Hold***
That which is stable is easy to hold;
that which is not yet manifest is easy to plan;
that which is fragile is easy to shatter;
that which is subtle is easy to disperse.

Act before things exist;
govern before things are disordered.

A tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout;
a nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;
a thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.

The doer brings ruin;
the grasper loses hold.
Thus the Sage acts in *wuwei* and knows no ruin;
holds nothing and knows no loss.

Yet the people, in their affairs,
often ruin what is nearly complete.
If one treats the end as carefully as the beginning,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus the Sage desires what others do not desire,
values not what is hard to obtain;
learns what others do not learn,
returning to the errors of the common people,
aiding the natural unfolding of all things—
and dares not act.

Before disturbances arise, it is easy to plan and hold—
this is *acting before things exist*.
Once fragility and subtlety have taken form,
it is easy to disperse and scatter—
this is *governing before disorder*.

Yet to act before things exist—
can one truly avoid thought?
To govern before disorder—
can one truly avoid strategy?

Thus the Sage says:
Planning is the beginning of peril;
peril, once begun, will not last long.
Better to take heed at the outset,
forgetting the act before it begins,
forgetting governance before it is needed—
this is the greater wisdom.

Greatness arises from smallness,
height from lowliness,
distance from nearness—
this is the way of things.

The doer brings ruin;
the grasper loses hold.
Only the Sage, seeing the beginning,
considers the end;
glimpsing the path,
knows the destination.
Thus *wuwei*—no ruin;
no grasping—no loss.

Yet the people, in their affairs,
cannot escape action and governance,
and do not heed warnings.
Their desires grow ever stronger,
true harmony exhausted—
so they ruin what is nearly complete.
How could it be otherwise?

If one treats the end as carefully as the beginning,
returns to the simplicity of an infant at its mother’s side,
there will be no ruined undertakings.

Thus the Sage desires what others do not desire,
seeks no external action—
even rare treasures are not prized.
Learns what others do not learn,
seeks no internal mastery—
even noble speech and conduct are not revered.
Returns to the errors of the common people,
aids the natural unfolding of all things—
and dares not act.

**Chapter 65: *The Ancient Masters of the Dao***
The ancients who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people—
they sought to keep them simple.

The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is excessive.
Thus governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.

Knowing these two principles is the *mystic virtue*.
The *mystic virtue* is profound and distant,
contrary to things—
and only then does it reach the greatest harmony.

The Dao, in *wuwei*, attains self-attainment within;
the Dao, in *wuwei* action, transforms without.
Thus the ancients who excelled in the Dao
did not seek to enlighten the people—
they sought to keep them simple.

Enlightenment corrupts the pure and brings chaos;
simplicity preserves the genuine and brings stillness.
Moreover, the people can be led but not instructed.
The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is excessive and their knowledge is great.

Cleverness is the tool of contention—
thus governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state,
not because it is enlightening, but because it is clever.
Not governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing,
not because it is simplifying, but because it is wise.

The ruin of the state lies in opening the people’s minds—
opening the people’s minds is the ruin of life.

The blessing of the state lies in *opening heaven*—virtue gives life.

These two principles are models to emulate and patterns to follow. To know the models, one must then observe the Dao, hence it is called *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue). *Xuan De* is the highest virtue, thus profound and far-reaching. Nothing can pair with it except aligning with the great harmony, hence one must reverse with things to attain the great harmony.

**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys (Jianghai)**
Jianghai becomes the king of all valleys because it excels in humility, thus it rules over all valleys. Therefore, the Sage desires to be above others by speaking humbly, to lead others by placing himself last. Thus, when the Sage is above, the people do not feel burdened; when he is before, the people are not harmed. Hence, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion. Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.

Jianghai, by its excellence in humility, receives the flow of all valleys and becomes their king. The king has the principle of returning and going, thus the noble humble themselves, the great humble themselves, and the people are gained.

Therefore, the Sage embodies the Dao of Heaven and speaks humbly, so when he is above, the people do not feel burdened, hence they follow him lightly. He embodies the Dao of Earth and places himself last, so when he is before, the people are not harmed, hence those who benefit him are many. Thus, from the west to the east, from the south to the north, none fail to submit willingly, hence all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.

Essentially, the reason for this is nothing more than excellence in humility. Only those who excel in humility do not contend with things, hence none under heaven can contend with them.

**Chapter 67: All Under Heaven Say**
All under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unskilled. Only because it is great does it seem unskilled. If it were skilled, it would have been long ago. I possess three treasures; I hold them fast. The first is *ci* (compassion), the second is *jian* (frugality), the third is *not daring to act first under heaven*.

Compassion makes one courageous; frugality makes one vast. Not daring to act first under heaven makes one the vessel and leader. Now, if one abandons compassion and courage, abandons frugality and vastness, abandons humility and acting first, one dies.

Compassion—when waging war, one wins; when defending, one is steadfast. Heaven, intending to save it, guards it with compassion. Those who imitate things are small; those imitated by things are great.

The Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, fills the six extremes, vast and great—thus it seems unskilled. Heaven is great, Earth is great; they imitate the Dao, hence they endure. Yet Heaven and Earth are but a small thing within the void—compared to the Dao, they are also small. Thus I hold fast to my three treasures.

The first, *ci* (compassion), is the fatherly Dao, the master of creation—speaking of Heaven. The second, *jian* (frugality), is the motherly Dao, the master of nurturing and gathering—speaking of Earth. The third, *not daring to act first under heaven*, is the origin of Heaven and Earth—responding only after being moved, never acting first—speaking of the Dao.

Heaven, Earth, and the Dao together are used, then serene and boundless, with all virtues following. No treasures surpass these three. All people possess them; they should be cherished and not lost, held as the highest.

The Dao of Heaven gives birth and covers—this is called compassion. Though compassionate, it does not contend yet wins—thus compassion makes one courageous. The Dao of Earth nurtures and gathers—this is called frugality. Though frugal, its virtue extends boundlessly—thus frugality makes one vast.

Only the great Dao encompasses the origins of Heaven and Earth; though it does not dare act first under heaven, life and transformation depend on it, hence it becomes the vessel and leader. If one opposes Heaven and Earth and severs the great Dao, then one dies.

Compassion in war brings victory—it battles *yin* with *yang*. In defense, it is steadfast—embracing the Dao of the Mysterious. Moreover, when contending with disorder, waiting for the time to act, then victory is achieved by responding. If it cannot move, it defends with harmony, and Heaven’s timing also guards it firmly, hence Heaven intends to save it, guarding it with compassion.

**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**
The virtuous warrior is not martial; the virtuous fighter does not rage; the virtuous victor does not contend; the virtuous user of people places himself below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven—ancient perfection.

The virtuous warrior cherishes the Dao of the three treasures, not using force to overpower under heaven with arms. Thus, in waging war, this is virtuous fighting; in defeating enemies, this is virtuous victory; in using people, this is virtuous leadership.

The virtuous fighter waits for the time before acting, though fighting yet not raging—embodying the treasure of compassion. The virtuous victor considers victory before meeting, though victorious yet not contending—embodying the treasure of frugality. The virtuous leader does not scheme for himself but delights in using others, hence people willingly serve him—embodying the treasure of *not daring to act first under heaven*.

Those skilled in this are said to possess the virtue of non-contention, the strength of using people, aligning with Heaven. Yet ancient correctness becomes strange, thus there are warnings about using arms, hence it is called ancient perfection.

Who knows its perfection?

**Chapter 69: The Art of War**
The art of war has sayings: *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender, not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.* This is called *no action in action, no arm in defense, no rival in enmity, no weapon in grasp.*

No greater calamity than despising the enemy—despising the enemy nearly loses my treasures. Thus, when armies clash, the compassionate win.

The sayings of war clarify that these words are not mine but the common words of those who use arms. *I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender*—thus pressed, I act; compelled, I rise, never provoking others, only responding.

**Chapter 69 (continued): The Art of War**

Once compelled, it is not one who leaps forward to wage war but rather one who takes delight in killing—thus, he does not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot, hence the saying: *No action in action*.

*Shoeless yet no arms*—this is to fight well yet not grow angry.
*No rival in enmity*—this is to conquer the enemy yet not vie in conflict.
*No weapon in grasp*—this is to skillfully employ others while placing himself beneath them.
This is the profound understanding of the **Three Treasures** (三宝).

Yet the **Three Treasures** are not solely about wielding arms—why must ancient perfection descend to the art of war?
Arms are cruel instruments; one must not lightly despise the enemy, for despising the enemy is to take delight in killing.
Abandoning his **virtue/power** (德) yet embracing boldness, abandoning frugality yet seeking abundance, abandoning humility yet striving to be first—thus nearly losing his treasures.
Hence, when armies clash, those who pity and take compassion are **virtuous/powerful** (德), and if **virtue/power** (德) is held as treasure, there will be no calamity of despising the enemy, and thus victory is achieved.

**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easy to Know and Practice**
My words are easy to know, easy to practice—yet none under Heaven can know them or practice them.
Words have a **root/principle** (宗), matters have a **lord/master** (君).
It is only the ignorant who do not know me.
Few know me, so I am precious.
Thus, the **sage** (圣人) wears coarse robes yet holds jade within.

Without thought or deliberation, one begins to know the Dao/Way—thus it is easy to know.
Without following or seeking, one begins to obtain the Dao/Way—thus it is easy to practice.
Yet the wealthy and noble of the world indulge in desires and lose their **authenticity** (真), while the poor and lowly labor excessively and harm their lives—all losing themselves to things, their nature to customs, hence none can know or practice them.

Words having a **root/principle** (宗)—this clarifies the meaning of a chapter, its essence having a **root/principle** (宗)—is this not what is called easy to know?
Matters having a **lord/master** (君)—this clarifies the practice of a chapter, its conduct having a **lord/master** (君)—is this not what is called easy to practice?
If one does not lose its **root/principle** (宗) and **lord/master** (君), why should he not be able to know or practice?
Thus, the **sage** (圣人) says: *If you practice my Dao/Way, you should know the **Supreme Wisdom** (上慧), for wisdom is not born alone—it arises through causes and conditions*.
If one lacks the **hosting roots** (行宿本) of practice, this is called *no knowledge*—how could he ever clarify the **Supreme Dao’s** (太上) profound and mysterious principles?
This is why few know me.
There are those who know without being told—seeing what others do not perceive—and those who obtain without study—seeing what others do not recognize.
Thus, those who know the Dao/Way are rare, proving that those who truly perceive are precious.
Hence, the **sage** (圣人) is slighted in outward appearance yet profound within, not flaunting himself before others, holding **Kunshan jade** (昆山之玉) yet few can recognize it.

**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**
Knowing the unknown is praiseworthy;
Not knowing the known is a flaw.
It is only because of this flaw that one avoids it.
The **sage’s** (圣人) avoidance of flaws is because he recognizes them as flaws—thus he avoids them.
The Dao/Way is inherently beyond knowledge; yet through **no thought and no deliberation**, one knows it—thus it is called *knowing the unknown*, which is true knowledge.
One who knows the knowledge of *knowing the unknown* is indeed praiseworthy.
Not knowing the Dao/Way of *knowing the unknown*, yet claiming knowledge through lofty discourse and subtle theories, exhaustively probing roots and origins—his knowledge is flawed.
Only one who knows that *knowing the known as a flaw* is itself a flaw, and thus forgets his knowledge—this is why he avoids flaws.
How does the **sage** (圣人) never fall into flaws?
Because he knows that *knowing the known as a flaw* is itself a flaw, yet always acts as if he does not know—thus he avoids flaws.
The people do not fear great threats—

**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Great Threats**
The people do not fear great threats—then the greatest threat has truly arrived.
Do not confine their dwellings, do not weary of their birth.
It is only because of *not wearying* that one does not weary.
Thus, the **sage** (圣人) knows himself yet does not reveal himself, loves himself yet does not exalt himself—hence he discards that and takes this.

Anger and threats—its threat is small;
No anger yet threats—its threat is great.
The **sage** (圣人) does not bend the world with threats, making the people fear threats in appearance yet hold reverence for **virtue/power** (德) in their hearts.
Thus, the silent threat of *not angering* is the greatest threat that arrives.
Transforming the people to fulfill their nature—expanding and nourishing them, their dwellings are never confined;
Cultivating and completing them, their birth is never wearying—this is how the **sage** (圣人) embodies the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth** (天地道).

Embodying Heaven’s great threat yet not angering,
Embodying Earth’s broad dwelling yet not confining,
Embodying the Dao/Way’s eternal generation yet not wearying.
Only the **Supreme Sage** (上) does not weary of what the people produce—then the people also obtain fulfillment of their nature without wearying.
Thus, the **sage** (圣人) does not reveal himself—hence he is bright.
Only through brightness does one know oneself and embody Heaven and Earth.
He does not exalt himself—hence he is **virtuous/powerful** (德).
Only through **virtue/power** (德) does one love oneself and follow the Great Dao/Way—
Thus, he discards self-revelation and self-exaltation, taking instead the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth** (天地道).

**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring Brings Death**
Boldness in daring brings death;
Boldness in not daring brings life.
These two outcomes—one beneficial, one harmful—
What does Heaven abhor? Who knows its reason?
Thus, the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult.
The Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend yet conquers well,
Does not speak yet responds well,
Does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
Is unassuming yet plans well.
The Heavenly net is vast and wide, sparse yet never misses.

Boldness in daring and placing oneself before the world—this is called *contrary to Heaven’s Dao/Way*—thus death.
Boldness in not daring and not placing oneself before the world—this is called *embodying Heaven’s Dao/Way*—thus life.
Yet boldness in not daring is beneficial to life yet harmful to worldly customs,
Boldness in daring is beneficial to worldly customs yet harmful to life—
In the eyes of the world, one cannot escape doubt, hence they are confused.
What does Heaven abhor? Who can truly know its reason?
Moreover, Heaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess yet benefits humility—
Thus, those who follow Heaven endure, while those who oppose it perish—
Hence, the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult and does not dare to act.
Heaven’s Dao/Way has no purpose—
All things emerging, it emerges with them without refusal;
All things returning, it returns with them without rejection—
All things receive their mandate from this, hence it is called *not contending yet conquering well*.

The four seasons proceed in their course, and all things are born—
Indeed, it does not speak yet responds well.

The good are blessed by it, the licentious are doomed by it—
Indeed, it does not summon yet comes naturally.

It shows humanity what is easily known,
Yet responds to all things with manifold changes—
Indeed, it is straightforward yet well-planned.

The Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,
Though sparse, it does not lose its prey—
Is this not its way?

**The People Do Not Long Fear Punishment (Chapter 74)**
The people do not long fear death—
How can one terrify them with death?

If the people were to always fear death,
And yet someone dared to act strangely,
I could seize and execute them—
Who would dare?

There are always those charged with execution who execute.
He who substitutes for those charged with execution and executes,
Is like one who substitutes for the great carpenter and chops.

He who substitutes for the great carpenter and chops,
Few would escape unharmed.

If the people retain their nature,
They will always find joy in their lives;
If they lose their nature,
What fear is there in death?

Even if harsh laws are imposed to terrify them with death,
The people will resist and ultimately cannot be reformed.

If the people always fear death,
It means the governance allows them to retain their nature and know the joy of life,
Hence, they will not dare to commit serious crimes.

If there are those who act strangely,
I could seize and execute them—
Who would dare to act so?

There are always those charged with execution who execute,
This is called *virtue/power* (德) in governing with contracts.

If the people always fear death,
And yet someone dared to act strangely,
I could seize and execute them—
This is called *lacking virtue/power* (无德) in governing with contracts.

The people do not long fear death,
Yet one tries to terrify them with death—
Is this not like substituting for the great carpenter?

The great carpenter who chops all things,
Is the master of creation.

The master of creation,
Follows Heaven’s Dao/Way of *non-action* (无为).

Those who go against Heaven and control creation,
Are those of *action* (有为)—
Few would escape self-harm.

**The People’s Hunger (Chapter 75)**
The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taxing them too heavily—
Thus, they hunger.

The people are hard to govern because their rulers act—
Thus, they are hard to govern.

The people grow careless about death because their rulers provide them with abundant life—
Thus, they grow careless about death.

Only those who do not exploit life’s provisions,
Are wiser than those who cherish life.

The king regards the people as Heaven,
And the people regard food as Heaven.

The **sage**’s governance reduces punishments,
Lightens taxes and levies,
Knowing Heaven’s Heaven,
Then the people can be preserved.

The abundance of taxes arises from heavy burdens,
Yet the rulers do not know to lighten taxes and levies to nourish the people—
Thus, the people’s hunger.

The rulers’ *action* (有为) arises from their troublesome governance,
Yet they do not know to reduce punishments and levies to bring peace—
Thus, the people’s difficulty in being governed.

In general, human nature thrives in wealth and prosperity,
Then steadfastness arises;
Returns to simplicity and purity,
Then other desires vanish.

As for hunger and difficulty in governance,
They do not secure their proper share,
Yet their desire for profit grows ever more insistent—
Thus, some are driven to excess in life and into the realm of death,
Hence, the people’s carelessness about death.

Only those who grasp the Dao,
Guard within a single measure yet *qi* (氣) harmonizes naturally,
Their essence undiminished yet Heaven’s protection is complete.

Such people understand the nature of life,
Do not pursue what cannot be done by *action* (有为),
Are wiser than those who cherish life,
And differ from those who exploit life’s abundance and grow careless about death.

**The Nature of Human Life (Chapter 76)**
Humanity’s living is soft and weak,
Yet its dying is firm and strong.

Grasses and trees in their living are soft and brittle,
Yet in their dying, they wither and decay.

Thus, firm and strong are the companions of death,
Soft and weak are the companions of life.

Hence, strong armies do not conquer,
Strong wood is easily broken.

Thus, firm and strong must dwell below,
Soft and weak must be above.

Humanity’s living,
Bones are weak, sinews are soft,
Yet in dying,
Sinews and bones grow firm and strong.

Grasses and trees in their living,
Bark is brittle, branches are soft,
Yet in dying,
Branches and leaves wither and decay.

Thus, firm and strong are the companions of death,
Soft and weak are the companions of life—
This is the natural order.

Strong armies do not conquer,
Nor does strong wood endure—
This aligns with the same principle.

Firm and strong are companions of death,
Thus, they dwell below.

Soft and weak are companions of life,
Thus, they are above.

This is also the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth that ought to be so.

**Heaven’s Dao/Way (Chapter 77)**
Heaven’s Dao/Way is like drawing a bow—
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.

Heaven’s Dao/Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,
Yet humanity’s Dao/Way is not so—
They diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.

Who can diminish the excessive to serve the deficient in the world?
Only the Dao.

Thus, the **sage** acts yet does not rely on it,
Completes the task yet does not claim it—
This is why they do not seek to display their virtue/power.

Heaven’s Dao/Way attains perfection through moderation,
Without excess or deficiency.

Is it not like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, so they do not have excess—
Thus, the excessive are diminished.
The low are raised, so they do not lack—
Thus, the deficient are supplemented.

Heaven’s Dao/Way reduces fullness and excess,
Supplements emptiness and void,
Destroys strength and vigor,
Benefits decay and weakness—
Yet humanity’s Dao/Way is entirely contrary to this,
Diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.

Those who can serve the world with the Dao of excess,
Only Heaven’s Dao/Way does so.

The **sage** embodies the Dao,
Thus, they act yet do not rely on it,
Complete the task yet do not claim it—
They never use their strengths to display themselves to others,
Hence, they are always without harm,
This is how the **sage** can align with Heaven.

**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78)**
In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,
Yet in attacking firm and strong things, nothing can surpass it,
Because there is nothing to replace it.

The gentle overcome the rigid,
The weak overcome the strong—
All in the world know this,
Yet none can practice it.

Thus, the **sage** says:
To bear the filth of the state,
This is the duty of the lord of the soil and grain;
To bear the misfortunes of the state,
This is the duty of the king of the world.

Straightforward words as if reversed.

In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water,
Yet it can attack firm and strong things—
Nothing can overcome it,
Because it has constancy and nothing can replace it,
Thus, it approaches the Dao.

**The Gentle and Weak in the World (Chapter 78, continued)**
The gentle overcome the rigid,
The weak overcome the strong—
Yet all in the world know this,
And none can practice it.
Why so?
Because they increase life,
And because their hearts command their **qi**,
Thus they lose the **Dao** of gentle and weak.

Now, what is gentle and weak yet constant,
And nothing can replace it?
Only the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth.
The **Dao** of Earth:
Bears the filth of the state,
And does not transform itself—
Yet it transforms all else,
Thus it is called the lord of the soil and grain.
Is this not what is meant by
*The gentle overcoming the rigid?*

The **Dao** of Heaven:
Bears the misfortunes of the state,
And does not generate itself—
Yet it generates all else,
Thus it is called the king of the world.
Is this not what is meant by
*The weak overcoming the strong?*

That which is straightforward yet seems reversed—
Bearing the filth of the state and its misfortunes.
With straightforward words,
It seems reversed indeed.

**Harmonizing Great Grievances (Chapter 79)**
Harmonizing great grievances,
Must leave some lingering resentment—
How can this be called good?
Thus, the **sage** holds the left half of the contract,
And does not demand repayment from others.

Therefore, one with **virtue** governs the contract,
One without **virtue** governs the final settlement.
The **Dao** of Heaven has no favorites,
It always aligns with those of virtue.

Yang is **virtue**—
It does nothing.
Yin is resentment—
It does much.

In the world, people act boldly in daring to do,
Thus they have resentment.
Adding wisdom, kindness, and righteousness to harmonize great grievances,
Only makes resentment more abundant.

If this is so,
How can it be called good?

Moreover, wisdom and kindness are external,
Righteousness and propriety bring many demands—
Thus bold action leads to more resentment.

Therefore, the **sage** follows Heaven’s course,
Dwelling in non-action,
Practicing speechless teaching,
Giving to others yet never taking—
Thus they do not demand repayment,
And resentment has no place.

This is called the **virtue** of the **sage** above—
To bear resentment with **virtue**,
Thus it is said: *One with **virtue** governs the contract.*

This is called the **virtue** of the **sage** below—
To act boldly yet harmonize resentment,
Thus it is said: *One without **virtue** governs the final settlement.*

The **Dao** of Heaven—
This is the **virtue** of the **sage** above—
No partiality, no bias,
Only those who act in non-action
Are always favored by Heaven.

**The Small State and Few People (Chapter 80)**
A small state with few people,
Lets the people have tenfold and hundredfold tools,
Yet does not use them;
Lets the people value death,
Yet does not flee their homeland.

Though there are boats and carriages,
They have no place to ride them;
Though there are arms and armor,
They have no place to display them;
They return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.

They delight in their food,
Adorn their clothing,
Find peace in their customs,
Take joy in their livelihoods.

Neighboring states are visible,
The sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—
Yet they do not visit one another,
Until they die of old age without meeting.

Nine corners, eight districts,
Sheltered within a small state.
In the age of supreme **virtue**,
The land is not expanded,
The people are not multiplied—
Yet they can make one state like a family,
One family like a single body.

I love stillness,
And the people naturally align.
Though wise men may lead in front,
And clever ones may confuse behind,
The people bear no burden of scheming—
Thus they are allowed to have tenfold and hundredfold tools,
Yet do not use them.

In such times,
The people all take joy in life,
Find comfort in their native soil,
Guard their own state—
Thus they value death,
Yet do not flee their homeland.
Because they do not flee,
There are no dangers of rivers and roads—
Though there are boats and carriages,
They have no place to ride them;
No calamities of war—
Though there are arms and armor,
They have no place to display them.

Great trust requires no oaths—
What need for written contracts?
Thus they return to using knotted cords.

Therefore, they diligently till the fields,
And find their food sweet;
They personally tend the mulberry trees,
And find their clothing fine;
They cherish their homeland,
And find their dwelling secure;
They preserve life,
And find their customs joyful.

Though their dwellings are close,
And their voices are heard,
They do not visit one another—
No desires, no demands—
They act without pretense,
Yet all things naturally unfold.
This is called supreme **virtue**.

**The Sage’s Speech is Not Ornate (Chapter 81)**
The **sage’s** words are not ornate,
Ornate words are not **sage**.
The good do not argue,
The argumentative are not good.
The wise do not display vast knowledge,
The learned are not truly wise.

The **sage** has no accumulation—
The more they give to others,
The more they possess;
The more they share with others,
The more they have.

The **Dao** of Heaven:
Benefits without harming.
The **Dao** of the **sage**:
Acts without competing.

The **sage’s** words are few—
When they speak,
Their words are simple, without taste—
Thus they are not ornate.

Ornate words are mere appearances—
When they deal with others,
Light promises bring few trustworthy deeds—
Thus they are not trusted.

The **Dao** of Heaven does not speak,
Yet always responds with goodness—
Thus the good do not argue.

Harmonizing great grievances—
How can this be called good?
Thus the argumentative are not good.

Those who know the **Dao** must reach the **principle**—
Reaching the **principle** means they will use reverse speech to govern.
Thus the wise do not display vast knowledge.

Knowledge that is too broad confuses the mind—
The more one hears and sees,
The less they can grasp the essential—
Thus the learned are not truly wise.

Not ornate,
Not argumentative,
Not vast in knowledge—
This is called *having nothing to dwell upon within oneself.*

The **Dao** of the **sage** is to have nothing to dwell upon within oneself—
Thus they move without accumulation,
And the **sage** has no accumulation.
Because of accumulation, they are insufficient;
Because of no hoarding, they have abundance.

The **sage** has no accumulation—
Thus they can use the **Dao** of abundance
To nourish the world.
All under Heaven come to depend on them,
Yet they are never exhausted—
Thus the more they give to others,
The more they possess;
The more they share with others,
The more they have.

The **Dao** of the **sage** is the **Dao** of Heaven—
The **Dao** of Heaven benefits without harming,
Thus the **Dao** of the **sage** acts without competing.

Moreover, Heaven uses beauty and benefit
To benefit the world—
What harm could there be?
The **sage** emerges from non-action,
Yet does not disrupt Heaven’s natural order,
Nor go against the inclinations of things—
Again, what is there to compete over?

This is the *De Jing* speaking,
And its words conclude here—
Because **virtue** encompasses the **Dao**,
And the **Dao** encompasses Heaven.
If one does not understand Heaven,
They will not grasp the **sage**—
Thus the *Mixed Primordium* ends here.

The ancient **sages** revealed their teachings through the **Dao**,
And demonstrated the **Dao** through their words.
The **Dao** is formless,
Mysterious and unfathomable—
Yet if they do not rely on words,
How could the **Dao** be made clear?

If words do not fully express meaning,
Then they must be written down—
Their language is subtle and profound,
Difficult to recognize—
Subtle and profound,
Difficult to recognize,
Scholars cannot know its root.

The *De Jing* concludes its second scroll—
**#1** If clumsy: doubt arises as *"If bent"*[^1].

[^1]: *Note: "若拙" (ruò zhuō) is ambiguous; "若屈" (ruò qū) would mean "if bent," but "若拙" (ruò zhuō) more likely refers to "if unrefined" or "if crude."*
