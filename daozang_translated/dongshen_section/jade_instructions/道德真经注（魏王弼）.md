**Volume One of the *Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***
By Wang Bi of Shanyang (山陽王弼)

**Chapter 1**
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.
What can be spoken of as the Dao and named as the Name
are but conventional designations—shapes imposed upon things—
and thus are not the eternal Dao and eternal Name.
Hence, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is the eternal Dao,
and the Name that cannot be named is the eternal Name.

The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
All things arise from the Nameless—
thus, in its formless, nameless state, it is the origin of all things.
When it takes form and receives a name,
it nurtures and sustains them, fosters and protects them—
thus it is their mother.
The Dao, though formless and nameless,
gives rise to all things and brings them to completion,
yet its workings remain unfathomable—
the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.
Therefore, one must remain without desire
to perceive its subtlety.
For subtlety is the extreme of the minute—
all things begin in the minute and then take form,
begin in the void and then come to life.
Thus, by remaining without desire and emptiness,
one may perceive the subtlety of things in their origin.

One must also cultivate desire
to perceive their limits.
"Limits" refers to their return to the end.
All that exists relies on the nonexistent for its function;
desire’s origin lies in aligning with the Dao to achieve fulfillment.
Thus, by cultivating desire,
one may perceive the limits of things in their conclusion.

These two—origin and mother—
emerge from the same source yet bear different names.
They are called the Mysterious,
the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,
the gateway to all subtleties.
The two—origin and mother—
share a single source.
They emerge from the same Mysterious,
yet their applications differ—
at the beginning, it is called origin;
at the end, it is called mother.
The Mysterious is the obscure,
the silent void—
the source of origin and mother,
yet it cannot be named or spoken of.
It is called the Mysterious because it cannot be grasped,
yet to say it is the Mysterious is not to fix it as a single entity—
for then the name would fail to encompass it.
Hence, it is the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious.
All subtleties arise from this unity,
thus it is called the gateway to all subtleties.

**Chapter 2**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
then ugliness already exists;
When all know goodness as goodness,
then evil already exists.
Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
difficulty and ease complete each other,
long and short define each other,
high and low depend on each other,
sound and voice harmonize,
before and after follow in sequence.

Beauty is what the heart delights in;
ugliness is what the heart abhors.
Beauty and ugliness are like joy and anger;
goodness and evil are like right and wrong.
Joy and anger share the same root;
right and wrong share the same gate—
thus they cannot be exhaustively categorized.

These six pairs
are all manifestations of the self-evident principles of Nature,
which cannot be fully enumerated.

Therefore, the Sage acts without action,
yet Nature suffices—
action would only bring ruin.
He teaches without words.
All things arise from it, yet he does not claim them;
he gives life yet does not possess;
he acts yet does not rely on his deeds—
wisdom is inherent, yet to act would be deceit.
When the work is complete, he does not dwell upon it.
He follows things in their natural use—
the work is accomplished by them, so he does not claim it.
Thus, by not dwelling upon it,
it cannot be taken from him.
If he were to claim the work as his own,
it could not endure.

---

**Chapter 3**
Do not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend;
Do not prize difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;
Do not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become confused.

"Worthy" means "able."
"Exalt" is the name given to praise.
"Prize" is the term for elevation.
If only ability is entrusted, why praise?
If only utility is applied, why elevate?
To exalt the worthy is to display their name,
to honor them beyond their capacity,
leading to constant competition and rivalry.
To prize goods beyond their use
spurs the greedy to vie for them,
driving them to break and enter, to risk life in theft.
Thus, if desirable things are not displayed,
the heart will not be disturbed.

Therefore, the Sage’s governance
empties the mind, fills the belly—
the mind holds wisdom, the belly holds food;
emptiness contains wisdom, fullness lacks knowledge.
He weakens the will, strengthens the bones.
The bones act without knowledge;
the will generates affairs and brings confusion.
He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,
preserving their true nature,
so that even the wise dare not act.
"The wise" refers to those who act with knowledge.
To act without action is to govern without failure.

**Chapter 4**

「The Dao/Way is vast yet applied, yet sometimes not filled to the brim,
profound as though the origin of all things.
Blunt its sharpness, untangle its confusion,
harmonize its radiance, align with its dust—
serene as though eternally preserved.

I do not know whose child it is,
yet it precedes the Sovereign of Heaven.
He who clings to a single household’s measure
cannot fulfill the household;
he who clings to a single kingdom’s measure
cannot perfect the kingdom;
exhausting strength to lift the heavy
cannot serve as true utility.

Thus, though a man may know all things are governed,
if he governs not by the Dao/Way of the two principles (yin-yang),
he cannot sustain them.

The Earth, though vast in form,
if it does not conform to Heaven,
cannot maintain its eternal tranquility;
Heaven, though refined in essence,
if it does not conform to the Dao/Way,
cannot preserve its purity.

Vast yet applied, its use cannot be exhausted;
full yet creating substance, substance comes and overflows.
Thus, vast yet applied, it again does not brim—
its boundless nature is already consummate.

Though form may be great,
it cannot burden its substance;
though matters may be urgent,
they cannot fill its measure.

All things abandon this to seek a master—
where is this master’s refuge?

Is it not profound as though the origin of all things?

Blunted yet unharmed, untangled yet unwearied,
harmonized light yet unstained—
its essence aligned with dust yet unchanging in truth,
is it not serene as though eternally preserved?

The Earth upholds its form,
yet its virtue/power cannot exceed its capacity to sustain;
Heaven embraces its essence,
yet its virtue/power cannot exceed its coverage.

Heaven and Earth cannot surpass it—
is it not like the Sovereign of Heaven’s precursor?
Heaven’s Sovereign, the celestial ruler.

**Chapter 5**

Heaven and Earth are not kind,
treating all things as fodder for sacrifice.
Heaven and Earth follow Nature,
acting without contrivance or creation,
letting all things govern themselves—
thus, they are not kind.

The kind must contrive and establish,
bestowing transformations with favor and action.
To contrive and establish, transformations—
things lose their true nature;
to bestow with favor and action—
things cannot fully exist;
things cannot fully exist,
and thus cannot suffice to fill their purpose.

The Earth does not grow fodder for beasts so that beasts eat fodder,
nor does it breed dogs for men so that men eat dogs.
It acts without contrivance toward all things,
yet all things find their proper use—
none are left unsustained.

If wisdom arises from self-assertion,
it is insufficient for reliance.

The Sage is not kind,
treating the people as fodder for sacrifice.
The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue/power,
comparing the people to fodder for sacrifice.

Between Heaven and Earth—
is it not like the *huangqiú*?
Empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.

*Huang* is the bellows of *qiú*,
*Qiú* is the reed of *huang*:
Within the hollow of the *huangqiú*,
there is no sentiment, no contrivance—
thus, empty yet not exhausted or bent,
moving yet never depleted.

Between Heaven and Earth,
it resonates with Nature—
thus, it cannot be exhausted,
like the *huangqiú*.

Much speech leads to exhaustion;
better to hold the center.
The more one acts,
the more one loses.

To plant evil in things,
to entangle matters with words—
is not this the path to ruin?

If one holds the *huangqiú* and adheres to the center,
there is no exhaustion;
if one abandons self to follow things,
all will be in harmony.

If the *huangqiú* intends to produce sound,
it cannot suffice for the demands of those who blow it.

**Chapter 6**

The *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit) does not die,
this is called the *Xuānmǔ* (Dark Mother).
The *Xuānmǔ*’s gate,
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Enduring as though it exists,
its use is tireless.

The *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit),
the center of the valley with no valley—
formless, shadowless,
without obstruction or resistance,
dwelling low yet unmoving,
guarding stillness without decay—
the valley is formed by it yet its form is unseen,
this is the supreme thing.

Dwelling low yet nameless,
thus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth—
enduring as though it exists,
its use is tireless.

The gate,
the means by which the *Xuānmǔ* is accessed—
rooted in its origin,
it shares the same essence as the utmost,
thus it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

To say it exists is to speak of evil,
to say it does not exist—
all things arise from it,
thus it endures as though it exists.

Nothing fails to be formed,
its use is effortless—
thus it is said: "Its use is tireless."

**Chapter 7**

Heaven endures, Earth persists,
Heaven and Earth endure long—
because they do not generate themselves.
If they generate themselves,
they would contend with things;
if they do not generate themselves,
things return to them.
Thus they can endure eternally.

Therefore, the Sage places his body last,
yet his body is first;
he sets his body aside,
yet his body is preserved.

Is it not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he can fulfill his selfishness.

The one without selfishness,
acts without contrivance toward his body.
His body first, his body preserved—
thus it is said: "He can fulfill his selfishness."

**Chapter 8**

The highest excellence is like water.
Water excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend,
dwelling where people revile—
people revile what is low.
Thus it approaches the Dao/Way.

The Dao/Way has no excellence like water,
thus it is said: "approaches."

Residing in the finest land,
the heart in the most profound depths,
being in harmony with goodness,
speaking in trust,
acting in rectitude,
doing in capability,
moving in timely fashion—

Only because it does not contend,
therefore it has no grievance.
These words all respond to the governance of the Dao/Way.

**Chapter 9**

To grasp and fill—
it is not as good as letting it be.
"To grasp" means not to lose virtue/power.
If one does not lose virtue/power yet fills it,
the situation will inevitably become precarious.

Thus, it is not as good as letting it be—
meaning it is even worse than having no virtue/power or achievement.

To sharpen and refine—
it cannot be long preserved.
If one already blunts the edge to make it dull,
yet sharpens it to make it keen,
the situation will inevitably become shattered—
thus it cannot be long preserved.

Gold and jade fill the hall,
yet none can guard them—
not as good as letting them be.

In prosperity yet arrogant,
one invites ruin upon oneself—
cannot be long preserved.

When success is achieved, withdraw—
the Way of Heaven.
The four seasons follow their course,
success achieved, then it moves.

**Chapter 10**

To sustain the *Yíngpò* (vital breath and corporeal form),
to embrace the One—
can it not remain undivided?
"To sustain" means to dwell.
The *Yíngpò* is where man commonly resides.
The One is man’s true nature.

Speaking of one who can dwell in the ordinary abode of man,
embracing the One with a clear spirit.»

「能常无离乎，则万物自宾也。
If one can remain perpetually undivided, then all things will come of their own accord.

专气致柔，能婴儿乎？
Can one focus the *qi* to achieve supreme softness, like an infant?
专，任也。
*Focus* means to follow naturally.
致，极也。
*Achieve* means to reach the utmost.
言任自然之气，致至柔之和。
Speaking of one who follows the *qi* of nature, reaching the harmony of supreme softness.
能若婴儿之无所欲乎，则物全而性得矣。
If one can be like an infant with no desires, then all things will be complete and one’s true nature will be attained.

涤除玄览，能无疵乎？
Can one purify and remove all obstructions to attain *玄览* (mystic vision), without blemish?
玄，物之极也。
*玄* (mystic) is the utmost of things.
言能涤除邪饰，至於极览，能不以物介其明。
Speaking of one who can purify and remove all false adornments, reaching the utmost of mystic vision, without letting things obstruct their clarity.
疵其神#3乎，则终与玄同也。
If one does not blemish their spirit#3, then they will ultimately merge with the mystic.

爱民治国，能无知乎？
Can one govern the people and the state without relying on *知* (knowledge/awareness)?
任术以求成，运数以求匿者，智也。
To employ techniques in pursuit of success, or to manipulate circumstances to achieve concealment, is *智* (cunning/worldly wisdom).
玄览无疵，犹绝圣也。
To attain mystic vision without blemish is akin to *绝圣* (transcending the worldly sage).
治国无以智，犹弃智也。
To govern the state without relying on cunning wisdom is to abandon cunning wisdom.
能无以智乎，则民不辟而国治之也。
If one can abandon cunning wisdom, then the people will not be alienated and the state will be well-ordered.

天门开阖，能为雌乎？
Can one open and close the *天门* (Heavenly Gate), like a receptive female?
天门，谓天下之所由从也。
The *天门* (Heavenly Gate) is the means through which the affairs of the world proceed.
开阖，治乱之际也。
Opening and closing are the junctures of order and chaos.
或开或阖，经通於天下，故曰天门开阖也。
Sometimes it opens, sometimes it closes, flowing through the world like the *Dao* (Way), hence the saying "Heavenly Gate opens and closes."
雌应而不昌，因而不为。
A receptive female responds without dominating, and acts without contriving.
言天门开阖，能为雌乎，则物自宾而处自安矣。
Speaking of one who can open and close the Heavenly Gate like a receptive female, then all things will come of their own accord and one’s dwelling will be secure.

明白四达，能无知乎？
Can one be clear and all-pervading without relying on *知* (knowledge/awareness)?
言至明四达，无迷无惑，能无以为乎，则物化矣。
Speaking of one who reaches utmost clarity and all-pervasiveness, without confusion or doubt, and acts without contriving, then all things will transform naturally.

所谓道常无为，侯王 若能守，则万物自化。
This is the saying: The *Dao* (Way) is ever without action.
If lords and kings can uphold it, then all things will transform naturally.

生之，不塞其原也。」
To nurture them, without blocking their source.

---

**Nurture them. To restrain not their nature.**

To give birth without possessing,
To act without relying upon,
To grow without dominating—
This is called *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power).

To not block their source, then things will generate of themselves—
What labor would there be?
To not restrain their nature, then things will prosper on their own—
What need to contrive?

Things grow and mature without my domination,
With virtue yet no master—
How could this be anything but *Xuan* (Mysterious)?

All who speak of *Xuan De* (Mysterious Virtue/Power)
Have virtue yet do not know its source—
Emerging from the depths of obscurity.

**Chapter Eleven:**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
Yet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives the cart its use.
The hub’s power to govern the thirty spokes
Lies in its *wu* (emptiness).
Because of its *wu*, it can receive all things—
Thus it can truly govern the many.

Clay is shaped into vessels,
Yet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives them use.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms,
Yet it is their *wu* (emptiness) that gives them use.
Thus, having gives profit,
But *wu* (emptiness) gives use.

Wood and clay walls form these three,
Yet all rely on *wu* (emptiness) for their function.
Speaking of *wu* (emptiness),
It is the means by which having yields profit,
And all things derive their use.

**Chapter Twelve:**
Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deafen the ears,
Five flavors dull the palate,
Excessive hunting drives the mind to madness.
*Cuan* (dullness)—this is the loss of taste,
Thus it is called *cuan*.

The ears, eyes, mouth, and heart all follow their nature—
Yet instead of aligning with *nature*, they harm it,
Hence *blindness, deafness, dullness, madness*.

Rare treasures obstruct the path,
Rare treasures block the right way—
Thus they cause obstruction in conduct.

Therefore, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—
Thus he discards the latter for the former.
To nourish the belly is to use things to sustain oneself.
To nourish the eyes is to use things to enslave oneself—
Thus the sage does not nourish the eyes.

**Chapter Thirteen:**
Honor and disgrace—both bring alarm.
Great calamity is treated as one’s own body.

What is meant by *honor and disgrace bringing alarm*?
Honor is lowly—
To gain it brings alarm,
To lose it brings alarm—
This is called *honor and disgrace bringing alarm*.

Honor must bring disgrace,
Glory must bring calamity—
Alarm at disgrace equals alarm at glory,
For honor and calamity are the same.

If one in low station treats honor, disgrace, glory, and calamity as alarming,
Then one cannot disrupt the world.

What is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?
Great calamity belongs to the realm of honor and glory.
Thick life leads only to deeper death—
Thus it is called *great calamity*.

People are deluded by honor and glory,
Yet return to treating it as their own body—
Thus it is called *great calamity as one’s own body*.

The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have a body.
Because of having a body,
When I have no body,
I return to *nature*.

What calamity then remains?
Thus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure—
As if one could entrust the world to it—
To not exchange it for anything—
This is called *treasure*.

Thus, one can entrust the world to it.
To love the body as the world’s treasure—
As if one could entrust the world to it—
With nothing to diminish it—
This is called *love*.

Thus, one can entrust the world to it.
Only when one does not let honor, disgrace, glory, or calamity
Diminish or exchange the body,
Can one then truly entrust the world to it.

**Chapter Fourteen:**
Seen yet not seen—called *Yi* (Smooth).
Heard yet not heard—called *Xi* (Subtle).
Grasped yet not obtained—called *Wei* (Fine).

These three cannot be pursued or questioned,
Thus they merge into one.
Formless, shapeless,
Voiceless, soundless—
Thus they can pervade everywhere,
Go anywhere.

Unknowable—
Further naming it with my ears, eyes, and body as *unknowable*—
Thus it cannot be pursued or questioned,
And merges into one.

Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower reaches are not dark.
Endless, nameless—
Returning to *wu* (nothingness).

This is called *the form of formlessness*,
*The image of imagelessness*.
Speaking of *wu* (nothingness)—
Yet things arise through it.
Speaking of *you* (having)—
Yet no shape is seen.
Thus it is called *the form of formlessness*,
*The image of imagelessness*.

This is called *Huo-Huang* (Vague and Indeterminate).
It cannot be fixed.

Approach it—you see no head,
Follow it—you see no tail.
Hold fast to the ancient *Dao* (Way)
To govern the present *you* (having).
*You*—this refers to concrete affairs.

To know the ancient beginnings—
This is called *Dao Ji* (the pattern of the *Dao*).

The formless, nameless—
The origin of all things.
Though past and present differ,
Times change, customs shift—
Yet none fail to follow this,
To achieve their governance.
Thus one can hold fast to the ancient *Dao*
To govern the present *you* (having).

Though ancient times are distant,
Their *Dao* remains—
Thus even in the present,
One can know the ancient beginnings.

**Chapter Fifteen:**
The ancients who excelled as scholars
Were subtle, mysterious, and penetrating—
Deep beyond recognition.

Because they were beyond recognition,
They feigned outward appearances:
*Yu* (reserved)—like winter crossing a river,
Winter’s crossing—hesitant, as if to cross or not,
A demeanor impossible to discern.

*You* (solemn)—like fearing surrounding neighbors,
Neighbors converging in attack,
The central lord yet unaware of his direction—
The virtuous person’s beginnings and tendencies are unseen,
Their inclinations invisible—
Also like this.

*Yan* (grave)—as if maintaining decorum,
*Huan* (dissolving)—like ice about to melt,
*Dun* (solid)—like uncarved wood,
*Kuang* (vast)—like a valley,
*Hun* (mixed)—like muddy water.

All these *ruo* (as if) descriptions
Speak of appearances and forms that cannot be named or shaped.

Who can make muddy water still and gradually clear?
Who can make settled things move and gradually generate life?
To obscure in order to govern things yields clarity,
To muddy in order to still things yields purity,
To settle in order to move things yields life—
This is the *Dao* of *nature*.

*Who can*—speaking of its difficulty.
*Xu* (gradually)—speaking of careful deliberation.

Those who preserve this *Dao*
Do not desire fullness.
Fullness must overflow.
Only by not being full
Can one avoid being newly formed.

*Ao* (cover)—to envelop.
---
**Chapter Sixteen:**

**Chapter Seventeen:**

Attain the utmost emptiness,
Preserve stillness with sincerity.
This means to bring things to their emptiest state
And steadfastly uphold their truest stillness.

When all things arise together,
Moving and growing in action,
I observe their return.
With emptiness and stillness, I watch their reversals.

All that arises from emptiness,
All motion from stillness—
Thus, though all things move and act in concert,
They ultimately return to emptiness and stillness,
This is the most sincere nature of things.

Things, myriad and diverse,
Each return to their root.
Each revert to their origin.

Returning to the root is stillness—
This is called *recovering the vital breath* (*fùmìng*).
Recovering the vital breath is constancy—
Returning to the root is stillness, hence *stillness*.
Stillness brings recovery of the vital breath, hence *recovering the vital breath*.
Recovering the vital breath attains the constancy of life and vitality, hence *constancy*.

Knowing constancy is clarity.
Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and disaster.

Constancy, as a principle,
Is neither partial nor exaggerated,
Lacks the states of bright or dim,
Nor the forms of warmth or cold—
Thus, knowing constancy is clarity.

Only this return can embrace and harmonize all things,
Without exclusion.
Losing this, evil invades its proper place,
And things stray from their nature—
Thus, not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and disaster.

Knowing constancy is to embrace all,
Without exclusion.
Embrace is universality—
To embrace all without exclusion is to attain boundless fairness.
Fairness is sovereignty—
Boundless fairness is to encompass all without fail.
Sovereignty is heaven—
To encompass all without fail is to align with heaven.
Heaven is the Dao—
To harmonize with heaven in virtue,
To embody the Dao in vast unity,
Is to attain the utmost emptiness.

The Dao endures—
To exhaust emptiness and attain the Dao’s constancy
Is to reach the boundless.
Thus, one’s life is secure, without peril.

Emptiness, as a state,
Cannot be harmed by fire or water,
Cannot be damaged by metal or stone.
Applied to the mind,
Tigers and rhinoceroses cannot find purchase for their claws and horns,
Weapons cannot find room for their blades—
What danger or peril could there be?

The Supreme Sage
Acts below while knowing existence;

The Supreme Sage—
This refers to the Great Person.
The Great Person is above, hence called the Supreme Sage.
The Great Person, being above,
Resides in *wuwei* (non-action),
Practices *buyan* (non-teaching),
All things arise yet he does not initiate them—
Thus, those below know of his existence alone.

The next rank, he is loved and praised—
Unable to dwell in *wuwei* or teach through *buyan*,
He establishes virtuous deeds and benevolent actions,
So that those below come to love and praise him.

The next rank, he is feared—
Unable to further rely on virtue and kindness,
He governs through reliance on authority and power.

The next rank, he is scorned—
Unable to govern by law and order,
Those below know to avoid him,
His commands are not obeyed—
Thus, he is scorned.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises.
This is spoken from above.
When the body’s nature is lost, sickness arises;
When things are not aided in their true form, flaws and strife emerge.
When trust is insufficient, distrust arises—
This is the natural way.
One’s own inadequacy cannot be remedied by cleverness.
Ah, how precious is speech!
When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The people all say, *"It was as if by nature."*
Nature’s beginnings are unseen,
Its intentions imperceptible.
No thing can replace his words—
Words must have response—
Thus, *"Ah, how precious is speech!"*

Residing in *wuwei*,
Practicing *buyan*,
Not shaping things through form,
Thus, when deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,
The people do not know how it came to be.

**Chapter Eighteen**
When the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises *ren* and *yi* (benevolence and righteousness);
When *wuwei* is lost, cleverness is employed,
And virtuous paths are established to guide things.
When wisdom emerges, great deceit arises;
When methods are applied and clarity used,
To detect deceit and falsehood.
When intentions are visible and forms are seen,
Things know to avoid them.
Thus, when wisdom emerges, great deceit arises.

When familial bonds are fractured, there arises filial piety and tenderness;
When the state is in chaos, there arise loyal ministers.

「How wondrous is the name of *beauty*,
Born from the Great *Evil*—
This is what is meant by *"beauty and evil share the same gate."*

The Six Kinships: father and son, brothers, husband and wife.
If the Six Kinships are naturally harmonious,
And the state naturally governed,
Then filial piety, tenderness, loyal ministers, and virtuous subjects
Would not know where to appear.

Fish forget each other in the Dao of rivers and lakes,
And thus the *virtue* of mutual moistening arises.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Abandon the *saints* and discard wisdom,
And the people benefit a hundredfold;
Abandon *ren* and *yi* (benevolence and righteousness),
And the people return to filial piety and tenderness;
Abandon cleverness and profit,
And thieves and robbers vanish.

These three *virtues* are insufficient as mere *cultural refinement*,
Hence, they must be paired with their counterparts.
Seeing *unadorned simplicity* (素) and embracing *primordial purity* (抱朴),
Minimize selfishness and reduce desires.

The *saints* and wisdom—
The finest of *talent* (才);
*Ren* and *yi*—
The finest of *humanity* (人);
Cleverness and profit—
The finest of *utility* (用).

Yet to speak of mere *"abandonment"* is too stark a *cultural refinement*,
So one must pair them with their counterparts,
Linking them to *unadorned simplicity*, *primordial purity*, and few desires.

**Chapter Twenty**
Abandon learning, and there is no *worry*.」

「Chapter
　　How far apart are *"the affirming"* (唯) and *"the denying"* (阿)?
　　How distant are *virtue* (善) and *evil* (惡)?
　　What the people fear,
　　One must not fail to fear.

The lower portion benefits scholars by daily increase,
And benefits those who follow the *Dao/Way* by daily decrease.
Thus, learning seeks to augment what one can achieve to advance one’s *wisdom* (智).

If one were to attain contentment through *non-desire* (無欲), why seek further increase?
To know without knowing, why seek further advancement?
The *luán* (鸾) and *què* (雀) are matched in kind,
While the *jiū* (鸠) and *gē* (鸽) bear enmity.
Inhabitants of cold lands
Naturally know the warmth of *zhān qiú* (旃裘),
And find it sufficient—yet to add more would bring *worry* (忧).

Thus, to extend the *fú* duck’s foot,
What difference is there from amputating the *hè* crane’s shin?
To fear reputation and advance,
What difference is there from fearing punishment?

*"The affirming"* and *"the denying"* (唯阿), *virtue* and *evil* (美恶)—
How distant are they?

Thus, what the people fear,
I too fear—
Yet I dare not rely upon it for *utility* (用).

Vast and boundless!
I sigh at how distant this is from the common ways.

The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As though feasting on the *tài láo* (太牢) sacrificial banquet,
Or ascending the spring platform.
The multitude is deluded by the allure of advancement,
Confused by fame and gain,
Their hearts competing to progress,
Hence their bustling joy, like feasting on the *tài láo* or ascending the spring platform.

I alone stand in dread—
Yet no signs reveal themselves,
Like an infant before it can speak.
I say of my boundless formlessness, nameless and unmarked,
As an infant before it can utter words.

Frugal and frugal,
As though having nowhere to dwell.
As though having nowhere to rest.

The multitude all have excess—
Yet I alone seem abandoned.
The multitude all possess ambition and aspiration,
Their hearts overflowing with schemes,
Hence I say they all have excess.

I alone stand boundless,
Without action or desire,
As though lost.

Ah, my heart is that of a simpleton!
Severing the heart of the utterly simple,
There is no distinction or analysis,
No preference or craving.

Yet my true nature remains unseen—
Thus I am utterly undone.

Muddled and indistinct!
There is no distinction or analysis,
And it cannot be made clear.

The common folk are bright and discerning,
Their light dazzling.
I alone seem dim.

The common folk are keen and discriminating,
Yet I alone am dull and obscure.
Misty and deep,
My nature is unseen.
Swirling and endless,
Without tether or constraint.

The multitude all have means—
*Utility* (以) in use—
All seek to apply themselves.
Yet I alone seem coarse and base,
Without desire to act,
Dull and dim,
As though recognizing nothing,
Hence I say coarse and base.

I alone differ from others,
Yet hold *sì mǔ* (食母) dear.
*Sì mǔ* (食母) is the root of life.
Others all abandon the root of life for the people,
And prize the embellishments of superficial adornment,
Hence I say I alone desire to differ from others.

*Shānyáng* King Wang’s (山阳王) *Pì* (弼) annotations」

**Chapter 21**
The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.
*Kǒng* (孔) means "emptiness."
Only by taking emptiness as virtue can one then move and act in accordance with the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is but vague and indistinct—
Vague and indistinct, formless, beyond all attachment.
Fleeting and elusive, yet within it are forms;
Elusive and fleeting, yet within it are things.
It begins things with no form,
Completes things without attachment,
And all things begin and are completed,
Yet do not know how it is so.
Thus it is said: fleeting and elusive,
Elusive and fleeting, yet within it are forms.
Profound and dark, yet within it is essence—
Profound and dark, a sigh of the boundless depths.
The depths are unseen, yet all things arise from it.
What can be seen is but its fixed manifestation.
Thus it is said: profound and dark, yet within it is essence.
Its essence is most true, and within it is authenticity.
Authenticity means verifiable truth.
When things return to the profound and dark,
The utmost of true essence is attained,
And the nature of all things is fixed.
Thus it is said: its essence is most true, yet within it is authenticity.
From ancient times to today,
Its name does not fade—
The utmost of true essence cannot be named,
And the nameless is its true name.
From ancient times to today,
Nothing exists that does not arise from it.
Thus it is said: from ancient times to today, its name does not fade.
It governs all beginnings.
Beginnings are the origin of things.
It explains the origin of all things with the nameless.
How do I know the state of all beginnings?
By this—
This refers to what was said above.
Speaking of how I know that the origin of all things lies in the nameless,
It is known by this.

**Chapter 22**
What is bent becomes whole;
Not seeing oneself, its clarity is whole#1.
What is crooked becomes straight;
Not asserting oneself, its correctness is manifest.
What is hollow becomes full;
Not boasting, its merit is complete.
What is worn becomes new;
Not vaunting, its virtue endures.
Fewer desires bring attainment; many bring confusion.
The Way of Nature is like a tree—
The more branches it has, the farther from its root;
The fewer branches, the closer to its origin.
Many branches lead to confusion from its truth,
Hence it is said: confusion.
Fewer branches bring attainment of its root,
Hence it is said: attainment.
Thus the Sage embraces *yī* (一) as the model for all under Heaven.
*Yī* (一) is the utmost of fewness.
*Shì* (式) means "pattern," like "standard."
Not seeing oneself, so clarity;
Not asserting oneself, so manifest;
Not boasting, so merit;
Not vaunting, so virtue endures.
Only by not contending does one ensure no one can contend with them.
What was called "what is bent becomes whole" in antiquity—
Was it empty words?
Truly whole, and thus it returns.

**Chapter 23**
Sparse speech is natural.
To listen and not hear is called sparse.
The next chapter speaks of the Dao’s utterance:
"Faint and flavorless, unseen, unheard."
Yet if speech is flavorless and unheard,
Then it is the utmost of natural utterance.
Thus the gusting wind does not last a morning,
And the sudden rain does not last a day.
Who does this?
Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,
How much less can mortals?
Speaking of violent, swift, and fleeting beauty.
Thus those who follow the Dao—
Those who follow the Dao align with the Dao.
Following the Dao means acting in accordance with it.
The Dao, with its formlessness and non-action,
Completes and aids all things,
So those who follow the Dao take non-action as their lord,
Silence as their teaching,
Continuous as if ever-present.
Things attain their true nature and align with the Dao,
Thus it is said: they align with the Dao.
Those who attain virtue align with virtue—
Attainment means fewness; fewness brings attainment,
Thus it is said: they align with attainment.
Those who lose align with loss—
Loss means excess; excess brings loss,
Thus it is said: they align with loss.
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them;
Those who align with virtue, virtue delights in them;
Those who align with loss, loss delights in them.
Speaking of their actions meeting their kind,
Thus they respond in kind.
Lacking sincerity, there is no sincerity.

**Chapter 24**
The overreaching cannot stand—
Things, when advancing, lose stability, hence it is said: the overreaching cannot stand.
The striding cannot move—
Those who see themselves are not clear,
Those who assert themselves are not manifest,
Those who boast have no merit,
Those who vaunt have no enduring virtue.
In the Dao, it is called surplus food and superfluous movement.
If discussed in terms of the Dao,
It is like rejecting what is essential and indulging in excess.
Even if the root is beautiful, it may become defiled;
Even if there is merit, boasting of it makes it a blemish.
Things may hate it,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.

**Chapter 25**
There is a thing, indistinctly formed,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Indistinctly formed, yet all things arise from it,
Thus it is called indistinctly formed.
Unknown whose offspring it is,
Thus it is born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and void, standing alone, unchanging—
Silent and void, without form.
Without equal, hence it is said: standing alone.
Returning to transformation, beginning and end without loss of its constancy,
Thus it is said: unchanging.
Circulating endlessly without peril,
It can be the Mother of all under Heaven.
Circulating endlessly without failing, it sustains the complete and great form,
Thus it can be the Mother of all under Heaven.
I do not know its name—
Names fix forms; the indistinctly formed has no form,
Thus it cannot be fixed, hence it is said: I do not know its name.
I call it the Dao—
Names fix forms; words are given to what can be spoken.
The Dao is taken from what is without substance yet does not depend on it,
Thus within the indistinctly formed, it is the greatest nameable designation.
I forcibly name it: the Great.
The reason I call it the Dao is that it is the greatest nameable designation.

---

The source of its named designation is tied to the Great,
The Great has ties, hence must have divisions—
With divisions, its utmost is lost.
Thus it is said: *I forcibly name it the Great.*

The Great is called *Passing* (*shì*),
*Passing* is movement—
It does not cling to one great form,
Circulating endlessly without failing,
Thus it is said: *Passing.*

*Passing* is called *Distant* (*yuǎn*),
*Distant* is called *Returning* (*fǎn*).
*Distant* is the utmost—
Circulating endlessly without limit,
Not favoring one *Passing*,
Thus it is said: *Distant.*

Without following what it conforms to,
Its form stands alone,
Thus it is said: *Returning.*
Hence, the Dao is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
And the King is also Great.

Among the natures of Heaven and Earth,
Humans are most noble,
And the King is the sovereign of humans.
Though he does not directly wield the Great,
He is also Great.
Matching the three,
Thus it is said: *The King is also Great.*

Within the realm,
There are four Great ones:
The four Great ones are the Dao,
Heaven,
Earth,
And the King.

All things have names and designations,
Yet these are not their ultimate essence.
Speaking of the Dao gives rise to a source,
With a source, then it is called the Dao.
Yet this Great within named designations
Is not as vast as the Great without names.
The Great without names cannot be fixed as a realm,
For the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and King all exist within the Great without names,
Thus it is said: *Within the realm, there are four Great ones.*
And the King occupies one among them,
Residing in the Great of the sovereign of humans.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows Nature.

*Law* means principle—
Humans do not contravene Earth,
And thus attain full security,
Following Earth.
Earth does not contravene Heaven,
And thus attains full capacity,
Following Heaven.
Heaven does not contravene the Dao,
And thus attains full coverage,
Following the Dao.
The Dao does not contravene Nature,
And thus attains its essence,
Following Nature.

When square, it follows square;
When round, it follows round—
In Nature, it contravenes nothing.

Nature is the speech of the unnameable,
The words of the utmost limits.
Intellect cannot reach the unknowing,
Yet form and vitality cannot match the subtle essence;
The subtle essence cannot match the formless,
And things with ritual cannot match the ritual-less.
Thus, it turns to follow in kind.

The Dao conforms to Nature,
Heaven thus receives its form;
Heaven follows the Dao,
Earth thus takes its stance;
Earth follows Heaven,
Humans thus take their shape.

The reason the King is one among them
Is that he is the sovereign.

**Chapter 26:** Heavy is the root of light, stillness is the master of agitation.
All things: light cannot bear heavy, small cannot govern great.
The non-moving makes the moving move,
The non-agitated restrains the agitated,
Thus heavy must be the root of light,
And stillness must be the master of agitation.

Therefore, the Sage moves all day without leaving his baggage.
With heavy as foundation,
He does not depart.
Though adorned with splendor,
His dwelling remains serene and detached—
Not clinging to his heart.
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself against the world?
Lightness means losing his foundation,
Agitation means losing his mastery.
Lightness cannot govern heaviness,
Losing his foundation is to ruin his body,
Losing his mastery is to lose his sovereign position.

---
**Chapter 27:** Good conduct leaves no traces,
Following Nature in action,
Not contriving, not initiating,
Thus things attain their end without traces.

Good speech has no flaws,
Following the nature of things,
Not distinguishing, not analyzing,
Thus there are no flaws—
One can gain access to its principle.

Good reckoning does not use counting tools,
Following the numbers of things,
Not relying on form,
Good closure requires no bars or gates yet cannot be opened,
Good binding requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.
Following Nature’s natural course,
Not contriving, not applying,
Thus no bars, gates, cords, or knots are used,
Yet it cannot be opened or undone.
These five principles all speak of
Not contriving, not applying,
Following the nature of things,
Not using form to govern things.

Thus the Sage always rescues people well,
And so there are none abandoned;
The Sage does not establish fixed forms or names
To examine things,
Not contriving distinctions to favor the worthy and abandon the unworthy,
Assisting the self-so of all things without initiating,
Thus it is said: *There are none abandoned.*

He does not exalt the virtuous and capable,
And so the people do not vie;
He does not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,
And so the people do not steal;
He does not display what is desirable,
And so the people’s hearts are not disturbed.
Always keeping the people’s hearts free of desire and confusion,
Thus there are none abandoned.

Always rescuing things well,
Thus there are none abandoned—
This is called *Emulating the Bright* (*Xímíng*).

Thus good people are
The teachers of the not-good;
Using the good to teach the not-good,
Thus they are called teachers.
The not-good are
The resources of the good;
*Resource* means *to take*—
The good use the good to harmonize the not-good,
And to abandon the not-good,
Thus the not-good are what the good take from.

If one does not honor his teacher,
Or cherish his resource,
Though wise, he is greatly confused.
Though he has wisdom,
Relying solely on his own wisdom without following things,
In his Dao he must falter,
Thus it is said: *Though wise, he is greatly confused.*
This is called *Essential Mystery.*

「Knowing the masculine, keeping the feminine,
Is the Way of the world’s stream.

The Way of the world’s stream,
Ever holds virtue true,
Returning to the state of the infant.

The masculine belongs to the first,
The feminine to the last.
Knowing the first as the Way,
The last must follow—
Hence the Sage follows his own body,
Yet his body leads the world.

The stream does not seek things,
Yet things return to it.
The infant does not wield wisdom,
Yet it aligns with the natural wisdom of all.

Knowing the bright, keeping the dark,
Is the Way of the world’s model.

The model is the standard of form.
The Way of the world’s model,
Ever holds virtue unerring—
Unerring means no deviation.
Returning to the state of the Boundless.

The Boundless cannot be exhausted.
Knowing the honor, keeping the shame,
Is the Way of the world’s valley.

The Way of the world’s valley,
Ever holds virtue complete,
Returning to the state of the Uncarved.

These three—
The Way reverses to its end,
Thus virtue attains fullness in its dwelling.

The next chapter says:
*The reversal is the movement of the Dao;*
Its work cannot be claimed,
Ever abiding in its origin.

The Uncarved scatters and becomes vessels;
The Sage uses it and becomes ruler.
The Uncarved—true essence—
When scattered, gives rise to myriad actions,
Distinct types emerge, like vessels.

The Sage follows its natural division,
Thus establishes rulers,
Using the good as teachers,
The not-good as resources,
Transforming customs and mores,
Restoring all to unity.

Hence the great standard is not severed.
The great standard—
Taking the world’s heart as one’s own—
Thus there is no severing.

**Chapter 29**
When one would take the world by force,
I see it as not inevitable.

The world is a divine vessel—
Divine means formless and boundless,
A vessel means a harmonized whole.
Formless yet harmonized,
Thus it is called a divine vessel.

It cannot be forced.
Forcing brings ruin,
Grasping brings loss.
All things take their nature as given,
Thus one may follow it but not force it,
May guide it but not grasp it.
If one creates against its nature,
It must bring ruin;
If one clings to its coming and going,
It must bring loss.

Thus things may flourish or wither,
May rise or fall,
May grow strong or weak,
May be chipped or shattered.
Hence the Sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids dominance.

All these *or*s—
Speak of things and affairs
Inverting, obeying, or returning,
Not to be forced or severed by action.

The Sage reaches the utmost of nature,
Unfolds the emotions of all things,
Thus follows without forcing,
Aligns without imposing,
Removes what confuses,
Discards what bewilders,
Hence his heart remains undisturbed
While the nature of things finds its own fulfillment.

**Chapter 30**
To assist the ruler with the Dao,
Is to not use force of arms to subdue the world.
To assist the ruler with the Dao,
Already cannot rely on arms to subdue the world—
How much more so if the ruler himself abides by the Dao!

His affairs delight in returning.
Those who begin with force
Seek to establish deeds and create affairs,
But those who follow the Dao
Seek to return and undo all doing—
Hence it is said: *His affairs delight in returning.*

Where the teacher dwells,
Thorns and brambles grow.
After great armies,
There must be years of calamity.
The teacher is a harmful thing,
Bringing no aid, only injury.
It plunders the people,
Devastates the fields,
Hence it is said: *Where the teacher dwells, thorns and brambles grow.*

The good use the teacher,
Yet do not dare to seize and force.
Seizing means to aid.
The good who use the teacher
Do so only to relieve difficulties—
Not to seize the world with arms.

When seizing, do not boast,
When seizing, do not vaunt,
When seizing, do not be proud—
I do not hold the teacher’s Dao as superior,
Using it only when there is no alternative—
What boasting or pride could there be?

When seizing is inevitable,
When seizing, do not force.
Though arms are used to achieve victory
And relieve difficulties,
The moment is not to be seized
To force the world.

Things grow strong, then age—
This is called *not the Dao*,
And *not the Dao* soon perishes.
Strong means violent force arises,
Illustrating those who use arms to force the world.
A gusting wind does not last a morning,
A sudden rain does not last a day—
Hence violent force must not be the Dao,
And *not the Dao* soon perishes.

**Chapter 31**
Fine arms are not auspicious instruments;
Things are bewildered and hate them,
Thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.

The gentleman, when at rest, values the left;
When using arms, values the right.
Arms are not auspicious instruments,
Not the tools of the gentleman—
Used only when there is no alternative,
Calmness and moderation are supreme.

Victory yet not glorying in it,
And glorying in victory—
This is to delight in killing.
He who delights in killing
Cannot fulfill his desires in the world.

Auspicious matters honor the left;
Inauspicious matters honor the right.
The Left General is stationed on the left,
The Right General on the right—
Illustrating the treatment with funeral rites.
The multitude of those who kill,
Are to be mourned with sorrowful tears—
Victory is treated with funeral rites.

**Chapter 32**
The Dao is ever nameless,
Yet the world cannot subjugate it.
If lords and kings can guard it,
All things will come as guests of their own accord.

The Dao is formless and does not bind,
Ever nameless—
Taking the nameless as its constant,
Thus it is said: *The Dao is ever nameless.*

The Uncarved, as a thing,
Takes the heart of non-action—
Also nameless.
Thus to attain the Dao,
Nothing is better than guarding the Uncarved.

The wise can subjugate others,
The brave can command force,
The skillful can be employed in tasks,
The strong can be given heavy burdens—
But the Uncarved, as a thing,
Is indignant yet impartial,
Near to nothingness,
Thus it is said: *None can subjugate it.*

Embrace the Uncarved as the nameless,
Do not burden its true nature with things,
Do not harm its divine essence with desires—
Then things will come as guests
And the Dao will be attained.

Heaven and Earth unite,
Descending sweet dew—
The people do not command it,
Yet it is evenly distributed.
Heaven and Earth unite,
Then sweet dew descends without seeking;
I guard its true nature without doing,
Then the people are evenly nourished without command.

At first, the standard had a name,
And the name was already given.
This also is to know when to stop—
Knowing when to stop
Is to not begin.»

The beginning of governance refers to the time when the Uncarved first became rulers.
When rulers first establish governance, they cannot fail to assign names and define ranks to establish hierarchy, hence the saying: *"The beginning of governance has names."*

Beyond this point, men will contend over trifles—
Thus it is said: *"The names are already given."*
If one knows when to stop,
Then one does not begin.
To persist in naming and commanding things
Is to lose the root of governance—
Thus knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.

The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys in relation to the sea.
Rivers and valleys do not seek the sea,
Yet they naturally flow there without being summoned.
Those who practice the Dao in the world
Do not command yet all is balanced,
Do not seek yet all is attained—
Thus it is said: *"Like rivers and valleys in relation to the sea."*

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
He who knows others is wise,
But he who knows himself is enlightened.
He who knows others is wise—no more.
But he who knows himself stands above wisdom.

He who overcomes others is strong,
But he who overcomes himself is powerful.
He who overcomes others is strong—no more.
But he who overcomes himself loses nothing to diminish his strength.

To apply one’s wisdom to others
Is not as good as applying it to oneself;
To apply one’s strength to others
Is not as good as applying it to oneself.
When wisdom is applied to oneself,
Nothing avoids it;
When strength is applied to oneself,
Nothing can alter it.

He who knows contentment is rich,
For knowing contentment means nothing is lost—
Thus he is rich.

The resolute in action have willpower.
If one is diligent in action, their will must prevail—
Thus it is said: *"The resolute in action have willpower."*

He who does not stray from his path endures.
By self-awareness and measuring one’s strength,
Not straying from his path,
He must attain enduring longevity.

He who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.
Though dead, if the Way of life does not perish,
Then his life is fully preserved.
If the body perishes yet the Dao remains,
How much more so if the body lives and the Dao is not cut short?

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
The Great Dao is vast—
It can be turned left or right.
The Dao is boundless, adapting everywhere,
Turning freely above and below, yet its use knows no limits.

All things rely on it to live yet it does not claim,
Its work is done yet it does not name itself.
It clothes and nourishes all things yet does not lord over them—
Always without desire, it may be called *small*.

All things arise from the Dao yet do not know their source,
Thus the world is always in a state of non-desire,
And all things find their place.
If the Dao does not impose itself on things,
Then it is called *small*.

All things return to it yet it does not rule—
It may be called *great*.
All things return to it to live,
Yet its power makes them unaware of their origin—
This is not small, hence it may also be called *great*.
Because it never seeks to be great,
Thus it achieves greatness.

Greatness lies in the small,
Difficulty lies in the easy.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
Hold fast to the Great Image,
And the world will come to you.
The Great Image is the mother of all heavenly forms—
Neither cold nor warm, neither cool nor hot,
Thus it can embrace and govern all things without harm.
If the ruler holds to it,
Then the world will come to him.

When they come, they are not harmed,
And peace and stability endure.
Formless, unperceived,
It does not spread or display itself—
Thus all things come to it without obstruction.

Music and bait
Can make passing travelers stop.
The Dao, when spoken of,
Is bland, without taste.
To look at it, it is insufficient;
To listen to it, it is inaudible;
To use it, it is inexhaustible.
This speaks to the Dao’s profundity.

When people hear the words of the Dao,
They prefer music and bait—
What delights the senses in the moment.
Music and bait can make passing travelers stop,
Yet the Dao’s words are bland and tasteless.
To look at it, it does not satisfy the eyes;
To listen to it, it does not please the ears.
If it does not strike the senses,
Yet when used, it cannot be exhausted.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**
To contract, one must first expand;
To weaken, one must first strengthen;
To destroy, one must first establish;
To take away, one must first give—
This is called *subtle clarity*.

To remove the strong and violent,
To eliminate disorder,
One must employ these four methods.
By following the nature of things,
Let them destroy themselves—
No need for harsh punishment to remove what must be removed,
Thus it is called *subtle clarity*.

If one fills their expansion to its fullest
Yet still demands more expansion,
Then all will resist.
If one’s expansion is insufficient
Yet one insists on demanding more,
The more one seeks, the more one endangers oneself.

The soft overcomes the hard.
Fish cannot be dragged from the depths,
And the sharpest tools of state
Should not be displayed to the people.
Sharp tools are what benefit the state.
Yet one must rely on the nature of things,
Not resort to force to govern.
If tools are unseen,
Yet all things find their place,
Then they are the sharpest tools of state.
To display them to the people is to rely on punishment.
Punishment, if used to benefit the state,
Will fail.
Fish dragged from the depths will surely be lost.
To display the sharpest tools of state to the people
Will also surely fail.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
The Dao is ever without action,

The Way follows nature’s course,
Yet nothing remains undone.
All things are governed and perfected through action.

If lords and kings could preserve this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation stirs to take form,
I shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity.
When transformation stirs to take form—
to form and complete itself—
I shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity,
Not ruling as a sovereign.
The nameless simplicity—
It will also have no desires.
No desires mean no rivalry.
Without rivalry, all will settle in stillness,
And the world will naturally find its order.

---
**Chapter Thirty-Seven (continued)**
The Dao is ever without action,
Yet nothing remains undone.
All things are governed and perfected through its action.

If lords and kings could preserve this,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation stirs to take form,
I shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity.
When transformation stirs to take form—
to form and complete itself—
I shall restrain it with the nameless simplicity,
Not ruling as a sovereign.
The nameless simplicity—
It will also have no desires.
No desires mean no rivalry.
Without rivalry, all will settle in stillness,
And the world will naturally find its order.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**

The virtue of the highest Dao is not virtue,
And thus it has virtue.
The virtue of the lowly Dao does not lose virtue,
And thus it has no virtue.

The highest virtue acts without action yet nothing is left undone;
The lowly virtue acts and yet has much to do.

The highest benevolence acts yet nothing is left undone;
The highest righteousness acts and yet has much to do.

The highest propriety acts and none respond,
So it forces compliance with raised arms.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.

For propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
And the beginning of chaos.
Preemptive knowledge is the flower of the Dao,
And the origin of folly.

Thus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality,
In reality, not in ornament—
Hence he discards the latter and embraces the former.

Virtue is that which is obtained.
To always obtain without loss,
To benefit without harm—
Thus it is called *virtue*.

How does one obtain virtue?
Through the Dao.
How does one exhaust virtue?
By acting without action—
Acting without action, nothing is left untransformed.

If there is no action, nothing is left ungoverned;
If there is action, it is insufficient to preserve life.
Thus, though heaven and earth are vast,
Their essence is inaction;
Though sages and kings are great,
Their foundation is emptiness.

Hence it is said:
To return to the origin and observe,
The heart of heaven and earth is revealed;
To ponder it at its zenith,
The profound vision of the ancient kings is attained.

To extinguish self-interest and abandon the ego,
Then the four seas will gaze upon you,
Near and far will come without summoning.
To abandon the self while preserving the heart,
Then not even a single body can remain whole,
Nor can flesh and bone tolerate one another.

Thus, the man of highest virtue
Uses only the Dao,
Does not cling to virtue,
Holds nothing fast—
And so, though he has virtue, he does nothing,
Yet nothing remains undone.
He seeks nothing yet obtains,
Acts yet achieves—
And so, though he has virtue, he bears no name of virtue.

The lowly virtue seeks and obtains,
Acts and achieves—
And so establishes goodness to govern things,
And thus bears the name of virtue.
To seek and obtain is to invite loss;
To act and achieve is to invite ruin.
Good names arise, and evil follows in response.
Thus, the lowly virtue acts and yet has much to do.

To act without preference is to act without partiality.
All who cannot act without action are of the lowly virtue—
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and ritual norms.

To illustrate the hierarchy of virtue,
The lowly is contrasted with the highest.
Even when the lowly reaches the extreme of "without action,"
It is still beneath the highest benevolence.
To act while claiming "without action"
Is to invite the calamity of action itself.

The root lies in inaction;
The mother is in the nameless.
To abandon the root and forsake the mother,
Though achievements may be great,
They will not be fulfilled.
Though names may be fair,
Deception will inevitably arise.

Unable to achieve without action,
Unable to govern without exertion—
Then one must act,
And so there are those who widely bestow benevolent love,
Yet love without partiality.

Thus, the highest benevolence acts,
Yet nothing is left undone.
Love cannot be all-encompassing,
So there are those who suppress and oppose,
Who aid the crooked and attack the straight,
Who use things and hearts alike.
Thus, the highest righteousness acts,
And yet has much to do.

Righteousness cannot be steadfast,
So there are those who adorn themselves with ritual,
Who value propriety and respect,
Who scrutinize every exchange—
And so resentment arises where none should be.
Thus, the highest propriety acts,
And none respond,
So it forces compliance with raised arms.

The ultimate is the Dao alone.
From this point onward, what is there to revere?

Thus, even if one’s **virtue** is great and achievements vast,
Wealthy with all things in abundance—
Each still gains its own **virtue**,
Yet cannot fully attain self-sufficiency.

Therefore, Heaven cannot be the **Dao**’s burden,
Earth cannot be its shelter,
Nor can humanity nurture all things.

Though it is honored for its **non-action**,
One cannot abandon **non-action** as its essence.

To abandon **non-action** as its essence,
Then one loses its greatness—
This is called losing the **Dao** and then having **virtue**.

Using **non-action** as a method,
**Virtue** is its mother#1,
So one can act without exertion,
Yet nothing remains unattended.

From this point onward,
One loses the mother of **non-action**.

Unable to value **non-action** yet cherish wide benevolence,
Unable to cherish wide benevolence yet value uprightness,
Unable to value uprightness yet cherish ritual and respect—
This is called losing **virtue** and then having benevolence,
Losing benevolence and then having righteousness,
Losing righteousness and then having propriety.

For propriety begins with insincere loyalty and trust,
And superficial simplicity without depth.
Its censure is only on the surface,
Its subtle intrigues hidden in contention.

Benevolence and righteousness arise from within,
Yet even these are feigned—
How much more so when one labors over outward display and expects it to endure?

Thus, propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trust,
And the source of chaos.

The **foreknowledge** of the past
Is knowing what others have known.
It is the rank of lesser **virtue**,
Exhausting one’s wisdom to foresee,
And straining one’s intellect for trivial affairs.
Though **virtue** may seem sincere,
Craft and deceit grow ever more refined;
Though fame may flourish,
It only deepens the loss of true substance.
Laboring yet governing in confusion,
Striving yet bringing corruption—
Even with all the wisdom of the sages,
The people suffer more.

To abandon oneself and follow things,
Then **non-action** prevails and tranquility is achieved.
To cling to simplicity and naturalness,
Then one defies conventional rules and norms.
To take what is gained by others,
And discard what one holds—
This is the superficial understanding of the **Dao**,
And the root of all folly.

Thus, if one attains the **Dao**’s mother of function,
All things act without resistance,
All affairs persist without labor.
Its influence is not seen in form,
Its control is not named—
So benevolence and righteousness may be displayed,
And ritual and respect made manifest.

To bear all upon the **Dao**,
And steady with the **nameless**,
Then nothing is held in higher regard,
No schemes are pursued—
Each abides by its true nature,
Affairs are conducted with sincerity.
Then benevolence is thick with **virtue**,
Righteousness is upright,
And ritual and respect are clear.

To abandon what bears them,
To forsake their origin—
To use their completed forms,
To strain one’s brilliance—
Then benevolence is merely sincere,
Righteousness is but contention,
And propriety is mere rivalry.

Thus, the depth of benevolence
Is not achieved by using benevolence alone.
The uprightness of righteousness
Is not accomplished by using righteousness alone.
The clarity of ritual and respect
Is not attained by using propriety alone.

To bear all upon the **Dao**,
And unite with its mother—
Then what is displayed is without higher regard,
What is made manifest is without contention.
To use the **nameless**,
Thus names are firmly established.
To use the **formless**,
Thus forms are fully realized.
To keep the mother and preserve its child,
To exalt the root and lift its branches—
Then form and name are both complete,
And perversity does not arise.
Great beauty aligns with Heaven,
And superficiality is not formed.

Thus, the mother must not be abandoned,
The root must not be lost.
Benevolence and righteousness,
Are born from the mother—
Yet they cannot be the mother themselves;
Form and tools,
Are crafted by the artisan—
Yet they cannot be the artisan themselves.
To abandon the mother and use its child,
To forsake the root and follow its branches—
Names then have divisions,
Forms then have limits.
Though great in extent,
There will be gaps;
Though abundant in beauty,
There will be hidden woes.
The **function** lies in action itself—
How could it rest in mere names?

**Chapter 39:** The ancient masters who attained **Oneness**—
*Ancient*, the beginning;
**Oneness**, the first number and the limit of things.
Each recognizes **Oneness** in its own thing,
The principle by which it rules.
All things gain this **Oneness** to complete,
Once complete, they merge to dwell within.
To dwell within is to lose their mother.

Thus, they all split, decay, exhaust, and perish.

Heaven gains **Oneness** and becomes clear,
Earth gains **Oneness** and becomes settled,
The **spirit** gains **Oneness** and becomes agile,
The **grains** gain **Oneness** and become full,
All things gain **Oneness** and come to life,
And the **sovereigns** gain **Oneness** to rule the world with sincerity.

Their attainment—
Each gains **Oneness** to achieve clarity, settlement, agility, life, and sincerity.

Heaven cannot maintain clarity without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear splitting—
*Clarity is achieved through **Oneness**, not by using clarity to achieve clarity.*
To hold **Oneness** is to never lose clarity,
To use clarity is to fear splitting.
Thus, **Oneness** is the mother of **function**,
And must not be abandoned.

Therefore, all avoid using their **function**,
For fear of losing their root.

Earth cannot maintain settlement without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear decay,
The **spirit** cannot maintain agility without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear exhaustion,
The **grains** cannot maintain fullness without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear depletion,
All things cannot maintain life without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear destruction,
And the **sovereigns** cannot maintain noble elevation without **Oneness**,
Or it would fear decline—
Thus, nobility lies in humility as its root,
And elevation lies in lowliness as its foundation.

Therefore, the **sovereigns** call themselves lone and humble,
Without the abundance of grains—
Is this not humility as their root?
Is it not so?

Thus, though fame may be attained,
It is without true praise—
Not desiring to shine like jade,
Or be rough like stone.
Clarity cannot be valued for its clarity alone,
Fullness cannot be multiplied alone—
Nobility lies in its mother,
Yet the mother has no noble form.
Nobility is achieved by humility as its root,
Elevation by lowliness as its foundation—
Thus, though fame may be attained,
It is without true praise.

Jade and stone shine and are rough,
Their substance exhausted in form—
Thus, they are not desired.

**Chapter 40:** The **Dao**’s movement is in return—

The foundation of elevation lies in lowliness as its root,
Nobility in humility as its source,
Use in emptiness as its substance—
This is its reversal.

When movement knows its emptiness,
Then all things are harmonized.

Thus it is said: *Reversal is the Dao’s movement.*
Weakness is the Dao’s function.

The soft and the weak are universally harmonized,
Beyond exhaustive measure.

All things under heaven are born of being,
Yet being is born of non-being.

All things under heaven take being as their life,
Yet the origin of being lies in non-being.

To preserve being fully,
One must return to non-being.

**Chapter 41:**
The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it—
This is resolve.
The middle person hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly,
The inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—
If they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.

Thus it is said:
*Establish* (as in *upright*) speech with being—
*Establish* means *to set upright*.
Clarify the Dao as if in darkness,
Shine without dazzling.
Advance the Dao as if retreating,
Put yourself last and yet lead,
Put yourself outside and yet endure.
Level the Dao as if uneven—
*Uneven*, like the soil within.
The great leveling of the Dao follows things’ nature,
Not forcing uniformity to carve them—
Its leveling is unseen,
Thus it returns as if uneven, like soil within.

The highest virtue is like a valley—
Not cherishing its virtue,
Holding nothing in reserve.
The greatest brightness is like a stain—
Knowing its brightness,
Yet guarding its darkness,
Only then attaining true brightness.
Ample virtue seems insufficient—
Ample virtue is not full,
Boundless and formless,
Unfillable.

Establish virtue as if lazy—
*Lazy*, like a match.
To establish virtue is to follow things’ natural course,
Neither forcing nor applying,
Thus it seems lazy and unmatched.
True substance seems false—
True substance does not flaunt its truth,
Thus it seems false.
The greatest square has no corners—
Square yet not rigid,
Thus it has no corners.
Great vessels take long to form—
Great vessels formed,
The world does not hold them complete.
Thus they must take long to form.

Great music is rare in sound—
Hearing it, one does not hear—
Called *rare*, a sound one cannot hear.
Sound implies division,
Division implies it is not *gong* but *shang*—
Division cannot govern all,
Thus sound is not great music.
Great forms are shapeless—
Form implies division,
Division means not temperate but extreme,
Not extreme but cold,
Thus forms with shape are not great forms.

The Dao is hidden, nameless.

Only the Dao
Is good at lending and completing.
All these virtues
Are what the Dao completes.
In form, it becomes great form,
Yet great form is shapeless.
In sound, it becomes great sound,
Yet great sound is rare in hearing.
Things are completed by it,
Yet their completion is unseen,
Thus it is hidden and nameless.

*Lending* is not merely supplying what is lacking—
A single loan suffices to perpetuate its virtue,
Thus it is called *good at lending*.
*Completing* does not require the artificer’s craft—
Without things, it yet fulfills their form,
Thus it is called *good at completing*.

**Chapter 42:**
The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.

All things bear yin and embrace yang,
And through their harmonizing *qi* achieve balance.
What people detest
Are the lonely, humble, and unfilled—
Yet kings and dukes take them as their titles.

Thus some things are diminished to benefit,
Others are benefited to diminish.
All things, myriad forms,
Yet their return is to One.
How does one attain this One?
It arises from non-being.

From non-being comes One,
And One may be called non-being.
Already calling it One,
How could one avoid speaking of it?
Speaking of it as One,
How could it not be Two?
Having One and Two,
Then Three is born.
From non-being’s being,
Numbers end here—
Beyond this lies no Dao’s flow.

Thus I know the master of all things’ birth,
Though myriad forms they bear,
Their harmonizing *qi* is One.
The common people have hearts,
Diverse lands, varied customs—
Yet those who attain One
Are the kings and dukes.
Taking One as master,
How could One be abandoned?
The more one adds, the farther one strays,
Diminishing brings it near,
Diminishing to exhaustion,
Only then attaining its extreme.

Already calling it One,
Yet still reaching Three—
How much more so if its origin is not One,
And the Dao could be approached?

Diminishing to benefit—
This is no empty saying.
What people teach,
I also teach—
Not forcing others to follow me,
Yet using natural principle,
Upholding its highest truth:
Conforming brings fortune,
Defying brings calamity.
Thus when people teach,
Defying brings their own calamity—
Just as I teach people not to defy.

The forceful and rigid do not meet a good end.
I will take this as my teacher.
The forceful and rigid
Will not meet a good end.
If people teach as forceful and rigid,
Then it is as I teach people not to be forceful and rigid.
Shall I raise the forceful and rigid’s failure to teach?
If it is said that conforming to my teaching brings fortune,
Then those who defy my teaching
Are precisely those who can serve as my teacher.

**Chapter 43:**
The softest under heaven
Overcomes the hardest under heaven—

---

**Chapter 44:**
Qi permeates everywhere without obstruction,
Water flows through everything without hindrance—
This is the Dao of the *jing* (經).
Without obstruction, there is no gap—
Thus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (無為).

The emptiness of *wu* (虚),
The weakness of *ruo* (柔弱),
Yet nothing they cannot traverse.
There is nothing they cannot exhaust—
The most yielding cannot be bent.
By this, I know the benefit of *wuwei*.

The teaching of the unsaid,
The benefit of *wuwei*—
Few under heaven can attain it.

**Chapter 45:**
The greatest completion seems incomplete,
Yet its use never fails;
It shapes itself with things,
Yet does not conform to a single form—
Thus it seems incomplete.

The greatest fullness seems void,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.
When fullness is complete,
It rises and falls with things,
And cherishes nothing—
Thus it seems void.

The greatest straightness seems crooked,
Yet it follows things to be straight—
Straightness is not confined to one thing—
Thus it seems crooked.

The greatest skill seems clumsy,
Yet the greatest skill shapes tools through natural principle,
Without contriving artificiality—
Thus it seems clumsy.

The greatest eloquence seems stammering.
Yet the greatest eloquence arises from things,
Without personal fabrication—
Thus it seems stammering.

Agitation conquers cold,
Stillness conquers heat—
Yet tranquility is the fundamental standard of the world.

Agitation, after its excess,
Then conquers cold;
Stillness, through *wuwei*,
Conquers heat—
By this, I know tranquility is the fundamental standard of the world.

Tranquility preserves the true nature of all things,
Agitation violates the nature of things—
Thus only through tranquility can one attain the above greatness.

**Chapter 46:**
When the Dao prevails under heaven,
Warhorses are turned into dung for the fields;
When the Dao prevails under heaven,
People know sufficiency, know cessation,
And seek nothing from beyond—
Each cultivates their own inner self—
Thus warhorses are turned into dung for the fields.

When the Dao does not prevail under heaven,
Warhorses breed in the suburbs.
Greed is insatiable,
They do not cultivate their inner selves,
Each seeks from beyond—
Thus warhorses breed in the suburbs.

No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,
No blame is greater than desiring more—
Thus, sufficiency in sufficiency,
Is always sufficient.

**Chapter 47:**
Without stepping outside the door,
One knows the affairs of the world;
Without peering through the window,
One sees the Dao of things.

Affairs have their roots, things have their masters—
Though paths differ, they share the same return;
Though thoughts are myriad, their intent is singular.

The Dao has its great constancy,
Principle has its great conclusion—
Clinging to ancient Dao,
One can govern the present.

Though dwelling in the present,
One can know the ancient origins—
Thus one need not step outside the door or peer through the window to know.

The farther one goes,
The less one knows.
Do not fixate on one thing,
Yet seek in the multitude.

The Dao cannot be seen,
Cannot be heard,
Cannot be grasped—
If one knows it,
There is no need to step outside the door.

If one does not know it,
The farther one goes, the more confused one becomes.

Thus the Sage does not act yet knows,
Does not see yet names—
Attaining the conclusion of things,
Thus though not acting, one’s thoughts can be known.

Discerning the root of things,
Thus though not seeing, one can obtain the logic of right and wrong to name.

Completion without action.
Understanding the nature of things,
Following them—
Thus though not acting, one can make them complete.

**Chapter 48:**
To study learning is to daily increase,
Always striving to advance one’s abilities,
To increase one’s practice.

To study the Dao is to daily decrease,
Always striving to return to emptiness.

Decrease again and again,
Until reaching *wuwei*—
*Wuwei* is yet to do nothing,
Yet nothing it cannot do.

Action leads to loss—
Thus *wuwei* is to lose nothing.

To take the world is to always do so without interference,
Movement is always in accordance with nature.

When interference arises,
It is self-made.
This is insufficient to take the world—
It is to lose the root of governance.

**Chapter 49:**
The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as their own.
Movement is always in accordance with nature.

The virtuous, I treat as virtuous,
The non-virtuous, I also treat as virtuous—
Virtue is thus not lost.
The trustworthy, I trust,
The untrustworthy, I also trust—
Trust is thus established.

The Sage, amidst the world,
Unifies the hearts of the people—
All fixate their ears and eyes,
Each using their own cleverness.

The Sage treats them all as children,
Making them harmonious and without desire,
Like newborn infants.

The heavens and earth set their positions,
The Sage completes their abilities—
Human schemes, ghostly schemes,
All are the abilities of the people.

Abilities are given to them,
Resources are taken by them—
Abilities are great, they become great;
Resources are noble, they become noble—
Things have their roots, affairs have their masters.

Thus one can wear the crown and sash,
Fill their eyes with ornaments,
Yet not fear deceit;
Stuff their ears with coarse cloth,
Yet not grieve from insult—
Why labor one’s own cleverness
To discern the emotions of the people?

If one uses cleverness to discern things,
Things will also vie with their cleverness in response.
If one uses distrust to discern things,
Things will also vie with their distrust in response.

The hearts of the world are not necessarily the same,
Yet if their responses dare not differ,
None will dare to use their own cleverness.

Great indeed is the harm of cleverness—
None greater than using one’s cleverness.

If one’s cleverness does not surpass others,
Yet stands in the realm of contention—
It will reach its limits;
If one’s strength does not surpass others,
Yet stands in the realm of struggle—
It will be in peril.

None can make others refrain from using their cleverness or strength against you—
Thus you confront one with your own,
While others confront you with thousands and ten-thousands.

If one multiplies laws and penalties,
Blocks paths and attacks hidden dwellings,
Then all things lose their natural course,
And the people abandon their hands and feet.

The birds are in chaos above,
The fish are in chaos below—
Thus the Sage, regarding the world,
**shēsè** *[1]* his heart, with no fixed master.
He acts with a **húnxīn** *[2]* for the world,
His intent nowhere directed, his will nowhere attached.

He discerns nothing—
Why should the people avoid him?
He demands nothing—
Why should the people obey him?
With no avoidance and no compliance,
None dare fail to use their own **qíng** *[3]*.

When people act without constraint,
They abandon what they can do to do what they cannot,
They abandon what they excel at to do what they lack.

Thus, those who speak say what they know,
Those who act do what they are able—
The people all focus their ears and eyes upon their own affairs,
And I simply nurture them like children.

**Chapter Fifty:**
Life emerges from death,
The realm of life, the realm of death.
Those who cling to life alone—thirteen in ten *[4]*
Those who cling to death alone—thirteen in ten,
And those who live yet are drawn into the realm of death—thirteen in ten.

Why is this so?
Because of the excess of life’s vitality.

It is said: One who masters life well,
Walks on land yet meets no **rìhú** *[5]* (rhinoceros and tigers),
Enters battle yet is not struck by weapons or blades.
The **rì** *[6]* has no place to thrust its horn,
The **hú** has no place to strike with its claws,
Weapons have no place to lodge their edges.

Why is this so?
Because there is no realm of death.

---

「十有三，犹云十分有三分。
Taking thirteen in ten,
It is as if saying ten parts with three fractions.

取其生道，全生之极，十分有三耳。
Taking the Dao of life,
Preserving life to its utmost—
Ten parts with three fractions.

取死之道，全死之极，十分亦有三耳。
Taking the Dao of death,
Preserving death to its utmost—
Ten parts with three fractions as well.

而民生生之厚，更之无生之地焉。
Yet the people’s excess of life’s vitality
Drives them to the realm where life ceases.

善摄生者，无以生为生，故无死地也。
Those who master life well,
Do not cling to life for life—
Thus, there is no realm of death.

器之害者，莫甚乎戈兵。
The greatest harm of weapons
Is none more severe than spears and blades.

兽之害者，莫甚乎兕虎。
The greatest harm of beasts
Is none more severe than rhinoceros and tigers.

而令兵戈无所容其锋刃，虎兕无所措其爪角，
Yet when spears and blades have no place to lodge their edges,
And rhinoceros and tigers no place to strike with claws and horns,

斯诚不以欲累其身者也，何死地之有乎？
This is truly one who does not burden himself with desires—
How could there be a realm of death?

夫蚖蟺以渊为浅，而凿穴其中；
The *yǎnwù* (salamander and tortoise) *[7]*
Treat the depths as shallow,
And dig their holes within.

鹰鹯以山为卑，而增巢其上。
The *yīngdiāo* (eagle and falcon) *[8]*
Treat the mountains as low,
And build their nests upon them.

矰缴不能及，网罟不能到，
Their snares cannot reach,
Their nets cannot ensnare—

可谓处於无死地矣。
One may say they dwell in the realm of no death.

然而卒以甘饵，乃入於无生之地，
Yet in the end, with sweet bait,
They enter the realm where life ceases—

岂非生生之厚乎？
Is this not the excess of life’s vitality?

故物苟不以求离其本，不以欲渝其真，
Thus, if things do not seek to depart from their root,
Nor do they corrupt their true nature through desire,

虽入军而不害，陆行而不可犯也。
Even in battle, they are unharmed,
And walking on land, they cannot be assailed.

赤子之可则而贵，信矣。」

---

**Chapter Fifty-One:**
The Dao gives birth to life,
Virtue nurtures and sustains it,
Things take their form from it,
And circumstances bring them to fruition.

Life is born, then nurtured,
Nurtured, then formed,
Formed, then brought to fruition.
How does it give birth?
The Dao.

How does it nurture?
Virtue.

How does it take form?
Things themselves.

How does it reach fruition?
Circumstances.

Only through the Dao,
Thus things can take form without material.
Only through circumstances,
Thus things can reach fruition without material.

All that is born and all that is accomplished
Have their origins.
If they have origins,
Then all originate from the Dao.

Thus, when pushed to its extreme,
It is also the utmost Dao.

Follow their origins,
And each finds its proper name.

Therefore, all things honor the Dao
And revere virtue.

The Dao is what things originate from,
Virtue is what they attain.
Attaining through origin,
Thus it is said: *"Not attained, it is lost."*

Revering it brings harm,
Not revering it is noble.

The Dao’s reverence,
Virtue’s nobility—
None command them, yet they arise naturally.

Life gives birth, yet does not possess,
Acts, yet does not claim.
Acting, yet not possessing—
Growing, yet not controlling,
This is called the **Xuan德** *(Xuan Virtue)* *[9]*.

Virtue exists, yet its master is unknown,
Emerging from the depths of obscurity—
Thus it is called the **Xuan德** *(Xuan Virtue)*.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Two:**
The world has its beginning,
And this beginning is the world’s mother.
If one masters the beginning,
Then one masters nurturing and sustaining it.

Thus, the world has a beginning,
And this beginning can be the world’s mother.

Having known its mother,
One may also know its offspring;
Having known its offspring,
One returns and guards its mother—
Thus, it will never perish.

The mother is the root,
The offspring are the branches.
Attaining the root to know the branches,
Not abandoning the root to chase the branches.

Block its **fuì** *(mouth/opening)* *[10]*,
Close its **mén** *(gate/door)* *[11]*.

The **fuì** is where desires originate,
The **mén** is where desires follow.

Thus, one’s whole life is not laborious;
Having no desires, one is perpetually at ease—
Thus, one’s whole life is not laborious.

Open its **fuì**,
Accomplish its affairs—
One’s whole life will never be saved.

Not questioning its source while accomplishing its affairs,
Thus, even one’s whole life will never be saved.

Seeing the small as clarity,
Guarding the soft as strength.

The merit of governance lies not in grandeur.
Seeing the great as unclear,
Seeing the small as clarity.

Guarding strength is not strength,
Guarding softness is strength.

Using its **guāng** *(radiance/splendor)* *[12]*,
Displaying the Dao to dispel the people’s confusion,
Returning to its own clarity.

Not seeing clearly—
This is the obscurity of perception.

「To avoid harm to oneself is called the habit of constancy—
This is the constancy of the **Dao/Way**.

Chapter 53: *If I could stand firm with knowledge,*
*And walk the **Dao/Way** in its entirety,*
*Only **shī** *(施, "bestowal/imposition")* would I fear.*

*If I could stand firm with knowledge,*
*And walk the **Dao/Way** throughout the world,*
*Only bestowal would I fear to impose.*

*The **Dao/Way** is exceedingly smooth and even,*
*Yet the people prefer narrow paths.*
*The **Dao/Way** is vast and unobstructed,*
*Yet the people cling to shortcuts and evils—*
*How much more so when one imposes bestowal,*
*To block the **Dao/Way**’s true course?*
*Thus it is said:*
*The **Dao/Way** is exceedingly smooth and even,*
*Yet the people prefer narrow paths.*

*The court is exceedingly pristine,*
*The palace halls are spotless.*
*The fields are overgrown with weeds,*
*The granaries are empty.*
*When the court is exceedingly pristine,*
*The fields grow wild,*
*The granaries stand void.*
*Thus, one’s actions bring harm to the multitude.*

*Wearing ornate attire,*
*Bearing sharp blades,*
*Feasting on delicacies,*
*Hoarding wealth beyond need—*
*This is called **dào kuā** *(盗夸, "robbery and ostentation")*,*
*Not the **Dao/Way** indeed.*

*All things, if gained not through their proper **Dao/Way**,*
*Are but crookedness—*
*Crookedness is robbery.*
*Ostentation, if not gained through their proper **Dao/Way**,*
*Is usurpation.*
*Thus, to enumerate what is not the **Dao/Way***
*Is to clarify robbery and ostentation.*

Chapter 54: *The well-built does not topple,*
*For it grounds its roots before nurturing its branches,*
*Thus it does not topple.*
*The well-embracing does not slip,*
*Not greedy for excess,*
*Balancing what it can sustain,*
*Thus it does not slip.*
*One’s descendants continue the rites of sacrifice,*
*If they pass down this **Dao/Way** to perform sacrifices,*
*Then the rites will not cease.*

*Cultivating it in oneself,*
*Its **virtue/power** *(德)* becomes true;*
*Cultivating it in the family,*
*Its **virtue/power** overflows;*
*Thus, it extends from oneself to others.*
*Cultivate it in the body, and it is true;*
*Cultivate it in the home, and it abounds.*
*If cultivation does not falter,*
*The bestowal grows ever greater.*
*Cultivating it in the village,*
*Its **virtue/power** becomes enduring;*
*Cultivating it in the state,*
*Its **virtue/power** becomes abundant;*
*Cultivating it throughout the world,*
*Its **virtue/power** becomes universal.*
*Thus, to observe oneself through oneself,*
*To observe the family through the family,*
*To observe the village through the village,*
*To observe the state through the state—*
*All these follow the same principle.*
*To observe the world through the world,*
*With the hearts of the world’s people,*
*To discern the **Dao/Way** of the world.*
*The **Dao/Way** of the world—*
*Its fortune and calamity,*
*Its joy and sorrow—*
*All follow the **Dao/Way** of humanity.*

*How do I know the world’s constancy?*
*By this.*
*This refers to the teachings above.*
*If one asks how I know the world,*
*It is by examining oneself,*
*Not by seeking knowledge from without.*
*This is what is meant by*
*"Knowing the world without leaving one’s door."*

Chapter 55: *The depth of **virtue/power** *(德)* is like that of a newborn babe,*
*Where bees, wasps, centipedes, and snakes do not sting,*
*Where fierce beasts do not seize,*
*Where birds of prey do not clutch.*
*The newborn babe has no desires, no cravings,*
*And does not offend against all things,*
*Thus venomous creatures do not harm it.*
*Those with deep **virtue/power***
*Do not offend against things,*
*Thus nothing can harm their completeness.*

*Though bones are frail and sinews soft,*
*Yet its grasp is firm.*
*Because of its softness and frailty,*
*Its hold is all the more unyielding.*
*Though it knows not the union of male and female,*
*Yet it grows fully.*
*Fully—meaning long in life.*
*Nothing harms its body,*
*Thus it grows fully and long.*

*Those with deep **virtue/power***
*Are not harmed by things,*
*Nor does their truth falter,*
*For softness and frailty do not contend,*
*Yet are never crushed or broken.*
*This is the utmost **harmony** *(和).*

*Crying all day without hoarseness,*
*It has no contentious or desiring heart,*
*Thus it cries all day without hoarseness.*

*Perfect **harmony** is perfect constancy,*
*For all things find constancy in **harmony**,*
*Thus knowing **harmony** brings constancy.*
*Knowing constancy is clarity,*
*Neither dim nor bright,*
*Neither warm nor cold—*
*This is constancy.*
*That which has no form yet cannot be seen is called clarity.*

*Excessive nurturing brings misfortune,*
*Nurturing cannot benefit life—*
*To nurture is to hasten its decline.*
*The heart that directs **qi** is called strength.*
*The heart should have no interference,*
*Yet to direct **qi** is to force strength.*
*When things are over-nurtured, they age prematurely,*
*This is called unnatural—*
*Unnatural brings early decay.*

Chapter 56: *The wise do not speak,*
*For they follow nature.*
*Those who speak are not wise,*
*For they create the origins of affairs.*

*To block its **fuì** *(兑, "radiance/response"),*
*To close its **mén** *(门, "gate/opening"),*
*To blunt its sharpness,*
*Is to hoard and guard its essence.*

*To dissolve its divisions,*
*Is to remove the roots of contention.*
*To harmonize its **guāng** *(光, radiance/splendor),*
*To display nothing in particular,*
*Then things will have no partial strife.*
*To blend with its dust,*
*To hold no particular lowliness,*
*Then things will have no partial shame.*

*This is called **Xuán Tóng** *(玄同, "mysterious unity").*
*Thus, it cannot be grasped as near,*
*Nor can it be grasped as distant;*
*If it can be grasped as near,*
*Then it can be grasped as distant.*
*It cannot be grasped for gain,*
*Nor can it be grasped for harm;*
*If it can be grasped for gain,*
*Then it can be grasped for harm.*
*It cannot be grasped as noble,*
*Nor can it be grasped as base;*
*If it can be grasped as noble,*
*Then it can be grasped as base.*

*Thus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.*
*Nothing can be added to it.*

Chapter 57: *To govern the state with uprightness,*
*To employ the **qí** *(奇, "unconventional/strategic")* in warfare,*
*To take the world with non-action.*

*To govern the state with the **Dao/Way** is to exalt its foundation,*
*Thus the people rest—*
*To govern with uprightness,*
*Then the **qí** and the **zhèng** *(正, "upright")* arise,*
*And to take the world with non-action*
*Is indeed possible.*
*The previous chapter states:*
*"Those who take the world*
*Always act with non-action."*
*When they have affairs,*
*Yet still lack the means to take the world,*
*Thus it is said:*
*"To govern the state with uprightness,*
*Then one cannot take the world,*
*Yet one must employ the **qí** in warfare."*

*To govern the state with the **Dao/Way***
*Exalts the foundation to restrain excess,*
*Yet to govern with uprightness*
*Establishes distinctions to attack what is extraneous.*
*If the foundation is not exalted,*
*And the excess is shallow,*
*The people have nothing to reach,*
*Thus one must resort to employing the **qí** in warfare.*

*How do I know this to be so?*
*By this.»

The world abounds in **taboos and prohibitions** *(忌讳, "avoidances and restrictions")*, yet the people grow ever poorer;
The people possess many **sharp implements** *(利器, "tools of advantage")*, yet the state grows ever more **corrupt and decadent** *(滋昏, "increasingly chaotic")*.
Sharp implements are all those tools by which one profits oneself.
When the people grow strong, the state grows weak.

When men are numerous in **crafts and cunning** *(技巧, "skills and stratagems")*, strange things proliferate;
When the people abound in **wisdom and insight** *(智慧)*, **deceit and artifice** *(巧伪, "clever falsity")* arise,
And when deceit and artifice arise, **wicked deeds** *(邪事, "deviant matters")* follow.
When laws and decrees grow **ostentatious and explicit** *(滋彰)*, thieves and robbers multiply.

To establish uprightness and **restrain the wicked** *(息邪, "halt the deviant")*, yet strange warfare is employed.
To abound in taboos and prohibitions, desiring to **shame poverty** *(耻贫, "disgrace impoverishment")*, yet the people grow ever poorer.
To possess sharp implements, desiring to **strengthen the state** *(强国, "fortify the realm")*, yet the state grows ever more chaotic.
All these seek to **discard the root to govern the branches** *(舍本以治末, "abandon the foundation to manage the extremities")*,
Thus leading to these consequences.

Therefore, the **Sage** *(圣人)* says:
*"I practice non-action, yet the people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, yet the people become upright;
I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity."*
What the ruler desires, the people hasten to follow.
What I desire, is only **non-desire** *(无欲, "lack of desire")*,
Yet the people also lack desire and naturally return to simplicity.

These four principles are to **exalt the foundation and restrain the extremities** *(崇本以息末)*,
To **revert without assault** *(不攻而使复之, "return without confrontation")*.

Its governance is **obscure and unassuming** *(闷闷, "dim and dim")*, its people are **pure and unadulterated** *(淳淳, "simple and simple")*.
The **skilled ruler** *(善治政者)* holds no form, no name,
No affairs, no uprightness to be cited—
Dim and dim, yet ultimately reaching **great harmony** *(大治, "grand order")*,
Thus it is said: *"Its governance is dim and dim."*

Its people have nothing to **contend or vie** *(争竞, "strive and compete")*,
Wide and generous, simple and unadulterated—
Thus it is said: *"Its people are simple and simple."*

Its governance is **scrutinous and meticulous** *(察察, "examining and examining")*,
Its people are **deficient and lacking** *(缺缺, "wanting and wanting")*.
To **establish legal punishments and names** *(立刑名, "set punishments and titles")*,
To **clarify rewards and punishments** *(明赏罚, "illuminate rewards and penalties")*,
To **restrain deceit and artifice** *(检奸伪, "inspect deceit and falsity")*—
Thus it is said: *"Its governance is examining and examining."*

Distinctions are **partitioned and analyzed** *(殊类分析, "differences classified and dissected")*,
The people grow deceitful and vie—
Thus it is said: *"Its people are wanting and wanting."*

**Calamity** *(祸)*, ah! It leans upon **fortune** *(福)*;
**Fortune**, ah! It harbors **calamity** *(祸)*.
Who knows their **limit** *(极, "extreme")*?
It is **non-action** *(无正, "lack of uprightness")*.

Who knows the **extreme of good governance** *(善治之极)*?
Only that which cannot be cited as uprightness,
Cannot be named as form—
Dim and dim, yet the world naturally transforms—
This is its extreme.

**Uprightness** *(正)* again becomes **strange** *(奇)*;
To govern with uprightness, one must then employ strange warfare—
Thus it is said: *"Uprightness again becomes strange."*

**Goodness** *(善)* again becomes **evil** *(妖)*;
To establish goodness and **harmonize all things** *(和万物, "conciliate myriad beings")*,
Yet then **evil** *(妖)* arises as a **calamity** *(患)*.

The **delusion of men** *(人之迷)* is indeed long.
Who knows the **extreme of good governance** *(善治之极)*?
Only that which cannot be cited as uprightness,
Cannot be named as form—
Dim and dim, yet the world naturally transforms—
This is its extreme.

**The Sage** *(圣人)* is **square yet does not cut** *(方而不割)*,
Guiding things with **rectitude** *(方, "squareness")*,
Discarding their **deviance** *(邪, "deviant")*.
Not cutting things with **rectitude**—
This is called: *"The great rectitude has no corners."*

**Moderate yet not harsh** *(廉而不剧)*,
Comfortable, **clear and moderate** *(清康, "pure and tranquil")*.
Harsh, **injury** *(剧, "excessive")*—
To **cleanse and moderate** *(清康)* the people,
To **purify and moderate** *(清民, "clarify the populace")*,
To **remove their deviance** *(去其邪)*,
To **remove their filth** *(去其污)*—
Yet not to **severely harm** *(刿伤, "maim and injure")* with cleansing and moderation.

**Straightforward yet not domineering** *(直而不肆)*,
Guiding things with **straightness** *(直, "directness")*,
To **remove their eccentricity** *(去其僻, "eliminate their crookedness")*,
Yet not to **provoke unrest** *(激沸, "agitate and boil")* with straightness—
This is called: *"Directness is like bending."*

**Bright yet not intimidating** *(光而不惧)*,
Illuminating their **delusion** *(迷, "bewilderment")* with **radiance** *(光, "luminosity")*,
Yet not to **expose their hidden faults** *(求其隐匿, "demand their concealments")* with brightness—
This is called: *"Clarifying the Dao/Way is like obscurity."*

All these are to **exalt the foundation and restrain the extremities** *(崇本以息末)*,
To **revert without assault** *(不攻而使复之)*.

**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality**

Frugality *(啬, "frugality")* is the greatest.
Nothing exceeds *(#1莫若, "nothing surpasses")*—
That is, frugality *(啬, "frugality")* is the farmer *(农夫, "husbandman")*.
The farmer’s cultivation of the fields *(治田, "governing the fields")* seeks to eliminate their **diversity** *(殊类, "varied types")* and return them to **uniformity** *(齐一, "harmonized unity")*.
To preserve their **natural state** *(自然, "spontaneity")* without **forcing their growth** *(急其荒病, "urging their barrenness")*,
To remove the causes of their **barrenness** *(荒病, "withering ailments")*—
This is to **align above with Heaven’s mandate** *(上承天命, "upwardly honor Heaven’s decree")* and **soothe below the people** *(下绥百姓, "downwardly pacify the populace")*,
Nothing surpasses this.

Only frugality *(啬, "frugality")* is called **early service** *(早服, "early governance")*.
**Early service** *(早服, "early governance")*—
That is, **constancy** *(常, "permanent principle")*.
**Early service** *(早服, "early governance")* is called **heavily accumulating virtue** *(重积德, "profoundly amassing virtue")*.
Only through **profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, "profoundly amassing virtue")*—
Not seeking **sharp and swift results** *(不欲锐速, "not desiring sharp speed")*—
Then one can **make constancy endure** *(乃能使早服其常, "thus enable early governance to persist")*,
Hence it is said: *Only through profoundly amassing virtue can one achieve early service.*

**Profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, "profoundly amassing virtue")* means **nothing is unconquerable** *(无不克, "no resistance remains")*,
**Nothing is unconquerable** *(无不克, "no resistance remains")*—
Then **none know its limits** *(莫知其极, "none fathom its extent")*.
The **Dao/Way** *(道, "Dao")* is **boundless** *(无穷, "endless")*.
**None know its limits** *(莫知其极, "none fathom its extent")*—
This is how one **may possess a state** *(可以有国, "can attain a realm")*.
If one **possesses a state** *(有国, "attains a realm")* with **limited virtue** *(有穷, "bounded virtue")*,
It is **not truly able to possess a state** *(非能有国也, "not indeed capable of attaining a realm")*.
The **foundation of possessing a state** *(有国之母, "root of attaining a realm")*—
This is how one **may endure long** *(可以长久, "can persist long-term")*.
The **reason a state is stable** *(国之所以安, "how a realm stands firm")*—
Is called its **foundation** *(谓之母, "its root")*.
**Profoundly amassing virtue** *(重积德, "profoundly amassing virtue")*—
This is to **seek only its roots** *(是唯图其根, "merely cultivate its foundation")*,
Then **tend to its extremities** *(然后营末, "afterward nurture its branches")*,
Only then does one **achieve its end** *(乃得其终也, "thus attain its fulfillment")*.
This is called: *The **Dao/Way of deep roots and firm foundations** *(深根固柢, "deep-rooted and firmly established")*, **long life and enduring vision** *(长生久视, "longevity and lasting insight").*

**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State, Like Cooking a Small Fish**

Governing a great state *(治大国, "governing a great realm")*—
Is like cooking a small fish *(若烹小鲜, "as if stewing a tiny fish")*.
**Not to disturb** *(不扰也, "not to agitate")*.
**Agitation** *(躁, "restlessness")* brings **many calamities** *(多害, "abundant harm")*,
**Calmness** *(静, "tranquility")* preserves **truth** *(全真, "whole integrity")*.
Thus, the greater the state *(其国弥大, "the more expansive the realm")*,
The more tranquil its ruler *(而其主弥静, "the more serene its sovereign")*,
Only then can one **broadly win the hearts of the people** *(然后乃能广得众心矣, "thus widely secure the people’s loyalty")*.

If one **rules the world with the Dao/Way** *(以道莅天下, "governs the world through the Dao")*,
Its **spirits** *(其鬼, "its numinous forces")* are **not numinous** *(不神, "not revered")*.
To govern a great state like cooking a small fish *(治大国则若烹小鲜, "governing a great realm as if stewing a tiny fish")*—
If one **rules the world with the Dao/Way** *(以道莅天下, "governs the world through the Dao")*,
Then its **spirits** *(其鬼, "its numinous forces")* are **not numinous** *(不神, "not revered")*.
Not that its **spirits** *(其鬼, "its numinous forces")* are **not numinous** *(不神, "not revered")*—
But that their **numinosity** *(其神, "their reverence")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, "not injure mortals")*.
**Numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* does **not harm spontaneity** *(不害自然也, "not violate spontaneity")*.
Things **abide by spontaneity** *(物守自然, "creatures adhere to spontaneity")*,
Then **numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* has **nothing to add** *(无所加, "no place to impose")*.
**Numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* has **nothing to add** *(无所加, "no place to impose")*—
Then **none know numinosity as numinous** *(则不知神之为神也, "none recognize reverence as reverence")*.
Not that its **numinosity** *(其神, "their reverence")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, "not injure mortals")*—
The **Sage** *(圣人, "Sage")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, "also does not injure mortals")*.
When the **Dao/Way is harmonized** *(道洽, "the Dao is complete")*,
Then **numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, "not injure mortals")*—
Then **none know numinosity as numinous** *(则不知神之为神也, "none recognize reverence as reverence")*.
When the **Dao/Way is harmonized** *(道洽, "the Dao is complete")*—
The **Sage** *(圣人, "Sage")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, "also does not injure mortals")*—
Then **none know the Sage as Sage** *(则亦不知圣人之为圣也, "none recognize the Sage as Sage")*.
It is said: *Not only do they not know numinosity as numinous,
They also do not know the Sage as Sage.*

Those who **rely on the net of coercion** *(恃威网, "lean on the web of authority")* to **command things** *(以使物者, "direct creatures")*—
This is the **decline of governance** *(治之衰也, "waning of rule")*.
To **make them unaware of numinosity and sainthood** *(使不知神圣之为神圣, "cause them to not recognize reverence and sainthood as such")*—
This is the **ultimate of the Dao/Way** *(道之极也, "apex of the Dao")*.
The **two** *(两, "the two")*—
**Numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* and **the Sage** *(圣人, "Sage")*—
**Do not harm each other** *(不相伤, "do not injure one another")*,
Thus their **virtue** *(德, "virtue")* **returns in harmony** *(交归焉, "intermingles and returns")*.
**Numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, "not injure mortals")*—
The **Sage** *(圣人, "Sage")* also does **not harm people** *(亦不伤人, "also does not injure mortals")*.
The **Sage** *(圣人, "Sage")* does **not harm people** *(不伤人, "not injure mortals")*—
**Numinosity** *(神, "reverence")* also does **not harm people** *(神亦不伤人, "reverence also does not injure mortals")*.
Hence it is said: *The two do not harm each other*—
**Numinosity** and **sainthood** *(神圣, "reverence and sainthood")* **unify with the Dao/Way** *(合道, "converge with the Dao")*,
Their **virtue** *(交归, "intermingling return")* **harmonizes** *(之也, "thus").*

**Chapter 61: Great States Are the Lowlands**

「People also do not injure mortals, the Sage does not injure mortals—
Then they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.
It is as though they say not only do they not know Numinosity’s way of being Numinosity,
But they also do not know the Sage’s way of being the Sage.
He who relies on the net of coercion to govern others,
Is the decline of governance.
He who makes others unaware of Numinosity and sainthood as Numinosity and sainthood,
Has reached the Dao’s ultimate expression.
　　Thus it is said: The two do not harm each other,
Hence their virtue intermingles and returns.
Numinosity does not harm people, the Sage also does not harm people—
The Sage does not harm people, Numinosity also does not harm people.
Hence it is said: The two do not harm each other,
Numinosity and sainthood converge with the Dao,
Thus their virtue intermingles and returns.

**Chapter 61: Great States Are the Lowlands**
The great rivers and seas dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,
And thus all the streams flow toward them.
Great states dwell in grandeur yet remain in the lowlands,
And thus all under Heaven flows toward them—
Hence it is said: *Great states are the lowlands.*

The confluence of all under Heaven,
Is where all under Heaven gathers and meets.
The receptive of all under Heaven,
Is tranquil yet does not seek—
And thus all things return to it.
The receptive always overcomes the assertive through its tranquility,
And the receptive is the lowly.
Because of its tranquility, it can be the lowly.
The receptive is the female—
The assertive is restless, turbulent, and greedy,
The female is always tranquil—
Thus it overcomes the assertive.
Because of its tranquility, it can also be the lowly,
Hence all things return to it.
Therefore, great states humble themselves to the lesser states—
Great states humble themselves, as though they say: *With the great state’s lowliness, the lesser state is taken.*
Then the lesser state attaches to it;
The lesser state humbles itself to the great state,
Then it takes the great state.
The great state receives it—
Thus some humble to take, some humble yet are taken.
It means that only through cultivating humility and lowliness
Can one then attain what each should have.
Great states do not seek to encompass all under Heaven,
Lesser states do not seek to serve the great state.
If both attain what they desire,
Then the greater should humble itself.
Lesser states cultivate lowliness,
And thus they are preserved—
But they cannot make all under Heaven return to them.
Great states cultivate lowliness,
And thus all under Heaven returns to them.
Hence it is said: *If each attains what they desire,*
*Then the greater should humble itself.*

**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of All Things**
The Dao is the mystery of all things—
Mystery, like warmth, can shelter and shade.
The good person’s treasure—
Treasure is used.
The unworthy person’s refuge—
Refuge is for preservation.
Fine words can be sold,
Venerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.
It means the Dao precedes all things,
And nothing is more precious than this.
Though there be rare treasures and jade discs with fine horses,
Nothing can match it.
Fine words can seize the market price of all goods,
Hence it is said: *Fine words can be sold.*
Venerable conduct can respond even from a thousand miles away,
Hence it is said: *Venerable conduct can be bestowed upon others.*
What of the unworthy—
Why should they be abandoned?
The unworthy should preserve the Dao to avoid being cast aside.
Hence, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,
And appoints the Three Exalted Ministers—
It means to honor the Dao’s conduct.
Though there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,
They are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.
This is the Dao spoken of above.
It means that the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven,
And appoints the Three Exalted Ministers,
Honors their rank, and esteems their worth—
This is how the Dao is preserved.
Nothing is more precious than this,
Hence though there be jade discs held high and fine horses with harnesses,
They are not as good as sitting and offering this Dao.
The ancients valued those who aligned with the Dao—
Why not say that they sought it daily,
And were freed from blame?
Hence they are honored by all under Heaven.
To seek is to obtain,
To avoid blame is to be free—
The Dao applies everywhere,
Hence they are honored by all under Heaven.

**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**
To act without acting,
To govern without governing,
To savor without savoring—
To reside in non-action,
To teach through silence,
To find flavor in serenity and simplicity,
Is the ultimate of governance.
Great or small, many or few,
Repay resentment with virtue.
Small resentment is not enough to repay,
Great resentment is what all under Heaven would wish to punish—
Following what all under Heaven agree upon,
Is virtue.

Plotting difficulty from ease,
And greatness from smallness—
All under Heaven’s difficult tasks must arise from ease,
All under Heaven’s great tasks must arise from smallness.
Hence the Sage never acts in greatness,
And thus can achieve greatness.
Light promises must be few in trust,
Many easy things must bring many difficulties—
Thus the Sage says: *Even this is difficult,*
For the Sage’s talent still finds difficulty in small and easy matters,
How much more so for those who are not the Sage’s talent,
Yet wish to neglect this?
Hence it is said: *Even this is difficult.*
Thus there will never be difficulty.

**Chapter 64: The Art of Preserving the End**
Its stability is easily maintained,
Its beginnings are easily planned—
Because of its stability, one does not forget peril,
Maintaining it does not forget ruin,
Planning it without effort or strain,
Hence it is said: *easily.*
Its frailty is easily floated upon,
Its subtlety is easily dispersed—
Though it may be lost, no one will take it,
Because of its frailty and subtlety,
It is not sufficient to accomplish great deeds,
Hence it is said: *easily.*
These four sayings all discuss guarding the end.
One cannot neglect what is without maintaining it,
Cannot neglect what is subtle because it will disperse.
Without maintaining what is not, it will generate what is;
Without dispersing what is subtle, it will generate what is great.
Hence, consider the end’s calamity like the beginning’s ruin,
And there will be no failed undertakings.
Act before there is what to act upon—
It means its stability and unseen beginnings.
Govern before there is disorder—
It means its frailty and subtlety.
A tree thick enough to embrace,
Grows from a tiny sprout;
A nine-tiered tower,
Rises from piled earth;
A journey of a thousand miles,
Begins beneath one’s feet.
The doer brings ruin,
The grasper brings loss.
One should guard the end to eliminate frailty,
Guard frailty to eliminate disorder,
And thus apply non-action as governance,
And non-grasping as non-loss.
This reverses the origin of undertakings,
And cleverly creates what should not be—
Hence ruin and loss.
Thus the Sage acts without acting,
And thus there is no ruin;
Does not grasp,
And thus there is no loss.
The people’s undertakings,
Often fail just as they are about to succeed—
Because they do not guard the end.
Guarding the end like the beginning,
Wealth will not bring ruin.
Thus the Sage desires what he does not desire,
Does not prize what is hard to obtain—
Loves what is easy, though slight,
And strives for what is worth contesting.
What is hard to obtain, though small,
Will give rise to thieves—
Learning without learning,
Against the errors of the multitude—
Those who are learned yet do not learn,
Are naturally so.
It is like those who do not learn#2—
Errors.
Hence learning without learning,
To correct the errors of the multitude,
To assist the self-so of all things
Yet not daring to act.»

The cunning and deceitful are many—
Thus the people are hard to govern.
To rule the realm with cleverness,
Is the realm’s ruin—
For cleverness is but governance itself.
When one rules with cleverness,
It is called ruin—
Thus it is called cleverness.
The people are hard to govern
Because their cleverness is excessive.
The proper course is to block the senses,
Close the gates,
And let them be without knowledge,
Without desire—
Yet stir their wicked hearts with clever schemes.
Once stirred, then use subtle arts
To guard against their deceit.
When the people know these arts,
They evade and avoid them,
Plotting in secret, their deceit grows ever more.
Thus it is said:
To rule with cleverness is the realm’s ruin.

Not to rule with cleverness—
This is the realm’s blessing.
To know these two is to grasp the standard.
Ever knowing the standard,
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.
The Mysterious Virtue is profound and vast—
The standard, the same—
What is shared by past and present must not be abandoned.
To know the standard is to grasp the Mysterious Virtue,
Profound and vast—
Returning to its origin,
Restoring its truth—
Then attaining the Great Harmony.

The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys because they excel in humbling themselves, thus they are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys. Therefore, the Sage who wishes to lead the people must speak to them in humility; who wishes to go before the people must place himself behind them. Thus, the Sage, though in high station, is not burdensome to the people; though he leads, he does not harm them. Therefore, the world rejoices in promoting him without tiring. Because he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.

All under heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems ineffectual. Precisely because it is great, it seems ineffectual. If it were ineffectual, it would have long since been diminished. If it were diminished, it would have long been diminished. To be ineffectual is to lose what makes it great—thus it is said: if it were ineffectual, it would have long since been diminished.

I possess three treasures; guard them and preserve them:
First, compassion;
Second, frugality;
Third, not daring to be first under heaven.

Through compassion, one can be courageous.
Compassion, when deployed, conquers;
When held firm, it is steadfast—
Thus one can be courageous.

Through frugality, one can be expansive.
By moderating and conserving, one does not exhaust the world—
Thus one can be expansive.

Not daring to be first under heaven,
One can become the vessel and the leader.
Only by placing oneself last externally
Does one become the refuge for all things,
Then one can truly establish oneself as the vessel,
For the benefit of all things,
As their leader.

Now, to abandon compassion and yet seek courage—
This is to take.
To abandon frugality and yet seek expansiveness,
To abandon humility and yet seek to be first—
This is death.

Compassion, when wielded in war, conquers.
It presses forward without shirking difficulty,
Thus it is upright.
When held firm, it is steadfast.
Heaven, intending to aid it, guards it with compassion.

The skilled warrior does not rely on force.
The warrior is the leader of the soldiers.
Force is to exalt oneself and trample others.
The skilled fighter does not rage.
He follows without leading,
Responds without initiating—
Thus he does not rely on rage.

The skilled victor does not contend.
He does not contend with others.
The skilled user of men places himself beneath them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
This is called the power of using men.
If one uses men yet does not place himself beneath them,
Their strength cannot be employed.
This is called aligning with Heaven’s ancient norm.

When using arms, there is a saying:
I dare not be the attacker but only the defender,
I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.
This is called having no formation,
Yet they pursue relentlessly.
To repel without arms,
To seize without hands,
To grasp without weapons,
To cast without enemies—
This is to say that none can oppose it.
To repel without arms,
To grasp without weapons.

No greater calamity than to treat enemies lightly,
Lightly treating enemies nearly causes the loss of my treasures.
It is said: my compassion, humility, and non-contention
Are not meant to seek invincibility under heaven.
If forced to the point of invincibility,
Then this is the source of my greatest calamity.
Treasure refers to the three treasures—
Thus it is said: nearly losing my treasures.

When armies clash, the compassionate prevail.
*Anting* means to raise,
*Jia* means to confront.
The compassionate must cherish each other and not pursue gain or avoid harm—
Thus they must prevail.

My words are very easy to know,
Very easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can know them,
None can practice them.
One can know them without leaving one’s door or peering through the window—
Thus it is said: very easy to know.
Without action, yet accomplished—
Thus it is said: very easy to practice.
Some are agitated by desires—
Thus it is said: none can know them.
Others are bewildered by honor and profit—
Thus it is said: none can practice them.

Words have their root,
Affairs have their master.
The root is the root of all things.
The master is the master of all things.
Only those without knowledge fail to know me.
Because their words have a root and their affairs have a master,
Those with knowledge cannot fail to know me.

Few know me—
Thus I am precious.
Only because I am profound,
Are those who know me few.
The fewer who know me,
The more unmatched I am—
Thus it is said: few know me, thus I am precious.

Therefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while cherishing jade.
Wearing coarse cloth means blending with the dust.
Cherishing jade means treasuring the true.
The Sage’s difficulty in being known lies in blending with the dust yet not differing,
Cherishing jade yet not changing—
Thus he is difficult to know and yet precious.

The unknown knows—this is sickness.
The unknown knows its own insufficiency—this is sickness.
Only by recognizing sickness as sickness
Does one avoid sickness.
The Sage does not fall ill,
For he recognizes sickness as sickness—
Thus he does not fall ill.

When the people do not fear great authority,
Then great authority arrives.
Do not trifle with what sustains you,
Do not exhaust what nourishes you.
To dwell in stillness and non-action—this is *residence*.
To yield humbly without excess—this is *nourishment*.
Abandoning stillness and non-action,
Pursuing restless desires,
Discarding humility and yielding to authority—
Then things grow chaotic and the people stray.
Authority loses its power to govern,
The people cannot endure its rule,
And thus the upper and lower ranks collapse.
Heaven’s retribution is imminent—
Hence it is said: *When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives.*

Do not trifle with what sustains you,
Do not exhaust what nourishes you—
This means authority cannot be wielded recklessly.
Only by not exhausting,
Does one not exhaust oneself.
Not exhausting oneself,
Thus none under Heaven will exhaust you.
Therefore, the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,
Does not flaunt what he knows,
Lest his brilliance and authority be misused.
He cherishes himself without arrogance,
For arrogance invites contempt and exhaustion of what sustains.
Thus he discards that and embraces this.

「When one is bold yet daring, he will be slain,
Yet he cannot be said to die justly.
When one is bold yet does not dare, he will live—
His fate is aligned with the Dao.
These two paths—one brings gain, the other harm.
Both are bold, yet their application differs,
And so their outcomes diverge—hence it is said: *some bring gain, others harm.*
What Heaven abhors—who understands its reason?
Thus the Sage finds it difficult.
Who, indeed?—who can fathom Heaven’s abhorred intent?
Only the Sage.
The Sage’s wisdom still struggles with daring boldness,
Much less those without the Sage’s wisdom who would attempt it—
Hence it is said: *he finds it difficult.*

The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet prevails,
Though Heaven does not contend, none under Heaven can contend with it.
It does not speak yet responds well,
Favor brings fortune, opposition brings misfortune—
Thus it does not speak yet responds well.
It does not summon yet comes of its own accord,
And when it dwells below, all things return to it.
Modest yet skilled in planning,
It observes omens and discerns fortune and misfortune,
Prepares sincerity before events unfold,
And remains secure without forgetting peril.
It plans even before being summoned—
Hence it is said: *modest yet skilled in planning.*
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
Though sparse, it never fails to ensnare.
**Chapter 74**

If the people do not fear death,
How can you threaten them with death?
If you make the people always fear death,
And those who act strangely are deemed odd,
Then I can seize and kill them—who would dare?
Strange, deceitful, and disruptive actions that unsettle the masses are called *odd*.
Those who habitually execute killings do so.
The executors of death,
Are those who act as substitutes for the great carpenter’s axe.
Substitutes for the great carpenter’s axe,
Rarely fail to injure their own hands.
They are the objects of hatred for those who oppose or comply—
Hence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*
The unvirtuous,
Are what people detest—
Hence it is said: *those who habitually execute killings.*
**Chapter 75**

The people’s hunger,
Arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation.
Thus they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed,
Arises from their rulers’ excessive actions.
Thus they are difficult to govern.
The people’s disregard for death,
Arises from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life.
Thus they disregard death.
Only those who do not use life as a means,
Are wiser than those who value life.
It is said that the people’s depravity and the chaos in governance,
All stem from the rulers, not from the ruled.
The people follow their rulers.
**Chapter 76**

Humans, when born, are soft and weak,
But when they die, they become hard and strong.
All things, grass and wood, when born, are soft and brittle,
But when they die, they wither and decay—
Thus, the hard and strong belong to death,
And the soft and weak belong to life.
Therefore, strong armies cannot conquer,
For those who rely on strength to oppress the world,
Are what all things abhor—
Thus they cannot prevail.
Trees become rigid when they are strong,
For they are subjected to external forces.
Strength rooted in humility is the foundation,
And weakness rooted in arrogance is the branch.
**Chapter 77**

The Dao of Heaven—is it like drawing a bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised,
The abundant are diminished, the scarce are supplemented.
Heaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to nourish the scarce,
But human ways are not so—
Only by aligning with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
Can one encompass all things.
If one follows the Dao of Heaven,
And measures themselves by human standards,
Then each will have their own place,
And none can equal the others.
If one is only without self and without private interest,
And returns to the natural—
Then alone can they align with Heaven and Earth in virtue.
Diminish the scarce to nourish the abundant—
Who can have abundance to nourish all under Heaven?
Only those who possess the Dao.
Thus the Sage acts yet does not rely on it,
Achieves yet does not dwell in it—
He does not wish to display his virtue to equalize the world.
It is said that only those who can fully embrace excess and deplete what is lacking,
Supplement what is present to fill what is absent,
Blending their light with dust and harmonizing with the world,
Can truly equalize all things—
This is the Dao alone.
Thus the Sage does not wish to show his virtue to equalize the world.
**Chapter 78**

None under Heaven are as soft and weak as water,
Yet none can conquer what is hard and strong.
Its softness cannot be replaced.
*Water’s softness*, it is said,
Is such that no thing can replace it.
The weak overcoming the strong,
The soft overcoming the rigid—
None under Heaven do not know,
Yet none can practice it.
Thus the Sage says:
*"To bear the filth of the state,
Is to be the true guardian of its altars and grains."*
*"To bear the state’s misfortunes,
Is to be the true ruler of all under Heaven."*
Correct words as if they were reversed.
**Chapter 79**

To reconcile great grudges, there must remain lingering resentment—
For when the principle is not clarified at their root,
And virtue is used to reconcile them once they have arisen,
The harm is not undone,
And so lingering resentment remains.
How then can this be called good?

Thus the Sage holds the left contract,
For the left contract guards against where resentment arises.
Yet he does not blame others.

The virtuous oversee the contract,
For the virtuous in mind ponder its terms,
Preventing resentment before blaming others.

The unvirtuous oversee the punishment,
For punishment is the reckoning of others’ faults.

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites,
Yet it always sides with the good.
**Chapter 80**

In small states with few people,
Though the state is small and the people few,
They may yet return to the ancient ways—
How much more so in great states with many?
Thus, the Sage speaks of small states.

Let them possess tenfold or hundredfold tools,
Yet not use them—
For though the people have tenfold or hundredfold tools,
If they have no need for them,
What cause is there for want?

Let them value death and not wander far.
Let them be without use—
Treasure their bodies alone,
Uncovetous of wealth and bribes,
Thus each remains content in their place,
Valuing death and not wandering far.

Though they have chariots and boats,
They have no need to ride them;
Though they have armor and arms,
They have no need to array them.

**Chapter 81**

Let the people return to knotting cords for use.
Let them find their food sweet,
Their garments fine,
Their dwellings secure,
Their customs joyous.
Neighboring states gaze upon one another,
The sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them,
Yet the people live out their days to old age
Without visiting one another.
They seek nothing.

**Chapter 81**

Faithful words lack beauty,
For truth lies in simplicity.
Beautiful words lack faith,
For their root is in artifice.
The virtuous do not argue,
For those who argue are not virtuous.
The wise are not learned,
For their essence lies in singularity.
The learned do not know.

The Sage does not hoard,
For without selfishness, virtue suffices.
They give only to the good,
Trusting in the Way and doing nothing more.
The more they give to others, the more they possess.
Things return to them naturally.

The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,
For its motion ever brings forth and completes.
The Sage’s Way acts without contention,
Following Heaven’s benefit and causing no injury.

*The Dao De Jing (Laozi) Annotated, Volume Four, ends here.*

---
**Annotations (as per original text):**
#1 *"Mo ruo"* – Original reads *"Mo ru"* ("not as"), corrected to *"Mo ruo"* ("nothing surpasses") per Zhang’s text.
#2 *"Yu yu bu xue zhe"* – *"Bu"* (not) may be a redundant character.
#3 *"Li"* – Original reads *"Sui"* ("though"), corrected to *"Li"* ("separate") per Zhang’s text.
#4 *"Shi dai da jiang si"* – *"Dai"* (replace) was originally omitted, added from Zhang’s text.
#5 *"Wei ni shun zhe zhi suo wu fen ye"* – Likely a misplaced phrase; should read: *"For the perverse are what the compliant despise."*

The origins of this work are akin to the tradition of Yan Junping’s *Zhǐguī*, for it holds that benevolence and righteousness, along with ritual propriety, cannot be fully realized without the Way. Heaven and all things derive from the One—how much more so does this apply to the *Dao De Jing*? Indeed, all scholars ought to recognize this truth.

From this, I came to understand that Wang Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing* was profound, while his engagement with the *Yijing* was superficial. His interpretations of the *Yijing* often drew upon the principles of the *Dao De Jing*, yet the *Dao De Jing* required no such support from the *Yijing*. The traces of excess and deficiency are plainly evident.

Alas, how arduous is the pursuit of learning! Bi knew that fine arms are ominous instruments, yet when it came to victory in war, he treated it with funeral rites—this was not the teaching of Laozi, but rather the words of the Yellow River Master, who said: *"One who is always good at saving people thus abandons none; one who is always good at saving things thus discards none."* This passage does not appear in the ancient text, yet thanks to Fu Yi’s discernment, it was clarified.

Still, Bi titled this work the *Dao De Jing*, without distinguishing between *Dao* and *De* in their order, which remains close to the ancient tradition. Yet his text contains many errors and contradictions, some passages nearly unreadable—truly lamentable.

I have often said that Bi’s mastery of the *Dao De Jing*, Zhang Huan’s of the *Liezi*, Guo Xiang’s of the *Zhuangzi*, Du Yu’s of the *Zuozhuan*, Fan Ning’s of the *Guliang*, Mao Qeng’s of the *Shijing*, and Guo Pu’s of the *ErYa*—each perfected a singular school of thought. Though later scholars have followed, none have surpassed them.

Having transcribed Bi’s commentary and recorded these observations, I note this in the *Zhenghe* year of *Yiwu* (1115), the tenth month, on the *Dingchou* day, at Songshan, by the humble Zhào Shuò, then in exile at Fu Prefecture.

I, Xiong Ke, have also reverently recited the words of the *Xianping* era: *"The Dao De Jing is the essential guide for governing the world. Though Emperor Ming’s interpretations are brilliant and worthy of admiration, Wang Bi’s annotations are concise yet profound, truly capturing Laozi’s essence of purity and tranquility."* Since then, I have diligently sought Bi’s commentary, which is now rare in the present age. It was long before I obtained it, and in my former post as prefectural scholar of Jianning, I had it published.

Later, I acquired the annotated edition by Master Zhào Yǐdào, which does not separate *Dao* and *De* but arranges them as a continuous text, without chapter divisions. Delighted by its antiquity, I transcribed and preserved it. In the *Gēnyín* year of *Qiánshì* (1160), when I was assigned to teach in Jingkou, I had it engraved on wooden blocks for wider transmission.

As for the textual errors, earlier scholars could not verify them, so how dare I alter them? I leave this to those who truly understand. Recorded on the twenty-fourth day of the third month by Xiong Ke, Left Assistant Official and Professor of Jingzhou Prefecture.
